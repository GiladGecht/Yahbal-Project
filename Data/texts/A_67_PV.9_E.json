I would like also to \r\nthank Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its previous session, for all of \r\nhis efforts. We also commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nwise management of the affairs of the United Nations \r\nand his interest in the developments in my country.\r\nDuring the past few weeks the Islamic world has \r\nexperienced a wave of outrage and anger as the result of \r\na film containing explicit denigrations directed at the \r\nMuslim Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and \r\nthe values of true Islam. It is deplorable that a campaign \r\nexists with the aim of deliberately insulting Islam and \r\nMuslims in order to distort their image worldwide and \r\nto sow seeds of hatred between nations and religions. \r\nYet given all of that, such behaviour has attracted \r\npeople who defend the film based on the justification \r\nof freedom of expression. Those people, however, must \r\nnot overlook the fact that there should be limits on the \r\nfreedom of expression, especially if such freedom is \r\nused to blaspheme the beliefs of nations and defame \r\ntheir religious figures and symbols.\r\nWhile my country has strongly denounced \r\nthe film, it has also called for respect for religions \r\nand religious figures, enhanced understanding and \r\ndialogue between religions and civilizations, and the \r\nadoption of international instruments to prevent any \r\nfurther similar practice or abuse of the right to freedom \r\nof expression. My country also calls for adherence to \r\npeaceful expressions of opinion, while denouncing \r\nviolence and incitement to hatred that contradict the \r\nvalues of true Islam.\r\nThe current session of the Assembly is being held \r\nwithin the context of important global developments \r\nand events that are directly affecting political, \r\neconomic, social, security and environmental situations \r\nin all nations of the world. Those circumstances have \r\nresulted in various pressures on all international actors \r\nand have destructively impacted the least developed \r\nUnited Nations A/67/PV.9\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-seventh session\r\n9th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 26 September 2012, 9 a.m.\r\nNew York\r\nOffi cial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Jeremić . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (Serbia)\r\n2 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\ncountries — the so-called the countries of the \r\nSouth — including my country, the Republic of Yemen. \r\nThese days we are celebrating the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the 26 September 1962 Revolution and \r\nthe forty-ninth anniversary of the 14 October 1963 \r\nRevolution. I therefore take the opportunity to extend, \r\nfrom this international rostrum, my warmest greetings \r\nand best wishes to the great people of Yemen on this \r\noccasion. No doubt, the 50 years since the Yemeni \r\nrevolution have contributed to sparking the Yemeni \r\npeople’s aspirations for change and for freedom, \r\nequality and national dignity that resulted in a new \r\nreality where the wheel of change continues to turn, \r\ndespite all difficulties obstacles and barriers. \r\nRecently, we experienced the historic achievement \r\nof a peaceful transfer of power for the first time in the \r\ncountry. That transition would not have been possible \r\nwithout the Yemeni people’s determination to fulfil \r\nthe goals of the revolution: freedom, sovereignty, \r\nan end to autocratic and family rule forever, and the \r\nestablishment of a republican regime governed by the \r\nConstitution under a new social contract between the \r\nState and its people.\r\nAll Members know that Yemen is one of the so-\r\ncalled Arab Spring countries. We Yemenis experienced \r\na difficult situation for over a year that could have \r\nled to catastrophe. However, the country avoided that \r\ntrajectory because the disputing parties were wise \r\nenough to follow a role model designed to reach an \r\nagreement. Thus, they accepted the political settlement \r\nunder the initiative of the Cooperation Council for the \r\nArab States of the Gulf (GCC) and its implementation \r\nmechanism, which had become the accepted reference \r\nfor all parties and enjoyed international support. \r\nEarly presidential elections were conducted \r\nrepresenting a public referendum for change. The \r\nreferendum granted the new authorities full legitimacy \r\nto pursue the implementation of the provisions of the \r\nGCC initiative with a view to steering the country \r\ntowards the safe side and a brighter future where \r\npeople have faith in their future and can freely and with \r\nconviction choose their rulers and thus contribute to \r\nbuilding the new Yemen.\r\nIn that respect, please allow me to express my \r\ngratitude and appreciation to the Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud \r\nof Saudi Arabia, the leaders of the GCC countries \r\nand the Secretary General of the GCC, Mr. Abdellatif \r\nZayani, for all of the various forms of attention and \r\nsupport they have extended towards the political \r\nsettlement of the crisis. \r\nThanks also go to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; \r\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council; \r\nMr. Jamal Benomar, Special Adviser of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Yemen; the League of Arab States and its \r\nSecretary General; and the European Union for all \r\nof their efforts to bolster the political settlement and \r\nprovide the necessary economic support to Yemen in \r\nall areas, including for convening the national dialogue \r\nconference.\r\nThe conference will outline the future of Yemen by \r\naddressing various situations such as conflict, war and \r\npending problems, including the monopoly of power \r\nand wealth. The aim is to build a modern civil State \r\nbased on the principles of the rule of law, equality, \r\ninclusion, equal opportunity, the fair distribution of \r\nwealth, participation in decision-making and managing \r\nelements linked to the new State’s sovereignty at the \r\nnational level under a political regime to be decided by \r\nthe people of Yemen in the awaited national dialogue \r\nconference. I stress that the doors of the national \r\ndialogue conference are open to all Yemeni parties \r\nand all issues and demands. The conference shall be \r\nthe means for correcting mistakes, achieving national \r\nreconciliation and developing the principles of a \r\nmodern civil Yemeni State, under a unified Yemen, as \r\nstipulated by Security Council resolutions. \r\nThe current political arrangements in Yemen \r\nfor the implementation of the settlement agreement \r\nand resolutions 2014 (2011) and 2051 (2012) have the \r\nsupport of the brothers and friends of Yemen. However, \r\nYemen still faces many political, economic, security \r\nand social obstacles and impediments. Those obstacles \r\nrepresent weaknesses and jeopardize the progress \r\nand prosperity of Yemen in the coming decades. It is \r\na fact that 95 per cent of the Yemeni people have the \r\nwillingness and ambitions to move with the rest of the \r\nworld into the twenty-first century. The political and \r\nsocial problems and the escalating political conflicts, \r\nanarchy and acts of violence and extremism shall never \r\nstand as obstacles in the way of the Yemeni people. \r\nTherefore, the right way to address the situation in \r\nYemen is to adopt an overarching vision that takes into \r\naccount all circumstances and conditions related to the \r\ncountry’s history and geography and the challenges of \r\nthe present and the future. A key factor is the strategic \r\nlocation of Yemen at the juncture of trade routes and in \r\n12-52201 3\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nof the past year that have resulted in the displacement \r\nof more than 500,000 people from their villages, in \r\naddition to the increasing number of refugees from \r\nthe Horn of Africa region. That led the United Nations \r\nand its agencies to launch an appeal for approximately \r\n$600 million. However, the funding gap stands at \r\n50 per cent of the required amount. I therefore call \r\non brotherly and friendly countries to respond to the \r\nappeal of the United Nations to enable it to meet the \r\nbasic needs of internally displaced persons and refugees \r\nin our country.\r\nIt has been more than six decades since the General \r\nAssembly, which I have the honour to address today, \r\nissued the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It \r\nis deplorable that, after all these years, many nations \r\nstill suffer violations of their rights and dignity. The \r\nPalestinian people have been subjected to a gruesome \r\nescalation of Israeli violence. Israeli settlements are \r\nexpanding, innocent Palestinians are maimed, activists \r\nare besieged, prisoners and detainees are oppressed \r\nand the attempts of the Israeli side to demolish the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque are continuing. That requires a \r\nstronger role and a more united and effective presence \r\nof the United Nations and its various agencies against \r\nIsraeli arrogance and f louting of the resolutions of \r\nthe international community and its rejection of all \r\npeaceful proposals and initiatives. \r\nThe lack of international pressure on Israel \r\nrepresents a key failure in international justice standards. \r\nThe role of the United Nations and international forces \r\nin achieving justice and freedom requires the exertion \r\nof pressure to implement international resolutions. In \r\nthat regard, I ask: has Israel forgotten that its State \r\nwas created on the basis of an international resolution? \r\nWe declare our full support for the application of the \r\nState of Palestine to become a full State Member of \r\nthe United Nations in order to affirm its legitimacy \r\nand to ensure respect for its recognized rights under \r\ninternational law.\r\nWe also call on the United Nations to adopt \r\nappropriate solutions to end the crisis and internal war \r\nin Syria and to put an end to all forms of violence against \r\nthousands of civilians in Syria, including women and \r\nchildren. Proposed initiatives and announced peaceful \r\nsolutions shall be revived to end the crisis and to \r\nmake a success of the mission of the Joint Special \r\nRepresentative of the United Nations and the League of \r\nArab States for Syria, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi.\r\nthe heart of international sea navigation routes. Yemen \r\nfaces the security challenges of organized crime, piracy \r\nand terrorist acts, in addition to the influx of illegal \r\nmigrants and refugees to its coasts.\r\nThere is an increasing trend of unemployment \r\namong young people under 30, who represent 70 per \r\ncent of the total population of the country. The youth \r\nlook forward to a better future and a modern civil State. \r\nThat requires the international community and donor \r\ncountries to understand those factors and to provide \r\nurgently needed support to our country in various \r\nfields, including in the areas of establishing a modern \r\ncivil State based on democracy, good governance, \r\nrespect for human rights and social justice. There \r\nis a need to abandon the traditional standard and \r\nbureaucratic mechanisms adopted by donor countries \r\nand international parties supporting the path towards \r\nsettlement in Yemen. \r\nAs for us, we stand ready to provide a favourable \r\nand appropriate atmosphere for their work, absent of \r\nany complex Government bureaucracy, by adopting a \r\nhigh level of transparency and removing any obstacles \r\nthey may face. I confirm that it is investment that \r\nresults in stability, and not vice versa.\r\nTerrorists, who have pervaded our country for more \r\nthan 10 years and were recently poised to seize control \r\nof different Yemeni regions and provinces, represent a \r\nhuge threat to local, regional and international peace \r\nand stability. Although, following the heroic acts of the \r\nYemeni armed forces and local popular committees and \r\na series of defeats, Al-Qaida is today much weaker than \r\nbefore, we cannot underestimate its desperation. Due to \r\nits failure to adapt after its successive defeats, Al-Qaida \r\nhas equipped its members with explosive belts and \r\ntransformed them into time bombs against innocent \r\nand unarmed people. That has resulted in Al-Qaida \r\nlosing any local or national sympathy.\r\nWe reaffirm our commitment to eradicating \r\nterrorist elements and demand that its sources of \r\ninternal and external support be eliminated. We invite \r\nour international partners in the fight against terrorism \r\nto provide more logistical and technical support to our \r\nsecurity forces and counterterrorism units, and that \r\nthey expand intelligence cooperation and coordination \r\nin that field.\r\nI cannot pass up the opportunity to draw attention \r\nto the humanitarian crisis in Yemen as a result of the \r\nterrorism and acts of violence in Sadah and the events \r\n4 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nI reiterate the call on all concerned parties in Syria, \r\nthe Government and the insurgents, to heed and respond \r\nto repeated calls to initiate dialogue and make mutual \r\nconcessions as the only way to stop the bloodshed. \r\nThe only option for our brothers in Syria is to agree \r\non an initiative to mark the path towards change and a \r\npeaceful transfer of power through the ballot box.\r\nThere is no doubt that Somalia has been living in \r\ndire crisis since the early 1990s. Yemen and Somalia \r\nhave deep historical relations and both provide \r\nstrategic depth for each other. On that basis, Yemen \r\nplayed a leading role in restoring peace and stability \r\nin Somalia by supporting the reconciliation efforts \r\nand hosting various rounds of negotiations between \r\ndifferent parties. Yemen did not stop there; it opened its \r\ndoors to more than a million Somali refugees, despite \r\nthe difficult circumstances Yemen is encountering and \r\nall the economic, health and security impacts of the \r\nrefugee process.\r\nWhile we congratulate the Somali people on their \r\nsuccess on their accomplishing a peaceful transfer of \r\npower and electing Mr. Hassan Sheik Mohamud as their \r\nnew President in a democratic environment, we hope \r\nthat those elections will lead to reconstruction of State \r\ninstitutions; the restoration of peace and security to \r\nSomalia; and an end to the humanitarian suffering and \r\nits consequences, including the suffering of a million \r\nSomali refugees in our country. We reaffirm the \r\nRepublic of Yemen’s position of support for the elected \r\nSomali president and the Government he is forming. We \r\nwill spare no effort to enhance relations between our \r\ntwo brotherly countries for our mutual benefit and in \r\nthe interests of security and stability and of countering \r\nterrorism and piracy in the region.\r\nIn that context, the continuing and intensive influx \r\nof migrants and asylum seekers into Yemen represents \r\na real threat to national security, peace and stability \r\nin the region. It is essential that the international \r\ncommunity share that burden with Yemen, especially \r\nsince Yemen’s resources are being drained. Under the \r\nexceptional conditions that Yemen is dealing with, it is \r\nextremely difficult for us to cope with the continued \r\nf low of arrivals.\r\nThe brutal ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Myanmar \r\nmakes it incumbent on the international community to \r\npay attention to that humanitarian tragedy and take \r\nconcrete steps to stop the series of violent and savage \r\nacts being committed against that group. Considering \r\nthe acts of ethnic brutality and other practices that have \r\noccurred in recent months, it is not enough to issue \r\nstatements condemning and denouncing them. An \r\ninternational committee should be set up to investigate \r\nhuman rights violations against Muslims in that \r\ncountry, deliver humanitarian aid to them and provide \r\nguarantees to protect them against further violence and \r\natrocities.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate my thanks to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We greatly appreciate the role of the United \r\nNations as an international platform that brings together \r\nall countries and nations of the globe for the sake of \r\npeace, security, freedom, human rights and coexistence \r\nbetween nations, religions and civilizations and their \r\ncommon interests.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen \r\nJohnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, \r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Johnson-Sirleaf: I congratulate Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić and the people of Serbia on his election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. I would like to assure him of Liberia’s \r\nfull cooperation and support as he carries out the \r\nresponsibilities entrusted to him in steering the affairs \r\nof this session. I would also like to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of the \r\nState of Qatar, for his capable stewardship of the affairs \r\nof the sixty-sixth session and the many bold initiatives \r\n12-52201 5\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nundertaken in the interests of world peace during his \r\ntenure.\r\nMy highest commendation goes to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who continues to demonstrate \r\nsound leadership in the face of new and complicated \r\nchallenges. He has begun his second term with renewed \r\nvigour and a clear articulation of the priorities that \r\nrepresent the major concerns of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe selection of the theme for this session, which \r\ncalls for the settlement of disputes by peaceful means, \r\ncould not have been more appropriate. When we \r\nreview the state of the world, we see an international \r\nlandscape checkered with armed conflict, economic \r\ncrises and environmental degradation. For those who \r\nhave been through the painful experience of conflict, \r\nincluding my own country, Liberia, this year’s theme \r\nbecomes very pertinent. The cost of conflict in lives \r\nand infrastructural destruction makes us doubly \r\nappreciative of the value of preventive action in \r\naverting conflict. The need for conflict prevention \r\ntakes on added urgency, because most conflicts are \r\ninternal, engendered by marginalization, inequity and \r\ninjustice. It becomes imperative, therefore, to identify \r\nand remove those triggers of conflict before they cause \r\nexplosions.\r\nOur Government’s efforts to achieve the twin \r\nobjectives of conflict prevention and peace consolidation \r\nare being reinforced through our engagement with the \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding architecture of the \r\nUnited Nations. In an environment of peace, we have \r\nprioritized actions aimed at re-establishing the rule \r\nof law by building the capacity of our institutions \r\nand processes to deliver justice and security. We have \r\nformulated a road map for national reconciliation to \r\nensure that peace is sustainable.\r\nOur development partners, including the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies, have remained \r\nfaithful to our national agenda. They have supported \r\nour priority programmes for women’s empowerment, \r\nincreased agricultural productivity and food security, \r\nroads and infrastructure, and job creation. All the United \r\nNations agencies must be supplied with the capacity to \r\nprovide support to Government programmes in those \r\nareas. That is particularly critical for the new gender \r\nentity, UN-Women, which is the youngest among them \r\nand whose viability must be assured. We have made \r\nstrong strides in gender equality, but much more must \r\nbe done for girls’ education and women’s empowerment. \r\nTremendous progress has also been made in health-care \r\ndelivery.\r\nWe are particularly pleased by the recent UNICEF \r\nreport, which shows a sharp reduction in the level of \r\nchild mortality. However, there are still many challenges \r\nto overcome before we can ensure universal access to \r\nhealth care.\r\nMany developing countries, such as Liberia, have \r\nstructured their economies around the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While some countries \r\nhave made considerable progress in reaching some of \r\nthe Goals, many others will be unable to achieve them \r\nby 2015. There is an emerging consensus that efforts \r\nmust be accelerated in order to achieve maximum \r\nprogress in reaching the MDGs over the next three \r\nyears.\r\nI am honoured and humbled to have been selected \r\nby the Secretary-General as one of the co-Chairs of \r\nthe High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda. We are mindful of the \r\ndifficulty of our task, which requires us to propose a \r\nframework that builds on but goes beyond the MDGs \r\nin the establishment of goals that are ambitious but \r\nachievable. We know that the results of our work must \r\nreflect the broad political consensus of the public and \r\nprivate sectors and civil society. We know that the \r\ndefined goals should enable all people in all countries \r\nto be freed from the shackles of poverty through \r\nsustainable development.\r\nLiberia remains fully committed to the ideals and \r\npurposes of the United Nations. We believe that the \r\nOrganization should continue to occupy the centre of \r\nglobal governance by leading efforts to meet our collective \r\nchallenges to peace, security and development. To meet \r\nthat objective, the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform need to come to an early and \r\nlogical conclusion. My Government is encouraged \r\nthat an increasing number of Member States support \r\nthe enlargement of the Council in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent categories. That would ensure \r\na fairer and more equitable participation, reflective of \r\nthe world demography. In that regard, Liberia supports \r\nthe African common position, based on the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus adopted by the African Union.\r\nIn the same vein, we must ensure that the General \r\nAssembly is revitalized in order for it to fully assume \r\nall the responsibilities entrusted to it under the Charter. \r\n6 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nIt remains, after all, the most representative body of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe high-level United Nations Conference on the \r\nArms Trade Treaty, which ended recently here in New \r\nYork, sought to develop the highest possible international \r\nstandards for the trade in conventional weapons. \r\nHowever, strong national positions on that sensitive \r\nglobal issue prevented an agreement on a binding arms \r\ntrade treaty. Yet, nations of goodwill and countries like \r\nLiberia that have experienced devastation from the \r\nillicit trade in and diversion of conventional weapons \r\nmust continue our strong advocacy, taking into account \r\nthe full range of differences and disagreements. We \r\nwould therefore encourage bilateral consensus-building \r\nahead of a new round of negotiations. At the same time, \r\nwe are convinced that the final draft text of the arms \r\ntrade treaty, though imperfect and incomplete, contains \r\nessential elements, upon which future negotiations can \r\nsucceed. \r\nWe express our deep condolences on the death of \r\nthe United States Ambassador and staff and the Libyan \r\nnationals in the attack on the United States consulate \r\nin Benghazi. All nations should be concerned about \r\nthe spreading of violence in reaction to a film that \r\ndemonstrates unacceptable insensitivity to the Islamic \r\nfaith. Even in such circumstances, we must all be \r\nmindful that democracy requires freedom — freedom \r\nof ideas, freedom of association, freedom of religion \r\nand, more important, freedom of expression. That \r\noften results in statements and actions that may offend. \r\nTolerance, not violence, is the appropriate response to \r\nprevent further violence. Liberia is a clear example, \r\nwhere, were it not for our own tolerance of our new-\r\nfound freedom of expression, our country would be \r\nback in chaos.\r\nWhile the majority of the countries in our \r\nsubregion are consolidating economic and social \r\ngains, underpinned by democratic processes, some \r\nare, regrettably, still dogged by serious challenges \r\nthat risk undermining the peace and progress of the \r\nentire region. We in Liberia, like many other countries \r\nin the region and the world at large, were particularly \r\nappalled by the unconstitutional unravelling of the \r\ndemocratic Governments in Mali and Guinea-Bissau in \r\nthe early part of this year. We unequivocally condemn \r\nsuch attempts to seize power through unconstitutional \r\nmeans. \r\nAccordingly, Liberia endorses the decisions of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), which sought the full restoration of \r\nconstitutional order in both countries in the shortest \r\ntime. Liberia enjoins the world community, particularly \r\nthe Security Council, to buttress the efforts of ECOWAS \r\nin restoring peace in our region, most especially in \r\nMali.\r\nAs the current Chair of the four-nation Mano River \r\nUnion, comprising Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Liberia has committed itself to never \r\nallowing an inch of its territory to be used in order \r\nto destabilize its neighbours. In that context, we \r\ncategorically condemn all attempts to undermine the \r\npeace and democratic gains in Côte d’Ivoire and are \r\nworking closely with the Ivorian authorities and the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping bodies in both Liberia \r\nand Côte d’Ivoire to protect and consolidate the peace in \r\nour two countries. We call on all countries in our region \r\nto work in concert so that those intent on destabilizing \r\nsome parts of our region are treated as enemies in all \r\nparts of it.\r\nWe are all part of a rapidly changing world in which \r\nthe forces of globalization cannot be reversed. Our \r\nfarming systems must adjust to the unusual weather \r\nconditions. The places where we live and work will \r\nneed, in some cases, to be relocated from traditional \r\nsafe areas. Our societies must also find responses to the \r\ndistractions resulting from the demonstration effect. \r\nDeveloping countries, such as my own, must make \r\nglobalization work if we are to achieve our growth \r\ntargets and lift our people out of poverty. That means \r\ngreater commitment and effort on our part to create an \r\nenvironment that ensures economic growth based on \r\nmutual benefits and responsibilities.\r\nSince its founding, Liberia has been a complex \r\nnation, and the divisions that led to decades of war still \r\nrun deep.\r\nOur experience clearly shows that success has its \r\npitfalls. Displaced citizens returning from refugee \r\ncamps in the subregion and deportees from around the \r\nworld swell the ranks of the desperate unemployed, \r\nthereby intensifying our vulnerability. Communities \r\nlong deprived of basic services demand instant attention \r\nto their individual needs, thereby straining our capacity. \r\nCivil servants lacking a decent wage for two decades \r\nrightfully clamour for raises, thereby undermining the \r\nbudgetary process.\r\n12-52201 7\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nAs Liberia moves towards its tenth year of \r\nsustained peace, we can say with conviction that our \r\ncountry has turned the corner. Liberia is no longer a \r\nplace of conflict, war and deprivation. We are no longer \r\nthe country our citizens f led, our international partners \r\npitied and our neighbours feared. Our stabilization \r\nefforts over the past six years have resulted in average \r\nannual growth of over 6 per cent, major foreign \r\ninvestment, expanded fiscal space and unprecedented \r\ndebt cancellation. More important, we have earned our \r\nrightful place on an irreversible path to sustained peace, \r\ngrowth and development. Our Vision 2030, resulting \r\nfrom a robust nationwide consultation, is a long-\r\nterm programme for transformation that prioritizes \r\nyouth development, infrastructure, reconciliation and \r\ncapacity development.\r\nYet, our Government is keenly aware of the \r\nchallenges to be faced over the next three years. \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping forces are gradually \r\nbeing withdrawn from Liberia. In our discussions \r\nwith various United Nations teams that have come to \r\nLiberia — the technical assessment mission in March \r\nand the Security Council delegation in May — we \r\nhave emphasized the need for a responsible transition, \r\nthrough a gradual process occurring over a period \r\nof three to five years. We also seek the alignment of \r\ntransitional activities with our budget cycle, reflecting \r\nGovernment priorities.\r\nWe wish to express our appreciation to the United \r\nNations, which has been a very committed and effective \r\npartner. We owe the Organization much gratitude for \r\npreserving an enabling environment for peacebuilding \r\nand State-building.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to note that today, for the first \r\ntime in two generations, Liberia has a second successive \r\ndemocratic Government elected by the will of the \r\npeople. Despite the distractions, local and external, our \r\npeople are determined to take their destiny into their \r\nown hands, and determined that our ambitious goal of \r\nmaking Liberia a middle-income country by the year \r\n2030 will be achieved.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia for the statement she has just \r\nmade.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Michael Chilufya Sata, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Michael \r\nChilufya Sata, President of the Republic of Zambia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Sata: I am greatly honoured to deliver my \r\ninaugural address to the General Assembly. Allow me \r\nto begin by congratulating the President on his election \r\nto oversee the sixty-seventh session of the Assembly, \r\nand to wish him every success in his position. His great \r\ncountry, Serbia, has historically enjoyed close ties with \r\nZambia. We are therefore delighted to see him in that \r\nimportant seat.\r\nI would also like to thank His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for the steady manner in which \r\nhe has continued to steer our global Organization. In \r\nZambia we are particularly appreciative that, despite \r\nhis busy schedule, the Secretary-General made time to \r\nvisit our country earlier this year to undertake some \r\nimportant programmes.\r\nAbout a year ago, I ended my decade-long career \r\nas an opposition politician when the people of Zambia \r\noverwhelmingly chose to change their political \r\nleadership through a democratic and peaceful electoral \r\ntransition that ushered me into office as the fifth \r\nPresident of the Republic. I am indebted to the people \r\nof Zambia for once again undertaking that process in a \r\npeaceful manner.\r\nIt is my desire to utilize my experience at both \r\nends of the leadership spectrum to make a worthwhile \r\ncontribution to our democracy. I trust that Zambia will \r\nbe able to share its lessons, as well as to learn from those \r\nwith longer and even better democratic experiences.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, we still face considerable \r\nchallenges with respect to meeting the basic needs of \r\nthe majority of the Zambian people. Shortly before I \r\ntook office, there was much publicity about our positive \r\n8 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nthe infrastructure and to human capital development. \r\nDespite those efforts, however, 60.5 per cent of the \r\nZambian people continue to live in poverty.\r\nMy Government attaches similar importance to \r\npromoting good governance. As such, we have put \r\nin place a robust anti-corruption programme with \r\nimproved and increased resources, which should \r\nset a new stage for our development. In addition, for \r\nthe first time, Zambia has entrusted the governance \r\nof our legislative and judicial institutions to our \r\nwomen. The Inspector-General of Police, the Chief \r\nJustice and the Deputy Chief Justice, the chair of the \r\nanti-corruption commission and the commissioner of \r\nthe drug enforcement commission are all women. I \r\nremain convinced that they will improve our record and \r\nsurpass the nation’s expectations.\r\nOur national programmes are also focused on \r\ncreating employment for our youth. Despite our vast \r\nnatural resources, unemployment continues to be the \r\nmost pressing problem for the younger generation. We \r\nare therefore looking to improve partnership with the \r\nvarious United Nations agencies and the rest of the \r\ninternational community to harness best practices from \r\nacross the world. After all, it is the youth of 2012 who \r\nhave made Zambia the African football champion.\r\nOur Government has recognized that without the \r\nrule of law, social justice and an independent judicial \r\nsystem Zambia will not be able to attain sustainable \r\nsocial and economic development. As an initial step in \r\nthat regard, our Government is currently undertaking \r\na constitutional review process that is intended to \r\nensure the primacy of the individual citizen and his \r\nliberties. We further wish to speed up the process of \r\ndomesticating the international conventions that seek \r\nto bridge the gaps for minorities. Special emphasis will \r\nalso be placed on improving the treatment of people \r\nwith mental and physical challenges.\r\nZambia participated in the process leading to the \r\nRio+20 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Over the years, we have learned to \r\nappreciate the transboundary nature of matters such \r\nas our common environment. I would like to express \r\nappreciation to the Government of Brazil, the Chair of \r\nthe Conference and all who made tremendous efforts \r\nto bring about the final outcome document of that \r\nhistoric conference. We are concerned, however, that \r\nas States Members of the United Nations we missed \r\nthe opportunity to develop a formidable international \r\nmacroeconomic indicators, but those results did not \r\ntrickle down to the average citizen.\r\nIn the quest to develop at the micro level, the focus \r\nof my new Government is on enhancing agricultural \r\nproductivity and access to markets for peasants and \r\nsmall-scale farmers, providing improved health \r\nservices as close to the families as possible, improving \r\nthe quality of education and facilitating access to decent \r\nhousing and accommodation.\r\nAs we draw closer to the 2015 deadline for meeting \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the international \r\ncommunity needs to maximize its efforts towards \r\nachieving all eight goals. Zambia has made steady \r\nprogress in achieving some of them.That is most visible \r\nin the education sector, which has seen an increase in \r\nthe net enrolment of children in primary schools, while \r\nthe health sector has seen reductions in the prevalence \r\nof HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.\r\nNotwithstanding our progress in tackling \r\ncommunicable diseases, Zambia is also attempting \r\nto address non-communicable diseases such as \r\nhypertension, diabetes and cancer.\r\nWhile still considering matters related to the \r\nhealth sector, allow me to mention that my Government \r\nrecently reviewed statistics that indicate that Zambia \r\nnow has the second-highest rate of cervical cancer in \r\nthe world. From 22 to 24 July, our capital, Lusaka, \r\nhosted the sixth annual Stop Cervical Cancer in Africa \r\nConference, made up by the Forum of African First \r\nLadies against Breast and Cervical Cancer and the \r\nAfrican Parliamentarians and Health Ministers against \r\nCancer. Just last year, former United States President \r\nGeorge W. Bush travelled to Lusaka to launch the \r\nPink Ribbon Red Ribbon campaign against breast and \r\ncervical cancer. He has since facilitated some generous \r\ncontributions for the facilities now in place to fight the \r\ndiseases. I would like to express the Zambian people’s \r\ndeep appreciation for all those efforts. However, the \r\nchallenges in the health sector and elsewhere do not end \r\nthere, and by no means have we stood by with folded \r\narms.\r\nSince my Government assumed power, in September \r\n2011, our country has seen reasonable improvements \r\nin our economy, with an inflation rate that is down to \r\n6.6 per cent and a gross domestic product growth rate \r\nof about 6 per cent, in spite of slow global economic \r\ntrends. That has been attributed to enhancement of the \r\ninvestment policy framework and to improvement of \r\n12-52201 9\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nand we need only look at the sovereign representation \r\nin this Hall to prove that.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that ongoing efforts to \r\nreform the United Nations be approached with renewed \r\nvigour. We are concerned that a seemingly difficult \r\ndeadlock has been created in the reform process of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn addition, I wish to reiterate that despite the slow \r\nprocess of the reform of the Security Council, Africa \r\nshould not relent or become frustrated. We should \r\nstand up and be counted. As enshrined in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, Africa must be \r\ngiven two permanent seats with a veto immediately \r\nexercisable and two non-permanent seats to correct \r\nthe historical injustice that the continent has suffered \r\nand also adhere to the geopolitical realities of modern \r\ntimes. Furthermore, the Council should improve its \r\nworking methods.\r\nI wish to appeal to all nations to renew their \r\ncommitment and to strive for new common ground \r\nwhere individual national interests take a back seat. \r\nJust as many international conventions have been \r\nsubject to innovative translations in the recent past, we \r\nmust plan to be as f lexible in creating a new United \r\nNations, sooner rather than later. To ignore this need \r\nfor transformation would be tantamount to killing the \r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Zambia for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Michael Chilufya Sata, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Grand Duke Henri \r\nof Luxembourg, the Grand Duke of the Grand \r\nDuchy of Luxembourg\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Grand Duke \r\nof the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\r\nHis Royal Highness Grand Duke Henri of \r\nLuxembourg, the Grand Duke of the Grand Duchy \r\nof Luxembourg, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nprocess for promoting sustainable development. \r\nThe failure to commit any funds to the means of \r\nimplementation, and indeed the little progress in \r\noutlining the sustainable development goals, has \r\nunderscored the lack of ambition in addressing our \r\ndeteriorating environment, worsening inequality and \r\na growing global population that shares the Earth’s \r\nlimited resources. In that instance, we failed the test for \r\nglobal solidarity.\r\nToday, Zambia is encouraged that three committed \r\nglobal citizens have been appointed as co-Chairs of the \r\nSecretary-General’s high-level panel to advise on the \r\npost-2015 global development agenda. We therefore \r\nwould like to congratulate His Excellency President \r\nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono of Indonesia, Her \r\nExcellency President Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia \r\nand His Excellency Prime Minister David Cameron of \r\nthe United Kingdom. We wish them every success as \r\nthey take on that onerous task. We must support the \r\nhigh-level panel to help recoup the lost opportunities of \r\nthe recent past. As I indicated earlier, we are still a long \r\nway from attaining the Millenium Development Goals. \r\nDiscarding them entirely would be to the detriment of \r\nthe poorer nations. I trust that the Secretary-General’s \r\npanel will take that into consideration.\r\nThe theme for this year’s session of the General \r\nAssembly, “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means”, \r\nis undeniably significant in the wake of the turmoil that \r\ncontinues to threaten international peace and security \r\nwith the persistent conflict situations on the African \r\ncontinent in places such as the Sudan, South Sudan, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, Mali and Somalia. I therefore wish to \r\nreport that our Government has in certain instances \r\nsupported measures to help mitigate the humanitarian \r\nsituation. I urge the international community to \r\nredouble its efforts in bringing peace to those troubled \r\nregions.\r\nFarther afield, but no less important, is the \r\nsituation in Syria, which has seen the indiscriminate \r\nkilling of many innocent people. There is a need for \r\nconcerted efforts to utilize peaceful means, such as \r\nmediation and negotiation, to put a halt to the killings \r\nand to restore peace to the country. Humanity has again \r\nbeen embarrassed by the unnecessary carnage. Despite \r\nthe trouble spots, Zambia remains convinced that the \r\nUnited Nations has since 1945 performed quite well. \r\nHowever, circumstances have since changed greatly, \r\n10 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Royal Highness Grand Duke \r\nHenri of Luxembourg, the Grand Duke of the Grand \r\nDuchy of Luxembourg.\r\nHis Royal Highness Grand Duke Henri (spoke in \r\nFrench): On behalf of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, \r\nlet me congratulate President Jeremić on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly. He can count on \r\nthe full support of my country as he assumes this major \r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe General Assembly is the central body of the \r\nUnited Nations architecture. Here all Member States \r\nare represented, and each has a vote, irrespective \r\nof its size, its population or its economic power. The \r\nAssembly truly is the concert of nations embodying \r\nthe principle of the sovereign equality of all Member \r\nStates. To President Jeremić, the conductor of the \r\nconcert of States here assembled, we wish inspiration, \r\npassion and wisdom.\r\nLuxembourg is proud to have been part, since the \r\nvery beginning, of the peace project that is the United \r\nNations.\r\nOur then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Joseph \r\nBeck, in presenting the Charter of the United Nations \r\nCharter — signed a few weeks earlier in San Francisco  — \r\nto the Luxembourg Parliament on 9 August 1945, spoke \r\nthe following visionary words: \r\n“It is in the work of the United Nations that our \r\ncountry found the hope of rebirth in its darkest \r\nhour; it is within the United Nations that it has \r\ntaken up its place as an independent State, as a free \r\ncountry; it is among these peaceful countries, just \r\nunited by the Organization of San Francisco in the \r\nwonderful hope of a lasting peace, that it will find \r\nthe guarantees of a future which are necessary for \r\nits renewal”.\r\nHistory has vindicated him. Determined, with the \r\nother peoples of the United Nations, to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, Luxembourg \r\nfound in the United Nations and in multilateralism \r\nin general the ideal framework to f lourish as an \r\nindependent, sovereign State, free to choose for \r\nitself. Luxembourg has been able to prosper thanks \r\nto the peace it has enjoyed since 1945. In return, we \r\nhave resolutely committed ourselves, within the \r\nUnited Nations, to contribute to building peace and \r\nto promoting sustainable development for the greatest \r\nnumber possible.\r\nPresident Jeremić has rightly chosen the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes as the theme of the general \r\ndebate at the current session. It is one of the overarching \r\nobjectives of our Organization, aimed at enabling it to \r\nmaintain international peace and security. To settle \r\ndisputes peacefully, the Charter has attributed a major \r\nrole not only to the Security Council, but also to the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to the International Court of \r\nJustice.\r\nThe Syrian crisis, which has lasted already 18 \r\nmonths, continues to get worse. It has now claimed more \r\nthan 20,000 victims. Repercussions on neighbouring \r\ncountries continue to intensify. The crisis is a call on \r\nour collective conscience and puts our commitment to \r\nthe test. Some are tempted to accuse the United Nations \r\nof inaction. However, the fault lies elsewhere. Those \r\nresponsible for the terrifying violence, the war crimes, \r\nthe egregious human rights violations and crimes \r\nagainst humanity committed in Syria will one day \r\nhave to answer for them. Such is Luxembourg’s firm \r\nconviction.\r\nThe failure to this day of attempts to resolve the \r\nSyrian crisis through peaceful means must not lead \r\nus to neglect the quest for political solutions to other \r\ncrises.\r\nLuxembourg has consistently advocated a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That \r\nconflict has been going on for far too long. It is \r\nessential that the parties resume direct negotiations and \r\nnegotiate a sustainable peace among themselves, with \r\nthe support of the Quartet. The path will no doubt be \r\narduous, but the objective is worth it for the Israelis, the \r\nPalestinians and the region as a whole. We would like to \r\nsee an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable \r\nState of Palestine, living side by side with the State of \r\nIsrael in peace and security.\r\nLuxembourg has for many years now supported the \r\nbuilding of the Palestinian State at both the political \r\nand the economic levels. We also support Palestine’s \r\naspirations to assume its place among the nations of the \r\nworld. We provide financial support to the Palestinian \r\nAuthority in order to assist it in making its public \r\nadministration and basic social services work, and we \r\nare also a reliable partner of the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast. Under an agreement signed in February 2012, \r\n12-52201 11\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nmaintenance of international peace and security — an \r\napproach that recognizes the intrinsic link between \r\nsecurity and development.\r\nIndeed, to ensure lasting peace, one must tackle the \r\nroot causes of conflicts. Luxembourg is concentrating \r\non two of these: social inequalities resulting from \r\npersistent poverty, and the increasing scarcity of natural \r\nresources as a result of climate change. \r\nThe fight against poverty is one of our stated \r\npriorities. Since 2000, Luxembourg has reached the goal \r\nset by the United Nations of dedicating at least 0.7 per \r\ncent of its gross national income to official development \r\nassistance. In 2009 and 2010, that assistance exceeded \r\nthe threshold of 1 per cent of our gross national income. \r\nThe Government of Luxembourg is determined to \r\nmaintain that effort despite budgetary constraints. Our \r\nassistance is benefiting the least developed countries \r\nin particular. Here again, we exceed the goal set by the \r\nUnited Nations by dedicating more than 0.2 per cent \r\nof our gross national income to those countries, the \r\nmajority of which are in Africa.\r\nBeyond simple statistics, those figures reflect our \r\nspirit of solidarity towards developing countries. That \r\nspirit drives not only our political decision-makers \r\nand our development cooperation experts but also the \r\nnumerous citizens who are acting through civil society \r\norganizations. My family is proud to participate in that \r\nmovement of solidarity. My wife, the Grand Duchess, \r\ninvests herself fully in the social sector as a UNICEF \r\nEminent Advocate for Children, notably in Burundi. \r\nShe has been passionate about microfinance for many \r\nyears and has completed numerous projects in that area. \r\nAs the report of the Secretary-General (A/67/1) \r\nhighlights, we have achieved, worldwide, some essential \r\ntargets of the Millennium Development Goals ahead \r\nof time. However, the effects of global warming are \r\ncatastrophic and are threatening to undo the progress \r\nthat has been accomplished. In the least developed \r\ncountries, the situation is particularly worrisome. It is \r\ntherefore essential that we act resolutely in that area.\r\nProgress has been made at the Conferences of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Cancún and then in Durban. We \r\nnow need further commitments to be made in terms of \r\nreducing carbon emissions. Another major challenge \r\nlies in the mobilization of adequate financial and \r\ntechnological resources to enable the most vulnerable \r\ncountries, in particular, the least developed countries, \r\nLuxembourg will provide assistance in the amount of \r\n€15 million to Palestine refugees throughout the period \r\n2012-2015.\r\nAllow me to give a few other examples to illustrate \r\nhow Luxembourg is contributing to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes. First, as was \r\nrecalled during the High-level Meeting on the Rule of \r\nLaw, Luxembourg was one of the very first States to \r\nrecognize the jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice as compulsory. The Court elucidates and \r\ndevelops international law and thereby strengthens \r\npeaceful relations between States. Next, Luxembourg \r\nsupports preventive diplomacy and mediation activities \r\nas well as the good offices undertaken by the United \r\nNations. Our support in that area also benefits regional \r\norganizations, such as the African Union. Finally, \r\nLuxembourg also supports civil society, as it did \r\nin 2010, when it backed the mediation efforts by the \r\nCommunity of Sant’Egidio between political and civil \r\nsociety actors in Guinea and the Niger.\r\nLuxembourg, a multicultural and multilingual State \r\nby virtue of its history, its geographical location and the \r\ncomposition of its population, has often played the role \r\nof mediator between its large European neighbours and \r\nwithin the European Union.\r\nBuilding on a balanced foreign policy, free \r\nfrom the legacy of a colonial past and defined by \r\nan unwavering commitment to multilateralism, \r\nLuxembourg is at the service of the United Nations \r\nwhen it comes to playing the role of honest broker and \r\nassuming the responsibilities that come with that role.\r\nIn 2009, moreover, Luxembourg had the honour of \r\nchairing the Economic and Social Council at a crucial \r\njuncture marked by the devastating effects of the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis of 2008. \r\nMy country has also been a linchpin of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission since its inception in 2005. \r\nSince February 2011, the Permanent Representative of \r\nLuxembourg to the United Nations, Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, has chaired the Guinea configuration of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. Luxembourg is honoured \r\nto be able to marshal the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity in support of the authorities in Conakry, \r\nwho have asked to be assisted in three priority areas: \r\nnational reconciliation, security sector reform, and \r\nyouth and women’s employment. Our commitment \r\nstems from our conviction that we need to adopt a \r\nglobal approach towards peacebuilding and towards the \r\n12 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nrepresentative of today’s realities and to make it more \r\neffective and transparent by continuing to improve its \r\nworking methods. \r\nAfrica should finally take its rightful place on the \r\nCouncil, in particular among the permanent members. \r\nIt is also important to ensure adequate representation \r\nfor small States, which represent the vast majority of \r\nthe Member States of the Organization.\r\nLuxembourg’s action in the United Nations \r\nsince 1945 can be summarized by three key words: \r\ncommitment, solidarity, responsibility. Yet, although \r\nLuxembourg has consistently proved its solidarity and \r\ncommitment and has taken on responsibilities at the \r\nUnited Nations, it has not ever had the honour of serving \r\non the Security Council. Building on its commitment to \r\npeacekeeping operations and peacebuilding activities, \r\nLuxembourg declared its candidature 11 years ago \r\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for \r\nthe period 2013-2014. Luxembourg stands ready to \r\nshare primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, which the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations have conferred on the \r\nSecurity Council under the Charter.\r\nCommitment to effective multilateralism does not \r\ndepend on size. During his official visit to Luxembourg \r\non 17 April 2012, when he addressed our Parliament \r\nand thus our country, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nmade the following eloquent pronouncement: \r\n“You have shown that it is not the size of a nation’s \r\nterritory that makes the difference. It is the size of a \r\nnation’s heart. It is the breadth of a nation’s vision. \r\nIt is the depth of a nation’s promise to the wider \r\nworld.”\r\nThat recognition honours us. It has further strengthened \r\nLuxembourg’s resolve to prove itself up to the task and \r\nto serve the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I thank the Grand Duke of the \r\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg for the statement he has \r\njust made. \r\nHis Royal Highness Grand Duke Henri of \r\nLuxembourg, Grand Duke of the Grand Duchy \r\nof Luxembourg, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nthe landlocked developing countries and the small island \r\ndeveloping States, to adapt to the effects of climate \r\nchange. Luxembourg is acting to meet that challenge. \r\nWe have thus decided to join an important programme \r\nof support for renewable energy that would meet the \r\nspecific needs of Pacific small island developing States.\r\nI personally attended the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development in Brazil in June in order \r\nto show how high a priority the sustainable development \r\nof our planet is for my country. None of us has the \r\nmeans to make it on our own. Our interdependence \r\npushes us to act together. It is a matter of survival. And \r\nit is within the United Nations that we must organize \r\nour collective survival.\r\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention another \r\npriority for Luxembourg in terms of conflict \r\nprevention, namely, disarmament and non-proliferation. \r\nLuxembourg promotes the constant search for security \r\nat the lowest level of armaments. It is a party to all \r\nrelevant global and regional treaties and conventions \r\nand, despite the setback that the international \r\ncommunity suffered this year, we remain committed \r\nto working towards an arms trade treaty, which would \r\nhelp Member States to effectively combat the scourge \r\nof uncontrolled arms circulation.\r\nWhen conflicts break out despite attempts to \r\nprevent them, Luxembourg does not shy away from \r\ncommitting itself. My country participates quite \r\nregularly and actively in peacekeeping operations. At \r\nthe present time, Luxembourg troops are contributing \r\nto efforts under the United Nations mandate in Kosovo, \r\nLebanon and Afghanistan. Through its contributions \r\nto European Union missions, Luxembourg has also \r\nassumed responsibilities in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, in the fight against piracy off the coast of \r\nSomalia and in the Sahel region, where the international \r\ncommunity must redouble its efforts to prevent terrorist \r\ngroups linked to transnational organized crime from \r\ntaking root.\r\nAll the areas of action I have touched upon here \r\nshow how indispensable the United Nations is. If \r\nwe are convinced of the relevance of a multilateral \r\napproach founded on the United Nations, we must \r\ngive the Organization the means to be a true centre \r\nof multilateral action. For that, we need to continue \r\nto press ahead with United Nations reform, including \r\nSecurity Council reform. We are all aware of the need \r\nto make the Security Council more inclusive and more \r\n12-52201 13\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nThat is why this year, when the situation in Syria \r\ndeteriorated, we immediately evacuated the first group \r\nof Ukrainian and Polish citizens who had stated their \r\nintention to return home. Let me assure the Assembly \r\nthat any Ukrainian aircraft and ships available for \r\nevacuation purposes in hot spots will always be at \r\nthe disposal of those in need of help, regardless of \r\ntheir nationality. Ukraine has approved a decision to \r\nextend humanitarian assistance using United Nations \r\nmechanisms to Syria’s internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees. I am confident that through the joint efforts of \r\nthe international community we will manage to ensure \r\nthe safety of the civilian population in Syria. I believe \r\nin international solidarity in that regard. \r\nRecently, on 11 September, we witnessed the \r\ntragic attack on the United States consulate in Libya. \r\nUkraine roundly condemns any act of violence against \r\ndiplomatic missions and their personnel.\r\nFor many years, Ukraine has actively supported \r\nthe expansion of preventive diplomacy in international \r\nrelations, with, of course, the leading role played by \r\nthe United Nations. Guided by that approach, Ukraine \r\ninitiated a dialogue in the Human Rights Council on the \r\nprevention of human rights violations, in particular by \r\ninitiating a relevant thematic resolution.\r\nMr. Kanda (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nEnsuring early conflict prevention was among \r\nthe key elements stressed by Ukraine during its first \r\nmembership in the Security Council as an independent \r\nState, in 2000-2001. We also are conducting relevant \r\nwork in the Peacebuilding Commission. The same goal \r\nfeatures among the priorities of Ukraine’s chairmanship \r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (OSCE) in 2013.\r\nWe intend, during our OSCE chairmanship, to \r\nmake every effort to strengthen security in our region \r\nand to consolidate the democratic institutions of \r\nMember States. We will also promote the enhancement \r\nof the OSCE’s efficiency as a regional organization, \r\nin accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. We will also underscore the need for \r\nnew impetus to be given to the resolution of protracted \r\nconflicts in Europe and to address new threats and \r\nchallenges to security, in particular energy security.\r\nWe will strive to increase OSCE efficiency in early \r\nconflict prevention. The Ukrainian chairmanship will \r\nactively contribute to the deepening of international \r\nAddress by Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President \r\nof Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will hear an address by the President of \r\nUkraine. \r\nMr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Viktor \r\nYanukovych, President of Ukraine, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\nPresident Yanukovych (spoke in Ukrainian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nUkraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session. I wish him every success in the \r\npost and hope that all his actions bear fruit.\r\nThe theme of this year’s debate, “Bringing about \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes or \r\nsituations by peaceful means”, is always a pressing \r\none. That imperative was enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations by its founding members, including \r\nUkraine. I am convinced that the fundamental principle \r\nof the peaceful settlement of disputes remains today \r\nthe cornerstone of the modern system of international \r\nrelations. It is the underlying mission of our Organization \r\nand the immediate duty of every Member State.\r\nToday, we are closely watching the situation in \r\nSyria, which remains extremely alarming. Ukraine \r\nshares the deep concern of the international community \r\nregarding the escalation of violence in that country. We \r\ncall on all relevant parties to make every effort to settle \r\nthe conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the universally \r\nrecognized principles of international law.\r\nThe people of Ukraine have never been and will \r\nnever be indifferent to human suffering. We make no \r\ndistinction between our grief and that of others. Last \r\nyear, thanks to Ukraine’s humanitarian mission to \r\nLibya, people of many nationalities, mostly women and \r\nchildren, were evacuated and saved from hostilities. In \r\nreferring to that case, we are speaking not just about \r\none action but about Ukraine’s resolute intention to use \r\nits capabilities to protect civilian populations in hot \r\nspots.\r\n14 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nas an important milestone in the development of \r\ninternational cooperation under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations in that sphere. The outcome document \r\nof the Conference has proved the ability of countries \r\nof different political and economic weights to reach a \r\ncompromise, even in today’s difficult times.\r\nWe support the complex approach that has been \r\ninitiated in connection with sustainable energy for \r\nall, sustainable consumption and production, the \r\nelimination of hunger, and ensuring urban infrastructure \r\ndevelopment.\r\nUkraine welcomes the decision of the Conference \r\nto consolidate the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme with a view to a system-based management \r\nof the whole complex spectrum of environmental \r\nproblems.\r\nWe deeply appreciate the establishment of a high-\r\nlevel political forum on sustainable development and \r\nthe creation of an intergovernmental working group \r\nthat will chart post-2015 sustainable development \r\ngoals. That theme is of special interest for Ukraine, \r\nas demonstrated by the voluntary presentation of \r\nUkraine’s national achievements with respect to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which took place \r\nat the Economic and Social Council in July. I avail \r\nmyself of this opportunity to assure the Assembly that \r\nparticipation in the sustainable development efforts of \r\nthe United Nations will remain Ukraine’s unwavering \r\npriority.\r\nGlobal, man-made climate change represents a \r\nthreat on a planetary scale. Therefore, we consider \r\nefforts to counteract that challenge to be a priority task \r\nfor humankind as a whole. Let me note that Ukraine \r\nhas voluntarily acceded to the second commitment \r\nperiod of the Kyoto Protocol, undertaking to reduce \r\nits greenhouse-gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020. \r\nBearing that in mind, Ukraine will also promote \r\ndiscussions, in the framework of its future OSCE \r\nchairmanship, on the environmental impact of energy-\r\nrelated man-made activity, energy efficiency and the \r\nuse of renewable energy sources.\r\nTurning to international security problems, I \r\nshould like to stress that Ukraine is deeply committed \r\nto the cause of bringing about a safer and more secure \r\nworld. That commitment emanates from the national \r\nconscience of the people of Ukraine, who have \r\nexperienced the scourge of war, totalitarianism and \r\nartificial famines, as well as the consequences of the \r\ncooperation and dialogue so as to maintain stability, \r\nresolve crisis situations and ensure post-conflict \r\nreconstruction. We will devote special attention to \r\nnegotiations on the Transdniestria conflict; Ukraine \r\nhas for many years actively participated in efforts to \r\nsettle that conflict.\r\nWe will promote in every possible way the Nagorno \r\nKarabakh settlement process, as well as the Geneva \r\ndiscussions on security and stability in the Caucasus.\r\nI would like to stress that Ukraine, as a non-bloc \r\nState, cannot but be concerned with the erosion of \r\nthe Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. \r\nWe consider that international legal document to be \r\na cornerstone of stability on the continent and that \r\ntherefore States parties should make every effort to \r\nensure its fully f ledged and efficient application.\r\nUkraine, in the framework of its OSCE \r\nchairmanship, will therefore pay special attention to \r\nthe resolution of the crisis surrounding that Treaty. \r\nPeaceful settlement and conflict prevention will be the \r\nfoundation and the starting point of Ukraine’s activities \r\nif it is elected to non-permanent membership in the \r\nSecurity Council for 2016-2017.\r\nAt the beginning of this year, Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon made public a five-year Action Agenda \r\nfor the Organization. We fully support the priorities \r\nidentified in the agenda and consider them a road map \r\nfor United Nations activities in the near future.\r\nWe are currently going through a period of \r\nunprecedented change. Unfortunately, and especially \r\nin view of the world crisis, there are global tendencies \r\ntowards the stagnation of economic development, \r\ngrowing poverty and social inequality, and increasing \r\ninstability in certain States and regions.\r\nIt stands to reason that the only way to effectively \r\ncounteract those threats is for the international \r\ncommunity to deploy joint efforts. In that regard, we \r\ndeem it especially advisable to increase the efficiency \r\nof international cooperation among security and law-\r\nenforcement agencies, develop best practices for \r\naddressing new challenges and threats, and introduce \r\nreliable confidence-building measures.\r\nIt should be noted that this year’s United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) left \r\nopen a number of issues, given the close interconnection \r\nof the environmental and socioeconomic aspects of \r\nmodern life. However, we view the Rio+20 Conference \r\n12-52201 15\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nUkraine welcomes the successful completion of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s High-level Meeting on the rule of \r\nlaw that took place here in New York on 24 September. \r\nAt the Meeting, Ukraine announced the political \r\nobligations that we will fulfil consistently. We are \r\ncertain that international efforts to ensure the rule of \r\nlaw should remain centred around the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, relevant international \r\norganizations should continue to play an important role \r\nin that sphere. For Ukraine, such an organization would \r\nbe the Council of Europe and its Venice Commission \r\nin particular. Our close cooperation with the Council \r\nand the Commission has assisted us in making steady \r\nreforms to ensure the rule of law and thereby realize \r\nour aspirations to European integration. That process \r\nis actively promoted by Ukraine’s Constitutional \r\nAssembly, a special political institution established to \r\nfind a nationwide consensus on the provisions of the \r\nbasic law. In the course of constructing and developing \r\nUkraine’s Constitution, we will study and take into \r\naccount best practices from other countries.\r\nI am deeply confident that global advances in each of \r\nthe crucial areas I have mentioned would be impossible \r\nwithout a United Nations that is more efficient, viable \r\nand updated to the realities of the twenty-first century. \r\nThe key here is to deepen United Nations reform, \r\nand primarily that of the Security Council. Ukraine’s \r\nposition is well known. We are ready to discuss all \r\nprogressive concepts of Security Council reform \r\ncapable of achieving the broadest possible consensus \r\namong States Members of the United Nations. The \r\nlatter invariably make allowances for the legitimate \r\nrequirements of all regional groups, in particular those \r\nof Eastern Europe. \r\nOnly the United Nations is up to the task of \r\nstrengthening humankind to face contemporary \r\nchallenges. The united will of all 193 Member States \r\nrepresents an overwhelming force capable of coping \r\nwith the most complicated global crises. We must \r\nstrengthen and preserve our unity. I believe that the \r\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly will be \r\nconducive to that noble goal.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ukraine for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nChernobyl disaster, the largest man-made disaster in \r\nhuman history.\r\nTherefore, Ukraine’s aspiration to save the world \r\nfrom tragedies similar to those that we have experienced \r\nstems from the very hearts of the Ukrainians people. \r\nDuring the more than two decades of its independence, \r\nUkraine has been a steadfast supporter of global \r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. We have \r\nvoluntarily renounced the third-largest nuclear arsenal \r\nin the world; we kept our word this year and completed \r\nthe removal of the last stocks of highly enriched \r\nuranium from our country.\r\nI consider those important steps, as well as \r\nthe Kyiv Summit on the Safe and Innovative Use \r\nof Nuclear Energy, held last year, to be examples \r\nworthy of following. I also view in that light the joint \r\ndeclaration by Ukraine, Mexico and Chile — countries \r\nthat have made special efforts to neutralize the risks \r\nof the exploitation of highly enriched uranium. The \r\ndeclaration remains open for signing. Unfortunately, \r\nthe ambitious goal of the gradual complete liquidation \r\nof nuclear weapons remains unachieved.\r\nIn that regard, we insist that the security guarantees \r\nfor States that have renounced their nuclear stockpiles \r\nand made other strategic concessions should be \r\nreflected in internationally binding legal instruments. \r\nThis year Ukraine marked the twentieth anniversary \r\nof its participation in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations.\r\nI am truly proud of the contribution of the sons and \r\ndaughters of Ukraine — servicemen, law enforcement \r\nofficers and civilian personnel who have served and \r\ncontinue to serve the noble ideals of peace under the \r\nUnited Nations f lag. During these years, over 34,000 \r\nUkrainians have performed noble peacekeeping \r\nmissions in over 20 international operations under the \r\nUnited Nations mandate, from Guatemala to Timor-\r\nLeste, from Croatia to Mozambique. The experience \r\nthey have acquired gives Ukraine the right to speak \r\nabout achievements and advantages, as well as \r\nabout problematic issues in modern United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. The latter include the \r\nthreatening situation related to air mobility and legal \r\ngaps in investigations of crimes committed against Blue \r\nHelmets. I count on the continued support of Ukraine’s \r\ninitiatives aimed at resolving the current problems \r\nfacing United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\n16 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nAddress by Mr. John Dramani Mahama, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Ghana.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. John Dramani Mahama, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mahama: In accordance with Ghanaian \r\ntradition and custom, I would like to begin with a basic \r\nbut essential courtesy by expressing, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of my beloved country, our \r\ndeepest gratitude and most profound appreciation to the \r\nUnited Nations and to the numerous world leaders who \r\nmourned with us following the sudden and untimely \r\ndeath of our former President, Mr. John Evans Atta \r\nMills. Ghanaians were touched by the many heartfelt \r\nmessages of condolence and the glowing tributes that \r\npoured in from all over the globe. Those messages of \r\ngoodwill strengthened us and enabled us to transcend \r\nthe adversity of an occurrence that was unprecedented \r\nin the history of Ghana.\r\nMr. Mills was a dedicated and honourable \r\nstatesman. He committed himself to bringing about \r\nimprovement not only in the lives of Ghanaians but also \r\nin the lives of all other Africans, and indeed in the lives \r\nof individuals throughout the world. His death was a \r\nsignificant loss, and I am certain that he will be sorely \r\nmissed by the international community.\r\nWith the first-hand knowledge of what it means \r\nfor a nation to lose its leader, I also want to take this \r\nopportunity, on behalf of all Ghanaians, to extend \r\ncondolences to the people of Ethiopia, Malawi and \r\nGuinea-Bissau, who also suffered the untimely demise \r\nof their sitting Presidents. May the souls of these great \r\nmen, who gave so self lessly and helped to move our \r\nnations forward, rest in perfect peace.\r\nOne of the lessons that I learned from the tragedy \r\nof Mr. Mills’s death — and it is a lesson worth \r\nsharing — is that it is during times such as these, times \r\nof great sorrow and pain, that we often reveal the very \r\nessence of who we are. That is as true of nations as it \r\nis of individuals. Over the past few months, Ghanaians \r\nhave shown ourselves to be resilient and respectful of \r\nthe values that promote peace and the institutions that \r\nsafeguard the stability of our democracy. In our process \r\nof healing from that great loss, we have become more \r\nunited and more determined to stay the course that we \r\nbegan in 1957, when we became the first sub-Saharan \r\nAfrican nation to gain independence. In the process \r\nof healing, we have become more confident than ever \r\nbefore in our ability to create a better Ghana for our \r\nchildren.\r\nToday’s assembly of Heads of State is being held at \r\na most critical time. Our world is being confronted with \r\na number of significant challenges. War, conflict and \r\nstrife are very much features of our present existence. \r\nPoverty, disease and famine continue to cripple the \r\nlives of many. Oppression, discrimination, illiteracy \r\nand unemployment still stif le the potential and shatter \r\nthe hopes of millions.\r\nAlthough examples of such conditions can be found \r\non every continent, for a while, whether rightly or \r\nwrongly, they seemed to be automatically and primarily \r\nassociated with Africa. Perhaps that is why it gives me \r\nsuch great pleasure to lead my address to the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session with news of \r\nprogress from Ghana and stories of success from the \r\nAfrican continent. Today, Africa boasts of some of the \r\nfastest-growing economies in the world, with Ghana \r\nbeing one of them. The number of countries engaged in \r\nconflict is steadily decreasing year after year. As that \r\nhappens, we are also witnessing a steady increase in the \r\nnumber of countries that are governed along democratic \r\nlines. As is true of all new democracies, those systems \r\nare not without their f laws. While they may not be \r\nperfect, however, they are promising.\r\nIn fact, three African countries that lost their \r\nleaders this year — Ethiopia, Malawi and, of course, \r\nGhana — experienced seamless and peaceful \r\nconstitutional transitions of power to a new leadership. \r\nMembers can see that, right now, something spectacular \r\nis happening in Africa. Growth is taking the place \r\nof stagnation; tranquillity the place of turmoil; and \r\ndemocratic governance, founded on the rule of law, the \r\nplace of dictatorship.\r\nThere is no denying the visibility and viability of \r\nsuch significant developments. At the very least, they \r\nrequire a re-examination of the long-held views and \r\nmisconceptions about the African continent. Those \r\n12-52201 17\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\ndevelopments must also find expression in the manner \r\nin which developed nations relate to Africa. In many \r\nways, that is already taking place, but the shift has only \r\njust begun. There is still much room for improvement. \r\nHowever, I am inspired by what I see, which are \r\nlimitless possibilities for Africa and its engagement \r\nwith the rest of the world.\r\nAs the United Nations Human Development Index \r\nattests, we in Ghana have made tremendous strides in a \r\nnumber of areas, with the aim of improving the living \r\nconditions of our people. Ghana is on track to achieve \r\nthe targets set under the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Significant progress has been made in the \r\nfollowing areas: reducing poverty, gender parity in \r\nschool enrolment, universal primary education, the \r\nprovision of safe drinking water and the fight against \r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nUnemployment is a challenge that exists on a \r\nglobal scale. Nearly all nations, be they developed or \r\ndeveloping, are grappling with finding ways to tackle \r\nthat potential threat to their economic stability. In \r\nGhana, we are attempting to deal with the problem as \r\naggressively and as effectively as possible by finding \r\nlong-term and sustainable solutions. That includes a \r\nprogramme that we will launch to encourage young \r\npeople to become entrepreneurs, owning their own \r\nbusinesses and thereby becoming employers rather \r\nthan employees.\r\nIn Africa, to say that the youth are our future is \r\nslightly misleading. Nearly 60 per cent of the continent’s \r\nentire population is below the age of 35. Our young \r\npeople are not only our future, but also our present. In \r\nGhana, we have been working assiduously to empower \r\nand support our youth so as to ensure that they will not \r\nbe left behind owing to fast-changing global economic, \r\neducational and social priorities.\r\nThe Government is implementing several social \r\nprotection programmes across various sectors to cushion \r\nthe poor and the vulnerable and to ensure that the fruits \r\nof our economic growth are distributed equitably. Under \r\nthose programmes, massive investments have been \r\nand are still being made in education, health care, the \r\nmodernization of agriculture, the social infrastructure \r\nand direct payments to the poorest households.\r\nIn furtherance of our battle against HIV/AIDS, a \r\nnew five-year national strategic plan has been launched \r\nto consolidate the gains already made in reducing the \r\nprevalence of the disease. Under the new plan, our target \r\nis to achieve the virtual elimination of mother-to-child \r\ntransmission and to expand access to antiretroviral \r\ntherapy for persons living with HIV/AIDS.\r\nThe Government of Ghana has committed \r\napproximately $80 million as its contribution to the \r\nfinancing of the new strategic plan. However, that is \r\nnot enough. We now find ourselves in a rather ironic \r\nsituation that is threatening the advances we have made \r\nthus far. Ghana, like several other developing countries \r\nthat have made remarkable headway in combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, is becoming a victim of its own success. \r\nAs the numbers associated with the disease — the \r\nrates of infection and the mortality — go down, so \r\ntoo do the figures in the global funding for HIV/AIDS \r\nprogrammes. That leaves a considerable financing gap \r\nfor many African countries, such as Ghana, that are \r\ntrying not only to maintain their progress but also to \r\nmove closer to the complete eradication of the disease.\r\nIn 1992, under the Constitution of its fourth \r\nrepublic, Ghana established itself as a multiparty \r\ndemocracy. Since then, we have held five successful \r\nelections, which have resulted in the smooth transfer \r\nof power from one democratically chosen leader to \r\nanother. When it comes to transparency in the electoral \r\nexercise, Ghana is, in fact, held up as an example of \r\nexcellence.\r\nWe are just a few weeks away from conducting \r\nour sixth presidential and parliamentary election. As \r\nPresident, I wish to assure the international community \r\nthat that election will also be free, fair and peaceful. \r\nI am so certain of our stability through that process \r\nthat I extend a warm welcome to any individual or \r\norganization that would like to come and monitor our \r\nelections.\r\nThe commitment to peace that I have pledged in \r\nthe past, and which I am pledging anew today, is in \r\nkeeping with a long-standing tradition that Ghana has \r\nestablished domestically and internationally. In the \r\n1960s, when Ghana deployed 8,800 soldiers to what \r\nis now the Democratic Republic of Congo, it went on \r\nrecord as the first African country to participate in \r\na United Nations peacekeeping mission. Since then, \r\nGhana has continued to be an active and key partner \r\nin the United Nations peacekeeping programme. It was \r\nrecently ranked among the 10 largest contributors of \r\npersonnel to peacekeeping operations over the years. \r\nCurrently, we have troops in five peacekeeping theatres \r\nthroughout the world.\r\n18 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nWe also reiterate our opposition to the continuous \r\nblockade on Cuba and call for an immediate lifting of \r\nthat embargo.\r\nThe twenty-first century can readily be described \r\nas the century for Africa. Last year, of the 10 fastest \r\ngrowing economies in the world, six were African. \r\nGhana, my own country, posted one of the highest \r\ngross domestic product growth rates, reaching as much \r\nas 14 per cent. Foreign direct investment amounted \r\nto some $1.5 billion across various sectors. That type \r\nof sustained growth in combination with security and \r\ndemocracy can only ensure an Africa that will bear no \r\nresemblance to the ghost of its former self. It will be an \r\nAfrica where we create equal opportunities for women \r\nto realize their full potential and where there is respect \r\nfor the rights of all human beings. The new Africa will \r\nwean itself from handouts and humanitarian relief. It \r\nwill not continue to succumb to the corruption and \r\noppression of despots.\r\nThe new Africa will stand on the world stage as \r\na mutual partner. True partnership, of course, must \r\nbe based on equality. When the founding fathers of \r\nthe United Nations established the Security Council \r\nsome 66 years ago, it was based on the reality of the \r\ntime. Almost seven decades later, the paradigms and \r\ndynamics of the world have shifted dramatically. The \r\nlines that divided our world and categorized it into \r\nhierarchies of first and third worlds — those lines were \r\ndrawn by settlers transforming once sovereign lands \r\ninto colonies and territories — all of those boundaries \r\nhave now become blurred.\r\nTechnology has made information more \r\nimmediately accessible to the general public and \r\nindividuals more accessible to one another. The world \r\nthat we know today is not the same world our fathers \r\nand grandfathers knew. Our world is smaller, more \r\nintegrated and familiar.\r\nThe current realities call for greater inclusion in \r\norder to consolidate our common security. They inform \r\nGhana’s call for an expansion of the Security Council \r\nto admit more members in order to have a meaningful \r\nimpact on the many challenges that we all face. Africa \r\nis ready for that true and sincere partnership. Our time \r\nhas come.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ghana for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nGhana’s consistent championing of peace is neither \r\naccidental nor coincidental, but by design and by \r\ndetermination. We have always recognized that peace is \r\ncritical to development and to the overall improvement \r\nand enrichment of our people’s lives. It is therefore no \r\nwonder that, in 1961, when United States President \r\nJohn F. Kennedy established the Peace Corps, its very \r\nfirst mission was in Ghana.\r\nIn the past two decades, Ghana’s position on peace \r\nhas been tested again and again as the West African \r\nsubregion was ravaged by one civil war after another. \r\nHowever, we held firm to that position and will continue \r\nto do so.\r\nBecause Ghana wishes to coexist harmoniously \r\nwith all our neighbours, when legislating policy, we \r\nare always conscious of the importance of peace. When \r\noffering asylum or a safe haven to refugees, we are \r\nalways protective of our borders, making certain that \r\npolitical conflict and ethnic tension do not cross over \r\nonto our soil. The unfolding tensions in Côte d’Ivoire \r\nand Mali have been and continue to be of particular \r\nconcern to us.\r\nLet me say that Ghana will not allow its territory to \r\nbe used to destabilize any other nation. We will not be \r\nthe storehouse for any resources or weapons that may \r\nbe used to disrupt the peace and development of another \r\nnation. We will not harbour any individual or group \r\nwhose intent is to use Ghana as a base of operations to \r\nundermine the safety and security of our neighbours.\r\nWe will work under the ECOWAS protocol and \r\nwill utilize whatever other tools of diplomacy are \r\nat our disposal to ensure that security and peace are \r\nestablished in Mali and Côte d’Ivoire and that those \r\ncountries find a place alongside their fellow African \r\ncountries in the continent’s march forward towards \r\nprosperity.\r\nGhana has a strong belief in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Under the principle \r\nof the self-determination of peoples, Ghana was the \r\nfirst sub-Saharan country to emerge from colonial \r\ndomination. Our nation’s founding father, Mr. Kwame \r\nNkrumah, proclaimed that the independence of Ghana is \r\nmeaningless unless it is linked with the total liberation \r\nof the African continent. In keeping with that right of \r\nself-determination, we wish to restate our support for an \r\nindependent, prosperous Palestinian State, coexisting \r\npeacefully with a free, stable Israeli State. \r\n12-52201 19\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nI am here to voice to the Assembly and to the \r\nwhole world the divine and humanitarian message of \r\nthe learned men and women of my country, a message \r\nthat Iran’s great orator and poet, Saadi, presented to \r\nhumanity in his eternal poetry:\r\n“Human beings are members of a whole, \r\nIn creation of one essence and soul, \r\nIf one member is aff licted with pain, \r\nOther members uneasy will remain.”\r\nI have talked over the past seven years about the \r\ncurrent challenges, solutions and prospects of the \r\nfuture world. Today, I want to raise and discuss such \r\nissues from a different perspective. Thousands of years \r\nhave passed since the children of Adam — peace be \r\nupon him — started to settle down in various parts of \r\nthe Earth. Peoples of different colours, inclinations, \r\nlanguages, customs and traditions persistently pursued \r\ntheir aspirations to build a noble society for a more \r\nbeautiful life, blessed with lasting peace, security and \r\nhappiness.\r\nDespite all of the efforts on the part of righteous \r\npeople and justice-seekers and the sufferings and pains \r\nendured by masses of people in the quest to achieve \r\nhappiness and victory, the history of humankind is \r\nmarked, except in rare cases, with unfulfilled dreams \r\nand failures.\r\nImagine, for a moment, that there had been no \r\negoism, distrust, malicious behaviour or dictatorships, \r\nwith no one violating the rights of others. Imagine that \r\nhumanitarian values had been viewed as the criterion \r\nfor social dignity instead of aff luence and consumerism\r\nImagine if humankind had not experienced the \r\nDark Ages and if the centres of power had not hindered \r\nthe f lourishing of knowledge and constructive thoughts. \r\nImagine if the Crusades and the ensuing periods of \r\nslavery and colonialism had not happened, and if the \r\nsuccessors of the Dark Ages had followed a course \r\nbased on humanitarian principles.\r\nImagine if the First and Second World Wars in \r\nEurope, the wars in Korea, Viet Nam, Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and in the Balkans not happened, and if, \r\ninstead of the occupation of Palestine and imposition \r\nof a fake Government, displacement and genocide of \r\nmillions of people around the globe, the truth behind \r\nthose wars based on justice had been revealed. Imagine \r\nif Saddam Hussein had not invaded Iran and the big \r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. Salam (Lebanon), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud \r\nAhmadinejad, President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ahmadinejad (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): We have gathered \r\nhere to ponder and work together in order to build a \r\nbetter life for the entire human community and for our \r\nnations.\r\nComing from Iran — the land of glory and beauty, \r\nthe land of knowledge, culture, wisdom and morality, \r\nthe cradle of philosophy and mysticism, the land of \r\ncompassion and light, the land of scientists, scholars, \r\nphilosophers, masters of literature and writers, the \r\nland of Avicenna, Ferdowsi, Hafiz, Maulana, Attar, \r\nKhayyám and Shahriar — I represent a great and \r\nproud nation that is one of the founders of human \r\ncivilization and an inheritor of respected universal \r\nvalues. I represent a conscious nation that is dedicated \r\nto the cause of freedom, peace and compassion, a \r\nnation that has experienced the agony and bitter times \r\nof aggression and imposed wars and that profoundly \r\nvalues the blessings of peace and stability.\r\nI am now here for the eighth time in the eighth year \r\nof my service to the noble people in this Assembly of \r\nsisters and brothers from across the world to show to \r\nthe world that my noble nation, like its brilliant past, \r\nhas a global vision and welcomes any effort intended \r\nto provide and promote peace, stability and tranquility, \r\nwhich can be only realized through the harmony, \r\ncooperation and joint management of the world.\r\n20 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nthe rise and the gap between the rich and the poor is \r\nwidening. The total foreign debt of 18 industrialized \r\ncountries exceeds $60 trillion, while the repayment \r\nof half of that amount would be sufficient to eradicate \r\npoverty in the world. Economies dependent on \r\nconsumerism and the exploitation of people only serve \r\nthe interests of a limited number of countries.\r\nThe creation of worthless paper assets through \r\ninfluence and control over the world’s economic \r\ncentres constitutes the greatest abuse in history \r\nand is considered a major contributor to the global \r\neconomic crisis. It has been reported that $32 trillion \r\nin paper assets were printed by one Government alone. \r\nDevelopment planning, based on a capitalist economy, \r\nwhich runs in a vicious circle, triggers unhealthy and \r\ndevastating competition and is a failed practice.\r\nWith regard to the cultural situation, from the \r\nstandpoint of the politicians who control the centres of \r\nworld power, concepts such as moral principles, purity, \r\nhonesty, integrity, compassion and self-sacrifice are \r\ntypically rejected as defunct and outdated notions and \r\nan impediment to the accomplishment of their goals. \r\nThey openly talk about their disbelief in the relevance \r\nof ethics to political and social affairs.\r\nAuthentic and indigenous cultures, the product \r\nof centuries — old national efforts, the common \r\ndenominator of which reflects profound human feelings \r\nand love towards beauty and is the force that breeds \r\ndiversity, cultural life and social dynamism, are under \r\nconstant attacks and risk extinction. A specific lifestyle, \r\ndevoid of individual or social identity, is being imposed \r\non nations by the organized and systematic destruction \r\nand the humiliation of identities.\r\nThe family, the most noble social institution and \r\na centre emanating love and humankind, has been \r\nseriously weakened and its constructive role is on the \r\ndecline. The sublime role and nature of women as \r\nheavenly beings, manifestations of the divine image \r\nand beauty and the main pillars of every society, have \r\nbeen damaged and abused by the powerful and the \r\nwealthy. The human soul has become frustrated and the \r\nessence of humankind humiliated and suppressed.\r\nWith regard to the political and security situation, \r\nunilateralism, the application of double standards \r\nand the imposition of wars, instability and foreign \r\noccupation in order to ensure economic interests and \r\nexpand dominance over sensitive centres of the world \r\nhave become the order of the day. The arms race and \r\nPowers had supported the rights of the Iranian people \r\ninstead of siding with Saddam.\r\nImagine if the tragic incident of 11 September and \r\nthe military actions against Afghanistan and Iraq that \r\nleft millions killed and homeless had not happened, and \r\nif, instead of killing and throwing the culprit into the \r\nsea without trial or without informing the world and \r\npeople of America, an independent fact-finding team \r\nhad been formed to make the general public aware of \r\nthe truth behind the incident and to prepare the way for \r\nthe perpetrators to be brought to justice.\r\nImagine if extremism or terrorism had not been \r\nused to secure political goals, if arms had been turned \r\ninto pens, and if military expenditures had been used to \r\npromote well-being and amity among nations. Imagine \r\nif the drums of ethnic, religious or racial conflicts not \r\nbeen beaten, and if differences had not been used for \r\nthe purpose of advancing political agendas. \r\nImagine if the right to criticize the hegemonic \r\npolicies and actions of world Zionism had been \r\nrecognized so as to allow the world media to report \r\nfreely and shed light on the realities, instead of making \r\ndeceitful gestures of seeming to back freedom but in a \r\nway that offends the sanctities and most sacred beliefs \r\nof human beings and divine messengers, who, as the \r\npurest and most compassionate human beings, are the \r\ngift of the Almighty to humankind.\r\nImagine if the Security Council had not been under \r\nthe domination of a limited number of Governments, \r\nthus preventing the United Nations from carrying out \r\nits responsibilities in a just and equitable manner. \r\nImagine if international economic institutions had \r\nnot been under outside pressures and were allowed \r\nto perform their duties and functions by using their \r\nexpertise based on fairness and justice.\r\nImagine if world capitalists had not weakened or \r\nvictimized national economies in order to make up for \r\ntheir own mistakes. Imagine if integrity and honesty \r\nhad prevailed in international relations and if all nations \r\nand Governments were treated equally and justly in \r\nglobal efforts to build and expand happiness for all \r\nhumankind. And imagine if tens of other unfavourable \r\nsituations had not occurred throughout history, how \r\nbeautiful and pleasant our lives and how lovely the \r\nhistory of humankind would have been.\r\nLet us take a look at the state of the world today. \r\nWith regard to the economic situation, poverty is on \r\n12-52201 21\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\npassivity and willingness to live under the sway of the \r\nworld Powers.\r\nSuch are the arguments raised by those who tend \r\nto blame States for the unfavourable conditions that \r\nprevail around the world, with the aim of justifying \r\nthe attitudes and destructive behaviour of the ruling \r\nminority. Such supposedly genuine claims can in no \r\nway justify continuing with the current oppressive \r\ninternational order, because in fact poverty is being \r\nimposed on States, and the Powers’ are pursuing their \r\nambitions and goals either by deceit or by resort to \r\nforce. To justify their inhuman actions, they promote \r\nthe theory of the survival of the fittest.\r\nYet in principle, what most Governments and States \r\nand their peoples are seeking is fairness; they submit \r\nhumbly to what is right and what they want is to foster \r\ndignity, prosperity and constructive relations. The \r\nvast majority of people have no interest in expanding \r\ntheir territories, nor do they seek enormous wealth. \r\nThey have no disputes among themselves on matters \r\nof principle and have never played a part in unleashing \r\nthe disastrous events of history. I do not believe that \r\nMuslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists or others \r\nhave any problems among themselves, or are hostile \r\nto one another. They get along comfortably and live \r\ntogether in an atmosphere of peace and amity. They are \r\nall devoted to the cause of justice, purity and love.\r\nThe general tendency of States has always been \r\nto work towards positive common aspirations to the \r\nqualities that reflect great beauty and nobility, divine \r\nand human. The current abysmal state of the world \r\nand the bitter incidents of its history are due mainly to \r\niniquitous management by the self-proclaimed centres \r\nof power, which have dedicated themselves to the Devil. \r\nThe order that is rooted in the anti-human concepts of \r\nslavery and colonialism, old and new, is responsible \r\nfor poverty, corruption, ignorance, oppression and \r\ndiscrimination in every corner of the world.\r\nThe current world order has certain characteristics. \r\nIt is founded on materialism and thus is unmoored \r\nfrom moral values. It has been shaped by selfishness, \r\ndeception, hatred and animosity. It believes in \r\nlabelling human beings, humiliating other nations and \r\ndominating and trampling on the rights of others. It \r\nseeks to expand its domination by spreading discord \r\nand conflict among ethnic groups and nations. It aims \r\nto monopolize power, wealth, science and technology. \r\nThe policies of the world’s main centres of power are \r\nintimidation by nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \r\ndestruction by the hegemonic Powers have become \r\nprevalent. Testing new generations of ultra-modern \r\nweaponry and the pledge to disclose those armaments \r\nin due time is now being used as part of a new language \r\nof threat against nations to coerce them into accepting \r\na new era of hegemony. The continued threat by the \r\nuncivilized Zionists to resort to military action against \r\nour great nation is a clear example of this bitter reality. \r\nA state of mistrust has cast its shadow on international \r\nrelations, while there is no trusted or just authority \r\nto help resolve world conflicts. No one feels secure \r\nor safe, even those who have stockpiled thousands of \r\natomic bombs and other arms in their arsenals.\r\nWith regard to the environment, which is a common \r\nresource and heritage of all humankind that ensures \r\nman’s survival, it has been seriously damaged and \r\ndevastated as a result of the irresponsible and excessive \r\nuse of resources, particularly by capitalists across the \r\nworld. That situation that has caused massive drought, \r\nf lood, and pollution, inflicting irreparable damage and \r\nseriously jeopardizing human life on Earth.\r\nDespite advances in scientific knowledge and \r\ntechnology, the aspirations of Adam’s children have \r\nnot yet been fulfilled. Does anybody believe that the \r\ncontinuation of the current order is capable of bringing \r\nabout happiness for human society? Today everyone \r\nis discontented and disappointed with the current \r\ninternational order. Human beings do not deserve the \r\ncontinuous sufferings brought about by the present \r\nsituation. The God of wisdom and compassion, who \r\nloves all human beings, has not ordained such a destiny \r\nfor humankind. He has ordered humans, as the supreme \r\ncreatures, to make the best and most beautiful life on \r\nEarth along the lines of justice, love and dignity.\r\nWe must therefore think of a solution. Who is \r\nresponsible for all the sufferings and failures? Some \r\npeople try to justify it by saying that everything is \r\nnormal and a reflection of divine will, thereby putting \r\nthe blame on States for all prevalent vices and evils. \r\nThey are of the opinion that it is States that succumb to \r\ndiscrimination and tyranny. It is States that surrender \r\nto dictatorship and greed. \r\nIt is States that submit to the hegemony and \r\narrogance of expansionist Powers. It is States that are \r\ninfluenced by the propaganda tactics of other Powers, \r\nand most of the evils in our world are the result of their \r\n22 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\njointly becomes more real and the chances of putting it \r\ninto practice increase.\r\nTogether, therefore, we must trust in God Almighty \r\nand stand up to the rapacious minority with all our \r\nstrength in order to isolate them, so that they can no \r\nlonger decide the destiny of other nations. We must \r\nbelieve in the bounty of God’s blessing and mercy \r\nand seek it within the integration and unity of human \r\nsociety. Governments that are born of free national will \r\nmust believe in their own unlimited capabilities and \r\nknow that they can achieve victory if they fight fiercely \r\nto combat an unjust world order and to defend human \r\nrights.\r\nWe must lay the ground for united world rule by \r\ninsisting on justice in all its aspects, strengthening \r\nunity and friendship and expanding economic, social, \r\ncultural and political interaction in independent and \r\nspecialized organizations. We must care about the \r\ninterests of all the people of the world and join hands \r\nto reform the current United Nations entities with joint \r\nefforts and cooperation. The United Nations belongs to \r\nits Member States, and therefore the existence of any \r\ndiscrimination among those Members is a great insult \r\nto all. Any discrimination or monopolization of power \r\nin the Organization is unacceptable.\r\nWe must make a more coordinated effort to create, \r\npromote and firmly establish the language needed \r\nto enable us to design the bodies needed for a united \r\nworld rule that is imbued with justice, love, freedom \r\nand amity. Participation in global management is the \r\nbasis of lasting peace. \r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement, the second largest \r\ntransregional group after the United Nations, held its \r\nsixteenth summit in Tehran with the motto of “Joint \r\nglobal management”, cognizant of the importance \r\nof this issue and of the shortcomings of the current \r\nmismanagement in the emergence of crises and \r\nproblems aff licting the world today. During the summit, \r\nparticipating Heads of State and representatives of \r\nmore than 120 countries underscored the necessity of \r\nmore serious and effective participation of all nations \r\nin global management.\r\nFortunately, we are now at a historic juncture. On \r\nthe one hand, Marxism is no longer around; it has been \r\npractically eliminated from management systems. On \r\nthe other hand, capitalism is bogged down in a self-\r\nmade quagmire. Indeed, it has reached a deadlock and \r\nappears to be unable to come up with any noteworthy \r\nbased on the principles of domination and conquest. \r\nSuch Powers seek only supremacy; they do not desire \r\npeace and they definitely do not promote it in the \r\nservice of their nations.\r\nAre we to believe that those who spend hundreds \r\nof millions of dollars on election campaigns have the \r\ninterests of the peoples of the world at heart? Despite \r\nwhat the big political parties in the capitalist countries \r\nclaim, the money that goes into election campaigns is \r\nusually nothing but an investment on the part of the \r\nruling parties. In such countries, people have to vote for \r\nparties that represent only a small percentage of voters. \r\nThe will and views of the masses have little impact or \r\ninfluence on big decisions, especially those concerning \r\nmajor domestic and foreign policies in the United States \r\nand Europe. Their voices go unheard even when they \r\nconstitute 99 per cent of their societies. Human and \r\nethical values are sacrificed in order to win votes, and \r\nany willingness to listen to the demands of the people \r\nhas become merely a tool to be used at election time. \r\nThe current world order is discriminatory and based on \r\ninjustice.\r\nWhat should be done, and what is the way out of the \r\ncurrent situation? There is no doubt that the world is in \r\nneed of a new order and a fresh way of thinking. We \r\nneed an order that recognizes man as God’s supreme \r\ncreature, possessing both material and spiritual \r\nqualities and a pure and divine nature, filled with the \r\ndesire to seek justice and truth; that aims to restore \r\nhuman dignity and believes in universal happiness and \r\nthe possibility of perfection; that seeks peace, lasting \r\nsecurity and welfare for everyone, in all walks of life, \r\naround the globe; that is founded on trust and kindness \r\nand brings our thoughts, hearts and hands closer \r\ntogether and in which rulers love their people; that is \r\njust and fair, makes everybody equal before the law, \r\nand has no double standards; that allows world leaders \r\nto see themselves as committed servants of their people, \r\nnot their superiors; and that sees authority as a sacred \r\ngift from a people to its rulers, not an opportunity to \r\namass power and wealth.\r\nCan such an order exist without the contribution \r\nof all to the way the world is run? It is abundantly \r\nevident that when all peoples and Governments start \r\nto think, commit themselves to the aforementioned \r\nprinciples, focus on internationally important issues \r\nand participate in decision-making, it will be possible \r\nfor their desires to be realized. In raising collective \r\nawareness, the possibility of governing the world \r\n12-52201 23\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\ninherent potential of all the worthy men and women of \r\nall nations — he will lead humanity into achieving its \r\nglorious and eternal ideals.\r\nThe arrival of the ultimate saviour will mark a new \r\nbeginning, a rebirth and a resurrection. It will be the \r\nbeginning of peace, lasting security and genuine life. \r\nHis arrival will be the end of oppression, immorality, \r\npoverty and discrimination and the beginning of \r\njustice, love and empathy. He will come, and he will \r\ncut through ignorance, superstition and prejudice by \r\nopening the gates of science and knowledge. He will \r\nestablish a world brimming with prudence, and he \r\nwill prepare the ground for the collective, active and \r\nconstructive participation of all in global management. \r\nHe will come to grant kindness, hope, freedom and \r\ndignity to all humankind as a gift. He will come so that \r\nhumankind will taste the pleasure of being human and \r\nbeing in the company of other humans.\r\nHe will come so that hands will be joined, hearts \r\nwill be filled with love, and thoughts will be purified and \r\nwill be at the service of the security, welfare, happiness, \r\nwell-being and peace of all. He will come to return all \r\nthe children of Adam, irrespective of their skin color, \r\nto their innate origin after a long history of separation \r\nand division, linking them to eternal happiness and joy. \r\nThe arrival of the ultimate saviour, Jesus Christ and the \r\nrighteous, will bring about an eternally bright future \r\nfor humankind, not by force or by waging wars but \r\nthrough thought-awakening and developing kindness \r\nin everyone. Their arrival will breathe new life into the \r\ncold and frozen hearts and bodies of the world. He will \r\nbless humankind with a spring that puts an end to our \r\nwinter of ignorance, poverty and war with the tidings \r\nof a season of blossoming. He will end the winter of \r\nignorance for humankind.\r\nNow we can sense the sweet scent and the soulful \r\nbreeze of the spring, a spring that has just begun and \r\nthat does not belong to a specific race, ethnicity, nation \r\nor region, a spring that will soon reach all the territories \r\nin Asia, Europe, Africa and the Americas. He will be \r\nthe spring of all the justice seekers, freedom lovers \r\nand the followers of heavenly prophets. He will be the \r\nspring of humankind and the greenery of all ages. Let \r\nus join hands and clear the way for his eventual arrival, \r\nwith empathy and cooperation, in harmony and unity. \r\nLet us march on this path to salvation for the thirsty \r\nsouls of humankind to taste immortal joy and grace.\r\nsolutions to the world’s various economic, political, \r\nsecurity and cultural problems. The Non-Aligned \r\nMovement is proud to again emphasize the rightfulness \r\nof its historic decision to reject the power polarities and \r\nunbridled hegemony ruling the world. On behalf of the \r\nmembers of Non-Aligned Movement, I would like to \r\ninvite all the countries in the world to play a more active \r\nrole in making it possible for everybody to contribute to \r\nglobal decision-making processes. The need to remove \r\nstructural barriers and to encourage the process of \r\nuniversal participation in global management has never \r\nbeen greater.\r\nThe United Nations lacks the efficiency to bring \r\nabout the required changes. If this inefficiency persists, \r\nnations will lose hope in the ability of global structures \r\nto defend their rights. If the United Nations is not \r\nrestructured, international interactions and the spirit of \r\ncollective global cooperation will be tarnished, and the \r\nstanding of the United Nations will be damaged.\r\nThe United Nations, which was established with \r\nthe purpose of expanding justice and reinstituting \r\nuniversal human rights, has in practice been engulfed \r\nby discrimination, preparing a supportive ground for \r\ndomination by a few powerful countries. Consequently, \r\nUnited Nations inefficiency has increased. Moreover, \r\nthe existence of the veto right and monopolization of \r\npower in the Security Council have made it nearly \r\nimpossible to defend the rights of the nations.\r\nThe issue of United Nations restructuring is vital; \r\nthe need has been emphasized time and again by State \r\nrepresentatives. That goal that yet to be accomplished. \r\nI would like to urge the States Members of the United \r\nNations and the Secretary-General and his colleagues \r\nto place the issue high on their agenda and to devise \r\nan appropriate mechanism to make it happen. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement stands ready to aid the United \r\nNations in that essential endeavour. \r\nCreating peace and lasting security with a decent \r\nlife for all, although a great and historic mission, can \r\nbe accomplished. Almighty God has not left us alone in \r\nthat mission and has said that it will surely happen. If \r\nit does not, then that will contradict his wisdom. God \r\nhas promised us a man of kindness, a man who loves \r\npeople and absolute justice, a man who is a perfect \r\nhuman being, named the Imam Al-Mahdi — a man \r\nwho will come in the company of Jesus Christ and the \r\nrighteous. By using the inherent potential of all the \r\nworthy men and women of all nations — I repeat, the \r\n24 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nThe achievements in our country have been \r\nattained through respect for the rule of law, sound \r\npolicies, improved governance and open and innovative \r\ndemocracy. However, as all Kenyans recognize, \r\nwe still have a lot more work to do. Poverty, disease \r\nand unemployment still remain big challenges for \r\nus. Nevertheless, I am confident that we will seize \r\nopportunities to innovate and invest, and thus keep our \r\ncountry on the road to even greater prosperity.\r\nIn accordance with this year’s theme, “Bringing \r\nabout adjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations by peaceful means”, Kenya’s achievements \r\nover the past 10 years have been built on the bedrock \r\nof the peaceful resolution of disputes and situations in \r\nour country. In addition, it is our belief that inclusive \r\nsolutions to disputes can bring about lasting peace. We \r\nknow from our own history and that of our neighbours \r\nthat when conflicts and disagreements are not resolved \r\npeacefully what follows are the tragic consequences of \r\nsuffering, bloodshed and the collapse of economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nThat is why we are convinced that Kenya’s own \r\nwell-being and prosperity are hinged on sustained \r\npeace, security, stability and inclusive democracy in \r\nour region. My country therefore remains supportive \r\nof efforts spearheaded by the African Union, the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development, the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \r\nand the East African Community for the peaceful and \r\ninclusive settlement of disputes and situations. Such \r\nregional efforts are central to the future of multilateral \r\npeacebuilding. They must be the building blocks of \r\ninternational efforts to maintain peace and security in \r\nour region and the world.\r\nKenya therefore welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative to convene a series of high-level meetings \r\nduring this week to discuss the political and security \r\nsituations in Somalia, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Sudan and South Sudan. With regard to \r\nSomalia, Kenya joined the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia (AMISOM), and through the combined efforts \r\nof AMISOM and Transitional Federal Government \r\nforces, we have witnessed the progressive liberation of \r\nlarge areas of Somalia from Al-Shabaab occupation. \r\nThat development enabled the Transitional Government \r\nto focus on the implementation of the Kampala Accord \r\nroad map, with a view to forming a unified Government \r\nanchored on the pillars of good governance and the rule \r\nof law. We are encouraged by recent developments in \r\nLong live this spring, long live this spring — again \r\nand again, long live this spring.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mwai Kibaki, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kibaki: It is an honour and a pleasure \r\nfor me to once again address the General Assembly.\r\nKenya is at a time in its history that is full of hope \r\nfor a bright future. Over the past 10 years, our country \r\nhas enjoyed a sustained blossoming of democracy. \r\nIn the year 2010, Kenya adopted a new Constitution. \r\nWith that constitution, we further secured the human \r\nrights and civil liberties of our citizens and entrenched \r\nconstitutional governance and justice.\r\nEqually important, over the past 10 years, we have \r\nscored significant victories against diseases including \r\nHIV and AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other \r\nchildhood and adult maladies. Hundreds of thousands \r\nmore children have found their way into school and \r\nmany more adults have found new life skills through \r\ntraining and capacity-building. We have also pulled \r\nhundreds of thousands of Kenyans out of poverty and \r\nput them on the pathway to economic independence \r\nand self-reliance. In doing so, we have also expanded \r\nour economic base, opening up new and extensive \r\ninfrastructure, energy and information technology \r\nprojects.\r\n12-52201 25\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nthe peace and security of Israel are both assured and \r\nguaranteed. In that regard, it is our hope that Palestine \r\nwill soon be welcomed into the community of nations \r\nwith full membership in the United Nations.\r\nThere can be no lasting peace without sustainable \r\nand inclusive development. Kenya therefore greatly \r\nappreciates the achievements of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development held earlier \r\nthis year in Brazil. Kenya is encouraged that, in line \r\nwith recommendations proposed during the Conference, \r\nthe General Assembly has placed high on its agenda for \r\nthis session some of the decisions we took in Rio de \r\nJaneiro. That is indeed an indication of our collective \r\npolitical will to ensure that the decisions contained in \r\nthe outcome document are implemented. \r\nKey among those is the decision to strengthen the \r\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development, \r\nincluding the upgrading of the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP). Kenya appreciates \r\nthat historic decision to strengthen and upgrade UNEP, \r\nwhich will enable it to fulfil its mandate effectively. \r\nKenya reiterates its commitment to continue to host \r\nand facilitate the work of a revamped UNEP, and we \r\nlook forward to its eventual transformation into a full-\r\nf ledged organization for the global environment.\r\nFinally, we are all aware that many of our modern \r\ndisputes and conflicts revolve around concerns about \r\nwater, available land and agriculture, forests, rivers \r\nand lakes. Dealing with our environment and the \r\neffects of climate change is therefore an important part \r\nof resolving disputes and conflicts around the world. \r\nStrengthening global institutions that deal with the \r\nenvironment, biodiversity and climate change must \r\ntherefore be a core part of our strategy to avoid conflict \r\nand disputes among the peoples of the world.\r\nIt is important that, as the community of nations, \r\nwe invest in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes. However, we must invest first in the prevention \r\nof disputes and, secondly, in addressing the root causes \r\nof conflicts, such as poverty, inequality, disregard \r\nfor international law and disrespect for each other’s \r\nsociocultural and religious beliefs, among others. Only \r\nby addressing the root causes of conflict and disputes \r\ncan we hope to find lasting peace in a just and equitable \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nSomalia, in particular the election of a new President, \r\nPrime Minister and Parliament and the adoption of a \r\nnew Constitution.\r\nThere are millions of Somalis who are forced to live \r\noutside Somalia. More than 650,000 are in one refugee \r\ncamp in Kenya. Following the liberation of large \r\nsections of south-central Somalia from Al-Shabaab, \r\nwe look forward to working with the relevant United \r\nNations agencies and the international community \r\nin facilitating the return of Somali refugees to those \r\nareas. That will enable the effective participation of all \r\nSomalis in rebuilding Somalia.\r\nWith regard to the Republic of the Sudan and the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, Kenya is appreciative of \r\nthe positive developments of 4 August related to the \r\nlong-standing dispute over oil resources. We hope that \r\nthat important agreement marks a first step towards \r\nreducing tensions between the two sister countries. \r\nKenya also appreciates the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity, both directly and through the African \r\nUnion, and encourages the two sides to work towards \r\nreaching a compromise. I especially commend the \r\nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel \r\nfor its determination and leadership in steering the \r\nnegotiations. We are confident that both countries will \r\nagree to urgently address contentious issues on border \r\ndisputes. Kenya will continue to support efforts to find \r\na peaceful and lasting solution to disputes between the \r\npeople of the Sudan and South Sudan. We encourage \r\nthe international community to redouble its efforts to \r\nfast-track support for social and economic development \r\nin South Sudan for the benefit of citizens of the new \r\ncountry.\r\nKenyans are saddened by the great suffering and \r\nbloodshed endured by populations around the world, \r\nespecially in the Middle East, the Horn of Africa and \r\nCentral Africa. It is our belief that nations should \r\nembrace dialogue and the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes instead of rushing to arms, for suffering and \r\nbloodshed will ensue. We call upon all warring parties \r\nin the world to lay down their arms and pursue the \r\npath of peace, dialogue and the inclusive resolution of \r\ndisputes.\r\nWe also remain concerned that no progress has \r\nbeen achieved on the issue of Palestine. As I said last \r\nyear here in the General Assembly, Kenya believes in \r\nthe two-State solution, in which the territorial integrity \r\nof Palestine within the 1967 borders is upheld and \r\n26 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nthus far. The approach that suggests the military option \r\nfirst is not a suitable method for resolving complex \r\ninternal conflicts.\r\nThe hopes raised by the Arab Spring have been \r\njustified, but only to a certain extent. The civil war \r\nin Syria and the resulting toll in lives, as well as the \r\nUnited Nations and Arab League’s inability to contain \r\nit, cast a shadow across the entire region. The tragic \r\ndeath of American diplomats and the circumstances \r\nof their death should also prompt reflection among all \r\nthose persuaded of the automatic nature of democratic \r\ntransformations.\r\nWhen we signed the United Nations Charter, which \r\nis the constitution of the contemporary international \r\norder and testifies to our faith in a better world, we \r\npledged our readiness to make concerted efforts and \r\ncooperate in pursuit of the ideals invoked in it. One \r\nof the main paths to a more secure and fair world is \r\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts. That \r\nconcept is the main theme of this year’s session of the \r\nAssembly, and the choice of that subject is timely. In \r\nrecent years, we have seen numerous occasions in which \r\na commitment pursuant to Article 2 of the Charter was \r\nignored, with very dramatic consequences. The best \r\nexample is the crisis in Syria, but such situations also \r\noccur in other parts of the world. \r\nThroughout the twentieth century, the international \r\ncommunity developed various means and ways to \r\nachieve a peaceful settlement to disputes at both the \r\nglobal and regional level. Volumes have been written on \r\nthe subject. There are many international institutions \r\ninvolved in this field, as well as many renowned and \r\nprominent experts, diplomats and politicians. Some of \r\nthem, including Jimmy Carter and Martti Ahtisaari, \r\nhave been rightly acknowledged by being awarded a \r\nNobel Peace Prize. They were able to effectively use \r\nexisting procedures to quell conflicts and peacefully \r\nresolve difficult disputes of an international or \r\ninternal nature that otherwise could have escalated \r\ninto international conflicts. However, success was not \r\npossible everywhere. If success was not achieved, it \r\nwas because of the absence of one crucially important \r\nfactor without which it is impossible to settle a dispute \r\nin a peaceful, lasting and just manner, namely, realizing \r\nthe obvious truth that without compromise one cannot \r\narrive at a lasting solution to any conflict. That is \r\nembedded in the very nature of conflict.\r\nof the Republic of Kenya for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Mwai Kibaki, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bronisław Komorowski, President \r\nof the Republic of Poland\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Bronisław \r\nKomorowski, President of the Republic of Poland, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Komorowski (spoke in Polish; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): May I offer \r\nmy warm congratulations to Mr. Vuk Jeremić on his \r\nelection to the position of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session.\r\nFollowing the experiences of recent years, the world \r\nis poised at a difficult moment in its development. The \r\nweakness of international institutions in the face of \r\neconomic, security, humanitarian and environmental \r\nproblems is indisputable, and yet those institutions \r\nwere designed to resolve such problems. That also \r\napplies to the Security Council, especially in the \r\ncontext of the conflict in Syria. It is also clear that \r\ninternational financial institutions are not capable of \r\nhandling the destructive volatility of financial markets, \r\nwhich results from the opaqueness and arbitrariness of \r\npowerful private interests operating in this area.\r\nThe signals coming from Asia point to an \r\nundiminished number of tensions and disputes. We \r\nhave been following with concern the tension resulting \r\nfrom the Iranian nuclear programme. We are worried \r\nby the increasingly tangible threat of the proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction and of an intensified \r\narms race among the Gulf States. \r\nThe results of the Mission in Afghanistan are not \r\nentirely satisfactory. We must learn a lesson from the \r\nshortcomings of the strategy devised for that country \r\n12-52201 27\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nfor compromise can unfold. We expect that an end \r\nwill be soon put to the bloodshed in Syria and that the \r\nconflict will be settled on the basis of United Nations \r\nprinciples, using the instruments available to the \r\nOrganization. May the new United Nations envoy for \r\nthat conflict never lack determination in the fulfilment \r\nof his mission.\r\nAfter many centuries of antagonism, disputes and \r\nconflicts in Europe, yet another preventive method \r\nwas invented in order to do away with wars and stop \r\ndifferences and competing claims from turning into \r\nbloody crises. That method is the process of regional \r\nintegration, which was ushered in after the Second \r\nWorld War by the creation of the European Coal and \r\nSteel Community. The project’s hidden intention was \r\nto firmly establish the “no war” principle. It was not \r\nenough to ban war, as had been done through the \r\nKellogg-Briand Pact of 1928. What was needed was for \r\nwar to be made impossible by the process of integration. \r\nThrough the establishment of the Community and its \r\nexpansion to new areas of integration, including most of \r\nthe countries on the continent, the disputes threatening \r\nEurope’s security and peace were consigned to the past. \r\nEven if that experience cannot be used in a completely \r\ncopy-and-paste manner, it can still serve as an example \r\nto other regions of the world.\r\nThe plight of civilian populations, in particular \r\nchildren, is the most dramatic consequence of the lack \r\nto self-control and the absence of a culture of, and \r\nwillingness to, compromise in contemporary disputes \r\nand internal and international conflicts. The methods \r\nand means of combat spare soldiers, sometimes at the \r\nexpense of innocent civilians, especially children, \r\nwho often become a target of military operations. \r\nThis phenomenon is related to efforts to move the \r\naggression to the other side. The responsibility for \r\ncivilian casualties, even if unintended, can also fall on \r\ninternational and peacekeeping forces. \r\nBased on experience gathered by the international \r\ncommunity, the contentious idea of humanitarian \r\nintervention has been replaced with the concept of the \r\n“responsibility to protect”. I believe that this was a very \r\nwise path to take to end the stalemate that emerged in \r\nthis area more than 10 years ago. The concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect has been approved by the \r\nentire international community and has been a United \r\nNations norm since 2005.\r\nIn that connection, I would like to refer to the Polish \r\nexperience with the Solidarity movement and the round \r\ntable talks of the spring of 1989. Both sides of the deep \r\nsocial conflict of those days — the communist regime, \r\non the one hand, and the champions of democratic \r\ntransformation who ultimately strove to overthrow \r\ncommunism, on the other — demonstrated wisdom and \r\nwere thereby able to reach a compromise, even if it was \r\nnot fully satisfactory to either party. It was nevertheless \r\na compromise that opened perspectives for further \r\nchange, which extended beyond Poland to the entire \r\nregion of Central and Eastern Europe. What made that \r\ncompromise possible was the capacity for self-control \r\nby those actors who ultimately strove to achieve a \r\nrevolutionary change. Let us recall that all previous \r\nattempts undertaken by the democratic opposition \r\noutside the system ended in military interventions, \r\nbloodshed, tens of thousands of refugees and further \r\nrepression. That could have also been the case on a \r\nmassive scale in the spring of 1989.\r\nIn the long run, the capacity for self-control and \r\nthe strength of a wise compromise make a much better \r\nsolution than pushing one’s own demands and trying to \r\nadvance one’s own arguments by force. We know all too \r\nwell what happens in the latter case; it usually ends in \r\npeople taking up arms in order to prove their rightness \r\nby military means. In line with the rules of geopolitics, \r\nboth parties to a conflict seek allies abroad. Finally, \r\nthe logic of holding each other in check and an “all or \r\nnothing” mentality start to prevail. Costs are no longer \r\ncounted. As the conflict continues, the scale of the crisis \r\ngrows. The situation develops into a truly international \r\none. In order to fend off any further escalation of \r\nantagonisms, major humanitarian and stabilization \r\noperations supported by the army and police force are \r\ninevitable. The process of reconciliation, normalization \r\nand reconstruction is greatly delayed.\r\nWe have seen that process in various situations in \r\ndifferent countries. It can be avoided provided that, \r\nfrom the very outset of a dispute, both sides anticipate \r\ndialogue, acknowledge the limits of what is feasible, \r\nshow sensitivity to the potential costs of conflict and \r\nseek compromise. The art of self-control and of wise \r\ncompromise, embodied by Nobel Prize winners Lech \r\nWalesa and Nelson Mandela, are worth promoting. \r\nHowever, this approach is not promoted often \r\nenough in the context of efforts for peaceful conflict \r\nresolution and situations that may lead to conflict. \r\nSyria is a dramatic example of how a wasted chance \r\n28 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nPoland’s commitment to the stability of the \r\nEuropean integration process mirrors our understanding \r\nof the process as one that serves the security of all of \r\nEurope and its neighbourhood. That is why we actively \r\nendeavour to bring together the two parts of Europe once \r\ndivided by the Cold War. The European Union Eastern \r\nPartnership programme was designed to that end, with \r\nPoland and Sweden as its initiators and promoters. \r\nPoland readily offers support to and shares \r\nexperiences with countries and societies embarking \r\non the road to democracy in North Africa, Asia and \r\nEurope. To the extent we are able, Poland is involved \r\nin developing contact with countries from different \r\nregions and civilizations. Our policy in that regard \r\narises from the conviction that an effective United \r\nNations is as urgently needed today as it was in the \r\ndays of the Cold War. The world cannot be driven by \r\na bipolar or multipolar concert of Powers. Of course, \r\nalthough the Powers will not cease to exist, stability \r\nand regulation of the international legal order will \r\nrequire the more extensive engagement of multilateral \r\ninstitutions, as well as norms and mechanisms securing \r\nfull observance. Only the United Nations system can \r\nensure all of those. \r\nIn order to improve its effectiveness, we need \r\nto reform the Organization along the way, respect \r\nagreed norms and honour our commitments in good \r\nfaith. We recall that a return to a Hobbesian world is \r\nalways possible and that some people continue actively \r\nto bring it about. That is why Poland felt sorely tried \r\nunder the effects of the twentieth-century dramas. \r\nHowever, Poland is committed to promoting respect for \r\nthe principles, integrity and full implementation of the \r\noutput of our Organization. Such action will ensure that \r\nthe tasks we propose will be carried out effectively and \r\nthe United Nations will meet the expectations we set \r\nout at its very beginning and continue to promote today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Poland for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAs we know, a norm and its practice may sometimes \r\nbe worlds apart. Given the developments that have \r\nunfolded over the past decade, including several events \r\nin North Africa, and in the light of the humanitarian \r\ntragedies, in particular the suffering and death of \r\nthousands of innocent children, that should stir people’s \r\nhearts and consciences, we cannot afford for the \r\nresponsibility to protect to remain a dead letter. What \r\nwe put forward for the Assembly’s consideration is that \r\nthe United Nations should initiate work on defining \r\na catalogue of instruments to be applied in situations \r\nthat entail the responsibility to protect. This is about \r\nthe international community being effective without \r\nexceeding a mission’s mandate and inciting disputes on \r\nthat count.\r\nThis is a particularly important consideration for \r\nus in Poland. Our nation has more than once fallen \r\nvictim to crimes perpetrated on a mass scale. Prompted \r\nby that awareness, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, special \r\nrapporteur on crimes in the Balkans for the Human \r\nRights Commission, embarked on his mission 20 years \r\nago. The effectiveness of the international community \r\nwhen faced with f lagrant violations of human rights on \r\na mass scale and crimes and suffering that call for rapid \r\nreaction, as in Syria these days, depends largely upon \r\nthe credibility of our action in previous such situations. \r\nWe must always act in good faith and in line with the \r\nmandate given to us.\r\nI am speaking on behalf of a country that, over the \r\npast 20 years, has managed to travel the difficult road \r\nfrom a totalitarian regime, the collapse of its economy \r\nand mass social unrest curbed by force to democratic \r\nstability, economic growth and the ability to support \r\npeaceful transformations beyond its borders. Thirty \r\nyears ago, when martial law was imposed in order to \r\ncrush the Solidarity revolution, it was suggested that \r\nPoland’s attempt to enter the world of democracy would \r\nentail potential imbalances between the East and West, \r\nand even a war between the Warsaw Pact nations and \r\nNATO — in effect, a world war. \r\nFortunately, those days are gone. Hardly anyone \r\nwould think in such terms now. Today, Poland is a free \r\ncountry that develops its relations without limitations, \r\nshares its experience, spreads the word about the \r\nbenefits derived from our transition to democracy and \r\nextends development and humanitarian aid. We are a \r\ncountry that has had a positive economic growth rate \r\nfor the past 20 years. \r\n12-52201 29\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nThe Egyptian revolution that was founded on the \r\nlegitimacy that I represent before the Assembly today \r\nwas not the product of a f leeting moment, or a brief \r\nuprising. Nor was it the product of the winds of change \r\nof a certain spring or autumn. Rather, that revolution, \r\nand all the ones preceding it and following it in the \r\nregion, were triggered by the long-term struggle of \r\nindigenous national movements seeking a life of \r\npride and dignity for all citizens. It therefore reflects \r\nthe wisdom of history and is a clear warning to those \r\nattempting to put their interests before those of their \r\npeoples.\r\nWe are therefore striving to realize a new vision \r\nof Egypt that will serve as a programme of action \r\nfor the world and that will guide our cooperation \r\nwith the international community in a spirit of \r\nequality and mutual respect through the promotion \r\nof non-intervention in the affairs of States and the \r\nimplementation of international principles, agreements \r\nand instruments. Today we reiterate our commitment, \r\nparticularly to the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nEgypt took part in drafting.\r\nFrom that perspective, we continue efforts to \r\nresolve problems and address their root causes, without \r\nrelinquishing the principles of law or well-established \r\nvalues that, if compromised, could lead to grave \r\ninternational consequences if the rational and sincere \r\namong us choose not to pay heed.\r\nThe first issue that the global community must \r\nexert all efforts to resolve, on the basis of justice \r\nand dignity, is the Palestinian cause. Many decades \r\nhave passed since the Palestinian people expressed \r\ntheir desire to regain their full rights and build their \r\nindependent State, with Jerusalem as its capital. Despite \r\nthe continued struggle of the people via all legitimate \r\nmeans to attain their rights, and despite the acceptance \r\nby their representatives of the resolutions adopted by \r\nthe international community as a basis for resolving \r\nproblems, this issue of international legitimacy has to \r\ndate, unfortunately, remained without a resolution to \r\nachieve the hopes and aspirations of the Palestinian \r\npeople. And the resolutions agreed on the issue remain \r\nfar from implementation.\r\nThe fruits of dignity and freedom must not remain \r\nout of reach of the brotherly Palestinian people. It is \r\nshameful that the free world has accepted, without \r\nregard to the justifications provided, the continued \r\ndenial, by a member of the international community, \r\nAddress by Mr. Mohamed Morsy, President of the \r\nArab Republic of Egypt\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt.\r\nMr. Mohamed Morsy, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mohamed \r\nMorsy, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Morsy (spoke in Arabic): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to congratulate Mr. Vuk Jeremić and his \r\nfriendly country on his assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its current session. I wish him \r\nevery success in his task.\r\nI would like to express my sincere appreciation \r\nto the former President of the General Assembly, \r\nMr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, and the brotherly \r\nState of Qatar for their outstanding stewardship of the \r\nprevious session. I would also like to pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General for striving tirelessly to preserve the \r\nrole of the Organization and enhance its effectiveness. \r\nI assure him of Egypt’s support in all efforts extended \r\nfor that purpose.\r\nMy presence here today to address the General \r\nAssembly has multiple significance. I am the first \r\nEgyptian civilian President elected democratically \r\nand freely, following a great peaceful revolution \r\nhailed by the entire world. The revolution enjoyed \r\ngenuine legitimacy thanks to the efforts and will of \r\nall Egyptians, inside and outside of Egypt, and by the \r\ngrace of God. Today, every Egyptian shares a sense \r\nof self-confidence that allows each of them to claim a \r\nhigher moral and cultural ground. \r\nWe have taken several effective steps on the road \r\ntowards establishing the modern State aspired to by \r\nall Egyptians — one that is in tune with the present, \r\nbased on the rule of law, democracy and respect for \r\nhuman rights, a constitutional State that will not \r\ncompromise the values firmly embedded in the souls of \r\nall Egyptians, a State that seeks justice, truth, freedom, \r\ndignity and social justice.\r\n30 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nnegative effects extending beyond Syria and its \r\nimmediate neighbours.\r\nEgypt, along with the three other countries involved \r\nin our initiative, has held meetings that manifested \r\nmany areas of commonalities. We will continue to work \r\nto put an end to the suffering of the Syrian people and \r\nprovide them with an opportunity to choose freely the \r\nregime that best represents them. \r\nAfter the current regime comes to an end — the \r\nregime that is killing its own people day and night — the \r\nSyrian people will choose, by their own free will, \r\na regime that represents them and that places Syria \r\nin its proper position among democratic countries \r\ncontributing to the common march of the Arab people \r\nbased on its solid, legitimate, regional and international \r\nrole.\r\nI would like to emphasize here that the initiative is \r\nopen to all. It is not just the purview of its four starting \r\nparties, but is open to all who wish to positively \r\ncontribute to resolving the Syrian crisis and suffering, \r\nthat we are all responsible for. \r\nAll of us, the world over, must actively endeavour \r\nto put an end to the tragedy. It is the tragedy of the age, \r\nand our duty is to end it. \r\nEgypt is committed to continuing its sincere efforts \r\nto put an end to the catastrophe in Syria under an Arab, \r\nregional and international framework that preserves \r\nthe unity of that brotherly State. It would involve all \r\nfactions of the Syrian people without ethnic, religious or \r\ngender discrimination and would spare Syria the danger \r\nof foreign military intervention, which we oppose. \r\nEgypt is also committed to supporting the mission of \r\nMr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative of \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States for \r\nSyria, and to continuing the current efforts aimed at \r\nunifying the Syrian opposition and encouraging it to \r\npropose a comprehensive unified vision of an organized \r\ndemocratic transfer of power by measures that preserve \r\nthe rights of all constituencies in Syria, and maintain \r\ntheir essential positions in the new Syria — like the \r\nnew Egypt.\r\nI cannot fail to reiterate Egypt’s commitment to \r\nworking with the other Arab countries to ensure that the \r\nArab nation reclaims its rightful position in the world. \r\nThat is an integral component of Egypt’s vision of \r\nnational security and of the larger homeland extending \r\nfrom the Arab Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean — an area \r\nof the rights of a nation that, for decades, has longed \r\nfor independence. It is also disgraceful that settlement \r\nactivities have continued in the Palestinian territories, \r\nalong with the delay in implementing decisions of \r\ninternational legitimacy.\r\nProceeding from the perspective of defending \r\ntruth, freedom and dignity, and from my duty to \r\nsupport our Palestinian brothers and sisters, I place \r\nthe international community face to face with its \r\nobligatory responsibilities requiring the achievement \r\nof a just and comprehensive peace, an end to all forms \r\nof occupation of Arab land and the implementation of \r\nrelevant international resolutions. I call for immediate \r\nand significant measures to put an end to occupation, \r\nsettlement activities and any alteration to the identity \r\nof occupied Jerusalem.\r\nI call for peace that will establish a sovereign \r\nPalestinian State and achieve the security and stability \r\nlong sought by the peoples of the region. On the same \r\nbasis, I assure the Assembly of Egypt’s full support of \r\nany course of action that Palestine decides to follow in \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nI call upon all Member States, just as they have \r\nsupported the revolutions of the Arab peoples, to \r\nextend their support to the Palestinians and their \r\nendeavour to recover the full and legitimate rights of a \r\npeople struggling to regain its freedom and establish an \r\nindependent State of Palestine, based on the inalienable \r\nrights of the Palestinians.\r\nWe are determined to work to pursue all efforts of \r\nthe Palestinian people, in support of them and side by \r\nside until they freely regain all rights for all segments \r\nand communities of the population.\r\nFrom this rostrum and at this eminent gathering, \r\nI must address the issue that weighs heavily upon all \r\nof us, namely, the bloodshed and the human tragedy in \r\nSyria. The bloodshed must be halted immediately. That \r\nis our first concern. The blood being shed in the land of \r\nbeloved Syria is far too valuable to continue to lose day \r\nand night. The brotherly Syrian people, who are dear \r\nto the hearts of every Egyptian, deserve to hope for a \r\nfuture of freedom and dignity. That is the essence of \r\nthe initiative that I proposed in the Holy City of Mecca \r\nduring the recent month of Ramadan, and which I have \r\nreiterated on subsequent occasions. It aims to avoid the \r\nworst; to check the continued suffering of the Syrian \r\npeople and the devolvement of the conflict into a full \r\nscale civil war — God forbid — with concomitant \r\n12-52201 31\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nof the region have regained their freedom, they will \r\nneither tolerate, nor permit, being deprived of their \r\nrights, by either their own leaders or outside forces.\r\nThe will of the people, especially in our region, \r\nno longer accepts the continued non-accession of \r\nany country to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) and the non-application of the \r\nsafeguards regime to that country’s nuclear facilities, \r\nespecially if such action is coupled with irresponsible \r\npolicies or arbitrary threats. In that regard, the \r\ninternational community’s acceptance of the principle \r\nof pre-emption or attempts to legitimize it represents a \r\nserious matter that must be firmly confronted to avoid \r\nany tendency to promote the law of the jungle.\r\nCognizant of the danger that the status quo \r\nrepresents to the security of our important region, with \r\nits natural resources and trade corridors, Egypt stresses \r\nthe necessity of mobilizing international efforts to \r\nconvene the special conference on declaring the Middle \r\nEast a nuclear-weapon-free zone that is also free of \r\nother weapons of mass destruction, before the end of \r\nthe current year, with the participation of all concerned \r\nparties, without exception. \r\nI should like to say very clearly that the only \r\nsolution is to eliminate all nuclear weapons and all other \r\nweapons of mass destruction. There is no alternative. \r\nAt the same time, we also emphasize the right of all \r\ncountries of the region and of the world, including \r\nEgypt, of course, to the peaceful use of nuclear energy \r\nwithin the framework of the NPT, with a commitment \r\nto honour their obligations in that respect and provide \r\nthe necessary guarantees to the countries of the region, \r\nso as to avoid any doubt surrounding their peaceful \r\nnuclear programmes.\r\nIn our view, the concepts of justice, truth and \r\ndignity form the basis of the framework for governing \r\ninternational relations. \r\nA review of international relations would \r\nundoubtedly reveal the extent of the injustice that \r\nhas been inflicted upon the African continent. I do \r\nnot think it necessary to enumerate all the previous \r\npledges that have been made in the Hall to boost \r\ndevelopment and economic growth in Africa through \r\naid and investment. The world has a responsibility to \r\nsupport Africa’s efforts beyond mere promises and \r\ngood intentions; it must provide the assistance needed \r\nfor African countries to recover the treasures that were \r\nstolen from them over successive eras, the last of which \r\nthat thrives with opportunities for cooperation and \r\nconstructive engagement with the entire world.\r\nEgypt also believes that the extremely valuable \r\ncontribution of the Arab nation within the wider Islamic \r\nsphere is of vital necessity in promoting joint action \r\nwithin the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). \r\nEgypt will make every effort to ensure that the next \r\nOIC conference, to be held early next year in Egypt, \r\nwill strengthen mutual understanding between Islamic \r\ncountries and the rest of the world and set in motion \r\nthe principles of the dialogue among civilizations, by \r\neliminating the causes of misunderstandings used by \r\nfanatics on both sides to prove, wrongly, that differences \r\namong people are great and to achieve political goals \r\ncompletely unrelated to the noble ideals of religions, \r\nhuman values or ethics.\r\nToday more than ever, our brothers and sisters in \r\nthe Sudan need the Assembly’s support. The Sudan \r\nis seeking to achieve stability and development \r\nand is working to build sound and ideal relations \r\nwith South Sudan. I believe that the nascent State, \r\ntogether with the Sudan, is ready to become a centre \r\nof cooperation between the Arab world and African \r\ncountries. The Sudan has made great sacrifices in its \r\nquest for peace and stability. It has committed itself \r\nto the implementation of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement. It was also the first country to recognize \r\nthe nascent State of South Sudan. But let me be frank: \r\nit has not received the support it deserves. It is now high \r\ntime for international efforts to rally in support of the \r\nSudan and to work on settling differences between the \r\nSudan and its neighbour to the south in order to resolve \r\nall outstanding issues.\r\nAn early success of the brotherly Somali people \r\nduring the difficult transitional phase was to elect His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as President, \r\nwhich is a positive step towards unity and stability after \r\na very difficult period. I call upon the United Nations \r\nto continue to support the Somali Government’s efforts \r\nto fend off those seeking to hinder its efforts to achieve \r\nstability, reconstruct State institutions and realize the \r\naspirations of the Somali people for a better future.\r\nThe principles of justice and right are linked \r\nto achieving security and stability in the world, \r\nparticularly in the Middle East. Over many long years, \r\nsome have wrongfully sought to maintain stability \r\nthrough oppression and tyranny. Some of us have, alas, \r\napplauded their bad deeds. But now that the peoples \r\n32 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nshould not seek to impose on us concepts or cultures \r\nthat are unacceptable to us, nor should they politicize \r\ncertain issues and use them as a pretext to intervene in \r\nour affairs. \r\nWhat Muslims — and migrant Muslims — are \r\nexperiencing in a number of regions worldwide in \r\nterms of discrimination, basic human rights violations \r\nand vicious campaigns against what they hold sacred, is \r\nunacceptable. The behaviour of some individuals in that \r\nregard is absolutely unacceptable. We reject the insults \r\nheaped upon the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad — peace \r\nbe upon him — as unacceptable. We oppose those who \r\nhurl such insults. We will not allow anyone to insult the \r\nProphet in word or in deed. It runs counter to the most \r\nbasic principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nUnfortunately, such practices have acquired a name \r\ntoday — Islamophobia.\r\nWe all have to work together. We must join hands \r\nin confronting regressive ideas that hinder cooperation \r\namong us. We must move together to confront \r\nextremism, discrimination and incitement to hatred \r\nof others on the basis of religion or race. The General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council have the primary \r\nresponsibility for addressing a phenomenon that is \r\nstarting to have clear implications for international \r\npeace and security. \r\nThe obscenities that I have referred to, which are \r\npart of a recent organized campaign against Islamic \r\nsanctities, are unacceptable and require that we take a \r\nfirm stand. We have a responsibility at this international \r\nforum to look into how we can protect the world from \r\ninstability and insecurity. \r\nEgypt respects freedom of expression — a freedom \r\nof expression that is not used to incite hatred against \r\nanyone and that is not directed towards a specific \r\nreligion or culture. We support a freedom of expression \r\nthat addresses extremism and violence and does not \r\ndeepen ignorance or disregard others. As we have said \r\nbefore, we firmly oppose the use of violence as a means \r\nof expressing objection to obscenity and indecency.\r\nBefore I conclude, I must say that the severity \r\nand recurrence of financial and economic crises must \r\nlead us to a review of the international economic \r\ndecision-making processes that affect the fate of \r\npeoples who have not participated directly in those \r\nprocesses but yet are unfortunately the first to bear their \r\nnegative impacts on growth, trade, the environment \r\nand the social fabric of society, as a result of unfair \r\nbeing the period when some thought that supporting \r\nunjust regimes would help to achieve a false stability \r\nthat protected their interests, while those regimes \r\nmerely spread corruption and allowed for wealth to be \r\nsmuggled outside their countries. \r\nI am aware that the desired goals can only be \r\nachieved through the active participation of the peoples \r\nof the continent and their assumption of their own \r\nresponsibilities. That is something that we as Africans \r\nare ready and willing to undertake in our quest for a \r\nbetter future for our countries. Today, we as Africans \r\nhave to create for our continent a new set of ambitious \r\ngoals that would ensure that we are on the right track \r\ntowards sustainable development, the fulfilment of our \r\naspirations for a better future and the real participation \r\nof Africa in the international order. I assure the \r\nAssembly that Egypt will continue to support its \r\nbrothers and sisters in Africa, and that it is ready to \r\ncooperate with any stakeholder or party in or outside \r\nthe continent to raise living standards in Africa through \r\nthe exchange of expertise and successful practices.\r\nAs we contemplate the current international order, \r\nwe feel that there is a need to work diligently to repair \r\nit, based on principles that would renew its legitimacy \r\nand preserve its credibility. That is a legitimate demand \r\nof peoples and nations as they seek to participate \r\nin shaping a new world and a better future for their \r\nchildren.\r\nRevitalizing the role of the General Assembly \r\nas a democratic forum that expresses the will of the \r\ninternational community and reforming the structure \r\nof a Security Council, which still ref lects a bygone \r\nera, must remain our highest priorities and must be \r\nundertaken with due seriousness.\r\nI would like to emphasize the need for the United \r\nNations to give special attention to women’s issues \r\nand youth issues. During the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nsummit in Tehran, I proposed a new initiative to establish \r\na United Nations body dedicated solely to youth issues, \r\ngiving particular attention to education, training, \r\nemployment and improving youth participation in \r\npolitical life. The aim is to build the capacity of future \r\ngenerations to achieve their aspirations.\r\nEgypt would like to stress that the international \r\nsystem will not be fixed as long as we have double \r\nstandards. We expect from others, as others expect from \r\nus, respect for our cultural specificities and religious \r\npoints of reference. The world beyond our region \r\n12-52201 33\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nAddress by Mr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, \r\nPresident of the United Mexican States \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe United Mexican States.\r\nMr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President of the \r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Felipe \r\nCalderón Hinojosa, President of the United Mexican \r\nStates, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Calderón Hinojosa (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBy virtue of its historical conviction, Mexico has \r\nalways been a strategic ally of the United Nations. As \r\none of the founding Members of the United Nations, we \r\nfully share its fundamental precepts.\r\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly I \r\nwill attend as President of Mexico. Over the past six \r\nyears, my country has taken part in many different \r\nforums to pave the way for United Nations initiatives. \r\nWe have endeavoured to make it the main body for \r\ndialogue, peace and security, and for the rule of law, \r\nincluding, in particular, the effective exercise of \r\ninternational law. \r\nToday the world faces challenges that threaten the \r\nvery existence and viability of humankind. The first \r\nof those is the current economic emergency and the \r\nurgent need to promote global trade and growth with \r\nstrong job creation. That problem has plunged entire \r\npopulations in crisis and prevented developing nations \r\nfrom overcoming setbacks with respect to poverty, \r\nignorance and marginalization.\r\nWhen Mexico became President of the Group of \r\n20 (G-20) in 2012, our mission was clear: to reconcile \r\nthe apparently competing interests of developing and \r\ndeveloped nations. It is no secret that at the previous \r\nmeeting of the G-20, in Cannes, we were unable to \r\nmake as much progress as we would have liked towards \r\nadopting measures to advance the global economy. \r\nFor that reason, the Mexican Government made it a \r\npriority to build a broader consensus. We brought as \r\nmany countries as possible into the process, along \r\nwith representatives of the widest possible range of \r\nsectors, including unions, entrepreneurs, civil society \r\ntrade rules and practices and conditionalities imposed \r\non the transfer of technology and access to necessary \r\nfinancing for development. We urgently need a new \r\npeople-centred form of global economic governance that \r\naims at consolidating cooperation between development \r\npartners on the basis of mutual benefit and interests.\r\nI have laid out our vision, which is shared by the \r\nEgyptian people. I have also attempted to briefly outline \r\nEgypt’s views on the main issues, which is to say the \r\nvision of Egyptian youth, children, women and men, \r\nMuslim and non-Muslim, on all important questions in \r\nthe Middle East, Africa and the rest of the world. From \r\nthat perspective, I am sure that the United Nations is \r\ncapable of assuming its intended role of effectively \r\naddressing all global and regional issues and challenges \r\nthrough dialogue, understanding and joint cooperation, \r\nin accordance with the principles of international law.\r\nPost-revolutionary Egypt will spare no effort to \r\ndeal sincerely with all Members of the Organization. \r\nWe will always remain in the forefront of international \r\nendeavours aimed at achieving freedom, justice, social \r\njustice and dignity for all peoples, as well as security \r\nand stability for all our countries.\r\nI look forward with great optimism, and I see \r\nthe peace that we call for prevailing all over the \r\nworld — a peace based on justice and conferring on \r\nall their undiminished rights, a peace that does not \r\ndiscriminate between people for any reason. That peace \r\nwill not come about until we all cooperate, until we \r\nrealize that we are all equal and share many aspirations \r\nand ambitions. That is the peace whose message I bring \r\nto to the Assembly — a peace of right and justice, \r\nstability and development, interdependence of interests \r\nand benefits, love and mutual respect. I do not believe \r\nthat achieving this will raise difficulties for any of us \r\nif we extend the hand of cooperation, sincere intention \r\nand righteous work. God is our witness. We are all \r\nhopeful that we will see a better future for the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Arab Republic of Egypt for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Mohamed Morsy, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n34 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nand certainly not only at Europe. We also dealt with \r\nvarious pressing and important topics. We wanted to \r\nensure that countries would recover growth through a \r\nsustainable approach. We included several other items \r\nof extreme importance on the agenda, including green \r\ngrowth — to which I will refer later — food security \r\nfor our peoples and financial inclusion for the poorest. \r\nIn that regard, approximately 3 billion adults in the \r\nworld do not have access to financial services. That is \r\na clear obstacle to justice, but also to the efficiency and \r\ngrowth of our economies. That is why we in Mexico \r\nhave expanded people’s access to financial services. \r\nToday, banks offer simplified requirements for opening \r\naccounts. We are establishing a completely new bank \r\nthat functions through the use of cell phones, which \r\n80 per cent of the population own. We are offering, \r\nthrough bank intermediaries, financial services in the \r\nmost remote places. \r\nNot only has my Government been introducing \r\nprogrammes to promote justice and fight poverty, \r\nbut the majority of the support that we give to the \r\npoorest sectors of the population today is done \r\nthrough a financial inclusion effort. Our Opportunities \r\nProgramme is an innovative financial transaction \r\nprogramme for 6.5 million families, or over a quarter \r\nof the total population of Mexico, including the poorest \r\nfamilies. They receive monthly economic support to \r\npurchase food and cover basic needs as long as mothers \r\ntake their children to schools and to the doctor, as that \r\nis one of the best ways of structurally breaking the \r\ncycle of poverty. That support is delivered through \r\ndebit cards linked to an individual bank account, which \r\nthose 6.5 million poor families have perhaps never had \r\naccess to before. \r\nFood security was another other topic that we \r\nexplored at the G-20 Summit. The increase in food \r\nprices around the world largely explains why, besides the \r\npolitical reasons that might exist in any nation, people \r\nin North Africa and many other parts of the world have, \r\nfrom 2010 to the present time, taken to the streets. If the \r\npoorest families devote half of their income to buying \r\nfood and the price of that food increases by 10 or 20 per \r\ncent, we are talking about a net global impoverishment \r\nthat is higher than those percentages. We are saying \r\nthat one of the most tragic problems in the fight against \r\npoverty is preventing such enormous rises in global \r\nfood prices. \r\norganizations and youth, and we took their proposals to \r\nthe plenary meeting of the G-20.\r\nWe held many preparatory ministerial meetings \r\nover many months and managed to bring apparently \r\ndivergent positions closer together. That work was \r\ncritical in ensuring that the G-20 Summit in Los \r\nCabos last June achieved significant progress. While \r\nit is true that months ahead of time there were doubts \r\nabout the viability of the euro as the sole currency for \r\nmany European countries, the meeting in Los Cabos \r\nsolidified the Group’s commitment not only to that \r\ncurrency as a monetary unit but also to financial, fiscal \r\nand political unity in the eurozone. The commitments \r\nof the international financial institutions were spelled \r\nout in greater detail and broadened, in particular those \r\nof the European institutions, but also those of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). \r\nAmong the most significant achievements agreed \r\nat the Los Cabos G-20 Summit, I should like to mention \r\nthe long-term action plan that proposes to tackle the \r\ncurrent economic situation as well as to move forward \r\ntowards the full and lasting economic recovery that we \r\nall yearn for. It is also very important that we agreed \r\nto provide the greatest contribution to the resources of \r\nthe IMF in the history of the organization. More than \r\n$450 trillion was committed, and is available to help \r\ndeveloping or developed countries facing a critical \r\nfinancial situation as a result of the current economic \r\ncrisis. \r\nIt is true that financial problems in some European \r\ncountries persist. Those are problems that will take a \r\nlong time to recover from. But, from our point of view, \r\nthere is now more promise for a solution than there was \r\nbefore the G-20 meeting. The commitment on the part \r\nof the G-20 countries has been a valuable element, so \r\nmuch so that today the global economy is beginning to \r\nshow more optimistic signs of medium-term recovery \r\nthan we saw a little more than a year ago. That is why I \r\nbelieve that we are starting to see a turning point when \r\nit comes to economic prospects. We must all contribute \r\nto ensuring that the recovery in fact takes place through \r\nthe implementation of the commitments undertaken. \r\nThat should not keep us from undertaking further \r\nefforts. On the contrary, we must step up our efforts \r\nin order to overcome, once and for all, the global crisis \r\nand promote development in our societies.\r\nI would like to underscore that the Los Cabos \r\nSummit did not look only at the international crisis, \r\n12-52201 35\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\npower, also revolutionizing the competitiveness of \r\nMexican industry. \r\nWe have also achieved progress beyond the agreed \r\ngoals in terms of access to drinking water, information \r\ntechnologies and decent housing. Almost 650,000 \r\nmortgage credits for as many houses are provided every \r\nyear in our country, especially to workers who earn less \r\nthan $20 a day. All of those achievements put us on \r\ntrack to comply with one of the MDGs within the time \r\nframe established. \r\nGlobally, Mexico is aware of the fact that progress \r\nis uneven, but that should not be a reason to abandon \r\nour efforts. We must reinforce the progress we have \r\nmade and ensure that it continues. \r\nThat is why Mexico would suggest that we move \r\ntowards a second generation of MDGs that would be \r\nuniversal, measurable and adapted to distinct national \r\nrealities in areas such as gender equity, environmental \r\nprotection, green growth, education, food, access to \r\nwater and international democratic governance. That \r\nshould be a central part of the 2015 development agenda.\r\nThe third challenge is that of climate change. Its \r\nimpact could be irreversible, both for societies and in \r\nterms of national resources. I know that, in all of the \r\ncountries represented here, there is currently either \r\nan unprecedented drought or unprecedented f looding. \r\nHere in Manhattan, less than two years ago, there was a \r\nhurricane on Fifth Avenue for the first time in history. \r\nThere were also tornadoes in Maine and Massachusetts. \r\nClimate change is affecting all nations. This is a \r\nchallenge that threatens to overwhelm humankind. If \r\nwe do not tackle it today, the cost for each country to \r\ndeal with its consequences will be significantly greater. \r\nMexico is seeking to engage all of its capacities in \r\nprompting a sense of responsibility when it comes to \r\nthe fight against global warming. That is why we have \r\nset up a special unilateral programme to fight it. We \r\nare committed to reducing our yearly carbon dioxide \r\nemissions by 50 million tons for this year. We made that \r\ncommitment in 2008, and we are meeting it: by the end \r\nof the year we will have reached our goal. \r\nWe are also the first country to deliver a national \r\nmessage in the context of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. We have delivered four \r\nmessages to date, and today I will deliver Mexico’s \r\nfifth such message in that regard. I will report on how \r\nwe have complied with our commitments, as well as \r\nConcretely, we achieved agreements to promote \r\ngreater investment in technology and greater public \r\nand private investment in agriculture, so that, with the \r\nsame resources and the same land and water, we can \r\nproduce more and better food globally. Mexico took \r\nan active part in the green revolution at the beginning \r\nof the 1970s. Now we need another green revolution to \r\nproduce food. Mexico wants to be an active participant \r\nin that transformation of technology, public policy and \r\nfinancial cooperation that could provide food to the \r\npoorest people in the world. At the G-20 Summit, we \r\nshowed that it is possible to find a solution to urgent \r\nand topical problems, as well as to long-term problems.\r\nThe second challenge of the four I would like \r\nto mention today has to do with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which the United \r\nNations so wisely established. It is very clear that they \r\nencapsulate the yearnings of all of our peoples for a \r\nharmonious, humane and sustainable development. \r\nMy country, despite the unexpected rise in global food \r\nprices and the worst global economic crisis in living \r\nmemory, has made real progress in reaching the Goals. \r\nI would like to stress that Mexico is close to achieving \r\nthe MDGs. Three years from the deadline, we have \r\nachieved one of the greatest aspirations of any nation, \r\nwhether developed or developing, namely, universal \r\nhealth coverage. What does that mean? It means that \r\ntoday in Mexico we have doctors, medicine, treatment \r\nand hospitals for every Mexican man or woman who \r\nrequires it. That will allow us to comply with the \r\ncommitments taken on in the area of reducing mother \r\nand child mortality. We are also energetically tackling \r\nsuch problems as HIV/AIDS. In Mexico, we provide \r\nfree medical care and free antiretroviral drugs to all \r\nHIV/AIDS patients, thereby contributing to overcoming \r\nthat serious global challenge. \r\nFurthermore, not only have we achieved universal \r\nhealth coverage, but we have also provided universal \r\ncoverage when it comes to primary education. Today, \r\nevery boy and girl of school age — between 5 and \r\n13 years of age — has a place in a free public school. \r\nWe have also closed the gap between men and women \r\nso that they participate equally in basic education at \r\nalmost every level. \r\nWe have achieved important progress. We have \r\nbuilt over 1,200 new hospitals and clinics in six years \r\nand established 140 universities. Those are new free \r\npublic universities, where every year we train 113,000 \r\nengineers who are, besides enhancing their earning \r\n36 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nCOP 16 was a rather successful meeting. We reached \r\na first ever agreement on implementing an emissions \r\nreduction scheme for deforestation and degradation, \r\ncalled REDD-plus, which will enable developing \r\ncountries to contribute to reducing emissions while \r\npreserving and augmenting forests and jungles. \r\nThe greatest riches that poor countries have are their \r\nnatural capital, and developing countries do not pollute \r\nwith industries that they do not have. The greatest riches \r\nare forests and jungles, and carbon emissions come \r\nfrom deforestation. If developing countries are given \r\nthe support they need to preserve forests and jungles, \r\nwe will be contributing to reducing carbon emissions \r\nand helping to raise the income of those communities. \r\nWe agreed on that in Cancún at COP 16. \r\nThat success also points to a possibility that was \r\nfirst raised in the context of the fight against global \r\nwarming. We have managed to overcome the differences \r\nbetween developed and developing countries. We have \r\nmanaged to set aside the perverse game of blaming \r\neach other by saying either that the rich are to blame \r\nbecause they are the ones polluting, or that the poor are \r\nto blame because they are the ones emitting greenhouse \r\ngases. In this we are all responsible, and we all have to \r\nfind the solution. We are all responsible for the planet \r\nthat we share, which does not recognize our borders \r\nwhen it comes to the environment. \r\nThat is why the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility enabled us to reach \r\nreasonable agreements in Cancún. We set up the Green \r\nFund to fight climate change, as proposed by Mexico. \r\nWe established by consensus the clearly set threshold \r\nof an increase of no more than 2 degrees in the planet’s \r\ntemperature in the long term, a commitment to reduce \r\nemissions, an institutional framework for the adaptation \r\nto climate change and mechanisms for the financing \r\nand transfer of technology. Those achievements revived \r\nmultilateralism on the issue of climate change and were \r\nfolowed by the successful Climate Change Conference \r\nheld in Durban in 2011. \r\nThe fourth challenge — and I would like the \r\nAssembly’s special attention as I address this problem, \r\nwhich is responsible for more violent deaths around the \r\nworld than any other — is a problem that is costing \r\nthousands of young people their lives, in particular in \r\nour beloved region of Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\nI am talking about transnational organized crime, which \r\nis cutting short the lives of thousands of young people \r\nillustrate how we have managed to uncouple Mexico’s \r\neconomic growth from its greenhouse-gas emissions. \r\nIn the past two decades, our emissions have increased \r\nat a rate that is 40 per cent lower than our economic \r\ngrowth rate.\r\nWe are doing this because to challenge a false \r\nnotion that we have heard expressed here at the United \r\nNations and in every economic forum around the world. \r\nThe idea seems to be that we either grow or we tackle \r\nclimate change, we either put an end to poverty or we \r\nput an end to global warming. It would seem that we \r\ncannot do both at the same time, but I am here to say \r\nthat we can. I would even say that we should. We have \r\nto overcome the false dichotomy that exists between \r\nprotecting the environment and promoting economic \r\ngrowth, and between fighting poverty and fighting \r\nclimate change. \r\nIn Mexico, we are doing both at the same time. \r\nThrough ProÁrbol, for instance, which is a programme \r\nthat pays for environmental services, and is perhaps the \r\nlargest in the world to do so, we are paying poor and \r\nindigenous communities who live in forests and jungles \r\nfor the water that they give us and for the oxygen that \r\nwe breathe. We are paying them not to cut down trees, \r\nto restore their water basins so that those environmental \r\nservices will remain for us. With this programme, \r\nas we take care of our forests, we are also providing \r\nincome to the poorest communities, who have never had \r\nincome before. In the six years of the programme, we \r\nhave planted 1.3 billion trees in our country. I recall a \r\nUnited Nations programme five years ago that aimed at \r\nplanting 1 billion trees around the world. We took part \r\nin that programme enthusiastically. We have planted \r\n1.3 billion trees in six years and designated 3.5 million \r\nhectares as protected natural areas. \r\nA promising result of that effort is that, according \r\nto the Food and Agriculture Organization, Mexico has \r\nreduced its net deforestation rate from 350,000 hectares \r\nannually in the 1990s to 150,000 between 2005 and \r\n2010. I am sure that we will have reduced it further \r\nbetween 2010 and 2012. Our hope is that not only will \r\nwe achieve a rate of zero this decade, but that we will \r\nreverse deforestation around the world. \r\nWith respect to that challenge, working with \r\nthe United Nations, we were pleased to organize the \r\nsixteenth Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(COP 16) in Cancún, Mexico. Against all predictions, \r\n12-52201 37\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nOver the past six years, my Government has \r\ndecommissioned more than 150,000 weapons that had \r\nbeen in the hands of criminals. That is why Mexico \r\nadvocated for a treaty that would limit or ban, or at \r\nleast regulate, the transfer of conventional weapons, \r\nbecause we know there is a risk — we know that that \r\nhappens — that those weapons do not end up in the \r\nhands of good citizens who want to defend themselves; \r\nthey end up in the hands of criminals. That is why \r\nsuch a business exists, namely, to commit horrible and \r\nunprecedented violations of international law against \r\npeoples.\r\nThe trafficking of arms is only one aspect of that \r\nvery complex problem. Today, we have to acknowledge \r\nan undeniable truth: the illegal drug consumption \r\nin many developed countries is killing thousands of \r\nyoung people in producing and transiting countries. It \r\nfuels violence that our peoples do not deserve. Drug-\r\nconsuming countries have not made progress — or at \r\nleast not significantly — in reducing drug consumption. \r\nThere is much work to be done in that regard, both in \r\nterms of reducing demand and in preventing addiction. \r\nWe need to step up our efforts to deal with this public \r\nhealth problem through preventive policies, fighting \r\naddiction and media and information campaigns that \r\nwould make young people around the world understand \r\nthat drug addiction is the slavery of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. It is a heavy chain choking our young people \r\nto death.\r\nIn addition, we must also bear in mind the origins \r\nof the greatest power of criminal organizations. Where \r\ndoes it come from? It comes from the billions of dollars \r\nof economic resources financing them, which in turn \r\nf low from the drug-consuming countries. If we do not \r\nstop that avalanche of funds from consumers, organized \r\ncrime will continue to undermine peace and challenge \r\nwhole societies and Governments.\r\nThat is why here, in this pre-eminent global forum, \r\nI would like to say with the utmost clarity that the time \r\nhas come for consuming countries to ask themselves, \r\nhonestly and sincerely, whether they have the will and \r\nthe ability to reduce drug consumption significantly \r\nand substantially. Otherwise, if they cannot reduce that \r\nconsumption, they must urgently take decisive steps at \r\nleast to reduce the extraordinry f lows of money that \r\nend up in the hands of criminal organizations.\r\nI know that to date the approach taken has been \r\nwell intentioned, seeking to keep drugs out of the hands \r\nand constitutes one of the most serious global threats \r\nof our time. Criminal organizations form operational \r\nnetworks covering major illicit f lows not only of drugs \r\nbut also of arms, money and, unacceptably, of people. \r\nThey use violence to control their markets, supply and \r\nclients and to seize the income of the honest citizens of \r\nthe places they dominate. In that way, they seek to control \r\nterritories and co-opt Governments. They challenge \r\nthe strength of States themselves and take advantage \r\nof institutional weakness or bare-faced corruption to \r\nestablish power and impunity. They become entrenched \r\nin communities and control everything they can. They \r\nclaim money from honest people for their work. They \r\ncollect quotas from businesses and working people and \r\ncontrol other criminal activities such as extortion, theft \r\nand kidnapping. \r\nOrganized crime is one of the leading causes of \r\ndeath today. It is a leading engine of violence, which \r\nthe United Nations has an obligation to fight. It is one \r\nof the greatest threats facing democracy in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nMexico has suffered the consequences of this \r\nscourge, which, lamentably, has resulted from of years \r\nof inaction in the face of the unbridled expansion of \r\nsuch criminal activity. That is why protecting the \r\nfamilies and people of Mexico from criminality has \r\nbeen, for my Government, not only a constitutional \r\nlegal imperative but an absolute ethical and political \r\none as well. We have fought robustly, decisively and \r\ncourageously against that unacceptable threat to our \r\npeoples. We have done that based on our belief that our \r\nprincipal duty as a Government is to protect families.\r\nAt the same time, we have promoted a truly \r\nhistoric transformation of the institutions charged with \r\nenforcing the law by developing new and improved \r\npolice and judicial capacities in the fight for security. We \r\nrequire new and better capabilities that can cope with \r\nthe task of defending freedom and legality. However, \r\nwe regret that our efforts are not being matched in \r\nall the countries where they are needed. I would like \r\nto explicitly express my regret before the Assembly \r\nthat the diplomatic conference that took place here in \r\nJuly failed to reach an agreement on the adoption of \r\nan arms trade treaty. Such a treaty would have laid the \r\ngroundwork for controlling the irresponsible sale of \r\npowerful weapons to transnational organized criminal \r\ngroups.\r\n38 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nSome months later we convened representatives of \r\nall the countries of the hemisphere for the sixth Summit \r\nof the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, where several \r\nLatin American leaders reiterated our concern, and \r\ncountries from Canada to Chile reached an agreement \r\nto give a mandate to the Organization of American \r\nStates to make a scientific analysis of all possible \r\noptions to battle the scourge more effectively. We also \r\nagreed unanimously to establish a hemisphere-wide \r\nplan against transnational organized crime to foster \r\nreal-time cooperation among all the hemisphere’s law \r\nenforcement agencies.\r\nToday I formally propose that the United Nations \r\ncommit to making an in-depth assessment of the scale \r\nand limits of the current prohibitionist approach to \r\ndrugs. That does not mean giving up the fight or ceding \r\none inch to criminal organizations. We will never do \r\nthat. But what it does mean is that countries must take \r\nresponsibility, both the common responsibilities we all \r\nshare and differentiated responsibilities, in accordance \r\nwith each nation’s capacities..\r\nIn any case, irrespective of the regulatory \r\nframework, all nations, especially emerging ones \r\nlike Mexico, must implement a coherent policy, with \r\na three-pronged approach. The first obligation is to \r\nfight crime, not to run away from it and not to allow \r\ncriminals to establish territories as if they were a State. \r\nThe second is to strengthen laws and law enforcement \r\nagencies and institutions. In particular, we must purge \r\nand strengthen police forces, public prosecutors, \r\nGovernment ministers and judicial authorities. The \r\nthird and most important is to restore the social fabric. \r\nWe must increase opportunities for young people in the \r\nareas of education, health, employment and leisure. We \r\nmust do it through universities, music groups, soccer \r\nteams and clinics to prevent and treat drug addiction. \r\nWe must establish active and massive prevention \r\nand treatment policies for young people, including \r\nteenagers.\r\nWe are already doing that in Mexico. The \r\nthree-pronged approach is crucial for any democratic \r\nState, regardless of its political philosophy. Every State \r\nmust fight crime, improve law enforcement institutions \r\nand create opportunities.\r\nToday I call upon all States Members of the United \r\nNations to assume that responsibility, which so far has \r\nnot measured up to the magnitude of the problem of \r\norganized crime, which, I repeat, is the main cause \r\nof young people by pursuing the battle against drug \r\ntrafficking via legal means. But there is a fundamental \r\nproblem with that approach: it fuels the black market. \r\nThe enormous earnings that have been made possible \r\nthrough that market owing to the prohibition have in \r\nturn further fuelled greater ambitions among criminals \r\nand further increased the massive f low of resources \r\ntowards their organizations. That has allowed them to \r\ncreate powerful networks and given them an almost \r\nunlimited ability to corrupt. They are able to buy entire \r\nGovernments and entire police forces, leaving societies \r\nunarmed and families defenceless, especially in the \r\npoorest countries.\r\nWhile it is clear that powerful countries have \r\npowerful judicial authorities and police forces, what \r\nabout the poorest countries in our continents? I am \r\ntalking about our countries in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. But what will happen in Africa or Asia, or \r\nin the very many nations that do not have the economic \r\npower to tackle such criminals?\r\nLet us grasp once and for all that the ever-growing \r\ndemand for drugs gives the criminals an economic \r\npower that in some cases translates to political power \r\nsufficient to bend the will of the authorities to their own. \r\nI want to stress that all that money builds in them such \r\noverweening confidence that they abandon all scruples \r\nand commit the worst atrocities and acts of cruelty that \r\nhumankind has ever seen. Drug users’ money causes \r\nthe deaths of many thousands of young people in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean as a consequence of drug \r\ntrade violence. The countries that suffer most acutely \r\nthe devastating effects of the situation are countries like \r\nours that lie between the production zones in the Andes \r\nand the largest consumption market, the United States: \r\nColombia, Venezuela, Guatemala, El Salvador and \r\nHonduras, and, in the Caribbean, Haiti, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Jamaica and all other countries in that path. \r\nI would like to report that in December of last year \r\nthe heads of State and Government of Central America \r\nand of Mexico, Colombia and Chile met for what we \r\ncalled the Tuxtla cooperation mechanism and issued a \r\nvery important statement, the Mérida Declaration. It \r\nproclaims the urgent need to make a tangible reduction \r\nin demand for illegal drugs in consumer nations. We \r\nalso said that if that is impossible the authorities of \r\nthose countries have the moral obligation to explore \r\nevery possible means to eliminate the astronomical \r\nfinancial gains of criminals, including regulatory or \r\nmarket options. \r\n12-52201 39\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nI would also like to say that beyond tackling the four \r\nchallenges I referred to earlier, as a world community \r\nwe should strengthen the United Nations from the inside \r\nso that it is equipped to meet global challenges. The \r\ninitial task in that area is realistic, democratic reform \r\nof the Security Council to make it more representative \r\nand maintain its capacity for action by improving its \r\nworking methods and the accountability of its members.\r\nMexico also welcomes the fact that the President \r\nproposed “Bringing about adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations by peaceful means” \r\nas the main theme for this session. It is a crucial subject \r\nfor civilized coexistence and cooperation. As a country, \r\nMexico is committed to cooperation and the settlement \r\nof disputes. We are very concerned, as we know the \r\nAssembly is also, about the weakness and, at times, \r\nthe inertia of the Organization in the face of f lagrant \r\nviolations of international law. The grave situation in \r\nSyria, for example, is a danger to world peace and an \r\nindignity for all of us.\r\nWe condemn unreservedly the Damascus regime’s \r\nrepression and the violence it has inflicted on the \r\ncivilian population, which has lead to a refugee crisis in \r\nneighbouring countries. The paralysis of the Security \r\nCouncil in the face of such crises must drive us to renew \r\nour political will to change the Organization. Just as we \r\nhave transformed and embellished the United Nations \r\nbuilding and removed the asbestos residue that we \r\nlived with for so many years, so it is important that we \r\nrenovate the Organization in order to bring it in line \r\nwith the demands of the twenty-first century. \r\nWe also condemn the premeditated terrorist attack \r\non the United States Consulate in Benghazi and the \r\nassassination of the United States Ambassador and \r\nseveral members of his staff in Libya.\r\nI reiterate that Mexico will fully comply with \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals established by \r\nthis great Organization. That is evident in our human \r\ndevelopment indices for education, health, housing, \r\nemployment and social security. In the area of security, \r\nwe have steadfastly fought criminal groups, updated \r\nour laws and thoroughly restructured our institutions. \r\nAt the same time, we have continued to consolidate a \r\ndemocratic culture and respect for human rights. In \r\nMexico today we have enacted reform whereby any \r\nhuman right recognized in any international treaty \r\nsigned by Mexico also becomes internal law for \r\nMexican courts.\r\nof violent death in the world. That is something the \r\nUnited Nations must look at. If the developed countries \r\nthat consume ton upon ton of drugs on a daily basis \r\ncannot or do not want to reduce drug consumption, then \r\nat least they should stem the f low of money they are \r\nsending to criminals and stop the exorbitant f low of \r\nmoney whereby users finance the deaths of thousands \r\nof young people. If they cannot do so, I emphasize \r\nthat this is the time to explore different alternatives to \r\nreduce consumption. \r\nNow is the time for the United Nations not only to \r\ntake part in such an analysis but to lead in earnest a far-\r\nreaching international discussion, in order to take stock \r\nof the scale and limits of the current prohibitionist \r\napproach and to assess the brutal, unacceptable \r\nviolence generated by the production, distribution, \r\ntrafficking in and use of drugs. It is painful to say this, \r\nbut the drug trade has made Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean the most violent region in the world. That \r\nassessment must be done with lucidity, academic rigour \r\nand global responsibility. Taking a world perspective, \r\nwe must explore alternatives, specifically regulatory \r\nor market alternatives, to see what are and what are \r\nnot real options that would allow all nations, working \r\ntogether, to put an end to the scourge that claims tens of \r\nthousands of lives in our region. \r\nAs the United Nations considers and finds solutions \r\nto global problems that threaten the integrity, health \r\nand lives of millions around the world, as it deals with \r\nfamine, starvation in the Horn of Africa, epidemics such \r\nas the H1N1 virus in Mexico, and as it tackles climate \r\nchange, so it must also take action to stop the wave of \r\ndeath and suffering with which the drug trade blights \r\nthe lives of our people. I respectfully urge and exhort \r\nthe United Nations not only to take part in but to lead a \r\ndiscussion, devoid of prejudgments, that addresses the \r\nscale of the twenty-first century challenge, encouraging \r\nall of us to seek new and effective approaches to solving \r\nthis dire problem.\r\nMy tenure will end in a few months. I am proud \r\nthat Mexico can now count on an economy that is \r\nsolid, increasingly competitive and able to generate \r\n700,000 new formal jobs annually. I can say with \r\nsatisfaction that today Mexico is a stronger, more \r\nfair and more prosperous country, as our indices of \r\nhuman development for education, health, housing and \r\nemployment show.\r\n40 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nUnited Nations, the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nBritain takes that work very seriously. I am convinced \r\nthat we need to focus more than ever on the building \r\nblocks that take countries and people from poverty to \r\nprosperity. By those building blocks I mean the absence \r\nof conflict and corruption and the presence of property \r\nrights and the rule of law. We should never forget that \r\nfor many in the world the closest relative of poverty is \r\ninjustice. Development has never been just about aid \r\nor money, but I am proud that Britain is a country that \r\nkeeps its promises to the poorest in our world.\r\nA year ago I stood here and argued that the Arab \r\nSpring represented an unprecedented opportunity for \r\nadvancing peace, prosperity and security. One year \r\non, some believe that the Arab Spring is in danger of \r\nbecoming an Arab winter. They point to the riots on \r\nthe streets, to Syria’s descent into a bloody civil war, to \r\nfrustration at the lack of economic progress and to the \r\nemergence of newly elected Islamist-led Governments \r\nacross the region.\r\nBut I believe those people are in danger of drawing \r\nthe wrong conclusion. Today is not the time to turn back, \r\nbut to keep the faith and to redouble our support for open \r\nsocieties and for people’s demands for a job and a voice. \r\nYes, the path is challenging. But democracy is not, and \r\nnever has been, simply about holding an election. It is \r\nnot one person, one vote, once. Democracy is about \r\nestablishing the building blocks of true democracy: \r\nthe independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, \r\nwith the majority prepared to defend the rights of the \r\nminority; the freedom of the media; a proper place for \r\nthe army in society; and the development of effective \r\nState institutions, political parties and a wider civil \r\nsociety.\r\nI am not so naive as to believe that democracy \r\nalone has some magical healing power. I am a liberal \r\nConservative, not a neo-conservative. I respect each \r\ncountry’s different histories and traditions. I welcome \r\nthe steps taken in countries where reform is happening \r\nwith the consent of the people. I know that every \r\ncountry takes its own path, and that progress will \r\nsometimes be slow. Some countries have achieved \r\nstability and success based on tradition and consent.\r\nOthers have endured decades in which the institutions \r\nof civil society were deliberately destroyed, political \r\nparties banned, free media abolished and the rule of \r\nlaw twisted for the benefit of the few. We cannot expect \r\nthe damage of decades to be put right in a matter of \r\nmonths. But the drive for opportunity, justice and the \r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nI am proud to leave a Mexico that has close relations \r\nof friendship and cooperation with every nation; a \r\nMexico that is an active participant in building a world \r\nof peace, justice, security and development. We want \r\nfreedom for men and women; justice and respect for \r\nhuman rights in our societies; an environment that we \r\nrespect and that will allow our beloved planet Earth to \r\nlive forever; and democracy, without which there is no \r\nfreedom or development. And, of course, we seek and \r\ndesire peace on Earth, goodwill to men, and peace to all \r\nthose in this Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nMexican States for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, President of the \r\nUnited Mexican States, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by the Right Honourable Mr. David \r\nCameron, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency The Right Honourable \r\nMr. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Cameron (United Kingdom): I am proud that \r\nthis year Britain welcomed the world to the Olympic \r\nand Paralympic games and put on a great display, \r\nshowing that while we may have only the twenty-\r\nsecond-largest population in the world, we can roll out \r\none of its warmest welcomes.\r\nI am honoured, too, that in the coming year I have \r\nbeen asked to co-chair the high-level panel designed to \r\nhelp us build on one of the greatest achievements of the \r\n12-52201 41\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\ndefending national security. Britain is determined \r\nto work with our allies to do that. But democracy \r\nand open societies are not the problem. The fact is \r\nthat, for decades, too many were prepared to tolerate \r\ndictators like Al-Qadhafi and Al-Assad on the basis \r\nthat they would keep their people safe at home and \r\npromote stability in the region and the wider world. In \r\nfact, neither was true. Not only were theose dictators \r\nrepressing their people, ruling by control not by consent, \r\nplundering the national wealth, and denying people \r\ntheir basic rights and freedoms, they were funding \r\nterrorism overseas as well. Brutal dictatorships made \r\nthe region more dangerous not less; more dangerous \r\nbecause those regimes dealt with frustration at home \r\nby whipping up anger against their neighbours, against \r\nthe West, against Israel; and more dangerous, too, \r\nbecause people denied a job and a voice were given no \r\nalternative but a dead-end choice between dictatorship \r\nand extremism.\r\nWhat was heartening about the events of Tahrir \r\nSquare was that the Egyptian people found their voice \r\nand rejected that false choice. They withheld their \r\nconsent from a Government that had lost all legitimacy, \r\nand they chose instead the road to a more open and fair \r\nsociety. The road is not easy, but it is the right one. I \r\nbelieve it will make countries safer in the end.\r\nNext, there are those who say that, whatever may \r\nhave been achieved elsewhere, in Syria the Arab Spring \r\nhas unleashed a vortex of sectarian violence and hatred \r\nwith the potential to destroy the whole region. Syria \r\ndoes present some profound challenges. But those who \r\nlook at Syria today and blame the Arab Spring have got \r\nit the wrong way round. We cannot blame the people \r\nfor the behaviour of a brutal dictator. The responsibility \r\nlies with the brutal dictator himself.\r\nAl-Assad is today inflaming Syria’s sectarian \r\ntensions, just as his father did as far back as the slaughter \r\nin Hama 30 years ago. And not only in Syria; Al-Assad \r\nhas colluded with those in Iran who are set on dragging \r\nthe region into wider conflict. The only way out of \r\nSyria’s nightmare is to move forward towards political \r\ntransition and not to give up the cause of freedom. The \r\nfuture for Syria is a future without Al-Assad. It has to \r\nbe based on mutual consent, as was clearly agreed in \r\nthe International Conference on Syria held in Geneva \r\nin June. If anyone was in any doubt about the horrors \r\nthat Al-Assad has inflicted on his people, just look at \r\nthe evidence published this week by Save the Children: \r\nschools used as torture centres, children used for target \r\nrule of law and the hunger for a job and a voice are not \r\nresponsible for the problems in the region. In fact, quite \r\nthe opposite: the building blocks of democracy, fair \r\neconomies and open societies are part of the solution, \r\nnot part of the problem. We in the United Nations \r\nmust step up our efforts to support the people of those \r\ncountries as they build their own democratic future.\r\nLet me take the key arguments in turn. First, there \r\nare those who say there has been too little progress, \r\nthat the Arab Spring has produced few tangible \r\nimprovements in people’s lives. That is not right. Look \r\nat Libya since the fall of Al-Qadhafi. We have seen \r\nelections to create a new Congress, and now plans to \r\nintegrate armed groups into the national police and \r\narmy. None of that is to ignore the huge and sobering \r\nchallenges that remain.\r\nThe murder of Ambassador Chris Stevens was a \r\ndespicable act of terrorism. But the right response is \r\nto finish the work that Chris Stevens gave his life to. \r\nThat is what the vast majority of Libyans want, too, as \r\nwe saw so inspiringly in Benghazi last weekend, when \r\nthey took to the streets in the thousands, refusing to \r\nallow extremists to hijack their chance for democracy.\r\nThe Arab Spring has also brought progress in \r\nEgypt, where the democratically elected President \r\nhas asserted civilian control over the military; in \r\nYemen and Tunisia, where elections have brought new \r\nGovernments to power; and in Morocco, where there \r\nis a new Constitution and a Prime Minister appointed \r\non the basis of a popular vote for the first time. Even \r\nfurther afield, Somalia has also taken the first vital step \r\nforward by electing a new President. So there has been \r\nprogress. None of it would have come about without \r\npeople standing up last year and demanding change, \r\nor without the United Nations having the courage to \r\nrespond to those crises.\r\nSecondly, there is the argument that the removal of \r\ndictators has somehow started to unleash a new wave of \r\nviolence, extremism and instability. Some argue that in \r\na volatile region, only an authoritarian strong man can \r\nmaintain stability and security. Or even, some argue, \r\nthat recent events prove that democracy in the Middle \r\nEast brings terrorism, not security, and sectarian \r\nconflict, not peace. Again, I believe we should reject \r\nthat argument.\r\nI have no illusions about the danger that political \r\ntransition can be exploited by violent extremists. I \r\nunderstand the importance of protecting people and \r\n42 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nToday, I am announcing a new British task force to \r\nwork with the Egyptian Government to gather evidence, \r\ntrace assets, work to change European Union law and \r\npursue the legal cases that will return the stolen money \r\nto its rightful owners, the Egyptian people.\r\nFinally, perhaps most challenging of all for Western \r\ncountries like mine, is the argument that elections \r\nhave simply opened the door to Islamist parties whose \r\nvalues are incompatible with truly open societies. My \r\nresponse to this is clear. We should respect the outcome \r\nof elections. But we should not compromise on our \r\ndefinition of what makes an open society. We should \r\njudge Islamists by what they do. \r\nThe test is this. Will they entrust the rights of \r\ncitizenship to fellow countrymen and countrywomen \r\nwho do not share their specific political or religious \r\nviews? Do they accept that, unlike the dictators they \r\nreplaced, they should never pervert the democratic \r\nprocess to hold onto power if they lose the consent \r\nof the people they serve? Will they live up to their \r\ncommitments to protect the rule of law for all citizens, \r\nto defend the rights of Christians and minorities and \r\nto allow women a full role in society, in the economy \r\nand in politics? The truth is this: we cannot build \r\nstrong economies, we cannot build open societies and \r\nwe cannot have inclusive political systems if we lock \r\nout women. The eyes of the world today may be on the \r\nbrothers, but the future is as much in the hands of their \r\nmothers, their sisters and their daughters.\r\nHolding Islamists to account must also mean that \r\nif they attempt to undermine the stability of other \r\ncountries, encourage terrorism instead of peace or \r\npromote conflict instead of partnership, we will oppose \r\nthem. That is why Iran will continue to face the full \r\nforce of sanctions and scrutiny from the United Nations \r\nuntil it gives up its ambitions to spread a nuclear shadow \r\nover the world. It is also why we should not waver from \r\nour insistence that Hamas give up violence. Hamas must \r\nnot be allowed to dictate the way forward. Palestinians \r\nshould have the chance to fulfil the same aspirations for \r\na job and a voice as others in the region, and we support \r\ntheir right to have a State and a home. And Israelis \r\nshould be able to fulfil their own aspirations to live in \r\npeace and security with their neighbours.\r\nOf course there are challenges in working with \r\nGovernments that have different views and cultural \r\ntraditions. But there is a fundamental difference \r\nbetween Islam and extremism. Islam is a great religion \r\nobserved peacefully and devoutly by more than 1 billion \r\npractice. A 16-year-old Syrian called Wael who was \r\ndetained in a police station in Daraa said: “I have seen \r\nchildren slaughtered. No, I do not think I will ever be \r\nOK again...lf there was even 1 per cent of humanity in \r\nthe world, this would not happen”.\r\nThe blood of those young children is a terrible stain \r\non the reputation of the United Nations. In particular, \r\nit is a stain on those who have failed to stand up to \r\nthese atrocities and those who in some cases aided \r\nand abetted Al-Assad’s regime of terror. lf the United \r\nNations Charter is to have any value in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, we must now join together to support \r\na rapid political transition. At the same time, no one \r\nof conscience can turn a deaf ear to the voices of \r\nsuffering. Security Council members have a particular \r\nresponsibility to support the United Nations appeal for \r\nSyria. Britain, already the third biggest donor, is today \r\nannouncing a further $12 million in humanitarian \r\nsupport, including new support for UNICEF’s work \r\nto help Syrian children. We look to our international \r\npartners to do more as well.\r\nOf course, the Arab Spring has not removed \r\novernight the profound economic challenges that \r\nthese countries face. Too many countries face falling \r\ninvestment, rising food prices and bigger trade deficits. \r\nBut it is completely wrong to suggest that the Arab \r\nSpring has somehow created those economic problems. \r\nIt is a challenging time for the world economy as \r\na whole. There was never going to be an economic \r\ntransformation overnight, not least because far from \r\nbeing successful open-market-based economies, many \r\nof these countries were beset by vested interests and \r\ncorruption, with unaccountable institutions. That has, \r\none might say, created a double problem. Not just \r\nfragile economies, but worse, people were told they had \r\nexperienced free enterprise and open markets when \r\nthey had experienced nothing of the sort.\r\nSo we must help these countries unwind the legacy \r\nof endemic corruption, military expenditure they \r\ncannot afford, natural resources unfairly exploited; in \r\nshort, the mass kleptocracy that they suffered under for \r\ntoo long.\r\nWhile I am on the subject of stolen assets, we also \r\nhave a responsibility to help these countries get back \r\nthe stolen assets that are rightfully theirs, just as we \r\nhave returned billions of dollars of assets to Libya. It \r\nis simply not good enough that the Egyptian people \r\ncontinue to be denied those assets long after Mubarak \r\nhas gone.\r\n12-52201 43\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nMr. Al-Nasser for his dedication during his one-year \r\ntenure as President of the General Assembly, as well \r\nas to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić on \r\nhis assumption of the presidency of the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session. I would also like to pay my \r\ndeep respect to His Excellency Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his leadership.\r\nOne year ago, I started my speech on this rostrum by \r\nconveying our outpouring of appreciation to the world \r\n(see A/66/PV.19). It has been a year and a half since the \r\nGreat East Japan Earthquake in March 2011. The people \r\nin the affected areas are making strenuous efforts, with \r\nan unyielding spirit, to revive their hometowns. In order \r\nto respond to generous support from all over the world, \r\nwe, the Japanese, vowed before the souls of the victims \r\nto hand the lessons learned from the disaster down to \r\nsucceeding generations beyond our national borders.\r\nJapan will continue to share those lessons learned \r\nwith the world in order to build societies resilient to \r\nnatural disasters and to make concrete contributions to \r\nnuclear safety. The Fukushima Ministerial Conference \r\non Nuclear Safety, which is scheduled for the end of this \r\nyear, and is co-sponsored by the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency and the third World Conference on \r\nDisaster Reduction, which Japan plans to host in three \r\nyears, will also provide meaningful opportunities to \r\nshare those lessons.\r\nThe warning from nature brought on by the \r\nunprecedented earthquake and massive tsunami posed a \r\nmore fundamental question as to how we should sustain \r\nour civilization. From the moment of birth, human \r\nbeings transform their own wisdom into the power to \r\nsurvive harsh natural environments. Despite advanced \r\nscience and technology in modern civilization, however, \r\nthe forces of nature have reminded us how weak human \r\nbeings still are and that they have a fragile existence.\r\nThreats that may endanger human existence lie \r\nnot only in nature, but in advanced civilization itself. \r\nThere are a number of examples of those threats, \r\nsuch as environmental degradation, terrorism and the \r\nproliferation of nuclear weapons. What is required for \r\nthe human species to be able to keep its presence on \r\nEarth and continue to enjoy peace and prosperity? The \r\nanswer is clear: humans must become wiser. \r\nHumans have so far gained abundant knowledge. \r\nThe revolution in information and communication \r\ntechnology unfolding in front of us is further building \r\nup human knowledge on a geometric scale and at an \r\npeople. Islamist extremism is a warped political \r\nideology supported by a minority that seeks to hijack \r\nthat great religion, to gain respectability for its violent \r\nobjectives. It is vital that we make that distinction.\r\nIn Turkey, we see a Government with roots in \r\nIslamic values but with democratic politics, an open \r\neconomy and a responsible attitude to supporting \r\nchange in Libya, Syria and elsewhere in the region. \r\nI profoundly believe the same path is open to Egypt, \r\nTunisia and their neighbours. We must help them take \r\nit. Democracy and Islam can f lourish alongside one \r\nanother. Let us judge Governments not by their religion, \r\nbut by how they act and what they do. Let us engage with \r\nthe new democratic Governments in Egypt, Tunisia and \r\nLibya so their success can strengthen democracy, not \r\nundermine it.\r\nThere is no doubt that we are in the midst of \r\nprofound change and that many uncertainties lie \r\nahead. But the building blocks of democracy, fair \r\neconomies and open societies are part of the solution, \r\nnot the problem. Indeed, nothing in the last year has \r\nchanged my fundamental conviction. The Arab Spring \r\nrepresents a precious opportunity for people to realize \r\ntheir aspirations for a job, a voice and a stake in their \r\nfuture. We in the United Nations must do everything \r\nwe can to support them.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime Minister \r\nof Japan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Noda (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): First, I would like \r\nto express my sincere appreciation to His Excellency \r\n44 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nyears, Japan repeatedly procrastinated in policies and \r\nwas considered a symbol of a country that delayed \r\ndecisions. I pledged to change all that and staked my \r\npolitical life on implementing a comprehensive reform \r\nof our social security and taxation systems.\r\nThat reform is an ambitious package of policies \r\ndeveloped to support Japan’s social security system \r\nby maintaining a stable financial basis in the face \r\nof a rapidly aging population and by paving the way \r\nfor fiscal rehabilitation. It is a comprehensive reform \r\nprogramme that pursues both economic growth and \r\nfiscal reconstruction. Japan is taking a firm step \r\ntowards becoming a country that makes decisions \r\nwithout postponing difficult issues.\r\nAnother pearl of wisdom that humans acquired \r\ncame from the possibility of seeing the Earth we live on. \r\nI recently had the opportunity to communicate directly \r\nwith astronaut Akihiko Hoshide from my office while \r\nhe was orbiting the Earth in the International Space \r\nStation. At the time of our phone linkup, a female \r\nelementary school student who was in the office with \r\nus posed a riddle to the astronaut: “The Earth has air \r\nand gravity, but space does not,” she said. “What does \r\nspace have that the Earth does not?” “The view of \r\nthe Earth from outside it”, the astronaut replied. That \r\nconversation expressed in simple terms what I want to \r\nsay today.\r\nBecause we have attained the perspective of being \r\nable to see the Earth from outside, humankind as a \r\nwhole shares the sublime mission of protecting the \r\nglobal environment. We must always return to that \r\nperspective, reaching beyond borders and advancing \r\nconcrete measures to protect the Earth’s environment, \r\nwhich is the a basis of human survival. \r\nWith the aim of protecting the global environment, \r\na significant outcome for sustainable development \r\nwas achieved at the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20) in June 2012. Japan \r\nannounced its green future initiatives, proposing that \r\nwe explore sustainable growth in prosperity without \r\nthe supply-demand crunch of natural resources and \r\nenergy or damage to the global environment. Japan \r\nwill implement a low carbon and sound material-cycle \r\nsociety and take the lead in solving the common energy \r\nchallenges facing the world. To that end, we need more \r\ninnovation in energy efficiency and renewable energy. \r\nIn the light of the accident at Tokyo Electric Power \r\nCompany’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station on \r\n11 March 2011, and with the goal of achieving a society \r\nexponential speed. Human wisdom seems to have \r\nimproved dramatically. However, is that really true? At \r\nthe forefront of a long human history, we are living in \r\na period of complicated and violent change. Tensions \r\namong nations have risen in many parts of the world, \r\nwith more uncertain prospects for the future. The real \r\ntest for our survival in this unprecedented period is not \r\nhow much knowledge and information we have, but to \r\nlearn the true value of the numerous pearls of wisdom \r\nwe have accumulated.\r\nOne of the first such pearls of wisdom humans \r\ngained was the power to give adequate thought to not \r\nonly the present, but also the future. It is also the power \r\nto imagine, beyond our own benefits, the benefits to \r\nfuture generations and the power to act on their behalf. \r\nAgricultural society, which prompted human beings to \r\nadopt a new vista, was made possible through the long-\r\nterm perspective towards the future that human beings \r\nacquired when they waited for the harvest instead of \r\nthinking solely about immediate concerns.\r\nNow is the time for us to exert our wisdom and \r\nbuild a sustainable future for the sake of succeeding \r\ngenerations. Many countries have built up massive \r\nfiscal deficits, therefore fiscal soundness is now \r\na common challenge. If people living now do not \r\novercome deficits by cutting spending and striving to \r\nincrease revenues, future generations will be forced to \r\nrepay the deficits. \r\nThat structure amounts to nothing but current \r\ngenerations exploiting future generations.\r\nDemocracy has been historically proven to be \r\nthe best political system. However, we now face \r\nthe enormous challenge of learning whether or not \r\ndemocracy can maintain fairness between generations \r\nacross the globe. Under the system of parliamentary \r\ndemocracy, today’s representatives serve people living \r\nnow; there are no guarantees with respect to properly \r\nrepresenting the interests of future generations. The \r\ncurrent structure encourages politics that will burden \r\nsilent future generations by passing today’s problems \r\nonto them. \r\nWe are all responsible for the next generations. \r\nThis generation must successfully meet the challenges \r\nbefore us, and today’s political leaders must take \r\nresponsibility now for tomorrow. \r\nIn order to protect sound democratic societies, \r\nnow is the time to exert the power to think about the \r\nbenefits for future generations. Over the past 20-odd \r\n12-52201 45\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nweapons of mass destruction and the prevention of \r\nterrorism remain key contemporary issues. The nuclear \r\nand missile issues in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and Iran currently pose serious threats \r\nto the entire world. It is essential that all countries \r\ncoordinate at the United Nations and the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, including the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolutions urging both the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and Iran to \r\ntake concrete action. Japan, the only country that has \r\nexperienced the horror of nuclear devastation in war, \r\nwill continue to carry out its mission of seeking a world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe issue of the abductions by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea represents a violation of \r\nbasic human rights. That makes it a universal issue and \r\na matter of grave concern to the entire international \r\ncommunity. Japan is committed to continuing its utmost \r\nefforts to achieve the return of all victims at the earliest \r\npossible date, through strengthened coordination with \r\nother Member States. Japan intends to maintain its \r\nefforts to comprehensively resolve outstanding issues \r\nof concern, settle the unfortunate past and normalize \r\nrelations in accordance with the Japan-Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea Pyongyang Declaration. \r\nJapan continues to urge the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to take positive steps.\r\nHumans have done more than just act on their lust \r\nfor the use of force. We have also developed the skill \r\nto solve conflicts calmly through reason, which we \r\ncall the rule of law. Every State has a responsibility \r\nto safeguard peace, ensure the safety of its people \r\nand protect its territorial and maritime sovereignty. \r\nJapan will fulfil those responsibilities in accordance \r\nwith international law. Meanwhile, as globalization \r\nproceeds, the challenges confronting the international \r\ncommunity are growing increasingly complex, and \r\nrelations between nations can easily become tense. \r\nAt this critical juncture, we must establish the rule of \r\nlaw as a basis for global peace, stability and prosperity. \r\nBecause the rule of law is essential to preventing and \r\nresolving conflicts in a peaceful manner, and because \r\nit plays a critical role in the maintenance of stable and \r\npredictable societies, it must be further enhanced. Any \r\nattempt to impose a country’s ideology or claim by \r\nunilateral use of force or by threat of the use of force is \r\ninconsistent with the fundamental spirit of the United \r\nNations Charter and runs counter to human wisdom; it \r\nis thus absolutely unacceptable. It is important to try \r\nnot dependent on nuclear power by the 2030s, the \r\nGovernment of Japan will mobilize all possible policy \r\nresources to show the world a model that supports a \r\ngood balance between the shift towards green energy \r\nand economic growth. We will constantly review and \r\nre-examine our policies while carefully assessing the \r\noutlook for the future, including the international \r\nenergy situation. \r\nBeing ever more conscious of our one precious \r\nEarth, we must direct our caring attention to the \r\npreciousness of each life breathing on the planet. The \r\nJapan-led resolution on human security (resolution \r\n66/290), adopted on 10 September, can be a solid guide \r\nto visualizing development for the next generation from \r\nthe perspective of all people, including women and \r\nyoung people. In the light of the common understanding \r\nof human security stipulated in that resolution, Japan \r\nis determined to contribute to worldwide efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals and to \r\nwork towards the establishment of the next development \r\nframework.\r\nThe ideal of human security needs particular \r\nemphasis with respect to the African continent, which \r\nsteadily reveals greater development potential but \r\nstill suffers from many challenges, such as poverty, \r\nnatural disasters and conflicts. On the occasion of \r\nthe fifth Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Yokohama next June, \r\nJapan plans to discuss the measures the international \r\ncommunity and Africa should adopt and implement. \r\nWe must completely and successfully meet the \r\nchallenges that place our precious lives in danger. \r\nAfghanistan is making significant efforts \r\ntowards reconstruction after its prolonged experience \r\nof war. South Sudan is also moving forward in its \r\nnation-building efforts, and Myanmar has taken steady \r\nsteps towards democracy and reconciliation. Japan will \r\ndo its utmost to support and promote peacekeeping, \r\npeacebuilding and human security in each of those \r\nregions.\r\nA third pearl of wisdom that humans obtained \r\nwas the manner in which human beings settle disputes \r\nreasonably under rules. Human beings acquired \r\nlanguage and nurtured wisdom, but, even in modern \r\ntimes, they have failed to resist the temptation to solve \r\nconflicts by force. Despite two world wars and the two \r\ncalamities of atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima \r\nand Nagasaki, disarmament, the non-proliferation of \r\n46 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\ninternational judicial institutions play in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nAlthough the Middle East and Africa are still in \r\na tumultuous whirlwind, they are in fact moving in \r\nthe direction of establishing democracy. Japan will \r\ncontinue to support efforts at democratization and \r\nreform of every country. Moreover, we cannot overlook \r\nthe ongoing violence and suppression in Syria, or the \r\nserious violations of human rights with respect to \r\nthe rule of law. Japan strongly condemns the massive \r\nattacks in Syria that have involved tens of thousands \r\nof innocent citizens, journalists and aid workers, \r\nincluding Ms. Mika Yamamoto, a Japanese journalist. \r\nJapan intends to put more pressure on the Government \r\nof Syria, together with the international community, \r\nand to extend humanitarian assistance to the people of \r\nSyria.\r\nLet me emphasize that the international community \r\nmust secure the protection of civilians and the safety of \r\ndiplomats and workers of international organizations \r\nthrough the rule of law. Today, violence against that \r\nprinciple cannot be tolerated for any reason.\r\nThe concept of the rule of law is the foundation for \r\na stable and reliable society, making the movement of \r\npeoples and goods more vibrant and serving as a basis \r\nof prosperity. I believe that the rule of law can provide \r\nimportant infrastructure for order and prosperity for a \r\nnetwork of States centred in the Asia-Pacific region. \r\nJapan will vigorously contribute to rule-making efforts \r\nto expand trade and investment, build maritime order, \r\nincluding the safety of navigation, and create stability \r\nfor prosperity.\r\nThe rules needed by the international community \r\nare not simply for solving individual problems. Orderly \r\nrelations between nations or within international \r\norganizations require the rule of law, more specifically, \r\nenhanced global governance. Unless all nations fulfil \r\ntheir responsibilities in their respective capacities, we \r\ncannot overcome the various common challenges that \r\nthe world is facing. I hope in particular that emerging \r\ncountries will fulfil their responsibilities commensurate \r\nwith their respective national powers.\r\nAs part of such efforts, it is important that we \r\nengage in thorough discussions on how the United \r\nNations should develop in the future. We strongly \r\nsupport management reform at the United Nations. \r\nFurthermore, in order for the Security Council to be \r\nfully effective, it must be endowed with a legitimacy \r\nto further develop international law and ensure that \r\nit gets implemented more effectively. I strongly call \r\nfor leaders to strengthen the rule of law so as to leave \r\nfuture generations with a more peaceful and stable \r\ninternational community.\r\nWe are currently witnessing the settlement of \r\nconflicts between nations on the basis of international \r\nlaw. A typical example is the dispute settlement process \r\nof the World Trade Organization, a mechanism that has \r\nmade it possible for States to solve trade disputes with \r\nthe common language of law, not by force, in a panel or \r\nappellate body.\r\nJapan has always valued the rule of law and has \r\ncontributed to strengthening it. Since joining the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Japan has consistently \r\nrecognized the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory \r\nand has taken the lead in practicing the rule of law. \r\nJapan is leading the world in its contributions \r\nof personnel and financing to international judicial \r\ninstitutions. In addition to having served at the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Japanese judges have \r\nalso served at the International Tribunal for the Law of \r\nthe Sea, the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the \r\nExtraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia. \r\nFurthermore, Japan has provided the largest financial \r\nsupport of any country for the latter three institutions. \r\nJapan requests each country to kindly offer financial \r\nsupport to the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts \r\nof Cambodia, which is facing a severe financial crisis \r\nat the moment.\r\nSupporting the United Nations in promoting the rule \r\nof law continues to be a great challenge. Once again, I \r\ncall for nations to work in cooperation with the United \r\nNations to recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, as Japan did, and \r\nfor non-member countries of the ICC and the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea to join at an \r\nearly date.\r\nThere are still a number of territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes in many parts of the world. It is the philosophy \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and a principle \r\nshared by the international community as a whole \r\nthat disputes should be settled in a peaceful manner \r\non the basis of international law. In all circumstances, \r\nJapan is determined to comply with that principle and \r\nseek peaceful solutions based on international law. \r\nThe world should pay greater attention to the role the \r\n12-52201 47\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nam thinking especially of the positive developments in \r\nMyanmar and Somalia and of the young democracies \r\nthroughout the world, such as Timor-Leste. \r\nBut it is, of course, the transformations under way \r\nin the Arab world that are foremost in my mind today.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWhen these historic changes swept through the \r\nArab world, they stirred a mixture of deep emotions \r\nin those watching, both within the region and beyond. \r\nThere was fear of bloodshed, regional instability and \r\nof a rise of extremism, and uncertainty about what \r\nwas yet to come. But, overwhelmingly, the world \r\nlooked on with solidarity, understanding and hope. \r\nWe in Europe — geographically so close and with our \r\nsocieties so deeply involved with those in the countries \r\nexperiencing these upheavals — were also acutely \r\naware that the changes and the risks and opportunities \r\nthat lay ahead would directly affect us as neighbours.\r\nOf course, expectations were high. It was tempting \r\nto read the events in Tunis or Cairo as the opening pages \r\nof a fairy tale. But this is the book of history. It contains \r\ndark pages too, some of them tragically being written \r\nat this very moment. We are bound by a simple truth: \r\nachieving lasting change takes time. New democratic \r\ninstitutions do not run smoothly as if by magic. Turning \r\neconomies around and creating jobs for millions of \r\nyoung men and women are not things that happen at the \r\nwave of a wand. Deep tensions do not suddenly dissolve \r\nonce a dictator has gone.\r\nThe long path of transition lies ahead. There will \r\nundoubtedly be disappointments along the way. There \r\nwill be wrong turns, hurdles and setbacks. But I firmly \r\nbelieve that despite the difficulties, the momentum is \r\nheading in the right direction and there is no going \r\nback. Whatever the future brings, the Arab Spring will \r\nremain a turning point. The movement is irreversible. \r\nOnce the voices of the people have been set free — an \r\nunforgettable experience for all those who had never \r\nbeen heard before — those voices cannot be silenced.\r\nIt is the responsibility of each country to chart its \r\nown course and to do justice to the aspirations of its \r\npeople. The European Union is committed to staying by \r\ntheir side every step along the way. We are in it for the \r\nlong run. I want to reaffirm that we still believe in the \r\nmessage of the Arab Spring.\r\nEuropeans are well placed to recognize that \r\npolitical change is not painless and does not happen \r\nthat reflects the realities of the world today. Japan \r\nis ready to take on greater responsibility in the \r\ninternational community. Now is the time to accelerate \r\nthe stalled process on Security Council reform and to \r\nstart genuine negotiations.\r\nSo far I have mentioned three pearls of wisdom \r\nnecessary for human beings to live sustainable lives \r\nin the future, and I have tried to convey Japan’s \r\ncontribution in each. It is my belief that human beings \r\nwill continue to adapt to a complex world and become \r\nwiser. I believe they will give adequate consideration \r\nto future generations and solve disputes calmly through \r\nreason based on rules generated from the perspective of \r\nlooking at the Earth from the outside.\r\nLet us take charge of our responsibilities for \r\ntomorrow together. The lofty task for us living now is \r\nto carry out politics while imagining the benefits for \r\nfuture generations and gather all our wisdom to set a \r\ncourse towards the survival of human beings.\r\nI should like to conclude my remarks by pledging \r\nto the entire General Assembly that Japan will stand at \r\nthe forefront of shaping the future of human history for \r\npeaceful and aff luent societies.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Yoshihiko Noda, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, President \r\nof the European Council \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by His Excellency Mr. Herman Van \r\nRompuy, President of the European Council. \r\nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council, and inviting him to \r\nmake a statement. \r\nMr. Van Rompuy (European Council) (spoke in \r\nFrench): The advance of democracy has taken place in \r\nsuccessive waves since the United Nations was created. \r\nThat advance has experienced a new acceleration, \r\nwhich we all can all welcome. Without underestimating \r\nthe difficulties and problems encountered elsewhere, I \r\n48 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nTolerance is the ability to withstand criticism, to \r\noffer dialogue, to refrain from violence. As such, it \r\nshows self-confidence. At the same time, respect for \r\nthe faith and beliefs of others is a key value for living \r\ntogether. Tolerance and respect acquire their full \r\nmeaning in an open society that protects freedom of \r\nexpression. Each and every one of us in this Hall has a \r\nresponsibility to defend and promote tolerance in and \r\nbetween our countries, as well as respect. Violence \r\nand killing, such as that of United States Ambassador \r\nChristopher Stevens, can never be justified, regardless \r\nof their motivations.\r\nToday I join the voice of Europe to those who \r\nhave spoken to deplore the civil war raging in Syria. \r\nConfronted with the massacre of tens of thousands of \r\npeople, the world has united in horror and condemnation, \r\nbut — we must be frank — we have not yet been able to \r\nstop the brutal violence. Of course Europe and others \r\nprovide humanitarian support to refugees. Of course \r\nwe support individuals who risk their lives collecting \r\nevidence of the massacres. Of course our diplomats \r\nin Damascus do their utmost to support the United \r\nNations efforts for a peaceful solution. But we will \r\nremain powerless unless the international community \r\nunites in a common determination to end this senseless \r\nviolence, which threatens to wreak havoc in the whole \r\nregion.\r\nI should like to commend the excellent work and \r\nstrong commitment of the Secretary-General, as well as \r\nthat of Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi, to find \r\na solution to overcome this tragedy. \r\nI also welcome the initiatives aimed at bringing \r\ntogether the main regional players in a coherent \r\ninternational approach. Earlier this year, European \r\nleaders called upon all members of the Security Council \r\nto work together in an effort to stop the violence. Today \r\nthat call is even more urgent.\r\nThe country needs to move quickly towards a \r\nSyrian-led political transition that meets the democratic \r\naspirations of the Syrian people, while fully respecting \r\nthe civil and human rights of minorities. It is the only \r\nway out. Those responsible for the repression have no \r\nplace in determining the future of Syria and must step \r\naside. The longer that the conflict continues, the more \r\nradicalized people will become, the more blood will \r\nneedlessly be shed, and the longer it will take for the \r\nwounds to heal.\r\novernight. We know about long transitions. When \r\nEuropean integration first started, within my lifetime, \r\na majority of the countries that are now members \r\nwere not yet democracies. For us, a transition of such \r\nmagnitude should not be judged by its speed but by its \r\ndirection and by progress achieved through countless \r\nsteps forward.\r\nThe starting point is free and fair elections. We \r\ntherefore commend the achievements of Tunisia, Libya, \r\nEgypt and other countries in successfully organizing \r\ndemocratic elections, in which many citizens voted \r\nfreely for the very first time in their lives — elections \r\nfor which we were happy to lend expertise to national \r\nand local authorities.\r\nIn order to ultimately bring jobs, social justice and \r\nfreedom of expression to all, this gigantic democratic \r\nprocess will have to overcome, every single day, \r\nthe obstacles of corruption, red tape and economic \r\nprivileges and maintain the political determination to \r\nensure inclusiveness. It is an important effort, to which \r\nmany parties are contributing. For our part, across the \r\nregion we offer advice to entrepreneurs and officials, \r\nhelp train judges and police and support journalists and \r\ncivil society groups.\r\nIn our experience, societies are stronger when \r\nwomen are fully able to take part in the political and \r\neconomic lives of their countries, when their voices \r\nare heard and their choices respected. There may be \r\ntemptations, once power is gained, to refuse to grant to \r\nsome the rights that until recently were withheld from \r\nall. But a democracy can f lourish only when it gives all \r\nits people — whatever their gender, religion, language \r\nor ethnic identity — an equal say and equal rights, \r\nguaranteed in law and in practice.\r\nFinally, neighbours can achieve more when they \r\nwork together. That is why we share experience from \r\nour own European union on issues such as connecting \r\nenergy networks and removing regional obstacles to \r\ntrade.\r\nBringing together and reconciling former enemies \r\nin a common desire for peace, democracy and \r\nprosperity has been one of the European Union’s great \r\nachievements. Respect, tolerance and non-violence \r\nare the core values, without which living together \r\nharmoniously is not possible. These are fragile values; \r\nsustaining them requires constant attention, especially \r\nin a global digital world in which messages of all kinds \r\ncan spread faster than ever and can easily be exploited.\r\n12-52201 49\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nto become more competitive and create jobs for the \r\nfuture. We have started building a banking union to \r\nbetter manage and contain financial sector risk; and in \r\nthe coming months we will be defining the perspectives \r\non where we are headed and where we want our \r\neconomic and monetary union to be in 10 years’ time.\r\nWe have already come a long way, and today we see \r\nthe first results of that collective endeavour. Although \r\nthere is still some way to go, I am confident that those \r\nefforts will meet with success and that Europe will \r\nemerge from the experience stronger, economically and \r\npolitically.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThat is what I have come before the Assembly to \r\nsay. In our view as Europeans, managing the financial \r\ncrisis not only concerns monetary operations and \r\nbalancing budgets. What is at stake is the very future \r\nof our European project. The project was born in order \r\nto overcome the wars and dictatorships that had long \r\nhaunted our continent. For 60 years, our union has \r\nallowed us to end nationalist hatred between countries \r\nand to establish a unified continent in peace that seeks \r\nsocial justice and prosperity, which requires daily \r\nefforts to maintain those values and establish them \r\nmore firmly. Gains can always be forfeited. At the \r\nglobal level, it is the task of the General Assembly to \r\nstrive tirelessly to pursue the same goals that we all \r\nshare, and to clear the way forward towards greater \r\nharmony and greater progress throughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the European \r\nCouncil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Herman van Rompuy, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Jaber \r\nAl Mubarak Al Hamad Al Sabah, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State of \r\nKuwait.\r\nSheikh Jaber Al Mubarak Al Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al Mubarak \r\nAl Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the State \r\nThe security situation remains complex and fragile \r\nin many parts of the world. The events of the Arab Spring \r\nshould not distract us from the urgent task of achieving \r\npeace in the Middle East — quite the contrary. There \r\nare also other pressing issues, including addressing \r\ninstability and the humanitarian situation in the Sahel \r\nregion; bringing peace and stability to the Great Lakes \r\nregion; convincing the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons and missile \r\nprogrammes; and finding a negotiated solution to the \r\nIranian nuclear issue, an issue to which the European \r\nUnion is directly committed.\r\nWe must address all of those concerns, with the \r\nknowldege that lasting solutions require political will \r\nfrom the countries involved. In the same spirit, it is \r\nimportant that tensions in the East and South-East \r\nAsian maritime areas subside and that disputes be \r\nsettled peacefully in a spirit of cooperation based on \r\nrespect for international law.\r\nThere are many global challenges that we must \r\ntackle together. But without multilateral cooperation on \r\nissues ranging from fighting climate change to reducing \r\npoverty around the world, we will not succeed. That \r\nis why the European Union fully supports a stronger, \r\nmore effective and more efficient United Nations.\r\nCitizens in all our countries want jobs. In that regard \r\nas well, global cooperation is indispensable and is the \r\nbest way to ensure the world’s economic recovery. Our \r\neconomies have become completely interdependent. No \r\ncountry can solve its issues alone; no country can afford \r\nto ignore the problems of others. Do we know that? Yes. \r\nDo we act upon that knowledge? Not often enough.\r\nIn 2008, at the start of the global financial crisis, \r\nthere was a brief moment of global awareness, a sense \r\nof urgency that led to new forums, joint pledges and \r\ncoordinated action. Today, although the crisis is still \r\nwith us, our resolve in the current period after the failure \r\nof Lehman Brothers seems to have waned and must be \r\nrevived. All major economies need to play their part in \r\nputting the world economy back on the path of growth. \r\nGlobal growth depends on structural reforms in each \r\nof our countries and on reducing the macroeconomic \r\nimbalances among them.\r\nIn Europe we are doing our part of that work. \r\nNo effort has been spared to overcome the current \r\ndifficulties in the eurozone. We have been setting up \r\nstronger firewalls to guarantee the stability of our \r\ncommon currency, and we are reforming our economies \r\n50 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nThere have been two decades of discussion and \r\nin-depth negotiation on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, focused mainly on the expansion of the \r\nCouncil’s membership, including how many members \r\nare needed to achieve an equitable degree of \r\nrepresentation, and on improving its working methods. \r\nThe State of Kuwait reaffirms the need to reform \r\nthe Security Council to reflect the new international \r\nreality and to ensure that Arab and Islamic States are \r\nrepresented fairly, in conformity with their size, their \r\ncontributions and their role in advancing the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI should like to quote from the statement delivered \r\nby His Highness the Amir of the State of Kuwait at the \r\nSummit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation \r\nheld in the Holy City of Mecca on 13 August: \r\n“The killing and destruction that we witness on a \r\ndaily basis in sisterly Syria evokes grief and pain. \r\nSadly, a child who has lost his parents and his home, \r\na mother mourning her nearest and dearest, cities \r\nthat have turned into ghost towns owing to the \r\nhorrific destruction that has befallen them — these \r\nhave become all too familiar sights. Such scenes \r\nredouble our responsibilities before the Almighty \r\nas well as before all our peoples. I call upon us to \r\nmove without delay to put an end to this bloody \r\ntragedy”.\r\nWe would like to congratulate Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \r\nJoint Special Representative of the United Nations and \r\nthe League of Arab States for Syria, on his appointment. \r\nKuwait supports him in his undertaking and his \r\ndetermination to continue the work of his predecessor, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, which yielded the six-point plan that \r\nwould have resulted in a peaceful resolution of the crisis, \r\nhad it been actively considered. We reaffirm Kuwait’s \r\ncommitment to international efforts to reach a political \r\nsolution that fulfils the demands and aspirations of \r\nthe Syrian people. We would also like to redouble our \r\nefforts with the international community, to which \r\nwe appeal for additional humanitarian assistance to \r\nalleviate the pain and suffering of the Syrian people, \r\nboth within and outside Syria.\r\nThis November, the State of Kuwait will celebrate \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of its \r\nConstitution, which is regarded as the culmination \r\nof four centuries of political progress and growth.In \r\nconsolidation the development of relations between ruler \r\nand ruled towards the effective practice of democracy, \r\nof Kuwait, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, in the name of the Government and \r\nthe people of the State of Kuwait, I have the pleasure of \r\nextending to the President and to his fraternal country, \r\nSerbia, our sincerest congratulations on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession. I wish him every success in his endeavours. \r\nWe would also like to commend the efforts of His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser \r\non his successful presidency of the previous session. \r\nI would be remiss if I did not pay tribute to His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ncontinued efforts in leading the Organization and \r\nspreading its noble message on the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in achieving the priorities he has set for \r\nhis second term, in the political, economic and \r\nhumanitarian fields.\r\nOn our part, we reaffirm the continued cooperation \r\nof the State of Kuwait and its full commitment \r\nto support the efforts of the United Nations in its \r\nendeavours to achieve the aims and purposes of the \r\nCharter, as well as to strengthen and activate its role in \r\nfollowing up the outcomes agreed upon in international \r\nforums. In that context, the State of Kuwait emphasizes \r\nthe need for a thorough preparation of the 2012 \r\nconference on the establishment of a Middle East zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, as agreed in the Final Document of the \r\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Numerous \r\nchallenges face the Organization as it nears its seventh \r\ndecade. From its inception, the United Nations and all \r\nof its organs and agencies have worked to contain and \r\nresolve many crises and to meet political, humanitarian \r\nand economic challenges. However, in this era of \r\nglobalization and the information revolution, poor \r\ncoordination, f laws in joint actions and the failure of \r\nsome States to fulfil their obligations have prevented \r\nthe United Nations from reaching conclusive solutions. \r\nTherefore, in fulfilment of the aspirations of the \r\npeoples we represent, it is important for us to work on \r\nreforming, developing and refining the United Nations, \r\nas well as providing the firm political will to enhance \r\nits performance and to face up to new challenges.\r\n12-52201 51\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\ndispelling doubts surrounding its goals and purposes, \r\nthereby averting further crises and conflicts, which, \r\nunfortunately, have become associated with this vital \r\nregion of the world. We hope that the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran will be a positive and active party in the region, \r\nexercising its role in accordance with the basic rules \r\nand principles of mutual respect and common interests, \r\nthereby creating a normal environment of cooperation \r\nthat will serve the peoples of the region, free from \r\ninterference in their internal affairs. \r\nAlong the same lines, we also hope that the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran will cooperate and respond to the \r\ninitiatives intended to resolve the conflict over the \r\nthree occupied Emirati islands, in conformity with the \r\nprinciples and norms of international law.\r\nThe continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian \r\nterritories testifies to the inability of the international \r\ncommunity to come up with solutions that will put \r\nan end to the plight of the Palestinian people. The \r\nIsraeli Government, in gross violation of international \r\nconventions and norms, persists in its intransigence and \r\nillegal policies through its expansion of settlements in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, as well as through its \r\nblockade of the Gaza Strip. Those actions do not help \r\nthe cause of the just and lasting peace we desire in the \r\nMiddle East. We therefore demand that the international \r\ncommunity, represented by the Security Council, put \r\npressure on Israel and compel it to implement the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, the principle of \r\nland for peace, the Quartet’s road map and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, so as to guarantee the establishment of \r\nthe Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nand the total Israeli withdrawal from all Arab territories \r\noccupied since 4 June 1967.\r\nSome States face special and chronic challenges that \r\nhave led to their marginalization on the international \r\nscene for many long years. They are at risk of becoming \r\nfailed States if the international community does not \r\nredouble its efforts to help them get back on their \r\nfeet and start them on a path that will enable them to \r\nfunction normally and to become effective participants \r\nin today’s world.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the \r\ndecisions and steps taken by President Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour and the Yemeni Government \r\nto implement the Gulf Cooperation Council’s initiative \r\nand its implementation mechanism, and to support \r\nfinalization of the Initiative’s remaining items. We \r\nalso reaffirm our confidence that Yemen, under an \r\nthe Constitution is considered the beacon that guides \r\nthe State of Kuwait, its Government and people towards \r\na dignified life by establishing rights and duties, \r\nguaranteeing basic freedoms, outlining general policies \r\nand regulating foreign relations without interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of other States. The Constitution \r\nserves as an interpretation of Kuwait’s political vision, \r\nbased on its belief in, and pursuit of, peace, together \r\nwith its determination to develop and foster its relations \r\nwith neighbouring countries, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples of mutual respect and common interests.\r\nMr. Roman-Morey (Peru), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nRelations between Kuwait and Iraq have \r\nprogressed very positively, and the State of Kuwait \r\nregards the painful wound of invasion as healed. The \r\nparticipation of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad \r\nAl-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait, \r\nin the Arab Summit held in Baghdad in March did \r\nmuch to bring about a qualitative leap forward in our \r\nbilateral relations. Moreover, the visit to Kuwait by \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Nuri Kamel al-Maliki, Prime \r\nMinister of Iraq, created an atmosphere of trust and \r\ndetermination that has helped to turn the page with \r\nrespect to commitments and relations between our two \r\ncountries. Subsequently, a second round of meetings \r\nof the Joint Kuwait-Iraq Ministerial Committee was \r\nconvened in Baghdad in April, ref lecting the desire of \r\nboth sides to turn away from the past.\r\nImportant understandings reflecting the interests \r\nof the our countries have been reached on some \r\nof the outstanding bilateral issues. There has been \r\nagreement also on a work programme to accelerate \r\nIraq’s implementation of its remaining international \r\nobligations, in accordance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, whereupon Iraq will have fulfilled \r\nits obligations under Chapter VII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and will be able to exercise its natural \r\nrole regionally and internationally. That development \r\nwill help to improve the climate for achieving regional \r\nsecurity and peace, which are prerequisites for the \r\nprosperity and progress of a region that has suffered \r\nfrom wars and devastating conflicts for the past three \r\ndecades.\r\nOn the regional level, the State of Kuwait renews \r\nits call to the friendly Islamic Republic of Iran to take \r\ndeliberate and effective steps towards cooperating \r\nwith international efforts aim at reaching a political \r\nsettlement with regard to its nuclear programme and at \r\n52 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nWe urge the Assembly to give serious consideration \r\nat this session to the Amir’s proposal and adopt a \r\nresolution to implement it for the benefit of the whole \r\nof humankind and to promote social peace and security \r\namong nations.\r\nOur world faces numerous environmental, economic, \r\nsocial and security issues. Those issues are intertwined \r\nand complex and the source of many challenges to \r\nStates and peoples, particularly in developing and least-\r\ndeveloped countries. The consequences of the global \r\nfinancial crisis, the rise in basic commodity prices, the \r\nclear negative impact of climate change, the growing \r\nfrequency of natural disasters and the intensification \r\nof terrorism have put the focus on the ugly face of \r\npoverty and hunger, as well as the spread of epidemics \r\nand communicable and dangerous diseases. Despite the \r\nnotable accomplishments of many States in their efforts \r\nto reach the Millennium Development Goals, we have \r\nnot yet achieved all the objectives we set ourselves as \r\na whole. It is essential, therefore, that we pursue our \r\njoint efforts to limit the effects of the challenges we \r\nface and contain them in order to ensure our ultimate \r\nfull attainment of these noble goals.\r\nWhile the State of Kuwait is itself considered a \r\ndeveloping country, since gaining independence in \r\n1961 it has embarked on a steady course in which we \r\nattach great importance to helping developing and least-\r\ndeveloped countries. We do this through numerous \r\nmechanisms and initiatives, including the Kuwait \r\nFund for Arab Economic Development, which gives \r\ndevelopment aid to Arab, Asian and African countries, \r\nas well as countries in Central and Latin America, \r\nbased on our belief in the importance of international \r\ncooperation and helping nations and peoples in need.\r\nBased on our desire to increase joint regional and \r\ninternational activities and enhance their effectiveness, \r\nand in recognition of the fact that various forums held \r\naround the world have become major channels for \r\nexamining regional and economic cooperation and \r\nmaximizing the benefits derived from sharing States’ \r\nsuccessful experiences, in October last year Kuwait \r\nhosted the most recent meeting of the Asia Cooperation \r\nDialogue (ACD), held annually for the past 10 years \r\nat the level of Foreign Minister of the participating \r\ncountries. Kuwait also called for the convening of the \r\nfirst Summit of the ACD countries, to be held in Kuwait \r\non 15 and 16 October. We hope that this meeting will \r\ngive leaders of Asian States the opportunity to discuss \r\nevery topic of importance in the areas of economic, \r\nelected President and a Government of national unity, \r\nis capable of achieving the development and progress in \r\nvarious areas that the fraternal Yemeni people aspire to. \r\nWe also reaffirm our continued backing and support for \r\nthe Yemeni Republic’s efforts to ensure political and \r\neconomic stability.\r\nWe would also like to congratulate the \r\nfraternal Republic of Somalia on the great historic \r\naccomplishment represented by its ratification of a \r\nprovisional constitution and the election of Mr. Hassan \r\nSheikh Mohamud as President. We hope that these \r\npositive developments will help lift Somalia from a \r\nstate of conflict and national chaos to one governed \r\nby constitutional institutions, thus launching a \r\nnew political future that will see the ambitions and \r\naspirations of the fraternal Somali people fulfilled.\r\nWe commend the positive reaction of the United \r\nNations and the international community to the bloody \r\nevents that the Muslim minority in Myanmar has been \r\nsubjected to, and hope that those efforts will help to \r\nstop the violence, preserve people’s legitimate rights \r\nand enable peace to prevail.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe peoples and Governments of Islamic countries \r\nhave expressed their strong condemnation and outrage \r\nover the film denigrating the Prophet Muhammad, \r\nGod’s blessing and peace be upon him, and the Islamic \r\nfaith and its benevolent values. That irresponsible and \r\nimpudent act has ignited extreme rage among Muslim \r\npeoples and communities all over the world, including \r\nacts of violence, destruction, and killings in some \r\ncountries. While the State of Kuwait has denounced \r\nthe film in the strongest possible terms, as well as the \r\nsubsequent killing and destruction, which are very far \r\nfrom the spirit and essence of Islam, in this context I \r\nwould like to recall what His Highness Sheikh Sabah \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of \r\nKuwait, proposed at the General Assembly’s high-\r\nlevel meeting on the culture of peace, held on 12 and \r\n13 November 2008:\r\n“The best outcome to our well-intended \r\ngathering in this Hall would be a joint international \r\ncommitment to respect all religions and to avoid \r\ndamaging, interfering with or ridiculing their \r\nsymbols, while endeavouring to deter such acts and \r\nthose who advocate them.” (A/63/PV.46, p. 10) \r\n12-52201 53\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nIn 2011, financial markets showed serious new \r\nsigns of tension, due primarily to the deterioration of \r\npublic finances. What we have been experiencing is \r\nnot a recurrent cyclical imbalance. In the case of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU), it is the deepest and worst crisis \r\nin its history.\r\nOther crises threatened the European project in the \r\npast, but each time Europeans found a way to continue \r\ndown the path on which they embarked upon more \r\nthan 50 years ago. In his memoirs, Jean Monnet noted \r\nthat Europe would be built through crises. Indeed, it \r\nis by solving those crises that Europeans have realized \r\nhow closely integrated their interests are and how \r\ninterdependent their economies. Today, the world has \r\nlearned how essential a viable Europe is to tackling \r\nglobal economic and security challenges, and how \r\nimportant the euro area is to the recovery of the global \r\neconomy. Today it is clear that “more Europe” is in the \r\ngeneral interest, and not just that of Europeans.\r\nWe cannot overlook the importance of the measures \r\nbeing taken at the EU level to strengthen governance and \r\nfiscal integration, as was underlined by President Van \r\nRompuy. It is also essential that European Governments \r\ndeliver at the national level. Italy will continue to do \r\nits part to further strengthen fiscal sustainability and \r\nenhance potential growth.\r\nHistoric changes are taking place in the \r\nMediterranean region. Italy has stood by the Arab \r\npeoples in their quest for justice and democracy. In the \r\npast months, we have engaged with the new leaders \r\nof those nations. I found in them a deep commitment \r\nthat inspires hope. Both bilaterally and through the \r\nEuropean Union, we are lending concrete support to \r\ntheir new Governments to assist their recovery, set \r\nmutually beneficial trade policies and foster inclusive \r\neconomic development, thereby promoting stability \r\nthroughout the region.\r\nThere is also an element of self-interest in that \r\npursuit. Instability around the Mediterranean impacts \r\nour own security. Conflicts and social unrest on the \r\nsouthern shore spill over to our own shores. Terrorism \r\nfinds new avenues to reach Europe. Trafficking in \r\nhuman beings has destabilizing effects on the countries \r\nof destination and often results tragedies at sea, which \r\nwe can no longer accept. The situation in the Sahel is of \r\ngrave concern and a top priority for Italy. It is a volatile \r\nmix of fragile institutions and rampant organized \r\ncrime and terrorist groups. We cannot let the situation \r\ndeteriorate any further. Italy, for one, will make its \r\nenvironmental and humanitarian affairs. In March \r\n2013 Kuwait will also host the Arab-African Summit, \r\nwhich we hope will deepen Arab-African cooperation \r\nand open new horizons to serve stability, development \r\nand cooperation among the peoples of these two groups \r\nof countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I affirm the State of Kuwait’s \r\nallegiance to the multilateral international system and \r\nto the principles and purposes of the United Nations \r\nCharter. We also believe in the necessity for all States \r\nto abide by the obligations and responsibilities they \r\nhave committed to in international agreements and \r\nconferences, thus contributing to finding just and fair \r\nsolutions to global threats and challenges.\r\nThe State of Kuwait believes that dialogue and the \r\npromotion of a culture of tolerance, moderation and \r\nrejection of violence and extremism are ideal means \r\nfor advancing the values of equality and justice, in \r\norder to reach our higher goal — the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the State of \r\nKuwait for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al Mubarak Al Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mario Monti, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Italy\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Mario Monti, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nItaly, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Monti (Italy): I wish to warmly congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at this session. Rest assured \r\nthat you have Italy’s full support as you assume your \r\ncrucial responsibilities in the service of international \r\npeace and cooperation.\r\nEvery day and everywhere, people strive to \r\novercome fear, achieve justice and persevere through \r\nhardship and uncertainty to protect their families \r\nand livelihoods and to ensure a better future for their \r\nchildren. Governments strive to achieve and preserve \r\npeace, justice and prosperity in a world gripped by \r\npolitical tensions, civil wars and a severe economic and \r\nfinancial crisis.\r\n54 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. Italy advocates \r\nmore effective arms control regimes, and looks forward \r\nto concrete nuclear disarmament measures as proposed \r\nin President Obama’s Prague appeal.\r\nRespect for the rule of law is the basic condition for \r\npromoting human rights and maintaining international \r\npeace and security. In that context, Mr. President, I \r\nwelcome your proposal of “Bringing about adjustment \r\nor settlement of international disputes or situations \r\nby peaceful means” as the overarching theme for this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. \r\nI am also pleased to announce that Italy is now \r\nready to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in accordance with \r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute. This \r\nis a defining moment for the International Court of \r\nJustice and for international jurisdictions in general, \r\nsince they are the key institutions for interpreting \r\ninternational law and guaranteeing global compliance \r\nwith its provisions. More and more, effective actions to \r\nassure international order and security demand respect \r\nfor international law. \r\nThe same holds true for actions to counter new \r\nthreats, such as piracy, which is particularly troubling \r\ngiven its impact on the world economy and on the lives \r\nof seafarers. International efforts to protect sea lanes \r\nand fight piracy can be effective only if all nations \r\ncooperate in good faith, according to the established \r\nrules of international customary law and United Nations \r\nconventions, including those protecting the jurisdiction \r\nof the f lag State in international waters.\r\nThe Organization can expect no less from each \r\nMember State, and especially from those Members that \r\naim to have a decisive influence on the rules of global \r\ngovernance. Any erosion of the sending State’s exclusive \r\njurisdiction over servicemen on official duty would \r\njeopardize the status of our agents on international \r\nmissions. Consequently, it would also undermine the \r\nsustainability of United Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nBy the same token, we must not tolerate any breach \r\nof diplomatic missions, whose inviolability must be \r\nrespected. We firmly condemn any proposition that \r\nviolence is an acceptable response to speech.\r\nTransnational organized crime also requires a \r\ncollective response grounded in the rule of law and \r\nthe principle of shared responsibility. With the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, Italy has actively \r\ncontributed to, and co-financed with Colombia, a \r\ncontribution jointly with our partners and the States of \r\nthe region.\r\nThe ultimate goals of peace and cooperation will \r\nbe achieved only if all the countries concerned work \r\ntogether on the basis of mutual respect and a shared \r\nsense of purpose. A culture of dialogue must prevail \r\nover confrontation. Extremism and intolerance must be \r\nisolated and rejected. Rights, dignity and opportunities \r\nmust be offered to every component and member of our \r\nsocieties, especially minorities and women.\r\nItaly is fully committed to implementing such a \r\nvision. For us, protecting and promoting human rights \r\nis a long-standing domestic commitment as well as a \r\nfundamental pillar of our foreign policy. In that vein, \r\nwe shall continue to pursue the universal abolition \r\nof the death penalty, the protection of minorities, the \r\nadvancement of the status of women and the free and safe \r\nexpression of religion or belief. We need to cooperate \r\nwisely in firmly rejecting the misrepresentation of \r\nreligions or beliefs as an instrument of disruption and \r\ndestabilization.\r\nTo achieve that goal, good laws are always \r\nnecessary, but they are not always enough. Tolerance \r\nmust be promoted through educational programmes \r\nand consistent grass-roots work, engaging the efforts \r\nof both Governments and civil society. I strongly \r\nencourage the membership of the Assembly and all \r\nrelevant international organizations to resolutely \r\npursue such an approach.\r\nThe Arab Spring has experienced difficulties, yet it \r\nhas also scored a number of remarkable achievements. \r\nNothing is easy, yet nothing is impossible. But nothing \r\ncan be achieved without goodwill and good faith, which \r\nwe will need if we want to put an end to the ongoing \r\nmassacres and the massive human rights violations in \r\nSyria. The regime in Damascus refuses to comply with \r\nthe resolutions of the Security Council, and it continues \r\nto commit indiscriminate violence against civilians. \r\nItaly fully supports the mission of the new Joint Special \r\nRepresentative for Syria and strongly urges the Security \r\nCouncil to overcome the stalemate that is preventing \r\neffective international action. History will not be \r\nlenient in judging those who bear responsibilities.\r\nNor can we underestimate the increasing danger of \r\nnuclear proliferation. Italy supports the commitment of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to obtaining \r\nclarification of the true nature of the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme. We urge Iran to fully comply with all the \r\n12-52201 55\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nsustainable development — the social, economic and \r\nenvironmental — will be part of the scenarios we face \r\nin the future. We will also have to work within the \r\nframework of the new Busan Global Partnership for \r\nEffective Development Cooperation.\r\nIn the area of climate change, sound and balanced \r\nmanagement of land and marine resources, involving \r\nstrengthened trans-boundary cooperation, deserves \r\ncloser political attention and common application. Some \r\nchallenges are particularly pressing. Tackling climate \r\nchange through coordinated emissions-reduction \r\npolicies is a prerequisite to substantially reducing, and \r\npossibly stopping, the serious degradation of planet \r\nEarth’s fragile ecosystems, on which our lives depend. \r\nIn line with our joint strategic objectives to overcome \r\nthe financial crisis, we attach great importance to \r\ninnovative sources of financing for development. Italy \r\nhas helped promote a number of significant initiatives, \r\nin particular in the health field. \r\nMigrant remittances play a key role in the \r\ndevelopment of many countries. That process will be \r\nfacilitated by achieving the commitments of the Group \r\nof Eight (G-8) and the Group of 20 to reduce the average \r\nglobal cost of transferring remittances.\r\nFood security is a priority for the Italian \r\nGovernment’s development assistance policy. In 2009, \r\nunder Italy’s presidency, the G-8 adopted the L’Aquila \r\nFood Security Initiative, a new and inclusive mechanism \r\nthat has been joined by more than 40 countries and has \r\nfunded several food security projects amounting to an \r\nestimated $22 billion. \r\nWe are still paying careful attention to policies \r\naimed at mitigating the effect of agricultural price \r\nvolatility. The availability of high-quality, healthy and \r\nsustainable food for all humankind is the historical \r\nand concrete challenge being taken up by Expo 2015 in \r\nMilan. The theme “Feeding the planet” is crucial to the \r\nglobal agenda — from the Millennium Development \r\nGoals to Rio+20 and its Zero Hunger initiative, as well \r\nas the G-8 and G-20 processes — and is particularly \r\nrelevant to the work of the United Nations system. All \r\nStates Members of the United Nations have been invited, \r\nand so far almost 100 countries and international \r\norganizations have confirmed their participation. \r\nIn conclusion, I wish to respond to the appeal \r\nyou launched in your opening address. Yes, Italy \r\nwill make an active contribution to the efforts aimed \r\nat revitalizing the General Assembly by enhancing \r\ndigest to promote the implementation of the Palermo \r\nConvention by illustrating best practices. The digest \r\nis a practical tool for law enforcement officials and \r\nprosecutors. It will be officially presented next month \r\nin Vienna, on the occasion of the sixth Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon to play a key \r\nrole in conflict prevention, the settlement of disputes \r\nand providing assistance for crisis management \r\nand nation-building, in cooperation with regional \r\norganizations. Despite the current financial juncture, \r\nItaly continues to do its part in crisis management, \r\npeacekeeping and stabilization missions. Our \r\nexpertise and resources — both military and \r\ncivilian — will remain engaged in a number of critical \r\ntheatres, especially Afghanistan and Lebanon. That \r\ncommitment constitutes a heavy burden, but one we \r\ndeem a worthy investment for the sake of the common \r\ninterest.\r\nIn that light, helping Somalia to recover its integrity \r\nand dignity will remain high on my Government’s \r\nagenda.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nhave played a crucial role in changing development \r\ncooperation policies and practices. But since they \r\nwere first agreed upon, the development landscape has \r\nchanged deeply. New challenges have emerged and \r\nother issues and processes have come to the fore. The \r\npost-2015 development agenda will therefore have to \r\ntake those trends into account. It will have to include \r\nsuch important dimensions of development as reducing \r\ninequality, fostering credible democracy, promoting \r\nhuman rights, good governance, equitable growth, \r\nmigration, employment, decent jobs and tackling \r\nclimate change.\r\nWe are very pleased with your decision, \r\nMr. President, to constitute a high-level panel to \r\ndiscuss this fundamental issue, and to appoint three \r\nimportant leaders to conduct the international debate. \r\nWe are confident that the process of defining the pillars \r\nof the future development agenda will be as inclusive as \r\npossible, while avoiding the top-down assumptions that \r\nemerged in 1995.\r\nIn our view, the post-2015 MDGs will have to be \r\nharmonized with the inputs that emerged from the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nin Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20). The three dimensions of \r\n56 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nresources through a revolution of rising expectations \r\nand during decades of dictatorship, famine and war. It \r\nis the story of bringing to justice the perpetrators of \r\nthe worst international crimes and of preventing the \r\nworst human atrocities. Now, extending freedom and \r\nharnessing new markets, it is the story of lifting billions \r\nmore out of poverty and oppression. That has been the \r\nwork of the United Nations for seven decades.\r\nThis year we assemble in the knowledge born of \r\nthose years, neither expecting perfection nor accepting \r\nthe status quo. We understanding that there is much that \r\nwe can do together, and more that we can do together \r\nthan we could ever do alone.\r\nThe United Nations articulates humankind’s \r\nhighest ideals. Even more, it makes practical progress \r\ntowards realizing those ideals in the world. There \r\nis no better example of that than the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) — specific, measurable \r\ntargets of the highest human importance that are now \r\nfamiliar to us all. Twelve years after 2000 and three \r\nyears from 2015, the progress we have made must \r\nbe just as familiar. The global economy has grown. \r\nHundreds of millions of people have lifted themselves \r\nup. That first fundamental Goal, to halve the proportion \r\nof the world’s population living in extreme poverty, has \r\nnow been achieved: 1 billion human lives transformed. \r\nA decade ago 100 million children did not get to go \r\nto school. That number has been reduced by fully one \r\nthird, and 33 million human futures have been entirely \r\nremade.\r\nBut we must all acknowledge that there are vital \r\nareas where the international community is failing to \r\nachieve change. That is why I accepted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s invitation to co-chair the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Advocacy Group alongside \r\nRwanda: to advocate for practical progress in the \r\ncoming three years. Where the world has fallen short \r\nof ambitious goals, our response must be action, not \r\ndisillusion. That is what Australia will do. We will act. \r\nWe will help improve education. Australia’s \r\ndevelopment spending on education doubled in the \r\npast five years. We will be among the world’s largest \r\neducation donors in 2015. I am especially pleased to join \r\nas an education champion in support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Education First initiative to mobilize global \r\nsupport to help achieve education for all children by \r\n2015. I am honoured to lend it Australia’s support. \r\nits role and efficiency. Today more than ever, the \r\nworld needs the authority of the United Nations. The \r\nreform of the Security Council is a key element of \r\nthis agenda. We are very much counting on members’ \r\nassistance in making it happen. An effective Security \r\nCouncil is crucial not only to meeting the challenges \r\nto peace, but also to creating a better international \r\norder. An equitable reform of the Council is a matter \r\nof continuing legitimacy, rather than of increasing the \r\nnational power of select Member States. The principles \r\nof accountability, consensus and regional empowerment \r\nmust continue to inspire our commitment.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Council of Ministers \r\nof the Republic of Italy for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Mario Monti, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Commonwealth of Australia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth \r\nof Australia.\r\nMs. Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Commonwealth of Australia, and inviting her to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Gillard (Australia): You now preside, Sir, over \r\na forum for every voice — an Assembly of all people and \r\nnations, one for no country or bloc to dominate solely \r\nor lead as one alone, where small and medium-sized \r\ncountries are truly heard. Australia warmly welcomes \r\nyour election. \r\nThe story of the United Nations is truly global, \r\nencompassing all the people of the world. It is a story of \r\nthe progress of small and medium-sized countries, not \r\njust of great Powers. It is a story of reconstruction after \r\nworld war and of the resettlement of massing millions, \r\nof navigating the winds of change and of the end of \r\ncolonialism, bringing self-determination to the world’s \r\ngreat majority, the billions of the global South. It is \r\nthe story of harnessing new sources of wealth and new \r\n12-52201 57\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\nthat guarantees development. New, clean sources of \r\nenergy deliver a new source of economic growth.\r\nAustralia is one of the world’s most successful \r\nmulticultural and multi-faith nations. The Australian \r\nexperience proves a deeply important fact. There is \r\nnothing natural or inevitable about violent conflict over \r\nreligious belief. We must reaffirm that again today. \r\nThe denigration of religious beliefs is never acceptable. \r\nAustralia seeks to be an example of freedom for all \r\nfaiths, and we support that in the wider world. However, \r\nour tolerance must never extend to tolerating religious \r\nhatred and incitement to violence. Whether such \r\nattitudes lead to attacks against members of religious \r\nminorities or diplomats or to attacks against houses of \r\nworship or diplomatic missions, the perpetrators of all \r\nsuch violence must be brought to justice and all such \r\nincitement must be condemned. Australia condemns \r\nviolence and we work for peace. \r\nWe proudly do our full part in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations for peace and security. We stringently \r\nobserve Security Council resolutions aimed at \r\ncurtailing weapons proliferation activities, like those \r\nof North Korea. We take the leading role in the United \r\nNations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste. We lead \r\nthe Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands, \r\nwhich operates with the United Nation’s endorsement. \r\nAnd we have been the largest non-NATO contributor \r\nto the United Nations-mandated International Security \r\nAssistance Force in Afghanistan. Australia will bring \r\nthat record of service to the international community \r\nto our service on the Security Council, should we \r\nhave the privilege to be elected by the United Nations \r\nmembership in October. There and beyond, our work \r\nand the work of every nation for peace must continue. \r\nAs we meet, the Syrian Government is turning \r\nthe instruments of State power against the very people \r\nwhom State power ought to protect, employing heavy \r\nweapons and ground-attack aircraft against civilians \r\nand engaging in systematic human rights abuses. \r\nSyria’s neighbours — in particular Jordan, Turkey, \r\nLebanon and Iraq — are burdened by growing numbers \r\nof refugees and are delivering vital help to desperate \r\npeople. \r\nThe United Nations has done important work \r\nalready. Australia is doing its part to help through \r\nhumanitarian aid. We must do everything we can to end \r\nthe suffering of the Syrian people and to rebuild Syrian \r\nsociety. Those who are committing crimes against \r\nWe will help increase gender equality. I am proud \r\nto announce that at the Pacific Islands Forum Australia \r\nsaid that it would work alongside our partners in the \r\nPacific on an unprecedented gender initiative: Pacific \r\nWomen Shaping Pacific Development. Australia will \r\nprovide $320 million over 10 years to support women’s \r\npolitical participation, to expand women’s leadership \r\nand to spread economic and social opportunities in \r\nthe Pacific. That is a principle underpinning every \r\nAustralian aid intervention and initiative: empowering \r\nwomen and girls.\r\nWe will help fight drug-resistant malaria. The \r\nSecretary-General has made malaria one of his key \r\npriorities for his second term. It is a priority we share. \r\nSince 2000, the world has cut the number of deaths \r\nfrom malaria by 26 per cent. Without those advances, \r\n330,000 more people would have died of malaria last \r\nyear, the great majority of them in Africa. But malaria \r\nitself is fighting back. New drug resistance in malaria \r\nmust be overcome. Later this year, Australia will hold \r\nthe Malaria 2012 meeting, bringing together political \r\nleaders, civil society and the private sector to accelerate \r\nefforts to control and eliminate malaria and combat \r\ngrowing drug resistance.\r\nWhile we are working hard to realize the MDGs in \r\nthe next three years, Australia is looking further ahead. \r\nThe year 2015 is a goal, but it is not a destination. Rather, \r\nit must be a new point of departure for much new work. \r\nAustralia pledges to contribute to the important work \r\nof the high-level panel on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nAustralia brings considerable national experience \r\nin working with conflict-affected States and least \r\ndeveloped countries, especially in our own region. We \r\nwill seek to apply what we have learned in our work since \r\n2000 to the world’s plans for beyond 2015. First, peace \r\nis an essential foundation to development, and building \r\npeace is vital to the progress of societies recovering from \r\nconflict. Peacekeepers today must be peacebuilders, \r\nnot just stopping conflict but enabling development. \r\nSecondly, there can be no poverty alleviation without \r\nthe creation of wealth and jobs. Growth alone is never \r\nsufficient; but to achieve development in the interests \r\nof all people we must create jobs and wealth. Thirdly, \r\nwe cannot make poverty history unless we also consign \r\nto history the argument that environmental protection \r\nand human development are conflicting global goals. \r\nClimate change threatens the security of the food supply \r\n58 12-52201\r\nA/67/PV.9\r\na historic commitment in Australian policy, and it will \r\nendure. \r\nWe urge a return to direct negotiations and that \r\nthose negotiations be between the two parties. That is \r\nthe only durable basis for achieving a two-State solution. \r\nThe present impasse must be overcome. Both sides \r\nneed to make compromises and avoid provocations. It \r\nwill take sacrifice on both sides to settle complex and \r\ndifficult issues such as settlements, borders, security \r\nand Jerusalem. The Israeli and Palestinian people \r\ndeserve no less.\r\nAustralia’s ideals in the world are those of the \r\nUnited Nations, and Australians know the practical \r\nvalue of the United Nations work. That is why Australia \r\nseeks to serve in all the work of the United Nations and \r\non the Security Council. We are a strong democracy, \r\nwelcoming all the peoples, languages and religions \r\nof the world. We are a country of the Asia-Pacific, a \r\nneighbour to developing countries, with a perspective \r\nof both the North and South. We are a State with a \r\ndecades-long tradition of capable and committed work \r\nin the United Nations. We contributed to the first \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force in 1947, and we lead \r\ncontemporary peacebuilding in our own region.\r\nWe support the development of new norms to \r\nenable the United Nations and its States Members to \r\nact to prevent atrocities and to make the perpetrators of \r\nthe worst crimes accountable for them. We act as a first \r\nresponder to humanitarian need, as a donor who stays \r\nthe course and as a partner in rebuilding after conflict. \r\nAustralia embraces the high ideals of the United Nations \r\nand takes a practical approach to achieving change. The \r\nwork of the United Nations is a historic task in which \r\nAustralia wholeheartedly joins.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth \r\nof Australia for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Julia Gillard, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4 p.m.\r\nhumanity must be held accountable. The international \r\ncommunity must unite behind Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, \r\nthe Joint Special Representative of the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States for Syria. We urge the \r\nmembers of the Security Council to do so and to act \r\ndecisively.\r\nThe international community must also unite in \r\nguarding against the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. It is now six years since the Security \r\nCouncil first expressed concern about Iran’s nuclear \r\nweapons programme. Iran still refuses to take the urgent \r\nsteps necessary to build confidence that its nuclear \r\nprogramme is exclusively peaceful. In contravention \r\nof successive International Atomic Energy Agency and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, Iran is moving closer to \r\nhaving the capacity to produce weapons-grade material. \r\nWe therefore stand with the world, united in \r\nsending a strong signal, through Security Council \r\nsanctions, that Iran must change its behaviour now. A \r\nnuclear-armed Iran would be a major threat to regional \r\nand global security, especially given the shocking and \r\naggressive statements about Israel by Iran’s leadership. \r\nThere remains the opportunity for diplomacy, backed \r\nup by robust sanctions, to persuade Iran to change its \r\ncourse. Iran must take this opportunity for change, and \r\nthe nations of the Assembly must press it to do so. \r\nThere must also be change in the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. Australia shares the frustration of the parties \r\nat the current impasse. \r\nWe understand the strong desire of the Palestinian \r\npeople for national self-determination. Australia \r\nis resolutely committed to the establishment of a \r\nPalestinian State that is both independent and viable. \r\nThat is why we provide significant support to the \r\nfoundations of a future Palestinian State and build its \r\ninfrastructure and economy. More than $300 million in \r\naid has been provided for the period from 2011 to 2016. \r\nWe commend the genuine progress President Abbas \r\nand Prime Minister Fayyad have made in building \r\nthe institutions and infrastructure for statehood. And \r\nno one can doubt Australia’s close and continuing \r\nfriendship with Israel. Our support for the right of \r\nIsrael and its people to exist in security and peace is \r\n"
