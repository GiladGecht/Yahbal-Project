"The meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nHigh-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament\r\nAgenda item 99\r\nGeneral and complete disarmament\r\n (aa) Nuclear disarmament\r\nThe President: I declare open the High-level \r\nMeeting of the General Assembly on Nuclear \r\nDisarmament. This meeting is held in accordance with \r\nAssembly resolution 67/39 of 3 December 2012.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: I warmly welcome everyone to \r\nthis High-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament. This \r\nMeeting serves to strengthen efforts for the elimination \r\nof weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \r\nweapons, and to identify ways to eliminate nuclear \r\ndangers. I wish to extend my appreciation to all \r\nMember States and our Secretariat, which have taken \r\npart in bringing this historic event to fruition 67 years \r\nafter the first General Assembly resolution (resolution \r\n1 (I)) was adopted on today’s topic.\r\nThe journey to this point has been challenging and \r\nfraught with disappointment, and now it is incumbent \r\nupon us to ensure that we reach our desired destination. \r\nIt was on 10 January 1946 that the General Assembly \r\ngathered for its inaugural meeting in London. At that \r\ntime, the nascent Assembly adopted its very first \r\nresolution on a matter that was, and still is, paramount \r\nto human civilization. The resolution called for specific \r\nproposals “for the elimination from national armaments \r\nof atomic weapons and of all other major weapons \r\nadaptable to mass destruction” (resolution 1 (I), para. \r\n5(c)).\r\nIn 1946, with the world recently traumatized by the \r\nhorrors of atomic weapons, there was no greater threat \r\nimaginable to international peace and security. Let us \r\nfast forward to today, 67 years later. We have assembled \r\nhere for the very first time in a high-level meeting on \r\nthis critical subject. We do so against a backdrop of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and the technology to \r\nproduce them having become commonplace and the \r\ndanger of proliferation very real. We should make no \r\nmistake about it — this is an historic meeting that will \r\nhave lasting implications for our present well-being and \r\nour shared future.\r\nAs we go about our day-to-day lives, which for \r\nmany are fraught with deep worries about feeding their \r\nfamilies and finding clean water and safe shelter, we \r\nare not confronted by a constant worry about the threat \r\nof nuclear weapons. Yet all the while in our current \r\nworld, the spectre of nuclear weapons — and, let me \r\nadd, all weapons — still haunts us and is the reason \r\nwhy we gather today.\r\nIn December, when the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 67/39 to convene this Meeting, it called for a \r\nsafer world for all and for achieving peace and security in \r\na world without nuclear weapons. The resolution recalls \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) — our \r\ncollective aspiration to live in a world free of want and \r\nfear — and it reiterates the commitment to keeping all \r\noptions open for eliminating nuclear weapons, including \r\na possible international conference to that end.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.11\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n11th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 26 September 2013, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Therefore, as called for previously \r\nby this Assembly in resolution 67/40, I urge members \r\nto devote part of the resources made available by the \r\nimplementation of disarmament and arms limitation \r\nagreements to economic and social development.\r\nOn 21 September 1998, a man we all admire for his \r\ncourage and his convictions stood in this very assembly \r\nof nations at its fifty-third session and said,\r\n“We must face the fact that after countless \r\ninitiatives and resolutions, we still do not have \r\nconcrete and generally accepted proposals \r\nsupported by a clear commitment by the nuclear-\r\nweapon States to the speedy, final and total \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons and nuclear-weapon \r\ncapabilities.” (A/53/PV.7, p. 14)\r\nIn his speech, he made the link between nuclear \r\ndisarmament and the need to eliminate poverty and \r\nensure human well-being for all. He then posed the \r\nfollowing question\r\n“to those who have elaborated sophisticated \r\narguments to justify their refusal to eliminate \r\nthese terrible and terrifying weapons of mass \r\ndestruction — why do they need them anyway?” \r\n(ibid.)\r\nThat man’s name is Nelson Mandela, and today I \r\nbelieve we owe it to ourselves and the citizens of the \r\nworld to provide an honourable and fitting answer to \r\nhis question, because he is a man who, in the view of \r\nmany, deserves our answer. Sixty-seven years have \r\ngone by and it is now time for us to come together and \r\nresolve this issue.\r\nToday’s historic High-level Meeting provides an \r\nopportunity to honour the vision of the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and to renew our commitment to a world \r\nfree of fear. A world with catastrophic weapons is not \r\nsafe and does not help to achieve peace and security \r\nfor all. As President of the General Assembly, I stand \r\nready to provide any support possible to strengthen \r\nand further the disarmament agenda, which is already \r\na high priority for the Assembly. Building on today’s \r\nThe Assembly has in fact consistently stated its \r\ncommitment to nuclear disarmament. It is an aspiration \r\nthat has been echoed in numerous resolutions, \r\ninternational treaties and initiatives in the decades \r\nfollowing the Hiroshima attack. By gathering at the \r\nhighest levels, we stand committed to a peaceful \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons. Yet the concrete and \r\nmeaningful progress that should accompany our \r\naspiration has largely been missing.\r\nMany attempts to rid the world of the most powerful \r\nand destructive weapons ever built have failed. Some \r\nof our multilateral disarmament forums, particularly \r\nthe Conference on Disarmament, have not advanced \r\ntheir agendas in the way we would have hoped. Further, \r\nalthough the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\nwas adopted almost 20 years ago by the Assembly, it \r\nhas still not entered into force.\r\nThroughout recent decades, we have been \r\ncontinually stymied by differing views and approaches. \r\nHowever, there are many committed individuals \r\nand organizations actively working on the nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation agendas. Our very \r\nown Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, has kept \r\nnuclear disarmament as a priority, putting forth his \r\nfive-point nuclear disarmament proposal in October \r\n2010. We have seen valuable contributions from, \r\namong others, the Open-ended Working Group on \r\nTaking Forward Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament \r\nNegotiations, which met in Geneva, and from a \r\nconsortium of United Nations Members that is focused \r\non the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of \r\nnuclear-weapon use.\r\nCivil society has also been active and engaged \r\nin pushing this agenda forward. Seventy-seven \r\nnon-governmental organizations with more than 180 \r\nrepresentatives have registered for today’s High-level \r\nMeeting. Each of these contributions has an important \r\nrole to play, and we rely on this continued commitment \r\nto remind the world why we need to be more resolute on \r\nthe path to zero weapons.\r\nWe are now in the second week of the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, for which I have \r\nselected the theme “The post-2015 development agenda: \r\nsetting the stage”. At first glance, perhaps there is no \r\ndirect link between today’s Meeting, this theme and the \r\nother high-level meetings of the week. But a broader \r\nexamination reveals something we all know to be true. \r\nAs we put time, resources and energy into maintaining \r\n13-48650 3/11\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.11\r\nmaterials, and enhanced physical security. The \r\nReview Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) have \r\nyielded disarmament commitments that the parties \r\nexpect to be fulfilled.\r\nYet much remains to be done. The transparency \r\nof nuclear-weapon stocks, delivery systems and fissile \r\nmaterial remains weak and uneven. The nuclear-weapon \r\nStates have a special responsibility to intensify their \r\nefforts. Let us remember that nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation are mutually reinforcing. Today I \r\nonce again call upon the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to demonstrate its commitment to verifiable \r\ndenuclearization. I urge the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nto fulfil its pledge to enhance the transparency of its \r\nnuclear programme. I urge those countries outside the \r\nNPT regime to accede to it without delay and without \r\nconditions.\r\nIf the global disarmament process is to be credible \r\nand sustainable, universality should be achieved for all \r\nkey instruments, including the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty. It is also time for new binding legal \r\ncommitments. That should begin with revitalizing the \r\ndisarmament machinery, particularly the Conference \r\non Disarmament. The Conference should take up the \r\nfissile material cut-off treaty as a top priority.\r\nStates without nuclear weapons have much to \r\ncontribute, as seen in the expanded cooperation among \r\nmembers of regional nuclear-weapon-free zones. A \r\nMiddle East zone free of nuclear weapons and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction is needed now more than \r\never. I will continue to promote its establishment.\r\nFinally, I wish to thank members of civil society for \r\nall they have done to promote disarmament efforts and \r\nadvance disarmament and non-proliferation education. \r\nNext month, it will be five years since I launched \r\nmy five-point proposal on nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. Many countries have shown strong \r\nsupport. Civil society has also embraced it in a very \r\nencouraging way. I will continue to explore all avenues \r\nto advance these efforts and look forward to the \r\nAssembly’s ongoing support. We simply must do more \r\nto meet the disarmament challenge.\r\nThis agenda cannot languish. It must advance for \r\nour common humanity. It is now up to the Member \r\nStates to add to the historical legacy of this gathering \r\nby taking meaningful, practical steps to achieve our \r\ngreat disarmament goal. In this noble pursuit, Members \r\nMeeting and the work many members are already \r\ndoing, we can make significant progress to advance \r\nthe agenda before us and to create a world that honours \r\nwhat we truly value — security, peace, prosperity and \r\nhuman well-being.\r\nI now give the f loor to His Excellency the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon.\r\nThe Secretary-General (spoke in French): I begin \r\nby thanking you, Sir, for having arranged this event in \r\ncollaboration with Member States and with the support \r\nof civil society. Today and together, we are making \r\nhistory. This is the first-ever High-level Meeting on \r\nNuclear Disarmament held by the General Assembly. \r\nThat is all the more remarkable since this body has a \r\nlong record of advocacy in this field.\r\nIn its very first resolution (resolution 1 (I)), adopted \r\nin 1946, the General Assembly identified nuclear \r\ndisarmament as a leading goal of the Organization. \r\nDecades later, the objective of general and complete \r\ndisarmament — combining the elimination of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and the regulation of conventional \r\narms — remains a top priority. The efforts this year \r\nof the Open-ended Working Group on Taking Forward \r\nMultilateral Nuclear Disarmament Negotiations is \r\nfurther evidence of that commitment.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nSome might complain that nuclear disarmament \r\nis little more than a dream, but that ignores the very \r\ntangible benefits that disarmament would have for all \r\nhumankind. Its success would strengthen international \r\npeace and security. It would free up vast and much-\r\nneeded resources for social and economic development. \r\nIt would advance the rule of law. It would spare the \r\nenvironment and help to keep nuclear materials from \r\nterrorist or extremist groups. And it would remove a \r\nlayer of fear that clouds all human existence.\r\nLet us also remember that failure carries a heavy \r\nprice. I was profoundly moved to be the first United \r\nNations Secretary-General to attend the Peace Memorial \r\nCeremony in Hiroshima. I also visited Nagasaki. Sadly, \r\nwe know the terrible humanitarian consequences of the \r\nuse of even one weapon. As long as such a policy exists, \r\nso too will the risks of use and proliferation. \r\nSome progress has been made. Declared stockpiles \r\nhave been falling for decades. Some nuclear-weapon \r\nStates have closed test sites, eliminated certain \r\nnuclear weapons, ceased to produce nuclear-weapon \r\n4/11 13-48650\r\nA/68/PV.11 26/09/2013\r\nestablishing such zones, withdraw any reservations \r\nor interpretative declarations incompatible with their \r\nobject and purpose, and respect the denuclearization \r\nstatus of these zones. NAM urges the early signing \r\nand ratification by the nuclear-weapon States of the \r\nProtocol to the Treaty on the South-East Asia Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone and its related documents without \r\nreservations.\r\nAlmost four decades of international efforts to \r\nestablish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle \r\nEast have regrettably failed. Urgent practical \r\nsteps towards the establishment of such a zone are \r\nnecessary. Israel, the only non-party to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in \r\nthat region, should join without further delay. At the \r\nsame time, all nuclear activities in the region should \r\nbe subject to the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\ncomprehensive safeguards.\r\nThe international community must redouble its \r\nefforts in support of the establishment of this zone, \r\nwhich would contribute to the objective of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. I reaffirm that the NAM States parties \r\nto the NPT urge the convening of the conference on \r\nthe establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction \r\nwithout further delay, with the participation of all \r\ncountries in the region, to avoid unwanted consequences.\r\nThe world has waited too long for nuclear \r\ndisarmament. The indefinite possession of nuclear \r\nweapons cannot be tolerated nor can their complete \r\nelimination be further delayed. Nuclear-weapon \r\nStates have the primary responsibility for nuclear \r\ndisarmament. I strongly urge them to comply with this \r\nlong overdue legal obligation.\r\nThe fulfilment of nuclear disarmament obligations \r\nmust not be delayed any further or held hostage \r\nto progress on non-proliferation or the perceived \r\nnotions of strategic stability. Nuclear disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing. They \r\nshould be pursued simultaneously, not one at the cost \r\nof the other. Non-proliferation derives its legitimacy \r\nfrom the larger objective of nuclear disarmament. \r\nIt should be implemented in a comprehensive and \r\nnon-discriminatory manner.\r\nAs long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their \r\nuse, threat of use and proliferation persist. The only \r\nabsolute guarantee is their total elimination. Pending \r\nthat day, nuclear-weapon States should refrain from \r\nhave my profound admiration and full support. I thank \r\nthem for their commitment and engagement.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Hassan Rouhani, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who will make \r\na statement on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nPresident Rouhani (spoke in Farsi; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is a special privilege to \r\naddress this historic gathering. The participation of \r\nmany world leaders in this first-ever High-level Meeting \r\nof the General Assembly on Nuclear Disarmament is \r\nindeed a clear manifestation of the wide support for \r\nthis important subject. On behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM) that initiated this Meeting, I thank \r\nthe General Assembly for its support.\r\nI am also very grateful to you, Mr. President, for \r\nyour efforts and those of your predecessor in organizing \r\nthis Meeting. I also thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nremarks.\r\nA peaceful and secure world remains a shared \r\nideal for us all. The horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki \r\ndeepened our resolve to prevent the recurrence of \r\nsuch unspeakable death and destruction. To that end, \r\nthe very first resolution of the Assembly (resolution 1 \r\n(I)) rightfully called for ridding the world of nuclear \r\nweapons. We now have an architecture of treaties, \r\nnorms and forums that aims to achieve this agreed \r\ngoal. Yet thousands of these weapons continue to pose \r\nthe greatest threat to peace. Steps for de-targeting, \r\nde-alerting or reducing the number of nuclear weapons \r\nare not a substitute for their total elimination. Any use \r\nof nuclear weapons is a violation of the United Nations \r\nCharter and a crime against humanity. Doctrines \r\njustifying such use are unacceptable. Likewise, the \r\npractice of threatening non-nuclear-weapon States \r\nwith nuclear weapons should end. The modernization \r\nof these weapons also undercuts efforts for their total \r\nabolition. These should therefore be stopped.\r\nI wish to recognize the important contribution of \r\nsome non-nuclear-weapon States to nuclear disarmament \r\nby voluntarily renouncing or dismantling nuclear \r\nweapons. I also recognize the valuable contribution \r\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones to nuclear disarmament \r\nand international peace and security. I commend the \r\nseminal role of non-nuclear-weapon States, particularly \r\nthe NAM States, which make up the bulk of these zones.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement calls upon all nuclear-\r\nweapon States to ratify related protocols to all treaties \r\n13-48650 5/11\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.11\r\nFifty-two years after Kennedy’s speech, nuclear \r\nweapons still pose an existential threat to humankind. \r\nOur collective efforts to move away from the nuclear \r\nabyss have remained too modest in ambition and brought \r\nonly limited success. Today’s High-level Meeting on \r\nNuclear Disarmament is an excellent opportunity to \r\ngive urgency, focus and new momentum to this long-\r\nheld goal.\r\nThe discourse on nuclear weapons has long \r\nbeen dominated by traditional national security \r\nconsiderations, but in an age of globalization and in the \r\nlight of the global consequences of nuclear weapons, \r\nit is overdue to move beyond this narrow perspective. \r\nNuclear weapons pose an unacceptable risk to \r\nhumankind. Any nuclear weapon use would cause \r\nsevere humanitarian emergencies and have global \r\nconsequences for the environment, health, human \r\ndevelopment and the economy.\r\nA very important conference took place in Norway \r\nearlier this year. Its message was clear — a nuclear-\r\nweapon detonation today would cause destruction \r\nand human suffering on a scale far exceeding the \r\ndevastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It would cause \r\na humanitarian emergency beyond the capabilities of \r\nany State or international body to provide adequate \r\nassistance. It would not be constrained by national \r\nborders but would affect communities regionally as \r\nwell as globally.\r\nI welcome the active role of civil society and the \r\nincreased international focus on the humanitarian \r\nimpact of nuclear weapons, such as in the unprecedented \r\njoint statement of 80 States parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\nThey underscored that every effort must be exerted to \r\neliminate this threat. The follow-up conference planned \r\nto be held in Mexico next year will be an important \r\nopportunity to raise awareness of the real consequences \r\nof nuclear-weapon use.\r\nThe occurrence of such global humanitarian \r\nconsequences is not a remote and unrealistic scenario. \r\nNine States are  already in possession of nuclear weapons, \r\nbut overcoming the technological challenges to build \r\nthese weapons is no longer limited to a small number \r\nof States. More and more States — and potentially \r\nnon-State actors — will be in a de facto position to reach \r\nor even cross the line of nuclear-weapon capability. The \r\ndecision to do so will increasingly become a political \r\nrather than a technological one.\r\nany threat or use of nuclear weapons against any \r\nnon-nuclear-weapon State in any circumstances. The \r\ncurrent declarations on negative security assurances \r\nare inadequate. They must be codified into a universal \r\nlegal instrument.\r\nNuclear disarmament remains our highest priority. \r\nIn order to advance the nuclear disarmament agenda, \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement proposes therefore the \r\nfollowing road map. First, negotiations should begin \r\nas soon as possible in the Conference on Disarmament \r\non a comprehensive convention on nuclear weapons \r\nfor the prohibition of their possession, development, \r\nproduction, acquisition, testing, stockpiling, transfer, \r\nuse or threat of use, and for their destruction.\r\nSecondly, the date of 26 September should be \r\ndesignated as an international day to renew our resolve \r\nto completely eliminate nuclear weapons. We invite all \r\nGovernments and civil society, academia, and media to \r\njoin hands in making this vision a reality.\r\nThirdly, in five years convene a high-level \r\ninternational conference on nuclear disarmament to \r\nreview progress in this regard. The Movement will \r\npresent a draft resolution to this Assembly regarding \r\nthis road map. I trust that it will enjoy members’ \r\nsupport.\r\nNo nation should possess nuclear weapons, since \r\nthere are no right hands for these wrong weapons, as the \r\nSecretary-General has rightly put it. NAM is determined \r\nto make every effort to realize the vision of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world without further delay. Instead of \r\nnuclear weapons let us invest in development and in \r\neradicating poverty, ignorance and diseases. Let us \r\nbestow upon future generations a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. That is their right and our responsibility. Let us \r\nprove that we are the United Nations, nations united for \r\npeace.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Heinz Fischer, Federal \r\nPresident of the Republic of Austria.\r\nPresident Fischer: On 25 September 1961, \r\nPresident Kennedy delivered a landmark address before \r\nthis very Assembly. He invoked the vivid notion of a \r\nnuclear sword of Damocles \r\n“hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable \r\nof being cut at any moment by accident or \r\nmiscalculation or by madness” (A/PV.1013, para. \r\n50).\r\n6/11 13-48650\r\nA/68/PV.11 26/09/2013\r\nI am honoured and privileged to address this \r\nimportant meeting, share my thoughts on some of \r\nthe issues under discussion, and thereby contribute \r\nto sending a clear and strong message of the need to \r\ntake resolute measures aimed at promoting a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons. We have gathered here today \r\nbecause we all support the bold vision of a world free \r\nof nuclear weapons and believe that it can be achieved \r\nwith persistent effort, mutual understanding, hard \r\nnegotiations and the close cooperation of all members \r\nof the international community, especially the nuclear-\r\nweapon States.\r\nNuclear disarmament has multiple aspects, each \r\nof which needs careful consideration. Due to time \r\nconstraints I shall briefly focus on some issues, and \r\nfirst on the banning of nuclear weapons. \r\nMongolia supports the Secretary’s five-point \r\nproposal on nuclear disarmament. Hence, it agrees \r\nthat one of the most urgent issues to be addressed is \r\nthe banning of nuclear weapons. It believes that it is \r\nhigh time to start negotiations on the nuclear weapons \r\nconvention, a preliminary draft of which has already \r\nbeen circulated to Member States. The results of the \r\nmeetings of the Open-ended Working Group and \r\nthe humanitarian effects of nuclear weapons clearly \r\nunderline the urgency of such an action. In this \r\nconnection, I join the call to designate 26 September \r\nthe international day for the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons.\r\nSecondly, with regard to disarmament negotiations \r\nand campaigns, it is regrettable that the sole multilateral \r\ndisarmament negotiating forum, the Conference \r\non Disarmament, has not been able to live up to \r\nexpectations. Although consultations are under way \r\nto revitalize its work, the Conference on Disarmament \r\nremains paralysed. The international community should \r\nnot be at the mercy of individual States in matters that \r\naffect the vital interests of all. That is why international \r\npractice has demonstrated the indispensable role of \r\ncoalitions of States and non-governmental organizations \r\nwhen the disarmament machinery fails, as exemplified \r\nby the successful conclusion of the Convention on \r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production \r\nand Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \r\nDestruction in 1997 and the Convention on Cluster \r\nMunitions in 2008.\r\nThirdly, the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzones has proven to be an effective regional measure \r\nAs the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation \r\nincreases, so does the risk of their use by someone, \r\nsomewhere. I see only one approach — we must build \r\ncredible political and legal barriers against nuclear \r\nweapons as such.\r\nRegrettably, the value of these weapons as so-\r\ncalled ultimate guarantors of security is still being \r\nclaimed. Nuclear deterrence, however, is a very high-\r\nrisk approach to both national and global security. \r\nThe notion that Governments are rational enough to \r\nhandle nuclear deterrence and that nuclear deterrence \r\nworks because it makes Governments act rationally is \r\na dangerous circular argument. Nuclear deterrence is \r\njust as fallible as any other human concept. Relying \r\non mutually assured destruction as the foundation \r\nof international relations and stability is neither \r\nresponsible nor sustainable. The conclusion is evident. \r\nNuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts can \r\nbe achieved only together.\r\nTherefore, much greater effort across regional \r\ngroups is necessary with a clear focus on a common \r\ngoal — a world without nuclear weapons. It is \r\nencouraging that the General Assembly has taken up \r\nthis issue with a renewed sense of responsibility. The \r\ndecision to convene today’s High-level Meeting on \r\nNuclear Disarmament was one important initiative. \r\nThe establishment in Geneva of the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group to Take Forward Multilateral Nuclear \r\nDisarmament Negotiations was another. The Working \r\nGroup successfully concluded its work only last month. \r\nIt provided an important opportunity for serious \r\ndiscussions on the elements that would be required for \r\nthe achievement and maintenance of a world without \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nEarlier this year, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nsaid, “There are no right hands for the wrong weapons”. \r\nHe is entirely right and I fully agree. The peoples of \r\nthe world have the right to live without this menace. It \r\nis time to move beyond this deadly twentieth-century \r\nlegacy. Nuclear weapons must be stigmatized, banned \r\nand eliminated before they abolish us.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, \r\nPresident of Mongolia.\r\nPresident Tsakhia: I would ask the secretariat to \r\nhave the complete version of my statement circulated as \r\nan official document.\r\n13-48650 7/11\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.11\r\nand I have invited the countries of the region to an \r\nopen dialogue so as gradually to build confidence in \r\nthe region.\r\nLet us spare no effort to move nuclear disarmament \r\nforward. Today’s momentous gathering should give the \r\nneeded boost.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, \r\nPrime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I should \r\nlike to convey my profound gratitude to Ambassador \r\nVuk Jeremić, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session; to you, Ambassador John Ashe, \r\nPresident of Assembly at the current session; and to \r\nthose who have contributed to the convening of this \r\nmeeting. I am highly honoured to take the f loor at this \r\nfirst High-level Meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nNuclear Disarmament.\r\nJapan is the only country that has ever suffered \r\nthe devastation caused by the use of atomic bombs \r\nin wartime. We know from experience the aftermath \r\nof the use of nuclear weapons, and their elimination \r\nhas been the Japanese people’s unwavering aspiration \r\nsince the end of the Second World War. For my part, I \r\nparticipated in the commemorative peace ceremonies \r\nheld this August in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, where I \r\nrenewed my strong determination to achieve a world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons.\r\nA world free of nuclear weapons is a major goal not \r\nonly for Japan but is also for all humankind. However, \r\nin reality a massive number of nuclear weapons remain, \r\nand in some areas nuclear arsenals are supposedly \r\nincreasing with a lack of transparency. Given the \r\npossibility of nuclear terrorism by non-State actors \r\nand the nuclear development efforts of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, the nuclear risk we face is \r\nmore diverse and challenging than it was in the Cold \r\nWar era.\r\nIn such circumstances, Japan regrets the long-\r\nstanding stalemate in the Conference on Disarmament \r\nin Geneva. As the current international situation \r\nis becoming ever more unpredictable, now is the \r\ntime to revitalize our efforts to advance on key \r\nnuclear disarmament issues in parallel with nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation, such as promoting the entry into force \r\nof the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and the \r\nof non-proliferation and disarmament. The existing \r\nzones need to be strengthened and measures taken to \r\npromote the establishment of new zones, including in \r\nthe Middle East and in North-East Asia. Since the latter \r\nhave lingering disputes, the establishment of zones will \r\nnot be easy, but that should not deter or discourage us. \r\nThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones has \r\nproduced a great wealth of experience that would be \r\nuseful in establishing new ones. Therefore, Mongolia is \r\nproposing that the United Nations undertake a second \r\ncomprehensive study on the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones in all its aspects, since the first such \r\npractical study was undertaken 38 years ago and proved \r\nuseful in establishing the above zones.\r\nFourthly, as to Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free \r\nstatus, in line with a vision of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld, more than 20 years ago Mongolia, situated \r\nbetween two nuclear-weapon States, declared itself \r\na single State nuclear-weapon-free zone and has \r\nbeen working hard to institutionalize that status. At \r\nthe national level, in 2000 it adopted legislation that \r\nclearly defined the status and criminalized acts that \r\nwould violate it. In September 2012, the five nuclear-\r\nweapon States signed a joint declaration that not only \r\nrecognized Mongolia’s nuclear-weapon-free status, but \r\nalso committed them to respecting that status and to not \r\ncontributing to any act that would violate it. Thus, we \r\nhave a pledge by all the permanent five that Mongolia \r\nwill not be pressured to accept any part of a system \r\nof nuclear weapons. It will therefore not allow itself to \r\nbe used as a pawn in future geopolitical competition \r\nand great-Power rivalry. A stable, non-aligned and \r\nreassured Mongolia will be a zone of confidence and \r\nstability, a territory that will not be used to harm the \r\ninterests of others. Mongolia’s experience inspires and \r\ndemonstrates that even small States can contribute to \r\npromoting the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons.\r\nFifthly, concerning North-East Asia, as a country \r\nwith first-hand experience in ensuring security \r\nprimarily by political and diplomatic means, Mongolia \r\nis prepared on an informal basis to work with the \r\ncountries of North-East Asia to see if and how a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone could be established in the region. \r\nAlthough we know well that that will not be easy and \r\nwill require courage, political will and perseverance, \r\nit is doable, even if not right away. In the meantime, \r\nsteps should be taken to promote greater confidence. \r\nWith that in mind, in March I proposed to start the \r\nUlaanbaatar dialogue on North-East Asian security, \r\n8/11 13-48650\r\nA/68/PV.11 26/09/2013\r\ndecades Japan has welcomed the visits of participants \r\nin the United Nations Programme of Fellowships on \r\nDisarmament. Furthermore, special communicators \r\nfor a world without nuclear weapons have been \r\ndispatched worldwide to convey the testimonies of their \r\nsurvival of the atomic bombings. All political leaders \r\nresponsible for their citizens’ safety should recognize \r\nthe humanitarian consequences of the use of nuclear \r\nweapons. I therefore invite all political leaders to visit \r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki to witness at first hand the \r\nimpact of the use of such weapons.\r\nSymbolically, Hiroshima and Nagasaki will \r\ncommemorate the seventieth anniversary of those tragic \r\nevents in 2015 when the next NPT Review Conference \r\nwill be held. I should like to remind all present here \r\ntoday that their political leadership is indispensable \r\nto advancing nuclear disarmament. In addition, the \r\n2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, \r\nrecently announced to be held in Tokyo, coincide with \r\nthe annual memorial ceremonies in Hiroshima and \r\nNagasaki. I should like to make the Tokyo Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games a sports festival where we think of \r\npeace together with citizens throughout the world.\r\nTo conclude my statement I should like to stress \r\nthat the time has come for both nuclear-weapon States \r\nand non-nuclear-weapon States to overcome their \r\ndifferences and unite in their efforts as a whole to \r\nachieve the total elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Viola Onwuliri, Minister of State for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Nigeria.\r\nMs. Onwuliri (Nigeria): Let me begin by expressing \r\nthe appreciation of my President, His Excellency \r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, for the invitation to address the \r\nopening segment of this historic High-level Meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly on Nuclear Disarmament. His \r\nExcellency has also requested that I convey his very \r\nwarm regards and felicitations to all participants and \r\nconvey his regrets at his inability to be here physically.\r\nI also wish to acknowledge at this point the \r\npresence here of eminent Heads of Government to \r\nadd strength and credibility to what we are doing here \r\ntoday. I also commend the efforts of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, as well as those of his predecessor, \r\nto organize this Meeting. I should like to seize this \r\nopportunity to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ninsightful remarks. This initiative of the Non-Aligned \r\nearly launch of negotiations on and the conclusion of a \r\nfissile material cut-off treaty.\r\nAn essential element in the process of nuclear \r\ndisarmament is for all States possessing nuclear \r\nweapons to reduce their nuclear arsenals and to \r\nenhance their transparency. In this connection, Japan \r\nappreciates the speech President Obama delivered in \r\nBerlin in June, when he declared a reduction in the \r\nUnited States deployed strategic nuclear weapons \r\nof up to one-third. It is my hope that the President’s \r\nspeech will trigger a further reduction by the Russian \r\nFederation and the United States and that their bilateral \r\nnuclear reduction negotiations will soon develop into \r\nmultilateral negotiations among all nuclear-weapon \r\nStates. I also call upon the five nuclear-weapon States to \r\nreport their concrete measures on nuclear disarmament \r\non the occasion of the third session of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for the 2015 Review Conference of the \r\nParties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, in 2014.\r\nI should like to emphasize that the responsibilities \r\nof the non-nuclear-weapon States are as important as \r\nthose of the nuclear-weapon States. Building realistic \r\nand practical areas of mutual trust between those two \r\nsides is the most definitive path to achieve a world free \r\nof nuclear weapons. Based upon the desire for eternal \r\npeace enshrined in the Japanese National Constitution \r\nand the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, Japan \r\nupholds its firm commitment to the three non-nuclear \r\nprinciples and has dedicated itself to world peace and \r\nprosperity. It will continue faithfully to devote itself to \r\nnuclear disarmament until it is achieved.\r\nEvery year since 1994, Japan has submitted to \r\nthe General Assembly a draft resolution on nuclear \r\ndisarmament that has been adopted by overwhelming \r\nmajorities. My Foreign Minister, Mr. Fumio Kishida, \r\nwho will be making a speech this afternoon, will host \r\nthe Foreign Ministers’ meeting of the Non-Proliferation \r\nand Disarmament Initiative (NPDI) in Hiroshima, a \r\ncity that suffered atomic bombing, in April 2014. I am \r\nconfident that the NPDI Foreign Ministers will launch a \r\nmeaningful initiative through their close collaboration.\r\nThe devastation that occurred in Hiroshima and \r\nNagasaki reminds us of the humanitarian consequences \r\nof the use of nuclear weapons. Such consequences could \r\nextend beyond our imagination, and such tragedies \r\nmust never recur. In order to share our experience \r\nwith the international community, for more than three \r\n13-48650 9/11\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.11\r\ncapacity of all possessors of such weapons to use them. \r\nMy country, Nigeria, believes that the time has come for \r\nthe commencement of negotiations on a comprehensive \r\nconvention on nuclear weapons that addresses \r\nthe prohibition of their possession, development, \r\nproduction, acquisition, testing, stockpiling, transfer, \r\nuse or threat of use, and destruction.\r\nI must acknowledge the little progress that has \r\nbeen  made, particularly in the few bilateral agreements \r\nfreely entered into by some world Powers to reduce the \r\nnumber of their nuclear arsenals. Notwithstanding these \r\narrangements, the bigger existential threat remains \r\nthat, irrespective of the number of these weapons left \r\nin arsenals of States worldwide, they could one day be \r\nused, accidentally or on purpose. The explicit or implicit \r\nwillingness of any Member State of this noble body to \r\nuse nuclear weapons as a matter of policy should be \r\nconsidered to be totally unacceptable. The horrors of \r\nHiroshima and Nagasaki are all too real to contemplate \r\nanother such scenario. They should assist in deepening \r\nour resolve to prevent a recurrence of such unspeakable \r\nand unnecessary death and destruction.\r\nNigeria remains resolute in its support for total \r\nnuclear disarmament and is ready to partner with all \r\nStates willing to realize a future of progress for our \r\nchildren in a world without nuclear weapons. We should \r\nseize this momentum to address the need to unblock the \r\nimpasse in the Conference on Disarmament and other \r\ndeliberative multilateral bodies established through \r\nthe instrumentality of the General Assembly. The road \r\nthrough the negotiations could be tough and tortuous. \r\nOur collective resolve is to stay committed to all \r\nobligations, particularly in the agreed structure of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nwhile ensuring that deadlock is not acceptable if we are \r\nto prevent future catastrophe.\r\nThe contributions of nuclear-weapon-free zones \r\nremain pivotal to the overall goals of achieving the \r\nobjective of nuclear disarmament. Nigeria unvaryingly \r\nsupports the establishment of such zones across all \r\nregions, including in the Middle East. I also wish to \r\nseize this opportunity to call on all States, in particular \r\nnuclear-weapon States, to support existing treaties, to \r\nratify related protocols to all treaties establishing such \r\nzones, to withdraw reservations, and to respect the \r\ndenuclearized status of these zones.\r\nWe could not agree more with Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon that the problem is not just proliferation, but \r\nMovement, which has now crystallized in the first-ever \r\nHigh-level Meeting on Nuclear Disarmament, is both \r\ntimely and noble.\r\nOn 24 January 1946, the General Assembly took a \r\nbold and decisive step when it unanimously adopted its \r\nfirst resolution establishing a commission to deal with \r\nthe problems raised by the discovery of atomic energy. \r\nSince then, and despite the best intentions and efforts, \r\nthe challenges posed by the successor brand, nuclear \r\nweapons, have continued to haunt the world.\r\nNuclear weapons are, by definition, weapons whose \r\nsole objective is mass destruction. The question then \r\nshould be why the world planning is to mass destruct. \r\nNuclear disarmament is an idea whose time has indeed \r\nfinally come. Humankind has lived on the edge for too \r\nlong. It has repeatedly been demonstrated that nuclear \r\nweapons are inhumane and completely unacceptable \r\nweapons that should be taken off the list of global \r\narmaments by responsible and respected partners in \r\nhuman development projects. \r\nWe have also witnessed the pain of natural disasters \r\nand the miseries they unleash on States throughout the \r\nworld, including the costs of recovery and rehabilitation, \r\nwhich run into billions of dollars. But we are also \r\naware that, unlike other natural disasters, adequate \r\nhumanitarian response might not be possible following \r\na single nuclear explosion or detonation in a populated \r\narea. In view of this, States are not expected to keep \r\ndeveloping or possessing nuclear weapons. Therefore, \r\nthe zero tolerance shown by States against chemical \r\nand biological weapons, which are similar weapons of \r\nmass destruction, should be extended to all types of \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nNeed I underscore that, as we know, in the end \r\nnuclear weapons do not necessarily ensure security. On \r\nthe contrary, they exacerbate fear and entrench mutual \r\ndistrust in all ramifications due to the threat and \r\nassurance — yes, assurance — of death and destruction. \r\nThe moral watershed, I should stress, is that enormous \r\nresources that could truly address hunger and poverty \r\nand help us to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals at all levels are wasted annually in the cycle \r\nof developing, maintaining and redesigning these \r\nweapons.\r\nNo State acquires a nuclear weapon without due \r\nconsideration of its future deployment or use in one \r\ncapacity or another. In other words, the policy of nuclear \r\ndeterrence is predicated on the actual willingness and \r\n10/11 13-48650\r\nA/68/PV.11 26/09/2013\r\nand legally binding instrument on negative security \r\nassurances.\r\nWe call on all States, in particular nuclear-weapon \r\nStates, to eliminate the role that nuclear weapons play \r\nin their doctrines, military strategies and security \r\npolicies or as a prospective approach to the management \r\nof conflicts so as to achieve the total elimination of \r\nsuch weapons regardless of their type or geographical \r\nlocation.\r\nThe establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones \r\nstrengthens international and regional peace and \r\nsecurity, as well as the non-proliferation regime, and \r\nis an important contribution to nuclear disarmament. \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean are proud to be \r\nthe first densely populated area in the world to be \r\ndeclared a nuclear-weapon-free zone under the Treaty \r\nfor the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. The establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean has contributed to nuclear disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation as well as to regional and global \r\npeace and security. \r\nThe Treaty of Tlatelolco and the Agency for the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean (OPANAL) have constituted a political, legal \r\nand institutional point of reference in the establishment \r\nof other nuclear-weapon-free zones in various regions \r\nof the world. OPANAL’s experience, together with \r\nthat of the other four nuclear-weapon-free zones and \r\nMongolia as a single State unilaterally declared free \r\nof nuclear weapons, constitutes an important legacy \r\nbestowed by the international community to inspire the \r\nestablishment of new such zones and advance towards \r\nthe goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world.\r\nWe urge the nuclear Powers to withdraw all \r\ninterpretative declarations to Protocols I and II of the \r\nTlatelolco Treaty that constitute genuine reservations \r\nprohibited by the Treaty, contributing thereby to \r\neliminating the possible use of nuclear weapons against \r\ncountries of the region. We will continue working with \r\nStates parties to the Protocols in order to convince them \r\nto withdraw or modify such declarations.\r\nWe regret the failure to implement the agreement \r\non the convening in 2012 of an international conference \r\non the establishment of a Middle East zone free \r\nof nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. The convening of such a conference is \r\nan important and integral part of the final outcome \r\nthe continued existence of nuclear weapons themselves. \r\nAs he rightly highlights, there are no right hands for the \r\nwrong weapons. Our efforts to outlaw, eliminate and \r\nconsign nuclear weapons to the dustbin of history must \r\nstart now.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, who will make a statement \r\non behalf of the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates (CELAC), over which Cuba is honoured to \r\npreside, attaches great importance to the holding, for \r\nthe first time in the history of the United Nations, of a \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on Nuclear \r\nDisarmament. We are committed to participating \r\nactively and to contributing as much as possible to the \r\nsuccess of this Meeting.\r\nThe States members of CELAC reiterate their \r\ngrave concern at the threat that the ongoing existence \r\nof nuclear weapons and their potential use or threat \r\nof use poses for mankind. There is an urgent need \r\nto advance towards the primary goal of nuclear \r\ndisarmament and to achieve the complete and general \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. In this regard, CELAC \r\njoins the international community in its efforts to make \r\nprogress towards the negotiation of a universal and \r\nlegally binding instrument banning nuclear weapons. \r\nOur region attaches the highest priority to achieving \r\ncomplete and verifiable nuclear disarmament. The only \r\nguarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear \r\nweapons is their complete elimination.\r\nThe use or threat of use of nuclear weapons is a \r\ncrime against humanity and a violation of international \r\nlaw, including international humanitarian law, and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. CELAC member \r\nStates will participate actively in drafting concrete \r\nproposals to achieve universal nuclear disarmament, \r\nin accordance with a multilaterally agreed, clear, \r\nirreversible and verifiable time frame.\r\nIt is in the real interest of non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates, which includes all CELAC member States, to \r\nreceive unequivocal and legally binding assurances \r\nfrom nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of \r\nuse of such weapons. We call for a start to negotiations \r\nand the earliest possible adoption of a universal \r\n13-48650 11/11\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.11\r\non Disarmament as the single multilateral negotiating \r\nforum for disarmament. We urge the Conference to \r\ndemonstrate the necessary political will to ensure \r\nthe start, without delay, of substantive work through \r\nthe adoption and implementation of a balanced and \r\ncomprehensive programme of work that advances the \r\nagenda of nuclear disarmament.\r\nWe recognize the work of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup established by resolution 67/56 with the mandate \r\nto develop proposals to take forward multilateral \r\nnuclear disarmament negotiations. States members of \r\nCELAC have contributed concrete proposals to the \r\nGroup’s work. We reiterate the firm commitment of \r\nCELAC to working for the convening of a high-level \r\ninternational conference to identify ways and means to \r\neliminate nuclear weapons within the shortest possible \r\ntime, aimed at agreeing on a phased programme for \r\nthe complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a \r\nspecific time frame in order to ban the development, \r\nproduction, acquisition, testing, stockpiling, transfer, \r\nuse or threat of use of nuclear weapons and to stipulate \r\ntheir destruction.\r\nCELAC member States express their grave concern \r\nover the humanitarian impact of huge proportions and \r\nglobal effects of any accidental or intentional nuclear \r\ndetonation. We call upon the international community to \r\nreiterate its concern for the humanitarian consequences \r\nof nuclear weapons whenever a debate on this type of \r\nweapons takes place.\r\nWe welcome the outcome of the Oslo Conference \r\non the Humanitarian Consequences of Nuclear \r\nWeapons held in March 2013. We call upon all States \r\nto participate in the second international Conference, \r\nwhich will be held in Mexico on 13 and 14 February \r\n2014. States members of CELAC will continue to \r\ncoordinate their positions and to contribute to the \r\nimplementation of practical actions as a follow-up to \r\nthis High-level Meeting, including the adoption of a \r\ndraft resolution on the matter in the First Committee at \r\nthis sixty-eighth session.\r\nCuba, a small country which has defended its \r\nindependence, including from the threat of nuclear \r\nholocaust, will take an active part in the international \r\nmovement, as advocated by Fidel Castro Ruz, to destroy \r\nall nuclear weapons, the mere existence of which \r\nendangers the very survival of the human species.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.\r\nof the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). The outcome of that conference would be an \r\nimportant contribution towards achieving the goal of \r\nnuclear disarmament. We are firmly convinced that \r\nthe establishment of the zone would represent a truly \r\nsignificant step in the peace process in the Middle East. \r\nWe therefore urge the convening of the conference as \r\nsoon as possible.\r\nWe urge the nuclear-weapon States to fulfil their \r\ncommitments under article VI of the NPT and to advance \r\ntowards the complete elimination of those weapons. It \r\nis necessary fully and immediately to implement the 13 \r\npractical steps towards nuclear disarmament agreed at \r\nthe 2000 NPT Review Conference, as well as the plan \r\nof action adopted at the 2010 Review Conference.\r\nCELAC reaffirms the inalienable right of States to \r\ndevelop, research, produce and peacefully use nuclear \r\nenergy without discrimination and in conformity with \r\narticles I, II, III and IV of the NPT. All parties to the \r\nTreaty have committed themselves to facilitating \r\nparticipation in the fullest possible exchange of \r\nequipment, materials and scientific and technological \r\ninformation for the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nWe totally reject the updating of existing nuclear \r\nweapons and the development of new types of nuclear \r\nweapons, which is inconsistent with the obligation of \r\ncomplete nuclear disarmament. All States must refrain \r\nfrom undertaking nuclear-weapon test explosions, other \r\nnuclear explosions, or any other relevant non-explosive \r\nexperiments, including subcritical experiments, for \r\nnuclear-weapon development purposes. Such actions \r\nrun counter to the objective and purpose of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) and \r\nits spirit — if not the letter — and undermine its desired \r\nimpact as a nuclear disarmament measure.\r\nCELAC demands a total nuclear test ban and urges \r\nannex 2 States, whose ratifications are essential for the \r\nentry into force of the CTBT, to accelerate the process \r\nof signing and/or ratifying this instrument as a matter \r\nof priority and as an indication of their political will \r\nand commitment to international peace and security. \r\nWe reaffirm the importance of starting negotiations \r\non an international legally binding instrument banning \r\nnuclear weapons and our commitment towards this \r\nprimary goal.\r\nThe first special session of the General Assembly \r\ndevoted to disarmament established the Conference \r\n"
