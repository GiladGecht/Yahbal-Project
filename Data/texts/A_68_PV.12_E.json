"The meeting was called to order at 10.30 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Donald Rabindranauth Ramotar, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guyana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will hear an address \r\nby the President of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. Donald Rabindranauth Ramotar, President \r\nof the Republic of Guyana, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Donald Rabindranauth Ramotar, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guyana, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ramotar: My delegation and I warmly \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to the \r\nhigh office of President of the General Assembly. I salute \r\nyou as a distinguished son of our Caribbean community \r\nand I pledge Guyana’s unwavering support towards \r\nthe successful execution of your important duties. I \r\nwould also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his valuable service to \r\nthe Organization. And I take this occasion to reiterate \r\nour thanks to the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership and dedication to \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express \r\nour solidarity with and deepest condolences to the \r\nGovernment and people of Kenya in the wake of the \r\nrecent terrorist attacks there, which resulted in the loss \r\nof life and great pain to the people of that nation.\r\nBarely 800 days remain until the deadline for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) is reached \r\nand a post-2015 development agenda launched. It is \r\nappropriate, therefore, that the Assembly has been \r\ninvited to focus its attention on the theme of “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. A review \r\nof our experience to date will reveal that the world as \r\na whole has witnessed substantial progress towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nHowever, prospects vary significantly within and across \r\ncountries and regions, and a large number of countries \r\nare likely to come short in achieving the Goals.\r\nHealth and education challenges threaten the \r\nsustainability of hard-earned socioeconomic gains. \r\nToday, still more than 1 billion people live in extreme \r\npoverty and one in eight persons on the planet — among \r\nthem 200 million children — suffer from chronic \r\nundernourishment. In addition, we still have 57 million \r\nchildren who are out of school. This needs to be \r\nurgently corrected. We must also pay special attention \r\nto the quality of education in order to develop a \r\ngeneration of global citizens who are capable of rising \r\nto the challenges of the future. To this end, Guyana \r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s Global Education \r\nFirst Initiative as an instrument for the development \r\nof meaningful solutions to the challenges regarding \r\naccess to and quality of education.\r\nIf we are to make this world a better place for \r\neveryone, we must also address the issue of inequality. \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.12\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n12th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 26 September 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

This gave tacit support to the coup, \r\nwhich has led to violations of human rights and loss \r\nof innocent lives, and may lead to more protests and \r\npossibly violence and death. Nevertheless, it is our \r\nfervent hope that the people of that great brotherly \r\ncountry and their leaders, regardless of their political \r\npersuasion, will find a peaceful way out of the present \r\ndifficulties.\r\nMoreover, peace in the Middle East will not be \r\nrealized until we have a just solution to the Palestinian \r\ntragedy. The Palestinian people have the right to their \r\nown country. We support them in their quest for the \r\nright to live in peace and in an independent, viable \r\nPalestinian State.\r\nTurning to our own region, allow me to underscore \r\nthat the blockade against our sister Caribbean country \r\nCuba has caused serious damage to that country’s \r\neconomy and continues to be a major obstacle to \r\ndevelopment. We join the call for a lifting of the \r\nblockade and the removal of the burden that it places on \r\nthe Cuban people.\r\nThe adoption in April of the landmark Arms Trade \r\nTreaty opens the door to effective regulation of the \r\ninternational trade in conventional arms. For us in \r\nthe Caribbean, the Treaty bears relevance not only to \r\nthe safety and security of our citizens and to the fight \r\nagainst transnational crime, but also, in an important \r\nway, to our overall pursuit of sustainable development. \r\nThe funnelling of guns into our societies is a menace \r\nthat must be curbed in order to preserve our young \r\npeople and our future. As one of the first countries to \r\nratify the Treaty, Guyana urges all States to work to \r\nassure its early entry into force.\r\nWhile peace is vital to development, let me hasten \r\nto add that socioeconomic progress coupled with \r\ndemocracy is crucial to the preservation of peace. \r\nCentral to these principles are our people. They remain \r\nthe most important factor for development. That is \r\nwhy my country has been increasingly investing in \r\nthe development of our people. An examination of our \r\nnational budget will reveal that some 30 per cent of our \r\nexpenditure goes to the social sector. As a result, we \r\nhave managed to achieve several of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals well before the time envisaged. \r\nWe have achieved universal primary education and are \r\nclose to achieving universal secondary education. \r\nIncome distribution continues to be skewed in favour \r\nof the rich nations and rich persons within nations. \r\nThis gap has grown dangerously wide. Needless to say, \r\ninequality leads to great discontent and social unrest. \r\nAt the heart of many of the conflicts we see today is \r\nthe widening gap between the haves and have-nots. \r\nSometimes this is not readily visible, as the fight \r\nfor social and economic justice is often clouded by \r\ninter-ethnic, interreligious and other types of conflicts.\r\nTo defend the gains that we have made and to \r\nexpand further, it is necessary for the United Nations \r\nto focus on narrowing the gaps in income, access to \r\nsocial services, infrastructure, land distribution and \r\nother critical areas. If there is one lesson to be drawn \r\nfrom efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, it is that addressing inequality is crucial to the \r\nachievement of sustainable development objectives. The \r\napproach adumbrated in the resolution on a new global \r\nhuman order (resolution 65/120) remains relevant in the \r\nstruggle to eradicate poverty and inequality and indeed \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn setting the stage for a post-2015 agenda, we \r\nmust build on and expand the gains made. To this end, \r\nwe must create an international environment that will \r\nfacilitate the achievement of the goals that we will set \r\nfor the future. Central to our efforts must be the focus \r\non world peace. Peace and development are inseparable. \r\nPeace will be realized only if international law and \r\nthe rights of nations and their sovereignty are always \r\nrespected and upheld.\r\nIt is in this regard that I wish to view the situation \r\nin the Middle East. At the moment, Syria is at the \r\ncentre of our collective concern. The war in that sister \r\nnation has taken thousands of innocent lives. It is an \r\nillusion to believe that military intervention will bring \r\npeace to that country. What is badly needed is political \r\ndialogue among the Syrian parties. The international \r\ncommunity also has an important role to play. We \r\nwelcome the agreement between Russia and the United \r\nStates that will facilitate the destruction of chemical \r\nweapons held in Syria. We call on all countries that \r\npossess such weapons to do the same. We hope too, that \r\nterrorist forces operating in Syria will withdraw. After \r\nall, they cannot be terrorists when they were fighting \r\nin Afghanistan and Iraq, but freedom fighters when \r\nfighting the Syrian Government. A terrorist is simply \r\na terrorist.\r\nIn the same way, let me say that a blow was struck \r\nagainst democracy when the coup took place in Egypt. \r\n13-48656 3/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nWe therefore welcome the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to convene a summit on climate change, and \r\nhope that it will result in a strong political consensus \r\nfor addressing this paramount challenge of our time.\r\nWe welcome the observance of 2014 as the \r\nInternational Year of Small Island Developing States, \r\nand call on the international community to seize the \r\nchance to take a serious approach to meaningfully \r\nassist such States, in particular in relation to building \r\nresilience and disaster risk management. To that end, \r\na special fund must be established and made easily \r\naccessible.\r\nIn setting the stage for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, we believe that we should intensify efforts \r\nto eradicate poverty. The United Nations must not \r\nallow that objective to be lost among the many other \r\ndemands that exist. The United Nations also has a role \r\nto play in ensuring that the poorer, smaller developing \r\ncountries are not always put at a disadvantage at the \r\nlevel of international economic discourse and action. \r\nIt is critical that this body pursue and encourage \r\nmultilateral approaches to international and global \r\nproblems. Experience has shown that even though \r\nthe multilateral approach is often slow, it is the only \r\napproach that can lead to lasting peace, democracy and \r\njustice in our world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Guyana \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Donald Rabindranauth Ramotar, President \r\nof the Republic of Guyana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Pohamba: Last week a heinous terrorist \r\nattack was perpetrated against the Republic of Kenya, \r\nWe have also slashed poverty by more than half. \r\nMoreover, according to the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations, we are one of the \r\nfew countries in the world that have not only reduced \r\npoverty but also improved nutrition. The eradication of \r\npoverty and the promotion of sustainable development \r\nmust become a key principle and objective of global \r\neconomic governance and a guidepost for the action of \r\ninternational financial and trade institutions.\r\nWhile I speak of these achievements, I would \r\nbe remiss if I did not point out the grave challenges \r\nconfronting us even as we seek to build on the \r\nfoundations that have already been laid. We in the \r\nCaribbean have experienced major setbacks due to the \r\ninternational economic and financial crises that started \r\nin North America and Europe. While it appears that \r\nthose two regions are emerging from the crises, the \r\neffects continue to be devastating in the Caribbean. \r\nEven as we continue to grapple with the effects of the \r\nfinancial crisis, we are now faced with the graduation \r\nand differentiation imposed by some of our international \r\npartners. \r\nWe are told that as middle-income countries, \r\nmeasured by per capita gross domestic product (GDP), \r\nwe are no longer entitled to concessionary financing. \r\nThis is a recipe for reversing the gains made over the \r\nyears of hard work and sacrifice. We call for a rethink \r\nof that position and urge that greater consideration \r\nbe given to the special vulnerabilities of our region, \r\nwhere a country can see its entire GDP wiped out by \r\na single hurricane or, as in our country in 2005, when \r\n60 per cent of its GDP was wiped out because of f loods. \r\nClearly what we need is increased cooperation with the \r\ninternational community and our development partners, \r\nand not less.\r\nAnother serious challenge to sustainable \r\ndevelopment is the impact of climate change. This is \r\neven more the case for small island developing States, \r\nwhich are represented in the Assembly. Some of them \r\nface an imminent passage to oblivion. Climate change is \r\nnot of our making but, sadly, as small island developing \r\nStates and low-lying coastal States, we remain the \r\nvictims of its most adverse impacts. Unfortunately, \r\ninstead of a reduction in the emissions of greenhouse \r\ngases, there has been a rise of nearly 50 per cent. This \r\nmarked failure to take decisive action poses a threat to \r\nall humankind. It is tragic that while we all know that \r\ndangers that lurk due to global warming and climate \r\nchange, we seem incapable of stopping ourselves. \r\n4/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nagenda should take into account the valid concerns \r\nand challenges faced by middle-income countries, \r\nsuch as access to grants and concessional funding for \r\ndevelopmental purposes. The post-2015 development \r\nagenda should also embrace the protection of \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, the rule of law \r\nand the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nI wish to emphasize that sustainable development \r\nrequires adequate and predictable financing at the local \r\nand international levels.\r\nNamibia is concerned about the conflict situations \r\nand growing instability in many parts of the world. \r\nWe welcome the signing of the Peace, Security and \r\nCooperation Framework for the Democratic Republic \r\nof Congo and the Region. Namibia urges all signatories \r\nto the Framework to work together in good faith \r\ntowards its full implementation. We commend the \r\nefforts of the Intervention Brigade to restore peace in \r\nthe eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and call on \r\nthe international community to give its full support to \r\nachieving the success of that important mission. We \r\nalso appeal to the international community to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the communities affected by \r\nthe conflict.\r\nNamibia welcomes the decision of Madagascar’s \r\nreformed special electoral court, paving the way for \r\nholding presidential and parliamentary elections there \r\nnext month. We call on the international community to \r\nprovide the financial, technical and logistical support \r\nnecessary for those elections to be successful.\r\nOur Government continues to support the efforts \r\nof the African Union (AU), through the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia, to stabilize the situation in Somalia.\r\nThe Southern African Development Community \r\nand AU election observer missions have declared \r\nthe harmonized elections that recently took place in \r\nZimbabwe to be free, peaceful and credible. In that \r\ncontext, Namibia calls for the unconditional lifting of \r\nall sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe.\r\nWe welcome the holding of democratic elections in \r\nMali and congratulate President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita \r\non his election. We commend the Economic Community \r\nof West African States and other international partners \r\nfor the leading role they have played in resolving the \r\ncrisis in that country.\r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate our steadfast \r\nsolidarity with the people of Cuba, who have endured \r\nresulting in the death and injury of dozens innocent \r\ncivilians as well as the destruction of property. We \r\ncondemn this senseless attack and express our fraternal \r\nsolidarity with the people of Kenya.\r\nThe theme for the sixty-eighth session is “The \r\npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. It \r\nechoes the words of the Preamble to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations: “to promote social progress and better \r\nstandards of life in larger freedom”. As leaders, we \r\nare therefore challenged to ensure that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda promotes sustainable development \r\nand a secure future for current and future generations.\r\nWhen the Millennium Summit adopted the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in 2000, it emphasized \r\nthe urgency of making the world a better place for all \r\nhumanity. That promise gave hope to millions who live \r\nin abject poverty and deprivation in many parts of the \r\nworld. As we approach the 2015 deadline, we should ask \r\nourselves whether we have lived up to the commitments \r\nthat we made in 2000. We believe that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda should be people-centred and \r\ninclusive, with a focus on the provision of health care, \r\neducation, food security and nutrition, energy, potable \r\nwater, gender equality and the empowerment of women, \r\nyoung people and people with disabilities.\r\nThe challenges of climate change and \r\nenvironmental conservation should continue to be \r\na focus of our attention. During the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in 2012, we \r\nmade commitments to create a new global partnership \r\ncharacterized by a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation \r\nand mutual accountability. The outcome document of the \r\nConference, entitled “The future we want” (resolution \r\n66/288, annex), identified poverty eradication as the \r\ngreatest global challenge facing the world today and an \r\nindispensable requirement for sustainable development.\r\nAs I speak, the eleventh session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Convention \r\nto Combat Desertification is about to conclude its \r\ndeliberations in our capital city, Windhoek. We \r\nbelieve that the outcome of the Conference will further \r\nstrengthen the Convention’s role in mitigating the \r\neffects of desertification and droughts, particularly on \r\nthe continent of Africa.\r\nWhile developing countries have made \r\ncommendable advances in the areas of social and \r\neconomic development, many challenges remain. \r\nNamibia holds the view that the post-2015 development \r\n13-48656 5/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Anastasiades: It is a great honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly for the first time in my \r\ncapacity as President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nWhile it is realistic and pragmatic to acknowledge \r\nthat in an anarchic international system the political \r\nand economic leverage and might of States, or even \r\nof international organizations, are asymmetric \r\nand unequal, one should never forget the founding \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the Organization, which \r\nwere formulated as a result of the traumatic historic \r\nexperiences of two world wars. \r\nBearing in mind the aim of promoting the \r\nfundamental United Nations principles, I would like to \r\nshare my deep concern regarding what is happening in \r\nvarious parts of the world, threatening the sovereignty of \r\nStates and regional and global stability through, among \r\nother things, acts of State violence, acts of terrorism, \r\nthe infringement and calling into question of sovereign \r\nrights enjoyed by States, the annexation of territories \r\nthrough the illegal use of force, the production and \r\nuse of weapons of mass destruction, the sponsoring \r\nand harbouring of secessionist or terrorist movements, \r\nreligious fundamentalism manifested through terrorist \r\nattacks, the forcible displacement of millions of people, \r\nand hunger and distress, which intensify migration \r\nf lows and create demographic changes.\r\nThese are but a few examples that bear out the \r\nneed to evaluate, through collective debate and self-\r\nassessment, whether the United Nations principles, \r\nvalues and methods have indeed contributed to what we \r\nhave all been hoping for — the maintenance of peace \r\nand security and respect for the fundamental freedoms \r\nand human rights of all people.\r\nI am not a romantic ideologist; quite the contrary, \r\nI am a pragmatic realist who acknowledges that in this \r\nimperfect world it is extremely difficult, even impossible, \r\nto expect the full and unquestioning implementation of \r\nUnited Nations principles and values. However, what \r\nis happening today risks overthrowing the current \r\nharsh conditions due to the illegal economic blockade \r\nimposed on their country. We once again call for the \r\nunconditional lifting of the embargo on Cuba.\r\nThe attainment of self-determination of peoples \r\nliving under foreign occupation is one of the principles \r\nthat this Organization was founded on. In that regard, \r\nwe reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Western \r\nSahara, and call for the implementation of the United \r\nNations settlement plan for that country. Similarly, we \r\ncall for the implementation of relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions on Palestine.\r\nNamibia condemns the use of chemical weapons \r\nagainst the civilian population in Syria, as confirmed \r\nby the United Nations inspectors. We welcome the \r\nagreement reached between the Russian Federation and \r\nthe United States of America to place Syrian chemical \r\nweapons under the control of the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons. We also support \r\nthe efforts of the Joint Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the League of Arab States to help the \r\nSyrian parties find a peaceful solution to the conflict \r\nin their country.\r\nThe process of reforming the United Nations system, \r\nespecially the Security Council, must be accelerated in \r\norder to make it representative and democratic.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly presents an \r\nhistoric opportunity for the international community to \r\ntake concrete steps to eradicate poverty and enhance \r\ninternational peace and security in order to create a \r\nworld free of want, as envisaged in the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Let us summon the necessary \r\npolitical will to act now.\r\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and \r\nassure you of the full support of my delegation.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Namibia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hifikepunye Pohamba, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\n6/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nThe reference made by the President of the Republic \r\nof Turkey, Mr. Abdullah Gül, in this very Hall (see \r\nA/68/PV.5) to the 2004 proposal that, through genuine \r\ndemocratic procedures, was not accepted by the vast \r\nmajority of Greek Cypriots for a number of substantive \r\nreasons, does not absolve Turkey from its obligations \r\nand responsibilities concerning the efforts to find a just \r\nsolution and does not truly reflect the realities on the \r\nground, as borne out by the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions.\r\nNonetheless, I welcome the decision of Turkey to \r\nrespond positively to my proposal to hold meetings with \r\nthe negotiator of the Greek Cypriot community. I hope, \r\nand at the same time expect, that this positive response \r\nwill be followed by practical and substantial steps and \r\nthe adoption of a constructive attitude, guided by good \r\nfaith, that will contribute effectively towards reaching \r\na settlement.\r\nIn that respect, it is my strong belief that it is of \r\nparamount significance that a dynamic impetus be \r\nlaunched, either before or even during the negotiating \r\nprocess, in order to restore the confidence of the people \r\nof Cyprus in the prospect of reaching a settlement. Such \r\nan impetus can be achieved only through the adoption \r\nof bold measures that are seen as game-changers and \r\nas creating a win-win situation, not only for both \r\ncommunities but also for all interested stakeholders.\r\nWith that in mind, I have submitted a package \r\nproposal that, among other things, includes the return \r\nof the ghost city of Famagusta to its lawful inhabitants, \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and in line \r\nwith Security Council resolution 550 (1984). The return \r\nof Famagusta, along with the evident advantage of \r\nreviving the hope of the people of Cyprus, will also \r\nprovide a number of benefits. The infrastructural \r\nrestoration of a city that has been uninhabited for 39 \r\nyears will undoubtedly lead to the creation of new jobs \r\nin a wide variety of professional fields, providing a \r\nmajor boost to the economy of the country. At the same \r\ntime, by working together, building mutual trust and \r\nenjoying the results of joint collaboration, Greek and \r\nTurkish Cypriots will come closer to the realization of \r\nthe benefits of sharing together a prosperous future, \r\njust as we have done in the past.\r\nI believe that the Assembly shares my assessment \r\nthat this proposal, which is complementary to \r\nthe negotiating process, is to the benefit of both \r\ncommunities and that its acceptance would provide a \r\nmuch-needed stimulus to the prospect of reaching a \r\nworld order, calling into question the relevance and \r\neffectiveness of this international Organization.\r\nMr. Jerandi (Tunisia), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIt is not my intention to cast doubt on or minimize \r\nthe multidimensional contribution of the United Nations \r\nto a plethora of cases over the past seven decades. What \r\nis important is to enhance the Organization’s role and \r\nsafeguard the effectiveness of its decisions, as well \r\nas its actions. Should decisions or resolutions based \r\non international law condemning violations of human \r\nrights not be implemented or enforced, that could be \r\nseen as fostering or even rewarding arbitrariness. In \r\nthat case, regional differences and conflicts could be \r\nprolonged indefinitely, serving the petty interests and \r\nexpedience of their perpetrators at the expense of \r\ninternational law and our universal principles.\r\nI do not intend to enter into detail of what we are \r\nwitnessing and experiencing every day in different \r\nparts of the world. I will limit myself to the example \r\nof my own country, a small European country that has \r\nfor almost 40 years been violently divided, despite \r\nnumerous Security Council resolutions calling for its \r\nreunification and the withdrawal of the occupation \r\nforces.\r\nI take this opportunity to assure the General \r\nAssembly that, despite the current economic difficulties \r\nwe are facing, I am committed to working tirelessly \r\nand with determination to reach a viable and lasting \r\nsettlement so that all the communities of Cyprus may \r\nlive and thrive in a modern European country that fully \r\nrespects the values and principles of the United Nations \r\nand the European Union, safeguards the fundamental \r\nfreedoms and human rights of all its people, and \r\nensures their peaceful coexistence and prosperous \r\ncollaboration.\r\nAs I have already conveyed to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, it is my firm belief that the current status quo \r\nis unacceptable and that its prolongation would have \r\nfurther negative consequences for Greek and Turkish \r\nCypriots. Therefore, a comprehensive settlement is not \r\nonly desirable, but should not be further delayed. In \r\nthat respect, I wish, as a leader with a sincere vision \r\nof reuniting my country, to once more call on Turkey \r\nand our Cypriot compatriots to demonstrate the same \r\ndetermination and commitment and become partners in \r\nthe effort for the reunification of a peaceful, secure and \r\nprosperous homeland.\r\n13-48656 7/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nA recent and most encouraging development in our \r\narea is taking place in the field of energy cooperation. \r\nThe very promising potential of hydrocarbon \r\nexploration in the Levantine basin requires that all \r\ncountries in the region work closely together, bilaterally \r\nand regionally. Pertinent to that and a testament to our \r\nconstructive role in the region is the fact that Cyprus \r\nhas assumed a leading role in bringing neighbouring \r\nhydrocarbon-producing countries together, seeking \r\nopportunities not only for maritime boundary \r\nagreements, but also for joint efforts in exploring those \r\nhydrocarbon resources. Energy, in my opinion, should \r\nbe not a source of conflict, but a catalyst for conflict \r\nresolution and regional integration.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals framework \r\nhas galvanized unparalleled development efforts and \r\nguided global and national development priorities since \r\n2000. While three of the eight Goals have been achieved \r\nprior to the final deadline, much work remains to be \r\ndone ahead of 2015. With only two years left, enhanced \r\ncommitment, resources and efforts are needed, as is a \r\ncoordinated and integrated approach that can contribute \r\nto accelerating progress towards the achievement of all \r\nthe Millennium Goals.\r\nAs a small island State facing particular challenges, \r\nwe understand well why the coherence of all processes \r\nleading to a single and universal post-2015 development \r\nagenda is crucial. New and emerging asymmetric \r\nchallenges — such as climate change and natural \r\ndisasters, terrorism, inequalities and the necessity for \r\nthe prevalence of the rule of law, democracy and human \r\nrights — require renewed and collective commitment \r\nand an effective target-oriented post-2015 framework \r\nwith poverty eradication and sustainable development \r\nat its heart.\r\nAs the Secretary-General says in his report entitled \r\n“A life of dignity for all: accelerating progress towards \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and advancing the \r\nUnited Nations development agenda beyond 2015”, \r\n“the world’s quest for dignity, peace, prosperity, \r\njustice, sustainability and an end to poverty has \r\nreached an unprecedented moment of urgency” \r\n(A/68/202, para. 1)  “and the world’s nations must \r\nunite behind a common programme to act on those \r\naspirations” (ibid., para. 120).\r\nCyprus strongly subscribes to the joint efforts in \r\nfulfilling this task.\r\nsettlement. At the same time, in order to avoid entering \r\ninto a new frustrating negotiating process, the time for \r\nthe start of the negotiations is not as important as that \r\nthey be conducted in a comprehensive manner with \r\nclear substance, aims and targets. \r\nTo that end, I consider it essential that, before the \r\nstart of the negotiating process, it be clearly established \r\nthat the basis and solution to be reached will adhere \r\nto the relevant United Nations resolutions, the high-\r\nlevel agreements and the evolving transformation of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus into a bi-zonal, bi-communal \r\nfederal State with a single international personality, \r\nsingle sovereignty and single citizenship. Moreover, \r\nthe settlement must embody our capacity as a European \r\nUnion (EU) member State and fully enshrine its \r\nvalues and principles by enhancing the role of the EU \r\nin the negotiating process. I have to clarify that such \r\na role played by the European Union would merely \r\nsupplement and complement the United Nations good \r\noffices mission in order to guarantee not only our \r\neffective and efficient participation in the European \r\nUnion, through the proper implementation of the \r\nacquis communautaire, but also the restoration of the \r\nfundamental freedoms and human rights of all Cypriots.\r\nLast but not least, an important humanitarian \r\naspect of the Cyprus problem is the issue of missing \r\npersons. We salute the progress achieved so far. The \r\nissue must be resolved as soon as possible, regardless \r\nof the developments in the negotiations.\r\nThe positive and stabilizing role that Cyprus can \r\nassume in the eastern Mediterranean — especially \r\nin the areas of combatting terrorism, fighting the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance —has in the past \r\nfew months received extensive recognition. Keeping \r\nCyprus peaceful and stable and maintaining its \r\nconstructive regional role is a primary objective of my \r\nGovernment. We have proven that we are a reliable \r\nand interconnecting bridge between Europe, North \r\nAfrica and the Near and Middle Easts — in terms of \r\nboth perception and actions — as well as a credible \r\nand stable country that gives true credence to being \r\na safe haven. That has been demonstrated in practice \r\nseveral times during periods of massive humanitarian \r\nevacuations. We stand ready once more, if it is deemed \r\nnecessary — and hopefully it will not be — to contribute \r\nin a substantive manner to any international call to \r\nprovide humanitarian aid and facilities to the nationals \r\nof any third country.\r\n8/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nMahama, President of the Republic of Ghana, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mahama: It is with a heavy heart that \r\nI address the Assembly today. Just before I left Ghana \r\nto attend this general debate, I learned of the terrorist \r\nattack that took place in Nairobi. I was shocked and \r\ndeeply saddened to hear of the many lives that were lost \r\nto those senseless and cowardly acts of violence. As the \r\ndeath toll increased, so too did my grief, knowing that \r\neach additional number symbolized one more human \r\nlife. Those numbers symbolized individuals who \r\nmay have been strangers to those of us here but were \r\nof prime significance in the lives of the people who \r\nloved them — their parents, children, husbands, wives, \r\nfriends and colleagues.\r\nSoon enough, I got word that one of the people \r\nmassacred was a person of significance in my life \r\nand in the lives of so many other Ghanaians. Kofi \r\nAwoonor was a 78-year-old gentleman who had served \r\nhis country loyally as a poet and professor, ambassador \r\nto Brazil and Cuba, and Chairman of our Council of \r\nState, a presidential advisory body. Professor Awoonor \r\nhad once even been our country’s envoy to the United \r\nNations. On this fateful day, however, Professor \r\nAwoonor was in Nairobi to perform his poetry at a \r\nwriters’ conference. He had travelled there with his \r\nson, and they had decided before the day’s scheduled \r\nevents to do what should have been one of the most \r\nordinary and uneventful of activities — to make a stop \r\nat a shopping mall.\r\nUnfortunately, what happened that day at the \r\nWestgate Premier Shopping Mall was anything but \r\nordinary. Professor Awoonor’s life was taken from \r\nhim and those who loved him, just as the lives of \r\ndozens of others were taken away from them and their \r\ncommunities. Each of them had a unique story and \r\naccomplishments or aspirations for which they will \r\nbe remembered. Professor Awoonor’s son, though \r\ninjured, was among the many who were lucky enough \r\nto escape the attack. It is a day they will never forget. \r\nThey will carry the scars, physical and emotional, with \r\nthem. We who watched from a distance should never \r\nallow ourselves to forget, because we have also been \r\nirrevocably marked by this tragedy.\r\nWhen independence was upon us and our \r\npossibilities felt endless, the world saw how brightly \r\nAfrica could shine. Then, for decades, that light was \r\ndimmed. There was a time when killing seemed almost \r\nA few months ago, my country received \r\nunprecedented international attention because of \r\nthe economic crisis. I am proud to say that, due to \r\nthe persistence, determination and resilience of the \r\npeople of Cyprus, we are rising to the challenge and \r\nwill soon lead our country to the path of recovery and \r\ngrowth. My political vision is for Cyprus to receive \r\ninternational attention yet again, but this time for all \r\nthe right reasons.\r\nThis points to an end in the long-standing \r\nanachronistic division of my country, in line with \r\nthe aspirations of our people, especially the younger \r\ngenerations, to coexist peacefully in a European \r\ncountry that fully respects their fundamental human \r\nrights and freedoms. I am certain that all will agree \r\nthat the reunification is in the interests not only of the \r\npeople of Cyprus, but also of the entire international \r\ncommunity, since a solution to the Cyprus problem \r\nwill undoubtedly have a very important spillover effect \r\non efforts to achieve a much-needed environment of \r\nstability, security and peace in our region.\r\nFor our part, we are determined to rise to the \r\nchallenge of this historic responsibility and do our \r\nutmost with the aim of providing a more stable, \r\nprosperous and conciliatory future in our immediate \r\nregion, so that our legacy is remembered by generations \r\nto come.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Cyprus for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. John Dramani Mahama, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. John Dramani \r\n13-48656 9/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nbout with terror, Mali made a solid return to democracy \r\nby conducting an election that all observers, even the \r\nsceptics and the cynics, hailed as being free, fair and \r\npeaceful.\r\nWest Africa has seen enough war and strife. We \r\nwant peace and security to persist in our subregion. \r\nGhana will continue to play its role in strengthening the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States to make \r\nsure that it is able to meet that objective.\r\nWith all that I have said in my statement today, I \r\nam sure it will not come as a surprise to anyone that \r\nGhana enthusiastically threw its support behind the \r\nArms Trade Treaty adopted by the General Assembly \r\nat the sixty-seventh session. International trade in \r\nconventional arms and ammunition must be regulated. \r\nWe like to mention how the world has become a global \r\nvillage, especially when speaking of technology, culture \r\nand travel. The ease of communication in that global \r\nvillage also exists for warmongers and terrorist groups, \r\nwho are using it to recruit new members, expand their \r\ncells, create intercontinental networks, obtain weapons \r\nand conceal their identities and locations. If we are to \r\nfight back, we must also work cooperatively. Nations in \r\nthe developed world must align themselves with nations \r\nin the developing world. We must form partnerships \r\nand work together. Ghana is prepared to do that. We \r\nhave signed the Arms Trade Treaty and we intend to do \r\neverything possible to see that it is ratified in a timely \r\nmanner.\r\nFledgling democracies tend to be fragile. Their \r\nlimits are still being tested; their characteristics are \r\nstill being defined. Democracy is not a one-size-fits-all \r\nventure, nor is it a one-time event. It is a system that \r\ntakes decades to build, a process that pushes a country \r\ntowards a perfection it will never reach, but countries \r\nmust try nonetheless. This past year, the limits of \r\nGhana’s democracy were tested, and I am proud to \r\nreport that we passed with f lying colours. \r\nThe results of our recent elections were contested. \r\nSince our return to constitutional rule, Ghana has \r\nconducted six successful elections. Last year’s elections \r\nwere the first whose results were formally challenged \r\nand heard by the Supreme Court. What made that \r\nsituation noteworthy was the reliance of all parties \r\ninvolved on the rule of law. The proceedings were \r\ntelevised for the sake of transparency. The verdicts were \r\nreadily accepted, and there was not a single reported \r\nincident of violence.\r\ncommonplace in Africa. Indeed, there are plenty of \r\ngraves that remain unmarked. There was a time when \r\nthe ruthlessness of dictators seemed to be the order of the \r\nday. For decades, the corruption, greed and depravity of \r\na few caused the suffering of an entire continent. We so \r\neasily could have succumbed to the wars, the poverty \r\nand the diseases, but we did not. We staggered our way \r\nthrough, year after year, and eventually we made it. We \r\nhave survived. \r\nLast year when I addressed the General Assembly \r\n(see A/67/PV.9), I began with the assurance that I had \r\ncome with good news from Ghana, with stories of \r\nsuccess from the African continent. This year, it gives \r\nme great pleasure to do the same — even on the heels \r\nof the dastardly terrorist attack — because I know \r\nthat today’s Africa will not be divided or deterred by \r\nthe heinous crimes of those who wish to disrupt our \r\nprogress. I know that our borders will no longer be \r\nused to undermine the brotherhood and sisterhood of \r\nour citizens. \r\nThe days of massacres must remain in our past. \r\nOur rivers will no longer run red. Our children must be \r\nstudents now; we will no longer allow their childhoods \r\nto be stolen from them by those who wish to turn them \r\ninto soldiers. Africa is standing tall, walking confidently \r\ntowards political stability, walking confidently towards \r\neconomic prosperity, walking proudly towards ethnic \r\nand religious harmony and coexistence. There is no \r\nplace in today’s Africa for hatred and intolerance and \r\nthe murder of innocent people — not anymore, not ever \r\nagain. So we will mourn our dead. We will console \r\nourselves and each other through our grief. We cannot \r\nallow terror to defeat us. That must strengthen our \r\nresolve. Our stride will not be broken.\r\nLast year from this stage, I also declared Ghana’s \r\nresolve to be a beacon of peace and democracy in the \r\nWest African subregion. On behalf of the citizens whom \r\nI serve, I promised the world that Ghana would not \r\nallow its territory to be used in any manner whatsoever \r\nto destabilize other nations. Ghana has been steadfast \r\nin its cooperation with its regional neighbours to \r\nmaintain the security of those nations that are enjoying \r\nstability and to restore security to those, such as \r\nCôte d’Ivoire and Mali, that have recently emerged \r\nfrom turmoil. Currently, Côte d’Ivoire is in a stage of \r\nrebuilding. The recent overtures towards reconciliation \r\nmade by President Ouattara are a major step towards \r\nbridging the country’s political divide. After its own \r\n10/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\ntowards creating an integrated bauxite and aluminium \r\nindustry in Ghana.\r\nIn that way, by keeping the concept of value at the \r\nforefront of our economy, we can create new jobs for \r\nour young people. We can do that with local and foreign \r\ninvestors who share our vision. Often the rest of the \r\nworld wrongly assumes that we in Africa do not know \r\nour worth. But we do. It is not sympathy we want; it is \r\npartnership — and the ability to stand on our own feet. \r\nIt is not handouts we are in search of; it is opportunities. \r\nWe have already shown that with time and the right \r\nopportunity, Africa can make it.\r\nGhana achieved the Millennium Development Goal \r\n(MDG) targets for reducing poverty and hunger far \r\nahead of the scheduled date of 2015. We are on track for \r\nachieving MDGs 2, 3, and 6 as well. School enrolment, \r\ngender parity and the reduction of HIV/AIDS have \r\nall seen dramatic progress and statistical shifts as a \r\nresult of the work to reach our targets. While we are \r\nlagging behind in MDGs 4, 5, and 7 — infant mortality, \r\nmaternal health and environmental sustainability — the \r\nfigures show that there has been a vast improvement. \r\nSince 2000, the number of maternal deaths for every \r\n100,000 births has decreased by more than half, from \r\n740 to 320. We recognize that when we are talking \r\nabout human lives, even a 50 per cent decrease is too \r\nlittle; it is not enough. That is why in 2010 we launched \r\nthe MDG Accelerated Framework and Country Action \r\nPlan.\r\nWomen account for more than 50 per cent of \r\nGhana’s population. We believe that empowering them \r\nthrough education and encouraging them to take full \r\ncontrol of their reproductive rights will help us not only \r\nto attain the MDGs faster, but also to build a better \r\nnation. It is not enough to put girls in school and allow \r\nthem just enough education to be deemed literate; we \r\nmust keep them in school. Removing teenaged girls \r\nfrom school for any reason, let alone to marry them off, \r\nis an unacceptable practice that must end. \r\nAfrican women have always been the backbone \r\nof our societies. Let us imagine the change they could \r\neffect in our countries if we would only help them to \r\nreach their full potential. As a President and a father, I \r\nowe it to my children — my sons and my daughter — and \r\nall the children of Ghana to create a country where \r\nthey may walk with their dignity intact and heads held \r\nhigh, standing shoulder to shoulder with the children of \r\nEurope, South America, Asia, North America and the \r\nrest of the world.\r\nGhana’s victory is not an aberration. Other \r\ncountries, like Kenya, have had similar experiences. \r\nThat indicates that democratic institutions in Africa are \r\ngrowing stronger. It indicates that the balance of power \r\nin African countries is shifting from the authority of a \r\nsole individual to the more equitable process of properly \r\ndesigned systems. Strong institutions are the hallmark \r\nof every nation’s stability. They are crucial tools in the \r\nfight for human rights.\r\nIt is our intention to bring an end to youth \r\nunemployment. In Ghana today, we are about to launch \r\nthe Youth Jobs and Enterprise Development Fund, \r\na programme that will provide young people with \r\nentrepreneurial skills and access to the funds needed \r\nto establish businesses of their own or expand existing \r\nones, thereby creating new employment opportunities \r\nfor themselves. \r\nSix of the ten fastest growing economies in the \r\nworld today are on the African continent. However, \r\nthat growth has not yet been translated into sustainable \r\nemployment opportunities. Over the course of the past \r\ndecade, African economies created over 37 million \r\nwage-paying jobs, yet 63 per cent of workers remain \r\ntrapped in low-paying subsistence or self-employment \r\nendeavours. With those realities come the very real \r\npossibilities of income instability, exclusion from \r\nthe benefits of economic growth and social security \r\nbenefits tied to formal sector employment.\r\nAfrica has a fast-growing population, more than \r\n50 per cent of which is below the age of 35. That means \r\nwe must create more jobs for our growing numbers of \r\nyouth. They must have opportunities available to them. \r\nWe cannot do that unless we transform the economies \r\nof Africa. It all comes down to value. We must value \r\nour resources, including our human resource — we \r\nmust value our people. \r\nWe cannot continue to be exporters of raw materials \r\nand primary produce. We need to add value to our \r\nexports. We cannot continue to export raw cocoa beans \r\nin Ghana; what we need to do instead is process more \r\nof those beans into value-added products. We cannot \r\ncontinue to export unrefined gold; we need to add value \r\nto our gold exports. We cannot continue to export oil \r\nand gas; we need to integrate that industry into our \r\neconomy; we need to process petroleum products and \r\nproduce power with the gas. We cannot continue to \r\nexport bauxite and then in return import alumina to \r\nfeed our local aluminium smelter; we need to work \r\n13-48656 11/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj \r\nTsakhia, President of Mongolia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Tsakhia: Allow me to first congratulate \r\nMr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on assuming \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at this session. \r\nMongolia pledges its full support to him.\r\nWe gather here at the United Nations to collectively \r\nassess the state of the world, share our thoughts and our \r\nvision, and agree on common actions. I shall begin by \r\nreviewing where we are today. \r\nOver 70 million people around the world join the \r\nmiddle class each year. The Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) have improved the lives of billions of \r\npeople. The world has attained poverty-reduction \r\ntargets — in some places, even ahead of the proscribed \r\ndeadline. Rather than seeing 2015 as the end, we should \r\nview it as the beginning of a new era. In this era, we \r\nshould build on our successes, attend to gaps and meet \r\nemerging challenges.\r\nSadly, we face many such challenges. Today, over \r\n200 million people are jobless, over 50 million children \r\nare not in school, and one in eight of our fellow citizens \r\nstill goes hungry. Yet over $900 billion dollars are \r\nearmarked for military expenditures every year. Only \r\na fraction of that sum is spent on health care and \r\neducation. Such a state of affairs should not be tolerated.\r\nWhen it comes to the climate, a temperature \r\nincrease of more than two degrees Centigrade would \r\nbe disastrous, if not catastrophic. Our environment \r\nis changing rapidly. On the production side, global \r\nconsumption far exceeds our fragile planet’s capacity. \r\nResources are being exhausted. Humankind is gravely \r\nendangered. We are running out of time. The world has \r\ntoo many hungry people, too much violence and too \r\nlittle commitment to human rights. We need to change \r\nthat.\r\nI want to share with the Assembly Mongolia’s \r\nviews and experience. Mongolia is a great nation with a \r\nrich history. It is an old nation with a young heart. We \r\nare fortunate to have abundant natural resources, which \r\noffer great growth prospects and a unique opportunity \r\nfor economic development and social progress. With \r\ndouble-digit percentage growth, we are one of the \r\nworld’s fastest developing economies.\r\nMongolia has achieved many development goals \r\nin areas such as universal primary education, reducing \r\nGhana is encouraged by the new initiative to resolve \r\nthe Israeli-Palestinian issue. We are still firm in our \r\nbelief that an independent Palestinian State, existing \r\nside by side with a peaceful and secure Israeli State, \r\nis a desirable outcome that we must all support and \r\nwork towards. In working towards that goal, we must \r\nrealize that the continuous construction of settlements \r\nin Palestinian territory increasingly shuts the door on a \r\ntwo-State solution.\r\nGhana calls once again for the embargo against \r\nCuba to be lifted. It is a relic of the Cold War era and \r\nhas no place in our current global dispensation.\r\nWe have come a long way since the end of the last \r\nglobal war, yet the makeup of the Security Council \r\ndoes not reflect those developments. Ghana therefore \r\nsupports the reform of the Security Council.\r\nGhana will continue to pursue the principle of \r\nconstructive engagement in our relations with the \r\nother countries in the world. We are fully committed \r\nto promoting honest global partnership that is informed \r\nby mutual respect and reciprocity.\r\nIn closing, I would like once again to pay my \r\nrespects to those who have lost their lives in Kenya, \r\nSyria, Palestine, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria, \r\nMali, Somalia, Turkey, India, the United States and all \r\nthe other places where terrorists have attacked just this \r\nyear alone. The reason we are all gathered here today is \r\nto find the ways and the means to create a better, more \r\npeaceful and prosperous world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President  \r\nof Mongolia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nMongolia.\r\nMr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\n12/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\ntransparently. Citizens deserve access to information \r\nand a say in how their communities are developed. \r\nThe best Government is the one based on strong civic \r\nparticipation.\r\nMongolia believes in democratic development. Over \r\n20 years ago, it was unimaginable that Mongolia would \r\none day chair the Community of Democracies. That \r\nwell-known and highly respected global democratic \r\nmovement is dedicated to promoting freedom and \r\ndemocracy. Hundreds of human rights activists and \r\ndemocratic leaders from many countries gathered in \r\nUlaanbaatar last April. The Ulaanbaatar Declaration \r\ncharts a future course for promoting democracy. Our \r\ninitiative, the Asia Democracy Network, and the \r\nministerial consultative meeting, have laid a solid \r\nfoundation for democratic development.\r\nI believe that efforts to foster civic engagement \r\nare more effective with democracy education. The \r\nimplementation of resolution 67/18, on education for \r\ndemocracy, will strengthen democratic institutions \r\nand improve the human rights situation for more of our \r\nfellow citizens, because knowledge is power.\r\nWe all must focus on promoting human rights. In \r\nthe past two decades, Mongolia has been learning and \r\nadvancing democracy at home. With a view to supporting \r\nemerging democracies, we initiated and established an \r\ninternational cooperation fund and have already started \r\nimplementing several projects. We are actively sharing \r\nthe lessons of parliamentary democracy and conducting \r\nlegal reform with Kyrgyzstan. We organized training \r\nfor diplomats and public servants from Afghanistan. \r\nWe are also discussing the possibility of cooperation \r\nwith Myanmar and other emerging democracies.\r\nI call on Member States to support our policy of \r\nprotecting and promoting democratic governance \r\nand human rights. I humbly ask for States’ support of \r\nMongolia’s candidature for the Human Rights Council \r\nin the elections to be held in 2015.\r\nPeace and security remain a fundamental human \r\nright.\r\nToday people the world over are distressed by \r\nendless cycles of conflict. Military forces and weapons \r\nare being used to settle disputes. Thousands of human \r\nbeings are losing their lives, millions are displaced and \r\nmany more are suffering. The grave situation in Syria \r\nis the latest example. We hope that the United States-\r\nRussian initiative will bear fruit and lead to a peaceful \r\nresolution of the Syrian conflict.\r\nchild mortality and improving maternal health. \r\nHowever, our fifth national MDG progress report \r\nsuggests that more needs to be done. To reach our \r\ndevelopment goals, the Government is working closely \r\nwith all national stakeholders, including political \r\nparties, the private sector, research institutions, civil \r\nsociety and the media. Likewise, we invite investors \r\nto work together for our common interests. Just a \r\nfew days ago, we hosted the World Economic Forum \r\nStrategic Dialogue on the Future of Mongolia. That \r\nevent gathered representatives of multiple stakeholders \r\nto explore future economic pathways for my country’s \r\ndevelopment.\r\nMongolians care deeply for the environment. We \r\ntake seriously our shared responsibility to confront the \r\nthreat from climate change. That is why we are promoting \r\na green development policy. We have also created and \r\npreserved national parks to curb desertification. At the \r\nsame time, these scenic parks form the backbone of \r\nnew ecotourism. They will generate both conservation \r\nincome and green jobs.\r\nMy country is creating an Asian super-network \r\nfor green development. It will produce renewable \r\nenergy and provide it to Asian consumers. Mongolia’s \r\nfirst wind farm, which is privately owned, is now in \r\noperation. Wind energy has the potential to produce \r\nelectricity well beyond the country’s needs.\r\nWe face many environmental challenges, including \r\nland degradation, deforestation, natural disasters and \r\npollution. Those issues need to be resolved urgently \r\nand collectively. Environmental education and wider \r\npublic participation are vital to resolving those \r\nchallenges. This year we hosted the United Nations \r\nWorld Environment Day. Indeed, we are at the centre of \r\nthe green economy. The Mongolian people, particularly \r\nour young people, are committed to building a better \r\nenvironmental future.\r\nLast year I spoke of the importance of Mongolia’s \r\nbattle to root out corruption at all levels. We are combating \r\ncorruption — the scourge of democracy — with a zero-\r\ntolerance policy at every level of Government. As a \r\nresult, Mongolia moved up 26 places in Transparency \r\nInternational’s rankings of States.\r\nTransparency is the key to fighting corruption. \r\nCitizens have the right to know how their taxes are spent \r\nat every level of Government, from national agencies to \r\nthe local administration. Our “glass account” system \r\nensures that all funds are accounted for openly and \r\n13-48656 13/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nWhere there is transparency, there is less economic \r\ndisparity and greater accountability.\r\nWhere citizens are engaged and informed, good \r\nthings happen. We must be fearless in our efforts to \r\npromote and achieve a fair, open and transparent world \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Mongolia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Borut Pahor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Borut Pahor, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Borut Pahor, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Slovenia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Pahor: I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. John Ashe on his election and wish him every \r\nsuccess. Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon and thank him for his tireless efforts \r\nand leadership in promoting the ideals and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe ideal and principle to which we should aspire \r\nis creating a world in which everyone can live free from \r\nfear, free from want and in dignity. The United Nations \r\nhas achieved many extraordinary successes in the past, \r\nbut we also have to acknowledge some disappointing \r\nand frustrating setbacks and failures. I believe that now \r\nmore than ever, the United Nations must play a major \r\nrole in international relations. We live at a time when \r\nthe balance of global power is changing in a rapid and \r\ndramatic way. Thus far in history, this kind of global \r\nchange has never ended without a global conflict. We \r\nestablished the United Nations precisely in order to \r\nprevent such a conflict in future.\r\nLess than 20 years ago, we witnessed events that \r\nshocked our human conscience: genocide in Rwanda, \r\nMongolia firmly supports non-proliferation and the \r\ncomplete elimination of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nWe cannot tolerate the use of chemical weapons and \r\nstrongly condemn any violation of universally accepted \r\ninternational law. \r\nThis morning I participated in the High-level \r\nMeeting on Nuclear Disarmament (see A/68/PV.11). \r\nAs a country with internationally recognized nuclear-\r\nweapon-free-status, uniquely situated between two \r\nnuclear-weapon States that are permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council, Mongolia has been working hard \r\non nuclear disarmament and the non-proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nAs a result of our efforts, the five nuclear-weapon \r\nStates, permanent members of the Security Council, \r\nhave issued a joint declaration recognizing Mongolia’s \r\nunique status. They pledged to respect that status and \r\nnot to contribute to any act that would violate it. Their \r\njoint commitment ensures that we will not be used as \r\na pawn in any future nuclear plans or strategies. That \r\nis Mongolia’s contribution to greater confidence and \r\nstability in the region.\r\nStrengthening peace and stability in North-East \r\nAsia is one of Mongolia’s national security priorities. \r\nWe firmly believe that dialogue and open discussions \r\nfoster confidence. We have therefore put forth an \r\ninitiative: the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on North-East \r\nAsia Security. We invite the other States of the region \r\nto jointly address various issues of common interest, \r\nincluding security issues in North-East Asia.\r\nMongolian military officers and troops are \r\nhonoured to serve along with their fellow United \r\nNations peacekeepers to maintain international peace \r\nand security. We are very proud of our peacekeepers \r\nfor their dedicated service and their invaluable \r\ncontributions to the cause of peace.\r\nWe all know the complexity of contemporary \r\nconflicts. Our peacekeepers are serving in areas \r\nwith high security threats and risks. To support and \r\nencourage our peacekeepers, last February I took a trip \r\nto South Sudan and visited the United Nations Mission \r\nthere. During my visit, I met the President of South \r\nSudan and offered my support to him and to his nation, \r\nthe youngest member of the international community.\r\nLet us make our world safer and more prosperous. \r\nLet us be fearless when it comes to fighting for fairness, \r\ntransparency and the rule of law. Where there is the rule \r\nof law, there is less corruption and more human rights. \r\n14/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nwitnessed too many divisions in the Council, which have \r\nimpeded its ability to act in a timely manner. Decisive \r\nprogress in Security Council reform is required to \r\nimprove the Council’s efficiency, transparency and \r\naccountability. As part of that effort, the permanent \r\nmembers should consider refraining from the use of the \r\nveto in situations of genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nand serious violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw.\r\nWe call upon the Security Council to refer the \r\nsituation in Syria to the International Criminal Court. \r\nThe International Criminal Court is an essential pillar \r\nin the system of international justice and a powerful \r\ntool to ensure accountability and to fight against \r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes. It deserves our \r\nfull support.\r\nWe must focus more closely on addressing the \r\nroot causes of conflicts and expand our work on \r\nprevention. In particular, we must improve our ability \r\nto read the warning signs and trigger early action. The \r\nconsequences of inaction far outweigh any risks that \r\nmight arise from timely prevention and response, in \r\nterms both of money and — more important — human \r\nsuffering and lives. \r\nThat was a lesson learned in our neighbouring \r\nregion, the Western Balkans. Enhancing mutual trust \r\nthrough open political dialogue is a prerequisite for \r\npeaceful coexistence and long-term stability there. \r\nSlovenia and Croatia have therefore launched the Brdo \r\nprocess as a forum for high-level dialogue intended \r\nto strengthen relations and reconciliation among the \r\ncountries of the region.\r\nThe past century was a very dark chapter in \r\nEurope and in human history. In August 2014, we will \r\ncommemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the \r\noutbreak of the First World War. It brought about mass \r\ndestruction of human life and new methods of warfare \r\nthat were subsequently condemned by the civilized \r\nworld. It was followed by the Second World War, and \r\nthe century ended with a decade of intra-State conflicts \r\nand genocides that caused untold human suffering. \r\nLet us use our conscience and humanity as the \r\nweapon of choice, for everyone deserves to live in \r\ndignity and peace, feeling safe, with access to food and \r\ndrinking water and with a decent job and adequate pay \r\nfor it. Yet something so obvious seems to be very far \r\nfrom reality. It is our task to bring reality closer to our \r\ndreams.\r\nfollowed by genocide in Srebrenica and Darfur. We \r\nshould have learned lasting lessons from those horrific \r\nevents. We vowed never to let that happen again. We \r\ncollectively endorsed the responsibility to protect \r\nhuman beings from mass atrocities and gross and \r\nsystematic violations of human rights, and yet we have \r\nfailed again. \r\nWe are faced with another human tragedy unfolding \r\nbefore our eyes in Syria. After more than two years of \r\nbrutal violence against civilians, including women and \r\nchildren, we still have not found a political solution \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations. Not only \r\nis the unconscionable use of chemical weapons in Syria \r\nconsidered a war crime, it is an assault against our \r\ncommon humanity. \r\nSovereignty as responsibility implies that States \r\nare responsible for the well-being of their citizens. It \r\ndoes not give them a licence to kill their own citizens. \r\nIf States manifestly fail to protect their populations, \r\nthe international community has a duty to react. When \r\nfaced with mass atrocities, indifference is not, and \r\ncannot represent, an option. The report of the United \r\nNations inspectors was clear, credible and impartial. \r\nThe United States-Russian agreement on the framework \r\nfor the elimination of Syrian chemical weapons must \r\nbe implemented without delay. Syria’s accession to the \r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, \r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \r\nand on Their Destruction is a positive step. Syria \r\nshould comply immediately and fully, or face the \r\nconsequences. \r\nIt is important that diplomacy prevailed and \r\nreferred the issue back to the United Nations and the \r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council should live up \r\nto its responsibility and use all appropriate measures \r\nto comprehensively address the situation in Syria. \r\nReaching a political settlement remains the only \r\nviable and lasting solution to the crisis and to ensuring \r\nstability in the region. We support the timely convening \r\nof the “Geneva II” conference.\r\nThe Security Council has the primary responsibility \r\nto maintain international peace and security under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. It exercises that \r\nresponsibility on behalf of all of us. It has an obligation \r\nto deliver and to fulfil the mandate entrusted to it by \r\nthe international community. In this period of tensions \r\nand challenges, the responsibility of the major Member \r\nStates is especially great. In recent years we have \r\n13-48656 15/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\njourney and a future project leading towards further \r\nhorizons. What we must take into consideration is the \r\nelement of time. Nations require decades to gain control \r\nof their revolutions and achieve their success or failure. \r\nWe must remember that the Arab Spring, like all human \r\nprojects, may stumble or come to a standstill — indeed, \r\nmay fail. Our duty — the duty of those here — is to \r\npersist in support of that journey and to begin afresh \r\nafter each obstacle. \r\nWe believe that the difficulties involved in \r\nbuilding democracy in the Arab Spring countries are \r\nonly natural and will be overcome. Our peoples will \r\nnever accept regimes that shackle them. We want \r\nto fight extremism cloaked in religion, not replace it \r\nwith dictatorship cloaked in nationalism or patriotism. \r\nThose difficulties do indeed reveal that political, social \r\nand ideological forces are pushing countries this way \r\nand that; building democracy and civil institutions is \r\nreplete with difficulties in all Arab Spring countries.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to speak to the \r\ncurrent authorities in Egypt and call on them to release \r\nPresident Mohammed Morsi and all political detainees. \r\nOnly a bold initiative such as that has the potential to \r\nend the political tensions, stop the violence and bring \r\nall the parties back to a dialogue as the only means to \r\nsolve all the difficult problems caused by the current \r\ntransitional phase.\r\nThe restriction of movement of goods and persons is \r\nincreasing the difficulties faced by the struggling people \r\nof Gaza under Israeli occupation and colonization.\r\nTunisia is dealing with three challenges. That \r\nof terrorism, as exemplified by the killing of the two \r\nmartyrs, Shukri Belaid on 6 February and Mohamed \r\nBrahimi on 25 July, is a major political challenge that \r\nhas impeded the work on the Constitutional Council. \r\nThe second is the fact of slowing domestic and foreign \r\ninvestment. The third is that we are having to learn \r\ndemocracy at the same time that we are building and \r\ndefending it. It has not yet taken root in our political \r\nand social traditions or our general culture. In \r\nTunisia we have many of the elements necessary for \r\nsuccess — a responsible and conscious political class \r\nthat has continued to pursue dialogue, a legitimate, \r\ndisciplined and professional army and a people who \r\nare peaceful and politically aware and who understand \r\nwhat is in their own interests.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that the Arab \r\nSpring in Tunisia will continue and succeed. We \r\nToday’s world leaders have a unique opportunity, \r\npossibility and responsibility to influence our \r\ncommon future for many decades to come. That is \r\nwhy it is important not to lose focus on the successful \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby 2015 and to agree on the post-2015 agenda. Let us \r\ntransform our vision of saving future generations from \r\nthe scourge of war into reality. We have no time to \r\nspare. We have no right to fail.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Borut Pahor, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Moncef \r\nMarzouki, President of the Republic of Tunisia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Mohamed Moncef Marzouki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mohamed \r\nMoncef Marzouki, President of the Republic of Tunisia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Marzouki (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof my country, Tunisia, and the Tunisian people, \r\nI greet the Assembly and all those around the world \r\nrepresented here.\r\nOn 17 December 2010, Tunisia, as the Assembly \r\nknows, was the first country to experience the Arab \r\nSpring, the peaceful revolutions of Arab peoples \r\naimed at ridding themselves of corrupt dictatorships \r\nhampering the economic, political and social progress \r\nof their countries. Such dictatorships had imposed with \r\nbrutal force corrupt regimes that had swept away basic \r\nhuman civilization. What has now been seen in some \r\nArab Spring countries may lead some to believe that \r\nthose efforts at liberation have failed and that the dream \r\nhas become a nightmare.\r\nWhat we must remember is that the Arab Spring \r\nis not a final stage, something that can be achieved \r\novernight. It is, rather, just the beginning of a liberation \r\n16/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nto protecting people against dictatorships, particularly \r\nthe Syrian dictatorship, which is an extreme example of \r\nhow immorally a regime can behave.\r\nWe are fully confident that had the Court been able \r\nto act, the Syrian regime would not have attempted to \r\nturn the presidency of the country into rule-by-heredity, \r\nlimiting ruling to one party only. It would not have \r\ndared to convict members of opposition political parties \r\nand sentence them to death. Imagine if the Court had \r\nbeen able to act in such cases. What if the Court had \r\nbeen able to pursue a course in favour of human rights? \r\nImagine how we could have avoided the nightmare that \r\nthe Syrian people has been going through — 100,000 \r\ndead and 7 million displaced persons, with a regime \r\nkilling men, women and children with all the weapons \r\nat its disposal, including chemical weapons. \r\nHave we ever seen such a brutal regime by an \r\nindividual person who came to power through force \r\nand falsification and who is fighting a barbarous civil \r\nwar that has set the stage for ugly scenes beyond any \r\never seen in the history of the region? The regime ought \r\nto be brought to the ICC. Justice delayed still cannot \r\nbring millions of dead back to life. There have to be \r\npreventive bodies that can take up such situations from \r\ntheir very beginning. \r\nRegimes like that of Syria cannot last long \r\nagainst internal democratic opposition and the lack of \r\ninternational recognition. Tunisia therefore calls on all \r\ndemocratic States that wish to build institutions that \r\ncounter the rise of dictatorships to support our project. \r\nWe believe that such a constitutional court would be the \r\nexpression of a new spirit needed by the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are meeting in this place with all the nations \r\nof the world to review the world’s problems, many of \r\nwhich are foreseeable and bring great pain to people. \r\nWe would have been able to avoid such situations had \r\nwe adopted the slogan “Think globally and act locally.” \r\nAs a medical doctor, I would recall that we were \r\nable to conquer epidemics that raged against humankind \r\nthrough efforts at prevention. Dictatorships, climate \r\nchange and poverty must be thwarted internally and \r\namong peoples. In facing such epidemics, we must have \r\npreventive policies that save humankind. We hope to \r\nGod that there is enough time for us to quickly take \r\nsuch a direction before it is too late.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nwill set a date for elections and will agree on a just \r\nGovernment. Those elections will be supervised by the \r\nUnited Nations, the League of Arab States, the African \r\nUnion and all other relevant international and local \r\norganizations and civil society groups. God willing, \r\nthey will be held next spring. We are aware that the \r\nforces of terrorism and chaos will try to destabilize \r\nthem as much as possible. Tunisia is undertaking this \r\nexperiment both for itself and for the rest of the world. \r\nWe want our revolution to be peaceful. We want \r\njustice to play its role in the transitional period. We \r\nalso want to expand the concept of democracy. It is \r\nnot merely about the rights of those winning 51 per \r\ncent of the vote, and ignoring those who won 49 per \r\ncent. We want coalition Governments that take into \r\nconsideration the fact that society is made up of many \r\nparts. We want to learn from one another. Our success \r\nor failure will have consequences that will reach far \r\nbeyond our borders. Hence the importance of solidarity \r\namong peoples, so that we can ensure success for this \r\nunique experiment.\r\nToday the Arab Spring has encountered the ultimate \r\nexpression of suffering in Syria. The violence that has \r\nfaced peaceful demonstrations has shocked us from the \r\nbeginning. It is escalating day after day, and is now brutal \r\non a scale that history has seldom seen before. In Tunisia \r\nwe have taken a strong position against the dictatorship \r\nin Syria. We supported the the struggle of the Syrian \r\nopposition and expelled the regime’s ambassador from \r\nour country. We have been warning for a long time now \r\nabout the problems of the militarization of the events, \r\nof factionalism, sectarianism and outside intervention, \r\nwhether by States or so-called jihadi groups, including \r\nsome from Tunisia, which we know will be a danger to \r\nus when they return from that suffering country.\r\nWe have always called for a peaceful solution and \r\nhave gone so far as to say that life is more important \r\nthan justice, and if it is necessary not to prosecute the \r\nSyrian dictators — and if they leave the scene — we \r\nshould accept that situation, however bitter. Our fears \r\nhave become reality, however, and we continue to \r\nlive with this nightmare that is aff licting the valiant \r\nSyrian people, as well as our conscience. We have \r\nnever seen such a pitch of brutality and barbarity. A \r\npolitical solution to end the nightmare is desperately \r\nneeded. However, what we also need is the support of \r\nthe General Assembly for prosecuting the case through \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). That would be \r\na contribution to international law that could contribute \r\n13-48656 17/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nsanctions send a message to those who are producing \r\nweapons and not jobs, who violate human rights and \r\nuse national resources to satisfy individual interests \r\nand not those of their society as a whole. But the use of \r\neconomic, energy or information tools to show power \r\nor set up zones of influence is unjustifiable, especially \r\nfor the future.\r\nThe twenty-first century should be the age of \r\nsolidarity, equality and sustainable development. It \r\ncannot be an age of the f launting of power, zero-sum \r\ngames or buffer zones. Those times are over. Any attempt \r\nto return to those times impedes the development of the \r\nmodern world. But, regrettably, power games still exist.\r\nI would like to share my country’s and region’s \r\nexperience with the Assembly. In the past two decades, \r\nthe Baltic States have been rapidly transformed. Complex \r\nand painful economic, political and social reforms \r\nhave boosted economic growth, social well-being and \r\npolitical stability. After rebuilding our statehood two \r\ndecades ago and with the help, advice and experience \r\nof the international community, our nations have today \r\nbecome donors and have a lot of experience to share \r\nwith those who are going through transformations \r\nsimilar to the ones we have experienced. \r\nInner resolve and consensus are very important. \r\nHowever, a favourable external climate and \r\ninternational support are also needed, especially for \r\nsmall countries that depend on larger players for their \r\ntrade, transportation or energy links.\r\nMr. Corlăţean (Romania), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIn two months’ time, in Vilnius, several Eastern \r\nEuropean countries intend to confirm their commitment \r\nto completing the painful but much-needed reforms \r\nfor economic growth, political stability and social \r\nharmony. For many years, those countries worked \r\nhard to reach national agreement on reforms, their \r\nscope and direction. They learned from their mistakes \r\nand mobilized resources to build their own futures. \r\nThey chose to build modern States of the twenty-first \r\ncentury — open, transparent and collaborative, not \r\ndominating.\r\nIt was not easy for those countries to decide which \r\ncourse to take. Their choice would have been made easier \r\nif their free will had been respected and their decision \r\nsupported in good faith, and with encouragement by \r\nthose who could provide such support. Instead, they \r\nare now facing trade restrictions, bans on goods, the \r\nof the Republic of Tunisia for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Mohamed Moncef Marzouki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Dalia \r\nGrybauskaitė, President of the Republic of Lithuania, \r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grybauskaitė: There are two years left \r\nuntil the deadline for achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is therefore time to review what \r\nwe have succeeded in achieving and set the guidelines \r\nfor the work that remains.\r\nDevelopment is a global challenge. Every \r\ncontribution that is made, every experience that we \r\nshare and every lesson that we have learned is very \r\nimportant for all of us. By sharing we set the stage for \r\nlearning from each other — and not only from our own \r\nmistakes. In today’s world, every country has the right \r\nto choose a path that best suits its experience, culture \r\nand needs, as long as it does not infringe upon the rights \r\nof others and guarantees human rights and freedoms. \r\nThe international community has an obligation to \r\noffer support based on the principles of ownership and \r\nempowerment so that those choices may be realized.\r\nDevelopment cannot be imposed; it must be \r\npromoted. But it is not only about development. It is \r\nabout free choice, democracy and fundamental rights, \r\neach of which is key to the success of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. \r\nToday we live in the twenty-first century, but there \r\nare still those who want to enforce a specific course \r\nof development on others, using economic pressure, \r\nenergy levers or cybertools, by distorted information \r\nor threats. It is true that internationally approved \r\n18/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nguide our deliberations on the many challenges that \r\nthe world faces today. Also, allow me to commend His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić for his excellent leadership \r\nduring the sixty-seventh session.\r\nThe President knows better than most the unique \r\ncombination of challenges faced by small island \r\ndeveloping States. We are being battered from all sides, \r\nboth literally and figuratively. Over the past decade, we \r\nhave faced a f lood of crises with a genesis far from our \r\nshores that have stretched our capacity to protect and \r\nimprove the health and prosperity of our people.\r\nThe near collapse of the global financial system \r\nand spikes in food and energy prices have caused \r\nenormous difficulties for our small and vulnerable \r\neconomy. A severe drought caused additional hardship \r\nand foreshadowed the much more difficult future we \r\nwill face in a warming world. At the same time, the \r\nf low of official development assistance and climate \r\nfinancing have begun to stagnate.\r\nThankfully, we are presented with an unprecedented \r\nopportunity over the next few years to transform \r\nhow the international system supports sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We will be continuing work on a number \r\nof important processes over the next year., They include \r\nthe crafting of sustainable development goals and the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, the work of the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development \r\nand — of particular importance to my country — the \r\nproceedings of the third Global Conference on the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates. In addition, we must make rapid progress \r\ntowards a new climate-change agreement in 2015, \r\nwhich will obviously have enormous implications for \r\nthe sustainable development prospects of small islands. \r\nWe must work in a coordinated fashion so that those \r\nprocesses are mutually reinforcing and deliver concrete \r\nresults, rather than produce the usual rhetoric. It will be \r\na challenge, but under the President’s skilled leadership, \r\nI am confident we can succeed.\r\nHowever, I fear we will come up short of our \r\nambitions for transformational change if we shy away \r\nfrom making fundamental reforms in the way the global \r\neconomy works. We began a promising conversation \r\non the matter back in 2008 when the financial crisis \r\nwas still fresh in our minds, but as stock prices have \r\nrebounded, our attention has wandered. Let us not \r\nforget that most of the problems that caused the previous \r\ncrisis have not been fixed. Those same problems also \r\nmanipulation of energy prices, the use of pressure and \r\nopen disrespect displayed in information forums.\r\nThe countries of the European Union Eastern \r\nPartnership are not the only ones experiencing such \r\nproblems. Even Lithuania, which holds the presidency \r\nof the Council of the European Union and has \r\nsuccessfully consolidated its course of development, is \r\nunder similar pressure. Barriers to travel, unreasonable \r\ndelays in cargo transportation, the milk wars — those \r\nare just a few very recent controversial examples. For \r\nnations, the decision is really difficult to make when free \r\nchoice means being threatened with gas-price increases \r\nand blocked trade, instead of receiving support and \r\nadvice. Under such pressure, it is hard to implement \r\nreforms that empower members of society and open up \r\nopportunities to engage in the state-building process.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda must provide \r\ninstruments that empower States to seek development, \r\nbased on free will and their individual needs. There is no \r\nplace for forced choices, open threats or demonstrations \r\nof power. The international community, especially the \r\nUnited Nations, should empower States to realize such \r\nself-determination. I urge us all to give the matter our \r\nvery careful attention.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania for the statement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNauru.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Waqa: May I first congratulate Mr. John \r\nAshe on his election to the presidency at the current \r\nsession. I am sure that his wisdom and experience will \r\n13-48656 19/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nstep must be to bring more transparency and democratic \r\noversight to economic governance. The most important \r\ndecisions are not made in universal bodies, such as the \r\nGeneral Assembly, but rather far away from the small, \r\nthe isolated and the vulnerable. Is it any surprise that \r\nthe system has failed to meet our needs?To address that \r\nproblem, we should start by relaunching the discussion \r\non global economic governance here in the General \r\nAssembly, as well as by reforming the governance of \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, so that they are more \r\ninclusive.\r\nThe systemic barriers to sustainable development \r\nare formidable, but that has not stopped Nauru \r\nfrom seeking practical solutions that can be readily \r\nimplemented in the short term. An example is the \r\nrecently completed Nauru case study on climate change \r\nfinancing. The study identified a number of steps my \r\nGovernment and our development partners can take to \r\nmake official development assistance more effective. \r\nFor example, project-based financing was found to be \r\nmarkedly less effective than more f lexible modalities, \r\nsuch as general budgetary support.\r\nAnother key finding concerned the need for \r\ndomestic institution-building. Accessing many sources \r\nof multilateral finance is, quite frankly, beyond the \r\ncapacity of my Government, and the traditional \r\nstrategy of conducting regional workshops has simply \r\nnot worked. We hope to collaborate with development \r\npartners to design sustained programmes with a \r\nsignificant in-country component, so that there is a \r\ndurable transfer of the skills necessary to benefit from \r\ninternational support mechanisms.\r\nNauru has also made its best efforts to contribute at \r\nthe international level. We have the tremendous honour \r\nof presiding over the Alliance of Small Island States \r\n(AOSlS), a group that has been a leading advocate \r\nfor climate action for more than two decades. The \r\nupcoming nineteenth session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change (COP-19), to be held in Warsaw, \r\nwill be important to laying the foundation for an \r\nambitious agreement in 2015. A key priority for the \r\nCOP-19 will be jump-starting near-term mitigation \r\naction through the launch of a process guided by more \r\ntechnical expertise and focused on energy efficiency \r\nand renewable energy. AOSIS has proposed a very \r\npractical and collaborative approach to rapidly scale \r\nup the implementation of policies and the deployment \r\nof technologies that not only reduce greenhouse gas \r\nundermine sustainable development in many countries \r\nand communities around the world.\r\nIn 2009, the Commission of Experts on Reforms \r\nof the International Monetary and Financial System \r\nsubmitted a report (A/63/838) to this body in which it \r\nindicated that finance, which should be the servant of \r\nthe economy, had been promoted to be its master. The \r\nrules of economic governance had been increasingly \r\nwritten to serve the interests of a shrinking few as they \r\npursued risky ventures — ventures that often played \r\nhavoc with people’s lives and livelihoods. We are \r\nvery familiar with some of the results of that system: \r\nstock-market bubbles, currency bubbles and property \r\nbubbles. When they burst, they leave behind enormous \r\nhardship. Even worse, investments in risky activities of \r\nthat type compete with more productive investments in \r\nbasic infrastructure, renewable energy, health services \r\nand the like — investments that contribute to true \r\nsustainable development.\r\nOur reckless inaction is demonstrated by the \r\ninflation of the latest bubble: the carbon bubble. At \r\nleast two thirds of known fossil fuel reserves cannot be \r\nburned if we are to limit the rise in global temperatures \r\nto below two degrees. The cost of renewable energy has \r\nfallen considerably in the past decade. By any measure, \r\nfossil fuels are a very bad long-term investment, yet \r\nthat has not prevented trillions of dollars in private \r\ninvestment and fossil fuel subsidies from pouring into \r\nnew infrastructure for the exploration, extraction and \r\nconsumption of fossil fuels.\r\nThe size of the recent housing bubble has been \r\nestimated at $4 trillion. The carbon bubble could be \r\nmore than five times larger. That should be an issue of \r\nserious international concern. How do we allow trillions \r\nof dollars to f low into destructive activities while the \r\nmost basic needs of millions go unmet? The reasons are \r\ncomplicated, but make no mistake that this is a choice. \r\nIt is a choice made by international policymakers to \r\nprioritize profits over people.\r\nAs the President said earlier this week, “it is \r\ntime for us to concede that our efforts at reforming \r\nand revitalizing our Organization need new impetus” \r\n(A/68/PV.5, p. 5). Reclaiming the global economic \r\nsystem and putting it to work for the good of the people \r\nwill be a long and difficult process, but it may be the \r\nonly way to reach our sustainable development goals.\r\nThe Commission’s 2009 report made many good \r\nrecommendations for our consideration, and the first \r\n20/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nwe have only the vaguest idea of what an international \r\nresponse to those effects would look like. That needs to \r\nchange. We must start preparing for the challenges that \r\nlie ahead. As the Secretary-General said at the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \r\n“We must strengthen the interface between science and \r\npolicy”. \r\nThe world’s attention is now focused on the \r\nimmense suffering in Syria. On behalf of the people \r\nof Nauru, I would like to offer my condolences to the \r\nmillions of people whose lives have been affected by \r\nthe Syrian conflict. We are horrified by the scale of \r\nhuman atrocity there. I am compelled to ask: Do we \r\nalways have to wait for well over 100,000 people to \r\nbe killed before we can find solutions to restore peace \r\nand security? As the President observed, the mandate \r\nof this body has limitations, and we cannot issue \r\nresolutions that bind countries. The United Nations \r\ninvests enormous power in the hands of a tiny minority \r\nof five, which is not so different from global economic \r\ngovernance being dictated primarily by eight.\r\nNauru is always striving to improve bilateral \r\nrelations. I would like to express my gratitude to \r\nAustralia, which has always been an important partner.\r\nWe look forward to our continued work with the new \r\nGovernment as we continue to collaborate on joint \r\nprojects that are delivering important benefits in my \r\ncountry.\r\nNauru is gratified to note that, with solid \r\ninternational support and cross-Strait rapprochement, \r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan has increased its \r\nmeaningful participation in United Nations specialized \r\nagencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage \r\nthe positive interaction between the two sides of the \r\nTaiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore, \r\nI would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan \r\nhas made to helping my country make progress towards \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We also express \r\nour gratitude to the Governments of New Zealand, the \r\nRussian Federation, Japan, the Republic of Korea and \r\nIndia; they are all invaluable partners in our joint effort \r\nto bring sustainable development to my island.\r\nAs the President of the General Assembly aptly \r\ndescribed in his opening statement, setting the stage \r\nfor sustainable development will require introspection, \r\nfrank discussion and coming to terms with some hard \r\ntruths about the nature of the challenges we face and \r\nthe institutions we have at hand to respond. Only by \r\nemissions but also advance domestic sustainable \r\ndevelopment priorities. In the view of AOSIS, that \r\ntechnical process can prepare the ground for a much \r\nmore ambitious post-2020 agreement.\r\nThe proposal in no way relieves developed \r\ncountries of their international obligation to take the \r\nlead in addressing climate change. They should be held \r\naccountable for fully implementing best practices to \r\nreduce their own emissions, while also providing the \r\nmeans for implementing adaptation and mitigation \r\nactions in developing countries. The AOSlS proposal \r\nindicates the way to accomplish those objectives. \r\nEstablishing an international mechanism to address \r\nloss and damage is also a key priority for AOSlS, as is \r\nmobilizing climate financing and making sure the Green \r\nClimate Fund is ready to accept donor contributions in \r\n2014.\r\nClimate change is the greatest challenge to the \r\nsustainable development of small islands. We must \r\ncome to terms with the fact that, owing to our delay, \r\nsome grave impacts are now unavoidable. Some will \r\nhave security implications. Addressing the security \r\nimplications of climate change remains a key priority \r\nfor Nauru and the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates. I would like to reiterate our proposals for \r\nmoving forward.\r\nFirst, we are calling for the appointment of a \r\nspecial representative on climate and security to help \r\nexpand our understanding of the security dimensions \r\nof climate change. The special representative would \r\nregularly report to the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council on emerging climate-related security \r\nthreats and would facilitate regional cooperation on \r\ncross-border issues. Vulnerable developing countries in \r\nparticular could benefit from a special representative \r\nequipped to help them evaluate their security situations \r\nand develop action plans to increase the resilience \r\nof their institutions. At some point in the future, the \r\nspecial representative could become an invaluable \r\nasset in preventive diplomacy efforts and post-conflict \r\nsituations.\r\nSecondly, we are requesting the Secretary-General \r\nto lead a joint task force of all the relevant organs and \r\nspecialized agencies to immediately assess the capacity \r\nand resources of the United Nations system to respond \r\nto the anticipated security implications of climate \r\nchange. We have heard in countless forums about the \r\npotentially destabilizing effects of climate change, yet \r\n13-48656 21/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\ncooperation, should lead in promoting the envisaged \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThirteen years ago, our global efforts were \r\nmobilized behind the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nWe now have less than 1,000 days in which to meet \r\nthose targets. Our review and stocktaking exercise \r\nreveals that, while there have been some significant \r\nachievements, there are still gaps and unevenness in the \r\nattainment of the Goals. \r\nIn the case of Zimbabwe, we have made progress \r\ntowards achieving universal access to primary education \r\nand combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \r\nHowever, some of the Goals are off track owing to \r\nlack of capacity — mainly financial capacity — and \r\nin some areas progress has stalled, including in those \r\nareas relating to the eradication of poverty and hunger, \r\nchild mortality, universal access to maternal and \r\nreproductive health, environmental sustainability and \r\naccess to potable water and sanitation. As a country, \r\nwe are committed to undertaking coordinated efforts to \r\naccelerate progress to complete the unfinished business \r\nof the MDGs in the remaining period leading up to 2015. \r\nAny goals that have not been achieved by then should \r\nbe integrated into the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nZimbabwe fully shares and supports the emerging \r\nconsensus that eradicating poverty in all its dimensions \r\nshould be the overarching goal of our post-2015 \r\nagenda. Eradicating poverty by 2030 may be an \r\nambitious goal, but it is attainable if we mobilize our \r\ncollective efforts. Building on the foundation of the \r\nMDGs, the post-2015 agenda should go beyond the \r\nsocial development agenda of the MDGs and achieve \r\nstructural transformation in our economies that delivers \r\ninclusive and sustainable growth. We expect a shift \r\nthat will bring about industrialization, decent jobs and \r\nqualitative change to the lives of our citizens. We are \r\ndetermined to modernize our infrastructure and ensure \r\naccess to sustainable energy for all, food security and \r\nnutrition. However, we recognize that we cannot do that \r\nin isolation from other partners.\r\nIn the same vein, we also support calls to prioritize \r\ngender equality, the health-related MDGs, education \r\nand environmental sustainability in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, among other issues. Those are \r\ncritical matters in our quest to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all our people.\r\nThe lofty objectives of the Charter of the United \r\nNations in the economic arena will remain unfulfilled \r\ncorrectly diagnosing the problems and choosing the \r\nappropriate tools to begin our work will we be able to \r\nreach satisfactory outcomes that benefit us all. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert G. Mugabe, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Let me begin by extending my \r\nwarmest congratulations to Mr. John William Ashe on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-eighth session. His election to that esteemed \r\noffice is a fitting tribute to the personal and diplomatic \r\nqualities that he has exhibited over the years.\r\nThroughout the world, peace and development have \r\nremained dominant themes of our times. People all over \r\nthe world have been raising their voices in favour of \r\npeace, development and cooperation, and against war, \r\npoverty and confrontation. Here at the United Nations \r\nwe all acknowledge that peace, security, development \r\nand human rights are the pillars of the United Nations \r\nsystem and the cornerstones of our collective well-\r\nbeing.\r\nIn that regard, the theme for this session, “The \r\npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is \r\nquite pertinent and timely, as it gives fresh impetus to \r\nour understanding that achieving the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), and mapping the way \r\nforward beyond 2015 requires our collective efforts. \r\nThe United Nations, as the centre for international \r\n22/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nprotecting civilians, NATO forces were deployed with \r\nan undeclared mission to eliminate Al-Qadhafi and his \r\nfamily. A similar campaign was undertaken in Iraq by \r\nthe Bush and Blair forces under the guise of eradicating \r\nweapons of mass destruction, which Saddam Hussein \r\nnever possessed.\r\nWe appreciate the central role that the United \r\nNations should play in furthering multilateralism in \r\npreference to unilateralism. In that regard, we applaud \r\nthe consultations and negotiations on the eventual \r\ndestruction of the chemical weapons in Syria. My \r\ncountry expresses its gratitude and appreciation to \r\nRussia and China for their principled stand on Syria. \r\nWe hope and trust that the Syrian people will soon sit \r\nin dialogue to discuss peace and desirable political \r\nreforms. Those Western countries in pursuit of \r\nhegemony as they pretend to be advocates of democracy \r\nmust be resisted.\r\nFor Africa, the reform of the Security Council \r\nis especially long overdue. The anachronistic and \r\nunrepresentative character of the Council must be \r\nredressed. For how long should Africa continue to be \r\ndenied the right to play a pivotal role in the Security \r\nCouncil as it decides measures on conflicts within \r\nthe borders of that very continent? The Security \r\nCouncil needs to be more representative, democratic, \r\ntransparent, accountable and accessible to the wider \r\nmembership for its decisions to have greater legitimacy. \r\nAfrica’s case for the correction of the glaring historical \r\ninjustice of being unrepresented in the permanent \r\ncategory and underrepresented in the non-permanent \r\ncategory has been made through the clear, fair and well \r\narticulated Ezulwini Consensus. Zimbabwe remains \r\nsteadfast in its support of the Ezulwini Consensus, \r\nwhich is, in fact, a demand.\r\nZimbabwe strongly condemns the use of unilateral \r\neconomic sanctions as a foreign policy tool to effect \r\nregime change. The illegal economic sanctions imposed \r\non Zimbabwe by the United States and the European \r\nUnion violate fundamental principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations on State sovereignty and the \r\nnon-interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign \r\nState. Moreover, those illegal sanctions continue to \r\ninflict economic deprivation and human suffering on all \r\nZimbabweans. In the eyes of our people, the sanctions \r\nconstitute a form of hostility and violence against them \r\nfor the simple crime of undertaking the land reform \r\nprogramme by which land was put in the hands of the \r\nthen majority landless Zimbabweans. Our small and \r\nunless all Member States join in efforts, genuinely \r\nand seriously, to address challenges that developing \r\ncountries face in their pursuit of development, \r\nincluding meeting the MDGs. It is therefore imperative \r\nthat our discussions address what has so far been the \r\nweakest link, namely, the means of implementation. It \r\nmust be understood that, in addition to national efforts, \r\nsubstantial international support and an enabling \r\ninternational economic environment are essential if the \r\nMDGs are to be achieved by 2015, especially in Africa. \r\nIt is therefore important to fulfil the commitments \r\nmade to support Africa in various international forums. \r\nThe United Nations should track the fulfilment of those \r\ncommitments.\r\nZimbabwe supports the reform of the United \r\nNations to strengthen its central role in promoting \r\nmultilateralism and to be effective in tackling current \r\nand future global challenges. We are convinced that \r\nreform would strengthen the Organization’s capacity \r\nto fully promote and implement the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter and improve its democratic \r\ndecision-making.\r\nIn that regard, the reforms in the economic \r\nand social actions of the United Nations remain of \r\nfundamental importance to us. Our firm belief in \r\nmultilateral cooperation means that we place a premium \r\nin the ability of the United Nations system to deliver \r\nefficient development cooperation. The democratic \r\ntransformation of the architecture of the international \r\nfinancial system is essential, as is a root-and-branch \r\nreform of the international trading system. The terms \r\nof trade have hugely burdened developing countries for \r\ntoo long.\r\nZimbabwe supports the ongoing efforts to \r\nrevitalize the General Assembly, which is the most \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. We believe \r\nthat the Assembly should take the lead in setting the \r\nglobal agenda and restore its primacy, which has over \r\nthe years been encroached upon by other organs. We \r\ncannot accept situations whereby the Security Council is \r\nincreasingly encroaching upon issues that traditionally \r\nfall within the General Assembly’s purview and \r\ncompetence, including in the area of norm-setting. \r\nRecent events have revealed that the formal decisions of \r\nthe Security Council have provided camouflage to neo-\r\nimperialist forces of aggression seeking to militarily \r\nintervene in smaller countries in order to effect regime \r\nchange and acquire complete control of their wealth. \r\nThat was the case in Libya, where, in the name of \r\n13-48656 23/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nAddress by Mr. Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guatemala\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGuatemala.\r\nMr. Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Otto Fernando Pérez \r\nMolina, President of the Republic of Guatemala, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Pérez Molina (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to begin my remarks by welcoming Mr. John Ashe \r\nin his capacity as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. We are pleased that a \r\nrepresentative of our region, Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, is once again presiding over the main \r\norgan of the United Nations. At the same time, I wish \r\nto express my appreciation to Mr. Vuk Jeremić for his \r\noutstanding leadership and stewardship of the Assembly \r\nat its previous session, during which he honoured us \r\nwith a visit to Guatemala.\r\nThe year 2013 has been challenging for Guatemala. \r\nLast year we undertook to reduce our levels of child \r\nmalnutrition, which affects 4 of every 10 children in \r\nmy country. In addition, we decided that we could \r\nnot continue to sit on our hands while hundreds of \r\nthose children died of hunger. I am here to inform the \r\nAssembly, with some optimism, that our efforts are \r\nbeginning to bear fruit. Since we began the fight against \r\nhunger, we have managed to reduce infant mortality \r\nfrom malnutrition by 50 per cent. Similarly, we have \r\ncreated a monitoring system that allows us to measure \r\nthe nutritional condition of hundreds of thousands of \r\nchildren, both to assess their growth and development \r\nand to prevent deaths among children under the age \r\nof 5. The challenge is enormous and we know that our \r\ngoals are very ambitious. That is why we are not yet \r\nsatisfied with the progress achieved, but we can affirm \r\nwithout hesitation that little by little we are winning the \r\nfight against hunger and child malnutrition.\r\nThe fight against hunger is closely related to \r\neducation. We want our boys and girls to study as many \r\nyears as they can and wish, and with no less than nine \r\nyears of basic education, which is the goal we have set. \r\npeaceful country is threatened daily by covetous and \r\nbigoted big Powers whose hunger for domination and \r\ncontrol over other nations and their resources knows \r\nno bounds.\r\nShame, shame, shame, we say to the United \r\nStates of America. Shame, shame, shame, we say to \r\nBritain and its allies, who have continued to impose \r\nillegal sanctions on our people. Zimbabwe is for \r\nZimbabweans; so are its ample resources. I ask those \r\ncountries to please remove their illegal and iniquitous \r\nsanctions from my peaceful nation. If those sanctions \r\nwere intended to effect regime change, well, the results \r\nof the recent national elections have clearly shown them \r\nthat they cannot achieve their agenda.\r\nWe are preached to daily by the West on the \r\nvirtues of democracy and freedom, which they do not \r\nentirely espouse. Zimbabwe took up arms precisely \r\nto achieve freedom and democracy. There was none \r\nduring colonialism, and it was British colonialism, for \r\nthat matter. Yet we have been punished by the United \r\nStates through the odious Zimbabwe Democracy and \r\nEconomic Recovery Act, which it enacted in 2001 to \r\neffect regime change in our country. Now that malicious \r\nintent to continue with the relentless persecution of our \r\nsmall, peaceful country has shown itself again, through \r\nthe rejection by the United States of the recent and \r\nabsolutely democratic and fair results of our general \r\nelections of 31 July, even as they were applauded by the \r\nAfrican Union and all our regional organizations. \r\nIt appears that when the United States and its allies \r\nspeak of democracy and freedom they do so in relative \r\nterms. Zimbabwe, however, refuses to accept that those \r\nWestern detractors have the right to define democracy \r\nand freedom for it. We made the greatest sacrifice and \r\npaid the ultimate price for freedom and independence \r\nin Zimbabwe, and we remain determined never to \r\nrelinquish our sovereignty, as at the same time we \r\nremain masters of our destiny. As we have repeatedly \r\nand loudly said and asserted, Zimbabwe will never be \r\na colony again.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert G. Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n24/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nThat integration is a fact, and we Governments must \r\nstrengthening the institutions and policies that make it \r\npossible to make best use of the achievements of our \r\nchildren, our citizens and our business community.\r\nThe quest for prosperity is also related to our goals \r\nof promoting peace and combating impunity. Security \r\nhas been a challenge inherited by my Government, and \r\nwe have resolved to address it by preventing violence \r\nand by enforcing the law in a clear framework of respect \r\nfor human rights. We are far from having achieved our \r\ngoals, but the progress made shows that our State has \r\nthe capacity to dismantle large criminal networks and \r\nto make them accountable to justice for their actions. \r\nIn that regard, I should like to inform the Assembly \r\nthat in urban areas of Guatemala City, where homicide, \r\nextortion and insecurity were prevalent, we have \r\nmanaged gradually to reinstate peace and social \r\ncoexistence. At the same time, our justice institutions \r\nreport that overall, impunity has been reduced by \r\nalmost 25 per cent between 2009 and 2013, with a \r\nparticular decrease in impunity for crimes against life, \r\nboth homicide and sexual crimes against women and \r\nchildren.\r\nIn connection with the strengthening of the rule of \r\nlaw, I would like to thank the General Assembly and \r\nthe donor community in particular for their support \r\nfor the International Commission against Impunity \r\nin Guatemala. Its mandate has been renewed until \r\nSeptember 2015, and we hope that this period will be \r\nused well to continue strengthening the capacity to \r\nprosecute of the Public Prosecutor, the Ministry of \r\nSecurity, the Ministry of the Interior, the national civil \r\npolice and the courts.\r\nBuilding a country that is prosperous and free of \r\nhunger, a country integrated with its neighbours and \r\nwhere justice and peace prevail – that is the standard \r\nthat will guide us, and those are the goals that will \r\nmove us forward. That is why we ask the international \r\ncommunity to support us in moving in that direction.\r\nSince my Government took office last year, we \r\nhave clearly affirmed that the war against drugs has \r\nnot yielded the desired results and that we cannot \r\ncontinue doing the same thing and expecting different \r\nresults. That is why I associate myself at this time with \r\nother countries that have spoken out in the Assembly, \r\nincluding Mexico, Colombia and Costa Rica, in stating \r\nthat in the face of the global drug problem, we must \r\nreview internationally agreed policies in the quest for \r\nBut for that to happen, we have to ensure that they have \r\nthe nutrition that will enable their brains and bodies \r\ngrow healthily. We have to nourish our boys and girls so \r\nthat they can study. And we must provide them with the \r\nopportunity of education so that they can be successful \r\nin their adult lives, both in the world of work and in the \r\ncivic responsibilities that our democracy needs.\r\nThat is clearly linked to our second goal, that of \r\npromoting dignified employment and a competitive \r\neconomy. I can again report to the Assembly that we \r\nhave achieved a 27 per cent increase in the number of \r\nworkers registered with Guatemala’s social security \r\nsystem between the first quarters of 2012 and 2013. \r\nThat means that our economy is creating more formal \r\nemployment opportunities at the same time as we are \r\nmaking progress in establishing our country as a leader \r\nin improving the business climate in order to stimulate \r\ninvestment. \r\nI am delighted to say that we have developed a \r\ngrowing dialogue in various fields with the President \r\nof the United Mexican States, Enrique Peña Nieto. We \r\nsee the future of Guatemala as clearly related to the \r\neconomy of that fraternal neighbouring State, and that \r\nis why we have been seeking to strengthen our relations \r\nin areas including energy, transport and logistics, the \r\nmodernization of customs and the improvement of \r\nsecurity at border crossings, as well as our common \r\nbattle against hunger and in favour of peace in our \r\ncountries. Shared prosperity is our banner, and justice \r\nour emblem.\r\nIn the same vein, we have expressed to the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America our clear \r\ninterest in aligning our policies with those that promote \r\nprogress and security between the peoples of Mexico \r\nand the United States. Guatemala aspires to a tripartite \r\nalliance of prosperity with Mexico and the United \r\nStates that would serve as the foundation for solid links \r\nwith the countries of the Central American Integration \r\nSystem and at the same time become a platform for \r\nprogress in the entire Caribbean region.\r\nAgain, we know that these are ambitious goals and \r\nthat reaching them will require a strong and persistent \r\neffort, so as to achieve the common future of prosperity \r\nthat our peoples demand - a demand that we cannot \r\nand should not evade. Today millions of Guatemalans \r\nand Central Americans live and work in the United \r\nStates, and more than 50 per cent of our population \r\ndepends directly on business transactions with and \r\nfamily remittances from Mexico and the United States. \r\n13-48656 25/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\ncontrol and, of course, respect for human rights. We \r\nalso believe it important that the special session be held \r\nhere in New York City, because of its significance for \r\nthe future of global policies on the drug problem.\r\nWe had the privilege of being elected to the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2012-2013. Now that we are only \r\na few months away from the end of our tenure, I would \r\nlike to say that we have taken the provisions of Article \r\n24 of the Charter of the United Nations very seriously, \r\nnot only in decisions based on our own values and \r\nprinciples but also taking into account the fact that we \r\nare acting on behalf of the General Assembly. We have \r\nstrived to comply with our mandate with objectivity, \r\na sense of responsibility and professionalism, while \r\nemphasizing security and justice and the protection of \r\nhuman rights and humanitarian law.\r\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, we have taken a position on the recent crisis \r\nin Syria. We condemned the massacre, with chemical \r\nweapons, of more than 1,000 people and insisted that \r\na crime of such magnitude could not go unpunished. \r\nWe also called for a firm response on the part of the \r\ninternational community in order to prevent any \r\nrepetition of such deplorable acts. Consistent with that \r\nposition, we have supported the leadership of President \r\nObama, who has clearly affirmed that peace in Syria \r\nand the Middle East as a whole must be built within the \r\nframework of a political and diplomatic dialogue, but \r\nwithout abandoning our international responsibility to \r\nprotect the citizens of those countries and of the world \r\nfrom the threat of nuclear and chemical weapons.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nWe also believe that the United Nations made a \r\nsingular contribution to humankind in 2000 when it \r\nlaunched the Millennium Development Goals. That is \r\nwhy we are actively participating in the design of the \r\ncontent and scope of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nas a catalyst for development. We particularly hope that \r\nthe international community will define the reduction \r\nof violence against women and children and universal \r\naccess to justice as global priorities. Only in a world that \r\nis free of violence against women and provides justice \r\nfor all can a path be cleared towards development based \r\non full respect for human rights.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by \r\ncongratulating the United Nations system once again on \r\nits ongoing efforts to seek peace and justice worldwide. \r\nGuatemala endorses the same goals, and it is with \r\nmore effective results in a framework of respect for \r\nhuman rights and from the perspective of health and \r\nharm reduction. The objective must be the well-being \r\nof society in all its aspects.\r\nPrevention must be given priority in order to reduce \r\nthe impact on health and especially to reduce the level of \r\nsocial violence that is associated with the drug problem. \r\nIn the same vein, international cooperation should be \r\nstrengthened so as to reduce illegal f lows of arms and \r\nthe funds that finance those criminal networks.\r\nThe new global strategy must emerge from an open \r\nand inclusive debate leading up to the special session of \r\nthe General Assembly scheduled for 2016. We welcome \r\nthe Declaration of Antigua Guatemala of the General \r\nAssembly of the Organization of American States as a \r\nfirst step in the right direction towards the 2016 session.\r\nI would like to add to this the specific views of my \r\nGovernment. I should first like to say that Guatemala \r\ncommends the visionary decision of the citizens of the \r\nstates of Colorado and Washington, which have led the \r\nway to an approach that addresses the issue of drugs \r\nfrom the perspective of public health, the prevention \r\nof addiction and violence, and full respect for human \r\nrights. Likewise, I wish to commend President Obama \r\nfor his wise decision to respect the voice of the citizens \r\nof Colorado and Washington, allowing those innovative \r\nundertakings to prove themselves over time.\r\nWe also respect and support the example set \r\nby President José Mujica of Uruguay in proposing \r\nlegislation that regulates the cannabis market instead \r\nof following the failed route of prohibition. I must also \r\nacknowledge the valiant and visionary leadership of \r\nthe Secretary-General of the Organization of American \r\nStates, José Miguel Insulza, who has firmly promoted \r\na climate of dialogue and reflection on drug policies \r\namong the Governments of the western hemisphere.\r\nWithout digressing from the path of international \r\ncooperation against transnational crime, each country \r\nmust experiment with new models to address the \r\ndrug problem. My Government has decided to create \r\na national commission that will help us explore more \r\neffective means of dealing with the consumption, \r\ntrafficking and production of drugs. \r\nWe hope that the special session of the General \r\nAssembly to be held in 2016 will draw on those \r\ninnovative experiences and take a strong stand in favour \r\nof public policy that can be evaluated objectively and is \r\nbased on a focus on public health, prevention, damage \r\n26/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nI assured the Assembly last year that our quest to raise \r\nPalestine’s status was not aimed at delegitimizing an \r\nexisting State, the State of Israel, but at consecrating — I \r\nrepeat, consecrating — the legitimacy of a State that \r\nshould exist, which is Palestine. I have also affirmed \r\nbefore the Assembly that our quest was not intended to \r\naffect the peace process, nor is it a substitute for serious \r\nnegotiations. On the contrary, our quest is supportive of \r\nthe choice of peace and has revived a process that was, \r\nin truth, moribund. As we have repeatedly affirmed and \r\nproved in practice, the State of Palestine, which abides \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy, will exercise its role and \r\nuphold its responsibilities within the international \r\nsystem in a positive and constructive manner that \r\nreinforces peace.\r\nA new round of negotiations was launched a few \r\nweeks ago, thanks to the tireless and appreciated efforts \r\nof the President of the United States, Mr. Barack Obama, \r\nand of the United States Secretary of State, Mr. John \r\nKerry. I affirm before the Assembly today that we \r\nhave begun those negotiations and shall continue them \r\nin good faith and with open minds, strong will and \r\ndetermination and a sharp focus on success. I assure \r\nMembers that we shall respect all of our commitments \r\nand foster the atmosphere most conducive to continuing \r\nthe negotiations seriously and intensively, while \r\nproviding guarantees for its success and aiming at a \r\npeace agreement within nine months.\r\nAs we engage in a new round of negotiations, we \r\nmust remind everyone that we are not starting from a \r\nvacuum or from point zero, nor are we lost in a labyrinth \r\nwithout a map or a compass, at risk of losing sight of \r\nthe destination. The goal of the peace that we seek is \r\ndefined and the objective of the negotiations is clear \r\nto all, just as the terms of reference and the basis and \r\nfoundations of the peace process and of the agreement \r\nwe seek are longstanding and within reach.\r\nAs for the goal of peace, it is embodied in redressing \r\nthe historic, unprecedented injustice that befell the \r\nPalestinian people in the Al-Nakba of 1948. It is the \r\nrealization of a just peace, the fruits of which can be \r\nenjoyed by the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, as well \r\nas by all the peoples of our region.\r\nThe objective of the negotiations is to secure a \r\nlasting peace agreement that immediately leads to the \r\nestablishment of the independence of a fully sovereign \r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\npride that I can affirm that we are and always will be a \r\ncountry guided by the principles of the Charter of the \r\nOrganization.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI thank the President of the Republic of Guatemala for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guatemala, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the \r\nState of Palestine\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of \r\nPalestine, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State \r\nof Palestine, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Abbas (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić on his outstandingly successful presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its previous session. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption \r\nof the presidency at its current session and to wish you \r\nevery success.\r\nI am pleased, indeed honoured, to address the \r\nAssembly today for the first time in the name of \r\nthe State of Palestine, following the Assembly’s \r\nhistoric decision on 29 November of last year to raise \r\nPalestine’s status to that of a non-Member Observer \r\nState. As representatives of their Governments and \r\npeoples, Members have championed justice, right and \r\npeace, while affirming their rejection of occupation \r\nand standing for principles and ethics and on the side \r\nof peoples yearning for freedom. For that, I once again \r\noffer my deepest thanks and gratitude today on behalf \r\nof Palestine and its people. The Palestinian people \r\ncelebrated resolution 67/19. They rightly felt that they \r\nwere not alone in the world and that the world stood \r\nwith them. They celebrated because they realized that \r\nthe overwhelming result of the Assembly’s vote meant \r\nthat justice was still possible and there was still room \r\nfor hope.\r\n13-48656 27/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nthe requirements from the Palestinian side as set by the \r\ninternational community, in order to attain peace.\r\nAt the same time that the PLO affirmed its choice of \r\npeace as a strategic option and a solution resulting from \r\nnegotiations, the PLO firmly repudiated violence and \r\naffirmed an ethical, principled rejection of terrorism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations — especially State \r\nterrorism — while affirming respect of international \r\nhumanitarian law and United Nations resolutions.\r\nAs a genuine historic breakthrough, the signing \r\nof the Oslo Accords led to an unprecedented political \r\nmovement that fostered great hopes and generated \r\nhigh expectations. The PLO worked with dedication to \r\nimplement the Accords in order to end the occupation \r\nand to realize a just peace. However, 20 years on, the \r\npicture appears dispiriting and bleak: great dreams have \r\nbeen shattered and goals have become more modest. \r\nAs much as we felt in those days that peace was \r\nat hand, today we realize how far we are from it, for \r\nthe goal of the Accords has not been achieved, its \r\nprovisions have not been implemented and its deadlines \r\nhave not been respected. All the while, ongoing intense \r\nsettlement construction, which aims to change the facts \r\non the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory, has \r\nviolated the spirit of the agreement, struck at the core \r\nof the peace process and caused a deep fracture in its \r\ncornerstone, that is, the two-State solution.\r\nThe start of a new round of negotiations is good \r\nnews, but it cannot serve as grounds for complacency \r\nor an exaggerated sense of tranquility on the part of \r\nthe international community. The negotiations we \r\nare undertaking today with the Israeli Government \r\nunder the auspices of the United States require that \r\nthe international community exert every effort to \r\nmake them succeed, namely, through international and \r\nregional organizations and individual States upholding \r\nthe international consensus on the goal of peace, the \r\nobjectives of the negotiations, the terms of reference \r\nand the basis for a permanent peace agreement.\r\nHowever, at the same time, the international \r\ncommunity is asked to remain vigilant. The international \r\ncommunity must condemn and put an end to any actions \r\non the ground that would undermine negotiations. In \r\nthat regard, I refer above all to the continuation of \r\nsettlement construction on Palestinian land, particularly \r\nin Jerusalem. There is an international consensus \r\namong the countries of the world, international and \r\nregional organizations and the International Court \r\non all of the Palestinian land occupied in 1967, so that \r\nit may live in peace and security alongside the State of \r\nIsrael. The negotiations must also resolve the plight of \r\nPalestine refugees in a just, agreed-upon solution, in \r\naccordance with resolution 194 (III) and as called for \r\nby the Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nWe reaffirm our refusal to be drawn into the \r\nwhirlpool of a new interim agreement aimed at the \r\nperpetuation of an interim State with interim borders, \r\nor to enter into transitional arrangements that will \r\nbecome the fixed rule rather than an urgent exception. \r\nOur goal is to achieve a permanent and comprehensive \r\nagreement and a peace treaty between the States of \r\nPalestine and Israel that resolves all outstanding issues, \r\nanswers all questions and allows us to officially declare \r\nan end to the conflict and to all claims.\r\nThe terms of reference and parameters of the \r\nnegotiations, their goals and the basis of the agreement \r\nwe seek are all found in the Assembly’s historic decision \r\nto upgrade Palestine’s status, as well as in the countless \r\nresolutions of this body and of the Security Council \r\nand those of the League of Arab States, the European \r\nUnion, the Non-Aligned Movement, the African Union \r\nand the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. In fact, \r\nover the years, the parameters have become the basis \r\nof an international consensus, indeed, near unanimity.\r\nExactly 20 years ago, precisely on 13 September \r\n1993, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the \r\nsole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian \r\npeople signed, together with the Government of Israel, \r\nthe Declaration of Principles Agreement on the White \r\nHouse lawn in Washington, D.C, in the presence of our \r\ndeparted leader, Yasser Arafat, and Yitzhak Rabin, \r\nthe late Israeli Prime Minister, the King of Jordan and \r\nformer President Bill Clinton. \r\nSome five years earlier, on 15 November 1988, \r\nthe Palestinian National Council had adopted our \r\nprogramme for the achievement of peace, thereby \r\ntaking an extremely difficult decision and making a \r\nhistoric, painful and harmful concession. However, as \r\nrepresentatives of the Palestinian people, and having \r\nlong been aware of our responsibilities to them, we \r\nmustered the necessary courage to accept a two-State \r\nsolution, namely, Palestine and Israel on the borders \r\nof 4 June 1967 and the establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState on 22 per cent of the land of historic Palestine. \r\nThus we realized our part in achieving a historic \r\nsettlement, upheld our obligations and fulfilled all of \r\n28/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nof good-neighbourliness. Let us envision another future, \r\none that the children of Palestine and Israel enjoy in \r\npeace and security, where they can dream and realize \r\ntheir dreams, a future that allows Muslims, Christians \r\nand Jews to freely reach their places of worship, and a \r\nfuture in which Israel gains the recognition of 57 Arab \r\nand Muslim States, the States of Palestine and coexists \r\nin peace and each of their peoples can realize their \r\nhopes for progress and prosperity.\r\nWhile we discuss the realization of peace between \r\nPalestine and Israel as an imperative to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive peace between the Arab countries and \r\nIsrael in accordance with United Nations resolutions, \r\nwe bear in mind the current volatile reality and \r\nunprecedented dynamics besetting our region. \r\nPalestine does not interfere in the internal affairs of \r\nArab countries, but we have clearly affirmed our stance \r\nin support of the demands of the peoples of our region, \r\ntheir choices and their peaceful popular movements to \r\nachieve those demands, along with the programmes and \r\nroad maps they have adopted to reach their goals. \r\nFurthermore, while we have condemned the crime \r\nof the use of chemical weapons in Syria, we have \r\naffirmed our rejection of a military solution there and \r\nstressed the need to find a peaceful political solution to \r\nfulfil the aspirations of the Syrian people.\r\nThe overwhelming majority of the Palestinian \r\npeople were born in Palestine and were sent into exile \r\nafter the 1948 Al-Nakba. However, 65 years afterwards, \r\nthey continue to be its direct victims. Since the start of \r\nthis year, 27 Palestinian citizens have been killed and \r\n951 have been wounded by the bullets of the occupation, \r\nand 5,000 fighters for freedom and peace are currently \r\nbeing held captive in occupation prisons. Does anyone \r\ndeserve an end to this occupation and the realization of \r\na just and immediate peace more than the Palestinian \r\npeople?\r\nThis year and in the past few years, Palestinian \r\nrefugees, despite their neutrality, have continued to pay \r\nthe price of conflict and instability in our region. Tens \r\nof thousands have been forced to abandon their camps \r\nand to f lee in another exodus, searching for new places \r\nof exile. Do the Palestinian people deserve justice less \r\nthan the rest of the peoples of the world?\r\nSince the beginning of the year, construction has \r\nbeen under way on thousands of settlement units by the \r\noccupation authorities, and construction tenders have \r\nof Justice on the illegality and illegitimacy of those \r\nsettlements. The position of the European Union with \r\nregard to settlement projects is a positive model of what \r\ncan be done to ensure an environment supportive of \r\nand conducive to negotiations and the peace process. \r\nIt is also imperative that the near-daily attacks on the \r\nreligious sites in occupied Jerusalem, the foremost of \r\nwhich is the Al-Aqsa Mosque, cease, as the continuation \r\nof such attacks will have dire consequences.\r\nHistory is the best teacher. It teaches us that waging \r\nwar, imposing occupation and building settlements \r\nand walls may provide temporary quiet and temporary \r\ndomination, but they certainly do not ensure real \r\nsecurity or guarantee sustainable peace. Such policies \r\nmay create a specific reality on the ground, but they \r\ncertainly do not create a right or provide legitimacy. \r\nSuch policies may impose weak stability, but they \r\ncannot prevent the inevitable explosion, because such \r\npolices in fact fuel situations that are already inflamed \r\nand cause them to explode. Above all, such policies are \r\nincapable of extinguishing the aspirations of a people \r\nfor freedom, and cannot eradicate their living memory \r\nor their narrative.\r\nTherefore, what is required now is to heed the \r\nlessons of history, to abandon the mentality of force \r\nand occupation, to recognize the rights of others \r\nand to work on an equal footing and in full parity to \r\nachieve peace. What is required is to stop relying on \r\nexaggerated security pretexts and obsessions in order to \r\nconsecrate occupation and to stop contriving demands \r\nthat push the conflict out of its defined political arena \r\nand towards the abyss of religious conflict in a region \r\nburdened with such sensitivities. That is something that \r\nwe categorically reject.\r\nI am confident that the Israeli people want peace \r\nand that a majority of them support a two-State solution. \r\nWe have always expressed our firm positions and have \r\nalways explained them at the negotiations table with the \r\nIsraeli Government and in the meetings and contacts \r\nthat we have intensified in recent years with a wide \r\nspectrum of actors from Israeli society.\r\nOur message is rooted in the idea that the two \r\npeoples, the Palestinians and Israelis, are partners in \r\nthe task of peacemaking. That is why we keep reaching \r\nout to the Israeli side, saying: let us work to make the \r\nculture of peace reign, to tear down walls, to build \r\nbridges instead of walls and to open wide roads for \r\nconnections and communication. Let us sow the seeds \r\n13-48656 29/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nwere uprooted in 1948 from our beautiful world and \r\nthrown into exile. Like hundreds of thousands of other \r\nPalestine refugees, I knew as a youth the pain of exile \r\nand the tragedy of the loss of loved ones in massacres \r\nand wars, as well as the difficulties of building a new \r\nlife from zero. In refugee camps and the diaspora, \r\nin exile, we knew the bitter taste of poverty, hunger, \r\nillness and humiliation, and the challenge of affirming \r\none’s identity.\r\nOur people have walked the path of armed revolution \r\nand have risen from the ashes of Al-Nakba. They have \r\ncollected their shattered souls and identity to put their \r\ncause to the world and ensure that the recognition \r\nof their rights is enshrined. We have walked a long, \r\ndifficult path and sacrificed dearly, and yet we have \r\naffirmed at all times our active quest for peace.\r\nTwenty years ago, on behalf of the Palestine \r\nLiberation Organization, I signed the Declaration \r\nof Principles Agreement, and we have since worked \r\nfaithfully and diligently to implement it, affirming to \r\nall our respect for our commitments and the credibility \r\nof our positions. The successive setbacks encountered \r\nhave not shaken our strong faith in the objective of a \r\njust peace, and we shall continue to work tirelessly \r\nand unwaveringly to see it realized. My own personal \r\nhope is to see the day when a just peace reigns so that \r\nthe generation of Al-Nakba can pass on to its children \r\nand grandchildren the f lag of an independent State of \r\nPalestine.\r\nTime is running out; the window of hope is \r\nnarrowing and opportunities are diminishing. The \r\ncurrent round of negotiations appears to be a last \r\nchance to realize a just peace. The mere thought of the \r\ncatastrophic and frightening consequences of failure \r\nmust compel the international community to intensify \r\nefforts to seize this opportunity.\r\nThe hour of freedom for the Palestinian people has \r\nrung. The hour of the independence of Palestine has \r\nrung. The hour of peace for the two peoples — Israeli \r\nand Palestinian — has rung.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the State of Palestine \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of \r\nPalestine, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nbeen issued for thousands of others on our occupied \r\nland, even as additional vast areas of land are either \r\nexpropriated or declared off limits; 850 homes and \r\nstructures have been demolished.\r\nPalestinians are forbidden to plant on their own land \r\nand to use the majority of the area of our country, which \r\nis only 22 per cent. They are prevented from using their \r\nown country’s water to irrigate their crops. The wall \r\nand checkpoints continue to tear apart the lives of the \r\nPalestinian people and to destroy their economy. The \r\nsiege is growing tighter, along with the attacks and \r\noppressive discriminatory measures against occupied \r\nJerusalem, its holy places and its citizens. In Gaza, \r\nfor years an unjust blockade has been imposed on our \r\npeople.\r\nSo is there any people more deserving of freedom \r\nand independence than the Palestinians? Since the \r\nbeginning of the year, 708 terrorist attacks have \r\nbeen perpetrated by settlers against our mosques and \r\nchurches, our olive trees, our agricultural fields and our \r\nhomes and property. Is there the shadow of a doubt in \r\nanyone’s mind that the Palestinian people have the most \r\nneed of security?\r\nAlso, is there a nobler mission on the international \r\ncommunity’s agenda than realizing a just peace in the \r\nland of the monotheistic faiths, the birthplace of Jesus \r\nChrist, the site of the ascent of the Prophet Muhammad \r\nand the resting place of Abraham, the father of the \r\nprophets?\r\nAs they remain steadfast on their land, the \r\nPalestinian people also continue to build their \r\ninstitutions, to strengthen internal unity, to achieve \r\nreconciliation by returning to the ballot box, to \r\nwage a peaceful and popular resistance to counter \r\nthe oppression of occupation and of settlements and \r\nsettler terrorism, and to hold fast to their rights. The \r\nPalestinian people do not want to remain “out of place”, \r\nin the words of Edward Said. Our people are waiting for \r\nthe day when their cause ceases to be a fixed item on \r\nthe agenda of the United Nations. Our people want to \r\nhave freedom, God’s gift to humanity, and to enjoy the \r\ngrace of living an ordinary life. For we, as Mahmoud \r\nDarwish wrote, cultivate hope and shall one day be \r\nwhat we want to be: a free, sovereign people on the land \r\nof the State of Palestine.\r\nI personally am one of the victims of Al-Nakba, \r\none of the hundreds of thousands of my people who \r\n30/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nof urban slum dwellers has declined substantially, and \r\nthere has been visible improvement in the areas of \r\nhealth and education.\r\nYet, as significant as those achievements are, we \r\nare now at a watershed moment. The international \r\ncommunity has already recognized the need to push \r\nthe Goals further, beyond 2015, and to see that they \r\nbecome sustainable development goals. An important \r\nstock-taking exercise has been taking place so as to \r\nensure that no one is left behind, that no human being \r\nfeels merely like a scrap of life, living at the edge of \r\nexistence.\r\nIt would be easy for us to think of poverty as \r\nbelonging elsewhere, if we did not see it all around us. \r\nWe have the luxury of exercising wilful blindness to \r\nmalnutrition and disease, pretending that they belong \r\nto a different culture, to a different nationality, to a \r\nfictitious world that is wiped away as easily as f lipping \r\na television channel. It would also be easy for us to think \r\nthat we can be altruistic, since we are lucky enough to \r\nlive without want. \r\nBut we are not here today to be blind. What brings \r\nus together at the General Assembly, year after year, \r\nto hear speech after speech, is a longing to belong. We \r\nwant to be part of something bigger, something that \r\ngoes beyond our self-imposed borders of language, \r\nculture and tradition. We want to belong to that global \r\nsea of peoples sharing a single purpose. That longing or \r\nneed to come together tugs at our hearts with hope and \r\nempathy for those at the margins of humankind. We \r\nwant to do something worthwhile. We want to commit \r\nour intelligence to being effective agents of change. \r\n“Make poverty history,” we once heard, and indeed we \r\nhave worked towards that aim. \r\nBut, as we hold those noble aims high, we also \r\nquestion whether our plan is a priority, whether it \r\nwill fit within our national budget or our political life \r\ncycles. And then we pause to consider our options, to \r\nchoose what will hurt us the least. The poor do not have \r\nthe luxury of granting us time to take our decisions. \r\nHumankind cannot wait for a better time, when there \r\nis no financial crisis. We, the international community, \r\nneed to forge ahead with determination to reach all our \r\ngoals. \r\nI am proud to note today Malta’s long-standing \r\nhistory of solidarity with other nations all over the \r\nworld. Our accession to the European Union took that \r\nsolidarity a step further, and my country assumed \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Malta\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta.\r\nMr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Malta, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Muscat (Malta): I wish to join other delegations \r\nat this gathering in congratulating you, Mr. President, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. I am sure that under your \r\nguidance and through your excellent diplomatic skills \r\nwe will have a rich exchange of ideas and a fruitful \r\noutcome. I also wish to extend my congratulations and \r\ngratitude to your predecessor, Vuk Jeremić, for his \r\nsuccessful stewardship of the previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. My deepest appreciation also goes \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose \r\npassion and commitment have been instrumental in the \r\nwork of the organization.\r\nI will start by taking the Assembly back a few years. \r\nAll here will certainly remember how not too long ago \r\nthe world waited in anticipation and hope for the clock \r\nto push past midnight to the year 2000. As with most \r\nfresh starts, the new millennium brought with it a sense \r\nof promise and, indeed, something extraordinary was \r\ntaking place.\r\nFor the first time in history, Governments \r\nhad committed themselves to “walk the talk” by \r\nadhering to a set of measurable targets aimed at \r\nlifting millions out of poverty by the year 2015. The \r\nso-called Millennium Development Goals were bold \r\nand ambitious. They became national and global \r\npriorities, setting Government policies and generating \r\na strong commitment across wide areas towards their \r\nattainment. Failure, it was felt, was not an option.\r\nUndoubtedly, there have been remarkable \r\nsuccesses. The number of people living in extreme \r\npoverty has fallen, as have poverty rates. Access to \r\nsources of clean water has improved. The proportion \r\n13-48656 31/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nfailures. It would be easy to f lip channels once again, \r\nto “park it in someone else’s back yard”. But it is not \r\nsomeone else’s problem. Irregular immigration, human \r\ntrafficking and modern-day slavery are everyone’s \r\nproblem. We all have to play a part in solving it, not \r\nonly regionally but also globally.\r\nThere needs to be a sustained evolution in our \r\nthinking. At the threshold of the year 2015, we urge \r\nfellow nations not only to think beyond the current \r\nMillennium Development Goals and how to ensure \r\ntheir sustainability, but also to think of other goals that \r\ncould be included. There can be no unfinished business. \r\nThere can be no sustainable development goals without \r\npeace, without fighting corruption, without respect for \r\nhuman rights and without economic equality, which is \r\nthe social justice issue of our time. \r\nThe news headlines may not shock us anymore, but \r\nthose living in fear of losing their lives and those of \r\ntheir families do not live in order to make news. They \r\nlook to survive. Whether scrapping for food or seeking \r\nshelter from bullets, whether hiding their daughters to \r\nprevent them from falling victim to rape as a tool of \r\nwar or keeping sons from being forcibly recruited as \r\nchild soldiers, millions of people all over the world live \r\ndreading tomorrow. Each day they die a little bit more.\r\nWe bear responsibility for not safeguarding their \r\nsense of belonging as equal human beings on this planet. \r\nMalta firmly believes that the United Nations can and \r\nmust do more to safeguard human dignity and stir the \r\nconscience of humankind. No undertaking can be as \r\nfundamental as addressing the needs of the peoples of \r\nthe world, and no organization is better situated to see \r\nthat that can be done than the United Nations.\r\nMalta’s geostrategic location makes it look most \r\nclosely at that which surrounds it. We are proud to be a \r\npeople of the sea, of a Mediterranean Sea that has given \r\nus life and marked our history. We are proud of our \r\ncontributions towards the health of that sea, the many \r\nexchanges that we support and the good relations we \r\nmaintain with all our neighbours, North and South. \r\nBut we are also troubled by the conflicts and \r\nsuffering that we see around us. Waves of new \r\ntomorrows and hopeful struggles for democracy in \r\nNorth Africa have given way to new realities that were \r\nunthinkable when the Millennium Development Goals \r\nwere drawn up. Sectarian strife, religious tensions and \r\npower struggles have halted or reversed the progress \r\nof development. It is almost correct to say that the \r\nresponsibilities and obligations in the context of \r\nproviding overseas development assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries. That remains a cornerstone of \r\nMalta’s international relations, and we remain firmly \r\nengaged in seeking the eradication of poverty and the \r\nsustainable development of societies in need. We are \r\nproud to form part of the European Union, which is the \r\nworld’s largest donor of development aid, and we are \r\ncommitted to reaching the goals that we have set and to \r\nbeing a reliable partner for those in need.\r\nI am equally proud to recall that this year marks the \r\ntwenty-fifth year since Malta proposed to the General \r\nAssembly that climate conservation should be part of \r\nhumankind’s shared concerns, a concept that launched \r\nthe process leading to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. Malta is proud to have \r\nbeen at the forefront of that discussion. We are adamant \r\nabout keeping the issue alive, for we are conscious of \r\nthe fact that climate change hits hardest the world’s \r\nmost vulnerable.\r\nIn defining a common vision for the future, we \r\nbelieve that the eradication of poverty and the promotion \r\nof sustainable development must be at the heart of the \r\npost-2015 development framework. In the words of the \r\nformer President of South Africa, Mr. Nelson Mandela, \r\n“[o]vercoming poverty is not a gesture of charity. \r\nIt is an act of justice. Like slavery and apartheid, \r\npoverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be \r\novercome and eradicated by the actions of human \r\nbeings.” \r\nMalta is committed to continuing to engage with its \r\ninternational partners in developing a post-2015 global \r\ndevelopment agenda that delivers on the promise of a \r\nbetter and fairer world for all.\r\nMalta also understands the need to act in other \r\nvery tangible ways. When rickety boats laden with \r\nirregular migrants reach our shores, which happens \r\neach and every day, we see the suffering, we feel the \r\nloss of dignity etched on people’s faces. We understand \r\nthat they are caught in a web of poverty and criminal \r\nexploitation. We feel for those f leeing persecution and \r\npoverty. They are desperately searching for safety and \r\nprosperity. We do everything we can to provide them \r\nwith the help they need, offering refuge and respite.\r\nYet Malta cannot do that alone. The international \r\ncommunity must do more in the face of an ongoing \r\nsituation that is nothing but tragic evidence of our global \r\n32/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nresources and stif les our potential. The United Nations \r\nfamily, committed as it is to the purposes of peace and \r\nprosperity among nations, understands that. \r\nMalta firmly believes that true peace in our time \r\nneeds to be the overriding goal, the one target to which \r\nwe should all aspire and for which we should all work. \r\nWe need to ensure stable and peaceful societies if \r\nwe want to take the Millennium Development Goals \r\nfurther. The opportunities for all to thrive are at hand. \r\nThe United Nations is and should be the force field to \r\nwhich all nations gravitate in order to solve differences \r\nand push boundaries together. \r\nOur global goals and commitments cannot be solely \r\ntime-bound but must also be outcome-oriented. We \r\nneed to think inclusively and holistically. Post-2015, we \r\nshould not be looking towards rebooting, but towards \r\ncontinuity with greater purpose and greater ambition. \r\nFewer people dying every day is a great achievement, \r\nbut more people truly living is an astounding victory \r\nfor all.\r\nHowever, to get there we have to realize that \r\neveryone has an equal voice. People need to be involved \r\nin decision-making, since it affects their lives and their \r\nlivelihoods. They should be foremost in our minds as we \r\nconsider the world’s natural resources and tackle global \r\nconcerns such as climate change. There is never only \r\none way of doing things. We can achieve our targets \r\nonly if we listen to the people whom we are meant to \r\nrepresent and make them part of the decision-making \r\nprocess.\r\nA few weeks ago, a young girl, Malala, from \r\nPakistan, spoke in this very Hall of her dream for \r\ngirls to get an education and wield the power of the \r\npen. Yesterday, at a gathering I attended, she said that \r\neveryone should send books, not bombs. \r\nThirteen years ago, our leaders had a dream: to live \r\nup to the millennium moment and to better peoples’ lives. \r\nAs we approach the year 2015, we need to remember the \r\nhope and determination we felt as we crossed into the \r\nnew millennium, that determination to make the world \r\na somewhat better place through the goals we reach \r\ntogether. We need to carry that forward and continue \r\nto make dreams happen. Every day, millions of people \r\naround the world dream of something more than a scrap \r\nof a life. Indeed, there are no scraps of life.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMalta for the statement he has just made.\r\nMediterranean Sea is at a boiling point and that the \r\nnext conflict — one over scarce resources, contested \r\nborders or even cultural offences — is just waiting to \r\nhappen. But there can be no stalemate or acceptance of \r\nthe status quo if we truly believe that the peoples of the \r\nMediterranean deserve better. No violations of human \r\nrights or shaky institutions can be accepted if we are \r\nto look truly holistically at a new positive agenda for \r\nhumankind. The deepening links between the lives of \r\npeoples across countries demand coordinated global \r\naction. We must face that challenge.\r\nMalta firmly believes that more can be done by \r\nthe community of nations gathered here to support the \r\nfragile democracies that are struggling to take root \r\nwhere dictators formerly ruled. More can and should \r\nbe done to ensure that the economies of the region are \r\nable to f lourish, that intraregional trade is supported \r\nand that cultural exchanges are fostered. More needs \r\nto be done to stop the violence and bloodshed that risk \r\nbecoming the norm for those of us who see the evolution \r\nof events.\r\nMalta calls upon the international community to \r\nlook with compassion on the innocents in Syria. That \r\nis a humanitarian catastrophe with no end in sight — a \r\nhorrendous and indiscriminate tragedy. Each child’s \r\ndeath and each mother’s wail should shame us all. People \r\nare morally outraged around the world, and justifiably \r\noutraged, for there can never be any justification for the \r\nappalling suffering that is taking place. \r\nThe Mediterranean Sea basin remains awash with \r\npromise but polluted with pain and prejudice. The \r\nMiddle East remains a hate-filled maelstrom and the \r\nmost explosive region in the world. How many more \r\nneed to die, not just in that region but everywhere \r\nelse because of conflict and terrorism? How many \r\nmore need to leave all their belongings to join hurried \r\nconvoys, fearful of losing their lives? How much longer \r\ncan the rights of others be ignored and trampled upon \r\nwhile others enjoy their perceived rights? We need to \r\nstop that wildfire. We need to stop the further descent \r\ninto brutality and carnage. Those responsible must be \r\nbrought to international justice.\r\nMalta is convinced that we cannot start talking of \r\na post-2015 agenda if we cannot solve our differences \r\ntoday. We do not have a carte blanche privilege to be \r\nimmune and indifferent, for the cost of our inaction \r\nis greater than the cost of our effort and commitment. \r\nConflict saps the focus from our goals. It drains our \r\n13-48656 33/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nWith the escalating despair of refugees now as \r\nthey head for a harsh winter, I would like to announce \r\nthat the Government of Japan will provide and make \r\nimmediately available approximately $60 million in \r\nadditional humanitarian assistance to Syria and its \r\nsurrounding countries. We are determined to conduct \r\nsuch assistance in parallel with the process of political \r\ndialogue, notably the “Geneva II” conference, and to \r\nmove forward in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nOur nation, Japan, and its capital, Tokyo, have \r\nbeen granted the honour of hosting the 2020 Olympic \r\nand Paralympic Games, seven years from now. To \r\nreciprocate that good fortune we have come to enjoy, my \r\nobligation first of all is to rebuild the Japanese economy \r\nto be vibrant, and then to make Japan a dependable \r\nforce that works for good in the world. I pledge here \r\nthat I will make Japan a force for peace and stability \r\nin the world, just as it has been until now — or, rather, \r\nmake it an even greater such force than it has been thus \r\nfar, given the increasingly tragic state of the globe.\r\nJapan will newly bear the f lag of proactive \r\ncontributor to peace, anchored in the undeniable record \r\nof and the solid appreciation for our country, which has \r\nendeavoured to bring peace and prosperity to the world \r\nwhile emphasizing cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe balance of power in the world has been \r\nchanging rapidly, and technological innovations are \r\nnow removing all borders from both new opportunities \r\nand new types of threats. It is now impossible for any \r\none country, no matter which one it may be, to safeguard \r\nits own peace and security acting entirely by itself. \r\nThat is why Japan is working to garner trust from the \r\nworld as a creator of added value and a net contributor \r\nto regional and global peace and stability. Under those \r\ncircumstances, the role of the United Nations will \r\nbecome even more important than it is today. \r\nJapan has continually promoted the concept of \r\nhuman security, and the implications of the concept will \r\nsurely expand. Through the accumulated discussions \r\nover the nine years since the submission of a report \r\nby the Commission on Human Security, the resolution \r\non a common understanding on the notion of human \r\nsecurity was adopted, here at the General Assembly, \r\nin September 2012 (resolution 66/290). Guided by the \r\nwisdom of its forerunners, Japan is determined to \r\nfurther spread the concept and build actual practices.\r\nMr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister  \r\nof Japan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister \r\nof Japan, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): First, I would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\r\nI would now like to make a new pledge about \r\nthe situation in Syria. The use of chemical weapons \r\nhas caused profound shock and anger on the part \r\nof the people of Japan, including myself. Chemical \r\nweapons must never be used again. I hereby declare \r\nthat Japan will provide thorough support to, and the \r\ngreatest possible cooperation with, the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to dispose of Syria’s chemical \r\nweapons. We feel righteous indignation about innocent \r\ncivilians continuing to be victims. Japan regards the \r\ncessation of violence, the initiation of political dialogue \r\nand the improvement of the appalling humanitarian \r\nconditions as issues of the utmost urgency. \r\nAt this very moment, the number of refugees \r\nis soaring. To them, Japan will provide still greater \r\nassistance. We will act in cooperation with the \r\ninternational community to extend a helping hand \r\nto internally displaced persons and refugees f leeing \r\nacross national borders. I take pride in the fact that \r\nJapan’s non-governmental organizations and volunteer \r\norganizations are working around the clock to help \r\nthem.\r\nJapan will also continue to provide assistance to \r\nareas under the control of the opposition groups, where \r\nit is difficult for assistance from the international \r\ncommunity to reach. We are working to undertake the \r\ntraining of staff working at medical centres. We will \r\nalso deliver portable X-ray devices and other medical \r\nequipment to those areas.\r\n34/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nthat occasion, I was deeply struck by the eagerness \r\nexpressed by representatives of African nations for \r\nprivate sector investment. \r\nInvestment f low to Africa now exceeds the f low \r\nof assistance. I also heard from the African leaders \r\ntime and again that assistance should be utilized \r\nstrategically as a catalyst for attracting investment. \r\nThat is the evolution that discussions in the 20-year-\r\nlong TICAD process have witnessed and given rise to. \r\nTICAD V became a forum where we celebrated the \r\npath that Africa has walked down, and together we \r\nreconfirmed that Japan has been an enduring partner \r\nweaving dreams side by side with Africa.\r\nI hold the firm conviction that the future course \r\nof Japan’s diplomacy will begin here, by sparing \r\nno pains — and with our regained strength and \r\ncapacity — to become actively engaged in meeting the \r\nhistoric challenges that today’s world faces. I consider \r\n“sparing no pains” to be nothing less than the basso \r\ncontinuo notes that set the basic tone for Japan’s actions, \r\nbe they in diplomacy or any other field.\r\nAs a country with such intentions, strengths and \r\nachievements, Japan considers it extremely regrettable \r\nthat the structure of the Security Council is still frozen \r\nin a state that reflects the realities of some 70 years ago. \r\nSecurity Council reform must proceed without delay. \r\nJapan’s aspirations to becoming a permanent member \r\nof the Council have not changed in the slightest.\r\nEverything begins with Japan refortifying its true \r\nabilities and its economy. The growth of Japan will \r\nbenefit the world. Japan’s decline would be a loss for \r\npeople everywhere. How, then, does Japan aim to \r\nrealize its growth? Mobilizing the power of women will \r\nserve as both a source and outcome of growth, a point \r\nalmost self-evident at this gathering.\r\nThere is a theory called “womenomics”, which \r\nasserts that the more the advancement of women \r\nin society is promoted, the more growth increases. \r\nCreating an environment in which women find it \r\ncomfortable to work and enhancing opportunities for \r\nwomen to work and to be active in society is no longer \r\na matter of choice for Japan. It is instead a matter of the \r\ngreatest urgency.\r\nHaving declared my intention to create a society \r\nin which women shine, I have been working to change \r\nJapan’s domestic structures. However, that is not \r\nconfined merely to domestic matters. I would now \r\nI will enable Japan, as a proactive contributor to \r\npeace, to be even more actively engaged in United \r\nNations collective security measures, including \r\npeacekeeping operations. I believe that Japan must \r\ncontinually cultivate our human resources so that they \r\nare appropriate for use in United Nations activities.\r\nFor Japan, whose national interests are firmly \r\nconnected to the stability of open seas, changes to the \r\nmaritime order through the use of force or coercion \r\ncannot be condoned under any circumstances. Japan \r\nhas great expectations that public spaces, ranging \r\nfrom outer space and cyberspace to the skies and the \r\nseas, will be rigorously preserved as global commons \r\ngoverned by rules and laws.\r\nJapan, as a country that understands the horror and \r\ndevastation wrought by atomic bombs, will utterly devote \r\nitself to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation and \r\nthe total elimination of nuclear weapons. North Korea’s \r\nnuclear and missile development cannot be condoned. \r\nJapan also maintains serious concerns with respect to \r\nother weapons of mass destruction that North Korea is \r\nlikely to possess. Pyongyang should listen to the unified \r\nvoice of the international community and rectify its \r\nown actions by taking a tangible step. We demand that \r\nNorth Korea return every Japanese national whom it \r\nhas abducted, without exception. While in office, I \r\nam determined to resolve that issue completely. The \r\nnormalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea \r\nremains unthinkable without the resolution of that \r\nissue.\r\nAs for the nuclear issue of Iran, Japan hopes that \r\nthe country’s new Administration will move forward \r\nwith concrete actions. We are ready to continue to play \r\na role in resolving the issue.\r\nIn the Middle East region, a cornerstone for world \r\npeace and prosperity, Japan will continue its unique \r\ncontributions towards the Middle East peace process.\r\nJapan will also continue to extend cooperation to \r\nthe countries of Africa, which are certain to become a \r\ngrowth engine in the twenty-first century. Firmly rooted \r\nin our own experiences, that cooperation takes the \r\nfostering of human resources as its main emphasis and \r\nseeks to achieve sustainable growth while cultivating \r\nownership by Africa itself. In June, my Government \r\ninvited African Heads of State and Government and \r\nrepresentatives of international organizations to \r\nJapan, where it convened the fifth Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development (TICAD V). On \r\n13-48656 35/36\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.12\r\nuse of public entertainment to persuade the villagers, \r\nMs. Sato finally found herself accepted by the village \r\ncommunity. Ms. Sato’s tenacity gradually transformed \r\nthe traditional idea that the one who decides the number \r\nof children is the husband, not the wife, into a mindset \r\nthat values the health of women.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, my country played \r\na leading role in the establishment of the the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Japan \r\nintends to continue to make an appropriate contribution \r\nat the upcoming Fourth Replenishment, which seeks to \r\nsecure additional financing for the Fund. However, as \r\nfor the post-2015 development agenda, it would be most \r\nappropriate to broaden the focus to encompass those \r\ndiseases individually. \r\nJapan regards approaches that address individuals \r\nholistically as better able to meet their broader health \r\nneeds. That is why Japan decided to promote universal \r\nhealth coverage — “UHC — on the occasion of TICAD \r\nV. To address health issues in the African region, \r\nwe have readied $500 million and are at present \r\nconcentrating on setting up training for 120,000 health \r\nand medical services providers. With regard to medical \r\ncare for all, there can be no doubt that the people who \r\ngive the human touch to the three letters in “UHC” are, \r\nin concrete terms, people like Ms. Sato, who without \r\nhesitation go into local communities. \r\nThe second person I would like to introduce is \r\nMs. Nilufa Yeasmin, a young Bangladeshi woman and \r\nthe mother of two. Her professional title is “Poly-Glu \r\nLady”. Poly-Glu is a made-in-Japan water purifier \r\nderived from a food that can be found in Japan in great \r\nabundance. One simply adds it to turbid water. Poly-Glu \r\nacts as an adsorbent, adhering to excess substances in \r\nthe water, and then falls to the bottom as a precipitate, \r\nleaving the water clear. It is necessary to teach people \r\nhow to use it correctly at the outset, and Ms. Yeasmin \r\nand other Poly-Glu ladies serve as both salespersons \r\nand instructors.\r\nAs members can see, as with what is called a “base of \r\nthe pyramid” business, that endeavour is characterized \r\nby the expectations placed on the power of women. By \r\ncombining her income with her husband’s, Ms. Yeasmin \r\nhas been able to send her children to an institution of \r\nhigher education. Poverty caused her to give up on the \r\ndream she had cherished as a little girl of becoming a \r\ndoctor someday. But I understand that now she proudly \r\nstates she has become a doctor of clean water. Can we \r\nlike to discuss how it is also an issue guiding Japan’s \r\ndiplomacy. To begin with, I would like to state four \r\ncontributions through which Japan aspires to remain a \r\nleading member within the international community. \r\nFirst, Japan respects the activities of UN-Women \r\nand intends to become one of its leading contributors, \r\nand therefore an exemplary country in that area. Japan \r\nwill also work closely with the relevant international \r\norganizations.\r\nSecondly, as other like-minded countries have \r\nalready done, Japan also intends to develop a national \r\naction plan with regard to women, peace and security, \r\nin cooperation with people working at the grass-roots \r\nlevel. \r\nThirdly, Japan will cooperate closely with not \r\nonly UN-Women, but also the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the Office of the Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict, \r\nMs. Zainab Hawa Bangura. It is an outrage that there \r\ncontinues to be sexual violence against women during \r\ntimes of armed conflict even now, in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Japan will do everything possible to prevent \r\nsuch crimes against women and to support — both \r\nmaterially and psychologically — those people who \r\nunfortunately become victims of such acts.\r\nFourthly, Japan will submit once more at the next \r\nsession of the Commission on the Status of Women \r\na draft resolution that gives careful consideration to \r\nwomen in natural disasters, as they are likely to be \r\nvulnerable. Japan, which experienced a major natural \r\ndisaster two years ago, wishes to garner support for \r\nthe draft resolution, which embodies our outpouring of \r\nsupport for the matter.\r\nI would now like to make use of the examples \r\nof three individuals to clarify Japan’s development \r\nconcept aimed at bringing about a society in which \r\nwomen shine, and also to shed light on some issues that \r\nmust be tackled. I will first introduce the examples of \r\na Japanese woman and a Bangladeshi woman, and then \r\nthat of an Afghan woman, as the third example.\r\nMs. Tokiko Sato was an expert at the Japan \r\nInternational Cooperation Agency, responsible for \r\nimproving maternal, newborn and child health for \r\nover 15 years in a remote village in Jordan. Undaunted \r\nby the suspicious looks she initially received from \r\nthe villagers, Ms. Sato would speak with anyone, \r\nanywhere. Devoted to her ideas, including making \r\n36/36 13-48656\r\nA/68/PV.12 26/09/2013\r\nof maternal, newborn and child health, an MDG \r\nwhose attainment has been conspicuously slow. My \r\nAdministration will, as its second priority policy area, \r\nengage greater efforts towards women’s health and \r\nmedical care.\r\nFinally, what I hoped to convey through the tragic \r\nexample of Islam Bibi is the importance of women’s \r\nparticipation and their protection in the context \r\nof peace and security. Japan intends to promote \r\nmeasures to ensure women’s participation at all \r\nstages — including in conflict prevention and resolution \r\nand in peacebuilding — and to safeguard their rights \r\nand the physical well-being of women who are exposed \r\nto danger in times of conflict.\r\nI would like to state here that in establishing those \r\nthree pillars, the Government of Japan will direct \r\nofficial development assistance in excess of $3 billion \r\nover the next three years, to target the pillars.\r\nIn conclusion, if we were to follow the wisdom \r\nof the so-called “womenomics” theory, as mentioned \r\nearlier, the development concept aimed at cultivating \r\nthe power of women would generate greater peace and \r\nwell-being in the world. I wish to bring about a society \r\nwhere women shine, within Japan and in conflict \r\nregions and countries suffering from poverty. In that \r\ncontext, I do not consider the outlook to be optimistic. \r\nHowever, I know one thing: in Japan a considerable \r\nnumber of people are working unsparingly towards that \r\nend. They are the people who are making every effort to \r\nready themselves to be able to work together, in unity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.50 p.m. \r\nnot say that Ms. Yeasmin has acquired self-esteem, the \r\nmost precious asset of all? My Government wishes to \r\ncreate as many Ms. Nilufa Yeasmins as possible. \r\nBy the way, the company that makes Poly-Glu is a \r\nvery small Japanese company. We will work to enhance \r\nthe assistance to such companies and organizations to \r\nallow their ideas to bear fruit.\r\nFinally, there is one more woman I would like to \r\nintroduce to everyone in the Hall today, but this Afghan \r\nlady is no longer with us. Her name is Ms. Islam Bibi, \r\nand on 4 July she was gunned down and assassinated. \r\nShe was 37 years old and is survived by three children. \r\nMs. Islam Bibi was a proud female police officer \r\nwith the Afghan police. She came to shoulder heavy \r\nresponsibilities through her nine years of service. She \r\nguarded polling stations to monitor elections and was a \r\ntrainer to young female officers coming after her. We \r\nhave much work to be done. However, we must proceed \r\nundaunted.\r\nUnder the auspices of the Law and Order Trust Fund \r\nfor Afghanistan, Japan has been one of the countries that \r\nhave always taken great pains to improve the capacity \r\nof the Afghan police force and cultivate female police \r\nofficers, whose number will finally reach 1,800 — still \r\nfar from enough. I have renewed my determination to \r\ncontinue to provide support in order to prevent another \r\ncase like that of Islam Bibi.\r\nI wanted to emphasize — through the real-life \r\nexample of Ms. Nilufa Yeasmin in Bangladesh — the \r\nnecessity of promoting women’s participation in society \r\nand their empowerment. My Government has prioritized \r\nthat as its foremost policy and will continue to undertake \r\nhighly inventive efforts, including launching start-up \r\nbusinesses in Africa.\r\nThrough her actions, Ms. Tokiko Sato, the \r\nJapanese aid specialist, has highlighted the importance \r\n"
