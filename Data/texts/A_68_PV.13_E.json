It is also my great \r\npleasure to address the Assembly for the first time as \r\nthe President of the newest European Union member \r\nState.\r\nOur debate this year is focused on an issue of \r\nparamount importance for our planet’s future — the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. However, before sharing \r\nmy views on that central issue, I would like to share my \r\nthoughts on a broader understanding of sustainability. \r\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to outline sustainable \r\ndevelopment without touching upon one of its \r\nessential prerequisites: peace and security. As a global \r\ncommunity, we continue to witness, year after year, a \r\nplethora of deadly and prolonged international crises \r\nand new and emerging threats and conflicts. \r\nThe ongoing security and humanitarian catastrophe \r\nin Syria, with all its terrible effects and potential to \r\ndestabilize the region, is naturally foremost on our \r\nminds. We are saddened by the tremendous loss of life \r\nas a result of that ongoing conflict. We are particularly \r\nappalled and concerned by the findings and conclusions \r\nof the report of the United Nations Mission to Investigate \r\nAllegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons in the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic on the alleged use of chemical \r\nweapons in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August \r\n2013 (A/67/997). Croatia condemns in the strongest \r\nterms the use of chemical weapons. The international \r\ncommunity must ensure that there is no impunity for \r\nsuch crimes and that the perpetrators of those and \r\nother crimes are held to account. In that connection, \r\nwe welcome the United States-Russia Framework \r\nfor Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons of \r\n14 September. The priority must now be to provide \r\nfor its prompt and full implementation, starting with a \r\nprocess in the Security Council and the soonest possible \r\nadoption of a relevant Council resolution.\r\nThe United Nations was established at a time when \r\nthe world was emerging from a period that had witnessed \r\nthe worst atrocities of the twentieth century. In fact, it \r\nwas established for the very purpose of ensuring that \r\nsuch atrocities would not happen again.

Croatia’s interest \r\nand engagement in peacebuilding started some time ago \r\nand was further strengthened by our bitter experience \r\nin recent history. From the very beginning, Croatia \r\nactively participated in and contributed to the work of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nIn the PBC we have focused on three different, yet \r\nmutually reinforcing areas – strengthening security, \r\nstimulating socioeconomic prosperity and promoting \r\nhuman rights and gender equality. For example, as the \r\ncurrent PBC Chair and in line with the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission’s action plan for 2013, Croatia helped \r\norganize a joint meeting of the PBC and the Global \r\nCompact on the important topic of business for \r\npeacebuilding, which was held in June. Earlier today, \r\nCroatia, as PBC Chair and in cooperation with UN-\r\nWomen, organized a high-level ministerial meeting \r\non women’s economic empowerment in peacebuilding. \r\nThe meeting emphasized the critical role of women in \r\npeacebuilding processes and the fact that empowering \r\nwomen in the economy is essential for realizing women’s \r\nrights and achieving broader development goals.\r\nIn our view, progress in the areas of security, \r\ndevelopment, the rule of law and human rights must go \r\nhand in hand. We would especially like to stress the \r\ncritical importance that the rule of law plays in post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding and, therefore, in achieving \r\nlasting peace and sustainable development.\r\nFor its part, Croatia continues to follow the path \r\nof promoting an open and pluralistic democracy as \r\nthe best guarantee for safeguarding the human rights \r\nof its citizens. We believe that democracy needs to be \r\napproached in a holistic manner. Human and minority \r\nrights, the rule of law, good governance and the fight \r\nagainst corruption are intrinsic to democratic values. \r\nDemocracy is not only about civil and political rights; \r\nits focus is not only on free and fair elections, but also \r\non economic, social and cultural rights.\r\nCroatia will continue to seek the upholding \r\nof human rights standards across the globe. We \r\nparticularly support the abolition of the death penalty, \r\nthe implementation of anti-discrimination policies, the \r\neffective and full protection of the rights of the child and \r\nthe realization of the rights of persons with disabilities. \r\nWe will also spare no effort in raising awareness \r\nabout the importance of upholding and improving \r\nwomen’s and minority rights. Croatia fully supports \r\nthe pivotal role of the United Nations and its human \r\nand often do debate the overall effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations in ensuring international peace, it is \r\nimportant that we build on the lessons learned from \r\nboth past successes and past mistakes.\r\nIn that connection, allow me to highlight one such \r\npast success. January this year marked the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the end of the mandate of the United \r\nNations Transitional Administration for Eastern \r\nSlavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium in Croatia. It is \r\nconsidered to be one of the most successful peacekeeping \r\noperations in United Nations history. The mission \r\nwas able to peacefully reaffirm the independence, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, and paved the way for normalizing relations \r\nand cooperation in the region.\r\nOver the past 20 years Croatia has undertaken a \r\nlong and demanding journey from being a host nation \r\nfor a number of United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\non its territory to a peacekeeping contributor. Today, we \r\nare determined to continue our participation in many \r\ncurrent peacekeeping and peace-support operations \r\nand missions around the world. This year also marks \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the establishment of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY). It is a well-known fact that Croatia advocated \r\nthe establishment of the ICTY from the very beginning.\r\nWe wholeheartedly supported the strong \r\ndetermination of the international community to finally, \r\nonce and for all, put an end to the culture of impunity \r\nthat had for so long accompanied wars and armed \r\nconflicts. The establishment of the ad hoc criminal \r\ntribunals changed the landscape of international \r\ncriminal justice and paved the way for a whole new \r\nsystem, with the International Criminal Court at its \r\nhead. The establishment of the International Criminal \r\nCourt in 1998 can be regarded as one of the most \r\nimportant civilization achievements in the last century \r\nand the beginning of a new era of accountability. That \r\nis why we are calling on those countries that have not \r\nyet decided to adopt the Rome Statute to do so as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nOur own experience teaches us that peace often \r\ncomes at a high price. Maintaining peace often entails a \r\nlong-term and comprehensive commitment on the part \r\nof the international community. The United Nations \r\nrecognized that fact in establishing the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission (PBC) in 2005. Its aim is to direct and \r\nsustain the attention and efforts of the international \r\n13-48662 3/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nIn setting the stage for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, we, as a global community, will continue to \r\nbe confronted with many challenges, some of which I \r\nhave just mentioned. The United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20) has provided us \r\nwith important guidance with regard to establishing \r\nthe goals and multilateral architecture necessary for its \r\nimplementation. In that sense, we would like to express \r\nour satisfaction with the creation of the High-Level \r\nPolitical Forum, which we hope will be a stepping stone \r\nin the establishment of a strengthened institutional \r\narchitecture for sustainable development.\r\nScientists warn us that soon we will need two \r\nplanets to keep pace with the consumption-driven \r\ngrowth necessary to sustain our ever-increasing \r\npopulation. While we agree that a transformative shift \r\ntowards more sustainable development is needed, the \r\nquestion remains how to achieve that shift. Knowledge \r\nis the key. The science-policy interface, so often \r\nhighlighted in the run-up to the Rio+20 Conference \r\nand integrated into the vision of “The future we want” \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex), stands as a crucial link to \r\nthose innovative solutions.\r\nTo achieve a sustainable future, we need a \r\nconcurrent base of strong institutions, solidarity, \r\njustice and social development, with an approach that is \r\nmore targeted towards marginalized groups, including \r\nwomen’s empowerment, as well as a strong respect for \r\nthe environment and innovative growth. \r\nCroatia welcomes the already widely accepted \r\nview that education represents one of the main building \r\nblocks in every society and is a crucial driver for \r\ndevelopment. I am proud to represent a country among \r\nthe States championing the Global Education First \r\nInitiative. Croatia is fully committed to supporting the \r\nInitiative, and I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncall upon others to join our efforts to give life to the \r\nInitiative’s goals.\r\nOn 1 July, just over two and a half months ago, \r\nCroatia became the twenty-eighth member of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU). One of the primary reasons \r\nthat my country strove to become a full member of \r\nthe European Union was to secure a safe, democratic \r\nand stable future for ourselves and for forthcoming \r\ngenerations. Croatia firmly believes that EU \r\nenlargement has been one of that organization’s most \r\nsuccessful and productive policies. Because of that, \r\nwe believe that the European project should not and \r\ncannot stop at our borders. We firmly believe in the \r\nrights mechanisms, in particular the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. For that reason, Croatia has presented its bid \r\nfor membership in the Human Rights Council for the \r\nperiod of 2017-2019, remaining committed to making \r\nan active and substantial contribution to the activities \r\nand efforts of that very important United Nations body.\r\nIn the area of security, we consider the prevention \r\nof the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nespecially proliferation to non-State actors, to be a \r\nglobal security priority. Croatia believes that successful \r\nnon-proliferation is possible only through a combination \r\nof diligent work at the national level and the widest \r\npossible international cooperation. We firmly believe \r\nthat adherence to multilateral non-proliferation treaties, \r\nas well as participation in informal non-proliferation \r\ninitiatives, are an indispensable part of non-proliferation \r\nefforts. The most recent events in Syria are a horrible \r\nreminder and warning of how important it is that all \r\ninternational agreements on non-proliferation be \r\nuniversally complied with.\r\nCroatia is also very concerned about the issue of the \r\nuncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons \r\nand their excessive accumulation. We believe that those \r\nweapons present a great risk for the stability and security \r\nof many weak and fragile areas around the world. A \r\nmilestone in that area is the successful completion and \r\nopening for signature of the international Arms Trade \r\nTreaty, a uniquely drafted document establishing rules \r\nand criteria for trade in conventional arms. Croatia, as \r\nan original signatory State, would like to add its voice \r\nto those requesting urgent and universal adherence to \r\nthe treaty and its expedited entry into force.\r\nNowadays we are witnessing all around the world \r\nthe heavy toll of armed conflicts and wars. In any \r\nhumanitarian crisis, those paying the highest price \r\nfor the conflict are civilians, especially women and \r\nchildren. We commend the efforts undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations and other international donors to help \r\ncivilians, and we are contributing to them as much as \r\nwe can. \r\nHaving been an aid recipient, we have learned that \r\nthe donor-recipient relationship can be effective and \r\nefficient only if based on an equal partnership, mutual \r\nrespect and understanding. Development cooperation is \r\na multilevel process through which all sides can learn and \r\ngrow. Croatia will continue focusing its donor activities \r\non gender and child-sensitive issues, on maternal health \r\nand the prevention of mortality in children under 5, as \r\nwell as on enhancing girls’ education.\r\n4/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nCroatia welcomes the focus at this year’s debate on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nFinally, I would like to stress that we are all aware \r\nof the global challenges we face today. As a global \r\ncommunity, in looking for sustainable solutions, \r\nwe made strong commitments at last year’s Rio+20 \r\nConference, and we will need to make new ones as \r\nwe proceed with the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nTo achieve all of that, we will need to strengthen \r\nold partnerships and create new ones, both between \r\nGovernments and among Governments and civil \r\nsociety and other key stakeholders. In that respect, it \r\nis our belief that the United Nations and its institutions \r\noffer the best chance to help meet those expectations. \r\nLet us, as its Member States, make the best use of all \r\nthat it has to offer.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Croatia for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Ivo Josipović, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Christopher J. Loeak, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Christopher J. Loeak, President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Christopher \r\nJ. Loeak, President of the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Loeak: It is my honour to convey to \r\nthe Assembly the warm greeting of “Yokwe” from the \r\nGovernment and people of the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands.\r\nEvery September, world leaders take to the stage \r\nof the General Assembly to broadcast our common \r\nconcerns. But I am concerned that this poetic ritual too \r\noften hides the problem of political will. In January, the \r\nSecretary-General outlined two key political priorities \r\nfor leaders: addressing climate change risks and the \r\nstrategic importance of the EU’s enlargement policy. \r\nIt must be continued with respect to all countries of \r\nthe Western Balkans — based on their individual \r\nmerits — as it is the best option for long-term stability \r\nin the region. We strongly support all of the countries \r\nin our neighbourhood in their endeavours and believe \r\nthat their efforts towards future membership of the \r\nEuropean Union will be successful.\r\nIt is important to understand that reconciliation \r\nand cooperation have become a new standard for \r\nregional policies, and in that regard, we welcome closer \r\ncollaboration among all countries of South-Eastern \r\nEurope, both bilaterally and in the framework of \r\nregional organizations and initiatives.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to address the \r\nissue of United Nations reform. We believe that there \r\nis a need for true reform of the current United Nations \r\nstructures and mechanisms if the United Nations is to \r\nachieve its ambitious goals and strengthen its capacity \r\nto meet new challenges.\r\nThe first area is Security Council reform. Croatia \r\ncommends the persevering commitment of Member \r\nStates to the ongoing negotiating process and believes \r\nthat broader understanding of sustainability should \r\nfind its place in that context as well. However, any \r\nreform of the Council must not have a negative impact \r\non its ability to perform its main duties and meet its \r\nprimary responsibilities. Enlargement of the Council \r\nis closely connected with the reform of its working \r\nmethods, while the continuing veto powers of the \r\npermanent five continues to raise numerous questions. \r\nThat is why such reform must be comprehensive. \r\nThat having been said, it is Croatia’s position that any \r\nenlargement should take place in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent categories of membership, with \r\none additional non-permanent seat reserved for the \r\ngroup of Eastern European States. That would more \r\nproperly reflect the reality of international relations in \r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nAs a member of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nwe intend to continue advocating a stronger and more \r\nefficient role for that main body in its efforts to seek \r\nsolutions to the most significant social and economic \r\nchallenges of our time. The General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council should also find ways \r\nof working together to support deliberations on the \r\ncomplex matter of sustainable development. Within \r\nits broad, overarching mandate, the General Assembly \r\nremains the central point for all of our discussions. \r\n13-48662 5/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nOur Pacific legacy is not as small island States, \r\nbut as large ocean nations. We are stewards of what \r\nis a truly global resource — our oceans and fisheries. \r\nEven a casual glance at a map reveals a world of deep \r\nand vast blue, and not only scientists but our own local \r\ncommunities see change in our waters. Local and global \r\nocean impacts affect not only every region, but also \r\nglobal food security. I join with other Pacific leaders in \r\nurging dedicated treatment of the oceans as a post-2015 \r\nUnited Nations sustainable development goal.\r\nPacific nations, including the States parties to the \r\nNauru Agreement, are leading the world in changing \r\nfishing practice. We are not only leading the world in \r\nadvancing sustainable fisheries, but at the same time \r\nboosting our own economic growth. Perhaps no other \r\neffort or region is such a strong textbook example of \r\nsustainable development in action. But for all of the \r\nexpressed plenary sympathies and common international \r\nresponsibility, existing legal commitments to safeguard \r\nfisheries all too often fall victim to the short-term \r\ntrade interests of our partners. We Pacific leaders \r\nwill sacrifice neither our resources nor our growth or \r\nlivelihood for quick returns; our future generations are \r\nnot for sale. The threat of harmful fisheries sanctions \r\nfrom distant fishing nations — perhaps as punishment \r\nfor our conservation efforts — is hardly a helping hand \r\neither to our regional development or to international \r\nfood security.\r\nNext year’s international meeting on small island \r\nStates and development partnerships, to be held in \r\nSamoa, will offer our political partners a moment for \r\ncareful reflection. Is the global thirst for rare earth \r\nminerals beneath our waves and is the hunger for \r\nour vast fisheries so great as to outstrip our rightful \r\neconomic development and our conservation efforts? \r\nPerhaps it is high time that island leaders set forward \r\nour island vision of partnership and collaborate \r\naccordingly. We cannot forge progress through political \r\nwill alone. Here, Pacific Islands Forum leaders have \r\nforged a ground-breaking mutual dialogue to enhance \r\nand improve effective United Nations partnerships in \r\nour region. Those are not isolated words; already, the \r\nUnited Nations, together with our bilateral partners, is \r\nplaying a valuable role in working with the Marshall \r\nIslands to recover from a climate-driven drought and \r\nother coastal f looding emergencies.\r\nBut we need not wait for disasters. In every sector \r\nof basic development and environmental efforts, our \r\ndoor is open for increased collaboration among the \r\ngrowing insecurity within Syria. As autumn sets in, it \r\nis evident that efforts are falling short. \r\nThis year, leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nexpressed strong concern about the use of chemical \r\nweapons by the Syrian Government and called for \r\nleadership on the part of the members of the Security \r\nCouncil to resolve that threat. While I am optimistic \r\nabout recent diplomatic developments, the common \r\ninternational voice may come too little and too late for \r\nwhat could have already been prevented. That is only \r\none example of a growing list of the tragic human costs \r\nof inaction. How many more mistakes will the world \r\nmake in distant conference rooms? For how long can we \r\nturn a blind eye to realities and headlines?\r\nPacific nations are now dedicated to changing \r\nthe pace. This month, Pacific Islands Forum leaders \r\nadopted the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership. \r\nAlthough many of our States are small, the common \r\nresponsibility to act falls on all Governments and \r\npersons, no matter how different we are. \r\nThe Marshall Islands is well on track to achieve \r\nthe complete solarization of our outer islands — a goal \r\nwe are meeting with assistance from Japan’s Pacific \r\nEnvironment Community funds and from the European \r\nUnion, Taiwan, Italy, France and other donor partners. \r\nThe entire region is also aggressively cutting its \r\nemissions through the Pacific New Energy Drive. The \r\nmessage to our partners, the world’s largest emitters, is \r\nclear. If we can do it, they can too. Climate change is \r\na risk that demands direct political ownership, and it is \r\nhigh time that other leaders stand alongside the Pacific \r\nin showing the statesmanship so urgently needed. \r\nSimply repeating well-worn negotiation slogans has not \r\ngot the world anywhere. It is time for new solutions. I \r\nstrongly urge my fellow leaders to engage eye to eye \r\nat the Secretary-General’s climate summit next year. \r\nNever has the need for true statesmanship been as dire.\r\nGlobal efforts on climate change are falling short, \r\nand low-lying island nations, such as mine, are already \r\npaying the earliest costs of what is fast becoming a \r\nglobal crisis. In every sense, the world must build for \r\nfuture risks, and we are still setting course based on \r\ncurrent conditions, as is often the case. It is the seas \r\nthat are rising — not the islands that are sinking. I will \r\nnot concede my own land or my nation; nor will I rest \r\nuntil my fellow world leaders have signed on to act, not \r\njust out of economic convenience, but out of a common \r\nresponsibility of all to strive for upward momentum.\r\n6/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nof the Republic of the Marshall Islands for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Christopher J. Loeak, President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Teodoro \r\nObiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of the Republic \r\nof Equatorial Guinea, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We bring to this sixty-eighth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the fraternal and friendly greetings \r\nof the people of Equatorial Guinea. We also bring our \r\nfervent desire for peace and prosperity for all countries \r\nin the world at this difficult time, when the international \r\ncommunity has to deal with major challenges that are \r\nthwarting the aspirations of the peoples for well-being \r\nand happiness.\r\nMay I also extend my congratulations to Mr. John \r\nWilliam Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on his election \r\nto preside over the work of the General Assembly at \r\nthis session. We wish him all the very best and every \r\nsuccess in his difficult task, and we assure him of our \r\nsupport and cooperation. We would also like to thank \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for the excellent work \r\nhe carried out and the dynamic style with which he \r\npresided over the work of the Assembly at its previous \r\nsession.\r\nThis sixty-eighth session is beginning its work on \r\na tragic note, namely, the criminal and barbaric attack \r\nagainst innocent people in Kenya. It was an attack on \r\na supermarket, a mall, which is a peaceful gathering \r\nplace for people, which reflects the criminality of the \r\nperpetrators. Equatorial Guinea strongly condemns \r\nthe heinous attack against the freedom and dignity \r\nof the Kenyan people, which also retards its national \r\nUnited Nations, our regional resources and bilateral \r\npartners. The statements of sympathy in the plenary are \r\nall too often not translated into effective, island-tailored \r\nresults. Our in-country United Nations presence still \r\nhas a long way to go in truly delivering as one and \r\nbetter addressing pressing threats. I encourage a direct \r\ndiscussion between the United Nations and our region \r\non practical efforts to enhance in-country effectiveness \r\nand collaboration. No one people or nation should be \r\npassed over.\r\nEven as the United Nations enters into a new \r\ndiscussion in setting the stage for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, improved progress towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) remains \r\nno less a priority. I would also like to recognize the \r\ncontributions that Taiwan has made in helping my \r\ncountry in efforts to achieve the MDGs.\r\nPacific Islands Forum leaders have, for the first \r\ntime, recognized the role of the United Nations in \r\nauthorizing nuclear-weapon testing during the Cold \r\nWar and welcomed the recommendations of the \r\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur’s recent report \r\n(A/HRC/21/48/Add.1). Nuclear testing in the Marshall \r\nIslands is no mere historical event, but an international \r\nlegacy that will stay with us for generations. While the \r\nbulk of the unmet responsibilities still rest with our \r\nhistorical Administering Power, the United States, the \r\nUnited Nations can, for its part, no longer ignore its \r\nown role during the Trusteeship era. \r\nI am strongly encouraged by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s commitment to addressing the ongoing \r\nimpacts of nuclear testing in the Pacific and look \r\nforward to practical steps in that regard.\r\nMy Government is gratified to note \r\nthat — with solid international support and cross-\r\nstrait cooperation — the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nhas increased its meaningful participation in United \r\nNations specialized agencies and mechanisms. We will \r\ncontinue to encourage positive interaction between the \r\ntwo sides of the Taiwan Strait in the international arena.\r\nToo often, despite our own aspirations, we struggle \r\nto move inches when urgency demands miles. We wish \r\nto inform the Secretary-General that our political will \r\nstands ready and that our hands are extended for a \r\ndurable partnership.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\n13-48662 7/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia, for presiding over \r\nthe special session of the General Assembly held in \r\nApril of this year on the peaceful resolution of conflicts \r\nin Africa.\r\nEquatorial Guinea’s political, economic and \r\nsociocultural situation is positive and encouraging, \r\nbecause our country enjoys productive peace and \r\nstability and harmonious political development and is \r\nconsolidating a genuine national democracy. All of that \r\nhas allowed us to carry out significant infrastructure \r\nwork, enabling the people to participate directly in the \r\ncountry’s overall growth. The Government, together \r\nwith all the political institutions, is carrying out major \r\npolitical reforms, thanks to the agreements reached in \r\nthe binding national political pact, which was signed \r\nwith all the country’s political groups and which \r\nestablishes standards for the political conduct of all \r\nstakeholders and their participation in public affairs \r\nadministration. Happily, the people of Equatorial \r\nGuinea are aware of the changes in the areas benefiting \r\nthem, and they recognize and support them.\r\nAt the international level, we are very concerned \r\nabout the negative effects of the so-called humanitarian \r\ninterference from the United Nations, which, far from \r\nensuring the human rights and well-being of the peoples \r\naffected, is more focused on imposing political systems \r\nand democracy based on unacknowledged interests. That \r\ninterference is being carried out in total disregard of the \r\nsacred principles of national sovereignty and the dignity \r\nof peoples. Democracy is indeed the ultimate expression \r\nof natural law; it is also an act of the people’s sovereign \r\nwill. We have never seen any country in the world \r\naccept democracy when it was imposed on it. And why \r\nhas it now become the excuse for intervening through \r\nforce in conflicts within self-governing countries? That \r\nrepresents a provocation against our peoples, who are \r\nbeing deceived in the name of democracy, while the \r\nfundamental attributes of independence and national \r\nsovereignty are disregarded, provoking civil disorder, \r\nwhich leads to loss of life, social divisiveness and the \r\ndestruction of basic infrastructure, which is difficult \r\nto rebuild. We see, therefore, that everything is easily \r\ntraced to the neocolonialist activities of certain parties \r\nthat wish to recover the resources that nature reserved \r\nfor our countries.\r\nEquatorial Guinea understands and agrees that \r\nsecurity and development are an essential whole, and \r\nwe affirm that peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights are intrinsically bound together, which is \r\ndevelopment and violates its freedoms. I convey \r\nour condolences and a feeling of solidarity to the \r\nGovernment of Kenya and the families of the victims. \r\nWe also call on the United Nations to take severe \r\nmeasures against crimes of that nature.\r\nAlthough the international community has become \r\nincreasingly conscious of the importance of peace, we \r\nstill see, unfortunately, that the United Nations has not \r\nyet achieved its main objectives, namely, a peaceful \r\nand developed world, one ensuring the dignity and \r\nwell-being of all peoples in the world. Thus, despite the \r\nmajor efforts that have been made over the past 68 years, \r\npeace is still as yet an unrealized dream in many parts \r\nof the world. The sovereign equality of all States can be \r\nseen only in declarations of principles. Economic and \r\nsocial development has not yet been achieved by most \r\nStates, and the principles of cooperation for mutual \r\nbenefit are being undermined in international relations.\r\nAt the same time, in addition to that disturbing \r\nsituation, we see an increase in natural disasters, wars, \r\nterrorism and acts of violence, which take human lives \r\nand force large groups of populations from their homes. \r\nHunger haunts almost three quarters of the world’s \r\npopulation, and there are still major endemic diseases \r\nthat cause many deaths in less developed countries: \r\nthey affect in particular the most vulnerable segments \r\nof society.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of that difficult political, \r\neconomic and sociocultural situation around the world, \r\nEquatorial Guinea would like to acknowledge the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to preserve the noble \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and to \r\nseek to achieve the goals set forth therein. However, the \r\nalmost incomprehensible ideological tenor of relations \r\namong States creates almost a kind of cold war between \r\nthose that proclaim themselves moral authorities and a \r\nmajority that want freedom of action to determine the \r\nfutures of their peoples.\r\nAs far as the Republic of Equatorial Guinea is \r\nconcerned, questions of the peace and security of \r\nStates should be given full priority and consideration \r\nby the United Nations, since without peace, there can \r\nbe no development, and without development it would \r\nbe difficult to ensure human beings’ dignity, integrity \r\nand freedom. For that reason, we firmly support \r\nthe principle of the peaceful settlement of conflicts \r\nthrough negotiation, mediation and arbitration. In \r\nthat connection, we would like to commend and \r\nacknowledge the efforts of Mr. Tomislav Nikolić, \r\n8/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nthat the attention of the General Assembly should be \r\nfocused on the normalization of relations among States, \r\nnot only by adopting appropriate standards, but even \r\nmore by ensuring that our States apply them.\r\nWhile the African continent and other developing \r\ncountries strive to move towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment, they are unfortunately diverted from \r\ntheir efforts and forced to address man-made conflicts \r\nthat are fuelled by the surreal approaches to freedom, \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights in Africa that \r\ncertain Powers are promoting. We are not convinced \r\nthat the United Nations has adopted a particular model \r\nof democracy that is applicable to all States. Africa is \r\nmore in need of special attention from the international \r\ncommunity to ensure its security, since it is now a \r\nbreeding ground for terrorist operations, mercenaries, \r\npirates and organized crime, due to the fragility of its \r\nstructures.\r\nThe United Nations should not cling to methods \r\nand practices that do not resolve conflict or meet the \r\ndesires of the people — or even worse, are a burden \r\nfor them. We are referring here to the use of force and \r\nembargoes, which always inflict great suffering on the \r\naffected peoples and deprive them of their most basic \r\nrights. That was not the purpose for which the United \r\nNations was established. We therefore call for the \r\nlifting of the embargoes imposed on the Republic of \r\nCuba and the Republic of Zimbabwe, as they harm the \r\nlives of their peoples.\r\nWith respect to armed conflict, the conflict between \r\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians has demonstrated the \r\ninability of the United Nations to impose solutions \r\nduring armed hostilities. However, we believe that \r\npolitically influential countries of the Middle East \r\ncan and should play a prominent role as arbitrators \r\nand mediators between the parties to the conflict. The \r\nsolutions have already been laid out by the United \r\nNations, and all that is needed is to implement them \r\nby ensuring respect for the limits set in 1967, because \r\nboth countries must coexist and need clearly defined \r\nborders.\r\nRegarding the situation in Syria, we regret \r\nand condemn the use of chemical weapons and the \r\nescalation of violence fuelled by opaque interests that \r\nare decimating a people because of alleged internal \r\nproblems. Wars have always bequeathed a negative \r\nbalance, and their victims tend to always be innocent \r\npeople. That is why we ask for an immediate cessation of \r\nhostilities and the withdrawal of the countries involved \r\nwhy we disagree with the argument that indiscriminate \r\ndestruction can be planned in order to then introduce \r\nreconstruction and reconciliation at somebody else’s \r\nexpense. In that belief and in the face of such hidden and \r\ncomplex plans, I am pleased to declare before this world \r\nforum that Equatorial Guinea and its Government are \r\nwilling to host the next session of the United Nations \r\nStanding Advisory Committee on Security Questions \r\nin Central Africa, at a suitable date to be agreed on by \r\nthe parties.\r\nUncoordinated actions such as those I mentioned, \r\nwhich worsen global insecurity, are being carried out \r\ntoday, while the United Nations — whose role as arbiter \r\nand conciliator is being openly f louted by special \r\ninterests — looks on, powerless. Let us be honest with \r\nourselves, because democracy, as a just and equitable \r\nsystem, should prevail in all the organs of the United \r\nNations system, the epicentre of the international \r\ncommunity, aspiring to peace, order and development. \r\nWe therefore have no alternative but to reform those \r\norgans, particularly the Security Council, in order to \r\nmake them more democratic, so that they can protect \r\nthe interests of every nation impartially.\r\nWithin the framework of efforts to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the level of basic \r\ninfrastructure that has been created and the policy of \r\npromoting social institutions in Equatorial Guinea have \r\nresulted in a drop in the number of cases of malaria \r\nand in infant and maternal morbidity and mortality; in \r\nlower illiteracy rates; better technical and professional \r\ntraining; the increased empowerment of women; the \r\ngradual integration of persons with disabilities and a \r\nrise in the well-being of the people. Equatorial Guinea \r\nis contributing and collaborating actively with its \r\nNorth American partners, Noble Energy, Marathon and \r\nSanaria, with a view to completely eliminating malaria \r\nthrough the development of a vaccine that will be ready \r\nfor official use in 2017.\r\nIn order to work towards the main objective of \r\nthe theme for this session, which is “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage”, Equatorial \r\nGuinea has adopted a development programme aimed \r\nat reaching the goals of an emerging country by 2020, \r\nwhich is now our priority. We therefore believe that \r\nEquatorial Guinea should move up gradually from its \r\nstatus as a least-developed country in order to achieve \r\nthat new rank in 2020.\r\nWhile that is the central theme of this session, \r\nto which we all must give our support, we also note \r\n13-48662 9/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. \r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe United Nations for its unwavering support to \r\nSomalia. On 10 September 2012, when I was elected \r\nPresident of Somalia, it was the first time that we \r\nhad had a permanent Government following 22 years \r\nwithout a functioning State. Somalia could not have \r\ncompleted the transition last year without the assistance \r\nof the United Nations and all the countries that stood \r\nwith us during those difficult times.\r\nOne of the main purposes of the United Nations is \r\nto maintain international peace and security. Therefore, \r\nit is imperative that we stand together to ensure that \r\nthe world is peaceful and stable. Somalia and other \r\ncountries are still suffering and need the support \r\nof friends, allies and all members of this body, who \r\nmust come together to find ways to overcome all the \r\nchallenges that exist in this universe. \r\nIt is time to reflect on our collective progress and \r\nthe challenges and opportunities before us in our efforts \r\nto ensure that the world is free from conflict. I have no \r\ndoubt that if we collectively work hard and understand \r\nthe issue, become self-critical with our strategies and \r\nprovide all the necessary support and assistance to \r\nall countries that are struggling to bring peace and \r\nstability, we will prevail in achieving our main purpose \r\nin that universe. That struggle must be redoubled. \r\nWe strongly condemn the cruel and terrible attack \r\nin Nairobi’s Westgate Mall and send our condolences to \r\nthe Kenyan people and the Government. The Westgate \r\nshopping mall attack in Nairobi demonstrates to the \r\nworld a number of important points.\r\nFirst, the battle against Al-Qaieda and its offshoots, \r\nsuch as Al-Shabaab in the Horn of Africa, is far from \r\nover. Al-Shabaab is indeed a national threat, but its \r\nconsequences have negative impacts on the region and \r\nthe entire world, not just for Somalia alone.\r\nSecondly, the fight against Al-Shabaab must be \r\nfought on many fronts — military, economic, political \r\nand ideological. Military, security and intelligence \r\nforces are crucial elements in the battle, but they are \r\nonly one part of the solution.\r\nThirdly, Al-Shabaab is down but it has not died. \r\nWe now need the tools to finish the job, and we call on \r\nour friends to remain resolute and to help us end the \r\nsituation. Our brave Somali forces, the African Union \r\nin the conflict, in order to honour and respect the Syrian \r\npeople and fulfil the United Nations responsibility to \r\nmaintain peace and security around the world. The only \r\ninterventions should be pacification and the destruction \r\nof chemical weapons, which the United Nations must \r\ndemand of the Syrian Government.\r\nRepetition implies concern, and indeed, in its \r\ncreation and in the framework of its Charter, the \r\nUnited Nations is seriously committed to maintaining \r\npeace and security in the world. It is also committed \r\nto promoting economic development, moral, human \r\nand material welfare, and relations of friendship, trust \r\nand cooperation among nations. But far from achieving \r\nthese goals, we continue to experience the horrors of \r\nwar on a daily basis, and to allow people to go hungry \r\nand nations to continue to live with the threat of \r\ninstability and espionage.\r\nIt is high time for us to stop this global misery in its \r\ntracks and look to our past while moving forward in a \r\nspirit of solidarity to forge a world that fulfils the hopes \r\nof humankind for well-being and happiness.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nTeodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Somalia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Federal Republic of Somalia.\r\nMr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hassan \r\nSheikh Mohamud, President of the Federal Republic of \r\nSomalia, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mohamud: It is an honour for me to be \r\nhere today, as this it is my first time addressing this \r\nesteemed and respected body, the General Assembly, \r\nas President of Somalia. First, let me congratulate the \r\n10/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\ninstitutions that are respectful of the fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms and equality of its citizens.\r\nTo succeed, the New Deal must be more than words \r\nand frameworks. It must deliver on the ground. There are \r\nhuge expectations that the compact will revolutionize \r\nthe service-delivery efforts of the Government. We \r\nneed to transform the lives of our people, connect \r\nwith our citizens and enhance their well-being. In the \r\nmeantime, we have started a campaign to revitalize \r\nservice delivery in districts and regions throughout \r\nSomalia, to provide health care, and to enable access \r\nto clean water. We have launched, for the first time, an \r\ninitiative called “Go to School”. Under its auspices, we \r\nare planning to enrol 100,000 students in the schools \r\nin the current academic year, and 1 million students \r\nwill eventually be in school within the coming three \r\nyears. That is not without challenges, but we commit \r\nourselves and we will prevail.\r\nOn the other hand, I would like to present to the \r\nAssembly the political progress that we are making in \r\nSomalia. We believe that a political solution is the first \r\nstep in building a stable governance framework in our \r\ncountry. We have begun to lay the foundations for the \r\nreturn of effective, stable and representative governance \r\nin Somalia, the cornerstone of lasting peace.\r\nTo that end, Somalia should possess a full-\r\nf ledged constitution reflecting a broad national \r\nconsensus on how we wish to govern ourselves. We \r\nmust complete the establishment of our federal system \r\nand advance the process of democratization through \r\nthe development of a multiparty electoral system. \r\nAccordingly, our Parliament has already passed \r\nlegislation establishing an independent Constitutional \r\nReview and Implementation Commission, as required \r\nby the provisional Constitution. We must move quickly \r\nto put in place other critical statutory bodies, including \r\na boundaries and federation commission and a national \r\nindependent electoral commission, the tasks of which \r\nwill be to guide our thinking and inform our actions \r\nand decisions in order to complete Somalia’s journey to \r\nunity, stability and democracy.\r\nIn March, my Government signed an agreement \r\nwith the authorities in Puntland, framing our shared \r\ncommitment to implementing a federal system of \r\ngovernance, as agreed. On 27 August, we signed an \r\naccord that establishes an interim Juba Administration, \r\nwhich also aspires to become a federal member state \r\nin accordance with the Constitution. The agreement, \r\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Ethiopian forces \r\nneed help in fighting our enemies inside Somalia, yet \r\nthat is simply not enough. AMISOM must be reinforced \r\nand expanded. The small investment required for those \r\nenhancements is insignificant compared with the great \r\nexpense that will be needed later if the international \r\ncommunity does not help finish the job right now. \r\nFurthermore, we must not overreact but remain focused \r\non weakening and uprooting the terrorist bases, \r\nmilitarily and ideologically. In doing so, we must not \r\nunderestimate them, nor should we overestimate them \r\nand fall for their childish, irresponsible and useless \r\npropaganda.\r\nThose brutal terrorist organizations, wherever they \r\nmay be — in Nairobi, Mogadishu or elsewhere in the \r\nworld — have no mercy for humankind. But I reassure \r\nthe Assembly that we will fight and defeat Al-Shabaab \r\nin the deserts and in the towns, on digital and on social \r\nmedia. We will fight them on the airwaves and in the \r\nnewspapers. We challenge them in schools, colleges \r\nand universities, and we will overcome them. We have \r\ndefeated them militarily on the battlefield, and we must \r\nnow defeat their poisonous ideology with innovative \r\nstrategies, cutting-edge technologies, comprehensive \r\neducation and vigorous communication. That is the \r\ncommitment that we will fulfil, and I call on our partners \r\nto remain strong and stand shoulder to shoulder with \r\nKenya and with Somalia. Only if we remain resolute \r\nand together will we prevail.\r\nIn just one year, the cornerstones of a new Somalia \r\nhave been successfully and peacefully laid down. We \r\nhave made milestone achievements in security, public \r\nfinance management, reconciliation, political outreach \r\nand laying the foundations of good governance \r\nwith appropriate legislation in place. The federal \r\nGovernment of Somalia has now established the basis \r\nof a new public finance management system, which \r\nwe believe will enable our donors to agree to funding \r\narrangements with the confidence that funds will reach \r\ntheir intended recipients.\r\nThat is at the heart of the New Deal compact we \r\nsigned in Brussels earlier this month. The compact \r\nrepresents a paradigm shift in how the international \r\ncommunity engages with Somalia, and I welcome \r\nthat transformation wholeheartedly. The New Deal \r\nwill help Somalia preserve its unity and sovereignty \r\nand lay a strong foundation, 22 years on, for building \r\nreliable, transparent and accountable functioning State \r\n13-48662 11/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nFinally, people may ask why Somalia matters at this \r\ntime, but there is a huge amount at stake right now — the \r\nfuture of our country, the security of the region and the \r\nwider world, in the light, in particular, of the war against \r\nAl-Qaida in Somalia and the removal of the piracy \r\nstranglehold on the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean, \r\nwhich are indeed challenges that we share with the \r\nworld. The progress that has been made in Somalia on \r\nthose critical issues over the past years would not have \r\nbeen possible without the courageous support of the \r\nmember countries of the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development, the African Union through its troop-\r\ncontributing countries, and the ultimate sacrifice made \r\nby many brave African soldiers. We pay tribute to them, \r\nand we owe it to their memory to ensure that we do not \r\ntake a single step backwards.\r\nI would equally like to thank the European Union \r\nfor its leadership in organizing the recent conference in \r\nBrussels. I would also like to thank the Member States \r\nthat not only made the commitment to take part in the \r\nmeeting, but also showed great generosity in making \r\npledges to help the development and reconstruction of \r\nSomalia. We hope that others will do as they have done.\r\nWe welcome the new United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Somalia (UNSOM), with which we are now \r\nworking to bring peace and stability to the country. \r\nUNSOM is doing a great job, and we look forward to \r\naddressing all outstanding issues together. UNSOM \r\nhas shown a commitment to bringing its offices back to \r\nSomalia. Tragically, the extremists, who are terrified of \r\nprogress, were able to kill innocent people in an attack \r\nagainst the United Nations compound in Mogadishu. \r\nI offer my sincere condolences to the United Nations \r\nand the families of the victims. The United Nations \r\nhas reacted mindfully and reiterated its support for \r\nSomalia. I thank the Organization for that courage and \r\ncommitment.\r\nWar is something we Somalis have experienced too \r\nmuch of in recent years, and we feel particular sadness \r\nwhen we look at Syria and see our brothers embarking \r\non a civil war that will only bring the ruin of the country. \r\nIt is much easier to start a war than to end one. After \r\ntwo years, the conflict in Syria is already entrenched. \r\nHatred has taken hold of the hearts of too many men \r\nand women, while a new generation of children has to \r\nendure a childhood full of suffering, with no education.\r\nAs a Somali who has lived through the world’s \r\nlongest, most devastating civil war, I can speak with \r\nachieved after long months of painstaking negotiations, \r\ndemonstrates what can be achieved through the \r\ncombination of Somali political leadership and the \r\nsteadfast support of our close neighbours.\r\nWe have begun similar processes elsewhere \r\nin Somalia, establishing interim administrations \r\nin the remaining regions to pursue the twin goals \r\nof peacebuilding and State-building across many \r\nregions in Somalia. Members of Parliament have also \r\nplayed a key role in all of those processes, working \r\nwith their constituencies and serving as a critical \r\nchannel of communication between the people of their \r\nconstituencies and the federal Government.\r\nWith the good offices of the Government of Turkey, \r\nwe have continued our dialogue with the authorities in \r\nSomaliland, underscoring our determination to preserve \r\nthe unity of the country, not by force and coercion, but \r\nthrough dialogue, mutual respect and understanding. \r\nSomali unity must be more than a rhetorical device; \r\nit must preserve and promote the dignity, equality \r\nand legitimate aspirations of all Somali citizens. By \r\nadhering to such principles, we are confident that our \r\ndialogue with Somaliland will not only continue, but \r\nwill eventually bear fruit.\r\nThose are major milestones, but enormous \r\nchallenges still lie ahead. These challenges were \r\nclearly articulated by the participants at the Vision 2016 \r\nConference convened on 2 September in Mogadishu, \r\nwhere some of the best minds in the country and from \r\nSomali communities living abroad came together \r\nto offer their remarkable experience, insights and \r\nexpertise in charting the way forward for the future \r\nof Somalia. At another major gathering just last week \r\nin Mogadishu, respected Somali religious leaders \r\nand elders from across the country announced their \r\ndetermination to have a future free from the intolerance \r\nand extremism that have taken root in recent years.\r\nWe are committed to ensuring that, in the course \r\nof the daily struggle to rebuild our country, we do not \r\nlose sight of the longer-term challenges ahead. We \r\nare announcing the Vision 2016 initiative, which is \r\na concerted effort under my leadership to complete \r\nthe Constitution, organize the federal system and \r\nprepare the ground for elections in 2016. We will need \r\ndirection, determination, discipline and human and \r\nfinancial resources if we are to succeed as we roll out \r\nthe concrete objectives and benchmarks set forth in the \r\ninitiative.\r\n12/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nNhamadjo, Interim President of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nhamadjo (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would like to begin \r\nmy statement by congratulating Ambassador John \r\nWilliam Ashe on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. I would also like to \r\nextend our congratulations to his country, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, which is honoured by the selection of one of \r\nits sons to preside this year over the most representative \r\nworld institution. \r\nThe President carries on his shoulders the \r\nresponsibility for guiding the work of the current session \r\nof the General Assembly at a time that all consider to be \r\npolitically very critical for the international community. \r\nIndeed, the reality that the international community \r\nfaces today is that of a world troubled by dangerous \r\nglobal geopolitical tensions and an international \r\nfinancial and economic crisis that is deeper and wider \r\nthan any we have seen since the 1930s. The intensity \r\nof the crisis has thrown millions of people onto the \r\nunemployment rolls and created millions of new poor \r\nthroughout the world. \r\nThere are new fears, new dangers and new threats \r\naround the world — from transnational terrorism \r\nto arms and drug trafficking as well as frightening \r\ninterfaith tensions that often result in bloodshed. Other \r\ndangers include the return of brutal, old-style piracy \r\nto the modern age, not only off the coast of Somalia \r\nbut also in the Gulf of Guinea, threatening important \r\nroutes through which oil is transported to fuel the world \r\neconomy, creating insecurity for the international \r\nmerchant marine and facilitating illicit fishing and \r\nall manner of illegal maritime trafficking in arms, \r\nhuman beings and psychotropic substances; persistent \r\noutbreaks of ethnic violence that cause enormous \r\nhuman suffering; and unimaginable humanitarian \r\ndisasters in various areas.\r\nI come from a small country on the westernmost tip \r\nof the African coast. We are a poor country, but we have \r\nnot lost the hope of achieving, in peace, the progress \r\nto which we are entitled. Two days ago we celebrated \r\nthe fortieth anniversary of our national independence, \r\nso this is a good time for us to reaffirm the following: \r\nduring the entire period of armed struggle for national \r\nliberation, the people that I represent believed in the \r\nUnited Nations and in international law, and my country \r\nbitter experience of the legacies of war. We must not \r\nallow the use of chemical weapons against human beings \r\nin war or otherwise, let alone against children, women \r\nand vulnerable people. The international community \r\nmust assume its responsibility and send a powerful \r\nmassage to those who are responsible for the continued \r\nconflict in Syria. We must continue to encourage all \r\nsides in Syria and their international allies to realize \r\nthat the only way out of the tragedy is dialogue and \r\nnegotiation.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me reiterate that impunity has \r\nno place in the world, but selective justice and targeted \r\ntrials are against the principles of peace, justice and \r\nreconciliation. Regrettably, the trials of African leaders \r\nat the International Criminal Court have become \r\npolitically motivated, in contravention of agreed \r\nobjectives and principles. As a result, the wounds of \r\nconflict remain unhealed and the national unity and \r\ncohesion of many African countries is jeopardized.\r\nI would like to conclude by thanking the General \r\nAssembly and paying tribute to the dedicated support \r\nof its members. Together we can make Somalia strong \r\nagain. We have planted the seeds of a new Somalia. \r\nWe wish to see it grow into a tree standing tall in the \r\nAfrican bush, with deep roots binding it securely to its \r\nregion and offering shade and protection to its people \r\nas they rebuild their lives.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Federal Republic of Somalia for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, Interim \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Interim \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, Interim President of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Manuel Serifo \r\n13-48662 13/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\ndegradation of the political situation in my country in \r\norder to justify their views, confirm their predictions \r\nand operationalize their political concepts of how to \r\nresolve the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Indeed, they made \r\nevery attempt to apply the formula of “the worse for \r\nGuinea-Bissau, the better” — the better to serve their \r\nown interests. With such a radical position, they were \r\ntruly able to touch the deepest sensibilities of a people \r\nthat is humble but refuses to be humiliated.\r\nWe are a true democracy, notwithstanding all our \r\nf laws, the violations of the democratic purpose of the \r\nState and the many detours taken. We are the first to \r\nrecognize that. But we must not forget that we are, first, \r\na State born out of centuries of pain and hope and of a \r\nhard and victorious struggle for national independence, \r\nwhich has had a strong influence on the determination \r\nof the political values to be defended.\r\nIn order to enable the second option on the table \r\nto go forward, we were able to rely on the realism \r\nand prompt solidarity of the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States (ECOWAS). With the important \r\nsupport of the Security Council, ECOWAS became \r\nsolely responsible for managing the agreed transition \r\nperiod and created a reduced stabilization military \r\nmission that became known as the ECOWAS Mission \r\nin Guinea-Bissau.\r\nAt the political and institutional levels, the \r\nparliament elected by the people of Guinea-Bissau — the \r\nNational People’s Assembly — remained standing and \r\nthus was able to provide the political transition with a \r\nlegitimate and legitimizing institutional basis. In fact, \r\nthe Constitution of the Republic was never suspended.\r\nThat is the origin of the office of the Interim \r\nPresident of the Republic. It did not come from a military \r\ncoup. It came, rather, from an elected Parliament and \r\ntherefore from a political and institutional process. \r\nThat makes all the difference.\r\nMr. Deng (South Sudan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nI combined the position of Member of Parliament, \r\nelected to the position four times in a row, with that \r\nof First Vice-President of that body of sovereignty: in \r\nother words, all modesty aside, I am a democrat with a \r\nmature conviction and never carried out a coup d’état or \r\nordered any such action.\r\nIndeed, with the inauguration of the Interim \r\nPresident of the Republic, the political transition process \r\ntoday reiterates, maintains and further reinforces that \r\nbelief.\r\nWe achieved national independence in 1973. It was \r\nnot given to us by anybody but became possible only \r\nas a result of the international solidarity of some and, \r\nultimately, the recognition of all. \r\nTo all without exception, I wish, on behalf of Guinea-\r\nBissau, to express our feeling of eternal gratitude, to \r\ndeclare our firm desire to strengthen longstanding ties \r\nof friendship and to affirm our willingness, despite \r\nall that has transpired, to rebuild the foundations of \r\nsolidarity that united our peoples in the past.\r\nFrom this rostrum I ask for the Assembly’s patience \r\nand understanding and hope for its solidarity. I believe \r\nthat expressions of generosity are in no way inconsistent \r\nwith the cold rationality of relations among sovereign \r\nStates. I am the Interim President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, and that title, as the Assembly is well \r\naware, indicates something particular and exceptional.\r\nIndeed, the political and military events of 12 April \r\n2012 created a new political environment in my country. \r\nA military coup had ousted the interim President of the \r\nRepublic and a self-suspended Prime Minister who \r\nhad launched an inconclusive campaign to run for the \r\npresidency. Faced with that situation, we wondered \r\nwhat to do.\r\nFortunately, the best option available at the time, in \r\nour opinion, ultimately prevailed. We were able to avoid \r\npolitical problems that, had they taken hold, could have \r\nthrown the country into a political and military tailspin \r\nwith consequences that would have been unpredictable \r\nand certainly much graver than those we nonetheless \r\nhad to face and, in some ways, continue to face.\r\nWe therefore had to circumscribe the dynamics of \r\nthe military coup, control its political effects and limit \r\nits institutional reach, and, as if that were not enough, \r\nwe had to deal with two opposing positions that emerged \r\nboth internally and abroad.\r\nOne of them was deeply detrimental to the peaceful \r\nreturn to constitutional normality in my country, but \r\nthe other was much more realistic and thus more \r\npromising in terms of the gradual re-establishment \r\nof constitutional order. We had to deal with the first \r\nso-called position, which was both curious and \r\ndramatic. That position was taken by people who \r\nwould have preferred to see the worst possible situation \r\nin Guinea-Bissau. Why? They were betting on the \r\n14/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\ndeveloped countries, our partners, will do their part in \r\nthe fight against poverty, one of the greatest scourges \r\naff licting States such as Guinea-Bissau, which are very \r\nfragile and therefore very vulnerable, and still suffering \r\nfrom the grave consequences of armed conflict.\r\nGuinea-Bissau supports the establishment on \r\n24 September of the High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development. It replaces the Commission \r\non Sustainable Development and will develop the \r\nUnited Nations post-2015 development agenda. As a \r\ncountry of many islands, Guinea-Bissau welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to convene the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, in Samoa, in September 2014.\r\nWe take this opportunity to thank the United \r\nNations, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in \r\nparticular, for their dedication to our country and for \r\nappointing former President of Timor-Leste José Ramos-\r\nHorta as United Nations Special Representative and \r\nHead of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \r\nOffice in Guinea-Bissau. Mr. Ramos-Horta has made \r\nexcellent contributions to the political normalization of \r\nour country. \r\nThe State of Guinea-Bissau is not oblivious to the \r\nevolution of the international political environment. \r\nGuinea-Bissau has never been indifferent to the hopes \r\nand suffering of people all over the world. In that \r\nregard, we stand firm in solidarity with our brothers \r\nin ECOWAS. We wish the people of Mali the best of \r\nluck. Mali has just demonstrated its immense maturity \r\nby going to the polls during recent general elections \r\nwith civic pride, marking the end of a period of political \r\ntransition. That also sent a strong starting signal \r\nfor national reconciliation and efforts to rebuild the \r\ncountry, which was destroyed by acts of terrorism and \r\nunacceptable irredentism. We take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate France on its crucial role in safeguarding \r\nthe integrity of Malian territory, which is the foundation \r\nof the country’s sovereignty.\r\nWe repudiate the terrorist attacks that have taken \r\nplace in Nigeria and Kenya, spurred by radicalism in \r\nthe name of religious intolerance. We offer our full \r\nsupport to the sister nations of Nigeria and Kenya, \r\nPresidents Goodluck Jonathan and Uhuru Kenyatta, \r\ntheir Governments and the families of all the victims. \r\nWe hope that neighbouring Guinea undergoes a \r\nsuccessful electoral process, paving the path for true \r\nnational reconciliation in that country. \r\nper se began. After some time, Parliament approved the \r\nrevised transition pact and the corresponding political \r\nagreement. Later on it approved the programme \r\nand general budget for the State, submitted by a \r\nGovernment with a broad political base, which I, as \r\nInterim President of the Republic, had appointed and \r\ninstalled by presidential decree.\r\nWith those steps, the political transition truly \r\ntook off. I have signed a presidential decree setting \r\n24 November as the date for the legislative and \r\npresidential elections. What remains, which is no small \r\ntask, is to ensure the availability of funds to carry out \r\nan effective, transparent and unquestionable electoral \r\nprocess. To that end, we must create reliable voter \r\nregistries, something that can be accomplished only \r\nthrough an accurate census or voter registration process. \r\nThat is where the political transition in Guinea-Bissau \r\nstands.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is the victim of two dramatically \r\ninterlinked evils: poverty and political instability. In \r\na society such as that of my country, poverty creates \r\na propensity for political instability. In turn, political \r\ninstability has an impact on the economic order, \r\nreduces the rate of growth and thus increases the \r\npoverty rate. The challenge ahead consists precisely \r\nof escaping the two traps of poverty and political \r\ninstability. Overcoming this challenge obviously goes \r\nwell beyond the goals for this exceptional period of \r\npolitical transition. Therefore, in that regard, we will \r\nnot go into further detail. \r\nIn the light of this enormous economic and political \r\nliability, which has yet to be resolved, achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals within a given time \r\nframe is truly beyond our means, for the foreseeable \r\nfuture at least. But this recognition does not mean that \r\nthe Government, civil society and Guinea-Bissau’s \r\nbilateral and multilateral development partners \r\nin general, including United Nations specialized \r\nagencies, have given up on the effort. On the contrary, \r\nin education, health, gender-equality policies, the fight \r\nagainst poverty, environmental policies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and other areas, our country has made \r\nprogress, though moderate and below satisfactory \r\nlevels.\r\nWith respect to the outcome document of the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, \r\nentitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, \r\nannex), Guinea-Bissau will make every effort to carry \r\nout the commitments undertaken. We hope that the more \r\n13-48662 15/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\ncountry. The fruits of this cooperation, particularly \r\nin the construction of key public buildings, will enter \r\nhistory as indelible symbols of a friendship that dates \r\nback to our armed struggle for national liberation. \r\nWe express the profound gratitude of the people of \r\nGuinea-Bissau to Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire and current President of \r\nECOWAS, and to Mr. Goodluck Jonathan, President \r\nof the Federal Republic of Nigeria and President of \r\nthe International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau, as \r\nwell as to all the Heads of State and Government of the \r\nmember countries of ECOWAS.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Interim President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has just \r\nmade. \r\nMr. Manuel Serifo Nhamadjo, Interim President of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall. \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. James Wani Igga, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of South Sudan \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan.\r\nMr. James Wani Igga, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. James Wani Igga, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Igga (South Sudan): It is a great honour \r\nfor me to address the Assembly for the first time as \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nFirst, I would like to express the heartfelt \r\ncondolences of the Government and the people of South \r\nSudan to the people and the Government of the Republic \r\nof Kenya, in particular the families of those affected \r\nby the brutal and inhuman act of terror in the Kenyan \r\ncapital, Nairobi. We condemn all acts of terrorism and \r\npledge our full cooperation and support to all efforts \r\nIn Egypt and Syria, which has been ravaged by \r\nwar, we hope that dialogue and diplomacy prevail over \r\nforce, so that we can avoid sacrificing more human \r\nlives. In the Middle East, we continue to defend the \r\nPalestinian cause with as much conviction as ever. It is \r\ncrucial for the Palestinian people in particular, and for \r\npolitical stability and peacebuilding in the Arab world \r\nin general, that negotiations between the Palestinian \r\nauthorities and the State of Israel advance towards the \r\ncreation of a sovereign Palestinian State, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\r\nAs to Europe, we offer a special word of recognition \r\nto France, which has never abandoned us and continues \r\nvery actively to seek better ways of helping Guinea-\r\nBissau overcome a political crisis. We also thank the \r\nKingdom of Spain, whose Ambassador to the United \r\nNations has been instrumental in efforts towards \r\npolitical normalization. Our friend Timor-Leste, a small \r\ncountry within the Community of Portuguese-Speaking \r\nCountries (CPLP), has exhibited an admirable spirit of \r\ncooperation with Guinea-Bissau, demonstrating that \r\nfriends do come through in the most difficult of times. \r\nThe Timorese authorities have understood the very \r\nsimple fact that supporting an institutional process of \r\npolitical normalization is not the same as supporting a \r\ncoup d’état. It is, indeed, quite the contrary. \r\nWe very much thank President Armando \r\nGuebuza, current President of the CPLP, for his fair \r\nassessment of the political process in Guinea-Bissau, \r\nfor his encouragement and for appealing to the \r\ninternational community to provide financial support \r\nfor general elections in Guinea-Bissau. We also take \r\nthis opportunity to congratulate Murade Murargy, \r\na Mozambican national who currently serves as the \r\nExecutive Secretary of CPLP, for his dedication to \r\nthe political normalization process in our country. We \r\nhope one day, and perhaps one day soon, to see a full \r\nnormalization of our relations with the countries of the \r\nCPLP, which is in the interests of all our peoples and \r\nsovereign States. \r\nWith respect to Cuba, we call, as we have always \r\ndone, for an end to the decades-long embargo and \r\nfor the advancement of the reforms under way in that \r\nfriendly nation, with which we have so many and such \r\ndeep ties of friendship and solidarity.\r\nWith respect to Asia, we wish to express our \r\nprofound gratitude to the People’s Republic of China \r\nfor the extent and intensity of its cooperation with our \r\n16/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\npicture of how well the country is run in our nine other \r\nstates besides Jonglei.\r\nWe are presently running a Government with \r\nacceptable standards of competence. A decentralized \r\nsystem of governance is the outcome of a conscious \r\ndecision taken by South Sudan’s political leadership, \r\nas enshrined in the 2011 transitional Constitution, to \r\nbuild a broad-based democracy in the post-conflict \r\nsetting. We set up the 10 states with popularly elected \r\ngovernors and democratic legislatures as a nucleus of \r\ngood governance. In 2010, President Kiir Mayardit was \r\ndemocratically and overwhelmingly elected. Our noble \r\nstruggle was to actualize the ideals and values of true \r\ndemocracy, so cherished by our people.\r\nAccording to our Constitution, the next elections \r\nwill be held in 2015. Indeed, on 18 September, our \r\nPresident publicly confirmed the date. The governing \r\nparty, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) \r\nwill hold another general convention in March 2014 to \r\nfreely elect its structures in preparation for the 2015 \r\nnational general elections.\r\nLet me turn to the issue of women. Women have \r\nsuffered discrimination since 1956, with a literacy rate \r\nhardly reaching 18 per cent. The SPLM as a ruling party \r\nis now raising women’s political participation from the \r\n25 per cent in the current Constitution to a minimum \r\nof 35 per cent in the proposed permanent constitution.\r\nIn recent years, the National Legislative Assembly, \r\nof which I was twice elected Speaker and where I served \r\na total of eight years, enacted a good number of laws, \r\nincluding the Petroleum Revenue Management Act and \r\nthe Investment Act, among many others, setting out clear \r\nrules on how we can efficiently and prudently spend \r\nour oil revenues. With the support of our development \r\npartners in the region and internationally, we have now \r\nembarked on the development of our infrastructure. \r\nNumerous infrastructural projects are under way. \r\nIn response to the oil shutdown last year, the \r\nGovernment implemented austerity measures. We \r\nreduced Government spending by 40 per cent, and at \r\nthe moment we have considerably increased non-oil \r\nrevenue collection. We take seriously our responsibility \r\nto ensure that public funds are properly utilized and \r\nthat our spending is rigorously monitored. We are thus \r\ndetermined to uncompromisingly fight practices of \r\nmaladministration, including corruption.\r\nWe deeply regret the loss of the lives of the Indian \r\npeacekeepers, the Russian helicopter crew and the \r\ngeared towards ridding the region and indeed the globe \r\nof terrorism.\r\nI convey sincere my gratitude, as well as that \r\nof President Kiir Mayardit and the people of South \r\nSudan, to the United Nations, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil, the countries of the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development, the Troika, and all people \r\nof goodwill for diplomatically helping us to bring to \r\nan end to the conflict that had devastated our country \r\nfor decades. We are grateful in particular to the \r\ninternational community for closely monitoring the \r\ndifficult implementation of the peace accord. Given the \r\ncomplexity of the issues involved, the implementation \r\nof the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) has been \r\nrelatively successful, although the protocols of the two \r\nstates of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile, the case of \r\nthe contested area of Abyei, and the demarcation of the \r\nborders between South Sudan and the Sudan continue \r\nto impede the full implementation of the peace accord.\r\nOur country is well endowed with abundant \r\nnatural resources. Our relations with the Sudan \r\nhave recently involved unexpected tensions, with \r\nintermittent suspensions of oil f low through the Sudan. \r\nInside the South itself, old quarrels dating back to \r\ntime immemorial have re-emerged among certain \r\ncommunities over cattle-grazing and water points. \r\nThis became complicated during the last war as guns \r\nof various calibre fell into the hands of unauthorized \r\ncivilians. We are working hard as a Government to \r\nentrench peace in all corners of South Sudan. We have \r\nestablished programmes to rehabilitate and integrate \r\nformer rebel groups into our armed forces and society \r\nat large.\r\nWe have to build a country literally from scratch, \r\nwith non-existent physical and social infrastructure. \r\nThis has given us the worst human development \r\nindicators in the world, including high maternal and \r\ninfant mortality rates and high illiteracy rates among a \r\npopulation of over 8 million.\r\nWhile we recognize that, as humans and as a \r\nGovernment, we must have made errors of judgment as \r\nwe sought to fix a war-devastated country, successful \r\nsteps have also been taken, and we appeal for the \r\ngoodwill shown to us in those times of difficulty to \r\ncontinue. We are confronted with the test of adherence \r\nto human rights as a consequence of malicious action \r\nby external hands, rather than of our own making. We \r\ncommend any objective criticism and we call on the \r\nexperts on South Sudan also to appreciate the bigger \r\n13-48662 17/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nreceiving much-needed humanitarian assistance from \r\nUnited Nations agencies and other organizations. \r\nOut of the total population of approximately \r\n140,000 in Pibor, for instance, nearly 100,000 people \r\nhave been identified in the Pibor bush alone, along with \r\nanother 10,000 in Juba City and 26,000 registered as \r\nrefugees in neighbouring countries. We appeal from \r\nthis rostrum for expeditious relief assistance in various \r\nforms.\r\nAnother urgent security demand is the training of \r\na police force capable of eliminating the high rate of \r\ncrime we are experiencing in Pibor county and, indeed, \r\nthe entire country. UNMISS, to which we express our \r\nprofound appreciation, has helped transform hundreds \r\nof former combatants into a police force conscious of \r\nthe rule of law. UNMISS is doing a very commendable \r\njob under its able leadership. The rate of crime caused \r\nby the proliferation of small arms has been alarming. \r\nWhile our police force has managed to apprehend many \r\ncriminals, others are still at large. The Government \r\nis committed to erasing this menace. We refute any \r\nallegation to the effect that such violations are deliberate \r\nand systematic orchestrations.\r\nOur relationship with the Sudan has been a mixture \r\nof cooperation and squabbles. Fundamentally, both \r\nsides acknowledge that there is no alternative to lasting \r\npeace other than harmony and cooperation, given our \r\nshared history. That is why President Kiir Mayardit, \r\nremarkably, visited Khartoum early this month and  held \r\namicable discussions with his counterpart, President \r\nOmer Hassan Al-Bashir of the Sudan. They agreed to \r\nenhance cooperation on all fronts, including allowing \r\nthe unhindered f low of oil from South Sudan through \r\nthe Sudan.\r\nWe call on the parties at war in the Sudan to find \r\na durable political solution to the conflict, a situation \r\nto which the CPA has provided a workable remedy. We \r\nurge the international community to play a positive, \r\nstepped-up role in narrowing the gap between both \r\nparties. The civil war currently taking place in the Nuba \r\nmountains and Blue Nile regions of the Sudan, as well \r\nas in Darfur, has created an influx of refugees to South \r\nSudan, and that is a source of concern for us. We appeal \r\nfor humanitarian access and supplies for those refugees. \r\nGiven our unique knowledge, acquaintance and position \r\nas partners to Khartoum and former comrades-in-arms \r\nin the fighting forces in those two regions, in addition \r\nto our interest in realizing peace along our northern \r\nKenyan and South Sudanese relief workers in Pibor \r\ncounty. We express our condolences to the families and \r\nthe Governments of those who lost their lives. We wish \r\nto assure the international community that such tragic \r\nincidents will not be repeated.\r\nJonglei state, the most populous, with inaccessible \r\nterrain, has been of particular concern to us as a \r\nGovernment as well as to the international community. \r\nThere is no doubt about that. It has serious security and \r\ninfrastructural impediments. We regret the security \r\nimpediments in Jonglei and assure the international \r\ncommunity of our Government’s determination to \r\ntransform our army, the Sudan People’s Liberation \r\nArmy (SPLA), into a professional national army \r\nthat respects human rights and the rule of law and is \r\ncommitted to the protection of civilians. \r\nThe President has declared a general amnesty for \r\nthe rebel groups, and already two large groups, one \r\nunder General Bapin and the second under General \r\nJohnson Oluny, have responded positively. The \r\nPresident has also ordered the mandatory disarmament \r\nof the civilian population and has taken legal steps to \r\npunish the perpetrators of human rights violations in \r\nJonglei, including an SPLA Brigade Commander, who \r\nis now under arrest together with 13 soldiers who have \r\nbeen sentenced to prison terms that range from three to \r\nfive years. To date 84 cases of human rights abuses have \r\nbeen tried in the courts of law. We are determined to \r\nsee that the violations committed by some indisciplined \r\nSPLA elements do not go unpunished. \r\nRecently the Government formed a peace and \r\nreconciliation committee headed by top religious \r\nleaders to promote dialogue with all groups, including \r\nrebel groups in Pibor county.\r\nThe Government has allowed the United Nations \r\nMission in South Sudan (UNMISS), the Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) \r\nand other humanitarian bodies unhindered access to \r\nall parts of the country, including, of course, Jonglei \r\nstate. Regarding the situation in Pibor county, which \r\nhas been of particular concern to all of us, we have \r\ndetermined, thanks to UNMISS and OCHA, the \r\nnumber of people who are currently registered for food \r\ndistribution in various camps for internally displaced \r\npersons and villages. If that number is compared with \r\nthe pre-conflict population of Pibor county, we could \r\nnow be relatively relieved at the fact that most of those \r\nwho had been unaccounted for are in fact alive and \r\n18/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nend to human rights violations. It is important for the \r\nUnited Nations to monitor and promote the complete \r\nimplementation of the cooperation agreements reached \r\nbetween South Sudan and Sudan to cement harmonious \r\nand peaceful coexistence.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. James Wani Igga, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolas Tiangaye, Prime \r\nMinister, Head of Government, Minister of \r\nFinance and the Budget of the Central  \r\nAfrican Republic \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will \r\nnow hear an address by the Prime Minister, Head of \r\nGovernment, Minister of Finance and the Budget of the \r\nCentral African Republic.\r\nMr. Nicolas Tiangaye, Prime Minister, Head of \r\nGovernment, Minister of Finance and the Budget \r\nof the Central African Republic, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Nicolas Tiangaye, Prime \r\nMinister, Head of Government, Minister of Finance \r\nand the Budget of the Central African Republic, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Tiangaye (Central African Republic) (spoke \r\nin French): The theme chosen for the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly is “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage”. The attainment \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the \r\nCentral African Republic has been compromised as a \r\nresult of the crisis that we are going through. I shall \r\ntherefore devote my statement entirely to the situation \r\nthat prevails in my country.\r\nAs national leaders gather here in New York to share \r\ntheir concerns in a world where violence, hate, extreme \r\npoverty and armed conflict are ever more present and \r\na miserable generation lives in indescribable suffering, \r\nI have the onerous duty of taking the f loor as Prime \r\nMinister and Head of the Transitional Government \r\nof National Unity of the Central African Republic to \r\naddress, from this lofty rostrum at the United Nations, \r\nborder, the Government of South Sudan can play a \r\nconstructive mediation role if required.\r\nOn Abyei, we will continue to cooperate with the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan to implement the agreement on \r\nthe final status of Abyei through a referendum, set \r\nfor October 2013 by the African Union High-Level \r\nImplementation Panel. The African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council and the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil accepted the proposal as “representing a fair, \r\nequitable and workable solution”. The international \r\ncommunity must therefore ensure that this proposal is \r\nimplemented expeditiously.\r\nOur new Government in Juba, energetic and with \r\nnew faces, is leaner, so as to reduce expenditure, but \r\nbroader in terms of inclusiveness of other political parties \r\nand civil society, even those without party affiliation. \r\nThe reshuffle has been highly supported and applauded \r\ncountrywide, with a recent opinion poll carried out by \r\ntwo organizations — CRN and ST — showing 84.7 per \r\ncent for the new team and 92 per cent for the choice of \r\nthe new Vice-President. \r\nWhile many, including our friends, had doubted \r\nour ability to peacefully manage as simple a political \r\nexercise as a cabinet reshuffle, the domestic backing \r\nis revealing. Our immediate agenda for the new phase, \r\nwhich we are calling phase two, is to improve health \r\ncare, education, roads, electricity supply and the \r\nquality of life. We are determined to uproot impunity \r\nand corruption, phenomena which plague post-conflict \r\nStates, wherever they may be, and which can derail all \r\nof our efforts and determination to succeed. Based on \r\nits resolve to combat corruption and set a new standard, \r\nour Government has erased 16,000 “ghost names” \r\nit found on the police payroll. We are carrying out a \r\nsimilar exercise in the military and other organized \r\nforces.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to repeat that we remain \r\nsteadfast in our vision of a country at peace with itself \r\nand with its neighbours — a country which is growing \r\nin security, the rule of law and human rights and \r\nprogressing towards justice and prosperity. I offer my \r\nsincere thanks to our many partners and friends for their \r\ncontinued support. We look towards the future confident \r\nof what we, a people emerging from marginalization \r\nand suffering civil strife, can accomplish together.\r\nThe Organization has to redouble its efforts to \r\nnurture and reinforce its new Member, South Sudan, \r\nboth economically and in its determination to put an \r\n13-48662 19/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nof cyclical political and military crises, which have \r\nled to a succession of political regimes. The decades \r\nof recurrent crisis have created constant instability, \r\nwhich has led to the disintegration of the State. The \r\nhome-grown causes of this situation derive from the \r\nfragility of the State, a lack of political dialogue, a \r\nfailure to abide by commitments in the management of \r\npublic affairs, a refusal to let go of power, tribalism, \r\nnepotism and the politics of exclusion. In addition, \r\nthere are now phenomena previously unheard of in the \r\nCentral African Republic — impassioned inter-ethnic \r\nand interreligious tensions that remind us of the \r\ntragedies suffered by other African countries.\r\nThe external causes are due to the collateral effects \r\nof the crises in Darfur and Libya, as well as the long \r\nconflict in the Sudan, which led to the independence of \r\nSouth Sudan; the conflict in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo; the actions of residual groups of former \r\nChadian rebels; and the terrorist activities of Joseph \r\nKony’s LRA in the south-east of the country. The \r\nvarious disturbances have led to the circulation of \r\na large quantity of military weapons of all calibres \r\nthroughout our country. Those weapons have gravely \r\nimpaired the security and the humanitarian situation in \r\nthe Central African Republic and led to serious human \r\nrights violations; massacres of civilian populations; \r\nkidnappings; summary executions; mass rapes; \r\nlarge-scale pillaging and arson, including the burning \r\nof private houses, public buildings and grain silos; the \r\ndesecration of places of worship; and the degradation of \r\nnatural resources and wildlife.\r\nThe Central African Republic is thus faced \r\nwith multifaceted challenges that require immediate \r\naction to restore the security of people and property \r\nthroughout the territory. There must be protection of \r\nand humanitarian assistance to vulnerable sectors of the \r\npopulation, including internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees. State administration must be re-established \r\nthroughout our territory. We also need to restore social \r\ncohesion and national harmony. We must revive our \r\neconomy, manage public finances and organize general \r\nelections. In accordance with the commitments made \r\nto the Heads of State and Government of the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS), the \r\nGovernment plans to establish conditions for a return \r\nto security, peace and constitutional order by 2015.\r\nThe goal at the end of the period of peaceful \r\ntransition, which every citizen in the Central African \r\nRepublic longs for, is a country where peace and security \r\nthe human tragedy aff licting the people of my country, \r\nwhose suffering seems to have been forgotten by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nAt the outset, I and my delegation would like to \r\nconvey to Mr. John W. Ashe our heartfelt congratulations \r\non his election to serve as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. I also wish to \r\nacknowledge the remarkable work carried out under \r\nthe leadership of Mr. Vuk Jeremić, his predecessor. \r\nIn addition, I wish to express my utmost gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his energy and \r\npragmatism and, in particular, for the special attention \r\nthat he continually pays to my country and its people.\r\nI must also pay well-deserved tribute to the Heads \r\nof State of the Economic Community of West African \r\nStates and of the Central African Economic and \r\nMonetary Community, who unfailingly come to my \r\ncountry’s aid as it suffers from multiple crises, and to the \r\nUnited Nations, the European Union, the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie and France for their \r\nunflagging support to the Central African Republic \r\nin these very trying times. Our thanks go, too, to the \r\nUnited States Government, which has been fighting \r\nwith us side by side against the Lord’s Resistance Army \r\n(LRA) of Joseph Kony.\r\nThe terrible news of the terrorist attack in Nairobi \r\nreached us as we gathered here in New York. My \r\ncountry condemns that and other senseless attacks and \r\nexpresses its condolences to the aff licted families and \r\nto the Kenyan people.\r\nThe tragedy affecting the Syrian people for more \r\nthan two years demands action from the international \r\ncommunity. The use of chemical weapons against the \r\ncivilian population must be strongly condemned. That \r\nis why my country supports the actions under way to \r\ndismantle the chemical arsenal in Syria, with emphasis \r\non a diplomatic resolution of that crisis.\r\nWhile Africa has the dubious honour of \r\ndistinguishing itself by the acts of violence of all sorts \r\nthat occur there, the continent still gives us grounds \r\nfor hope. Only a few days ago, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita \r\nwas elected President of Mali, a country in the throes \r\nof a crisis that has undermined its national unity. We \r\nconvey to him our warmest congratulations and our \r\ninexhaustible encouragement in his efforts to restore \r\npeace and sow the seeds of democracy in his country.\r\nIn the half-century of its independence, the \r\nCentral African Republic has experienced a series \r\n20/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nformer President and wanted to regain power. Muslim \r\nfamilies were massacred, which led to extremely \r\ncruel reprisals by the former Séléka elements against \r\nChristian populations and innocent civilians.\r\nAccordingly, the Head of State, in agreement with \r\nthe Government of National Unity, took 10 measures \r\nto strengthen security: the appointment of a Minister \r\nof Security from civil society to head the Ministry \r\nof Public Security; the arrest and arraignment of \r\npersons suspected of crimes, violence and looting in \r\nthe areas of Bangui concerned and the sentencing of \r\n16 former Séléka members to eight years in prison, \r\nby which the Government demonstrated its resolve \r\nto combat impunity; the entrusting of all operations \r\nto the police and the gendarmerie alone; the placing \r\nof the gendarmerie and police under the Ministry \r\nof Public Security so that manpower and material \r\nresources could be shared to ensure effective security \r\nthroughout the territory; the dismantling of the former \r\nSéléka coalition and the Convention of Patriots for \r\nJustice and Peace; the removal of Séléka elements \r\nfrom police stations, private houses and administrative \r\nbuildings to restore security throughout the territory; \r\nthe resumption of police service in areas long occupied \r\nby former Séléka elements as a corollary to the release \r\nof persons arrested by them; the launch of operations \r\nto disarm former Séléka elements who refused to be \r\nquartered in the barracks assigned to them; the transfer \r\nof approximately 1,200 former Séléka members to two \r\nsites in the provinces of Sibut and Bossembélé, pending \r\nthe disarmament, demobilization and reintegration \r\nprogramme; and the initiation by the Head of State of a \r\nsocial dialogue through meetings with various sectors \r\nof the population, notably victims of former Séléka \r\nelements.\r\nThe 5 August 2013 report of the Secretary-General \r\n(S/2013/470) on the situation in the Central African \r\nRepublic paints a very dark and chaotic picture of the \r\nhumanitarian and security situation that reveals the \r\nreality of the daily lives of the Central African people. \r\nMoreover, since early August, armed confrontations in \r\nthe north-west have led to a considerably deteriorated \r\nhumanitarian situation in that region, where clashes \r\nhave occurred between former Séléka elements and \r\nself-defence groups and groups that support the \r\nformer President. It is important to note that at present \r\nthe humanitarian situation is utterly catastrophic. \r\nApproximately 4.6 million Central Africans are \r\naffected by the crisis, that is, every single person in our \r\ncountry. There are approximately 1.6 million internally \r\nare guaranteed in all sectors of political, economic and \r\nsocial life, where disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration are successfully managed and where free, \r\ntransparent and credible elections are held, thereby \r\nensuring the designation of legitimate authorities in the \r\ncontry.\r\nIn compliance with the commitments made in the \r\n11 January 2013 Libreville Agreement and the 18 April \r\n2013 N’Djamena Declaration, under the auspices of \r\nthe Heads of State of ECCAS, we have established \r\ntransitional institutions, including the Government \r\nof National Unity, in which due regard is paid to \r\ngeographical and political balance; and the National \r\nTransitional Council, a legislative and constituent \r\ntransitional body. We have adopted a constitutional \r\ntransitional charter and an organization act relating \r\nto the transitional constitutional court. We have also \r\nappointed and sworn in the members of the court, and \r\nthe Head of State of the transition has now taken his \r\noath of office. The last institution, namely, the high \r\ncommunications council, will soon be established. \r\nThe next elections will be organized by our national \r\nauthority for elections, which will be established in the \r\ndays to come.\r\nWe are trying to re-establish our defence forces \r\nwith help from the international community, but that \r\nwill be possible only if some basic conditions are met. \r\nThe Head of State and the Government of National \r\nUnity are tackling that extremely difficult task.\r\nFollowing the violence, killings and looting in the \r\nBoyrabe and Boeing neighbourhoods in the city of \r\nBangui, measures have been taken to ban former Séléka \r\nelements from maintaining order. Now the mission rests \r\nsolely with the gendarmerie and the police. A ceremony \r\nof reconciliation took place between the officers of \r\nthe Central African Armed Forces and those of the \r\nformer Séléka rebellion. The Séléka coalition has been \r\ndissolved, and we are trying to create a dynamic fusion \r\nof the latter with the Central African Armed Forces.\r\nWith regard to the encampment of the former \r\nSéléka coalition, 15 sites have been established in the \r\nprovinces in order to bring together the former Séléka \r\nrebels for identification and disarmament and to select \r\nthose who could possibly join the army. While efforts \r\nwere under way to do that, new outbreaks of violence \r\nerupted in certain prefectures of the Central African \r\nRepublic, at Bossangoa and Bouca, involving armed \r\nclashes between former Séléka elements and organized \r\nself-defence groups, who claimed to be supporters of the \r\n13-48662 21/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nand robust mandate from the Security Council in order \r\nto provide security, bring peace to the country and \r\nprotect civilians. It is also the duty of the international \r\ncommunity, however, to provide the financial, material \r\nand logistic resources needed to meet the many \r\nchallenges that my country is facing. The challenges \r\nare self-evident and enormous. Apart from providing \r\nsecurity in the country, organizing elections, restoring \r\nthe administration, providing judicial, economic and \r\nsocial reform are all part of the road map that was \r\ndrawn up in Libreville.\r\nThose imperatives are especially topical right \r\nnow as the rainy season is approaching and our \r\npeople are in a state of total destitution. The already \r\ncritical humanitarian situation is worsening, as \r\ndemonstrated by the vast number of internally displaced \r\npersons — between 1.5 million and 1.6 million. The \r\nproliferation of arms in Bangui and the deterioration of \r\nthe humanitarian situation and social atmosphere are \r\nlikely to jeopardize the success of the transition. Given \r\nthat avalanche of problems, the Government of National \r\nUnity has to set security, humanitarian, budgetary and \r\npolicy priorities.\r\nIf we are to be successful in stabilizing the \r\ncountry and bringing peace, we have to reinvent a \r\nnew programme of disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration and we have to rethink how to reform \r\nthe security sector, for security is the keystone of the \r\ntransition and the need for innovative approaches is \r\ngreater now than ever before. We will not be able to meet \r\nthose challenges unless we get four kinds of assistance: \r\nfinancial, technical, material and humanitarian. \r\nOur partners need to be supportive of our transition, \r\nprovide urgent budgetary support and help us with their \r\nexpertise.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly offers \r\nme once again an opportunity to beg the international \r\ninstitutions to commit to providing strong support and \r\nhigh-quality expertise in a coordinated, complementary, \r\ncoherent and transparent way. A failure to carry out the \r\ntransition will make our country impossible to govern, \r\nwhich would inevitably lead to a gray area at the heart \r\nof the African continent. \r\nThere are already several foreign armed groups in \r\nour country. The Lord’s Resistance Army, which has \r\nbeen present in the south-east of the country since \r\n2008, has killed several hundreds people, raped dozens \r\nof women, abducted thousands of children and burned \r\nentire villages. The Vakaga region has been penetrated \r\ndisplaced persons who are in dire need of assistance, \r\nand approximately 60,000 children are at risk of \r\ndying of malnutrition.Approximately 62,000 people \r\nsought refuge in neighbouring countries, including \r\nand principally 40,500 in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. At least 650,000 children are unable \r\nto go to school. More than 484,000, or 10.6 per cent \r\nof our population, are facing a very serious situation \r\nof food insecurity. Around 3,500 children have been \r\nrecruited by armed groups. More than 13,700 people \r\non antiretroviral medications are at risk of not being \r\nable to follow their treatments because of possible \r\ninterruption of the supply chain. Less than 20 per cent \r\nof the country’s health-care facilities are working. That \r\nis the humanitarian situation caused by insecurity.\r\nGiven that backdrop, the international community \r\nhas now undertaken to rush to the assistance of the \r\nCentral African Republic. Accordingly, 3,652 military \r\nand civilian personnel will make up the African-led \r\nInternational Support Mission in the Central African \r\nRepublic. It will take over from the Mission for the \r\nConsolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic, \r\nwhich has been in the country for several years under \r\ndifferent designations. \r\nOn behalf of my country, I would like to extend \r\nmy appreciation and thanks to Cameroon, the Congo, \r\nGabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nChad, which, for the time being, are the only countries \r\ncontributing troops to the force. It is our hope that \r\nother African countries will follow their example; \r\nI understand that Burundi is getting ready to send a \r\nbattalion with 450 troops.\r\nI hope to see the international community step up \r\nits efforts and continue to be supportive of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic as it seeks lasting peace. In that \r\nrespect, I would note the urgent appeal issued by many \r\nStates for the greater involvement of the United Nations \r\nin resolving the crisis in the Central African Republic. \r\nKeeping in mind that the Central African Republic is \r\na crumbling State, that appeal is for us a request for \r\nassistance for a people who are at risk and for a gesture \r\nof strong solidarity. It is therefore a matter of urgency \r\nthat the International Support Mission should become \r\noperational quickly under the auspices of the African \r\nUnion, taking over from the former Multinational \r\nForce of the Central African Economic and Monetary \r\nCommunity.\r\nGiven the degree of the violence and the extent of \r\ndevastation, the new multinational force needs a clear \r\n22/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nresonates like a last request to our universal conscience. \r\nA human tragedy that calls for urgent action is playing \r\nout before our eyes. Every day that passes brings its \r\nshare of bloodshed, women raped, children kidnapped \r\nand millions displaced or exiled.\r\nNow more than ever, therefore, action is needed \r\nfor my country’s civilian population. If nothing is \r\ndone now, tomorrow will be too late. And in the face \r\nof history, the international community can no longer \r\nabjure its political and moral responsibilities.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Head of \r\nGovernment, Minister of Finance and the Budget of the \r\nCentral African Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Nicolas Tiangaye, Prime Minister, Head of \r\nGovernment, Minister of Finance and the Budget \r\nof the Central African Republic, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Iurie Leancă, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova.\r\nMr. Iurie Leancă, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Iurie Leancă, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Moldova, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Leancă (Republic of Moldova): I would \r\nfirst like to congratulate Mr. John Ashe of Antigua \r\nand Barbuda on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to \r\nwish him every success in his post. I am confident that \r\nhis diligence and perspicacity will contribute to our \r\nefforts to address the challenges of today’s world. I \r\nwould also like to express my appreciation for the work \r\nof Mr. Vuk Jeremić in presiding over the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh session and my best wishes for his \r\nfurther success in his career. And I pay tribute to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless \r\nwork promoting peace and security, human rights and \r\nprosperity in a sustainable global environment, as \r\nwell as for his efforts to make this Organization more \r\ntransparent and efficient.\r\nby traffickers and poachers from neighbouring \r\ncountries, including the Sudan. If the Central African \r\nState collapses, new criminal and terrorist networks \r\ncould settle in the country and destabilize the entire \r\nregion. While stability in Central Africa is a major \r\nconcern of the international community, that concern \r\nmust go beyond the minimal reactions and half-hearted \r\ncommitments that are too often features of international \r\nsupport for political transition.\r\nI recall that Ms. Valerie Amos, Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency \r\nRelief Coordinator, and Ms. Kristalina Georgieva, \r\nEuropean Commissioner for International Cooperation, \r\nHumanitarian Aid and Crisis Response, came to \r\nmy country in July 2013 and visited the devastated \r\npopulation of the city of Kaga Bandoro. When they \r\nreturned to Bangui, they told me about the heart-\r\nrending scenes they had witnessed. They had met a \r\nwoman who had lost all hope and who asked why the \r\nworld had abandoned her country. This survivor cried \r\nout in distress, saying, “Do not abandon us.” And her \r\nvoice is that of millions of others in the Central African \r\nRepublic who are calling for help. \r\nThe crisis in my country may be a national crisis, \r\nbut the solution, in its four dimensions — military, \r\nsecurity, humanitarian and financial — has to be \r\ninternational. There is no short-term alternative to the \r\nfull involvement of the international community to \r\nsave the Central African Republic. On 19 September in \r\nBamako, French President François Hollande said that \r\n“when the law is trampled upon, when women \r\nand children are being massacred, it is then that \r\nthe international community must rise up and \r\ndemonstrate solidarity”. \r\nThe time has come for the international community to \r\nrise up and save the Central African Republic. It did so \r\nfor Mali; there is no reason why it should not do so for \r\nmy country. \r\nThe Central African people do not understand this \r\nkind of international solidarity, with one rule for one \r\ncountry and another rule for another. Now more than \r\never, action is needed to help a people in danger. Now \r\nmore than ever, every means that has already been \r\nused elsewhere must be mobilized to avert irreparable \r\nharm. The cry of distress from that poor woman from \r\nKaga Bandoro addressed to Ms. Valerie Amos and \r\nMs. Kristalina Georgieva is the same cry of 4.6 million \r\nCentral Africans to the international community, and it \r\n13-48662 23/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nresults-oriented projects as well as investments in \r\nessential areas.\r\nI would also like to touch on the problems of \r\nmigration and population movement. The United \r\nNations has acknowledged more than once that \r\nmigration can benefit the development of countries of \r\norigin as much as that of countries of destination, if \r\ninternational cooperation is strengthened and suitable \r\npolicies are put in place. That is certainly the case \r\nwith the Republic of Moldova, where migration has \r\ncontributed to our macroeconomic stability in recent \r\nyears. \r\nAt the same time, we are living through a period \r\nof considerable change that is likely to influence the \r\ndemographic, economic, social and security aspects \r\nof our population. There is no doubt that investing \r\nin human capital is fundamentally a way out of \r\ndemographic volatility and an indispensable condition \r\nfor our country’s prosperity, while ensuring respect \r\nfor human rights. That is how we aim to reduce the \r\ninterdependence between development and migration \r\nf lows and to create an environment conducive to \r\ncommunity development, including small and medium-\r\nsize businesses, with financial aid awarded directly \r\nfrom the State budget.\r\nHowever, I would also like to draw the attention \r\nof the Assembly to the positive examples derived from \r\nthe mobility partnership between the Republic of \r\nMoldova and the European Union. That initiative has \r\nstrengthened the Government’s capacity to formulate \r\nand implement migration policies, find shared priorities \r\nwith the EU and develop innovative and strategic \r\nlegislative initiatives, based on best practices. We must \r\ndefinitely continue in that spirit, which is the only way \r\nto arrive at mutually acceptable solutions for regular \r\nand circulating migration that can benefit our citizens, \r\nwhile ensuring that human rights are protected and \r\nsocial security guaranteed.\r\nI would like to mention here one of the most \r\nsignificant achievements of the Assembly, the adoption \r\nof the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which was made \r\npossible after several years of intense debate and \r\nnegotiation on the regulation of the world’s arms trade.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has signed the ATT, and \r\nwe hope that the rapid entry into force of the Treaty \r\nwill make the global arms trade more transparent and \r\nlegitimate. The ATT could be a great step forward \r\nin controlling the proliferation and illicit circulation \r\nBefore the key points of my statement, I would like \r\nto offer my condolences to the victims of the senseless \r\nattack in Kenya.\r\nThe United Nations is in the midst of establishing \r\na new post-2015 development agenda that will continue \r\nand advance the ambitious commitments laid down \r\nin the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). We \r\nwelcome the inauguration earlier this week of the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development as a \r\nkey step towards the implementation of the outcome \r\ndocument of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex). \r\nWe expect that the high-level dialogue will reinforce \r\nand launch the implementation of the three pillars \r\nof sustainable development — economic prosperity, \r\nsocial equity and environmental protection — with \r\nthe firm commitment of Member States to deliver \r\non those priority areas. We recall the huge effort it \r\ntook for this Organization to agree last year in Rio \r\non the wide-ranging framework for a world working \r\ncooperatively towards a sustainable future, and we are \r\nhopeful that this effort will yield results sooner rather \r\nthan later.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFor the Republic of Moldova, sustainable \r\ndevelopment is the only way to ensure a decent life \r\nfor our people. It follows that we must foster economic \r\ndevelopment and solve our energy security problems \r\nwhile ensuring an ecologically healthy environment. \r\nMy Government has been working hard to achieve \r\nthose ends, together with its relevant international \r\npartners, particularly the European Union (EU), \r\nwhich gives us a reference point for our national \r\npolicies. We are convinced that political will, mutual \r\nassistance and transparency in every significant issue \r\ncan bring just as much positive change to emerging and \r\ndeveloping economies as to poor ones. We reaffirm that \r\nissues such as poverty eradication, human rights and \r\ntolerance, access to quality education without gender \r\ndiscrimination, decent jobs for all and the preservation \r\nof nature and biodiversity should have special priority \r\non the United Nations development agenda in the years \r\nto come.\r\nCooperation between sectors is also a key issue, \r\nwhich is why international partners and the donor \r\ncommunity, including the private sector and civil \r\nsociety, should work hand in hand with the United \r\nNations and Governments in order to mobilize the \r\nnecessary resources and use them to target specific \r\n24/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nIn that connection, we are proud to announce that \r\nthe Government has embarked on a new course of \r\ntechnological modernization to enable direct public \r\naccess to Government services. Our aim is to make all \r\nsuch Government services electronically available to \r\nall citizens by 2020 at any time, from anywhere, using \r\nmodern communication technologies and devices such \r\nas computers, mobile phones and interactive payment \r\noffices. Such a system will combat corruption, reduce \r\nunnecessary bureaucracy and ensure true transparency \r\nin the relationship between citizens and public officials. \r\nThe Republic of Moldova is among the leaders in \r\nthat field, and our efforts have already yielded real \r\nbenefits for our citizens with the implementation of our \r\nelectronic catalogue for public services, mobile digital \r\nsignatures, the Government’s electronic payment portal \r\nand many more services.\r\nThe ambitious reform agenda of the Government and \r\nits foreign policy are both directed towards the fulfilment \r\nof our country’s strategic objective — European \r\nintegration. At this stage, we have concluded the \r\nnegotiations on the Association Agreement with the EU \r\nand its component part, the Deep and Comprehensive \r\nFree Trade Area Agreement, and the initialling of the \r\ntexts is going to take place at the upcoming Eastern \r\nPartnership summit to be held in Vilnius in November. \r\nAll of those actions — the political association with the \r\nEU, the economic rapprochement and the perspective \r\nof visa-free travel for our citizens — are bringing us \r\ncloser to our final goal, namely EU integration, and \r\nthey open new perspectives for political and economic \r\ncooperation in the region.\r\nEvery year, my delegation brings to the attention \r\nof the Assembly the issue of the protracted conflict \r\nin the Transnistrian region, which has affected my \r\ncountry ever since independence. As a nation that \r\nvalues national consolidation and unity, that conflict is \r\na constant challenge that undermines our development \r\nefforts. The political settlement of the conflict and the \r\nreintegration of the country are our strategic priority. \r\nWe envisage uniting the population from both banks of \r\nthe Dniester River around shared goals and providing \r\nthem with a better future. It also means removing one \r\nof the most fundamental challenges to our national \r\nsecurity, economic development and social cohesion. \r\nUltimately, resolving the Transnistrian conflict means \r\nguaranteeing secured national borders and opening a \r\nnew perspective towards stability and fruitful, bilateral \r\nand equitable relations with our neighbours and \r\ninternational partners.\r\nof weapons, especially in vulnerable areas and in \r\nareas that do not respect the constitutional system of \r\nsovereign States.\r\nIn addition, the Government is working closely with \r\nits European and international partners, in particular \r\nwith Germany’s Federal Office of Economics and \r\nExport Control and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe, to review and amend national \r\nlegislation on the export control of dual-use goods in \r\norder to adopt the best international standards and rely \r\non the best international experience in that field.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, my \r\ncountry has completed the first cycle of the universal \r\nperiodic review, which is, in our opinion, one of the \r\nbest exercises for monitoring and evaluating the \r\nresults of national human rights institutions and \r\nmechanisms. At the same time, we agreed to undertake \r\nnew commitments to meet the challenges involved in \r\nimplementing the recommendations of the universal \r\nperiodic review.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova continues to advocate for \r\na review of the human rights situation by all countries \r\nand States and believes that a robust, apolitical and \r\nimpartial Human Rights Council should exercise \r\ngreater authority, especially in cases of serious human \r\nrights violations, and should provide guidance on the \r\nimplementation of the best practices and standards in \r\nthis area.\r\nMy Government is pleased to announce the fourth \r\nseminar of Francophone countries, to be held at the \r\nbeginning of 2014, in Chisinau, our capital, to discuss \r\nthe results of and lessons learned from the first cycle of \r\nthe universal periodic review. We hope that the findings \r\nof that seminar will contribute to the advancement, \r\nstrengthening and improvement of the universal \r\nperiodic review as a unique mechanism for the review \r\nof human rights practices in all States members of the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is pursuing an intensive \r\nand comprehensive reform programme in the political, \r\neconomic, institutional, legislative, demographic and \r\njudicial areas and others. We are firmly committed \r\nto building a State based on the rule of law, good \r\ngovernance, transparency and accountability. Through \r\nthose difficult efforts, we are becoming a stronger \r\nnation and a better international partner, and we must \r\nkeep pushing ahead.\r\n13-48662 25/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nexpert on human rights in the Transnistrian region of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, \r\noffers a good road map for joint activities in that regard. \r\nIn addition, I would like to reiterate our long-standing \r\nand unwavering call to finalize the withdrawal of the \r\nRussian military forces and ammunition from the \r\nterritory of the Republic of Moldova in accordance with \r\nthe relevant international commitments.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my \r\nGovernment’s conviction that the future of the region \r\nwill be brighter if we unite our efforts in building a \r\nstronger and unified country, open to Europe where \r\nit naturally belongs, and to diversity, tolerance and \r\neconomic and market opportunities. We are optimistic \r\nthat we can achieve that because there is no better \r\nvision that we could embrace for the well-being of our \r\npeople and the consolidation of our nation. \r\nThe Republic of Moldova places peace and real, \r\nconstructive dialogue above any political goal or \r\nambition. We follow with great concern the continuing \r\nviolence in the Middle East and abhor the loss of so \r\nmany lives and futures, which will perhaps irremediably \r\nmaim the consciousness of a whole generation, not \r\nonly in the conflict zones but worldwide. The refugee \r\ncrisis in Syria magnifies the perils of war, Hundreds \r\nof thousands of people have been displaced as they \r\ntry to salvage their lives and find peace. My own \r\ncountry has offered protection to a number of Syrian \r\nrefugees, and we recognize the significant burden that \r\nSyria’s neighbours and other receiving countries, many \r\nin Europe, face as they seek to alleviate the Syrian \r\nrefugees’ suffering, offer them a better chance for \r\nsurvival and affirm their basic human rights. It is time \r\nfor all sides to take a step back, find a peaceful solution \r\nand build a future for their people rather than pursue \r\nf leeting, treacherous and, so often, deadly political \r\ngoals.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express the hope that \r\nduring the current session the members of the Assembly \r\nwill succeed in reaching important decisions on topical \r\nissues, such as sustainable development, peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and many others. My delegation \r\nis willing and open to making its contribution in a \r\ncollaborative and constructive way. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova for the statement he has just made.\r\nPeace and dialogue are fundamental prerequisites \r\nfor a political solution to any conflict. Let me emphasize \r\nthat there have now been more than two decades of \r\npeace in the region, and we will spare no effort to \r\npreserve that peace. Moldova is fully committed to \r\ndialogue through all available channels. But in order to \r\nachieve the desired outcome, we desperately need trust \r\nwithin the resolution process and genuine engagement \r\nand commitment from the outside. We advocate for the \r\ncontinuation of the confidence-building activities that \r\nhave been taking place since 2007 with the support of \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme and the \r\nEuropean Union, aimed at bridging the gaps between \r\nall stakeholders from both banks and involving local \r\nauthorities, business communities and civil society.\r\nThe vision of the Government of the Republic \r\nof Moldova for a final solution to the conflict is \r\nunambiguous and inclusive. First, a comprehensive \r\nand viable solution must be based on respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the country. We \r\nare open to a reasonable compromise on a special status \r\nfor the region within the Republic of Moldova, which \r\nwould provide the population from the left bank with \r\na comfortable and guaranteed level of self-governance \r\nin various areas of public life. There should be a single \r\nconstitutional, economic and defence space within \r\nthe internationally recognized borders of Moldova. \r\nAt the same time, the Republic of Moldova should \r\nremain a functional State that continues to advance on \r\nits European path and makes every effort to allow the \r\npopulation and the business communities from both \r\nbanks to benefit equally from our extensive partnership \r\nwith the European Union and, hopefully, within the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nOn the conflict resolution matter, we will continue \r\nwith renewed impetus to seek solutions in order to ensure \r\nthe freedom of movement, improved transportation \r\nlinks and new and real opportunities for businesses on \r\nboth banks of the Dniester. We will also redouble our \r\nefforts to convince our partners to start talks on political \r\nand security issues, including the future status of the \r\nregion within the recognized borders of the Republic \r\nof Moldova. Moreover, we will seek to intensify law-\r\nenforcement interaction and preserve stability in the \r\nsecurity zone, and we reaffirm our stance on the need \r\nto transform the current peacekeeping mechanism into \r\nan international civilian mission.\r\nStrengthening respect for human rights is of utmost \r\nimportance to us. The report of the United Nations senior \r\n26/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nis clear that not much progress has been made in many \r\ncountries in achieving the Goals. Alive to that fact, \r\nthe United Nations is engaged in various processes in \r\npreparation for the post-2015 development era. It is in \r\nthis context that we welcome the theme for this session, \r\n“The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. \r\nOne of the key outcomes of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) was \r\nthat we launched a process to develop a set of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals (SDGs), which would build upon the \r\nMDGs and converge with the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. We note the progress that has been made in that \r\nregard and hope that the letter and spirit of the Rio+20 \r\noutcome document, “The future we want” (resolution \r\n66/288, annex), will be upheld. It is our hope that we \r\nwill develop SDGs that are simple to implement, while \r\nalso paying attention to the reality that no one size fits \r\nall.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda must be an \r\nintegral framework that will build upon the successes \r\nand failures of the MDGs. We need to reflect on the \r\nexperiences and lessons learned in implementing the \r\nMDGs, the results achieved and opportunities missed. \r\nIt is time for this body to come together and exercise its \r\ncollective responsibility to finalize this one shared goal \r\nof articulating and shaping a development agenda that \r\nis inclusive and people-centred. A new development \r\nagenda, premised upon the sovereign equality of all \r\nStates while recognizing their interdependence and \r\nmutually reinforcing roles, should be our goal. To \r\nachieve that, a renewed spirit of solidarity, cooperation \r\nand mutual accountability must underpin our efforts.\r\nIt is equally important, in our view, to pay special \r\nattention to the perils of climate change for our physical \r\nworld, as well as its destruction of ecosystems, all of \r\nwhich result in land degradation and contribute to the \r\ndecline of agricultural productivity. Agriculture is the \r\nmainstay of our small economies. In order to address \r\nthat challenge, agriculture and food security have to \r\nbe given the necessary prominence in the envisaged \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nSimilarly, sustainable mountain development \r\nshould be our ideal. To a country such as Lesotho, with \r\nover 60 per cent of its land area covered by mountains, \r\nsustainable mountain development is imperative for the \r\npeople to survive. Mountains are valuable water sources \r\nwith rich biodiversity. As such, international support \r\nfor conservation programmes and the protection of \r\nMr. Iurie Leancă, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, \r\nPrime Minister and Head of Government, \r\nMinister of Defence, Police and National \r\nSecurity of the Kingdom of Lesotho\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Head of \r\nGovernment, Minister of Defence, Police and National \r\nSecurity of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime Minister \r\nand Head of Government, Minister of Defence, \r\nPolice and National Security of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Thomas Motsoahae \r\nThabane, Prime Minister and Head of Government, \r\nMinister of Defence, Police and National Security of \r\nthe Kingdom of Lesotho, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Thabane (Lesotho): At the very outset, allow \r\nme to congratulate Mr. Ashe on his well-deserved \r\nelection to the office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. I assure him of my delegation’s full support \r\nand cooperation during his tenure of office. I also \r\nwish to commend his predecessor for the exemplary \r\nleadership he demonstrated during the previous session. \r\nFrom the humble beginnings of a f ledging \r\norganization more than six decades ago to a massive \r\nexpansion in membership today, the United Nations \r\nhas undoubtedly stood the test of time. Its worth as an \r\nindispensable entity in shaping the world of our time is \r\na matter of common cause. Some of the great strides the \r\nUnited Nations has made span the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, restoring calm in many countries through \r\npeacekeeping, raising awareness of human rights and \r\neradicating diseases. Nevertheless, much still needs to \r\nbe done.\r\nMuch of the world remains mired in poverty and \r\ndisease, while peace, security and stability continue to \r\nbe fragile. Economic development continues to be the \r\ngreatest challenge in our history. As we ushered in a new \r\nmillennium 13 years ago, we adopted the Millennium \r\nDeclaration and the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in order to focus the world’s attention on ending \r\nextreme poverty in all its forms. The 2015 deadline for \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs is fast approaching, yet it \r\n13-48662 27/28\r\n26/09/2013 A/68/PV.13\r\nA decade has passed since the initiation of \r\nthe notion of the responsibility to protect. Yet, the \r\noperationalization of that concept has not become a \r\nreality. The fact that crimes of mass atrocity continue \r\nto be committed around the world is a stark reminder \r\nthat the time for a collective approach to protecting \r\npopulations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity is now. Most \r\nmass atrocities often do not occur spontaneously, but \r\nrather as part of a planned process. Over the years, we \r\nhave learned the important lesson that the Organization \r\ncannot stand on the sidelines when challenged to take \r\npreventive action. In so doing, we should guard against \r\nthe misuse and abuse of the norm of the responsibility \r\nto protect by infringing on the national sovereignty or \r\naltering the legal obligation of Member States to refrain \r\nfrom the use of force except in conformity with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nFrom the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel \r\nregion to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nAfrican continent is facing a rise in lawlessness and \r\nconflicts. As we celebrate the jubilee of the formation \r\nof our continental organization, the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity, we are resolved, as leaders of Africa, \r\nthat Africa must open a new chapter going forward and \r\nextricate itself from the conflicts that have so soiled its \r\nreputation and compromised its development. We are \r\ndetermined to build a safe, secure and peaceful Africa \r\nfrom here forward.\r\nWith the presence of extremist groups and \r\nterrorist entities in the Middle East and elsewhere, \r\nterrorism continues to pose a serious threat to world \r\npeace, security and development. The ugly face of \r\nthat scourge has once again resurfaced in Kenya. We \r\ncondemn the barbaric killings of innocent people in the \r\nWestgate mall in Nairobi, committed by Al-Shabaab. \r\nOur thoughts and prayers are with the families that \r\nhave lost their loved ones. We all know that solutions \r\nto these problems cannot be through military means \r\nalone. We have to invest more in creating a holistic and \r\nintegrated approach that targets, among other things, the \r\nimprovement of economic development, the promotion \r\nof the rule of law, the protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, and good governance.\r\nIn the face of the numerous global challenges \r\nexisting in the world today, promoting more effective \r\nglobal governance should be at the forefront of the \r\ninternational agenda. We, the membership of the United \r\nNations, should strive for an international Organization \r\nmountain ecosystems should be at the forefront of our \r\nplans.\r\nThe state of peace and security in the world is \r\ngradually getting worse. The possession of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction \r\nremains the principal threat to the survival of \r\nhumankind. The widespread sectarian strife in the \r\nMiddle East and elsewhere and xenophobia are some \r\nof the great challenges to global peace. Sadly, discord \r\nremains among Member States on how to overcome \r\nthose problems.\r\nOf particular concern to my delegation is the \r\nsituation in Syria, which poses a serious and growing \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Scores of \r\ncivilians continue to be the principal victims. Women, \r\nchildren and the elderly are bearing the brunt of the \r\nconflict. The use of chemical weapons in Syria is not \r\nonly abhorrent, but also a crime against humanity. We \r\ncondemn it in the strongest terms, as it threatens to \r\nundermine the norm against the use of chemical weapons \r\nuniversally embraced by the international community. \r\nWe welcome the partial report of the United Nations \r\nchemical weapons inspectors investigating the use of \r\nthose weapons in Syria, and hope that the culprits will \r\nface the might of international law and justice.\r\nThe crisis in Syria has the potential to engulf the \r\nwhole Middle East region, with global ramifications. \r\nWe call on the international community to find a quick \r\nand lasting solution to the conflict. Whether in Syria or \r\nanywhere else, perpetrators of crimes against humanity \r\nmust be held legally accountable for their actions.\r\nHistory has revealed that human societies can \r\nenjoy peaceful, orderly progress only if the rule of \r\nlaw obtains. The conviction that peace and justice \r\nare inextricably intertwined has always underpinned \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations in the area of the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. \r\nIndeed, the International Criminal Court (ICC), created \r\nin 1998, is a beacon that speaks to that truism. We must \r\nuse institutions, such as the ICC and other international \r\nlegal tribunals, as a reflection of the international \r\ncommunity’s increasing rejection of impunity and \r\nevidence that there is a rising tide in favour of the \r\nrule of law. At the same time, we need to ensure that \r\ninstitutions, such as the ICC, are adequately insulated \r\nagainst politicization. Selective prosecutions must be \r\navoided.\r\n28/28 13-48662\r\nA/68/PV.13 26/09/2013\r\nmirror reflecting a divided and troubled world. Rather, \r\nthey yearn for progress and solutions to the problems \r\nbesieging their world. They want ideas, leadership and \r\nconcrete hope for the future. Our actions and decisions \r\nshould embody themes of peace and development that \r\nlook far beyond the immediacy of the moment. The \r\nchallenges that confront us today must be, more than \r\never before, addressed with the candour and decision \r\nthat the present global economic and political situation \r\ndictates to us all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nHead of Government, Minister of Defence, Police and \r\nNational Security of the Kingdom of Lesotho for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime Minister \r\nand Head of Government, Minister of Defence, \r\nPolice and National Security of the Kingdom of \r\nLesotho, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\nwith improved efficiency and effectiveness. In our \r\nefforts to reform the United Nations, emphasis needs to \r\nbe placed on enhancing, inter alia, its accountability and \r\nthat of all its organs and bodies and the programmes of \r\nMember States, irrespective of their size and influence.\r\nIt would be remiss of me not to express solidarity \r\nwith the people of Cuba for having endured sanctions for \r\nso many years. We also want to express our unwavering \r\nsolidarity with the people of Western Sahara, who have \r\nlanguished under the yoke of colonialism for far too \r\nlong. In the same vein, we express our unwavering \r\nsupport for the people of Palestine. As a small country \r\nthat was surrounded by apartheid South Africa for \r\nalmost a century, we understand the pain that others \r\nwho still languish under that kind of situation feel. \r\nThose situations are a challenge that this body can \r\neasily remove from our agenda simply by doing what is \r\nright. In true brotherly solidarity, we appeal to this body \r\nto remove those final vestiges of colonial oppression.\r\nIn conclusion, I need not emphasize that our \r\npeoples do not necessarily look at this Organization as a \r\n"
