"The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania.\r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kikwete: Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your well-\r\ndeserved election to steer the affairs of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. As I congratulate \r\nyou, I would like to assure you of Tanzania’s support and \r\ncooperation as you discharge of your responsibilities. \r\nI also wish to acknowledge and commend your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his \r\noutstanding leadership during the sixty-seventh session. \r\nA great deal was achieved because of his visionary and \r\nwise leadership. In the same vein, I would like to pay \r\nglowing tribute to our the Secretary-General for the \r\nexcellent work he is doing for the United Nations and \r\nhumankind at large.\r\nMy delegation and I find the theme of this year’s \r\nGeneral Assembly to be timely and very opportune. \r\nWe should start now to set the stage for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Hence I find the theme, “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, to be a \r\nwise choice: it affords us an opportunity to know where \r\nwe are with regard to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and to decide what needs to be done \r\nto complete the unfinished business and enable us to \r\nmake informed decisions beyond 2015.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals framework \r\nis the best development framework ever produced to \r\naddress global and national development challenges. \r\nThe world has never witnessed such a coalescence of \r\nconcerted efforts into a unified framework. It is heart-\r\nwarming to note that progress towards attaining MDGs \r\nhas been made over the past 13 years. However, that \r\nprogress varies from one Goal to another, and is highly \r\nuneven across nations and continents.\r\nAlthough extreme poverty has been halved at \r\nthe global level, more than 1.2 billion people are still \r\ntrapped in extreme poverty, which is a saddening fact. \r\nAn estimated 19,000 children under the age of five \r\nand approximately 800 women die every day mostly \r\nfrom preventable and curable diseases. That is totally \r\nunacceptable in a world of unprecedented advances \r\nin science and technology, which could be leveraged \r\nto solve almost all the development challenges facing \r\nhumankind. \r\nIn a world that has enough food to feed everybody, \r\nnobody should go hungry or be undernourished. In \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.16\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n16th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 27 September 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Therefore, improved \r\nagriculture will mean fewer poor people and fewer \r\nhungry people. Plans are also under way to expand \r\nthe conditional cash-transfer programme under the \r\nTanzania Aocial Action Fund supported by the World \r\nBank. We want to increase the size of investment to \r\nbenefit more vulnerable people, so as to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of MDG 1 in the shortest possible time.\r\nGenerally, it remains my firm belief that despite \r\nsome failures, the MDGs have been nothing short of \r\na remarkable success. If developed countries provided \r\nfinancing as envisaged under MDG 8 and in keeping with \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and their own commitments \r\nin different forums of the Group of Eight and Group \r\nof 20, we would have implemented all of the MDGs to \r\nthe letter and spirit. We find unrealistic any post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda that does not address the critical \r\nissue of ensuring adequate financing. That is also true \r\nwith regard to accelerating the implementation of the \r\nMDGs in the period remaining. We will continue to \r\nlook to the United Nations for guidance and leadership \r\nin steering both processes to a successful conclusion. \r\nThe fact that the United Nations needs reform is \r\na matter of little disagreement. Our collective failure \r\nto respond to that reality creates scepticism about \r\nour common resolve to strengthen the Organization, \r\nwhich is meant to serve all nations and peoples. The \r\nreform we demand is long overdue. While we welcome \r\ndiscussions on the reform of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, Africa will not relent in demanding reform \r\nof the Security Council so that the continent with \r\nthe largest membership in the United Nations has a \r\npermanent voice.\r\nRegrettably, conflicts have continued to interfere in \r\nour development endeavours, as they linger in different \r\nparts of the world — from the Sahel to the eastern part \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo and from Syria \r\nto Afghanistan and other places. Conflicts have caused \r\nan enormous loss of innocent lives, as populations \r\ncontinue to endure suffering. \r\nThe recent use of chemical weapons in Syria, as \r\nconfirmed by United Nations inspectors, is rather \r\ndistressing. We condemn that f lagrant and senseless \r\nkilling of innocent people, including children, in Syria. \r\nWe commend the Secretary-General and the Security \r\nCouncil for way they have handled the matter. I believe \r\nthe doors for a peaceful solution to the Syrian crisis are \r\nnot closed and that a military solution should be the last \r\nresort.\r\na world with so much wealth, there is no reason that \r\npoverty, hunger and deprivation should ever continue \r\nto inflict pain and cause misery to many people. It is \r\nincomprehensible, therefore, that the MDGs could not \r\nbe fully attained.\r\nTanzania has made significant progress in \r\nimplementing the MDGs. We have already achieved \r\nthe targets in four of the eight MDGs, well before the \r\ndeadline set of 2015. In MDG 2, we have achieved the \r\ntarget on universal primary education enrolment. On \r\nMDG 3, we have achieved the target of gender parity in \r\nboth primary and secondary school enrolment. That is \r\na change from the past, when there were more boys than \r\ngirls in schools. As a matter of fact, the trend is now \r\ntilting towards more girls than boys in school. We are \r\nyet to meet targets with regard to the ratio of females \r\nto males in tertiary education and in decision-making \r\npositions, in particular Parliament. However, it is \r\npossible to achieve the target for parliamentarians by \r\n2015 because we are now in the process of reviewing \r\nour Constitution.\r\nWe are on target with regard to reducing \r\nHIV/AIDS infections, which is the requirement of \r\nMDG 6. Similarly, we have attained MDG 4, on child \r\nmortality, which is a major achievement as compared \r\nto where we were in 2000. But it is depressing that we \r\nare not on track with regard to MDG 5, with regard to \r\nmaternal health. We are intensifying efforts to do better \r\nin order to improve the health of women in Tanzania.\r\nWith regard to MDG 7, on environmental \r\nsustainability, we are on target with regard to drinking \r\nwater for the urban population, but we are lagging \r\nbehind when it comes to rural water supply and access \r\nto improved sanitation, both in rural and urban areas.\r\nWe have not relented in our pursuit of the MDG \r\ntargets that we are not likely to achieve by 2015. That \r\nwill be the unfinished business on which we will \r\nprobably need to take action over and above what we are \r\ndoing. We are lagging far behind with regard to MDG \r\n1 in its four main indicators. There is not much chance \r\nof meeting those targets by 2015 despite the efforts we \r\nhave been making.\r\nHowever, we have been intensifying actions to \r\ntransform and modernize our agriculture. Our aim \r\nis to increase productivity and farmers’ incomes, as \r\nwell as to ensure food and nutrition security for them \r\nand the nation. Agriculture employs 75 per cent of the \r\nTanzanian population, and it is in that sector where the \r\n13-48790 3/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nbrave soldiers in Darfur and two in the eastern part of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. Those soldiers \r\nare our national heroes, and their sacrifice is not in \r\nvain. We hold them in very high regard.\r\nThe death of our peacekeepers was a grim reminder \r\nof the dangers facing peacekeepers around the world. It \r\nis disturbing that armed groups and peace spoilers are \r\nincreasingly attacking such servants of peace. We must \r\nunreservedly condemn all such attacks, as there is no \r\ncause or justification for such barbaric attacks. They \r\nconstitute a crime under international law. The Security \r\nCouncil, whose primary role is the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, should be in the \r\nforefront in terms of condemning such barbaric acts in \r\ngood time.\r\nAt this juncture, I wish to reiterate our call for \r\nan end to the unilateral economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba, which has lasted for \r\nmore than 50 years. Our call to end that unilateral \r\nembargo is predicated upon not only its legality but \r\nalso upon humanitarian concerns, in particular the \r\nnegative effects it has on the quality of life of many \r\ninnocent Cubans. We are deeply encouraged by recent \r\ndevelopments, especially the removal of restrictions on \r\nfamily travel, cash remittances and telecommunication \r\nservices. We hope that spirit will culminate in a total \r\ncessation of the embargo in the not-too-distant future so \r\nthat Cubans will be relieved of the enormous economic, \r\nsocial and financial hardships they have endured for far \r\ntoo long.\r\nA solution to the dispute over the sovereignty of \r\nWestern Sahara is also long overdue. It is high time \r\nthat the United Nations took bold action to give the \r\nSaharawi people an opportunity to decide their fate. It \r\nis incomprehensible that the Security Council, which \r\nhas been able to handle bigger security challenges, \r\nincluding in similar circumstances, has not been able \r\nto resolve the matter for nearly 40 years now. Justice \r\ndelayed is justice denied. \r\nMembers will agree that the Rome Statute, which \r\nestablished the International Criminal Court, was a \r\nmajor milestone for the international criminal justice \r\nsystem. The Court’s establishment as a mechanism for \r\nfighting impunity was possible only with the support \r\nof Africa. \r\nHowever, a decade after its entry into force, a rift \r\nhas grown between the Court and our continent. The \r\nCourt is perceived as unresponsive to what are, in our \r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania regrets to see the \r\nsuffering of the people of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo as a consequence of a conflict that has continued \r\nfor far too long. We hope that this time around, the \r\ninitiative of the Secretary-General that resulted in the \r\nestablishment of the Peace, Security and Cooperation \r\nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the Region, which was signed in February, will \r\ndeliver lasting peace, security and development for the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Great Lakes \r\nregion as a whole. We highly commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his vision and leadership in that regard. \r\nWe welcome the choice of Her Excellency Ms. Mary \r\nRobinson, former President of Ireland, as the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the Great Lakes \r\nRegion. She will surely help advance the cause of peace \r\nin the region, if supported by all of us in the region \r\nand the international community. Tanzania commits its \r\nsupport in that respect.\r\nAmong the enduring problems facing the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is the proliferation \r\nof armed groups with varied interests. Bolder action \r\nis required to uproot those negative elements. Those \r\ngroups should be neutralized and disarmed. It is in that \r\ncontext that we welcomed an expanded mandate for the \r\nUnited Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo as per Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2098 (2013), which, among other \r\nthings, established the Intervention Brigade. Tanzania \r\nagreed to contribute troops to the Brigade because we \r\nbelieve it will help to deter belligerence and create a \r\nconducive environment for a political process to take \r\neffect. Of course, any panacea for the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo problem will be political rather \r\nthan military.\r\nSince 2007, Tanzania has been a proactive \r\ncontributor to United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nWith more than 2,500 peacekeepers — in Lebanon, \r\nDarfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo — we \r\nare the sixth-largest contributor of military and police \r\npeacekeepers in Africa, and twelfth globally. We \r\nare partaking in that noble endeavour as a faithful \r\nMember of the United Nations, ready to perform the \r\nduty of advancing and upholding the ideals of the \r\nOrganization. We are satisfied that our contribution, \r\nalbeit modest, is having a broader impact on those who \r\nhave experienced the horrors of conflict. In discharging \r\nthat historic mission, however, our peacekeepers, and \r\ntherefore Tanzania, have sometimes paid the ultimate \r\nprice, as was the case recently with the loss of seven \r\n4/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nterrorism, a world where human rights are respected, \r\nthe rule of law is observed, democracy reigns and \r\ncivil society is regarded as an integral part of the \r\ndevelopment endeavour. With stronger multilateralism \r\nand the United Nations leading the way, and with \r\nstrong political will on the part of national leaders and \r\nthe people of our nations, everything is possible. We \r\ncan make our world a better place for everyone to live.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines.\r\nMr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nthe Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nFor the second time in my tenure as Prime Minister \r\nof Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, I have the \r\npleasure and honour to welcome a distinguished son \r\nof our Caribbean civilization to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Even as we thank your immediate \r\npredecessor for his service as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session, we look \r\nforward to your tenure, President Ashe, with boundless \r\npride and unbridled optimism.\r\nMr. President, for this year’s general debate, you \r\nhave chosen the theme “The post-2015 development \r\nagenda: setting the stage”. This is also the year in which \r\nyou will lay the groundwork for the United Nations \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, which will take place in Samoa next September. \r\nYour dual focus on the international development \r\nview, the legitimate concerns of African leaders and \r\nthe peoples of Africa. It continues to ignore repeated \r\nrequests and appeals by the African Union. It was sad \r\nto note that legitimate requests regarding the timing \r\nof the trials of President Uhuru Kenyatta and Deputy \r\nPresident William Ruto went unanswered. That attitude \r\nhas become a major handicap in terms of reconciling \r\nthe Court’s secondary and complementary role in \r\nfighting impunity. The Court’s rigidity has proved \r\ncounterproductive and threatens to undermine the \r\nsupport it enjoys in Africa. We demand a change in that \r\nperception.\r\nTanzania condemns in the strongest terms \r\npossible the cowardly attack that happened last week \r\nat the Westgate Mall in Nairobi, which left more than \r\n60 innocent people dead and hundreds more injured. \r\nI spoke and wrote to President Kenyatta to express \r\nour sadness and dismay. Yesterday, I signed the book \r\nof condolences at the Kenyan Mission to the United \r\nNations here in New York. I reaffirmed our solidarity \r\nwith President Kenyatta and the people of Kenya during \r\nthese difficult moments, as well as our solidarity in the \r\nfight against terrorism. \r\nThat heinous attack is a heartbreaking reminder of \r\nthe threat that terrorism poses to humankind. None of \r\nus is completely safe from terrorism, as it can happen \r\nanywhere, anytime and to anyone. We must therefore \r\nincrease our vigilance, enhance regional and global \r\ncooperation and scale up the fight against terrorism. \r\nThe challenge ahead of us can be neither underestimated \r\nnor understated. Success will depend upon our unity of \r\npurpose and determination. At this juncture, I would \r\nlike to commend His Excellency President Uhuru \r\nKenyatta for his exemplary leadership in the wake of the \r\nattack and his unshaken resolve and firm commitment \r\nto continue to support the peacebuilding efforts in \r\nSomalia and elsewhere. We are with the Kenyan people \r\nin this time of distress and grief.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress once more that \r\nwe are passing through a time of great opportunity \r\ndespite the many challenges. We must take advantage \r\nof the current scientific and technological innovations, \r\nthe current advances in information and communication \r\ntechnologies and the knowledge and lessons learned \r\nfrom the implementation of development programmes, \r\nincluding the MDGs, to build a world without poverty, \r\nhunger, disease and deprivation. \r\nWe must build a world that protects its environment \r\nand nature, a world without wars, conflicts or acts of \r\n13-48790 5/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nrelations. Surely the time has now come for this \r\nexemplar of the magnificent Chinese civilization to be \r\npermitted to participate fully in the work of the various \r\nagencies of this world body.\r\nOur debate on the future developmental agenda of \r\nthe international community is taking place against the \r\nbackdrop of the ongoing global economic and financial \r\ncrisis. The global economy remains precariously \r\npoised, and for every nation that seems to have turned \r\nthe corner, another plunges back into recession. The \r\nimpact of the crisis on development has been palpable \r\nand has rendered the MDGs unattainable in many \r\ncountries. Therefore, if we are to discuss the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, we must also discuss the \r\nreform agenda of our outmoded international financial \r\narchitecture, whose failings contributed to the current \r\ncrisis, and whose continued stasis is a reckless invitation \r\nto future economic turmoil.\r\nDespite the challenges of the ongoing exogenous \r\nshocks, including natural disasters, and the encumbrances \r\nimposed by an insufficiently f lexible international \r\nfinancial architecture, my country continues to make \r\nsignificant strides in our people-centred approach \r\nto development and poverty alleviation. This past \r\nJune, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines was one of \r\n18 countries recognized by the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO) for having \r\nachieved the part of Millennium Development Goal 1 on \r\nhalving the proportion of hungry people by 2015 — and \r\nwe have reduced it to below 5 per cent — and the more \r\nstringent World Food Summit goal of halving the \r\nabsolute number of hungry people by 2015.\r\nFor a small, vulnerable country to achieve this task \r\nahead of schedule and in the midst of this debilitating \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis is truly outstanding. \r\nWe have done so while maintaining and advancing \r\ngood governance, individual liberties and democracy \r\nin accordance with global best practices.\r\nBut the ambitions of my Government are far greater \r\nthan Goal 1 of the MDGs. Having more than halved \r\nhunger, we have now set our sights on the elimination of \r\nhunger altogether: to achieve zero hunger. We hope that \r\nthe United Nations and the international community \r\ncan partner with us effectively in fulfilling that historic \r\nambition. Our policy goal of ensuring that no man, \r\nwoman or child goes to bed hungry will have its own \r\npositive knock-on effects on poverty reduction, health \r\nand arresting the spread of chronic non-communicable \r\nagenda and the peculiarities of small island States make \r\nthis sixty-eighth session one of the most important in \r\nmy country’s 33 years of membership in the United \r\nNations.\r\nLet me first say that the people of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines are deeply pained at the horrendous acts \r\nof terrorism recently committed in Kenya. I reaffirm \r\nyet again our solidarity with the Government and the \r\npeople of Kenya.\r\nWilliam Shakespeare cautioned that what is past, \r\nis prologue. Similarly, Mr. President, your invitation \r\nto consider the future of the international development \r\nagenda requires us to first consider the ways in which \r\nour recent and long-ago steps and missteps shape our \r\nfuture developmental challenges and opportunities.\r\nI begin with an unfortunate, inconvenient truth: \r\nour collective failure to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) is largely rooted not \r\nin the shortcomings of earnest and hardworking \r\ndeveloping countries, but in developed countries’ abject \r\nabandonment of Goal 8, “Develop a global partnership \r\nfor development”. The Organization’s own MDG Gap \r\nTask Force noted in its report entitled “The Global \r\nPartnership for Development: The Challenge We Face” \r\nthat the quest for such a global partnership experienced \r\nsignificant backsliding in 2013 and that “the political \r\nmomentum for advancing international development \r\ncooperation seems to have waned”.\r\nSixteen of 25 developed countries decreased \r\ntheir aid budgets last year, and official development \r\nassistance (ODA) contracted for the second consecutive \r\nyear, the first such contraction since the creation of \r\nthe MDGs. In a time of crisis, when assistance is most \r\nneeded, ODA is itself in a deep and prolonged recession. \r\nThe twists and turns by so many developed countries \r\non this issue have been most disappointing. Without \r\npredictable f lows of meaningful, non-discretionary \r\nassistance, the post-2015 development programme will \r\nremain, substantially, a f leeting illusion to be pursued \r\nbut rarely, if ever, attained.\r\nAt the same time, I applaud the efforts of those \r\ndeveloped nations that take their ODA commitments \r\nseriously. I hail, too, a raft of other countries that are \r\nin a genuine developmental and functional partnership \r\nwith us. These include Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, \r\nVenezuela and Taiwan. Indeed, Taiwan, a country not \r\nwashed by our Caribbean Sea, has been remarkable in its \r\nprincipled and practical conduct of intergovernmental \r\n6/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nof our Caribbean, our indigenous populations, our \r\nAfrican descendants and, indeed, of Africa. I say to the \r\nAssembly that the struggle for reparations represents, \r\nimmediately, a defining issue for our Caribbean in the \r\ntwenty-first century. It promises to make both Europe \r\nand the Caribbean more free, more human and more \r\ngood-neighbourly. CARICOM recently decided, quite \r\nrightly, to place the quest for reparations at the centre \r\nof its development agenda.\r\nI am also compelled to speak today on a \r\ncontemporary injustice that is entirely within the \r\ncapacity of the Assembly to address. In 2010, negligent, \r\nor even reckless, United Nations peacekeepers \r\ncontaminated a Haitian drinking water supply, which \r\nled to an outbreak of cholera that killed 8,000 innocent \r\nHaitians and infected 600,000 others. There is no \r\nlonger any scientific dispute that the United Nations is \r\nresponsible for the outbreak, as has been conclusively \r\nestablished in the relevant reports. Prior to the United \r\nNations negligence, Haiti had not seen a single case of \r\ncholera in 150 years. There are more cholera-infected \r\npersons in Haiti today than in the rest of the world.\r\nI continue to be deeply disturbed by the callous \r\ndisregard of the United Nations of the suffering it has \r\nwrought in a fellow CARICOM country, and by the \r\nshameful and legalistic avoidance of what is a clear \r\nmoral responsibility on the part of the United Nations. \r\nAccordingly, I call on Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nto acknowledge unambiguously, and apologize for, \r\nthe Organization’s role in that tragedy and to take \r\nimmediate steps to compensate the victims and their \r\nfamilies. Anything less will further undermine the \r\nmoral authority and credibility of this institution.\r\nSixty-eight years ago, our predecessors conceived \r\nof a grand experiment, a commitment to bind the \r\nworld together in a collective quest for peace, justice \r\nand development. Over time, we have established a \r\nbody of rules, laws and expectations that add f lesh \r\nto the principles that undergird the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Now, we are engaged — explicitly \r\nand indirectly, willingly and reluctantly — in a \r\nreassessment of that grand commitment. Today, the \r\nactions of a small subset of powerful nations shake the \r\nvery foundations upon which the Assembly was built \r\nand threaten to bring the temple down upon the heads \r\nof those of us who still subscribe to the original tenets \r\nof our institution.\r\nProperly conceived and universally adhered to, \r\ninternational law is the bulwark against impunity, \r\ndiseases — which itself should also be of central \r\nimportance to our post-2015 development agenda.\r\nAs the Assembly is well aware, the roots of \r\nunderdevelopment and exploitation extend much \r\ndeeper than the recent abandonment of MDG Goal 8 \r\nby the bulk of developed countries. I arrived at this \r\nyear’s general debate from the Caribbean’s first-ever \r\nregional conference on reparations for native genocide \r\nand slavery, which was held in Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines. That stirring and uplifting regional \r\nconference was the first step in the Caribbean’s \r\nquest to address and redress a psychic, historical, \r\nsocioeconomic and developmental wound that is, for \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), 14 nations \r\nwide and 400 years deep.\r\nThe genocidal oppression and suffering of my \r\ncountry’s indigenous Callinago, the Garifuna and \r\nenchained Africans have been rightly adjudged to \r\nhave been a horrendous crime against humanity. \r\nAccordingly, the collective voice of our Caribbean \r\ncivilization ought justly to ring out for reparations for \r\nnative genocide and African slavery from the successor \r\nStates of the European countries that committed \r\norganized State-sponsored native genocide and African \r\nenslavement. \r\nThe awful legacy of those crimes against \r\nhumanity — a legacy that exists today in the \r\nCaribbean — ought to be repaired for the developmental \r\nbenefit of our Caribbean societies and all our \r\npeoples. The historic wrongs of native genocide and \r\nAfrican slavery and their continuing contemporary \r\nconsequences must be righted and repaired, in the \r\ninterests of our people’s humanity. \r\nEuropean nations must partner in a focused, special \r\nway with us to execute that repairing. The demand for \r\nreparations is therefore the responsibility not only of \r\nthe descendants, in today’s Caribbean, of the Callinago, \r\nthe Garifuna, the Amerindian and the African. It \r\nis undoubtedly an agenda for all of us to advance, \r\npromote, concretize and execute. The European nations \r\nthat engaged in conquest, settlement, genocide and \r\nslavery in our Caribbean must provide the resources \r\nrequired to repair the contemporary legacy of those \r\nhistoric wrongs. That is undoubtedly a special pillar in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThat repairing of the mind, of collective memory, of \r\nour economies and of our societies is part and parcel of \r\nthe rebirth, the redemption and the further ennoblement \r\n13-48790 7/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nThe issue certainly entails enormous complexities but, \r\nunless it is resolved satisfactorily, sustainable peace \r\nin the Middle East will remain unattainable. Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines hopes that current moves \r\ntowards serious negotiations will bear fruit in line with \r\nthe principles and mandates that have been spelled out \r\nrepeatedly in various United Nations resolutions.\r\nAt the same time, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nis very impressed by the efforts of the President of \r\nthe United States to embrace diplomacy rather than \r\nmilitary intervention in pursuit of a political settlement \r\nin Syria. The Syrian community in my country, rightly \r\nand anxiously, looks forward to peace in its troubled \r\nhomeland. Only the extremists will benefit from a \r\nprolonged civil war. Still, peace cannot be sought \r\nreasonably when a precondition of regime change \r\nis advanced. All sides in the conflict must make real \r\ncompromises in the interests of the Syrian people as a \r\nwhole.\r\nThere is one emerging issue of consequence that \r\nneeds to be addressed. It concerns the deeply disturbing \r\nrecent reports of the widespread and unrestrained \r\nspying that has allegedly been conducted by the United \r\nStates of America against a number of countries, \r\nincluding its staunchest allies. Indeed, there are reports \r\nthat the practice of such electronic espionage is rife, \r\neven within the halls and offices of the United Nations. \r\nWe strongly reject such activity as illegal, a violation \r\nof diplomatic conventions and an affront to the comity \r\nof nations. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines believes \r\nthe agenda for appropriate corrective action in that \r\nregard, as outlined earlier this week by the President \r\nof Brazil, to be fair, reasonable and achievable by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nAs we continue our collective journey in the quest \r\nfor greater and lasting global peace, we are reminded \r\nthat wars do not erupt only between countries, but also \r\nwithin them. We also know that some of the highest \r\nnumbers of violent deaths occur in countries that are \r\napparently at peace. \r\nThis year, the international community has \r\nrecognized that genuine and lasting peace between and \r\nwithin nations, cities and villages cannot occur in an \r\nenvironment that allows an unregulated trade in small \r\narms and light weapons. The Arms Trade Treaty, which \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines signed on the very \r\nfirst day that it opened for signature, is far weaker than \r\nwe would have liked. Nonetheless, we consider it to be \r\nan important first step in regulating the illicit f low of \r\nunilateralism, and Great Power triumphalism. Today, \r\nthere are those in the Assembly who hold a curious view \r\nof international law, as something that must be imposed \r\nagainst others but which has limited applicability \r\nto themselves. To some in the Assembly it seems \r\nappropriate to disregard international law in the very \r\nenforcement of their distorted view of international law. \r\nClearly, such conduct is unacceptable, for the simple \r\nreason that it threatens the continued legitimacy of our \r\nentire multilateral system.\r\nSmall, vulnerable States, by definition and \r\nnecessity, are those most reliant upon an enforceable \r\nbody of equitable international law within an effective \r\nsystem of multilateral diplomacy. It is no surprise, \r\ntherefore, that small States like my own have emerged \r\nas some of the strongest defenders of multilateralism, \r\nsovereignty, diplomacy and the rule of law. We view \r\nit as our responsibility to sound the alarm when this \r\ninstitution threatens to depart from the founding \r\nprinciples that bind us together.\r\nAccording to basic reason and historical experience, \r\nno nation is intrinsically superior to another and no \r\npeople are innately better than nothers. To be sure, there \r\nare cultural and social differences, but being different \r\ndoes not imply a condition of being better or worse. \r\nOne nation may be more powerful than another, but \r\nthat circumstance should never permit the powerful to \r\nascribe arrogantly to themselves, in laughable vanity, \r\nthe doctrine of exceptionalism. Inevitably, that vain \r\nascription swiftly degenerates into an embrace of the \r\ndamning path of the rightness of unilateral force, rather \r\nthan an uplifting multilateral force of rightness.\r\nFlagrant examples of a continuing disregard for \r\ninternational law abound. Surely, it diminishes a \r\ngreat nation such as the United States of America to \r\ncontinue with what I consider to be a myopic vendetta \r\nagainst Cuba by way of an illegal, outdated and hurtful \r\neconomic blockade and the absurd declaration that \r\nCuba is a sponsor of terrorism. All right-thinking \r\npersons across the world justly demand that the United \r\nStates end the economic blockade against Cuba and \r\nremove its name from the unilaterally drawn up list \r\nof States that allegedly sponsor terrorism. It makes \r\nno sense whatsoever for international law to become a \r\nprisoner of domestic politics and the vain glories of a \r\nGreat Power. \r\nSimilarly, the plight of the Palestinian people is \r\nbeing sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, with \r\na disregard for the opinions of almost all of humankind. \r\n8/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Ralph E. Gonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister of the Independent State  \r\nof Samoa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): I congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I also wish also to thank you for your \r\ncontinued strong support for small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) issues, which you have championed for \r\nmany years and have once again demonstrated, this \r\nweek, in the process and lead-up to the United Nations \r\nThird International Conference on Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, to be held in the Pacific next year.\r\nFrom economic woes to outright poverty, from \r\nsocial instability to acts of violence and ethnic or \r\nreligious conflict, and from the devastation of natural \r\ndisasters to deadly acts of terrorism, no country is \r\nspared or completely shielded. The events in Kenya, \r\nIraq, Pakistan and here in the United States over the past \r\nweek demonstrate the multiple risks we face in today’s \r\nworld. Our sympathies go to the Governments and \r\npeople of those countries, and our deepest condolences \r\nto the people who lost family and friends in those tragic \r\nevents.\r\nWhile the Organization continues to grapple with \r\nvarious serious problems that require collective, United \r\nNations-led action for their resolution, perhaps the \r\ngreatest threat we face today is climate change. Climate \r\nchange is a security risk of far greater proportions than \r\nsmall arms and light weapons worldwide, particularly \r\ninto the Caribbean region, where the tide of guns is \r\noften accompanied by torrents of narcotics as they \r\nmake their way to markets in other countries.\r\nI am deeply disappointed at the international \r\ncommunity’s endless, rudderless and seemingly \r\nvacuous negotiations on climate change. Our failure \r\nto achieve meaningful progress on this matter of \r\nexistential urgency is inexcusable. Vulnerable countries \r\nlike Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are on the front \r\nline of climate change and are already bearing the brunt \r\nof the increasing fallout of global warming. Meanwhile, \r\nthe major emitters and historical polluters pay callously \r\ninsincere lip service to our plight. For them, combating \r\nclimate change is a question of dollars and cents, not \r\nlife and death. They are only too happy to see the \r\nmultilateral process fail, so that they can retreat into \r\nineffectual and painless national commitments. But \r\nthose stubborn obstacles to progress must no longer \r\nbe allowed to stand in the way of the survival and \r\ndevelopment of vast swaths of our planet.\r\nI applaud the initiative of the Secretary-General \r\nto convene a high-level event on climate change in the \r\nhope that such a meeting will give our meandering \r\nnegotiations impetus and direction. The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda will not survive global warming \r\nif it goes unchecked. It is also high time for genuine \r\nnegotiations in good faith and for meaningful resources \r\nto assist in mitigating and adapting to the effects of \r\nclimate change.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall that the Charter \r\nof the United Nations begins with the phrase “We the \r\npeoples of the United Nations.” It is not “We the rich \r\npeoples”, nor “We the militarily powerful peoples” \r\nnor “We the peoples of large countries”; but “We the \r\npeoples” — of the entire world, the whole membership \r\nof this institution. The United Nations does not exist \r\nto confer benefits to select groups, but to secure peace \r\nand development for all. If we are to set the stage for \r\nthe future of development, that stage must be inclusive \r\nso that all nations and peoples have a significant part to \r\nplay and a stake in the outcomes. Let us make ourselves \r\nworthy successors of the ennobling, humanizing vision \r\nof our venerated founding fathers and mothers. \r\nI shall be saying this ages and ages hence: two \r\nroads diverge in the woods, and I have chosen the one \r\nless travelled by, and that has made all the difference. \r\n13-48790 9/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nhands to cause instability. Indeed, within our own \r\nPacific region, such so-called small arms have fuelled \r\nconflicts, disrupted the lives of communities and \r\nimpeded countries’ development. The Arms Trade \r\nTreaty, when fully implemented, will greatly help small \r\nisland States like mine in their efforts to sustain our \r\ncommunities’ security and stability. Our signing of the \r\nATT is also further testimony to our firm commitment \r\nto general and complete disarmament, since it will \r\ncontribute significantly to saving lives, stopping human \r\nrights abuses and avoiding crises, and is an important \r\nstep in reducing and eventually eliminating altogether \r\nthe human cost of conventional arms.\r\nSamoa remains fully committed to the peacekeeping \r\nwork of the United Nations, one of the Organization’s \r\nmost effective and successful mandates. For more than \r\n10 years, Samoa has been contributing civilian police \r\nofficers to peacekeeping operations in countries such \r\nas South Sudan, Timor-Leste, Liberia, the Sudan and, \r\nin the Pacific, the Regional Assistance Mission to \r\nthe Solomon Islands. We will be in a better position \r\nto increase our contribution to peacekeeping missions \r\nafter a United Nations selection, assistance and \r\nassessment team has completed its evaluation, which is \r\nplanned to take place before the end of 2013, of eligible \r\nofficers from our police force.\r\nSamoa looks forward to next week’s High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development. \r\nInternational migration poses both challenges and \r\nopportunities for countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination. Its contribution to sustainable development \r\nwill therefore ultimately depend upon the willingness \r\nof source and destination countries to work out \r\nimaginative and humane arrangements that benefit \r\nboth those countries and migrants. Samoa is working \r\nclosely with New Zealand and Australia, through \r\ntheir seasonal-worker schemes, to ensure that those \r\nimportant initiatives result in mutual benefit for both \r\nthe sending and receiving parties in the arrangements.\r\nYesterday’s High-level Meeting on Nuclear \r\nDisarmament (A/68/PV.11) highlighted yet again the \r\nurgent need for a treaty banning nuclear weapons, \r\ngiven the catastrophic humanitarian consequences \r\nof any use of such weapons. Such weapons represent \r\nthe great paradox of our time. While nations desire \r\npeace and talk of peace, far more of the national wealth \r\ngoes towards the development and acquisition of ever \r\nmore sophisticated and destructive weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Our Pacific region was the scene of a great \r\nmany people are prepared to admit. For some low-lying \r\nPacific island countries, climate change may well lead \r\nto their eventual extinction as sovereign States. \r\nThe singular importance and urgency of climate \r\nchange to our region was given added prominence today \r\nwhen Pacific Forum leaders met with Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon. Our Chair, the President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, presented to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, \r\nwhich is an effort by our region — the most likely to be \r\nfirst and worst affected by climate change — to launch \r\na new wave of more determined leadership across the \r\nglobe, aimed at accelerating the reduction and phasing \r\ndown of the world’s greenhouse-gas pollution before it \r\nis too late.\r\nMr. Touré (Guinea), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe root causes of climate change and the means for \r\naddressing them are widely known. We in the Pacific \r\nknow already from bitter and harsh experience, as will \r\nmany other parts of the world, what the consequences \r\nof climate change are, and they will only become more \r\nsevere if not enough is done. \r\nSadly, what is evident to us in the climate change \r\nnegotiations is the continued triumph of vested interests \r\nin preventing and delaying the action that should be \r\ntaken. In a diverse world of different capacities and \r\ncapabilities, those least able to mitigate and adapt to \r\nthe impacts of climate change look to Member States \r\nin leadership roles to rise to the challenge and lead by \r\nexample, to ensure that the post-2020 climate change \r\nconvention currently being negotiated will effectively \r\naddress the mounting fears of countries like mine of \r\nthe catastrophic effects of climate change if it is not \r\ntackled collectively and with determination. As world \r\nleaders, we have the responsibility for fashioning a new \r\nagreement that will reassure low-lying islands that we \r\nhave their interests and priorities at heart. Let us rise to \r\nthe occasion and be part of the solution.\r\nIn June, during the historic event of the signing of \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), Samoa announced that \r\nit would sign the Treaty at the highest political level \r\nduring the Treaty event at the General Assembly’s \r\ncurrent session. We kept that promise, and I signed \r\nfor Samoa in a special ceremony two days ago. We \r\nwelcome the fact that more than 100 nations, including \r\nthe United States, have now signed the Treaty. \r\nFor small island countries like Samoa, it takes \r\nonly a few small arms and light weapons in the wrong \r\n10/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\ndestruction and, now, their use in Syria is unnerving. \r\nThe untold suffering brought about by the Syrian \r\ncrisis has touched many hearts, and the latest episode, \r\nwhere we watched in utter disbelief the use of chemical \r\nweapons to kill indiscriminately defenceless victims \r\nand even children, is incomprehensible.\r\nWe therefore welcome the joint proposal by the \r\nUnited States and Russia and the willingness of \r\nSyria to have its chemical weapons destroyed under \r\nthe competent United Nations authority. We expect \r\ntotal compliance, which is required for this initiative \r\nto succeed. As long as weapons of mass destruction \r\nsuch as chemical weapons continue to exist, some \r\nmegalomaniac will sooner or later resort to their use, \r\nwith deadly consequences for the world. The ultimate \r\nsafeguard is, of course, the destruction of all such \r\nweapons, whether chemical, biological or nuclear.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment called for the convening in 2014 of a Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, to remind the international community that small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) face unique challenges \r\nand vulnerabilities requiring dedicated support and to \r\nhelp build their resilience.\r\nSamoa is honoured to host that Conference in \r\nSeptember 2014, on behalf of the Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping countries. The Barbados interregional \r\nmeeting endorsed “The sustainable development of \r\nsmall island developing States through genuine and \r\ndurable partnerships” as the overarching theme of the \r\nConference. A renewed global partnership will help \r\nSIDS to manage a multitude of risks, so that they can \r\npursue inclusive economic growth, social development \r\nand environmental sustainability.\r\nSamoa has also proposed to utilize the Conference \r\nas a platform to launch specific, concrete SIDS \r\npartnerships as the most effective means to implement \r\nsome of the group’s challenges and as a legacy of the \r\nConference.\r\nIn advancing the SIDS development agenda, \r\nthe Samoa Conference strategically provides a \r\nwindow for SIDS as a group to agree on their \r\npriorities and to consolidate their positions ahead of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s leaders’ summit on \r\nclimate change in 2014, the post-2015 United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda now under discussion, and the \r\nnegotiations for a successor climate-change treaty post-\r\n2020, which are in progress.\r\ndeal of nuclear testing, with some islands still bearing \r\nthe scars of those tests. Our regional response was the \r\nSouth Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, the Rarotonga \r\nTreaty, to ensure that nuclear testing in the Pacific \r\nwould be a thing of the past.\r\nSamoa reaffirms its continued support for a \r\nnuclear-test-free world. Early agreement must be \r\nreached to ban nuclear testing and to cease the creation \r\nand manufacture of more nuclear weapons.\r\nWe place great faith in the rule of law and the vital \r\nprotection it offers to all States, especially to weak \r\nand small countries such as mine, with no armed force \r\nand not affiliated with any military grouping. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) is an important \r\npart of the architecture of world peace based on the \r\nrule of law, and we are pleased to have been the second \r\nState party to ratify the two Kampala amendments to \r\nthe Rome Statute last year. With the deposit yesterday \r\nof the ninth instrument of ratification, we hope that \r\nthe Kampala amendments will come into force soon \r\nand that the ICC will become the first court since the \r\ninternational military tribunals in Nuremburg and \r\nTokyo to hold individuals responsible for crimes of \r\naggression.\r\nThe United Nations needs to adapt to the changing \r\ncontemporary international environment or risk being \r\nbypassed in favour of institutions and groupings that \r\nare more responsive to the needs of Member States. The \r\nHigh-level Political Forum is one such welcome reform, \r\nand Samoa is very pleased to have participated in its \r\ninaugural meeting this week.\r\nStill more fundamental reform is required to address \r\nthe existing imbalances in the current power structure \r\nof the Security Council through the enlargement of \r\nboth categories of membership and improvements to \r\nits working methods, so as to reflect the realities of \r\nthe present time and to enhance the Council’s role and \r\neffectiveness.\r\nThe renewed efforts made and great courage \r\nshown in the process of restarting the stalled Middle \r\nEast peace plan for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples \r\nhas our strongest endorsement. It gives rise to hope \r\nthat the two-State solution, which is the only option \r\nwith realistic prospects for lasting peace, can still be \r\nachieved.\r\nThe number of areas of tension and trouble \r\nspots around the globe is increasing, and they are \r\ngetting deadlier. The availability of weapons of mass \r\n13-48790 11/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nof the Nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, \r\nand his visionary call, in his first appearance before the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in 1974, for a world order based on \r\npeace and justice and a global economic arrangement to \r\nfree the world of poverty, hunger and aggression. As his \r\ndaughter, I am proud to have been among leaders who \r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration in 2000, to have \r\nbeen at the review of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in 2010 and to be participating now \r\nin the transition from the MDGs to the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nI hope that this year’s theme — “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage” — will help us \r\nto design a pragmatic strategy for those goals. The Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand the newly established High-level Political Forum \r\nare making good progress. Our experience also will \r\nbe useful in overcoming the challenges to the MDGs \r\nby 2015 and in preparing the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nBangladesh has submitted to the United Nations \r\na draft of the post-2015 development agenda that \r\ncovers socioeconomic and environmental goals and the \r\nresources required for achieving them. We also held a \r\nGlobal Leadership Meeting on Population Dynamics \r\nin Dhaka, whose declaration placed human individuals \r\nat the centre of the entire development agenda. The \r\ndeclaration incorporated population growth, ageing, \r\nurbanization and migration as the priority issues. \r\nThe meeting also strongly identified the need for \r\nmainstreaming migration in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, particularly to accommodate the expected \r\nclimate migrants.\r\nOur aim is to become a middle-income country \r\nand to realize our Vision 2021 by setting goals that \r\nare in line with the MDGs. We have already met or \r\nare on track to meet Millennium Development Goals \r\n1 through 6. Poverty has been reduced from 56.6 per \r\ncent in 1991 to below 26 per cent today. In the past four \r\nand a half years, the average gross domestic product \r\ngrowth rate remained at 6.4 per cent; 50 million people \r\nhave joined the middle income group; export earnings \r\nrose from $10.53 billion in 2006 to $27.03 billion \r\ntoday; remittances increased from $5 billion in 2006 \r\nto $14.5 billion; foreign currency reserves improved \r\nfrom $3.49 billion in 2006 to $16 billion; and power \r\nproduction capacity also increased from 3,200 \r\nmegawatts in 2006 to 9,059 megawatts today, to name \r\na few indicators.\r\nLet me conclude by conveying our gratitude to \r\nall our partners — developed and developing, big \r\nand small, Governments and non-governmental \r\norganizations, civil society and the private sector — for \r\ntheir dedicated support, which has helped my country \r\nto reach a new threshold in its journey as a State \r\nMember of the United Nations. Our new status as a \r\nnon-least developed country beyond January 2014 can \r\nbe sustained only with the support of Samoa’s truly \r\ngenuine and durable partners.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of \r\nthe People’s Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Sheikh \r\nHasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I congratulate \r\nPresident Ashe very warmly on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. I congratulate also Mr. Vuk Jeremić for his able \r\nleadership as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-seventh session. I admire the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his wisdom, bold initiatives and \r\nsuccesses as head of the United Nations.\r\nRapid technological innovations are transforming \r\nour world. The changes involved are also creating new \r\nconflicts within and among States. The vulnerable, the \r\ndeprived and the disadvantaged have been the most \r\naffected. That reminds me of my father and the Father \r\n12/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nmaternity allowances for a total of 4.3 million \r\npeople; and food and nutrition security for more than \r\n1 million rural people through One House, One Farm \r\nschemes, to name a few. The disadvantaged and the \r\nphysically challenged are provided with education, \r\nskill development and interest-free loans for self-\r\nemployment and, in the formal sector, a 1 per cent quota \r\nhas been reserved for them. For those with autism and \r\nother developmental disorders, a resolution on autism \r\nspectrum disorder was introduced by Bangladesh at \r\nthe sixty-seventh session of the General Assembly \r\n(resolution 67/82). It was adopted, unifying us all in our \r\nquest to provide them their rightful place in the world.\r\nHowever, our progress in all spheres has been \r\nsadly held back because of climate change. Fraught \r\nwith increasing natural disasters, Bangladesh faces \r\na calamitous future due to global warming and sea \r\nlevel rise. It is estimated that a 1˚ Celsius increase in \r\ntemperature would lead to a 1 metre rise of the sea \r\nlevel, submerging one fifth of Bangladesh and forcing \r\n30 million climate migrants to move elsewhere, \r\nthereby creating crisis of a huge magnitude within \r\nand beyond our borders. I therefore reiterate the call \r\nthat I made at the sixty-fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly (see A/64/PV.4) for a legal regime to ensure \r\nthe social, cultural and economic rehabilitation of \r\nclimate migrants. I again call for a fast-track funding \r\nmechanism for least developed countries to ensure \r\nsustained funding for the realization of our adaptation \r\nand mitigation action plans on climate change.\r\nBangladesh achieved independence in 1971 \r\nthrough monumental sacrifices. Our sacrifice began \r\nwith bloodshed to preserve our mother tongue, \r\nBangla, on 21 February 1952. At my Government’s \r\ninitiative, UNESCO immortalized that sacrifice in \r\n1999 by UNESCO by its declaration of 21 February as \r\nInternational Mother Language Day. The measures we \r\nhave taken so far in that regard include the establishment \r\nof the International Mother Language Institute in Dhaka \r\nand asking the United Nations to declare Bangla as one \r\nof its official languages. I thank the United Nations for \r\nintroducing a Bangla website and radio programme, \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme for \r\npublishing its Asian report in Bangla. \r\nDuring our 1971 war of liberation, Pakistani \r\noccupation forces — in collaboration with their local \r\ncohorts — perpetrated genocide, rape, arson and \r\ncrimes against humanity. More than 3 million people \r\nsacrificed their lives and a quarter of a million women \r\nBangladesh is therefore often called a model of \r\neconomic development and the standard-bearer of \r\nSouth Asia. Our achievements received an MDG award, \r\na South-South Award, a Global Diversity Award and \r\na food award for 2013 from the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations. Those recognitions \r\nwere achieved largely due to the practice of the \r\nprinciples found in the resolution entitled “People’s \r\nempowerment and development” (resolution 67/107), \r\nwhich I submitted and which the General Assembly \r\nadopted at its sixty-seventh session. \r\nUsing state-of-the-art digital technology, people \r\ntoday are getting more than 200 services from 4,582 \r\ndigitized Union Information and Service Centres. \r\nRural women are also receiving health-care services \r\nfrom 15,500 digitally interconnected community health \r\nclinics and union health centres, which have extended \r\nhealth-care services to people’s doorsteps. Advanced \r\ncell phone technologies are also providing services to \r\nmore than 100 million subscribers.\r\nI believe that real national development is achievable \r\nonly through education. Education is the main driving \r\nforce for attaining the peace and prosperity of a nation \r\nand for upholding justice, the rule of law, democratic \r\nvalues and people’s empowerment. Real development \r\nalso demands the empowerment of women and their \r\nequal participation with men in all walks of life. \r\nOur new educational policy provides girls free \r\neducation up to higher secondary school, monthly \r\nstipends for 11.9 million students of poor families, and \r\nfree textbooks to all students up to the secondary level. \r\nOur policies have also helped develop women leaders \r\nfrom the grass roots to the topmost level. In politics, \r\nso far, 14,000 women have been elected to local \r\nGovernment bodies and 70 to Parliament. Five women \r\nare serving as Ministers and one as Whip. Bangladesh \r\nis possibly the only nation today with women occupying \r\nthe position of Prime Minister, Speaker, Leader of the \r\nOpposition and Deputy Leader, all at the same time. \r\nThe 10 per cent of posts reserved for women have helped \r\nmany succeed in reaching high positions in the judicial \r\nand administrative branches, in diplomatic posts and in \r\nthe armed forces and law enforcement agencies.\r\nOur policies of empowering the people, particularly \r\nthe vulnerable, include social safety-net programmes, \r\nsuch as vulnerable group feeding and development; \r\nhousing and livelihood for the homeless; monthly \r\npensions for senior citizens, widows, destitute women, \r\ninsolvent freedom fighters and people with disabilities; \r\n13-48790 13/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nto the dictum of the Father of the Nation, “Friendship \r\ntowards all, malice towards none”.\r\nOur commitment to global peace is proved by \r\nour role as a top troop-contributor in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations and as a Vice-Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. It is also reflected by \r\nour position on disarmament and the nonproliferation \r\nagenda. During my first term as Prime Minister, from \r\n1996 to 2001, Bangladesh became the first South Asian \r\nnation to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty and the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention. \r\nIn my current term, I am happy to again be the first in \r\nthe region to have signed the Arms Trade Treaty, and \r\nto have acceded to the remaining instruments of the \r\nConvention on Certain Conventional Weapons at this \r\nyear’s treaty-signing event. Our role in world affairs \r\nis based on justice and democratic values, with the \r\naim of ensuring international peace and security and \r\nsupporting disarmament. \r\nThe promotion of cultural expression and interfaith \r\nand intercultural dialogue is essential for peace and \r\ndevelopment in the post-2015 era. My personal initiatives \r\nto disseminate those values at home and abroad were \r\nrecognized by UNESCO in 2012, when we were awarded \r\nthe Cultural Diversity Medal. Culture is integral to the \r\nidentity of every State Member of the United Nations. \r\nTherefore, my country has proposed — to UNESCO and \r\nin the General Assembly’s thematic debate on culture \r\nand development — including culture as a theme of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. I reiterate that call here \r\ntoday and request the support of all present.\r\nBangladesh is hampered by resource constraints \r\nand inadequate external assistance. To achieve the \r\nMDGs by 2015 and to implement the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment goals, we need our development partners \r\nto honour their pledges to contribute 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross national product (GNP) as official development \r\nassistance (ODA) and 0.2 per cent of GNP as ODA to \r\nthe least developed countries (LDCs). I urge them to \r\nalso grant LDCs duty-free and quota-free access to \r\ntheir markets, as well as an equal voice in the Bretton \r\nWoods and international financial institutions and \r\nthe free movement of labour. The implementation of \r\npart IV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \r\nis also essential for the benefit of both sending and \r\nreceiving countries.\r\nThe elaboration of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda is a daunting task for all States Members of the \r\nlost their honour to achieve independence. Since then, \r\nit has been the ardent hope and aspiration of the nation \r\nto bring the perpetrators to justice. Accordingly, our \r\nGovernment constituted two war crimes tribunals \r\nunder the international crimes tribunals act of 1973 \r\nto try them. The trials are being held with the highest \r\nstandards of judicial practices. The successful \r\ncompletion of the trials would heal the wounds of \r\nwar and move Bangladesh on to the road of peace and \r\nprogress. I urge the international community to support \r\nthe trials process for the sake of justice, human rights \r\nand the rule of law. \r\nThe anti-liberation forces have always been working \r\nto destroy the secular nature of our nation. Under the \r\ndirect patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-\r\nJamaat alliance Government from 2001 to 2006, they \r\ncoalesced to form terrorist outfits, which began with \r\nbomb and grenade attacks killing people, especially \r\nsecular leaders and members of Parliament. On \r\n21 August 2004, they made an attempt to assassinate \r\nme by lobbing 13 grenades at a public rally that I was \r\naddressing to protest the grenade attack on the British \r\nHigh Commissioner on 21 May 2004. In that attack, \r\n24 people were killed and more than 500 injured. \r\nMiraculously, I survived. As members are aware, earlier \r\na more brutal attack was carried out, on 15 August \r\n1975, killing my father, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur \r\nRahman, the Father of the Nation, and 18 members of \r\nmy family. My younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, and I \r\nsurvived only because we were out of the country at \r\nthat time. The gruesome attacks cemented my resolve \r\nto eliminate terrorism and to adopt tough anti-terrorism \r\nand anti-money-laundering acts. \r\nAt home, our Government is entrenching democracy \r\nin order to ideologically defeat terrorism and extremism. \r\nOur commissions on elections, anti-corruption, human \r\nrights and information have been strengthened. During \r\nour Government’s tenure, the elections commission has \r\nconducted 5,777 elections, electing 63,995 persons to \r\nthe Parliament, city corporations, municipalities and \r\nother local bodies, without receiving any complaint. \r\nThe elections commission has therefore amply proven \r\nthat it can hold free, fair and credible national elections. \r\nWith respect to foreign affairs, we aim to cement \r\npeace by resolving outstanding issues with our \r\nneighbours, by increasing cooperation with them \r\nthrough strengthening connectivity and by maintaining \r\ngood relations with all countries of the world according \r\n14/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nPresident Ashe on his election and wishing him great \r\nsuccess in presiding over the General Assembly. I \r\nwould also like to congratulate the outgoing President, \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić, on his successful presidency. I also \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his leadership in \r\nstrengthening the United Nations ability to respond to \r\ntoday’s and tomorrow’s challenges.\r\nEach year in September, world leaders gather in \r\nNew York to develop joint responses to challenges. That \r\nis a great challenge for all — national Governments, \r\ninternational and regional organizations, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector. We share the primary \r\nresponsibility for a peaceful and secure world that \r\nensures the rights and interests of individuals, nations \r\nand countries within the framework of the rule of \r\nnational and international law. That was also the \r\nobjective when the United Nations was established \r\nfollowing the Second World War.\r\nWe thank the President and the Secretary-General \r\nfor their engagement and leadership in the work to \r\nestablish the new post-2015 development framework, \r\nbuilding upon the Millennium Development Goals to \r\ninclude an economic, social and ecological dimension \r\nof sustainable development. What is important for \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda — an ambitious \r\nand complex project — is the building of a global \r\npartnership among Governments, the private sector, \r\ncivil society and individuals, including the mobilization \r\nof institutional and human resources. \r\nThe environment must be a key building block of \r\nsustainable development: it is nature that sustains us, \r\nand its resources should be used wisely. Economic \r\ngrowth facilitates human growth, reduces poverty and \r\nfacilitates better education and health care and is thus \r\na crucial element of any development framework. The \r\nRepublic of Macedonia will fully contribute to the \r\nachievement of all global objectives through its national \r\nagenda, in which investment in education, health, \r\nagriculture and food, the environment and infrastructure \r\nand the partnership between the Government and the \r\nbusiness community are the highest priorities.\r\nPeace, conflict resolution and human rights \r\nprotection are United Nations goals. Today they \r\nrepresent an even a greater challenge, which we should \r\nrespond to and overcome. The Republic of Macedonia \r\nsupports the approach of the United Nations in \r\nresponding to those challenges. We actively contribute \r\nto the promotion of peace on an international level, \r\nUnited Nations. We must be united in agreeing on a \r\ncommon framework for the development agenda that \r\nwould fulfil our aspiration to build a just, prosperous \r\nand sustainable world where no person or nation is \r\nleft behind. Bangladesh, representing 160 million \r\nprogressive and resilient people, will lead those efforts \r\nup front.\r\nThe globalized world has unique complexities \r\nthat sometimes threaten peace. Justice-based policies \r\nare imperative to eradicate such threats. Justice is \r\nthe panacea for peace that enables development and \r\nprogress, which in turn dispel the challenges posed to \r\nfreedom, democracy, human rights, the environment \r\nand the equitable sharing of transboundary resources \r\nsuch as water, among others, as well as the challenges \r\nposed by climate change. \r\nOur resolution on the culture of peace, introduced \r\nat the Assembly every year, is drafted in that spirit and \r\nis always adopted by consensus. It conveys the message \r\nof mutual respect for peoples and nations in our bid \r\nfor a world of peace and promise. I believe that we all \r\naspire to such a world for our future generations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for the \r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nikola Gruevski, Prime \r\nMinister of the former Yugoslav Republic  \r\nof Macedonia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Nikola Gruevski, Prime Minister of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Nikola \r\nGruevski, Prime Minister of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Gruevski (former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia) (spoke in Macedonian; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): Allow me to begin by congratulating \r\n13-48790 15/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nIt is difficult, I would say even impossible, for someone \r\nto find a legal justification for such an objection.\r\nThe fact that the overwhelming majority of countries \r\nhave recognized our constitutional name — the Republic \r\nof Macedonia — with more than 135 of them being \r\nUnited Nations Members, clearly shows that most of \r\ncountries do not believe that the dispute has a justified \r\nbasis, or if it does they denounce it. I believe that this \r\nissue was a created one, a classic case of politicization \r\nand an instrument that, approximately 20 years ago, was \r\neither supposed to make someone score some political \r\npoints or, by creating an atmosphere of conflict, to \r\nbring about some strategic regional shifts, as well as to \r\nslow down the spread of freedom, democracy and the \r\nintroduction of market economies in the Balkans.\r\nAt the last session, the General Assembly discussed \r\nthe rule of law, with all Member States unanimously \r\nagreeing that respect for internationally agreed norms \r\nand principles was a must. Unfortunately, norms are not \r\nalways adhered to. The United Nations must be neither \r\nidle in that regard nor renege from its responsibility to \r\ncounter any disrespect for the rule of law.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia became a United \r\nNations Member in 1993 with an atypical membership \r\ncondition, namely, the denial of its constitutional name. \r\nIt was admitted with an interim country reference — an \r\nunprecedented event in history that was contrary to the \r\nprovisions of international law. But we have endured all \r\nthat, although it lingers to date as a problem.\r\nIn 1995, under United Nations mediation, we \r\nsigned an interim accord with Greece by which we \r\nchanged our f lag and parts of our Constitution, while \r\nGreece undertook not to create obstacles to our NATO \r\naccession in 2008. Not only did Greece obstruct our \r\nact of accession to the international Organization \r\nitself, it also obstructed the processes for opening the \r\nmembership procedures in another organization. For \r\nfour years in a row, Greece has prevented the start \r\nof negotiations for our membership in the European \r\nUnion. \r\nOn the basis of our appeal concerning the \r\nobstructions of Greece with regard to our application \r\nfor membership, in 2011 the International Court of \r\nJustice\\ —  a principal organ of the United Nations \r\nestablished by States Members and located at The \r\nHague — issued a judgment that Greece had violated \r\ninternational law by not adhering to the interim accord \r\nand that the Republic of Macedonia had not violated \r\nparticipating in international missions that safeguard \r\nfreedom and democracy.\r\nWith regard to one of the major issues — the crisis \r\nin Syria and the internal conflict that has created more \r\nthan 100,000 victims and 2 million refugees — what \r\nis more troubling is that chemical weapons were used \r\nagainst the Syrian people while diplomatic efforts \r\nwere under way, although their use is strictly prohibited \r\nunder international law. That must not be tolerated. We \r\nare among the countries to have asked for an urgent \r\ninvestigation under the auspices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s mechanism for the investigation of the alleged \r\nuse of chemical and biological weapons. \r\nDespite differing views, all member States of \r\nthe Security Council and of the United Nations agree \r\nthat to achieve a final resolution of the Syrian crisis, \r\nthe political approach should be given a chance. It \r\nis therefore essential to focus maximum effort on \r\nrevitalizing the search for a political settlement and to \r\nconvene the “Geneva II” conference as soon as possible. \r\nThe Syrian people deserve better days through decisive \r\naction by the international community that will end the \r\nviolence and threats.\r\nThe region of South-East Europe has entered a \r\nphase of positive development, and in general the \r\nnational and regional primary objectives are either \r\nfulfilled or are within reach. Regional cooperation \r\nis expanding in a number of new fields. Despite such \r\nadvances, certain long-standing unresolved or partly \r\nresolved bilateral issues are clearly having a negative \r\nimpact on our present and immediate future. In the \r\ncase of the Republic of Macedonia, that happens to be \r\na serious obstacle to our agenda for integration into \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia is celebrating the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of its United Nations membership \r\nwith the still unresolved issues of the use of the name \r\nof my country, the Republic of Macedonia, and of the \r\nidentity of my people, the Macedonian identity. Those \r\nquestions emerged because of a dispute raised by our \r\nsouthern neighbour Greece, which opposes our name, \r\nwhich is our fundamental individual and collective \r\nright. The issue, which should have been promptly \r\nresolved among neighbours, partners and future allies, \r\nhas lasted for 22 years. While being a very realistic \r\nproblem for my people, this is an issue that I deeply \r\nbelieve is essentially hypothetical and does not have any \r\nbasis in international law or in the United Nations acts. \r\n16/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\ndoes not allow them to be called Macedonians or the \r\nlanguage that they speak to be called the Macedonian \r\nlanguage, despite the fact that for more than half a \r\ncentury there have been departments in universities \r\nthroughout the world where the Macedonian language \r\nhas been studied and it has been called the Macedonian \r\nlanguage. It is the same as if somebody denied an \r\nindividual the right to speak French, German, Polish, \r\nEnglish, Dutch, Portuguese, Japanese, Hindi or any \r\nother language. \r\nThe United Nations must not overlook the violation \r\nof the basic human right to decide one’s own name, and \r\nshould take action to enable the exercise of that right. \r\nIn this particular case, the United Nations should take \r\naction that will lead to the settlement of the outstanding \r\nissues that Greece has with us.\r\nAt the previous session, we debated preventive \r\ndiplomacy and concluded that it should be an essential \r\nelement of the international community. Therefore, the \r\nUnited Nations must not, and should not, stand aside \r\nin this process, which severely hinders Macedonia’s \r\naspirations to a better future for its citizens. \r\nCommitment is necessary to make it possible for \r\nGreece to begin resolving this issue, because in the past \r\ntwo years there has been great inertness on the part of \r\nGreece. Although that is a result of objective reasons \r\ncaused by its adverse economic situation, it also entails \r\na strategic and tactical political element based on the \r\nanalysis that prolonging the process of solving the \r\ndispute would contribute to the Republic of Macedonia \r\nbeing isolated in its positions, which are based on \r\ninternational law and values, and to its resignation to a \r\nkind of self-annihilation of the State and the nation by \r\nagreeing to be renamed. \r\nAccording to that line of thinking, with the lack \r\nof commitment in the discussions and the blocking \r\nof European and Euro-Atlantic integration that my \r\ncountry faces — integration that is directly hindered \r\nby the dispute despite our having met the standards \r\nrequired of us by the international multilateral \r\norganizations, NATO and the European Union — we \r\nwould thus be prevented from joining and face the \r\npossibility of internal misunderstandings regarding \r\nthe hindrance caused by our southern neighbour, and \r\nwe would drop our guard in spite of the force of the \r\narguments, which are on our side. It is true that by \r\nputting off the solution of the dispute, more challenges \r\nin the country and the region are created, and the tension \r\nbecomes greater at certain moments. But it should be \r\ninternational law or the commitments it had agreed to. \r\nHowever, we were hindered again, notwithstanding the \r\ndecision of the highest body of justice in the world, \r\nand that is apparent to the Assembly and its member \r\ncountries.\r\nThe United Nations was established in order to \r\nprotect international law. There is no regulation of \r\ninternational law that restricts a country from calling \r\nitself as it wishes, or restricts its citizens from being \r\nable to be called and named as they wish. Naming is \r\none of the five prerogatives of States, as well as an \r\nundisputed right of every Member country.\r\nWhy do we need international law if we do not \r\nadhere to it? If we turn a blind eye to that injustice \r\nand obvious violation of international law, we will be \r\ndirectly responsible for breaking one of the principles of \r\nworld peace and of the United Nations. We do not want \r\nthat, nor can we allow it. If it were not for international \r\nlaw, anarchy would reign and the United Nations would \r\nbecome a debate club without any basic competencies. \r\nWe do not want to participate in that, at the expense of \r\neverything, even to our own detriment.\r\nNot respecting international law also means having \r\nno respect for the 50 million victims that fought for it \r\n70 years ago, as well as going against the decisions of \r\nour predecessors — the founders of the Organization. \r\nInternational law should not be a platitude, but rather \r\nshould provide a solution to every challenge.\r\nAccording to international law, the Republic of \r\nMacedonia is entitled to decide on its own name and to \r\nuse the word Macedonian to denote its ethnic identity. \r\nSettling our differences with our southern neighbour is \r\nour priority, but only and precisely within the United \r\nNations resolutions that define the solution that is \r\nthe subject of discussion, and by reaching a mutually \r\nacceptable solution. We should settle our differences in \r\nno other way, especially not by expanding those limits.\r\nSixty-six years after the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, this dispute, unjustly \r\nimposed on us by Greece, violates one of the \r\nfundamental rights of the individual — the right to \r\ndecide one’s own name. Every representative of my \r\npeople is denied the right to be called as they wish, as \r\ntheir mothers and fathers, grandparents and all other \r\nancestors throughout history were called: Macedonian. \r\nIn addition to disputing the constitutional name of \r\nmy country — the Republic of Macedonia — Greece \r\nalso disputes the identity of my citizens, that is, it \r\n13-48790 17/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nActions speak of the one who undertakes them. \r\nWith our openness and with our justified initiative, we \r\nare showing that we wish for a solution to be found. \r\nHowever, our meetings must not be purely a formality; \r\nrather, they must have substance and must not create \r\nan alibi for not finding a solution. I am convinced that \r\nonly a substantial commitment by the international \r\ncommunity, above all by the United Nations, will lead to \r\na solution, taking into consideration the basic documents \r\nof the United Nations on the rights of countries and \r\nindividuals, the United Nations resolutions that defined \r\nthe talks, agreements guaranteed by the United Nations, \r\nthe decisions of United Nations bodies and international \r\nlaw as a whole.\r\nHowever, if there is no progress, the United \r\nNations must not remain inactive and be satisfied with \r\nthe status quo, as that would mean showing further \r\nirresponsibility. Aware of this already discouraging \r\nsituation, the United Nations should help via its \r\norgans, through the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil. It is on the basis of Security Council resolution \r\n817 (1993) that we are in discussions with our neighbour \r\nto arrive at a solution that will free the identity of my \r\ncountry. Otherwise, the United Nations will be faced \r\nwith failure again and will bear the responsibility for \r\nnot having acted in accordance with its own principles \r\nand values. \r\nI do not want to spare anyone. We all have \r\nresponsibility, including the Organization. Instead \r\nof assuming that responsibility, the Organization \r\nhas accepted the comfort of remaining silent and not \r\nresolving the dispute; instead of defending itself, it has \r\nremained inactive with regard to the status quo, which \r\nis obviously creating problems and challenges for the \r\nregion. It should start considering alternative scenarios \r\nand doing more to stimulate a solution to this long-\r\nstanding dispute.\r\nI am confident that we have the capacity to jointly \r\nrespond to the challenges. In the name of the people \r\nthat we represent, we must assume responsibility for the \r\npresent and the future. Assuming such responsibility \r\nmeans taking decisions, changing habits and reinforcing \r\ncooperation and prosperity, but it is something that can \r\nbe done. That is the responsible way to proceed.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nclear to everyone that such challenges should not be \r\nconsidered a trigger for any changes of our justified \r\nand internationally correct position that would lead to a \r\nchange in our Macedonian identity. \r\nIt is not possible to change something that has \r\nexisted for centuries by imposing blockages or by threats \r\nabout possible misunderstandings, tensions or unrest, \r\nnot even by implementing them. The Macedonian \r\npeople will never accept being renamed. If it is not \r\npossible for that issue to be resolved now — although \r\nwe are the ones who are most interested in its resolution \r\nand we sincerely wish for a sustainable, balanced \r\nand, most important, mutually acceptable solution to \r\nbe found — then some other generation in different \r\ncircumstances will be able to resolve it, but precisely \r\non the basis of the values, positions and principles \r\nthat I mentioned before, which indicate a just and fair \r\nsolution, without winners and losers. \r\nHowever, I personally believe that we must not \r\nleave those thorny issues to future generations. We \r\nmust try to find a solution and find strength to provide \r\nprosperity for the countries and the region. It is said \r\nthat actions speak solely of those who undertake them. \r\nFaced with the lack of interest by the Hellenic Republic \r\nin substantive talks for a solution to the dispute, two \r\nmonths ago I suggested to the Greek Prime Minister a \r\nchange in the format of discussions, that is, raising them \r\nto a much higher political level. I as a Macedonian and \r\nhe as a Greek Prime Minister, together with ministers \r\nfrom both Governments, would meet directly and talk \r\nabout a solution. That would lead to greater efficiency, \r\nbecause we are the ones most often called upon to solve \r\nthe issue. Twenty-two years is too much time to not get \r\nanywhere and is sufficient proof that there must be a \r\nchange in the game. \r\nOur mandate, entrusted to us by the citizens, \r\nshould be essential to achieving a mutually acceptable \r\nsolution — which I believe can be attained — a \r\nsolution that will be accepted and agreed upon by the \r\ncitizens of our countries. The examples of Serbia and \r\nKosovo, as well as those of Croatia and Slovenia, where \r\npolitical representatives at the highest level managed \r\nto overcome challenges, are the best proof that results \r\ncan be achieved in that way. I invite the Assembly to \r\ndirectly take part in the realization of this initiative, \r\novercome the standstill and, through its commitment, \r\nprovide intensity and forward movement, as well as \r\ngreater interest on the part of Greece in a solution and \r\nprogress. \r\n18/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nthe progress made, we are deeply concerned for regions \r\nin the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, that require \r\nurgent and effective action, as well as for those countries \r\nexperiencing conflicts and post-conflict situations \r\nwhere the population lives in extreme conditions.\r\nSan Marino, like many other countries, believes that \r\nin setting the fundamental objectives of the post-2015 \r\nagenda, due account must be taken of the challenges \r\nthat in the course of the past years — that is, since the \r\nadoption of the Millennium Declaration — have become \r\nmore urgent. Among the challenges, peace and security, \r\nthe elimination of inequalities and environmental \r\nsustainability are, in our view, top priorities, not only \r\namong States but also within States, owing to their \r\nmagnitude and urgent nature.\r\nPeace is the indispensable condition for building \r\nand fully implementing a development model centred \r\non the human individual. Therefore, dialogue and \r\nnegotiation, as tools to resolve conflicts, should be \r\npursued with greater effort and determination by the \r\nentire international community, which considers this \r\nsearch to be a fundamental mission of the Organization.\r\nSimilarly, when crimes against humanity are \r\ncommitted — crimes that the Secretary-General has \r\nrecently denounced and documented, after a strong \r\ncondemnation — united action to eliminate chemical \r\nand nuclear weapons is needed in order to avoid \r\nresponding to violence with violence. Too many violent \r\nconflicts have recently defined the internal life of some \r\nStates and the relations among them. There are far too \r\nmany dead, in particular civilians, to talk of satisfactory \r\nconditions of peace. But peace can be founded only \r\non respect for human rights, social justice and the \r\nemancipation of the weakest segments of society.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino reasserts its own \r\ncommitment to the goal of a world free of any form \r\nof racism and racial discrimination, where the freedom \r\nof expression and association, and above all the \r\nfreedom of religion, are guaranteed and the personal \r\nfulfilment of individuals is ensured. To that end, we \r\nshall be guided by the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. Furthermore, San Marino praises the high-level \r\nmeetings marking the first part of the session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, because the themes discussed are \r\nnot only urgent but also extremely important.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has always paid special \r\nattention to the most vulnerable groups, such as women, \r\nchildren, the elderly and the disabled. Today, women are \r\nMr. Nikola Gruevski, Prime Minister of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on Mr. Pasquale Valentini, Minister for Foreign \r\nand Political Affairs, Tourism and Relations with the \r\nPublic Utilities State Corporation of the Republic of \r\nSan Marino.\r\nMr. Valentini (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe Government of San Marino, I wish to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his election as \r\nPresident of the of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session. His long experience as Ambassador of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda and his in-depth knowledge of \r\nthe Organization are precious resources for the United \r\nNations. The Republic of San Marino supports the \r\nessential elements of his programme, mentioned in his \r\ninaugural address (see A/68/PV.1), and ensures its full \r\ncooperation in all work of the General Assembly. \r\nMy country also wishes to express special thanks to \r\nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nenergy, commitment and extraordinary determination \r\nto the benefit of the United Nations. We appreciate \r\nthe sensitivity demonstrated by the Secretary-General \r\ntowards all Member States, without distinction, and \r\nhis constant presence in all international politically \r\nrelevant and emergency situations. His visit this year \r\nto our Republic on the occasion of the Investiture \r\nCeremony of Their Excellencies the Captains Regent \r\nmarked a significant moment in the history and public \r\nlife of our small State, and was an honour for the San \r\nMarino people.\r\nThe theme chosen this year’s session — “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage” — places \r\nat the heart of our debate the need to pursue the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and to comply with \r\nthe obligations undertaken. It also serves to reaffirm \r\nthat it is only through the determined commitment of \r\nthe Organization that those Goals can be effectively \r\nachieved.\r\nWe believe that significant progress has been made \r\nin achieving many of the Goals, such as the eradication \r\nof extreme poverty, access to drinkable water, \r\ncombatting HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and \r\nthe improvement of the health conditions of women \r\nand children. However, we are well aware that the full \r\nachievement of those objectives is still far off. Despite \r\n13-48790 19/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nMy country’s priorities include environmental \r\nsustainability and the prevention of and response to \r\nnatural disasters. Over the last years, certain regions \r\nof the world have been shaken by unprecedented \r\nnatural disasters. In Asia, Latin America and Africa, \r\nin particular in the Horn of Africa, local communities \r\nhave suffered from extreme conditions, experiencing \r\nthe tragic consequences of their vulnerability and of \r\nfood and health uncertainty.\r\nOur thanks go to the Secretary-General, the Office \r\nfor the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the \r\nCentral Emergency Response Fund for their prompt and \r\ncrucial intervention in favour of populations affected \r\nby natural disasters. However, individual Member \r\nStates must do more and give rapid and effective \r\nsupport to populations in emergency situations, both by \r\ninvesting in the most vulnerable regions so as to build \r\nthe capacities necessary for preventive action and by \r\nproviding them with the moral and financial support \r\nnecessary to cope with disasters.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino attaches great \r\nimportance to the issue of preventing and responding to \r\nnatural disasters. Despite its small size, it ranks fifty-\r\nfirst on the list of donors to the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund.\r\nLastly, the finalization of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda cannot be separated from a discussion on the \r\nstrengthening of global governance mechanisms, since \r\nthe achievement of the new development goals will be \r\nthe result of cooperation among all Member States. \r\nSan Marino believes that the United Nations has the \r\nduty to retain its leadership role in global governance \r\nmanagement.\r\nMy country is a traditional sponsor of the annual \r\ndraft resolution entitled “The United Nations in global \r\ngovernance”, to be submitted in 2013 for the third time. \r\nIt reiterates the need for a more inclusive, transparent \r\nand effective approach to solving the world’s problems \r\nand recognizes the central role to be played by the \r\nUnited Nations in global governance.\r\nIndeed, the highly democratic nature and the \r\nuniversal character of the United Nations grant it \r\nindisputable legitimacy and a patrimony deriving from \r\nthe cultural diversities and the traditions it represents. \r\nThis leads to an approach focusing on humankind and \r\nthe promotion of human rights in which the needs of the \r\nentire international community are taken into account. \r\nIndeed, global problems require global solutions.\r\nstill the victims of discrimination and violence in many \r\nparts of the world, including in the most developed \r\ncountries. In the poorest regions of our planet, maternal \r\nmortality remains a challenge. Moreover, women are the \r\nmost vulnerable to HIV infection. Trafficking in women \r\nis far from being resolved. Women are often subject \r\nto abuse and to humiliating and degrading treatment, \r\nincluding polygamy, child marriage, kidnapping and \r\nsexual violence, including domestic violence. Women \r\nliving in conflict and post-conflict situations are often \r\nsubject to sexual violence, mass rape, torture, summary \r\nexecutions.\r\nThe advancement of women’s rights and the \r\nelimination of all barriers to their full participation in \r\npolitical, economic and social life must be top priorities \r\nfor the United Nations, along with the promotion of their \r\neconomic opportunities and equality in all sectors.\r\nThe United Nations has the duty to protect children, \r\nthe most vulnerable victims of violence, abuse and \r\nexploitation. In the most poverty-stricken areas of the \r\nworld, the infant mortality rate is still unacceptable \r\nand a very high number of children suffer from chronic \r\nmalnutrition, which is the main cause of child mortality. \r\nMy country hopes for the universal ratification of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional \r\nProtocols and their full implementation.\r\nThe international community must strive for the full \r\ninclusion and participation of people with disabilities in \r\nthe economic, social and cultural life of the community. \r\nDespite the significant steps forward taken over the \r\nlast years in terms of equality and non-discrimination \r\nagainst disabled persons, much remains to be done for \r\nthe implementation of the Convention on the Rights \r\nof Persons with Disabilities, through the adoption of \r\nlegislative measures and national and international \r\npolicies. The Republic of San Marino welcomes the \r\nconvening of the High-level Meeting on the Realization \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and Other \r\nInternationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons \r\nwith Disabilities (see A/68/PV.3) and fully supports its \r\noutcome document (resolution 68/3).\r\nIn particular, it must be stressed that the protection \r\nof disabled persons can be more easily achieved if the \r\nsocial and economic policies of individual States and \r\ninternational organizations pay due attention to the \r\ninstitution of the family as the natural environment \r\nin which human beings are born and develop their \r\nawareness of the rights and duties regulating coexistence \r\namong people.\r\n20/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\ntireless efforts to build a safer and more prosperous \r\nworld.\r\nThe numerous challenges that the United Nations \r\nis currently facing are far more complex than previous \r\nones. Those challenges are such that all of us have to \r\nensure, through joint efforts, coordinated and efficient \r\naction to overcome them. That is our moral, collective \r\nobligation towards the well-being of future generations.\r\nThe challenge of achieving sustainable development \r\nand integrating its three dimensions is the greatest of \r\nthem all. It is encouraging that the General Assembly, \r\nbound by the Rio outcome document (resolution \r\n66/288, annex), is successfully addressing this priority. \r\nWith the establishment of the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals, the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing and the High-level Political Forum, the \r\ninstitutional framework as a platform for substantive \r\nwork has been strengthened.\r\nIn that context, the role of the United Nations \r\nand the results of efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 are becoming \r\nmore important than ever. I am certain that the United \r\nNations, guided by the synergy and pragmatic approach \r\nof its Members and all stakeholders, will be able to \r\nrespond to that highly complex challenge. Such an \r\napproach will contribute to our well-being and a safer \r\nfuture for all of us, further strengthening the central \r\nrole of the United Nations in the system of global \r\ngovernance. \r\nTo that end, poverty eradication and the other \r\nunmet MDGs must remain at the heart of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. We must define future \r\nsustainable development goals on the basis of the \r\nexperience and lessons learned from our success or \r\nfailure in accomplishing the tasks set by the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). Montenegro is working \r\ndiligently on the MDGs and is close to meeting them.\r\nOur sustainable development goals must be clear, \r\nuniversal, f lexible and coherent, and represent a central \r\npart of the post-2015 global development agenda. They \r\nmust clearly reflect political commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and promote economic development, \r\nsocial inclusion, the sustainable use of natural resources \r\nand protection of the environment as well peace and \r\nsecurity. As a member of the Open Working Group \r\non Sustainable Development Goals, Montenegro is \r\nworking assiduously to define those goals, taking into \r\nAgainst that background, our Organization must \r\nadapt. The political role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly, and reform of the Security Council, are the \r\ncore issues of such a reform process. The demands \r\nmade today by the peoples of North Africa and the \r\nMiddle East require a review of working methods \r\nand the decision-making process in order to ensure \r\nthat solutions are reached in the context of which the \r\ninterests and positions of all parties concerned are duly \r\ntaken into account.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has always believed \r\nin the power of dialogue, democracy and respect for \r\nothers. That is why, in its centuries-old history, it has \r\nnever fought any war. Drawing on that experience, \r\nwe believe that — and this is our contribution to the \r\ngeneral debate — the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the definition of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nneed to be set within this perspective.\r\nAddress by Mr. Milo Dukanović, Prime Minister \r\nof Montenegro\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro.\r\nMr. Milo Dukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Milo \r\nDukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Dukanović (Montenegro) (spoke in \r\nMontenegrin; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nIt is a great honour for me to address the Assembly \r\ntoday on behalf of Montenegro and to reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the United Nations and its Charter.\r\nI wish to congratulate President Ashe on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-eighth session and to express the full support \r\nof the Montenegrin delegation to him personally and \r\nfor the programme he has put forward. I wish also to \r\nextend my gratitude to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, \r\nour neighbour, for his energetic efforts and leadership, \r\nwhich contributed to dynamic and constructive \r\ndiscussions on various issues on the United Nations \r\nagenda. It is a special pleasure for me to pay tribute \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\n13-48790 21/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\ndeterioration of the situation in Syria and most strongly \r\ncondemn any form of violence, killing of civilians and \r\nviolation of human rights. We especially condemn the \r\nuse of chemical weapons confirmed by the United \r\nNations inspection team, which Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon has labeled a war crime. We urge that those \r\nresponsible for crimes in Syria and for violations of \r\ninternational law be brought to account. \r\nThe agreement reached between the United \r\nStates and the Russian Federation gives us hope for \r\na diplomatic solution to the crisis and an end to the \r\nconflict in Syria through resolute action on the part \r\nof the Security Council. We believe that a political \r\nsolution and a democratic transition are the only way \r\nto end a tragic conflict that has led to a humanitarian \r\ncrisis of incalculable proportions, affecting the whole \r\nregion.\r\nThe case of Syria, among others, highlights the \r\nimportance of preventive measures and mediation \r\nin preserving international peace and security. \r\nStrengthening the capacity of the United Nations to \r\nachieve an early response and suppress threats before \r\nthey become a source of conflict will be key to dealing \r\nwith similar situations in future. Montenegro supports \r\nthe promotion of the concept of the responsibility to \r\nprotect and its operationalization, with prevention as \r\nan integral element. We are in favour of continuing the \r\ndebate on the international community’s responsibility \r\nfor taking timely and decisive action to prevent mass \r\nsuffering.\r\nIn the context of the situation in the Middle East, \r\nwe are particularly pleased by the resumption of \r\nPalestinian-Israeli negotiations after several stalled \r\nyears, and we commend the mediation efforts of the \r\nUnited States Secretary of State. Montenegro believes \r\nthat direct negotiations are the best way to reach a \r\ncomprehensive and sustainable settlement.\r\nWith the intention of taking on additional \r\nresponsibilities and contributing to the promotion \r\nof global peace and security and the observance of \r\nuniversal values, rights and freedoms as a responsible \r\nand proactive member of the international community, \r\nMontenegro is seeking a non-permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council for 2026-2027.\r\nBesides its strong support for improving the \r\nconception and structural development of United \r\nNations peacebuilding and peacekeeping capacities, \r\nMontenegro recognizes the importance of the rule of \r\nconsideration national characteristics and capacities \r\nand individual countries’ development priorities.\r\nAfter three years of strong economic growth in \r\nMontenegro, the global economic and financial crisis \r\naffected us, too, leading to a drop in investment, banks’ \r\ncredit activities and foreign trade. The patterns of \r\neconomic growth have changed, so we have adapted \r\nour economic policy to the new circumstances. At the \r\nsame time, the Government has adopted a medium-\r\nterm development plan modeled on the European \r\nUnion’s Europe 2020 strategy. The three pillars that \r\nMontenegro will base its sustainable development on \r\nare smart growth, sustainable growth and inclusive \r\ngrowth. The national plan will make our structural and \r\ninstitutional reforms more consistent with development-\r\noriented public measures and investments. Aware of \r\nthe importance of that issue, we are setting up a centre \r\nfor sustainable development in Montenegro that will \r\nbecome operational in early 2014. We hope that in time \r\nit will take on a regional role and become part of the \r\nSustainable Development Solutions Network, based on \r\nthe outcome of the 2012 United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nOne issue that is inseparable from the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment framework is that of climate change. \r\nMontenegro is committed to intensifying its efforts \r\nto promote the adoption by 2015 of a comprehensive \r\nand legally binding agreement that would apply to all. \r\nWe call on every country, in particular the major world \r\neconomies, to step up their efforts related to mitigating \r\nthe impact of climate change and reaching a global \r\nclimate agreement. In that regard, we emphasize our \r\nfull support for the Secretary-General’s initiative in \r\nconvening a conference on climate change in September \r\n2014.\r\nThe maintenance and promotion of international \r\npeace and security is a continuing challenge for the \r\nUnited Nations. We note that in some crisis areas, such \r\nas Mali, significant progress has been made in reducing \r\nviolence and instability, while the situations in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \r\nRepublic, the Sudan and South Sudan still need the \r\ncontinued attention and efforts of the Security Council \r\nand other relevant actors.\r\nDue to the overall consequences for the country \r\nitself and for the broader region, the crisis in Syria \r\nregrettably still monopolizes the attention of the global \r\nbody politic and is at the top of the agenda of the United \r\nNations. We are deeply concerned about the continuing \r\n22/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nis essential, as are revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nand reforming the Economic and Social Council. In \r\ngeneral, such reform, particularly of the Security \r\nCouncil, would contribute greatly to strengthening the \r\nposition, relevance and authority of the Organization \r\nas a whole and bringing it into harmony with modern \r\ngeopolitical processes and challenges. \r\nMontenegro’s work within the Organization is \r\nbased on the principle of multilateral cooperation and \r\nrespect for the principles and values enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We are aware of the \r\nimportance to our visibility and effectiveness at the \r\ninternational level of strong and stable neighbourly \r\nrelations and of strengthening cooperation in all areas.\r\nWe are successfully implementing the internal \r\nreforms required for the achievement of our main \r\nforeign policy priorities — membership in the European \r\nUnion and NATO. The accession negotiations with the \r\nEuropean Union, after the provisional closing of two \r\nchapters, are entering a new and more demanding \r\nphase. The new approach in that phase of the process \r\nis based on reforms in the areas of the rule of law, \r\nstrengthening judicial processes and the protection of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, which are of \r\nparticular importance for the citizens of Montenegro.\r\nIn parallel, my country is strongly committed to \r\nEuro-Atlantic integration. As a country that will soon \r\nbecome a NATO member, we are working devotedly \r\non the fourth annual national programme and reform \r\nimplementation in order to be fully ready by the time \r\nour invitation for alliance membership is formalized. \r\nWe believe that membership will also contribute to \r\nreinforcing security in the Balkans, where events of the \r\nrecent bitter past can be attributed, in part, to a lack of \r\nstrong security arrangements.\r\nMontenegro is seen as a stability factor in our \r\nregion, as confirmed by continuing advances in \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural cooperation \r\nwith all of its neighbours. With regional cooperation \r\nhigh on our agenda, Montenegro actively participates \r\nin regional organizations. We believe that the recently \r\nlaunched West Balkans 6+2 initiative, the modalities of \r\nwhich are the subject of intense discussion, will help \r\nus to focus regional activities on specific development \r\nprojects of common interest to participating States that \r\nare aimed at speeding up European integration and \r\nimproving the quality of life of our citizens. We believe \r\nthat those efforts, together with European Union \r\nsynergy, the South-East European Cooperation Process \r\nlaw and the protection of civilians, particularly women \r\nand children, and urges United Nations missions to \r\nconsistently fulfil their mandates in that area. We \r\ncondemn all forms of violence, especially sexual \r\nviolence against women and girls in conflict situations, \r\nand we therefore support the implementation of the \r\nagenda on women and peace and security and, in that \r\ncontext, Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and \r\nother relevant resolutions.\r\nThe adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty as the first \r\nlegally binding instrument in that area will undoubtedly \r\ncontribute to global efforts in the field of disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation. I am pleased to emphasize that \r\nMontenegro was a firm supporter of a comprehensive \r\nand strongly worded Arms Trade Treaty from the outset \r\nand was among the first 65 countries to sign it. We are \r\nconscious of how important it is that the Treaty enters \r\ninto force as soon as possible and will therefore make \r\nevery effort to ensure its speedy ratification.\r\nThe increased integration of human rights into \r\nevery aspect of the work of the United Nations, ensuring \r\nuniversal respect for human rights, and the effectiveness \r\nof the United Nations system in the area of human rights \r\nconstitute the guidelines for action for Montenegro, \r\nespecially through the Human Rights Council, of which \r\nmy country is a member. By cooperating actively with \r\nthe Council and its special proceedings, as well as with \r\nMember States, we contribute to timely and efficient \r\ndeliberations on issues relating to the promotion of \r\nhuman rights and responding adequately to cases of \r\nhuman rights violations. \r\nAt the national level, we are striving to strengthen \r\na political, social and economic environment that \r\nallows for the free exercise of human rights without \r\nany form of discrimination. We focus particularly \r\non strengthening the position and role of women in \r\nsociety and on preventing violence against them and \r\nother vulnerable groups, including children, disabled \r\npersons and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and \r\ntransgender community. As Chair of the Decade of \r\nRoma Inclusion for 2005-2010, Montenegro has also \r\nfocused particularly on improving the position of Roma \r\nin our society.\r\nMontenegro remains committed to an effective \r\nmultilateral system in which the United Nations plays \r\na central role, and we support pragmatically oriented \r\ninitiatives and actions for its reform. We believe that \r\nreforming and reorganizing the Security Council, as \r\nthe key actor in the maintenance of international peace, \r\n13-48790 23/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nhave improved. Yet along with those accomplishments \r\nhave come latent dangers. The long-standing dream \r\nshared by people across the world of living a safe, \r\npeaceful, prosperous and happy life free from hunger \r\nremains far from achieved.\r\nHumankind yearns for peace, so why is it that \r\nmany regions remain under the constant threat of \r\ndisputes, conflicts and wars? The global economy is \r\ngrowing, so how is it that billions of people still live in \r\nabject poverty? Science and technology have brought \r\nabout outstanding advancement, so why have natural \r\ndisasters, epidemics and pollution become increasingly \r\nsevere and unpredictable? Those questions impose an \r\nenormous responsibility on all of us, as the community \r\nof nations.\r\nThroughout history, wars have destroyed many \r\ncivilizations. In only the past 100 years, two world \r\nwars and many others — including that in Viet \r\nNam — have cost millions of lives and produced \r\ndevastating consequences over generations. While \r\npeace, cooperation and development are the dominant \r\ntrend, the threat of war is ever present. \r\nViolence in the Middle East and North Africa is of \r\ngrave concern. The latest instance in Syria, involving \r\nthe use of chemical weapons, needs to be strongly \r\ncondemned. We must give peace every possible chance \r\nand find solutions to eliminate chemical weapons, in \r\naccordance with international law and United Nations \r\nresolutions. \r\nUnpredictable developments in the Korean \r\npeninsula persist. Territorial disputes still rage in the \r\nEast China Sea and South China Sea. Just one single \r\nincident or ill-conceived act could trigger conflict, or \r\neven war.\r\nIn the East China Sea, through which over half \r\nof the world’s shipping passes, maintaining maritime \r\nsecurity and freedom of navigation is critical, not only \r\nto the region but to the world. Viet Nam consistently \r\npursues a policy of peaceful resolution of disputes to \r\ndefend its legitimate interests and fully respect those of \r\nthe global community, in accordance with international \r\nlaw, the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea, the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties \r\nin the South China Sea, other regional agreements, and \r\nefforts to elaborate a code of conduct.\r\nHo Chi Minh used the words of Thomas Jefferson \r\nin Viet Nam’s Declaration of Independence:\r\nand the Regional Cooperation Council, will draw the \r\nStates of the region closer together and to the common \r\ngoal of the European Union.\r\nThe international community, led by the United \r\nNations, with the active participation and decisive \r\ncontributions of all stakeholders, must continue its \r\nsearch for adequate responses and channel its efforts \r\ntowards solving the increasingly complex issues and \r\nchallenges that we are facing. Each and every country, \r\nirrespective of size, has, without any doubt, a part to \r\nplay in finding such solutions, based on the mutual \r\ntrust and cooperation necessary to build a better world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Milo Ðukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Nguyen \r\nTan Dung, Prime Minister of the Socialist Republic \r\nof Viet Nam, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Nguyen Tan Dung (Viet Nam) (spoke in \r\nVietnamese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nIt is a distinct honour for me to address this forum. \r\nI would like to extend my sincere congratulations to \r\nMr. John Ashe on his assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I am \r\ncertain that under his leadership, the Assembly will \r\nsuccessfully define the post-2015 development agenda \r\nat this session. I would also like to express my deepest \r\nrespect to the Secretary-General for his significant \r\ncontributions to the continuing work of the United \r\nNations.\r\nOver the past 100 years, the miraculous advances \r\nof science and technology have changed our world \r\nprofoundly, making it appear smaller. People’s lives \r\n24/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nill and without basic medicines, and they face a grim \r\nfuture due to the lack of educational opportunities.\r\nAt the same time, deforestation, exhaustive \r\nexploitation of natural resources, pollution and other \r\nfactors have led to global warming, rising sea levels, \r\nunpredictable weather, natural disasters and new \r\nepidemics. Those grave dangers are driving poorer \r\nnations into deeper destitution.\r\nWe must rally together to escape poverty, fight \r\ndisease, protect the environment, respond to natural \r\ndisasters and build a greener and more just world. \r\nPoor countries and peoples need to lift themselves out \r\nof poverty with the help of wealthier people and more \r\ndeveloped countries. That help must arise not only from \r\na sense of philanthropy — as we say in Viet Nam, whole \r\nleaves wrap torn ones — but above all from a sense of \r\nresponsibility and understanding of our joint destiny. \r\nAfter all, poorer people and nations have contributed \r\nto the wealth of richer nations and people, and they \r\ndeserve a more prosperous future.\r\nI urge the global community to craft, with a sense \r\nof responsibility and humanity, an ambitious post-\r\n2015 development agenda and to redouble our efforts \r\nto promote peace, to end hunger and poverty and to \r\nprotect our planet. Together we can develop a road map \r\nof actions for poorer nations to effectively participate \r\nin international agreements and institutions and to \r\nface and overcome global challenges and dangers in \r\nthe spirit of the motto adopted by Alexandre Dumas’s \r\nmusketeers — “One for all and all for one”.\r\nAs a Vietnamese, what I have shared with the \r\nAssembly comes from experiences soaked in sweat \r\nand blood. Just a few decades ago, the very name “Viet \r\nNam” was synonymous with war, division, blood and \r\ntears. A remote country called Viet Nam suffered \r\n15 million tons of bombs — four times the amount used \r\nin the Second World War. Each Vietnamese bore nearly \r\n10 times his or her weight in bombs, not to mention our \r\npopulation’s suffering from over 70 million litres of the \r\nsilent but deadly Agent Orange/dioxin compound.\r\nAccording to a traditional Vietnamese expression, \r\nbenevolence triumphs over brutality and virtue drives \r\nout tyranny. With courageous sacrifice and creativity \r\nand with the support of peace-loving people, nations \r\nand international organizations, Viet Nam has defended \r\nits independence, united and rebuilt from the ashes of \r\nwar, and left the past behind to become an active and \r\nresponsible member of the international community.\r\n“All men are created equal. They are endowed \r\nby their Creator with certain inalienable rights; \r\namong these are life, liberty and the pursuit of \r\nhappiness”. \r\nAll human life is precious, irrespective of race, religion \r\nor gender. Taking a single life causes heart-breaking \r\npain to any family, be it here in Manhattan or far away \r\nin a remote corner of the Earth. Therefore, any effort \r\nto prevent conflict must be valued and supported. Any \r\neffort to preserve peace must be fully exhausted. Any \r\nact to provoke war must be condemned and stopped. A \r\nphysician must do whatever is possible to cure a patient \r\nif there is but a glimpse of life left. And we must devote \r\nall of our efforts to preserving peace if there is but a \r\nfeeble sign that war can be averted, for war will take the \r\nlife of not only one, but many people, including many \r\nwomen and children.\r\nPeace can be built and preserved only when \r\nall countries respect each other’s independence, \r\nsovereignty and cultural traditions, without imposing \r\none’s own morality on another. Conflict and war can be \r\naverted only if we eliminate actions that run counter to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law, \r\ndominance and power politics. \r\nStrategic trust among nations must be constantly \r\nnurtured with honesty, sincerity and concrete actions. \r\nIn the lifting of the embargo against Cuba or the \r\nrecognition of the right of the Palestinian people to \r\nself-determination, for example, the role of the United \r\nNations and the Security Council should be promoted. \r\nThe international community expects the major Powers \r\nto set an example for others in peacebuilding. The \r\nSecurity Council should be the fulcrum in building \r\nconsensus for driving all nations to join hands in \r\npreserving peace. The deadly hand of war, conflict, \r\nterrorism and violence lies in wait to take the lives \r\nof hundreds, thousands or even millions of innocent \r\npeople. Let us not offer war a hand or look away. Let \r\nus stop it.\r\nI share the Secretary-General’s view that the \r\nMillennium Development Goals are our most successful \r\nendeavour against hunger and poverty to date, but let us \r\nnot forget that close to 40 per cent of global wealth rests \r\nin the hands of no more than 1 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation. The gap between rich and poor continues \r\nto widen. Over 1 billion people still live in extreme \r\npoverty. Hundreds of millions of people, especially \r\nchildren, continue to be hungry and food insecure, \r\n13-48790 25/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nguyen Tan Dung, Prime Minister of the \r\nSocialist Republic of Vietnam, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jiri Rusnok, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Czech Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Jiri Rusnok, Prime Minister of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Jiri \r\nRusnok, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Rusnok (Czech Republic): The Assembly is \r\nmeeting at a time marked by significant challenges. Let \r\nme mention a few which I regard as the most pressing.\r\nThe state of the world economy remains fragile, \r\nbut slowly we seem to be entering a path towards \r\neconomic recovery and, hopefully, sustainable growth. \r\nThe security situation in many parts of the world is \r\nimproving, but we are witnessing many local conflicts \r\nthat endanger the overall regional balance. The conflict \r\nin Syria must come to an end on the basis of a negotiated \r\npolitical settlement. The danger of a nuclear conflict is \r\ndiminishing thanks to the decreasing number of nuclear \r\nwarheads and carriers in the possession of the nuclear \r\nPowers. Yet the currently blocked negotiations with the \r\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons should be a matter of concern. Fundamental \r\nhuman rights and freedoms are still at risk in many \r\ncountries. The gap between the rich and the poor is \r\never widening despite many efforts to alleviate world \r\nhunger and poverty. At the same time, some countries \r\nhave managed to reduce the gap.\r\nInternational cooperation is essential if we want to \r\naddress those and other challenges. The United Nations \r\nremains the most suitable body to pool the global \r\nefforts and resources needed for that task. The world \r\nis changing, and its traditional platform must adapt \r\nas well. From the start, we should formulate realistic \r\nViet Nam has integrated the Millennium Development \r\nGoals into the formulation and implementation of our \r\ndevelopment strategy, and it has balanced economic \r\ndevelopment and social security. We have received a \r\nUnited Nations Food and Agriculture Organization \r\naward for our outstanding achievements in poverty \r\nreduction, Because we consider people the goal \r\nand centre of development, Viet Nam pays special \r\nattention to providing health care, education and the \r\nmeans of communication even for people in remote, \r\nunderdeveloped areas and among our ethnic minorities.\r\nViet Nam is working actively with other members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations community \r\nto build it into a common house for all South-East \r\nAsian nations that were once deeply divided by war. \r\nThat work vividly embodies our aspirations to a bright \r\nfuture of peace, cooperation and prosperity, to unity in \r\ndiversity, and to the accomplishment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nHaving survived devastating wars of aggression \r\nand extreme poverty, our aspirations to peace and \r\nprosperity burn ever more brightly. We are committed \r\nto doing more to participate in peacebuilding, poverty \r\nreduction, environmental protection and other efforts. \r\nWe stand ready to join United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. We are willing to share our resources and \r\nexperience as a tribute to the international friends who \r\nhave supported us in our struggle for independence, \r\nunification and poverty reduction. \r\nViet Nam remains and always will be a reliable \r\npartner and responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity. In the area of food, for example, Viet \r\nNam, a country that has traditionally suffered from \r\nhunger, has become a leading rice exporter. We have \r\nachieved national food security but consider it our \r\nresponsibility to help maintain global food security. \r\nWe not only export, but also help countries to become \r\nself-reliant in food production, as we have done in \r\nCuba, Mozambique, Angola, Mali, Madagascar, \r\nMyanmar and elsewhere. We hope developed countries \r\nand international organizations will participate in \r\nsupporting similar programmes as a meaningful and \r\nsubstantive multiparty model of cooperation.\r\nI am deeply convinced that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda will be created and finalized \r\nfor a world free from war and hunger and devoted to \r\npeace and cooperation, for sustainable development \r\nand prosperity for humankind, and for our evergreen \r\nplanet. Viet Nam commits itself to that purpose.\r\n26/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nThe Czech Republic acknowledges developments \r\nin the transformation process of Myanmar. I strongly \r\nencourage the country’s leaders, in accordance with \r\ntheir public pronouncements, to actively pursue the \r\nprocess of amending the national Constitution in order \r\nto improve democratic standards in the country.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, the role of the United Nations \r\nin resolving armed conflicts is indispensable. United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations are an important \r\ntool for sustainable and durable solutions to violent \r\nconflict worldwide. Having participated in United \r\nNations operations in recent years in relatively small \r\nnumbers, my country, the Czech Republic, is ready \r\nto substantially increase the presence of its military \r\npersonnel in peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe Czech Republic, a non-nuclear-weapon State, \r\nhas always strongly advocated for the unfettered \r\nright to develop, research and use nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes. Nevertheless, that right should be \r\nfully exercised only in conjunction with honouring \r\nall non-proliferation obligations. The long-standing \r\nobjective of the complete elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons may be achieved only if the non-proliferation \r\nregime meets all demands for its strengthening. The \r\nupcoming meeting of the group of governmental experts \r\non a fissile material cut-off treaty will be a step in the \r\nright direction. The Czech Republic greatly appreciates \r\nthat fact that the international community was finally \r\nable to complete the Arms Trade Treaty negotiations.\r\nI should like to share my view of the role of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Czech \r\nRepublic has been actively involved from the very \r\nbeginning in the discussions on the formulation of a \r\nnew development agenda. We are ready and committed \r\nto take part in its implementation. As formulated by the \r\nSecretary-General in his report (A/68/202), the MDGs \r\nhave been the most successful global anti-poverty \r\npush in history and have made a great contribution to \r\nraising public awareness, increasing political will and \r\nmobilizing resources.\r\nSome of the MDG targets have been met already; \r\nsome are within close reach. But the results are uneven \r\namong and within countries and there is a lot of \r\nunfinished business. I can assure the Assembly that \r\nmy Government remains committed to the MDGs, as \r\nreflected in both our policies and our practical actions.\r\nThe future development agenda should build on \r\nthe success of the MDGs and bring together diverse \r\nplans and procedures. However, their implementation \r\nwill not be possible without the necessary political will.\r\nA country’s reputation depends not only on its \r\nsize or economic output, but also on its readiness \r\nto actively engage in addressing and meeting the \r\nchallenges of the current globalized world. The Czech \r\nRepublic, a country with the historical experience of an \r\nundemocratic regime, is ready to share its experience \r\nfrom its democratic transition process, as well as to \r\noffer its help, resources and know-how to countries \r\nundergoing their own democratic transition.\r\nThe year 2013 will mark a turning point for European \r\neconomies. The Czech economy is highly dependent on \r\ninternational trade, and I strongly believe that free and \r\nfair trade is one of the best tools for improving the world \r\neconomic situation. The multilateral approach to trade \r\nissues should be revitalized and cooperation within the \r\nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) reinforced. I sincerely \r\nwish much success to the new WTO leadership.\r\nThe United Nations has always played a key \r\nrole in defusing armed conflicts between and within \r\nthe Member States. Its role in helping to resolve the \r\nconflict in Syria is crucial. The confirmed use of \r\nchemical weapons in Syria is deeply worrying. Any use \r\nof chemical weapons is unacceptable. Whoever gave \r\nthe order to initiate the chemical attack has gravely \r\nviolated the principle of responsibility to protect the \r\ncivilian population. The attack constitutes a war crime \r\nand a crime against humanity, and its perpetrators \r\nshould be held accountable before the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nThe Czech Republic welcomes the decision of \r\nthe Executive Council of the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons on the expeditious \r\ndestruction of Syrian chemical weapons, which is now \r\nbeing adopted in The Hague, and looks forward to the \r\nadoption of a Security Council resolution on the issue \r\nin the coming hours.\r\nThe conflict does not have a military solution; \r\nonly a negotiated political settlement will re-establish \r\npeace in Syria. The Czech Republic calls on all \r\nparties, especially on the Syrian Government, to fully \r\nimplement the 2012 Geneva communiqué (S/2012/523, \r\nannex). The Czech Republic supports and will continue \r\nto support the efforts of the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross to meet \r\nthe growing humanitarian needs in Syria and the \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\n13-48790 27/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nMr. Jiri Rusnok, Prime Minister of the Czech \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Grand \r\nDuchy of Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nThe President of the General Assembly has chosen for \r\nthis session and this general debate the theme “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. He has \r\nthus called on the Assembly to be bold and ambitious, \r\nto work together towards the same objective, to prove to \r\nthe world that we will not accept defeat, and to exert our \r\ncollective responsibility in order to eradicate poverty \r\nand promote sustainable development.\r\nLuxembourg stands ready to do so. We are ready \r\nto work towards a renewed global partnership based \r\non a common understanding of our shared humanity, \r\non a new spirit of solidarity, cooperation and mutual \r\naccountability, and on coordinated action that embraces \r\nsecurity, development, governance, human rights and \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nTo live free from fear, conflict and violence \r\nis the most fundamental human right, and yet we \r\nwitness unspeakable violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law every single day. The \r\nuse of missiles, bombs, cluster munitions and chemical \r\nweapons, the systematic imposition of sieges, forced \r\ndisplacements, torture, sexual violence, violations \r\nand abuses committed against children, more than \r\n2 million refugees, more than 100,000 dead — these \r\nare the chilling results of two and a half years of brutal \r\nrepression and conflict in Syria. The list of war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity committed on a daily \r\nbasis continues to grow. \r\nAgainst such horror, I repeat once again that the \r\nsituation in Syria must be referred to the International \r\nCriminal Court. Allow me to quote High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees António Guterres: \r\n“Syria has become the great tragedy of this \r\ncentury — a disgraceful humanitarian calamity \r\nwith suffering and displacement unparalleled in \r\nrecent history”. \r\nThe Syrian people need assistance now, and they \r\nhave the right to such assistance under the most basic \r\ncriteria codified in international humanitarian law. The \r\nSyrian authorities must urgently meet the demands of \r\ndevelopment actors. I would like to support the single \r\noverarching post-2015 framework, which will link \r\npoverty eradication in all its dimensions and the \r\npromotion of sustainable development. I therefore call \r\nfor the full integration of all relevant international \r\nprocesses, which have been separate until now, in \r\nparticular the review of the MDGs and the work of \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals.\r\nWe have to make sure that the future goals will be \r\nuniversal for all countries but at the same time remain \r\nrealistic, taking into account the actual possibilities of \r\neach country. They must be achievable and measurable. \r\nI appreciate the fact that the report of the High-level \r\nPanel on the Post-2015 Development Agenda puts \r\nemphasis on inclusive growth and considers the role of \r\ninnovation, technology and the private sector actors. \r\nThe proposed development goal to secure sustainable \r\nenergy is a very good example and should figure among \r\nthe future development priorities.\r\nIn December, the international community will \r\ncommemorate the sixty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\nThe situation of human rights has improved in some \r\nareas. New human rights challenges have emerged. \r\nA great deal of work still lies ahead of us. The Czech \r\nRepublic, a member of the Human Rights Council and \r\nthe country of Václav Havel, will always defend human \r\nrights wherever they are violated.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to focus on issues \r\nrelated to the process of reforming the United Nations. \r\nThe Czech Republic appreciates the dedicated work \r\nof the Secretary-General, which is transforming the \r\nUnited Nations into a more effective and accountable \r\nsystem. Unfortunately, there are not enough means to \r\nfund all initiatives. We all have to do more with less. \r\nI am sure that we will find internal reserves that will \r\nallow the United Nations to achieve the tasks entrusted \r\nto it with greater success. By performing well and \r\nby being responsive to its Member States, the United \r\nNations will strengthen the political will of its Members \r\nto invest in multilateral forums and thus contribute to \r\na safer world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Czech Republic for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\n28/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nPalestinians. I also praise the political courage and \r\nthe sense of responsibility shown by the Israeli and \r\nPalestinian authorities in accepting to return to the \r\nnegotiating table. Eight rounds have been held since \r\n14 August. We hope that the negotiations will intensify \r\nin October and lead to a result within the agreed time \r\nframe of nine months.\r\nWe all know that this initiative is probably our last \r\nopportunity to act. We must not let it slip away. If we do, \r\nit could lead to dramatic consequences. The time has \r\ncome to make difficult decisions, to take the necessary \r\nhistoric measures in line with the long-term interests of \r\nthe Israeli and Palestinian peoples. The time has come \r\nto implement the two-State solution. This is no time \r\nfor unilateral acts that fuel the dynamic of mistrust. \r\nBuilding illegal settlements and destroying Palestinian \r\nhomes and infrastructure in the West Bank, including \r\nin East Jerusalem, must stop immediately. The attacks \r\non Gaza must stop. All violence must stop.\r\nWith its partners in the European Union, \r\nLuxembourg stands ready to pursue its active \r\ncontribution to the ongoing efforts, in close cooperation \r\nwith key stakeholders, the Quartet and countries in the \r\nregion. There can be no security in Israel without a \r\nviable Palestinian State. There can be no security in \r\nthe region without peace in all countries of the Middle \r\nEast.\r\nWe must shake up the status quo. We must break \r\nthe cycle of violence. This imperative also applies to \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Great \r\nLakes region. We dearly hope that the Peace, Security \r\nand Cooperation Framework for the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Region, signed on \r\n24 February in Addis Ababa, represents a turning point \r\nfor consolidating peace and regional stability. The \r\nsecond meeting of the Regional Oversight Mechanism, \r\nheld at the level of the Heads of State and Government \r\non Monday in New York City, led to the adoption of \r\nregional benchmarks and indicators on progress, which \r\nwill facilitate the implementation of the Framework. \r\nThis is an important first step. It must be \r\nfollowed by concrete action at the political, security \r\nand economic levels. The parties must fulfil all their \r\ncommitments diligently and in good faith, including a \r\ncommitment neither to tolerate nor to provide assistance \r\nor support of any kind to armed groups, in particular \r\nthe Mouvement du 23 mars, which continues to operate \r\nin the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. We \r\nmust tackle the root causes of recurring violence and \r\nhumanitarian actors by immediately facilitating their \r\nfree and unimpeded access to the affected populations. \r\nIt is urgent to remove bureaucratic obstacles, to \r\nensure the delivery of medical supplies, to institute \r\nhumanitarian pauses, to open up humanitarian routes \r\nand to allow access to populations in need across \r\nborders and across conflict lines.\r\nAs a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, Luxembourg is working with Australia to \r\namplify the demands of humanitarian actors to the \r\nparties to the conflict in Syria and to secure them in a \r\nunified message from the Security Council. I hope that \r\nthose efforts will come to fruition very soon.\r\nWhile we have been able to make progress in \r\npast few days on the issue of chemical weapons, and I \r\nhope we will adopt, a few hours from now a Security \r\nCouncil resolution establishing a strong and binding \r\nmechanism to ensure the control and destruction of \r\nthe Syrian chemical weapons as soon as possible. Yet \r\nwe cannot and must not forget the humanitarian crisis \r\nthat continues to unfold in Syria and its neighbouring \r\ncountries, particularly Lebanon and Jordan but also in \r\nIraq and Turkey. For its part, Luxembourg has fulfiled \r\nthe pledges it made in Kuwait City on 30 January last, \r\nand we have just decided to increase our humanitarian \r\naid to the populations affected by the Syrian crisis to \r\n€7.6 million.\r\nThe vigorous appeal made on Tuesday by the \r\nSecretary-General should resonate with all of us. Let us \r\nbreak our deafening silence and live up to our collective \r\nand individual responsibilities. We all agree that a \r\nlasting solution to the conflict in Syria can only be \r\npolitical. Here too, let us live up to our responsibilities; \r\nlet us seize the momentum created by the agreement \r\non chemical weapons, set a date for the “Geneva II” \r\nconference, and encourage the parties to participate \r\ntherein in order to start down a road, on the basis of \r\nthe Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523, \r\nannex), leading to a cessation of hostilities and to a \r\nnecessary political transition in Syria that meets the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.\r\nTragic as it may be, the situation in Syria must not \r\nlead us to forget the plight of the Palestinian people. \r\nWe must not forget the urgent need to see the creation \r\nof a contiguous and viable Palestinian State, living \r\nin peace and security, side by side with the State of \r\nIsrael. I welcome the commitment and resolve of the \r\nSecretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, \r\nto restart direct negotiations between the Israelis and \r\n13-48790 29/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nillicit transfer, destabilizing accumulation and misuse \r\nof small arms and light weapons on international peace \r\nand security (see S/PV.7036), as well as its adoption of \r\nresolution 2117 (2013). The Council has thereby rightly \r\nunderscored the need for an integrated response from \r\nthe international community that takes into account the \r\nnegative effects of those illicit activities on security, \r\ngovernance, the rule of law and development, as well \r\nas the links between such activities and other threats \r\nto international peace and security such as terrorism, \r\npiracy and transnational organized crime.\r\nThe recent callous attack on a shopping centre \r\nin Nairobi has again demonstrated the importance of \r\nour ongoing vigilance in the fight against terrorism. \r\nThis unacceptable act must encourage us to further \r\nsupport African efforts aimed at freeing Somalia from \r\nthe threat of Al-Shabaab. During the New Deal for \r\nSomalia conference held on 16 September in Brussels, \r\nI had the opportunity to reaffirm that Luxembourg \r\nremained committed to working alongside Somalia. \r\nWe are convinced that with the determined support of \r\nthe international community — the African Union and \r\nthe United Nations in particular, the Government and \r\npeople of Somalia will be able to continue their journey \r\ntowards peace, security and prosperity.\r\nThe risk of the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction remains just as real a threat as the threat of \r\nterrorism. Yesterday, negotiations between the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran and the E3+3 Governments, led by \r\nthe European Union’s High Representative for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Security Policy, Ms. Ashton, resumed here \r\nin New York. We support those efforts. We seek solid \r\nnegotiations quickly leading to concrete outcomes and \r\na diplomatic solution to the Iranian nuclear crisis. \r\nSanctions are not in and of themselves an end. \r\nThey are a global response to Iran’s refusal to meet its \r\ninternational obligations and to cooperate fully with the \r\nInternational Atomatic Energy Agency. We encourage \r\nthe new Iranian leadership to engage in constructive \r\ndialogue, to take the measures necessary to prove to the \r\ninternational community that its nuclear programme is \r\nintended for exclusively peaceful purposes, and to turn \r\na new leaf in its relations with the global community. \r\nI hope that the recent phone call between President \r\nObama and President Rouhani will help move the \r\nsituation in that direction. \r\nWhen we talk about sustainable development and \r\nthe creation of the post-2015 development agenda, we \r\ncannot ignore the devastating effects of conflicts and \r\nlay the foundation for reviving the regional economy \r\nin order to initiate a virtuous circle that will allow the \r\npeople of the region to start down the the path towards \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe commitment of the international community is \r\nall the more necessary in a situation that, regrettably, \r\nhas received far less attention. I am referring to \r\nthe humanitarian tragedy unfolding in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, affecting the entire population of \r\n4.6 million people. Law and order and the rule of law \r\nhave collapsed. Human rights violations have become \r\ncommonplace, as have arbitrary arrests and detention, \r\ntorture, sexual violence against women and children, \r\nrape and extrajudicial executions. According to our \r\nsources, Séléka militias have also recruited and used \r\nat least 3,500 child soldiers. No one can be indifferent \r\nto those figures. The humanitarian situation continues \r\nto deteriorate. The prevailing insecurity has further \r\nreduced access to the affected populations. We must act \r\nimmediately.\r\nRestoring security and law and order must be our \r\nfirst priority. We strongly welcome the decision of the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council to authorize \r\nthe deployment of an international support mission \r\nto the Central African Republic. The United Nations \r\nshould give its full logistical and financial support to \r\nthis African-led mission. Our credibility is at stake.\r\nWe all know the disastrous effects of the unregulated \r\ntrade in conventional arms — violent repression, armed \r\nconflict, crime and widespread violence. That is why \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty is so important. The General \r\nAssembly adopted the Treaty by a very large margin \r\nfive months ago. Luxembourg is proud to have been \r\namong the first sponsors of that important initiative. \r\nWe are proud to have signed the Treaty as soon as it was \r\nready for signature on 3 June. The national ratification \r\nprocedure has started, and members can count on our \r\nsupport to ensure that the Treaty comes rapidly into \r\nfull force. In that regard, allow me to congratulate the \r\nhomeland of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, on having ratified the Treaty. \r\nI also welcome the fact that more than 110 States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, including the United \r\nStates of America, have already signed this new legal \r\ninstrument. \r\nThe Arms Trade Treaty is a significant step forward \r\nfor international law, international humanitarian law \r\nand human rights. In that context, I welcome yesterday’s \r\nimportant Security Council debate on the impact of the \r\n30/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nyear term on the Security Council. That tenure, the first \r\nin our history, is not only an honour but a responsibility \r\nthat we do not take lightly. Each day since 1 January, \r\nLuxembourg has worked in concert with its partners \r\nto contribute to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and to assume our common responsibility \r\nto prevent, to preserve and to protect. No task is more \r\nnoble. No task is more urgent in the current context.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Evangelos Venizelos, the Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nHellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Venizelos (Greece) (spoke in French): I \r\ncongratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. \r\nI convey my deep gratitude and appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his work to strengthen the \r\nrole and effectiveness of the United Nations, fully \r\nsupporting the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nI take this opportunity to emphasize my country’s \r\nalignment with the positions of the European Union, \r\npresented by the President of the European Council, \r\nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, in his address (see \r\nA/68/PV.8).\r\nGreece remains fully committed to the objectives \r\nof the United Nations, whose universal ideals have \r\nnever ceased to inspire us. We are deeply committed \r\nto our collective work for sustainable peace, prosperity \r\nand safeguarding human dignity. In that spirit, we lend \r\nour full support to the efforts to reform and strengthen \r\nthe Organization in order to meet the challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nWe welcome the special event on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the High-Level \r\nPolitical Forum that took place this week and highlighted \r\nthe broad themes of international development and \r\ncooperation. \r\nThe effective management of migration can have \r\na positive impact on the countries of origin and of \r\ndestination. The High-Level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development to be held on 3 and 4 October \r\npresents an important opportunity to develop a global \r\nagenda for the effective and inclusive management of \r\nmigration and to reaffirm the necessary political will. \r\nGreece is committed to participating actively in joint \r\nefforts to that end.\r\nviolence on development. The crisis situations and \r\nthreats that I have just mentioned illustrate this clearly. \r\nWe must also speak firmly about governance that is \r\nconducive to development, institutions that guarantee \r\nthe rule of law, freedom of expression, and transparent \r\nand accountable Governments. We must talk about \r\njustice, the fight against impunity and respect for \r\ninternational law.\r\nLuxembourg fully subscribes to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for the post-2015 objectives to be based \r\non the international norms and principles of human \r\nrights. Those objectives must apply to everybody and \r\nhelp address the global challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, building on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). They must contribute to eliminating \r\npoverty and promoting sustainable development, and \r\nbe integrated into one coherent framework. \r\nThe special event held the day before yesterday \r\nby the General Assembly allowed us to take stock of \r\nongoing work towards achieving the MDGs and to \r\nwelcome significant progress made, but also to identify \r\nthe sectors where it will be important to redouble our \r\nefforts. As the Secretary-General has reminded us, \r\nthe picture before us is only half finished. We must \r\ntherefore speed up the march towards attaining the \r\nMDGs. We must renew our commitment. We must keep \r\nour promises.\r\nMy country will continue to do its part. Since 2009, \r\nour official development assistance has amounted \r\nto 1 per cent of our gross national income. We are \r\ndetermined to maintain this effort despite the crisis. \r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in June 2012, we reaffirmed our \r\ncommitment to sustainable development in its three \r\ninterdependent dimensions: economic development, \r\nsocial inclusion and environmental sustainability. We \r\nreiterated our determination to address the threats that \r\nclimate change and environmental degradation pose to \r\nhumankind. With its European partners, Luxembourg \r\nhas made binding commitments to reduce its carbon \r\nemissions and to mitigate the effects of climate change. \r\nWe are resolved to do our all to achieve a universal \r\nclimate agreement in 2015.\r\nLast year in the Hall of the General Assembly, \r\nour Head of State, the Grand Duke, underscored \r\nLuxembourg’s willingness to serve the United Nations \r\n(see A/67/PV.9). Today, I take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe Assembly for having elected my country to a two-\r\n13-48790 31/32\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.16\r\nof Syria’s chemical arsenal. We welcome the diplomatic \r\nbreakthrough expected to be achieved by the Security \r\nCouncil on the destruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. \r\nIt is our fervent hope that it will be a crucial turning \r\npoint in the Syrian crisis, providing vital momentum \r\ntowards a “Geneva II”-type process that can take us to \r\na viable and inclusive political resolution of the Syrian \r\ncrisis.\r\nGreece has always been a firm supporter of a \r\nEuropean future for the Balkan region. The process \r\nof European integration means leaving behind old, \r\ndivisive mentalities and moving towards an era of close \r\ncooperation, on the basis of shared values and principles. \r\nDemonstrating political courage, Belgrade and Pristina \r\nconcluded an historic agreement in April, which is a \r\nmajor development towards consolidating peace and \r\nstability in the Western Balkans and advancing the \r\nEuropean integration of both sides.\r\nWe seek to develop our relations with the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia on the basis of the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nwithin the framework of good neighbourly relations. \r\nGreece is committed to the ongoing United Nations-\r\nled negotiation process and to finding a solution on \r\nthe issue of a name. We therefore continue our efforts \r\nto reach a mutually acceptable name for all uses, erga \r\nomnes, that will leave no grey areas and allow for a clear \r\ndistinction between our neighbouring country and the \r\nregion of Macedonia in northern Greece. The solution \r\nof the name issue will enable both Greece and its \r\nneighbour to develop multidimensional and productive \r\ncooperation at the bilateral and regional levels. It will \r\nalso contribute to the stability and prosperity of South-\r\nEast Europe and boost the country’s Euro-Atlantic \r\naspirations.\r\nThirty-nine years after the Turkish military invasion \r\nof the island, the Cyprus problem remains first and \r\nforemost an issue of illegal military occupation of well \r\nover one third of the territory of a Member State of the \r\nUnited Nations and European Union. A comprehensive \r\nagreed settlement of that major international problem is \r\na top priority for the foreign policy of Greece. In that \r\ncontext, Greece greatly values the Secretary-General’s \r\nmission of good offices, in particular his ongoing efforts \r\nto successfully relaunch the intercommunal negotiating \r\nprocess. We also fully support President Anastasiadis’ \r\nrenewed constructive package proposal.\r\nWe hope that Ankara will decide at long last to \r\npursue a new policy of normalization of its relations \r\nGreece and the other countries of southern Europe \r\nare under great pressure with regard to the issue of illegal \r\nimmigration, which weighs heavily on our financial and \r\nadministrative capacities. The effective management \r\nof migration represents for our country a key political \r\noption in that it relates directly to safeguarding and \r\nrespecting human rights, social cohesion and public \r\nsecurity, and to maintaining the economic stability \r\nof our countries. On the basis of our experience of \r\nrecent years, we have reviewed our national action \r\nplan to reform the system of asylum and immigration. \r\nFurthermore, migration and mobility issues will be \r\namong the priorities of the Greek presidency of the \r\nEuropean Council in the first term of 2014.\r\nThe promotion of human rights is a priority interest. \r\nGreece will lend its full support to strengthening the \r\nHuman Rights Council with a solid mandate. Greece is \r\ndetermined to contribute actively to the mission of the \r\nHuman Rights Council and is presenting its candidature \r\nfor the 2017–2019 term. Greece is strongly devoted to \r\nthe decisive role of the United Nations in peace and \r\nsecurity. In spite of financial restraints, we remain \r\nfirmly committed to peacekeeping operations, to which \r\nwe contribute personnel and resources, including to the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. We support \r\nefforts to prevent conflicts and promote the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. Moreover, we attach particular \r\nimportance to cooperation between the European \r\nUnion and the United Nations in the field of crisis \r\nmanagement, and we welcome the work undertaken to \r\nfurther strengthen that cooperation.\r\n(spoke in English) \r\nThe relaunching of peace negotiations between \r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority, facilitated by the \r\nUnited States, provides an important opportunity to \r\nreach a final settlement to this long-standing problem, \r\nto the benefit and stability in the wider region, based \r\non a two-State solution with a secure Israel and a \r\nsovereign, contiguous and viable Palestine living side \r\nby side. Prime Minister Netanyahu and President \r\nAbbas must be praised for their leadership and courage \r\nto engage in the peace talks. Now is the time to take \r\nbold and concrete steps towards peace.\r\nGreece is very concerned with the ongoing \r\ncrisis in Syria, which jeopardizes stability in a very \r\nfragile region. Greece and the European Union have \r\nunequivocally condemned the use of chemical weapons, \r\nand we strongly support the United States-Russian \r\nFederation initiative for the collection and destruction \r\n32/32 13-48790\r\nA/68/PV.16 27/09/2013\r\nnecessary structural reforms in public administration, \r\nthe investment sector and the labour market, and our \r\nprivatization programme is already yielding results. But \r\nall of that has, of course, come through great sacrifices \r\nborne by the Greek people and at a very high social \r\nand political cost. Defending democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw against forms of racist, xenophobic conduct and all \r\nforms of social violence is a fundamental engagement \r\nof the Hellenic Republic.\r\nI also wish to say a few words about the priorities \r\nof Greece’s upcoming presidency of the Council of the \r\nEuropean Union in the first half of 2014. Coming at \r\na time of unprecedented economic challenges for the \r\nUnion, our presidency will carry forward the vital \r\ndebate on the future of Europe — a debate that will \r\nintensify as we approach next year’s European elections.\r\nAll the issues that humankind is facing and that are \r\nbeing dealt with by General Assembly at this session \r\nhighlight the need to enhance the role of the United \r\nNations and to further consolidate the institutions of \r\nglobal economic and political governance. The hopes of \r\nthe international community are oriented towards the \r\nUnited Nations. Our Organization has to send a strong \r\nand clear message of peace, security and prosperity \r\nto the peoples of the world, particularly the younger \r\ngeneration.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.25 p.m.\r\nwith the Republic of Cyprus. Such a Turkish policy \r\nwould decisively facilitate the relaunching of \r\nintercommunal negotiations on a just and viable \r\nsolution to the Cyprus issue within the framework of \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, in line with \r\nthe acquis communautaire and approved by the Cypriot \r\npeople through a referendum. The new developments \r\nin the energy sector regarding the exploitation of \r\nhydrocarbons can serve as a factor for development, \r\npeace and stability throughout the region.\r\nRelations with our neighbour Turkey are set on \r\na positive course. Institutionalized cooperation at \r\nthe highest governmental level, as well as increasing \r\ntourism and economic cooperation, can create further \r\npotential for the future. Nevertheless, critical factors \r\nneeded to promote substantial and promising prospects \r\nfor our relationship with our eastern neighbour are full \r\nrespect for international law and international legality \r\nand, within this framework, a just and viable solution \r\nto the Cyprus issue.\r\nThe Greek people have succeeded in restoring \r\nthe country’s credibility. Greece has already \r\nachieved the highest structural primary surplus in the \r\nEurozone — 5 per cent of gross domestic product. Greece \r\nhas achieved a peacetime historical first — a fiscal \r\nadjustment of 19 per cent of gross domestic product \r\nin the four years from 2009 to 2013. We have done so \r\nin spite of six years of recession. We have carried out \r\n"
