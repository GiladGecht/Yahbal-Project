"In the absence of the President, Mr. Touré (Guinea), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.25 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Bazoum, Minister \r\nof State for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, African \r\nIntegration and Nigeriens Abroad of the Republic of \r\nthe Niger.\r\nMr. Bazoum (Niger) (spoke in French): It is a great \r\nhonour for me to take the f loor at the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, which is being held in \r\nthe context of some rather disturbing developments in \r\nterms of peace and security — developments that, very \r\nappropriately, we have an opportunity to consider and \r\nto deal with under the provisions of the United Nations \r\nCharter.\r\nAs I begin my statement I should like to congratulate \r\nMr. John Ashe on his election to the presidency, without \r\nforgetting the team that is helping him. I should also \r\nlike to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ntireless efforts in areas such as sustainable development, \r\npeace, security and counter-terrorism, particularly in \r\nour region of the Sahel.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe theme of the sixty-eighth session, “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, leads us \r\nto ask what measures to take, in the spirit of solidarity, \r\nonce we have established that many countries will not \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals within the \r\ntime frame, as is the case with my country, the Niger. \r\nThis session of the General Assembly gives me an \r\nopportunity to review the ongoing efforts in our country \r\nin that area. The renaissance programme established \r\nsince President Mahamadou Issoufou was elected to head \r\nour country makes agriculture, health and education \r\nabsolute priorities, so that we can substantially improve \r\nour human development index performance. Resources \r\nexpended for that purpose have enabled our country \r\nto make significant progress. We have, in particular, \r\nreduced the proportion of the population living in \r\nextreme poverty and chronic undernourishment. I \r\nshould like to welcome the significant assistance from \r\nbilateral partners and from international organizations, \r\nincluding non-governmental organizations, which are \r\nassisting the Government of the Niger in its policies \r\nand programmes for a harmonious socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. It is for that purpose that the Government \r\nlaunched an ambitious socioeconomic development \r\nprogramme. A round table of donors was held last \r\nNovember in Paris, at which pledges totalling more than \r\n$4.8 billion were announced. That amount exceeded \r\nthe expectations of my Government.\r\nWe call for the effective mobilization of those \r\ncommitments, so that we can take action in five \r\nstrategic areas:, namely, building the credibility \r\nand effectiveness of public institutions; establishing \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.17\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n17th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 27 September 2013, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That \r\nmobilization was driven by the Economic Community \r\nof West African States (ECOWAS), which dedicated a \r\nnumber of very high-level meetings to the subject of \r\nMali, and was effectively relayed by the African Union \r\nthrough its Peace and Security Council. It was followed \r\nup on a regular basis by the United Nations, whose \r\nSecurity Council has adopted many resolutions on the \r\nsubject.\r\nBut today, as we take stock of that joint action, we \r\nare duty-bound to recognize that we owe the health \r\nof Mali more especially to the far-sighted decision of \r\nPresident Hollande to launch Operation Serval, which \r\nwas able to put an end to the terrorist coalition in early \r\nJanuary 2013, thanks to the sizeable means put at its \r\ndisposal, making it equal to the task.We must recognize \r\nalso that, while ECOWAS rightly and promptly opted \r\nfor a military intervention, most of the States that were \r\nsupposed to mobilize troop contingents were slow \r\nto make them available and operational. The United \r\nNations, for its part, sought to differentiate between \r\nterrorist organizations, so that, against all the evidence, \r\nit could promote a dialogue with some of them. We \r\nwho were facing the threat were made very anxious by \r\nsome of the debates at the United Nations, which could \r\nhave been avoided if only the facts had been faced and \r\nthe straightforwardness of the evidence noted. The \r\nunjustified stalling by the international community \r\nencouraged the terrorists to press their advantage by \r\nadopting a new agenda and new goals, enabling them to \r\nenvisage total victory over Malian territory, and even \r\nbeyond.\r\nIf I dwell on this it is, first, because I know how \r\nclose we came to disaster, and, secondly, because it is \r\nmy deep conviction that just because our enterprise \r\nis complex it does not necessarily mean that we are \r\ndoomed to inaction at best and to mistakes at worst.\r\nIn spite of what I have just said, the action of the \r\ninternational community in Mali yielded very positive \r\nresults, thanks to the support of all. Mali, in addition \r\nto being free, on 11 August chose its President in \r\nan election that was in every respect remarkable. I \r\nshould like to extend once again my congratulations to \r\nPresident Keita.\r\nThe international community should continue \r\nto support Mali, adding to the troops and capacity of \r\nconditions for sustainable, balanced and inclusive \r\ndevelopment; food security and sustainable agricultural \r\ndevelopment; a competitive and diversified economy \r\ndesigned to promote accelerated and inclusive growth; \r\nand the promotion of social development.\r\nGiven the particular interest accorded to rural \r\npopulations by our President, we have developed \r\nand launched the “three N’s” initiative — Nigeriens \r\nfeeding Nigeriens — with the goal of promoting \r\nfood security and food sovereignty, in order to end \r\nthe food shortages caused by recurring droughts. \r\nThe programme is intended to improve agricultural \r\nproductivity by promoting irrigation through the \r\njudicious development of the substantial water potential \r\nof our country, by improving production techniques \r\nthrough the substantial use of inputs and machinery, \r\nby reorganizing the farming sector, by rationalizing \r\ndistribution channels for agricultural products and by \r\nbuilding roads in rural areas.\r\nAlways bearing in mind the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, our Government is paying \r\nparticular attention to the vital question of education, \r\nincluding the construction of schools, the delivery of \r\nschool supplies, the extensive recruitment of teachers \r\nand the improvement of teachers’ working conditions. \r\nIt is determined, too, to pursue a bold, consciousness-\r\nraising policy aimed at controlling population growth, \r\nwhich is currently negating the impact of the remarkable \r\neconomic growth that we have experienced in the past \r\ntwo years.\r\nAs I said at the beginning of my statement, this \r\nsession is taking place at a time when the purpose and \r\nrole of the Organization are being sorely tested, owing \r\nto an international situation characterized by persisting \r\nor new crises and conflicts. Now more than ever, we \r\nneed to rise to the challenge, bearing in mind the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nWe call upon the General Assembly, and in \r\nparticular the Security Council, to continue to work \r\nresolutely to arrive at negotiated and lasting solutions \r\nto situations where lethal crises have the potential to \r\ncause desolation and displacement and compromise \r\nsocioeconomic development. \r\nFor us in the Sahel the major concern in 2012 and \r\n2013 has been Mali. The Niger is pleased with the \r\npositive outcome in that country and the follow-up \r\nmachinery put in place by the Organization through \r\n13-48796 3/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nchemical weapons, as occurred on 21 August, and call \r\nupon the United Nations to reach a political solution at \r\nthe upcoming “Geneva II” conference.\r\nFor a number of decades now, the Cuban population \r\nhas endured a trade, economic and financial embargo. \r\nWe call for the lifting of that embargo.\r\nIn conclusion, I express my fervent hope that our \r\ndeliberations will help advance the cause of peace, \r\nsecurity and progress throughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I call now \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ali Ahmed Karti, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of the Sudan. \r\nMr. Karti (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Today, I \r\naddress the Assembly at a time when I feel great \r\nuncertainty about the future of the Organization and \r\nthe established rules governing the relations among \r\nits Member States. It was expected that yesterday the \r\nAssembly would hear, from this rostrum, a statement \r\nfrom President Al-Bashir, the elected President of the \r\nRepublic of the Sudan. However, with deep regret I \r\nmust report the refusal by the authorities of the United \r\nStates, the host Government, to give entry visas to \r\nPresident Al-Bashir and his delegation, thus rendering \r\nhim unable to participate in the work of the Assembly \r\nat this session. \r\nThe fact that the authorities of the host country did \r\nnot grant a visa to our President is a serious violation \r\nof the principles and purposes set forth in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. Specifically, it is a violation of \r\nthe Headquarters Agreement signed in December 1946 \r\nwith the host country. \r\nPresident Al-Bashir is known throughout Africa. \r\nHe is known by all those who hold peace dear. He is \r\nknown by everybody for what he has done — putting \r\nan end to the longest bloodthirsty civil war in Africa, \r\ninherited from the days of colonialism. The birth \r\nof the Republic of South Sudan is clear proof of his \r\ncommitment to the implementation of the provisions of \r\nthe Comprehensive Peace Agreement. \r\nDespite the tremendous sacrifice made by giving \r\nup a valuable part of the territory, one rich in natural \r\nand human resources, President Al-Bashir has been \r\nprevented from participating in the work of the General \r\nAssembly. However, the meeting of the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council of the African Union has highlighted \r\nthe part that he has played in supporting peace between \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan and throughout our region.\r\nMINUSMA, so that it can complete the job of eradicating \r\nthe terrorist groups. These are now in difficult straits, \r\nbut are far from having, as it were, uttered their final \r\nword.\r\nIt is also urgent to put in place regional and \r\ninternational coordination, the job of which would be \r\nto provide security for all of the Sahelo-Saharan area. \r\nVigorous measures of a general nature need to be taken \r\nagainst drug trafficking and cross-border organized \r\ncrime. In that regard, I wish to express my sympathy \r\nfor the plight of the hostages held by terrorists in the \r\nSahelo-Saharan area. I convey my condolences to \r\ntheir families and call for more efforts to achieve their \r\nprompt release.\r\nThe problems of the Sahel are not just security \r\nproblems. That part of the world is among the most \r\naff licted. It is subject to the effects of climate change, \r\ndesertification and recurring droughts, as well as \r\nthe resulting food shortages and malnutrition. It \r\nneeds significant investment as part of a sustained \r\nglobal strategy, supported by the entire international \r\ncommunity, to ensure the economic progress that is \r\nvital for its stabilization and its deliverance from the \r\nclutches of violence.\r\nTerrorism in Africa affects not only the Sahel, but \r\nalso the Horn of Africa. It struck the Kenyan people on \r\n23 September in the form of the bloody and murderous \r\nattack on the Westgate Mall in Nairobi. I should like to \r\ntake this opportunity to express my condolences to the \r\nGovernment of Kenya.\r\nThe populations in the Central African Republic \r\nare, tragically, experiencing an unprecedented level \r\nof violence. The Niger calls for an international \r\nintervention, as in Mali in January 2013, to put an end \r\nto the martyrdom of the people of the Central African \r\nRepublic.\r\nWith respect to Palestine, it is heartbreaking to \r\nthink that in today’s world, so characterized by highly \r\nsophisticated technology and so imbued with modern \r\nvalues, a people could be deprived of its most elementary \r\nrights. The Niger is hopeful that the current initiative of \r\nthe United States Government will be successful and \r\nwill lead to the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian \r\nState beside and in harmonious coexistence with Israel.\r\nWhat is happening in Syria is a veritable tragedy, \r\neven in this topsy-turvy world. A millennial civilization \r\nis crumbling before our eyes. We condemn the use of \r\n4/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nwill be dealt with in our policy. We are committed to \r\nthe principles of human rights, and we have set up an \r\nindependent national human rights commission in the \r\nSudan, founded in accordance with the Paris principles, \r\nthat cooperates with the relevant United Nations \r\nagencies.\r\nTo promote and strengthen human rights, we \r\nsigned a national law to combat trafficking in human \r\nbeings. We have many specialized institutions and \r\nmechanisms that work to defend women’s rights \r\nas well, so that women can participate fully in our \r\nsociety and in our State. That can be seen very clearly \r\nin the positive discrimination we have been pursuing \r\nvis-à-vis women, which has led to greater political \r\nparticipation by women at the legislative, executive and \r\nother decision-making levels.\r\nIn 2010 we adopted a law on the rights of the \r\nchild that is in accordance with the principles of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional \r\nProtocols, so that we can promote the rights of \r\nchildren and protect them against any kind of violence \r\nor exploitation. Our various national institutions \r\ncoordinate among themselves, and we have set up a \r\nnational board for children. We have police who deal \r\nespecially with the issues of youth and children, and we \r\nhave a public prosecutor who specializes in this area.\r\nOnce South Sudan was established, we immediately \r\nbegan to engage in neighbourly and fruitful cooperation \r\nwith it. We have blood ties with it and a common border \r\nmore than 2,100 kilometres long. About two thirds of \r\nthe inhabitants of both countries live along the borders. \r\nThe period following the independence of South \r\nSudan was a period of some tension because of \r\ncertain matters that had been left pending, so the two \r\ncountries entered into very intensive negotiations. On \r\n27 September 2012, exactly one year ago, in Addis Ababa \r\nthe two countries were able to sign nine agreements \r\ncovering all matters of cooperation between our two \r\ncountries. We included mechanisms for implementing \r\nthe agreements in an accompanying document. We also \r\nset forth deadlines for reaching further agreements. \r\nAt the most recent negotiating session between the \r\ntwo Presidents, in Khartoum on 3 September, and in \r\nthe presence of Mr. Mbeki, the two Presidents came to \r\nan agreement on how to deal with all pending matters. \r\nThey also appealed to the international community \r\nto cancel the Sudan’s debt and to lift the sanctions \r\nimposed on it. \r\nMy delegation would like to say that this unjustified \r\nand unacceptable action sets a very serious precedent \r\nin the history of the United Nations. It requires that the \r\nwhole membership take a firm position on this matter. \r\nThis denial of the legitimate right of a Member State \r\nleads us to call on the Secretary-General to exercise his \r\nduty and responsibility to protect the rights of Member \r\nStates under the Headquarters Agreement. If the matter \r\nwere left up to the Sudan, then the same kind of thing \r\ncould happen to any other Member State, and we would \r\nnot like those rights to be violated. \r\nI should like to warmly congratulate the President on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. I take this opportunity to \r\nextend my country’s thanks to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić, for the excellent manner in which he guided \r\nthe work at the last session. We also thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and his team in the Secretariat \r\nfor the sincere and diligent work that they have done \r\nfor us.\r\nIt is our hope that discussions during this session \r\nwill be successful. The theme chosen, “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is \r\nimportant. The Sudan believes that the Organization \r\nand its specialized agencies will indeed devote the \r\nimportance that is appropriate to such a crucial issue \r\nbecause development is essential to international peace \r\nand security, particularly in developing countries. As \r\neveryone knows, poverty, underdevelopment, climate \r\nchange and a shortage of resources are some of the \r\nmain causes of conflict in the world.\r\nThe Sudan has made great strategic progress \r\nregarding peace, stability and prosperity for its people \r\nand has begun a political process that will lead to the \r\nadoption of a final constitution. After the peace efforts \r\nproved successful vis-à-vis the independence of South \r\nSudan, we accepted the choice of its people. Today \r\nwe are working to develop a solid economic system, \r\neven though we have to deal with the after-effects of \r\neconomic sanctions that the United States unilaterally \r\nimposed on us. We have begun to take economic steps \r\nnecessary to strengthen our economy and prevent it \r\nfrom collapsing. \r\nOn the matter of human rights, I should like to share \r\nthe opinion expressed by the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nSudan. He recognized that progress had been made in \r\nvarious areas of human rights. These matters have been \r\ndealt with very seriously, and the recommendations \r\n13-48796 5/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nlike to work with others through the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nThe situation is deteriorating every year. We have \r\nsuffered from climate change since the mid-1980s. \r\nWe have suffered from recurrent cycles of drought in \r\nmuch of our territory, and that has also been a factor \r\nin slowing down our development goals. It has also \r\ncreated instability in many parts of our country because \r\nof conflict over pasture land and water supplies. That \r\napplies also in Darfur, where historically there have \r\nbeen tribal disputes and disputes over pastureland \r\nbecause of long periods of drought. The Darfur \r\nconflict became a political issue only in the last decade \r\nbecause of external interference. There is a very close \r\nrelationship between climate change and armed conflict \r\nin that respect.\r\nMy country attaches paramount importance to the \r\nrule of law at the national and international levels. We \r\nmake sure that our national laws and our legislature are \r\nin accordance with international instruments, laws and \r\ntreaties to which we are a party. So from this rostrum, \r\nand based on our own experience, we reiterate our \r\nrejection of the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nOver the past decade or so it has been violating the \r\nprinciples of international law and justice. The ICC \r\nhas been used as a political tool by certain parties in \r\nthe international arena. Many of those that signed the \r\nRome Statute have now become aware of the negative \r\nimpact of the ICC and its destructive impact on stability \r\nand peace. The last African Union Summit showed that \r\nvery clearly.\r\nRegarding the crisis in Syria, our position has \r\nalways been clear. We call for peaceful dialogue among \r\nthe Syrians themselves towards identifying a peaceful \r\nand permanent solution. We have always rejected \r\nviolence and foreign interference. We condemn the use \r\nof chemical weapons in the Syrian conflict, and we \r\nsupport the Russian approach to resolving this matter.\r\nThe question of Palestine — how to achieve justice \r\nand restore the rights of the Palestinian people and stop \r\nthe illegal aggression by the Israeli authorities in that \r\nterritory — is still a real challenge in the international \r\narena. The prisoners must be released. The matter \r\nmust be resolved within the context of international \r\nlegitimacy and the Arab Peace Initiative, but Israel has \r\nsimply turned a deaf ear to proposals from the Arab \r\nsides. \r\nTurning now to the matter of unilateral sanctions, \r\nit is our hope that we will have strong and healthy \r\nrelations with South Sudan, and we will spare no effort \r\nto achieve that. We trust the international community \r\nwill be supportive of our efforts. We would like to \r\nextend our thanks to the African high-level mechanism \r\nand the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in this connection. \r\nI am happy to be able to report that the efforts of \r\nthe Government of the Sudan and the international \r\ncommunity vis-à-vis Darfur have made possible real \r\nand continuous progress in terms of stability and \r\nsecurity. There has been a sharp drop in the violence \r\nthere because those that signed the Doha peace \r\nagreement have lived up to their promises. Many of the \r\narmed groups joined the agreement later. The voluntary \r\nreturn of people who had left is also being organized \r\nand services are being provided.\r\nI should like to say that relations between the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan and United Nations bodies \r\nwith regard to the humanitarian situation are now stable, \r\nso that humanitarian needs can be met. We reached \r\nan agreement with UNICEF on vaccinations against \r\npoliomyelitis and other diseases, and an agreement was \r\nreached as part of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement.\r\nRegarding non-governmental organizations, the \r\nSudan, like other Member States, is committed to the \r\nimplementation of the development goals, including \r\ncombating poverty. We have adopted policies on \r\nreducing poverty and on providing more jobs for young \r\ngraduates. We are also developing a microfinance system \r\nfor low- and middle-income people. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, unemployment is not as low as we had hoped, \r\nand the unilateral economic sanctions have been a real \r\nobstacle to our making progress in development and \r\nin strengthening our economy. It has been particularly \r\ndifficult for young people in the Sudan, who account \r\nfor about 60 per cent of our population. \r\nThe Sudan calls on the international community \r\nto live up to its promise to cancel the debt and to lift \r\nunilateral economic sanctions. The matter of the debt is \r\none of the important goals of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Debt is a real burden for so many countries in \r\nthe world.\r\nThe Sudan is a prominent member of many \r\ninternational bodies dealing with the environment. As a \r\nvictim of climate change, the Sudan believes that great \r\nattention should be paid to environmental issues and \r\ngoals in the post-2015 development agenda. We would \r\n6/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nare now witnessing regression. Some Asian States are \r\nfacing similar risks of destabilization. The number of \r\npost-conflict countries is also on the rise, inevitably \r\naffecting global development in an interconnected \r\nworld. Never before has the need been more compelling \r\nfor equal partnership and the participation of all \r\nMember States, based on mutual respect and norms as \r\nembodied in the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law. The United Nations, by \r\nthe power invested in it by its Member States, stands out \r\nas our unquestioned leading entity on the world stage.\r\nKazakhstan strongly condemns the use of chemical \r\nweapons in Syria, as confirmed by the findings of \r\nan independent investigation by the United Nations \r\nmission, and regards it as a crime against humanity. We \r\nsupport the adoption of a Security Council resolution \r\non Syria that would stipulate strict compliance with \r\na concerted decision on the elimination of chemical \r\nweapons in that country and the conduct of regular \r\ninspections of that process.\r\nWe express our hope that the accession of Syria to \r\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \r\nand on Their Destruction, as well as the placement of \r\nsuch weapons under international control, will preclude \r\nthe possibility of their repeated use and will contribute \r\ntowards the end of the long-standing and bloody conflict \r\nin Syria. We call for the earliest possible convening \r\nof an international conference on the settlement of \r\nthat conflict, with the aim of ending the violence and \r\ndetermining Syria’s political future through dialogue \r\nand reconciliation.\r\nThe current situation in the nuclear disarmament \r\nprocess also does not encourage confidence in a more \r\npeaceful future. While we participated actively in \r\nyesterday’s High-level Meeting, we stress once again \r\nnow from the rostrum of the General Assembly that our \r\ncountry has a special moral authority to champion the \r\ncause of nuclear abolition. By closing the Semipalatinsk \r\nnuclear test site soon after our independence in 1991 \r\nand renouncing the fourth-largest nuclear arsenal, \r\nKazakhstan made a unique contribution in the \r\nmultilateral effort to achieve a world free of nuclear \r\nweapons.\r\nWe believe that the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which remains the \r\ncornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, must reach \r\nfull universalization, with the strict implementation \r\nof national obligations in accordance with the three \r\nThere has been a constant call for respect for \r\ninternational law. The reform of the United Nations \r\nand its principal and subsidiary organs is a matter of \r\nsome urgency and importance. It is time for a practical \r\nprocess to start, with a clear work programme, so that \r\nthe international system can act in a manner that is \r\nfair, transparent and effective, so that it can take up \r\nthe challenges it faces. But no progress will be made in \r\nreform until the General Assembly can play its full part \r\nand exercise all of its powers without any intimidation \r\nfrom the Security Council. \r\nThe matter of reform of the Security Council \r\nis also of some importance for the Sudan, because \r\nthat will mean that there is real reform in the United \r\nNations. The Security Council today does not reflect \r\nthe realities of the world. It adopts resolutions and takes \r\ndecisions but not in a democratic and transparent way. \r\nIt is therefore essential that there be comprehensive \r\nreform. Partial or transitional reforms are not possible. \r\nWe support the African Union position on reform of the \r\ninternational system. We want a balanced, pluralistic \r\nand fairer system that will be able to deal with the \r\nchallenges of the world of today, ensure respect for \r\ninternational law and for the noble principles of the \r\nOrganization and attain the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter — respect for the sovereignty of States and \r\nnon-interference in domestic issues under any pretext \r\nwhatsoever; the non-use of force; and the non-use of the \r\nthreat of force against others.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Erlan Idrissov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Idrissov (Kazakhstan): On behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, I should like first to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on his \r\nelection as the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-eighth session and to wish him every success in \r\nhis important functions. I should also like to take this \r\nopportunity to express our profound gratitude to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his able \r\nstewardship, energy and dedication in finding solutions \r\nto critical international challenges.\r\nSince we met here at the United Nations a year \r\nago the world situation has not improved but, on the \r\ncontrary, has deteriorated, becoming more fragile and \r\nvulnerable to new risks and threats. A growing number \r\nof States in the Middle East and Africa, which were \r\nmaking steady progress, both economically and socially, \r\n13-48796 7/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nensure progress in the dialogue between the group \r\nof international mediators and Iran, Kazakhstan \r\nhosted two rounds of negotiations in Almaty this \r\nyear. Specific agreements have yet to be reached, but \r\nwe are confident that a mutually acceptable outcome \r\nis possible. We believe that concrete actions by Iran \r\nto ensure the transparency and peaceful nature of its \r\nnuclear programme, along with reciprocal constructive \r\nsteps on the part of the group of six, will advance \r\nthe settlement of the problem, rather than relying on \r\nsanctions alone. We all witnessed the latest positive \r\nsigns of understanding on that issue during the current \r\nsession and wholeheartedly welcomed them, remaining \r\nfully available to contribute to a productive negotiation \r\nprocess.\r\nWe express our grave concern about North Korea’s \r\nnuclear programme. Attempts to engage in the secret \r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons in violation of \r\ninternational obligations cannot be justified under \r\nany circumstances. At the same time, Kazakhstan is \r\nagainst a military solution to the problem, since we \r\nare convinced that only the peaceful settlement of that \r\ncrisis, within the framework of the Six-Party Talks, can \r\nensure peace and stability in North-East Asia. \r\nKazakhstan is genuinely interested in the \r\nsustainable and stable development of Afghanistan \r\nthrough its transformation into a politically stable and \r\neconomically viable State in keeping with the decisions \r\nof the ministerial conference of the Istanbul Process held \r\nin Almaty last April. We support the rapid integration \r\nof Afghanistan into the regional framework so as to \r\npromote its speedy social and economic recovery.\r\nThe Asian continent is transforming itself into a \r\nglobal powerhouse for the twenty-first century, with \r\nits production of more than 57 per cent of global \r\ngross domestic product — a trend that is expected to \r\nincrease. However, that growth could be jeopardized by \r\nan aggravation of existing conflicts, illegal migration, \r\ndrug trafficking, territorial claims, separatism, \r\nreligious extremism and terrorism. To cope with those \r\nchallenges, Asia needs a regional security architecture. \r\nKazakhstan, as the host of the Conference on Interaction \r\nand Confidence-building Measures in Asia, is striving \r\nto maximize opportunities for joint decision-making on \r\nsecurity and cooperation in Asia.\r\nKazakhstan is committed to the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law, among which respect \r\nfor human rights and freedom, based on impartiality \r\nand non-politicization, is deemed pivotal for a \r\nfundamental pillars of the Treaty — non-proliferation, \r\nthe peaceful use of nuclear energy and \r\ndisarmament — in a balanced way. We call on all \r\nnon-NPT countries possessing nuclear weapons to sign \r\nthe Treaty and on all States parties not to withdraw. \r\nThe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-\r\nTest-Ban Treaty (CTBT) should become an important \r\ncatalyst in the non-proliferation process, promoting the \r\neffective implementation of the NPT. We urge those \r\ncountries that have not yet done so to sign and ratify that \r\nimportant document. The General Assembly resolution \r\ninitiated by Kazakhstan establishing 29 August as the \r\nInternational Day against Nuclear Tests (resolution \r\n64/35) matches the goals and objectives for the entry \r\ninto force of the CTBT.\r\nThe Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in \r\nCentral Asia, which came into force in March 2009, \r\nrepresents an important contribution by the Central \r\nAsian countries to international and regional security. \r\nIt is the first nuclear-weapon-free zone established in \r\nthe northern hemisphere and shares common borders \r\nwith two major nuclear Powers. It is also the first such \r\nzone where previously nuclear weapons had existed. \r\nKazakhstan welcomes the willingness of the five \r\npermanent members of the Security Council to hold \r\na dialogue on the Additional Protocol with the five \r\ncountries in the zone and to provide negative assurances \r\nas soon as possible.\r\nKazakhstan supports the early convening of the \r\nconference on the establishment of a Middle East zone \r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction under the auspices \r\nof the United Nations and calls upon all States in the \r\nregion actively to cooperate to make that important \r\nundertaking possible.\r\nIn order to take further decisive actions to eliminate \r\nthe nuclear threat, President Nursultan Nazarbaev of \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan has proposed the adoption \r\nof a universal declaration for a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld, which would be an important step towards a \r\nnuclear-weapons prohibition convention, and thereby \r\nachieving a nuclear-weapon-free world. We count on \r\nMember States to finalize and submit a draft resolution \r\non the universal declaration of the General Assembly at \r\nthis session.\r\nWe support an immediate political and diplomatic \r\nsettlement of the situation concerning the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme on the basis of strict compliance \r\nwith the provisions of the NPT and the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency regulations. In order to \r\n8/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nThe second World Anti-Crisis Conference, which is to \r\nbe held next May in Kazakhstan, will draft the world \r\nanti-crisis plan to combat the financial and economic \r\ncrisis so as to ensure long-term sustainable economic \r\ngrowth.\r\nWe are pleased to note the commendable work of \r\nthe United Nations in implementing the agreements \r\nreached at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment held in Rio de Janeiro (Rio+20), and \r\nKazakhstan is actively contributing to that work. A \r\nnational plan for transitioning to a green economy has \r\nbeen developed, with programmes in key sectors of \r\nthe economy — energy, water, utilities, agriculture, \r\nindustry and biodiversity. Kazakhstan has also initiated \r\nthe transition to a green economy in Central Asia within \r\nthe framework of the regional Intergovernmental \r\nCommission on Sustainable Development. The Rio+20 \r\nConference supported the Kazakhstan-sponsored \r\nGreen Bridge Partnership Programme as a voluntary \r\nframework for mutually beneficial cooperation between \r\nthe developed and developing world in the interests of \r\nsustainable development. Next Monday, 30 September, \r\nKazakhstan will host the International Conference on \r\nthe Green Bridge Partnership Programme in Astana \r\nwith the participation of regional countries, the \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific, the Economic Commission for Europe and \r\nother stakeholders. At that Conference the programme \r\nwill be institutionalized and its secretariat established.\r\nKazakhstan has made voluntary commitments to \r\nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions within the framework \r\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change by reducing carbon dioxide emissions \r\nand investing in low-carbon development, all of which \r\nconstitute Kazakhstan’s contribution to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s global Sustainable Energy for All initiative \r\nand other initiatives aimed at sustainable development.\r\nI am pleased to inform members that Kazakhstan’s \r\ncapital, Astana, will host the international exhibition \r\nEXPO 2017, entitled “Energy for the Future”, which \r\nis designed to disseminate best practices in the \r\nfield of sustainable energy. On the basis of national \r\nconsultations, we have developed a number of \r\nrecommendations on development goals for the post-\r\n2015 agenda and submitted them to the United Nations. \r\nWe believe that those Millennium Development Goals \r\nthat were not reached must be included in the post-\r\n2015 agenda, in conjunction with the objectives of \r\nsustainable development. International partnerships \r\nsustainable, universal and effective global architecture \r\nfor protecting human rights. That, among other things, \r\nrequires appropriate budgeting and the strengthening of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and its special procedures, \r\nin particular the universal periodic review and the \r\ninstitution of special rapporteurs, as well as supporting \r\nthe capacity and authority of United Nations human \r\nrights mechanisms.\r\nWe need to implement civil, political, economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights at the national, regional \r\nand global levels while paying particular attention \r\nto vulnerable groups. Kazakhstan, as a multiethnic \r\nand multi-confessional country, can facilitate a \r\ncomprehensive dialogue among civilizations within the \r\nUnited Nations and various international and regional \r\norganizations. The Congress of Leaders of World and \r\nTraditional Religions, which Kazakhstan convenes \r\nevery three years, contributes to global and regional \r\nsecurity by mobilizing the spiritual and moral potential \r\nof world religions to mitigate international conflicts \r\nso as to prevent confrontations between faiths and \r\ncultures.\r\nAdditionally, at the initiative of Kazakhstan, the \r\nGeneral Assembly proclaimed the period between \r\n2013 and 2022 as the International Decade for the \r\nRapprochement of Cultures. Its official inauguration \r\nwas held in Astana last month, thereby paving the way \r\nfor cultural diversity and tolerance. Kazakhstan calls \r\non Member States actively to participate in the events \r\nof the Decade and to support synergy between the \r\nAlliance of Civilizations and the Congress of Leaders \r\nof World and Traditional Religions.\r\nThe consequences of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis have led to the conclusion that the \r\nworld needs a common policy of global governance. \r\nKazakhstan therefore welcomes the adoption of the \r\nresolution on the United Nations in global economic \r\ngovernance (resolution 67/289), which recognizes the \r\nvalue of cooperation and interaction between the United \r\nNations and various regional and subregional groups.\r\nOver the years, Kazakhstan has hosted the Astana \r\nEconomic Forum, which is now a reputed international \r\nplatform that covers the most pressing and ever-\r\nexpanding issues of the world economy. The first \r\nWorld Anti-Crisis Conference was held as part of the \r\nForum last May in Astana. The Astana Declaration, the \r\nrecommendations of the Astana Economic Forum to \r\nthe Group of 20 leaders and the road map of the World \r\nAnti-Crisis Plan were adopted as outcome documents. \r\n13-48796 9/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nits programmes. Kazakhstan acts as a geographical \r\nand political bridge between North and South, Europe \r\nand Asia. For that reason, it is ideally suited to foster \r\ncooperative initiatives in that vast regional landscape. \r\nPromoting Kazakhstan to the status of a middle-income \r\ncountry represents both challenges and opportunities for \r\nthe development agenda, shifting the focus from being \r\na recipient country to that of a regional development \r\npartner.\r\nRegional cooperation is critical to ensuring national \r\nand regional security. Persistent conflict and instability \r\nin Afghanistan also have an effect on Central Asia. \r\nPoverty, unemployment and growing disparities in \r\neconomic and social development in the countries of \r\nCentral Asia are strong factors indicating the potential \r\nfor new mass population movements, instability, \r\nenvironmental degradation, drug trafficking, religious \r\nextremism and terrorism, all of which must be addressed \r\nthrough regional cooperation. Such collaboration can \r\nbe facilitated through the establishment of a United \r\nNations multi-country centre in Kazakhstan in the city \r\nof Almaty as a hub for promoting regional development, \r\nsecurity and stability. Kazakhstan is ready to bear \r\nall the costs for the construction, equipping and \r\nmaintenance of such a United Nations office bridging \r\nthe gap between Vienna and Bangkok.\r\nThe 20 years of Kazakhstan’s membership and \r\ncooperation with the United Nations have been \r\ncharacterized by the highest dedication to the ideals and \r\nprinciples of the world Organization. We will continue \r\nto play the role of an engaged and responsible Member \r\nState, ready to take on increased responsibilities and \r\nconsistently implement them in full.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Marty Natalegawa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Indonesia. \r\nMr. Natalegawa (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating His Excellency Ambassador John \r\nAshe on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. May I also take \r\nthis opportunity to commend His Excellency Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić for his skilful stewardship of the sixty-seventh \r\nsession. Our profound appreciation of course also goes \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his inspirational \r\nleadership of the Organization.\r\nThe theme of this session — “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage” — is timely \r\nand well-chosen, for we are now making the final push \r\nmust be strengthened for South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation so as to complement official development \r\nassistance activities. Strengthening resilience in order \r\nto withstand external factors such as climate change \r\nand the financial and food crises will have to gain \r\npriority under the new agenda.\r\nIn that regard, Kazakhstan’s chairmanship of the last \r\nand symbolic twentieth session of the Commission on \r\nSustainable Development effected its official transition \r\nand handover to the High-Level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development. The establishment of the \r\nHigh-Level Political Forum is historic as a universal \r\nplatform to meet current realities, closely linked with \r\nglobal security, which justifies the rationale for a \r\ndirect nexus between the High-Level Political Forum \r\nand the Security Council over the issues of food, the \r\nenvironment, energy and water security.\r\nFor the first time since its independence, \r\nKazakhstan has announced its candidature for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2017 to 2018, based on the principles of fair \r\nand equitable geographical rotation and the adequate \r\nrepresentation of all States members of the Asia-Pacific \r\nregional group. The experience we have gained from \r\nrecently chairing a number of regional and international \r\norganizations and forums, such as the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation, the Conference on Interaction \r\nand Confidence-building Measures in Asia, the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization, the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization and others, gives us unique \r\naccess to a wide and diverse range of experiences and \r\napproaches to solving international security problems \r\naddressed by the Security Council.\r\nIf elected, Kazakhstan will unfailingly be united \r\nwith others to contribute to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and will support \r\nefforts to reform the Council, transforming it into a \r\nmore representative and transparent body that can \r\neffectively address the full range of challenges and \r\nthreats facing the world today. We therefore count on \r\nthe broad support of Member States for our candidacy \r\nto the Security Council for the period 2017 to 2018.\r\nLast year, Kazakhstan celebrated the twentieth \r\nanniversary of its accession to the United Nations, \r\nand this year the twentieth anniversary of a United \r\nNations presence in our country. Our Government \r\nand people strongly support the United Nations in all \r\n10/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nof sustainable development and inclusive financing and \r\novercoming the challenges of climate change. We have \r\nin ourselves the wherewithal to address the development \r\nchallenges of our time — for example, to work for an \r\nearly conclusion of the Doha development agenda and a \r\nnew climate-change regime by 2015.\r\nKey to that, however, must be a strong commitment \r\nto the spirit of partnership and an unshakeable belief \r\nin the power of multilateralism: cooperation and \r\ncollaboration rather than discord and division. The \r\ndevelopment agenda must work for all countries, large \r\nor small, developed and developing. Each of us must \r\nshare responsibility. Developed countries must take the \r\nlead, while developing countries must do more.\r\nThe pursuit of a diplomatic path becomes fraught \r\nwith challenges in a complex and fast-changing world \r\nwhere the issues of governance, human rights violations, \r\nextremism and intolerance within countries can \r\nquickly gain inter-State dimensions. We must ensure \r\nthat the institutions of the United Nations are ready to \r\naddress such contemporary challenges. Therefore, as \r\ncountries embark upon a process of democratization \r\nand the promotion and protection of human rights, as \r\nthey draw a line against intolerance and extremism, \r\nthe international community, the United Nations, \r\nmust contribute towards ensuring an atmosphere that \r\nis conducive to their peaceful transformation, one that \r\nreflects the wishes of the peoples concerned.\r\nTogether with its partners in the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Indonesia is \r\nsteadily developing a regional architecture conducive \r\nto the peaceful promotion of human rights and \r\ndemocracy. It is called the ASEAN Political-Security \r\nCommunity. Together with the economic community \r\nand sociocultural community pillars, it makes up the \r\nASEAN Community that we are to achieve by 2015. \r\nThrough a process of sharing lessons learned derived \r\nfrom our respective successes and setbacks, we provide \r\nmutual encouragement and support in our promotion \r\nof the principles of democracy, the rule of law and \r\ngood governance, and respect for and the promotion of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms as inscribed \r\nin the ASEAN Charter.\r\nBeyond South-East Asia, Indonesia is pursuing \r\nthe same positive and constructive approach through \r\nwhat is called the Bali Democracy Forum, a platform \r\nfor countries in the wider region to shareone anothers’ \r\nexperiences. At all levels — national, regional and \r\ntowards the fulfilment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals by the 2015 deadline. Simultaneously, work has \r\nbegun on framing the post-2015 global development \r\nagenda to end extreme poverty and ensure sustainable \r\ngrowth with equity. That agenda must be anchored \r\nby a new global partnership — a vision reflected \r\nin President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono’s role as \r\none of the three co-Chairs of the High-level Panel \r\nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development \r\nAgenda and recognition of the fact that the success of \r\nthe forthcoming intergovernmental process requires \r\nthe capacity to forge a global consensus to identify and \r\nbuild upon common interests. \r\nIndonesia has an enduring belief in the efficacy \r\nand effectiveness of diplomacy, maintaining peace \r\nand security, advancing social progress and economic \r\nprosperity and promoting democracy, human rights and \r\ntolerance.\r\nThe conflict in Syria has long demanded such \r\na political and diplomatic solution, for amid the \r\nundoubted complexity of the situation three key \r\npoints are compelling, namely, halting the violence, \r\nfacilitating humanitarian relief and beginning an \r\ninclusive political process that reflects the wishes of \r\nthe Syrian people. The recent breakthrough on the \r\nissue of chemical weapons in Syria is clear evidence \r\nthat diplomacy works. Further diplomatic momentum \r\nmust be generated. The Security Council must be one to \r\nforcefully make the case for a peaceful settlement. To \r\nget the parties to the negotiating table, the “Geneva II” \r\nconference must be convened at the earliest opportunity.\r\nOn the issue of Palestine, the full weight of \r\ndiplomatic pressure must similarly be brought to \r\nbear and resolutions of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council implemented. The historic injustice \r\nthat the Palestinian people have suffered for so long \r\nmust be ended. We are encouraged by and welcome, \r\ntherefore, the resumption of direct negotiations between \r\nPalestine and Israel, the result, no less, of painstaking \r\nand relentless diplomatic efforts. The revival of the \r\nlong-stalled nuclear disarmament agenda is also \r\nkey. In particular, as co-President of the Article XIV \r\nConference on the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty, Indonesia calls for the early entry into force of \r\nthe Treaty.\r\nThe same relentless diplomatic pursuit must be \r\napplied to what is manifestly in the common interests \r\nof all, that is, the eradication of poverty, the promotion \r\n13-48796 11/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\naddress the critical importance of our relations and \r\ncooperation with countries in our region and with the \r\nbroader community of nations.\r\nTo better illustrate the journey that Afghanistan \r\nand its noble people have been on over the past 12 years, \r\nI should like to share two contrasting pictures of the \r\nreality of Afghanistan — in the year 2001, at the time of \r\nthe collapse of the Taliban regime, and in the year 2013, \r\nas we are going through a historic period and a process \r\nof transition.\r\nFor a little more than two decades prior to November \r\n2001, when the Afghan people ousted the Taliban regime \r\nfrom power, with military backing from the United \r\nStates-led international military coalition, the people \r\nof Afghanistan suffered incalculable pain, deprivation \r\nand losses through three distinct periods. Between \r\nthe communist coup in 1978, followed by the invasion \r\nof our country in 1979, and the fall of the communist \r\nregime, more than 1 million Afghan men, women and \r\nchildren were killed, more than 2 million were made \r\norphans or left with severe war wounds, and more than \r\n5 million were forced out of their villages and towns \r\ninto refugee camps in neighbouring countries, mainly \r\nin Pakistan and Iran, as a result of the brutality of the \r\noccupation and the communist regime and in the course \r\nof our resistance against that occupation. We fought for \r\nour freedom and independence — our holy jihad — and \r\nwe won, in the process helping the national freedom \r\nand independence movements in Eastern Europe.\r\nThe international community that had supported our \r\nstruggle for several years abandoned us when the defeat \r\nand withdrawal of the Red Army became apparent. \r\nExploiting the vacuum and internal strife created during \r\nthe early 1990s, the foreign-backed Taliban movement \r\nrose to power and quickly controlled more than 90 per \r\ncent of Afghan territory. Then, equally quickly, they \r\nremoved their masks and revealed their true identity, \r\nholding the Afghan nation hostage and embarking on a \r\nperiod of particularly cruel and barbaric violence and \r\ncruelty under the guise of Islam. With their backward \r\nviews, violence and brutal suppression of the rights and \r\nfreedoms of the Afghan people, especially women, they \r\nturned our country against itself. The international \r\ncommunity did not mobilize to take action against the \r\nTaliban regime until the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the \r\nUnited States, including in this city.\r\nAt the end of 2001, when, with the military backing \r\nof the United States-led international coalition, we were \r\ngetting ready to drive the Taliban regime from power, \r\nglobal — we remain steadfast in promoting tolerance \r\nand religious freedom, pushing back against prejudice \r\nand intolerance and building partnerships, harmony \r\nand mutual respect. Indonesia recognizes, therefore, the \r\nspecial responsibility incumbent upon it as host of the \r\nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations Global Forum \r\nin 2014, one that aims to promote unity in diversity.\r\nThe primacy of diplomacy and of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes over war and conflict is not \r\nmore evident than in the quiet and yet fundamental \r\ntransformations that have been taking place in \r\nour region, South-East Asia. Notwithstanding the \r\ncontinuing challenges, Indonesia believes that the \r\ndividends of peace and stability are self-evident: \r\neconomic and social progress.\r\nThe continued stability and security of the region \r\nis therefore the key to securing our prosperity. Peace \r\nand development are indivisible. With other ASEAN \r\nnations, Indonesia has worked constantly to develop \r\nthe region’s capacity to manage and overcome any \r\npotential for conflict and to ensure that it remains a \r\nnet contributor to international peace and security; to \r\nextend the arc of stability beyond South-East Asia to the \r\nAsia-Pacific region at large while promoting common \r\nsecurity, common prosperity and common stability \r\nfor all in the region; and, through commitments to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the renunciation \r\nof the use or threat of force, to ensure that the region \r\nplaces diplomacy at the forefront.\r\nIndonesia will be tireless in promoting the primacy \r\nof diplomacy, and unwavering in its belief in the noble \r\ngoals of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Zalmai Rassoul, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Rassoul (Afghanistan): I bring to all warm \r\ngreetings and the good wishes of the Afghan people. \r\nI have the honour to address the General Assembly \r\nin the last year of the current elected Government of \r\nAfghanistan. I therefore think that it is useful briefly to \r\nrevisit the story of Afghanistan over the past 12 years, \r\nour historic successes, the achievements that have \r\ntransformed Afghanistan and, yes, the challenges we \r\nhave faced continuously during that time. I should \r\nthen like to share with the Assembly the vision of \r\nthe Afghan people and Government for the future of \r\nfreedom, dignity, prosperity and democracy that we \r\nare striving to solidify in our country and, briefly, to \r\n12/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nand our trade ties with the outside world are rapidly \r\nexpanding.\r\nToday in the new Afghanistan the number of children \r\nattending school stands at well over 10 million, 40 per \r\ncent of them girls, and there are hundreds of thousands \r\nof young men and women attending some 70 public \r\nand private colleges and universities. More than 70 per \r\ncent of our people today have access to basic health-\r\ncare services. That, among other things, has increased \r\naverage life expectancy from approximately 40 years to \r\nmore the 60 years in just one decade.\r\nWe have built thousands of kilometres of roads, \r\nirrigation canals, bridges and other pieces of our \r\ncountry’s critical physical infrastructure, thereby \r\ncutting travel time and facilitating trade and movement \r\nwithin the country and with neighbouring countries. \r\nAfghanistan today is a proud and active member of \r\nthe international community, while managing its ever-\r\nexpanding relations and cooperation with countries and \r\norganizations throughout the world, through a network \r\nof some 70 diplomatic and consular missions.\r\nThe examples of rejuvenation and development, \r\nprogress and achievements that I have just described \r\nrepresent the true picture of today’s Afghanistan. \r\nConsidering that 12 years is not a very long time in \r\nthe history of a country, especially a country such as \r\nAfghanistan, which has gone through more than 35 \r\nyears of war and destruction, those achievements and \r\ngains are nothing short of a historic transformation. \r\nI have drawn that clear contrast between the \r\nAfghanistan of 10 years ago and the positive reality of \r\ntoday for two main reasons: first, to underscore a model \r\nof collective action and international cooperation in \r\nsupport of one country’s efforts to establish peace, \r\nsecurity and development; and, secondly, to counter \r\na narrative of doom and gloom for Afghanistan by \r\nthose who are ignorant about our progress, or who \r\nharbour ill-will towards us. The new Afghanistan is \r\nindeed currently going through a critical period of \r\nsecurity, economic and political transition that comes \r\nwith its difficulties and challenges but that is helping \r\nus to consolidate our f ledgling democratic order and \r\nstrengthening our national sovereignty, independence \r\nand ownership of our own affairs.\r\nThat is the vision of the Afghan people and \r\nGovernment for the years leading up to the completion \r\nof the transition in 2014 and into the transformation \r\ndecade of 2015 to 2024. In the security area it is our \r\nAfghanistan was in near-total isolation from the region \r\nand the world community. The Afghan people were a \r\nterrorized population, without rights or freedoms and \r\nwithout protection from the Taliban regime’s brutality. \r\nSevere poverty and disease were endemic, with little \r\nor no access to health-care services. The education \r\nsystem, which completely excluded women and girls \r\nand had fewer than half a million male students \r\nattending schools and universities, was a catastrophic \r\nfailure. The average annual per capita income was \r\nabout $100 and the country lacked a single national \r\ncurrency. Our roads, bridges, irrigation networks and \r\nother components of critical national infrastructure \r\nwere completely destroyed. Afghanistan was without \r\na national army or a national police force, and all our \r\nother State institutions had been reduced to nothing. In \r\nshort, Afghanistan was a failed State, ruled by a proxy \r\nmilitant group that provided shelter to international \r\nterrorists, thus posing a real danger to regional and \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan during that period \r\nwas indeed bleak. The Afghan people had little hope for \r\ntheir own or their children’s future. However, following \r\nthe Al-Qaida terrorist attacks in the United States, the \r\nAfghan people came together and, with support from the \r\nUnited States and a multitude of other friends and allies \r\nin the international community, removed the Taliban \r\nfrom power and embarked upon a new era of hope, \r\nreconstruction, development and progress — a new \r\nera marked by an entirely different reality. Primarily \r\nas a result of our own sacrifices and the considerable \r\nsacrifices and support of our international friends and \r\nallies during our 12-year partnership, Afghanistan once \r\nagain has become the home of all Afghans, men and \r\nwomen, where they enjoy equal rights and freedoms \r\nunder our democratic Constitution.\r\nToday Afghanistan is a forward-looking young \r\ndemocracy with functioning State institutions, an elected \r\nPresident, an elected Parliament and elected provincial \r\ncouncils in each one of our 34 provinces, backed up by a \r\npowerful civil society movement. Afghan independent \r\nmedia, with approximately 50 independent television \r\nchannels, more than 100 community FM radio stations \r\nand hundreds of print publications, are arguably among \r\nthe freest in the region. Today there are more than \r\n20 million mobile-phone users across Afghanistan, \r\nan increasing number of them accessing information \r\nand using various platforms on the Internet. Per capita \r\nincome has increased from $100 a year to $600 a year, \r\nour national currency has been consistently stable, \r\n13-48796 13/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nIn addition to our best efforts to fulfil Afghanistan’s \r\nrole as the trade, transit and economic integration \r\nroundabout in the heart of Asia region for the benefit \r\nof all people of the region, the Afghan Government is \r\nkeen to reduce the negative economic impact of the \r\ninternational military withdrawal and to strengthen our \r\nnational economy in at least three ways. \r\nThe first is by focusing on the development of the \r\nagriculture and agribusiness sector, in which more than \r\n70 per cent of our population is directly or indirectly \r\nengaged, and where there is enormous potential for \r\ngrowth and employment generation. \r\nSecondly, Afghanistan is estimated to hold trillions \r\nof dollars of natural resources, including minerals and \r\nhydrocarbons, representing a guaranteed source of \r\nwealth and income for generations to come. We already \r\nhave several State-owned and private companies — from \r\nChina, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and other countries, in addition \r\nto Afghan companies — expressing a keen interest in \r\ninvesting billions of dollars in copper, iron ore, gold, \r\nrare-Earth minerals, oil and gas. We are actively \r\nseeking to attract additional foreign investment to this \r\nsector, while remaining duly diligent to make sure that \r\nour natural riches serve the goal of a strong legitimate \r\nnational economy and improved prosperity and welfare \r\nfor the Afghan people.\r\nThirdly, the Tokyo Conference last July pledged \r\nmore than $16 billion through 2015 to help the Afghan \r\nGovernment fill its projected fiscal gap. Conference \r\nparticipants also committed to providing additional \r\nfinancial assistance to Afghanistan beyond 2016 at \r\nor near the levels of the past decade. That generous \r\nfinancial support will be critical in tiding us over the \r\nnext few years.\r\nIn addition to the security and economic transitions, \r\nwe have a crucial political transition coming up next \r\nyear, namely, the presidential and provincial council \r\nelections. Next year’s presidential elections will mark \r\nthe first time in our history that one elected President \r\nwill transfer power to another elected President \r\nthrough a peaceful democratic process. The Afghan \r\nGovernment is doing everything possible to ensure \r\nfree, fair and credible elections, so that the Afghan \r\npeople can choose who the next President will be. A \r\nsuccessful presidential election will entrench our \r\ndemocratic process and greatly contribute to our efforts \r\ntowards lasting peace, security and prosperity.\r\nmore than 350,000 brave and professional soldiers \r\nand police officers — not foreign soldiers — who are \r\ndirectly responsible for the security of more than 90 per \r\ncent of the Afghan population. The transfer of security \r\nresponsibilities from the international forces to Afghan \r\nnational security forces, launched in the summer of \r\n2011, will be completed throughout the country by \r\nthe end of 2014. Our forces have demonstrated their \r\ncourage, commitment and effectiveness in successfully \r\ntaking over from their international partners. It is \r\nthrough the enormous and self less sacrifices of our \r\nproud and patriotic national security forces on a daily \r\nbasis that security in most cities and towns that have \r\ngone through transition has improved and the Taliban \r\nhave been beaten back. We are fully confident that, with \r\nthe continued financial assistance of the international \r\ncommunity for equipment and other requirements and \r\nneeds, as pledged at the Chicago NATO Summit in May \r\n2012, Afghan national forces will be able to provide \r\nsecurity to the Afghan people and defend the country \r\nagainst external threats.\r\nParallel to our ongoing efforts to enhance the \r\ncapacity and capabilities of our national security \r\nforces, the Afghan Government is pursuing a political \r\nprocess of peace and reconciliation with the Taliban. \r\nThe key principles and conditions for that process \r\nare clear: respect for Afghanistan’s Constitution, \r\nwhich guarantees full and equal rights to Afghan \r\nmen and women; the preservation and enhancement \r\nof the advances made over the past decade; and the \r\nrenunciation of violence against the population.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, a major neighbour, \r\ncan play a key role in supporting our peace process. \r\nWe have been heartened by the recent successful visit \r\nto Islamabad by President Karzai and the positive and \r\nconstructive dialogue that took place between the two \r\nGovernments during that visit. We look forward to \r\nfurther steps and progress in the weeks and months to \r\ncome. Pakistan’s essential role in advancing the Afghan \r\npeace process is a clear example of the support that \r\nAfghanistan’s neighbours and other countries in the \r\nregion, especially Muslim countries, can provide to the \r\nAfghan peace process.\r\nAs far as the economic component of transition \r\nis concerned, the presence of a large international \r\nmilitary force over the past 10 years has generated \r\nemployment and income opportunities for thousands of \r\nour citizens, so it is natural that there will be an adverse \r\nimpact resulting from the withdrawal of those forces. \r\n14/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nof the Process, the Afghan Government is particularly \r\ngrateful to the People’s Republic of China for hosting \r\nthe next ministerial meeting next summer.\r\nIn addition to improving cooperation and confidence \r\non a whole range of other issues, all countries in our \r\nregion, and our allies and friends in the international \r\ncommunity, must continue decisively to confront \r\nthe single biggest challenge that still endangers our \r\ncollective peace and security and undermines the \r\nwelfare of our people, namely, the continuing menace \r\nof terrorism and extremism and their sanctuaries and \r\nsupport systems in the region. We will not achieve the \r\nfull potential of our citizens or realize true and lasting \r\npeace and security in Afghanistan or the wider region \r\nuntil we have dealt decisively with the brutality and \r\nevilness of the terrorists who try to harm us every day. \r\nFortunately, we are more hopeful now than in the past \r\nabout a gathering common approach against terrorism \r\nand extremism in our region. \r\nThis year’s General Assembly session is taking place \r\nat a time in which the United Nations has seen a number \r\nof conflicts continue, while new ones have taken shape. \r\nIn Syria, we watch the ongoing immeasurable suffering \r\nof the great people of that country. Afghanistan calls \r\nfor an immediate halt to the violence there, which has \r\ntaken the lives of more than 100,000 people, forced \r\nmore than 2 million Syrians to become refugees and \r\nleft 6.8 million people in urgent need of humanitarian \r\nassistance. We strongly support a political solution, \r\nreached through a broad-based national dialogue that \r\nmeets the aspirations of all Syrians. Moreover, the \r\ninternational community must provide the support \r\nnecessary to address the humanitarian needs of those \r\naffected by the conflict, including the millions who \r\nhave sought refuge in neighbouring countries. \r\nSpeaking of long-standing conflicts, none is more \r\nevident than the decades-long strife between Palestine \r\nand Israel. Following years of deadlock and impasse, \r\nwe see that renewed efforts for a peaceful settlement \r\nhave emerged with the resumption of direct negotiations \r\nbetween the two sides. That is an important development, \r\nwhich we hope will result in durable peace, enabled by \r\nthe establishment of an independent Palestinian State. \r\nWe also hope to witness the inclusion of the State of \r\nPalestine as a full Member of the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, as I stand before the Assembly, I \r\nfeel more strongly than ever that our shared vision of a \r\nworld free from violence, conflict and destitution will \r\nbe achieved only if we put our differences aside and act \r\nAs we go forward in implementing the transition \r\nagenda and preparing for the transformation decade, \r\nanother key foundation of our long-term success will \r\nbe the strategic partnerships we have forged with some \r\nof our closest friends and allies over the past few years. \r\nSince October 2011, when we signed our first long-term \r\nstrategic partnership agreement with the Republic of \r\nIndia, we have entered into similar partnerships with the \r\nUnited States, Germany, Australia, France, the United \r\nKingdom, Italy, Norway, Finland, Denmark and Poland. \r\nWe have also concluded or are currently negotiating \r\nsimilar partnerships with the European Union, Turkey \r\nand the United Arab Emirates. In that regard, I should \r\nlike to reiterate the Afghan Government and people’s \r\nappreciation for the solid and broad-based expression of \r\nlong-term political support for a peaceful, prosperous, \r\ndemocratic Afghanistan by more than 100 countries \r\nand organizations at the historic international Bonn \r\nConference, kindly hosted by the German Government \r\nin December 2011. \r\nWith the United States, we are negotiating a \r\nseparate bilateral security agreement that will define \r\nthe parameters of the long-term security and defence \r\ncooperation between our two countries. I should like \r\nto reiterate our long-standing principled position that \r\nany bilateral security agreements that Afghanistan \r\nsigns with other countries, including the United States, \r\nwill be purely for the purpose of ensuring peace, \r\nsecurity, development and the consolidation of our \r\nyoung democracy, and not directed at our neighbours \r\nor any countries in the region. Afghanistan belongs to \r\nits region. As recent history has clearly demonstrated, \r\nthe peace, security and stability of Afghanistan, as the \r\ncentre of the heart of Asia region, has a direct impact \r\non the peace, security and stability of the entire region, \r\nand vice versa. We want Afghanistan to serve its \r\nrightful role as a key land bridge in our vital region \r\nfor the f low of people, goods and investments. In that \r\ncontext, the Istanbul Process on Regional Security and \r\nCooperation for a Secure and Stable Afghanistan, which \r\nwe launched together with our Turkish friends and all \r\nother participating and supporting States in November \r\n2011, is of vital importance for confidence-building \r\nand promoting results-oriented cooperation. \r\nTwo follow-on ministerial meetings, in Kabul in \r\nJune 2012 and in Almaty in April of this year, have \r\ntaken the Process to the level of maturity. It has now \r\ndeveloped into a meaningful forum for discussion on \r\nspecific confidence-building measures and enjoys \r\nconsiderable momentum. As the permanent co-Chair \r\n13-48796 15/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nthat appalling bloodshed. That is another of the major \r\nchallenges for the credibility of the United Nations. Let \r\nme elaborate on those challenges. \r\nWith more than a threefold increase in the world’s \r\npopulation since the founding of the United Nations \r\nand with unprecedented technological progress and \r\nthe ever-increasing exploitation of natural resources, \r\nthe world has changed irrevocably. We must now \r\narrange our existence with our natural environment \r\nin a new way. As the Secretary-General has said, \r\nsustainable development is the pathway to the future. \r\nEcological sustainability — respecting the planetary \r\nboundaries — is the foundation for all development. \r\nThe alarming trend in climate change underlines the \r\nurgent need to heed those limits. We must work together \r\ntowards a comprehensive climate agreement by 2015. \r\nThe consequences of climate change are already to be \r\nseen worldwide. The impacts are predicted to intensify \r\nin the coming years and decades. For instance, billions of \r\npeople lack access to safe water sources and sanitation. \r\nWithout radical reforms, that number is expected to \r\nrise dramatically. There is also significant potential for \r\nconflicts over water and other natural resources in the \r\ncoming years.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in reducing \r\nextreme poverty. Millions of people have had a \r\nchance to lift themselves out of poverty. However, \r\ninequality still persists, and in many cases is increasing \r\nboth within countries and between them. In several \r\ncountries not a single Millennium Development Goal \r\nwill be attained. More than 1 billion people still live in \r\nextreme poverty, and they are falling behind. Poverty \r\ncan be eradicated only within the context of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Development must be ecologically, \r\neconomically and socially sustainable. It must be firmly \r\nanchored in human rights and the values encapsulated \r\nin the Millennium Declaration. Peace and security are \r\na precondition for sustainable development. \r\nThe post-2015 process must also include a \r\nfinancing strategy for sustainable development. We \r\nare honoured, together with Nigeria, to be co-chairing \r\nthe Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing, mandated by \r\nthe Rio+20 Summit. We will work hard to achieve a \r\nstrategy proposal that is action-oriented and inclusive \r\nand covers a broad range of different aspects of \r\ndevelopment financing.\r\nI am convinced that sustainable development \r\nfinancing must be based on national resource \r\nas one. If we adhere to the principles of understanding, \r\nsolidarity and cooperation, we will be able to secure our \r\ncollective future, as evidenced in the historic successes \r\nwe have achieved in Afghanistan over the past 12 years.\r\nThe United Nations has been a reliable partner in \r\nhelping us come this far. As we prepare to embark upon \r\nthe transformation decade, we expect the Organization \r\nto continue its support through a renewed approach that \r\nreinforces Afghanistan’s leadership and ownership. Let \r\nme also assure the Assembly that, as we in Afghanistan \r\nwork to preserve our gains and consolidate our young \r\ndemocracy in the crucial years ahead, we will remain \r\nan active Member of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Erkki Tuomioja, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Finland.\r\nMr. Tuomioja (Finland): We have convened here \r\nin New York at a time that poses enormous challenges \r\nto the authority and credibility of the United Nations. \r\nFirst, we are at a crossroads where we have to decide \r\nthe future course to attain sustainable development. \r\nSpeaking for Finland at the Rio de Janeiro Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20), I stressed \r\nthat, faced with advancing climate change and the \r\naccelerating loss of biodiversity, we might, at best, \r\nhave only a few decades in which to reach ecologically, \r\nsocially and economically sustainable development. \r\nDecisive action based on a sense of urgency is needed \r\nto turn the tide globally before it is too late. Either \r\nwe succeed in that together or we are going to perish \r\ntogether.\r\nThis week, we have taken stock of progress towards \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. They have been a \r\npowerful tool to direct our action. In the near future, \r\nwe are expected to agree on a new development agenda, \r\na new set of goals that, in my view, could be called \r\nsustainable development goals. A green economy is not \r\na luxury, but a prerequisite, for poverty reduction and \r\nsustainability. In short, the new agenda must be even \r\nbolder and more ambitious than the previous one. Its \r\nimplementation will require action in all countries.\r\nSecondly, we are facing a failure of the United \r\nNations to act in its core domain, that is, in maintaining \r\npeace and security. One hundred and ten thousand \r\npeople have been killed and 2 million people have \r\nbeen forced to leave their homes in Syria, where a \r\ntragic civil war has been going on for more than two \r\nyears. The United Nations has been unable to act to end \r\n16/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nwar crime for which those responsible must be brought \r\nto justice through referral to the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Finland welcomes the agreement reached on \r\na strongly worded Security Council resolution to \r\ncollect and destroy chemical weapons in Syria under \r\ninternational control. There can be no impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of war crimes and other atrocities. \r\nThe agreement has to be followed through with a \r\npolitical solution to the conflict. That is the only way \r\nto stop the violence. That means negotiations. The \r\ninternational community, the parties to the conflict and \r\nespecially the Security Council must take responsibility \r\nfor working towards political negotiations. We continue \r\nto support the initiative of the United States and Russia \r\nof proposing the “Geneva II” conference, as well as \r\nthe mediation by the United Nations and Arab League \r\nJoint Special Representative, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi. \r\nAll permanent members of the Security Council must \r\nshoulder their responsibility.\r\nThe humanitarian suffering of the Syrian people \r\ncontinues. We all must intensify our work to help \r\nthe refugees and support the neighbouring countries \r\nbearing the heaviest burdens. The United Nations \r\nwill also need to have a strong presence in Syria after \r\nthe arms have fallen silent. Finland stands ready to \r\ncontribute to a possible United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperation to be established in Syria.\r\nThe resumption of direct final status negotiations \r\nbetween the Palestinians and the Israelis is long-awaited \r\nand most welcome news. Since the Oslo agreement 20 \r\nyears ago, it has been clear that the best outcome for all \r\nthe parties is a two-State solution, which can accomplish \r\na reign of peace and security for the two peoples. We \r\nmay still have at hand perhaps the last chance for such \r\na resolution of the conflict. When I say “perhaps the \r\nlast chance”, it is not because I think there may be more \r\nchances later, but rather it is because, at worst, the last \r\nchance may already have been missed. But it is our duty \r\nto make the effort to achieve a negotiated two-State \r\nsolution.\r\nFinland commends Secretary Kerry’s dedication \r\nand the personal commitment demonstrated by the \r\nparties. The entire international community must lend \r\nall its support for the negotiations to succeed. That must \r\nbe concrete and effective support. The role of regional \r\npartners is crucial, and I welcome the efforts made by \r\nthe League of Arab States in reviewing the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative.\r\nmobilization and management. Nations should mobilize \r\ntheir own resources through inclusive economic \r\naction and through responsible international trade and \r\ninvestments. Developing national taxation systems \r\nand tax-revenue collection, as well as addressing \r\nunregulated capital f light and putting an end to illegal \r\ntax evasion and tax havens, should be central elements \r\nin sustainable development financing. Our own national \r\nexperience shows that taxation is an effective means of \r\naddressing inequality.\r\nDirect foreign investment can be a driver for \r\ngrowth and development. Investment should be \r\nsustainable, accountable and adhere to norms of \r\ncorporate social responsibility in creating economic \r\nand social development. The current proliferation of \r\nbilateral investment agreements, already numbering in \r\nthe thousands, is not the best way to manage investment \r\nf lows or set the rules they should follow. As part of \r\nour efforts to promote sustainable and fair financial \r\ngovernance, Finland supports efforts to create an \r\ninternational investment regime that is transparent, \r\nbalanced and equitable.\r\nThe sustainable development goals must be \r\nuniversal, and they must integrate different dimensions \r\nof development. Fears that sustainable development \r\nwould challenge the traditional development agenda \r\nare unfounded. These agendas are not competing, but \r\ncomplement each other. We must do our utmost to \r\nagree on a new way to sustainable development in the \r\nvery near future. Our planet and its citizens cannot \r\nwait. We, the States Members of the United Nations, \r\nare shouldering a great responsibility in that respect. \r\nWe must be able to deliver as the United Nations.\r\nWe also have more traditional security challenges \r\nat hand. The conflict in Syria has seriously undermined \r\nthe authority and credibility of the United Nations. \r\nThe United Nations has not been able to act in its core \r\ndomain in maintaining peace and security. Both the \r\nSyrian Government and the international community \r\nhave failed to implement their responsibility to protect.\r\nThe situation in Syria started as a peaceful and \r\njustified call for reforms. The Government’s response \r\nthen turned it into an increasingly violent conflict and \r\na breeding ground for terrorist extremism. That has led \r\nto humanitarian suffering, which has already reached \r\nhistoric proportions. The use of chemical weapons on \r\n21 August near Damascus can be a turning point in the \r\nconflict: the universal condemnation of their use as a \r\n13-48796 17/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nOnly when the Treaty enters into force and is \r\nimplemented will it make a real difference in saving \r\nlives, minimizing human suffering and lessening \r\ncriminality and threats to civilian populations by \r\nproviding the highest common standards for the \r\ntrade in arms, ammunition and components. Once \r\nagain, I should like to thank and congratulate the \r\nnon-governmental organization community for its \r\ndedication and tireless efforts in favour of the ATT. \r\nThey never lost their faith and pushed Governments \r\nhard to achieve that result. But our work is not yet done. \r\nTogether we must continue to secure the 50 ratifications \r\nneeded and ensure more to support for the ATT. We \r\nmust also persuade those countries that abstained in the \r\nvoting to support a regulated arms trade and the Treaty \r\nso as to make it universal.\r\nFinland, as one of the seven co-authors, has from the \r\nbeginning been and will in future be very much involved \r\nwith the Arms Trade Treaty. This week, the co-authors \r\norganized a high-level event to promote the signing \r\nof the Treaty. We are also prepared to assist countries \r\nthat have difficulties in ratifying and implementing \r\nthe Treaty. When implemented, the Treaty should also \r\nhave a major impact on development, particularly in the \r\nleast developed countries, where conflicts are a major \r\nobstacle to development.\r\nThe success or failure of the United Nations \r\nultimately depends upon us, the Member States. There \r\nis no alternative to the United Nations. Let us give it a \r\nchance. That is what our peoples expect from us.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Elías Jaua Milano, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Jaua Milano (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, on behalf \r\nof the people and the President of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, I \r\nwould like to convey to General Assembly President \r\nJohn Ashe our congratulations on his recent election to \r\nlead this organ of the United Nations. \r\nAs is known, President Maduro Moros is not here \r\nat this session of the General Assembly because of a \r\nwhole range of delays, obstacles, conditions imposed \r\nand lack of guarantees for him and members of his \r\ndelegation, imposed by the Government of the United \r\nStates in f lagrant violation of the obligations incumbent \r\nupon it under the Headquarters Agreement. Despite \r\nThe situations in both Syria and the Middle East \r\nand between Israel and the Palestinians have been \r\nthe subject of important mediation efforts. I call for \r\nstronger political will and determination to resolve \r\nthose conflicts. The parties must work harder and the \r\nSecurity Council, especially its permanent members, \r\nmust shoulder their responsibility. While those efforts \r\nhave yet to meet with success, I believe that we also \r\nhave ample evidence to show that mediation works. \r\nMeasures under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \r\nNations deserve more attention, although sometimes \r\naction under Chapter VII is also needed. Finland and \r\nTurkey continue to co-Chair the Group of Friends \r\nof Mediation and to work to strengthen preventive \r\ndiplomacy, including mediation in the United Nations.\r\nMediation can succeed only with political will from \r\nthe parties and the international community. Successful \r\nmediation also calls for the full and equal participation \r\nof women at all stages. Women are certainly most often \r\nthe victims of conflicts, but we should also understand \r\nthat they are essential participants for any mediation \r\nefforts to bear long-lasting success.\r\nEfforts to promote peace and security in the Middle \r\nEast should go in parallel with the pursuit of the long-\r\ntime goal of the establishment of a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction in \r\nthat region. I encourage all regional parties to continue \r\nto engage constructively with the facilitator and the \r\nfour conveners, as well as with one another, to pave \r\nthe way for a conference on the establishment of such \r\na zone.\r\nAll our failures and disappointments notwithstanding, \r\nthere has also been one true success story for the United \r\nNations this year. I am referring to the Arms Trade Treaty \r\n(ATT), which was adopted in April after decades of \r\neffort. It was a success not only for the United Nations \r\nsystem but for the whole international community \r\nand the arms control regime. The importance of the \r\nTreaty has been confirmed by the growing number of \r\nsignatories after 3 June, when the ATT was opened \r\nfor signature. We hope and expect that the signing of \r\nthe ATT by the United States will be followed by the \r\nsigning of all other permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil as well. I should also like to congratulate those \r\ncountries that have already ratified the Treaty, thereby \r\npaving the way for its early entry into force. My own \r\ncountry, Finland, is well on its way to ratifying the ATT \r\nas soon as possible.\r\n18/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nIn the meantime, countries such as Venezuela \r\nhave chosen the path to consolidate real democracy \r\nwith a socialist system, including the people, and that \r\nhas enabled us to reach the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Yet we are constantly attacked and demonized \r\nand our political and social stability is being disrupted. \r\nThat is what is happening at this very moment with \r\nthe anti-democratic opposition in our country, which \r\nis being supported by media corporations in the region \r\nand from the whole world.\r\nParagraph 4, Article 2, of the Charter of the United \r\nNations emphatically states that \r\n“All members shall refrain in their international \r\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of \r\nany state”. \r\nYet the President of the United States — and there is \r\nthe additional irritant that he is a Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureate — is threatening to bomb this or that country if \r\nit does not comply with his country’s unilateral demands, \r\nwhich can even include removing a Government that \r\nthe United States Government does not like. Perhaps \r\nthat could explain why, despite the fact that the Charter \r\ntalks about the equality of large and small nations, the \r\nPresident of the United States said just a couple of days \r\nago that the United States was “exceptional”. Does that \r\nmean that they are not equal with the other 192 States \r\nMember States represented here?\r\nThe gap today between the noble ideals of the \r\nCharter and what is happening by act or omission \r\nhere in the Organization is truly alarming. Why does \r\nnobody in the General Assembly venture to propose \r\nthat sanctions be imposed for open violations of the \r\nCharter on the Government that has an illegal detention \r\ncentre in the military base at Guantánamo, in occupied \r\nCuban territory, where torture and cruel and degrading \r\nand inhuman treatment is being meted out to persons? \r\nWhy does nobody discuss sanctions against \r\nthe President who has admitted to illegal espionage \r\nactivities against Heads of State and Government \r\nrepresented here? That was a point courageously \r\nmade by the President of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff (see \r\nA/68/PV.5).\r\nWhy do we not consider the use of unpiloted \r\nplanes — so-called drones — which have taken the \r\nlives of tens of thousands of innocent victims, including \r\nthat, we have come here on behalf of the people of the \r\nliberator, Simón Bolívar, to speak the truth and to ask \r\nsome questions, firmly but respectfully, as we learned \r\nfrom our leader, Hugo Chávez Frías, who passed away \r\nin March. In that regard, on behalf of my people, I \r\nshould like to express our gratitude for the heartfelt \r\ntribute paid to President Chávez Frías last March (see \r\nA/67/PV.67).\r\nHow happy we would be to be here if we were \r\nreally in a place where we realized the noble ideals \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nCharter talks about saving succeeding generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war, but the truth is that various \r\nmilitary interventions have been decided upon or have \r\nbeen allowed here that have engulfed countries and \r\nwhole regions of the world in long wars and instability. \r\nThe Security Council has been taken hostage by the \r\nhawks of war, and when they can, they justify their \r\nattacks from there; when they cannot, they simply bang \r\non the table and still do whatever they want, which is \r\nwhat they are doing when they declare that there will be \r\nfuture bombings in the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nThe Charter also states that the purpose of the \r\nOrganization is to preserve international peace and \r\nsecurity. But let me ask: How do some members of the \r\nSecurity Council think we can achieve that purpose by \r\narming and protecting terrorist groups such as Jabhat \r\nAl-Nusra and Al-Qaida, which are obscurantist forces? \r\nMany of those groups are linked to horrible acts such as \r\nthe destruction of the Twin Towers in this very city. They \r\ndeny the existence of anybody who thinks differently \r\nfrom them — whether they be Christians, Muslims \r\nor Jews — and profess special hatred and rejection of \r\nwomen. Why are such groups supported? Why do some \r\nmembers of the Security Council sponsor such terrorist \r\ngroups, window-dressing them as political opposition \r\nand even allowing them to give press conferences at this \r\nvenue? What would representatives of Governments \r\nwith ongoing internal armed conflicts say if the violent \r\ngroups they faced were to be given space and a voice \r\nhere at Headquarters to justify their downfall?\r\nThe Preamble of the Charter also sets out another \r\nnoble goal: to promote social progress and raise the \r\nstandard of living in a broader concept of freedom. \r\nIn reality, however, poverty, hunger and injustice are \r\ncontinuing to grow and the standard of living and the \r\nstandard of freedoms are falling lower and lower. That \r\nis because what is imposed on us is a model of excluding \r\nothers — a neo-fascist model — a neo-liberal model.\r\n13-48796 19/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nthe most complex and sophisticated spying system that \r\nhumankind has ever been able to come up with.\r\nThanks to those revelations this year, we have \r\nwoken up to discover that George Orwell’s 1984 is \r\nnow here. And what is the United Nations doing about \r\nthat? Who is setting limits on so much arbitrariness \r\nand running roughshod? Those are yet more questions \r\nthat find no answers from the General Assembly or the \r\nSecurity Council of the Organization, which is now \r\nalmost 68 years old.\r\nWe would like to suggest that the Secretary-General \r\nset up a body within the United Nations to ensure for \r\nevery inhabitant in the world the right to privacy and \r\nthe right to communicate without interception. Much \r\nhas been said here calling for peace, but that has often \r\nfallen on deaf ears. Let us hope that we will all learn \r\nhow important it is to listen to the calls of the people for \r\npeace, and employ that in tirelessly seeking to elevate \r\nhuman dignity as our guiding star.\r\nPresident John Kennedy spoke from this rostrum \r\n50 years ago, the last time he would do so at the United \r\nNations before being assassinated. How good it would \r\nbe if his current successor, and many people here, \r\nwere to re-read just some of what he said. Whatever \r\ndifferences we may have had with that historic figure, \r\nensuring peace requires that we seek out areas of \r\nagreement such as this:\r\n“For the value of this body’s work is not \r\ndependent on the existence of emergencies — nor \r\ncan the winning of peace consist only of dramatic \r\nvictories. Peace is a daily, a weekly, a monthly \r\nprocess, gradually changing opinions, slowly \r\neroding old barriers, quietly building new \r\nstructures. And, however undramatic the pursuit of \r\npeace, that pursuit must go on.” (A/PV.1209, p. 5)\r\nLet us hope that the leaders of the United States and \r\nthose that follow them blindly will think deeply about \r\nthe meaning of what Kennedy said and realize that if \r\nthey really want to be exceptional, they have to find \r\nexceptional ways of bringing about lasting peace in the \r\nworld.\r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean we are \r\nshowing that with exceptional decisions and actions we \r\ncan build a world of peace. Unity in diversity is what \r\nwe have in our regional organizations: the Bolivarian \r\nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America, the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nchildren and old people, in North Africa, the Middle \r\nEast and parts of Asia to be crimes against humanity?  \r\nWhy do we not impose sanctions against a \r\nGovernment that for more than 50 years has maintained \r\nan illegal and criminal economic blockade against the \r\nworthy Cuban people, and f louted decisions adopted by \r\noverwhelming majorities in the Assembly in favour of \r\nending the embargo?\r\nWhy do we not implement the resolutions adopted \r\nby the plenary so that the State of Palestine can be \r\nestablished as a peaceful, just and lasting solution to \r\nthe ongoing Arab-Israeli conflict? \r\nWhy does the United Kingdom not agree to start \r\nnegotiations with Argentina to resolve in a peaceful \r\nway demands over the Malvinas Islands? Might it \r\nperchance be because the elite of the United States and \r\nsome of its allies are exceptional?\r\nWe raise those questions for consideration when it \r\ncomes to the future of humankind, on behalf of the people \r\nof Simón Bolívar — the people of Venezuela — who \r\nlove peace, equality and freedom. \r\nVenezuela has come before the General Assembly \r\ntoday to condemn a kidnapping. The Organization has \r\nbeen kidnapped. The peace and dignity of the world \r\nare being held hostage in New York. The kidnapper has \r\nmany faces. It changes names and sometimes even f lags, \r\nbut it continues to be the same old imperalism. Eight \r\nyears ago, Commander Hugo Chávez Frías — a tireless \r\ndefender of genuine peace, not the peace imposed by \r\nbombs, and of participatory democracy and a leader \r\nfor unity among peoples — called here for a genuine \r\ntransformation of the United Nations. Seven years ago, \r\nhe said that there was a whiff of sulphur here (see A/61/\r\nPV.12). Today, alas, I have to say once again that there is \r\nstill a whiff of sulphur coming from those who consider \r\nthemselves exceptional.\r\nThose words are truer now than ever before. The \r\ncourageous revelations of one young man offered a \r\ngreat service to humankind — let us call it a wake-up \r\ncall. As a result, he is now being persecuted politically \r\nand cannot walk freely in the streets of Manhattan. We \r\nhope that Edward Snowden will one day be able to walk \r\nfreely among a future generation of Americans who \r\nhave taken back their civil rights and helped to ensure \r\npeace in the world. That young man has shown us how \r\nthe privacy of every human being has been violated by \r\n20/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention \r\nand five minutes for the second, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): We all heard the reference to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea made this morning by the \r\nrepresentative of South Korea (see A/68/PV.15). On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, I should like to totally reject that \r\nreference as misleading of the reality prevailing on \r\nthe Korean peninsula and as a distortion of the truth. \r\nI should like to clarify the position of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nFirst, South Korea made a reference to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea — the seriousness of its \r\nweapons of mass destruction programme. That is one \r\npart of the story of the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula; he missed the other part of the story.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and \r\nits people have been living with nuclear weapons and \r\nbombs over their heads for decades. In 1957, they \r\nbrought into South Korea the first nuclear weapon, \r\nmarking the beginning of the presence of nuclear \r\nweapons and of the largest nuclear-weapon threat. In the \r\n1970s, it had reached more than 1,000 nuclear weapons \r\ncoming into South Korea, again by the United States. \r\nIn 2002, the United States Administration of that time \r\nproclaimed the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nto be part of the “axis of evil”, which means it should be \r\neliminated. It was listed as a nuclear pre-emptive strike. \r\nThat blackmailing and hostile policy of the United \r\nStates is continuing and increasing. The international \r\ncommunity has witnessed the opening of the largest-\r\never joint military exercises between the United States \r\nand South Korea — twice this year alone, in March and \r\nAugust, involving, respectively, 500,000 and 200,000 \r\ntroops and a massive build-up of whatsoever they have \r\nas nuclear weapons and their means of delivery.\r\nIn that situation, for self-defence, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has been compelled to \r\ndefend its sovereignty and prevent nuclear weapons \r\nfrom dropping onto the heads of its people. We have \r\nbeen compelled to have a nuclear deterrent.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the reference about a \r\nnuclear test this year and what he called a ballistic \r\nthe Union of South American Nations, the Common \r\nMarket of the South and Petrocaribe. All those are tools \r\nfor democratizing our societies that promote socially \r\ninclusive economic development and ensure political \r\nstability. Despite various internal disputes and conflicts \r\nbetween fraternal countries, we have been able to find \r\nmechanisms for the peaceful settlement of conflict. We \r\nhave demonstrated that without military intervention, \r\ndrones or economic blockades, we can build and \r\npreserve genuine democracy and move forward in \r\ncombating hunger, poverty and inequality.\r\nThe Venezuelan nation is proud of being part of a \r\nregion that is free of weapons of mass destruction. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to encouraging the complete \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons and chemical and \r\nbacteriological weapons as a way of ensuring that life \r\ncan continue on planet Earth.\r\nIn his various statements before the Assembly, \r\nCommander Chávez Frías called for improving the \r\nmeans for addressing problems and resolving conflicts \r\nin a transparent manner. He also pointed out that, in \r\nthe face of today’s reality, there was a crucial need \r\nto consider whether the Headquarters of the United \r\nNations should be here in this country where the \r\nGovernment does not respect the Organization, much \r\nless the sovereignty of each and every State Member. \r\nThe United Nations should be in a place where there \r\nis respect for all Members; where the political will \r\nf lourishes, without pressure or fear, to end conflict in \r\nthe world through dialogue; where the path forward \r\nis genuine social development and the elimination of \r\nhunger and poverty; and where what matters is how to \r\nstop war, not how to justify it.\r\nLet us take the United Nations to the South, where \r\nthe antithesis to exclusion — solidarity — has often \r\ntaught us that we are in fact all equal. For now, we \r\nwelcome the proposal of President Evo Morales Ayma \r\nthat we should meet in the Organization’s various other \r\nheadquarters in different parts of the world. Beyond the \r\nshadows that seem to darken the future of the human \r\nrace, from Latin America and the Caribbean we are \r\nsaying and showing that another world is possible \r\nwhere all of us can, in peace and dignity and with \r\njustice, enjoy lives worth living.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting.\r\n13-48796 21/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nWe showed maximum generosity in pushing ahead \r\nwith the declaration, thereby contributing to an easing \r\nof tension and moving towards a relaxation of tension \r\non the Korean peninsula. Afterwards, South Korea \r\nreturned to a confrontational approach by destroying \r\nand undermining that climate. In such a situation, we \r\nhave no other option but to establish a climate that \r\nwould be conducive to separated family reunions. \r\nThe 15 June joint declaration is the fundamental key \r\nto confidence-building, reconciliation, cooperation, \r\nunification and prosperity for the entire Korean nation, \r\nincluding both the north and south of Korea. That is the \r\nonly way forward to ease tension and for unification.\r\nI want to kindly recommend to South Korea that \r\nnothing can take the place of the joint declaration, which \r\nwas unanimously welcomed by the General Assembly \r\nresolution in the year 2000 (resolution 55/11).\r\nMr. Shin Dong-Ik (Republic of Korea): My \r\ndelegation would like to respond to the remarks made \r\nby the delegation of North Korea on several issues \r\nthat were covered by my delegation during the general \r\ndebate.\r\nFirst, on the issue of the nuclear programme, or \r\nmissile launch, North Korea claimed that there is \r\nanother part to the story on developing their nuclear \r\nprogramme. It has been made clear that there exist no \r\nnuclear weapons on our territory and that it remains \r\nour unchanged policy to observe and implement the \r\n1992 Joint Declaration on the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula, to which North Korea is also a party. \r\nNeedless to say, tension in the region has its roots in \r\nNorth Korea’s continued missile launch and nuclear \r\ntest. North Korea’s argument is nothing more than an \r\nirresponsible and ridiculous pretext for developing a \r\nnuclear programme.\r\nOn the claim that North Korea launched a satellite \r\nin December 2012, we would like to make it clear that \r\nthe United Nations Security Council resolutions 1718 \r\n(2006), 1874 (2009), 2087 (2013) and 2094 (2013), as \r\nwell as its relevant presidential statements, clearly \r\ndemand that North Korea not conduct any launch using \r\nballistic-missile technology. Given the track record \r\nof North Korea’s repeated nuclear tests and missile \r\nlaunches, North Korea has no justification for claiming \r\nany peaceful use of outer space.\r\nFurthermore, the argument of the North Korean \r\nrepresentative demonstrated that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has no intention of abiding \r\nmissile launch, I want to correct him when he said that \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had launched \r\na ballistic missile. It was a satellite launch and it was not \r\nthis year, but in December 2012. Again, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would like to clarify its \r\nposition that this was a satellite launch carried out in \r\nfull exercise of its sovereignty — its equal sovereignty \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations — and as a \r\nState party to the Outer Space Treaty. However, against \r\nthat fundamental principle of the Charter concerning \r\nrespect for sovereignty, the United States took the issue \r\nof the satellite launch to the Security Council, which \r\nadopted resolution 2087 (2013), and misled the world \r\nby saying that it was a ballistic missile. That was in \r\nf lagrant violation of sovereignty and an abuse of power \r\nby a so-called “permanent” member of the Security \r\nCouncil: the United States. That has undermined \r\ngreatly the credibility of the Security Council.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the reference concerning the \r\nobligation to implement Security Council resolutions \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, taking \r\nthe issue of the satellite launch to the Security Council \r\nhas demonstrated a double standard. The Council \r\nhas never taken issue with other satellite launches: \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has been \r\nthe only country. Again, as I said earlier, that is a \r\ndouble standard and an abuse of power. Therefore, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea totally rejected \r\nthat Security Council resolution as illegal and has never \r\nrecognized such resolutions.\r\nFourthly, with regard to giving up the simultaneous \r\ncarrying out of economic development and the build-\r\nup of nuclear armed forces, that is again a provocation \r\nagainst the strategic policy of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. It can never be a political bargaining \r\nchip. It is a policy within the security sphere of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to safeguard \r\npeace and security, and thereby ensure the environment \r\nfor peaceful economic development. That is an absolute \r\nguarantee for economic development.\r\nFifthly, he referred to the unilateral cancelling of \r\nseparated-family reunions. I want to correct his use of \r\nthe word “cancelled”. We did not cancel. We officially \r\nannounced that they would be postponed until an \r\nappropriate climate were established. What do we mean \r\nby that? There has been a very positive development \r\nwith the restarting of the Kaesong Industrial Complex in \r\nthe spirit of the 15 June joint declaration, which was the \r\noutcome document of the inter-Korean summit in 2000. \r\n22/23 13-48796\r\nA/68/PV.17 27/09/2013\r\nthe United States. I kindly ask the United States what is \r\nthe status of the nuclear weapons in South Korea in case \r\nthey are not there. The international norm is to get the \r\nverification of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\nand the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. The United States has a commitment, a legal \r\nobligation.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the resolution,  again I \r\nwant to tell a story. South Korea launched a satellite \r\nimmediately after the launch of that of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. But since it is the so-called \r\nally of the United States, the United States did not \r\ntake the issue to the Security Council. The delegation \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, in its \r\nfirst intervention in exercise of the right of reply, said \r\nthat that was a double standard. In the history of the \r\nSecurity Council, how can a satellite launch be a threat \r\nto peace and security? The mandate of the Council is \r\nnot to take up the issue of a peaceful satellite launch. \r\nSouth Korea launched, the international community \r\nquietly observed, and the Security Council kept silent.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the parallel policy of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, again he made \r\nthe provocation and, again, this cannot be a political \r\nbargaining chip. I make that very clear.\r\nFourthly, on family reunions, on the Korean \r\npeninsula, while the dialogue was going on, they \r\nopened a joint military exercise in August for almost \r\none month against the climate of the dialogue that had \r\nbeen going on. We showed our maximum restraint and \r\npatience, but they went ahead with the provocation of \r\narresting the political figures who favour unification in \r\nSouth Korea. They brought them to court, to so-called \r\njustice, saying they were pro-North Korea factors.\r\nOnce again, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea delegation would like to make clear that the \r\n15 June joint declaration should be given priority as the \r\nforemost political document and the only way and the \r\nfundamental key. South Korea should answer before the \r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Shin Dong-Ik (Republic of Korea): I will try \r\nnot to exceed the five-minute limit. Perhaps I will not \r\nneed that much time, as I do not feel any need to get \r\nentangled with his endless claims based on force and \r\nabsurd reasoning.\r\nNorth Korea again denied being bound by any of \r\nthe obligations by which the rest of the Member States \r\nby international norms. Article 25 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations provides that Member States agree \r\nto accept and carry out the decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil. Article 103 clearly states that in the event of a \r\nconflict between the obligations under the Charter and \r\nobligations under any other international agreement, \r\nthe obligations under the Charter prevail. North Korea \r\nis thus bound by its obligations under the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nOn the parallel policy of economic development \r\nand nuclear armament, the North Korean delegation \r\nprovided  the rationale for their policy. But let me point \r\nout that the pursuit of a nuclear-weapons programme is \r\na violation of the international norm. Given that North \r\nKorea receives assistance of more than $10 million \r\nannually from the United Nations alone, it is a great \r\npity that the North Korean authorities squander \r\nscarce resources on nuclear and missile development. \r\nWe believe that North Korea should use its limited \r\nresources to improve the lives of its people, rather \r\nthan waste them on proscribed activities of developing \r\nnuclear weapons and missile programmes.\r\nLastly, on the issue of the family reunions, I must say \r\nthat it is very regrettable that North Korea unilaterally \r\ncancelled the scheduled family reunions just four days \r\nbefore the event, which had been planned with purely \r\nhumanitarian intentions to help heal our people’s pain of \r\nseparation. North Korea’s cancellation of the reunion of \r\nseparated families has shattered hopes, in particular of \r\n200 separated families that were especially selected for \r\nthe occasion among 10 million divided people in Korea. \r\nThose families were eagerly anticipating meeting their \r\nestranged kin. We strongly urge North Korea to reverse \r\nits inhumane decision and proceed with the reunion of \r\nthe families, in order to help heal the wounds inflicted \r\non our people and soothe their anguish.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): I shall do my best not to go beyond the five \r\nminutes.\r\nThe South Korea representative has again made \r\nmisleading remarks. He talked of the nuclear weapons \r\nof somebody else. South Korea is under the nuclear \r\numbrella of the United States. It allowed nuclear weapons \r\ninto the Korean peninsula. That has been undermining \r\nthe peace and security of the Korean peninsula for six \r\ndecades. Concerning nuclear weapons, he did not say \r\nhow long they have been there. He just said they were \r\nnot there. He is not the owner of the nuclear weapons of \r\n13-48796 23/23\r\n27/09/2013 A/68/PV.17\r\nIt is highly regrettable that the North Korean \r\ndelegation has again repeated its irrational, false and \r\narbitrary allegations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.45 p.m.\r\nabide in a faithful and consistent manner. I must again \r\nrepeat that, according to Article 25 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, all Member States should accept and \r\ncarry out the decisions of the Security Council.\r\n"
