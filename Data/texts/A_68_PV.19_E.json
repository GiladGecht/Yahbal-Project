"The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Perry Gladstone Christie, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Finance of the \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance \r\nof the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Perry Gladstone Christie, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Finance of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Perry Gladstone Christie, M.P., and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Christie (Bahamas): Permit me to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the Assembly. \r\nAs a member of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \r\nthe Bahamas takes special pride in the election of one \r\nof our region’s own — the third such person to be so \r\nelected over the years. You may be assured of our full \r\nsupport as you attend to the duties of the high office \r\nto which you have been elected and for which you are, \r\nif I may say so, superbly qualified. We consider it a \r\nprivilege to extend Ambassador Paulette Bethel to your \r\noffice as Chef de Cabinet, and we wish her well as well.\r\nPermit me also to express my condolences and \r\nthose of the Bahamas to the President and people of \r\nKenya following the tragic attack on innocent civilians \r\nin Nairobi just last week.\r\nThis year we in the Bahamas are celebrating \r\nour fortieth year of independence. It is appropriate, \r\ntherefore, that we should pause today and look back to \r\n1973, when our nation was founded and our membership \r\nin the United Nations began. In addressing the General \r\nAssembly for the first time on 1 October 1973, our \r\nthen Prime Minister, Sir Lynden Pindling, spoke of \r\nour journey from the dehumanizing experiences of \r\nslavery and colonialism to the liberating achievements \r\nof freedom, majority rule and independence. He spoke, \r\ntoo, of the “perpetual interdependence of the big and \r\nthe small,” and the fervent wish of the Bahamian people \r\nto be neither “dominated nor coerced.” He also had this \r\nto say:\r\n“We have the means to give new hope to \r\nmankind, to create a stable international order \r\ndominated by total and absolute political and \r\neconomic self-determination and human and moral \r\nvalues which make human beings paramount, not \r\nthings or abstractions.” (A/PV.2135, para. 28)\r\nSir Lynden’s call for us to be faithful to the \r\nresponsibilities of our nationhood and world citizenship \r\nis as relevant and compelling today as it was when we \r\nwere welcomed into the family of the United Nations \r\n40 years ago. As the present Prime Minister of the \r\nBahamas, I have therefore come here today, on behalf \r\nof the people of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, to \r\nrenew our pledge to play our part to help make our planet \r\nthe place of peace and stability and of collaborative \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.19\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n19th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 28 September 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Some have used \r\ntheir power, either unilaterally or in small groups of \r\nhigh-powered nations, to impose their will, arguing that \r\nthere is something fundamentally immoral, something \r\nintrinsically sinister, about the accumulation of wealth \r\nin offshore jurisdictions.\r\nWe reject that premise and we criticize in the \r\nstrongest possible terms the efforts of some to maim and \r\ncripple, if not destroy, the offshore economies within \r\nour region. Ironically, the anti-money-laundering, \r\nanti-terrorism funding and anti-criminal regulatory \r\nregimes of many of our countries are far more robust and \r\ndemonstrably far more effective than the corresponding \r\nregulatory regimes in many of the same countries that \r\nare leading the fight against us.\r\nWe firmly believe that offshore financial services \r\ncan be responsibly operated and regulated. We believe \r\nthat the sector represents true tax competition and, in \r\nthe great majority of cases, that it affords an honest \r\nopportunity for families and individuals alike to \r\nprotect their privacy while accumulating lawfully \r\nearned capital for themselves and future generations. \r\nMoreover, the evidence is overwhelming that most of \r\nthe investment of that offshore wealth takes place in \r\nand generally benefits the developed world.\r\nUnilateralism and diplomacy by coercion are not \r\nthe way the world should be dealing with that issue. \r\nInstead, we need to challenge the United Nations to \r\ntake the lead in developing and refining multilateral \r\nglobal mechanisms for the governance of the offshore \r\nfinancial services sector — mechanisms that will meet \r\nthe legitimate demands of the developed world for \r\nthe protection of their fiscal systems and their need \r\nfor greater security, while at the same time allowing \r\noffshore financial-service economies to continue to \r\ngrow in an orderly and properly regulated way.\r\nLet us not forget that the destruction of those \r\noffshore financial-service economies will destabilize \r\nthe countries that depend upon them for their \r\nlivelihood. To destroy that sector in the Caribbean \r\nwould effectively cause tens of thousands of newly \r\nempowered middle-class citizens to slip back into \r\npoverty or to migrate to the developed world. The \r\nmiddle class of which I speak constitutes the anchor \r\nof social stability for the countries of our region. If it \r\nis taken away, social destabilization will emerge as a \r\nrisk of the most ominous kind. And should that risk \r\nendeavour and mutual support that it was intended to \r\nbe, and must be, for the good of all humankind.\r\nBut we need to ensure that such pledges are not just \r\nso many catchy phrases. We need to not only talk the talk \r\nbut walk the walk. We in the Bahamas are determined \r\nto do just that. That is why, to cite one very recent \r\nexample, my Minister of Social Development, Melanie \r\nGriffin, on Tuesday of this week here in New York, \r\nsigned the United Nations Convention on the Rights \r\nof Persons with Disabilites on behalf of the Bahamas. \r\nThis is an important step forward that we have taken, \r\nmarrying our rhetoric to our actions and synching our \r\ndomestic agenda with our international obligations. We \r\nintend to ratify the Convention in the shortest possible \r\ntime, and later this year we will introduce the necessary \r\nlegislation in our Parliament to protect the rights of the \r\ndisabled and to give full effect to our obligations under \r\nthe Convention. The end to discrimination against the \r\ndisabled in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is now \r\nclearly in sight. Indeed, it is now imminent.\r\nI would also submit today that we are all of us \r\nunder a moral obligation to ensure that the policies \r\nand aspirational goals that the General Assembly sets \r\nfor itself, and to which all Member States subscribe, \r\nare in fact reflected in the way that we govern our \r\nrespective nations internally and, to no less a degree, \r\nin the way that we interact with each other as Member \r\nStates in the international community. For example, we \r\ncannot, on the one hand, proclaim that we believe in \r\nfree trade, then implement policies that inevitably bring \r\nabout the destruction of agriculture as we know it in \r\nthe Caribbean, and, in response to the resulting moral \r\noutcry, simply shrug our shoulders and piously lament \r\nthat the old order changeth.\r\nWe have to become more conscious of the practical \r\noutcomes of what we do. Too often, in the headlong \r\nrush for change, we damage the vulnerable and the \r\nweak. We then make pledges to help but seldom live \r\nup to those pledges in any sustained way. We simply \r\ncannot build a credible new world order on the basis of \r\nsuch practices. They run completely counter to our lofty \r\npronouncements about the need for interconnectedness \r\nand mutual support in the pursuit of economic progress \r\nfor all the nations of the world, be they large or small, \r\ndeveloped or developing.\r\nWe see the same dynamic at work in the \r\nongoing economic aggression of many of the more \r\ndeveloped countries against small, offshore financial \r\n13-48809 3/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nAnother problem that is of special concern to us \r\nis the continuing influx of guns and the increase in \r\ngun-related criminality, not only in the Bahamas but \r\nthroughout the region. As a world community, there \r\nis, I am convinced, a great deal more that we can and \r\nshould be doing to fight that common menace.\r\nThe Bahamas has this year signed the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty, and we encourage all States that have \r\nnot already done so to sign the Treaty as well. And \r\nwe implore those countries that produce the guns that \r\nend up taking innocent lives and causing terror in our \r\ncommunities to become more proactive in controlling \r\nthe export of guns. We implore them to step up the \r\npolicing of their own borders against arms traffickers.\r\nWe therefore call for more robust surveillance and \r\nreconnaissance measures to be instituted. We already \r\nhave the experience of joint anti-drug operational \r\nactivities with the United States of America. However, \r\nmore resources ought to be employed in a region-wide \r\neffort to fight crime. In particular, we call for a massive \r\nincrease in joint tactical operations so that more air \r\nand maritime assets can be consistently deployed \r\nand the thousands of square miles that constitute the \r\nterritorial waters of Caribbean States can be more \r\neffectively patrolled. We in the Bahamas stand ready \r\nto play our part in those joint efforts, without which \r\nthe war on arms trafficking, human smuggling and the \r\ntransshipment of illicit drugs will never produce the \r\nvictory we all strive for.\r\nIn a recent talk that I gave to a meeting of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund that the Bahamas hosted \r\nfor the region, I made the point that we must all seek \r\nto mitigate the vulnerabilities of our small States in \r\nthe CARICOM region. Of particular concern in that \r\nregard is the fact that we have as yet been unable to \r\ndisabuse the international financial organizations of \r\ntheir conviction that gross domestic product per capita \r\nis by itself an accurate measure of the wealth of a nation \r\nor of its state of development.\r\nThe result of the continuing adherence to that \r\ndogma and the policies that have f lowed from it is \r\nthat the international financial assistance needs of \r\ncountries in our region are being erroneously assessed \r\nand misunderstood. I therefore again join all of those \r\ncalling for a revamping of the criteria in that regard \r\nso that the true financial assistance and development \r\nneeds of developing countries can be evaluated in a \r\nfairer and more balanced and pragmatic way.\r\nmaterialize, the developed world may well end up \r\nfinding that it has solved one problem only by creating \r\nan infinitely bigger one for itself.\r\nThe need for greater multilateralism is also evident \r\nin many of the other problems confronting the Bahamas \r\nand our region. A matter of the highest national priority \r\nfor us revolves around our ongoing problem with illegal \r\nmigration to our shores. We in the Bahamas suffer from \r\nthe illegal migration of tens of thousands of desperate \r\npeople from our sister Caribbean Community State \r\nof Haiti — an exodus undeniably driven by crushing \r\npoverty.\r\nWe also have a problem with illegal migration from \r\nother countries in the Caribbean, albeit to a much lesser \r\nextent. Of special note in that regard are migrants from \r\nCuba. We believe that the policies rooted in the Cold \r\nWar that largely account for that migration ought to be \r\nbrought into alignment with the realities of the modern \r\nera.\r\nOur archipelagic nation, though comparatively \r\nsmall in population, covers a vast area. With our \r\nhundreds of islands, the opportunities for illegal \r\nmigration are greatly multiplied. At a time when it is \r\nimperative that we invest in the education and health \r\nand future of our people, we are forced instead to devote \r\nan ever-growing share of our resources to the problems \r\nassociated with illegal migration.\r\nThe Bahamas, like the rest of the world, \r\nunderstandably places a great deal of emphasis on \r\nthe human rights of migrants, but we also believe that \r\nthere must be similar concerns for the ill-effects on \r\nmigrant-receiving States such as ours. In particular, \r\nwe are concerned about the increasingly unsustainable \r\ncosts that are being incurred and the resulting erosion \r\nin the quality of life for the citizenry of the Bahamas. \r\nOur country, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, \r\nsimply does not have the financial resources and \r\ninfrastructural capacity, much less the psychological \r\nstamina, to endure that dilemma indefinitely.\r\nThat should also remind us of the economic \r\ndisparities within our region and of the need to intensify \r\nglobal efforts to eliminate poverty and structural \r\nimbalances that impede economic growth within \r\ncertain segments and sections of the Caribbean. For \r\nas long as those disparities persist, illegal immigration \r\nto the shores of countries that are comparatively more \r\nprosperous will continue to grow.\r\n4/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince Haji \r\nAl-Muhtadee Billah, Crown Prince of  \r\nBrunei Darussalam\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee \r\nBillah, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah, \r\nCrown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nPrince Haji Al-Muhtadee Billah (Brunei \r\nDarussalam): On behalf of His Majesty the Sultan and \r\nthe people of Brunei Darussalam, I wish to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We thank our \r\nformer President, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his efforts and \r\ncontributions over the past year.\r\nLet me begin by expressing our sincere condolences \r\nto the Government and the people of Kenya and to the \r\nfamilies of the victims of the terrorist attack. Such an \r\nact deserves our condemnation. Our deepest sympathies \r\nalso go to those affected by the recent earthquake in \r\nPakistan. \r\nThirteen years ago before the Assembly, our \r\nleaders made a promise to our peoples to fulfil their \r\nhopes and expectations for a better life. This is why we \r\nsee the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as a \r\nhighly important global partnership. It has shown us \r\nthat progress can be made if we work together locally, \r\nregionally and internationally. I would therefore like to \r\nplace on record our expression of appreciation to our \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his predecessor, \r\nMr. Kofi Annan, for the support and commitment \r\nprovided by the United Nations to realize that historic \r\ninitiative.\r\nWe are now approaching the end of the 15-year \r\nperiod. Like many other nations, Brunei Darussalam \r\nhas been able to learn much from its experiences in \r\nimplementing the MDGs. We understand the high \r\nexpectations for all to do well. However, we need to \r\nconsider the problems that some Member States are \r\nstruggling with. Those include limitations to natural \r\nresources, political conflict, socioeconomic problems \r\nand natural disasters. That is why this year’s theme is \r\nso appropriate. It is focused on setting the stage. For \r\nAnother significant vulnerability for my country \r\nconcerns the environment and the need to address \r\ncomprehensively issues of climate change. The Bahamas \r\nis surrounded by the sea and is low-lying. Indeed, 80 per \r\ncent of the land mass of the Bahamas is less than five \r\nfeet above sea level. The implications of climate change \r\nand associated rises in sea level are therefore obvious \r\nfor my country and its people. I would submit that the \r\nworld, particularly the developed world, has a stake in \r\nresolving those issues, for while countries such as ours \r\nmay be the victims of climate change, we are not among \r\nthe countries that are, in fact, largely responsible for \r\nthe climate change that threatens our future and that of \r\nthe planet.\r\nIn the Bahamas, we are waging our own battles. We \r\nare putting our fiscal house in order. We are introducing \r\ninnovative tools to fight crime. We are training a new \r\ngeneration for twenty-first century jobs. We are creating \r\nnew partnerships to tackle our most pressing problems. \r\nWe are aggressively pursuing renewable energy. We \r\nare revamping and modernizing our structure of \r\ngovernance to make it more responsive to the needs of \r\nthe twenty-first century. And by the increased use of \r\nthe referendum machinery, we are demonstrating our \r\ncommitment to a deepening of our democracy. \r\nWe are a small country with strong convictions and \r\nbig ideas. But as we look beyond the borders of our \r\nnation and of the region to gaze upon the global scene, \r\nwe see much eloquence and many handshakes and the \r\nceremonial signing of one treaty after another. Rarely, \r\nhowever, do we see concrete steps or enforcement \r\nmechanisms with teeth. Ringing declarations have been \r\nmade from Rio to Copenhagen and beyond, and we are \r\nconstantly being challenged by our own citizens to \r\ndemonstrate to them that real and measurable progress \r\nis being achieved at the global level.\r\nWe need to see more courage, more leadership, more \r\nsustained action on the global stage. So as the leader \r\nof a small but proud nation, I take the opportunity to \r\nsay to the big and powerful nations: Find your courage \r\nbecause the hour grows late.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister of \r\nFinance of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Perry Gladstone Christie, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Finance of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n13-48809 5/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nevery Member to develop in its own way and to involve \r\nits people in that development, even beyond 2015. \r\nUnfortunately, the options open to some people are \r\nseverely limited. That is so when the basic, fundamental \r\nright of self-determination has been denied. We refer \r\nparticularly to the people of Palestine, whom we \r\nbelieve can attest to that. Their legitimate struggle for \r\na homeland of their own remains unresolved. Hence, \r\nwe support the calls of the international community for \r\nintensified efforts towards realizing this basic right, \r\nwhich we take for granted today.\r\nThe date of 29 November 2012 was indeed a \r\nmemorable day in the history of Palestine, when it was \r\naccorded observer State status in the United Nations \r\n(see A/67/PV.44). I would like once again to express \r\nour support for Palestine’s full membership and for its \r\npeople’s legitimate struggle to exercise their right to \r\ntheir own independent and sovereign State.\r\nThe worsening situation in Syria continues to be of \r\nserious concern. We join the international community \r\nin condemning the use of chemical weapons, which \r\nhas caused the loss of lives in that country. More \r\nimportantly, we support all efforts, particularly those \r\nof the United Nations, to find a peaceful solution to the \r\ncrisis. In that regard, we welcome the United States-\r\nRussia framework agreement for the elimination of \r\nSyrian chemical weapons and the recent adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013) on Syria.\r\nBefore I conclude, we would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General and all his staff, as well as the \r\nUnited Nations Volunteers, for their hard work. We \r\nhighly respect the peacekeepers for the sacrifices they \r\nhave made in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand stability. We hope that our efforts within various \r\nUnited Nations agencies and bodies will lead us to the \r\nfuture that we all want.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Haji Al-Muhtadee \r\nBillah, Crown Prince of Brunei Darussalam, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Vice Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic. \r\nus in Brunei Darussalam, it means having a national \r\nvision — Brunei Vision 2035 — that clearly provides \r\ndirection towards attaining a dynamic and sustainable \r\neconomy in the interests of our people.\r\nIn line with the Vision, we place great emphasis \r\non helping our younger generation realize their hopes. \r\nWe have done this by providing quality education, \r\nencouraging innovation and creating better job \r\nopportunities. We also do what we can to assist fellow \r\ndeveloping countries, either bilaterally or in partnership \r\nwith other countries and international organizations, \r\nin human resource development, offering scholarships \r\nto study in Brunei Darussalam and training under \r\ncommunity outreach programmes within the region. We \r\nhope that the people-to-people approach will promote \r\ncultural exchanges and understanding.\r\nAt the same time, our regional work has been \r\nstrongly influenced by other Member States’ efforts \r\nto achieve the MDGs. Within the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), we have an agreed \r\nplan to achieve an ASEAN community by 2015. Brunei \r\nDarussalam, as this year’s ASEAN Chairman, has \r\nchosen the theme “Our people, our future together”. \r\nIt signifies our people’s role in ASEAN’s community-\r\nbuilding efforts. In addition, we have also encouraged \r\nour member States to start working on an ASEAN \r\nplan beyond 2015, to further strengthen our mission \r\nin promoting peace, stability and prosperity. We will \r\nalso continue to work together to strategically position \r\nASEAN in the wider region and the world at large. \r\nIn that regard, we are pleased that Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon has accepted our invitation to \r\ncome to Brunei Darussalam for the fifth ASEAN-\r\nUnited Nations Summit. We look forward to sharing \r\nour views and experiences with him, and hope that will \r\nstrengthen cooperation between our Association and \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe are also encouraged by the recommendations \r\nput forward in the recent report of the High-level Panel \r\nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Agenda on how \r\nwe can better assist our people in their daily lives by \r\nproviding food security and quality education and \r\neradicating extreme poverty. Overall, the MDGs have \r\noffered us many lessons indeed, and now it is time for \r\nall of us to move forward. Regardless of the statistics \r\nof who has achieved the goals and who has not, we feel \r\nthat much has been attained through the very concept of \r\nthe MDGs. The Goals have opened up opportunities to \r\n6/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nstrengthen development cooperation based on sincere \r\nand mutual assistance for the benefit of all and for a \r\nsecure world. As the world today becomes increasingly \r\ninterdependent, no single country can thrive and \r\nsurvive without the engagement and cooperation of the \r\ninternational community. \r\nIn that context, global institutions such as the \r\nUnited Nations have an important duty to advocate \r\non behalf of international development cooperation. \r\nI commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ntireless efforts in promoting international cooperation, \r\nincluding between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations throughout the world, in a complex and \r\nchallenging global environment.\r\nA nation’s political stability and security are vital \r\nfactors for enabling an environment and conditions \r\nconducive to advancing sustainable development. \r\nHowever, many regions of the world are experiencing \r\nsocial unrest, political strife and military confrontation, \r\nwhich pose a major threat to global and regional peace \r\nand security. In that regard, we share the common \r\nconcern over the deteriorating situation in the Middle \r\nEast, which has lasted for years now. We call on all \r\nparties concerned to work together and to find a \r\npeaceful solution in order to save the lives of innocent \r\npeople. In that spirit, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic welcomes the agreement reached by Russia \r\nand the United States on Syria’s chemical weapons. \r\nThe international community must devote urgent \r\nattention to the issue of Palestine on the basis of the \r\nprinciple of creating the two independent States of \r\nPalestine and Israel living side by side in peace. In \r\nthat regard, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\ncommends the efforts of Israel and Palestine to resume \r\npeace negotiations, which mark an important milestone \r\nfor the promotion of peace in that region. \r\nThe unilateral embargo on the Republic of Cuba, \r\nan independent State, is unjust and contrary to \r\ninternational law, and has a severe negative impact on \r\nthe lives of the peace-loving Cuban people. Therefore, \r\nit is now time to put an end to the embargo.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has always \r\nattached great importance to creating a peaceful \r\nenvironment and to safeguarding political stability in \r\nthe interest of national development, with a view to \r\ngraduating from least-developed-country status. To that \r\nend, the Lao Government has made the utmost effort \r\nto pursue a consistent foreign policy and to promote \r\nMr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) \r\n(spoke in Lao; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, I sincerely congratulate you, Sir, \r\non your election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. I would like to assure you of \r\nour full support and cooperation in discharging your \r\nnoble duty. I would also like to commend Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić for his successful completion of his mandate as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession. \r\nThe Government of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic offers its condolences to the Government and \r\npeople of Kenya on the loss of life as a result of the \r\nterrorist attacks last week in Nairobi, and I join the \r\ninternational community in condemning that inhumane \r\nact.\r\nThe year 2013 marks a new turning point in \r\npromoting international cooperation for development \r\nand in addressing global poverty. At the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development held in \r\nBrazil in 2012, world leaders initiated an international \r\nconsultative process to chart a vision and concrete \r\naction for enhancing sustainable development in the \r\npost-2015 era. This clearly demonstrates that poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development remain our \r\noverriding priorities. \r\nIn recent decades, despite the tremendous efforts \r\nof the international community to achieve poverty \r\neradication and development targets, 1.2 billion poor \r\npeople — 22 per cent of the world population — still \r\nlive in poverty. In addition, the environment continues \r\nto be threatened and damaged, which has led to climate \r\nimbalance and the frequent recurrence of natural \r\ndisasters that were rarely seen in the past. Moreover, \r\npolitical and social unrest and armed conflicts continue \r\nto rage in different parts of the world with no sign of \r\nimminent resolution. Likewise, the global and regional \r\neconomic and financial crisis has intensified, with \r\nlong-term effects on developing countries, especially \r\nleast developed countries.\r\nThese situations in the development, political, \r\nsocioeconomic and environmental spheres continue \r\nto obstruct and impede all nations from attaining \r\nthe sustainable development goals, including the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Against that \r\nbackdrop, it is more crucial now than ever before for \r\nthe international community to redouble its efforts to \r\n13-48809 7/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nto express my deep gratitude to all friendly countries \r\nand the international community for their support and \r\nassistance to the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \r\nwhich led to the successful outcome of the Summit.\r\nDespite various achievements in its socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, as both a least developed and a landlocked \r\ncountry the Lao People’s Democratic Republic remains \r\nvulnerable and continues to face numerous challenges \r\nin its development and poverty-reduction efforts, as \r\nclearly reflected in the recent third national MDG \r\nprogress report, issued early this month. If it is to achieve \r\nall the MDGs, the country must continue to overcome \r\ndaunting challenges, such as child malnutrition, gender \r\ninequality in education and the impact of unexploded \r\nordnance contamination. Nevertheless, the Lao \r\nGovernment will continue to lead its people in moving \r\nahead together with the international community in \r\ntackling numerous challenges in order to achieve the \r\nMDGs.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic is among \r\nthose countries most affected by cluster munitions and \r\nunexploded ordnance, which continue to pose major \r\nconstraints to national socioeconomic development \r\nand poverty reduction. In that regard, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic calls on all countries to consider \r\nacceding to the Convention on Cluster Munitions with \r\na view to ensuring a total ban on those weapons and to \r\nhelping to address the impact of cluster munitions.\r\nIn 2014, the group of landlocked developing countries \r\n(LLDCs) will hold a 10-year Review Conference on the \r\nImplementation of the Almaty Programme of Action to \r\naddress the particular problems and special needs of \r\nthe LLDCs. Adressing the specific problems of LLDCs \r\nhas become a regional and international obligation. \r\nRegardless of their development level, these countries \r\nwill not be able to address the impacts of their landlocked \r\ncondition without international cooperation, especially \r\nfrom transit countries and development partners.\r\nIn that context, the 2014 Review Conference will \r\nbe of great importance not only for the LLDCs, but \r\nalso for all development partners. The Conference will \r\nprovide an excellent opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to identify the emerging challenges and \r\nengage in new cooperation aimed at addressing the \r\nimpact of the landlocked status faced by the LLDCs. \r\nWe have high hopes and expectations for the outcome \r\nof the Conference, which could adopt a new policy \r\ndirection and more concrete measures reflecting the \r\ninternational cooperation at all levels. We continue to \r\nfulfil our international obligations to maintain peace \r\nand to promote the rule of law attentively. \r\nIn this regard, the Lao Government has mapped \r\nout a policy for governing the State by the rule of law \r\nand the promotion and protection of the fundamental \r\nrights of people of all backgrounds. The Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic is party to many international \r\nhuman rights instruments. We have enacted and \r\namended a national law on human rights, including the \r\nrights of women and children.\r\nTo continue fulfilling its international obligations, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has presented \r\nits candidatures for membership of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for the term of 2016-2018, and of the Executive \r\nBoard of the United Nations Development Programme/\r\nUnited Nations Population Fund/United Nations Office \r\nfor Project Services for 2016-2018. We hope that the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic will be given an \r\nopportunity to work with the international community \r\nwithin the aforementioned frameworks.\r\nAt the regional level, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic has played an active part in the process of \r\ncommunity-building of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), which consists of three \r\npillars: the political-security community, the economic \r\ncommunity and the sociocultural community. We \r\nbelieve that the political and economic strength of \r\nthe ASEAN community will form a solid ground for \r\nregional cooperation, thereby contributing to the \r\nmaintenance and promotion of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment in the region and the world at large.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic played an \r\nimportant role as Chair of the framework of cooperation \r\nbetween the continents of Asia and Europe — the Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting (ASEM) — from 2010 to 2012, and \r\nwas greatly honoured to host the ninth ASEM Summit \r\non 5 and 6 November in Vientiane, under the theme \r\n“Friends for peace, partners for prosperity”, which was \r\nsuccessfully concluded. At the Summit, leaders from \r\nthe two continents had a constructive exchange of views \r\non the ways and means to promote peace and enhance \r\ndevelopment cooperation in their respective regions \r\nfor the benefits of the peoples of Asia and Europe, as \r\nwell as to ensure their legitimate rights to live in peace \r\nand to improve their well-being. The Lao Government \r\nwas proud to have been given the opportunity to fulfil \r\nthat important obligation, and I take this opportunity \r\n8/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nits responsibilities and meeting the aspirations and \r\nexpectations of the peoples of the world. The resolution \r\nbuilds on the vital breakthrough achieved by the United \r\nStates and Russia in agreeing to a framework for the \r\ncomplete elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons. Full \r\ncompliance by the Syrian regime with its obligations \r\nis imperative. Ireland has already pledged €200,000 in \r\nfunding to support the vital role of the Organization for \r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, assisted by the \r\nUnited Nations, in implementing those arrangements.\r\nCrucially, the Security Council has called for \r\nthe early convening of an international conference to \r\naddress all aspects of the conflict. The inescapable \r\nreality is that the crisis can be resolved only politically, \r\nnot militarily. I am greatly encouraged by the \r\nindications that the “Geneva II” conference could be \r\nheld within a matter of weeks. Peace can come only \r\nthrough all Syrians engaging in a genuinely inclusive \r\nprocess aimed at agreeing a new political dispensation \r\nin their country.\r\nThe Security Council has expressed its conviction \r\nthat there must also be accountability for what has \r\noccurred in Syria. The International Criminal Court \r\nexists precisely for that purpose. We owe it to the Syrian \r\npeople to ensure that those responsible for the war \r\ncrimes committed against them are brought to justice. \r\nThere is also an urgent need to remove impediments \r\nto the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Violence \r\nagainst civilians must cease. All parties must facilitate \r\nunimpeded access to people in need throughout Syria \r\nand guarantee the safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel who perform their duties at enormous \r\npersonal risk.\r\nThe humanitarian efforts being made by Syria’s \r\nneighbours, including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, \r\nare remarkable and deserve far more support from the \r\ninternational community. We should not underestimate \r\nthe strain being imposed on those countries and the \r\nthreats being posed to refugee populations. Ireland has \r\ncontributed $15 million to the humanitarian operation, \r\nand we stand ready to do more within our means.\r\nElsewhere in the Middle East, we also see the \r\nprospect of progress. In Ireland, we know what it takes \r\nto make peace after a protracted conflict. I want to \r\nacknowledge the work being done in the current direct \r\ntalks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, \r\nwhich all who wish for peace must welcome. I want \r\nto commend in particular the determination and \r\ncurrent development environment. This could form the \r\nbasis for addressing the specific problems faced by the \r\nLLDCs in the next decade. \r\nThe success of the Conference would certainly \r\ndemonstrate the spirit of genuine partnership and \r\nmutual assistance among members of the international \r\ncommunity. Therefore, in my capacity as chair of the \r\ngroup of LLDCs, I call on all parties, international \r\norganizations — including the United Nations \r\nsystem — international financial institutions, the \r\nprivate sector and non-governmental organizations to \r\nparticipate actively in the preparation and organization \r\nof the Conference in view of ensuring its successful \r\noutcome.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Eamon Gilmore, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of Ireland.\r\nMr. Gilmore (Ireland): Every day, the peoples of \r\nthe world whom we are privileged to represent in the \r\nGeneral Assembly look on in helpless horror at the \r\nslaughter in Syria. They can see gassed children lined \r\nout, dead, on their television screens. They can access \r\nonline the facts about the 100,000 Syrians who have \r\nbeen killed; the 4 million who have been displaced; \r\nand the 2 million or more who have been driven into \r\nrefugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.\r\nThe peoples who have sent us, Government leaders \r\nand diplomats, to speak for them in this Hall are \r\nasking, “Why can we not stop this slaughter and this \r\nsuffering?” They see the conflict in real time. It is not \r\ntaking place in a remote part of the planet. Its brutality \r\nis made more visible by modern technology. The utterly \r\ncallous attack in Ghouta on 21 August marked a new \r\nlow in the endless litany of horrors.\r\nFrom the very outset, Ireland has consistently \r\nargued that the United Nations and the Security Council \r\nmust be central to any efforts to resolve the crisis and \r\nensure that international law and basic human rights \r\nare upheld. And while it has taken much longer than we \r\nwould all have wished, I welcome the decisive action \r\nthe Security Council has now taken on Syria.\r\nMr. Sinhaseni (Thailand), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013) marks a \r\nwatershed in the international community’s engagement \r\non the crisis. It offers renewed hope and confidence \r\nthat the United Nations is capable of discharging \r\n13-48809 9/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\ntimes the entire population of Ireland — are living in \r\nextreme poverty and hunger. Every single day, 18,000 \r\nchildren die needlessly from preventable causes in the \r\npoorest and least developed regions of the world; 7,000 \r\nof them are children under the age of 5, who die because \r\nthey are undernourished. One in every four children is \r\nstunted, most of them in the poorest countries. And \r\nevery day, 800 women die because of complications \r\nduring pregnancy and childbirth, for basic reasons that \r\ncould have been prevented. \r\nReversing those trends and creating a better future \r\nfor the countless millions of impoverished people on \r\nour planet is, perhaps, the greatest moral and practical \r\nchallenge we face today. We can, of course, draw \r\ninspiration and hope from our successes. And there \r\nhave been successes. Thirteen years ago, at the United \r\nNations, world leaders committed to taking tangible, \r\nmeasurable action to tackle global poverty. Huge \r\nprogress has been made since then under the framework \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nSignificant numbers of people have been lifted out of \r\npoverty. Millions of children are receiving primary \r\neducation. Two billion people have access to improved \r\nwater supplies, and HIV/AIDS and other diseases and \r\npandemics are being tackled.\r\nNevertheless, fresh global challenges, such as \r\nclimate change, are beginning to undermine the \r\nprogress made. Communities in developing countries \r\nthat have contributed least to the causes of climate \r\nchange are suffering most from its effects. That is \r\nan injustice — clear and simple. It is a matter of \r\nfundamental human rights and equity. And it is critical \r\nfor the future of all of our children, in a world which is \r\nreaching the limits of environmental sustainability, that \r\nthis injustice be reversed.\r\nI had the privilege of taking part in this week’s \r\nspecial event on the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand co-chairing one of the round-table sessions. \r\nIreland is proud to have co-facilitated the special event \r\nwith South Africa and to have achieved an outcome \r\ndocument that will guide negotiations over the next two \r\nyears on completing the MDGs and crafting the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nI believe that when world leaders gather at the \r\nUnited Nations in 2015, we can and should be ready \r\nto adopt a new set of global goals aimed at achieving a \r\nsustainable, just and secure world for the future. I want \r\nto see a clear commitment to ending extreme poverty \r\nengagement of United States Secretary of State John \r\nKerry, who has done so much to bring that about, and \r\nthe leadership of President Abbas and Prime Minister \r\nNetanyahu, who have had to accept difficult choices to \r\nbegin the process of negotiation. We all know, and they \r\nknow, that many more difficult choices lie before them \r\nif they are to succeed and to secure a comprehensive \r\npeace settlement. They deserve all our support.\r\nWe are also encouraged by the stated determination \r\nof the new Iranian Government to address the \r\nconcerns of the international community and build \r\nconfidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its \r\nnuclear programme. We look forward to Iran’s serious \r\nengagement in meaningful negotiations, leading to full \r\ncompliance with all of its international obligations, and \r\nhope that that will also contribute to the creation of a \r\npositive dynamic in the Middle East region.\r\nIreland currently participates in seven United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions, including each of \r\nthe three missions in the Middle East. In response to \r\na request of the Secretary-General, we are deploying \r\nIrish personnel to reinforce the United Nations \r\nDisengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan \r\nHeights. We are doing so to help ensure that UNDOF \r\ncan continue to implement its mandate at a difficult \r\ntime. Ireland’s deployment to that challenging mission \r\nis a signal of our deep commitment to the peacekeeping \r\nrole of the United Nations. The Irish people are rightly \r\nproud of these soldiers and of the record of our Defence \r\nForces, members of our police service and Irish civilians \r\ndeployed in the cause of peace.\r\nI join other speakers at this rostrum in condemning \r\nthe recent attack in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, which \r\nleft dozens of innocent people dead and almost 200 \r\ninjured. It was a chilling reminder that well-organized \r\nand ruthless international terrorist groups and networks \r\nare constantly searching for new locations and targets \r\nfor atrocities. My profound sympathy and that of the \r\npeople of Ireland go out to the victims of the attack and \r\ntheir families. We must be vigilant against terror and \r\nresolute in refusing to compromise our values in the \r\nface of such threats.\r\nMany factors contribute to human suffering. \r\nViolent conflict, such as that in Syria, is one — and \r\nthe toll of casualties there is escalating daily. But there \r\nare many parts of the world where underdevelopment, \r\nmalnutrition and disease exact an even greater toll. \r\nAround the globe, 870 million people — almost 200 \r\n10/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nIreland is a small State that is deeply committed to \r\nthe United Nations and to the principles enshrined in \r\nits Charter. We are proud to contribute to the important \r\nefforts of the United Nations in peacekeeping, in conflict \r\nresolution, in development aid and in humanitarian \r\naction. There can be no doubt that the United Nations \r\nis the unique and indispensable forum where the \r\npeoples of the world share their collective concerns and \r\ndetermine to take action to make the world a better and \r\na safer place.\r\nThe membership of this Organization has \r\nconferred primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security on the Security \r\nCouncil. Accordingly, we look to the Council to \r\nshow leadership in response to international crises. \r\nMembership of the Council is a privilege for any State, \r\nand Ireland has been honoured to serve on it on a \r\nnumber of occasions. \r\nBut the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil have a special responsibility to work together \r\nin a way that enables the United Nations to live up \r\nto the commitments made in its Charter. When the \r\nUnited Nations fails, or delays action, we are all the \r\npoorer for such setbacks. But when the United Nations \r\nworks, we can achieve great things together. And \r\nthose successes, such as the definition of a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, should serve as an inspiration \r\nand a springboard for the international community’s \r\nresponses to the other great challenges of our time.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Surapong Tovichakchaikul, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Kingdom of Thailand.\r\nMr. Tovichakchaikul (Thailand): On behalf of \r\nthe delegation of the Kingdom of Thailand, allow me \r\nto congratulate the Honourable Mr. John Ashe on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-eighth session. My delegation stands ready to \r\nrender our full support and cooperation.\r\nI would also like to express our appreciation \r\nto the outgoing President, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his \r\nexceptional leadership during the previous session. \r\nI am particularly grateful for his contributions to the \r\nsecond Asia-Pacific Water Summit, held in Chiang \r\nMai, Thailand, earlier this year.\r\nThailand is committed to the United Nations. \r\nOur faith in the principles and values it stands for has \r\nnever wavered. The United Nations three pillars of \r\nsecurity, development and human rights continue to \r\nand hunger in a generation. I want to see specific \r\ncommitments in relation to the empowerment of women \r\nand girls. And I want to see an integrated approach on \r\nclimate change and a strong focus on climate-sensitive \r\nagriculture.\r\nIn our own aid programme, my Government \r\nhas prioritized hunger and malnutrition, a theme \r\nthat resonates with Ireland’s own history. We have \r\na very simple message about the vital importance of \r\ninvestment in nutrition for mothers and babies. We \r\nare leading supporters of the Scaling Up Nutrition \r\nmovement, and we are committed to doubling our aid \r\nspending on nutrition by 2016.\r\nIreland is today emerging from several years of an \r\neconomic crisis that will soon be behind us. After many \r\ntough decisions and a lot of hard work, we are about \r\nto safely exit an international bailout and our economy \r\nis back on track. I am proud to say that despite the \r\nextremely difficult circumstances many Irish people \r\nfind themselves in, we have sustained our commitment \r\nto the provision of development aid. I know that we are \r\nready to play our part in a new global partnership, and \r\nthat it is only through this body, the United Nations, \r\nthat it can be achieved.\r\nIt is a matter of great pride to my country that \r\nIreland was last year elected for the first time to the \r\nHuman Rights Council. I warmly thank the Member \r\nStates for their support in the election and the \r\nconfidence they have placed in us. Ireland played a lead \r\nrole in the adoption of two important resolutions by the \r\nHuman Rights Council this week — one on preventable \r\nmortality of children under five; the other recognizing \r\nthe important role played by civil society at the local, \r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nadopted by the Assembly states that recognition of the \r\ninherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights \r\nof all members of the human family is the foundation of \r\nfreedom, justice and peace in the world. It also states that \r\nthose human rights should be protected in law. Today, \r\ninstead of offering protection, we increasingly see \r\nlegal measures being adopted to discriminate against \r\npeople on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender \r\nidentity. I welcome the courageous leadership shown \r\nby the Secretary-General when he promised in April to \r\nlead a global campaign for lesbian, gay, bisexual and \r\ntransgender rights. Ireland pledges its full support to \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General, both here in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and in the Human Rights Council.\r\n13-48809 11/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\njust when action is most needed. Overcoming deadlock \r\nand achieving consensus must be a central objective of \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe United Nations is, of course, much more than the \r\nSecurity Council. Unity and consensus are also needed \r\non development. Thailand believes that sustainable \r\ndevelopment must be at the heart of the United Nations \r\nagenda. The world has made great strides in tackling \r\npoverty and hunger, thanks in no small part to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), but all of \r\nus still need to make a final push on the MDGs. That \r\nwould enable us to tackle the deep-rooted poverty that \r\nstill aff licts the so-called bottom billion.\r\nFollowing the MDGs, the post-2015 development \r\nagenda must provide both continuity and a new source \r\nof hope. To build on the MDGs, Thailand believes \r\nthat we should place special emphasis on the needs of \r\nthe most vulnerable countries. That includes conflict \r\nand post-conflict societies, as well as those of least \r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \r\nand small island developing States. If we fail to do so, \r\nmillions will be left behind.\r\nThe most pressing challenge to sustainable \r\ndevelopment that demands our concerted action is \r\nclimate change. For a number of countries, particularly \r\nsmall island developing States, climate change strikes \r\nat the very heart of survival. For much of the world, \r\nclimate change is also linked to another important \r\nchallenge — food security. Extreme weather can cause \r\ngreat damage to agriculture. The impact will be felt \r\nnot only in food-producing countries, but worldwide. \r\nThat is why we need to work together to put in place \r\nsystems — better weather prediction technology, \r\nbetter storage silos and more resilient strains of staple \r\ncrops — that will mitigate the impact of climate change. \r\nThose are areas where countries should help one another \r\nby sharing their experiences and know-how. \r\nThailand believes that, if development is to be \r\nsustainable, it must be people-centred. We welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report “A life of dignity for \r\nall: accelerating progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and advancing the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015” (A/68/202), which \r\nputs people at the centre of the development agenda. \r\nPeople need to be given the chance and the tools to \r\nmake the most of their potential. This can happen if we \r\ninspire and motivate us. When the 50 founding States \r\ncame together in San Francisco in 1945, the world had \r\nhigh hopes for the United Nations. The United Nations \r\nwas created in response to the demands of a different \r\ntime, after millions of lives had been lost in a conflict \r\nbetween States. Today, it is conflict within States that \r\ntakes the heaviest human toll, as we have witnessed in \r\nthe unfolding events in Syria.\r\nAs we look ahead to the post-2015 future, we must \r\nnot shy away from asking the hard questions. We must \r\nask ourselves whether multilateralism has lived up to our \r\nexpectations, be it in security, trade or the environment. \r\nWe must ask how we Member States can do better in the \r\nface of critical challenges. That is because ultimately, \r\nthe success of the United Nations depends on all of us. \r\nWith such a diversity of viewpoints, it is all the more \r\nimportant for us to work together to find the unity and \r\nconsensus we need. \r\nThe challenges facing us are particularly clear \r\nin the case of Syria. On 21 August, we learned that \r\nchemical weapons had been used against innocent \r\ncivilians in Syria. Despite widespread condemnation \r\nand outrage, the United Nations was initially unable \r\nto act and the Security Council was deadlocked. We \r\ntherefore welcome resolution 2118 (2013) on Syria, \r\nadopted yesterday by the Security Council. We urge \r\nSyria to ensure the full and effective implementation of \r\nthe resolution, and to allow monitoring and enforcement \r\nby the international community. It is our hope that the \r\nSecurity Council, especially its permanent members, \r\nwill continue to work to find a durable political solution \r\nfor the sake of the Syrian people.\r\nIn setting the stage for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, we must recognize that development cannot \r\ntake root without peace, security, democracy and \r\nhuman rights. The three pillars of the United Nations \r\nmust be developed together and nurtured together. To \r\nstrengthen the United Nations, we need to seek ways to \r\nachieve unity and consensus on the issues that matter \r\nmost. In the area of security, this means thinking of \r\nnew, creative ways to respond to the changing threats. \r\nFor instance, when States fail to protect their own \r\npopulations, or even cause them harm, all our words \r\nwill amount to little unless matched with action.\r\nBut what kind of action would make the most \r\ndifference on the ground? When and how is it most \r\neffective? There are no simple answers. It is on such \r\nissues that the world looks to the Security Council for \r\nleadership. Too often, however, the Council is paralysed \r\n12/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nSoutheast Asian Nations is strengthening its partnership \r\nto become a community of over 600 million people by \r\nthe end of 2015. Regional discussions on the post-2015 \r\nagenda are also complementing ongoing global efforts. \r\nAs a moderate, medium-sized country with an open \r\nsociety, Thailand is ready to work with all countries \r\nand partners. We want to do our part in helping \r\nbridge the gaps in communication, understanding and \r\nopportunity.\r\nThat is why we have put forward our candidacies to \r\nthe Security Council for the term 2017-2018 and to the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the term 2015-2017. We are \r\nkeen to help build bridges to connect all stakeholders \r\nin a more cohesive, action-oriented global partnership. \r\nBuilding a global partnership means forging a common \r\nagenda for action on our most important challenges. It \r\nmeans reaching out beyond our borders, beyond our \r\nregion and beyond our comfort zone.\r\nThailand has been building bridges not only within \r\nAsia, but also with Africa and Latin America. We \r\nbelieve that developing countries everywhere need \r\nto come together in a spirit of partnership to make \r\ntheir voices heard. What is more, that same sense of \r\npartnership must also cross the development divide, \r\nembracing developed and developing economies alike.\r\nSince the beginning, the United Nations has been \r\na force for good. As its membership has grown and \r\nthe issues have become more complex, we have now \r\nreached a crossroads. Whether the United Nations takes \r\nthe right path rests on our ability to achieve consensus \r\nand to act together in a meaningful manner. Now is \r\nthe time for us to set aside our outdated assumptions \r\nand our differences. Our common future depends on \r\nour ability to come together to forge consensus on the \r\nnew realities before us. The way forward is not through \r\npolitics as usual, but through constructive dialogue and \r\nmutual respect. With goodwill and common purpose, \r\nthe international community can once again rise to the \r\nchallenge. Together, we can fulfil the promise of the \r\nOrganization and the loftiest goals toward which we, \r\nthe Member States, have always aspired.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Manasseh Maelanga, Deputy Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands.\r\nMr. Maelanga (Solomon Islands): It is with much \r\npride that the Government and the people of the Solomon \r\nIslands join me in congratulating a fellow islander, \r\nAmbassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, on \r\nfocus more on promoting human security, for instance \r\nthrough education and health care. On education, we \r\nbelieve that the Secretary-General’s Global Education \r\nFirst Initiative is an important contribution to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda and deserves the support of \r\nall stakeholders. Health is also very much a development \r\nissue. When people are unhealthy, it imposes a cost on \r\nState finances and can even undo development gains.\r\nAs we look to the post-20l5 future, we must not \r\nlimit our goals to specific health challenges. We should \r\nnow set our sights on the more general objective of \r\nuniversal health care. Initiated by the administration \r\nof former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra 10 years \r\nago, Thailand has been implementing a programme \r\nthat charges only $1 per doctor’s visit. This universal \r\nhealth-care scheme is universal in its coverage of \r\ntreatments, ranging from common illnesses and \r\nchronic diseases to lifesaving surgeries. Statistics have \r\nshown that through this programme, around 300,000 \r\nhouseholds have been saved from falling into poverty. \r\nEven non-Thai nationals, especially migrant workers \r\nfrom neighbouring countries are also benefiting from \r\nuniversal health care, making it truly universal. \r\nThe socioeconomic impact of this programme has \r\ntherefore been tremendous. Those who benefit most \r\nfrom our universal health care have been the poor \r\nand the vulnerable. By working to empower the most \r\nvulnerable among us, we ensure that development \r\nis more inclusive. We believe that the model could \r\nbe adapted to other developing countries, and we are \r\nwilling to share the lessons we have learned from our \r\nexperience.\r\nWe also believe that women, children, the elderly \r\nand persons with disabilities must be treated fairly and \r\nencouraged to participate fully in all aspects of life. \r\nParticularly in situations of conflict, vulnerable groups \r\nare often at the greatest risk of violence. We therefore \r\nsupport the United Nations initiative to end sexual \r\nviolence in conflict. We also commend the United \r\nKingdom for its leadership in realizing the Declaration \r\nof Commitment on this important issue.\r\nTo provide an environment that facilitates unity \r\nand consensus, the international community must \r\nalso forge a new global partnership. This new global \r\npartnership must rest on a common agenda for action. It \r\nwill need to involve States — in particular like-minded \r\nStates — the United Nations, regional organizations, \r\ncivil society and other stakeholders. In South-East \r\nAsia, the process is well under way. The Association of \r\n13-48809 13/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\npeople, half of whom live in least developed countries, \r\nhave no access to electricity. The Istanbul Programme \r\nof Action recognizes that access to affordable, reliable, \r\nrenewable energy is crucial to accelerating sustainable, \r\ninclusive economic growth, increased social equity and \r\na sustainable and clean environment.\r\nExpanding energy access for our rural populations \r\nand reducing energy costs are national priorities \r\nfor Solomon Islands. I am pleased to announce that \r\nSolomon Islands joined the International Renewable \r\nEnergy Agency (IRENA) last month. We hope to work \r\nwith IRENA in unlocking some of our hydroenergy \r\npotential. I am pleased to say that we already have a \r\nworking relationship with the World Bank and the Asian \r\nDevelopment Bank on hydro-projects. We are also in \r\ndiscussion with the Clinton Foundation on harvesting \r\nour geothermal potential. Once that gets off the ground, \r\nit will be a private-public sector partnership. Bilaterally \r\na number of partners, including the Republic of China, \r\nItaly and Japan, have people-centred solar programmes \r\nin the country. Those programmes continue to light up \r\nour community schools and villages. Renewable energy \r\nalso improves public service delivery to our rural \r\npopulations and empowers Solomon Islanders to make \r\nsustainable choices in life.\r\nGlobally, the Pacific SIDS are themselves helping \r\nto fill the information gaps in global renewable energy \r\ndatabases, in cases where information on the Pacific \r\nis lacking. A Pacific renewable energy database will \r\nbe developed in cooperation with the United Nations \r\nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific. The vision is to focus on enhancing the \r\nPacific region’s inclusion in the international energy \r\ndialogue and to provide sufficient data to inspire new \r\nglobal partners to concentrate more on on-the-ground \r\ninvestments, less on studies.\r\nInfrastructure development is critical in opening \r\nmore opportunities for our rural populations. We \r\nacknowledge New Zealand for the construction of \r\nour second international airport and other partners, \r\nsuch as Australia and the European Union, for the \r\nwharves, airfields and roads they have helped to build. \r\nThose structural investments allow Solomon Islands \r\nto enhance its trade and strengthen the unity of the \r\ncountry.\r\nClimate change remains a global issue that needs \r\na global solution. We join all small island developing \r\nStates and least developed countries in conveying our \r\nconcern about the slow progress of climate change \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-eighth session. As one of his Vice-Presidents, we \r\nassure him of Solomon Islands’ support and cooperation \r\nduring his tenure in office.\r\nI take this opportunity to commend his predecessor, \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić of Serbia, whose leadership guided us \r\nthrough over 300 resolutions, the adoption of the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty and the convening of a number of high-\r\nlevel thematic debates. Solomon Islands also wishes \r\nto acknowledge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis service and commitment to our global world. I \r\nwould also like to welcome Kiribati, whose permanent \r\nrepresentation in New York completes the Pacific small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) presence in a single \r\ncity.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the sixty-eighth session’s \r\ntheme, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the \r\nstage”. The world has changed since the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were launched. \r\nPopulations have grown, cities have expanded, and \r\nconsumption and production patterns have pushed us \r\nto our planetary boundaries. Solomon Islands’ MDG \r\nnational scorecard remains mixed. We have progressed \r\non some fronts and remain off track on others.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda offers us \r\nan opportunity to change the way we do business. \r\nIn that regard, Solomon Islands seeks a new spirit \r\nof partnership that will reform the global economic \r\narchitecture. My subregion in the Pacific supplies \r\n60 per cent of the world’s tuna. Over three decades, the \r\nPacific Islands have developed fisheries institutions and \r\nlegal and management frameworks. With international \r\nsupport, we can supply the world with fish. Solomon \r\nIslands, as Chair of the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries \r\nAgency and of the parties to the Nauru Agreement, \r\ncalls for a new mindset that would provide the Pacific \r\nIsland States with the space and capacity to develop its \r\ndomestic industries and restructure the fishing f leets of \r\ndistant-water nations in the region.\r\nThe Pacific Fisheries Vessel Day Scheme has \r\nallowed us to realize our development aspirations. Two \r\nnew fishing industries have established themselves this \r\nyear in Solomon Islands. We remain firm in our resolve \r\nthat the Scheme shall remain the central pillar in all our \r\nfisheries negotiations.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the President’s proposal \r\nof convening a third thematic debate on sustainable \r\nenergy during this session. We note that 1.3 billion \r\n14/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nIslands Development Forum intends to speak with a \r\nunited voice in the High-level Political Forum. Pacific \r\nSIDS look forward to working with the Forum.\r\nI am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands \r\nbegan a new journey two months ago. The 10-year-old \r\nPacific Islands Forum Regional Assistance Mission \r\nto the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) — led by Australia \r\nand supported by New Zealand and Pacific small \r\nisland developing States — went through a transitional \r\nphase. RAMSI, provided for under Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, now provides only \r\npolice assistance. The success of the transitional phase \r\nbelongs to our people and our region. On that note, I \r\ntake this opportunity, on behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of Solomon Islands, to express our \r\nprofound gratitude and appreciation to all our regional \r\nneighbours. We thank them very much.\r\nMultilateralism remains a cornerstone of Solomon \r\nIslands’ foreign policy. Country ownership remains a \r\nfoundation of any cooperation and programme. This \r\nyear, under United Nations Development Programme \r\nleadership, the United Nations Development Assistance \r\nFramework for the Pacific (2013-2017) was launched. \r\nThe $292 million programme covers 14 Pacific \r\ncountries and territories, all with the same priorities. \r\nWe call on the United Nations to align itself with \r\nSolomon Islands national sustainable development \r\nstrategy 2011–2020. It is for that reason that over the \r\nyears we have called for an enhanced United Nations \r\ncountry presence. We renew the call to upgrade the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme country \r\noffice from the level of deputy resident representative \r\nto that of resident representative.\r\nA peaceful, just and stable democracy is critical for \r\nsustainable development. Solomon Islands continues \r\nto invest in strengthening its governance system. A \r\npolitical party integrity bill is being introduced in \r\nour national Parliament. The political party bill aims \r\nto give more power to our electoral commission to \r\nproperly manage our national election process. We \r\nare also putting in place a sustainable, cost-effective \r\nand inclusive voting registration system. That is an \r\nexpensive exercise; we have sought partnership with \r\nthe United Nations, the European Union and Australia. \r\nWe thank our partners for their ongoing support to \r\nour electoral reform programme. That assistance \r\ncomplements work done on e-governance. Solomon \r\nIslands this year established a metro area network as \r\na single secure network connecting 85 Government \r\nnegotiations. The alarming pace of climate change is \r\nposing unprecedented threats to humankind’s survival. \r\nIn May, carbon dioxide concentration reached a \r\nnew threshold of 400 parts per million. For Solomon \r\nIslands, this means that the livelihood and well-being \r\nof our people are now under threat. Corals stop growing \r\nat 500 parts per million.\r\nWe are heartened by the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposal to convene a climate change summit next year. \r\nWe hope that the summit will not be a talkfest, but that it \r\nwill garner the necessary political will of Member States \r\nto increase their level of commitment to reducing and \r\nphasing down greenhouse-gas pollution commensurate \r\nwith scientific guidelines. The summit remains our best \r\nhope for preventing the impact of climate change from \r\nreaching an irreversible level. We once again register \r\nour regret that certain countries have reneged on their \r\nhistorical responsibility and unilaterally decided to opt \r\nout of their multilateral obligations.\r\nThe world will celebrate 2014 as the International \r\nYear of Small Island Developing States. The SIDS \r\nconference is scheduled to be held in Samoa next \r\nyear. We count on the world to enable small island \r\ndeveloping States to eradicate poverty, build resilience \r\nand unleash the potential of our youths. That will \r\nrequire the enhanced implementation of the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for \r\nImplementation towards an evidenced-based outcome.\r\nIn seeking a sustainable future for our people, last \r\nyear we announced that we would establish a national \r\nuniversity. I am pleased to say that we launched \r\nSolomon Islands National University in April. A \r\nsecond university, the University of the South Pacific, \r\nhas also completed all formalities and is expected to \r\nbegin the construction of its fourth campus in one of \r\nour provinces. The development of human capital will \r\nallow Solomon Islands to build a knowledge-based \r\nsociety and have more job-ready nationals to meet our \r\ndevelopment needs.\r\nThis week the international community convened \r\nthe first inaugural meeting of the High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development. In preparation for \r\nthe Forum, the Pacific small island developing States \r\nformed the Pacific Islands Development Forum this \r\nyear. Solomon Islands is one of the founding members \r\nof the Forum, an alliance of States and non-State and \r\nprivate-sector actors that focus on the green economy \r\nin the context of sustainable development. The Pacific \r\n13-48809 15/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nIn my subregion, the Melanesian Spearhead \r\nGroup — composed of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu \r\nand Solomon Islands — represents one of the most \r\ndiverse regions of the world. A quarter of the world’s \r\nlanguages are spoken by the more than 8 million people \r\nof the subregion. Enhanced free trade has unified the \r\nculturally rich diverse populations. Today, the Group \r\nis exploring other economic, security and political \r\ncooperation.\r\nOn Fiji, Solomon Islands welcomes the progress \r\nput in place by the Government of Fiji for the people \r\nto freely express themselves through the parliamentary \r\nelections scheduled for 2014. Solomon Islands notes \r\nthe adoption of Fiji’s new Constitution and wishes \r\nthe Government and people of Fiji every success in \r\ndetermining their own future.\r\nThe inalienable right to self-determination is a \r\nkey pillar of the United Nations. With respect to New \r\nCaledonia, members of the Melanesian Spearhead Group \r\ncontinue to support the Territory’s self-determination \r\nprocess in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the relevant human rights instruments and the \r\nNoumea Accord. In regard to the Territory of French \r\nPolynesia, I take this opportunity to thank the General \r\nAssembly and all Pacific small island developing States \r\nfor adopting by consensus resolution 67/265, on the \r\nself-determination of French Polynesia in May. The \r\nquestions of the Territories of French Polynesia and \r\nNew Caledonia are scheduled to be discussed by the \r\nFourth Committee next week.\r\nOn human rights, Solomon Islands recognizes \r\nthat all States bear the responsibility to protect their \r\ncitizens. We believe that all States must take feasible \r\nsteps to ensure that the rights of their people are \r\nprotected. Solomon Islands, in that regard, condemns \r\nall human rights violations against civilians, wherever \r\nthey may occur.\r\nOn the Middle East, we continue to watch with horror \r\nthe daily carnage and the humanitarian catastrophe in \r\nSyria. We note with concern the preliminary findings \r\nof the United Nations investigation team confirming the \r\nuse of chemical weapons. Solomon Islands welcomes \r\nthe Russian and United States initiatives to destroy \r\nchemical weapons in Syria, and further supports all \r\nefforts to find a diplomatic and political solution to the \r\ncivil war.\r\noffices. We hope that will improve the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of the Government’s computer machinery.\r\nSolomon Islands would like to see a strong United \r\nNations. We are encouraged by the Assembly’s \r\ncommitment to achieving real progress on reforming \r\nand revitalizing two of our principal organs, the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. We assure \r\nthe Assembly of our support on those two endeavours.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the modernization of \r\nthe Secretariat Building and the conference rooms and \r\nthe renovation of the General Assembly. We are also \r\npleased to note that United Nations competitive exams \r\nwill be held in my capital in the next two months. We \r\nare holding the exams for the third consecutive year. \r\nI thank the Secretariat, and in particular the United \r\nNations human resources personnel, for their outreach, \r\nand sincerely hope the nationals selected will contribute \r\nto the diversity of the Secretariat.\r\nChanging global realities have seen the emergence \r\nand expansion of South-South cooperation. This year, \r\nSolomon Islands established two new diplomatic \r\nmissions in Cuba and Malaysia, respectively. On \r\n18 April, Solomon Islands raised its f lag in Havana. We \r\nalso welcomed Cuba as a Pacific Islands Forum post-\r\nforum dialogue partner three weeks ago. Similarly, in \r\nMalaysia last month the first resident Solomon Islands \r\nAmbassador presented his credentials. We intend to \r\nstrengthen our ties with the wider Asian and Pacific \r\nregion, including the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations and India. We have some 100 medical students \r\nin Cuba; the first graduates are expected in 2014. We \r\nthank Cuba for its cooperation.\r\nFor more than two decades, the General Assembly \r\nhas called overwhelmingly for the lifting of the more \r\nthan five-decades-old economic blockade imposed on \r\nCuba by our friend and partner the United States of \r\nAmerica. Confrontational lines will need to be replaced \r\nwith dialogue and cooperation. We cannot look to the \r\nfuture if we cling to the past. We hope that a forward-\r\nlooking policy will be embraced by the United States of \r\nAmerica in easing the blockade.\r\nI turn now to bilateral cooperation with Papua New \r\nGuinea, my Melanesian neighbour. Papua New Guinea \r\ncontinues to provide opportunities for young Solomon \r\nIslanders in terms of employment and scholarships. \r\nVisa-free work schemes have been launched, and trade \r\nrelations continue to grow to new heights.\r\n16/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\none set of goals, under a single process with common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities. Present and future \r\ngenerations depend on what we do today.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Vete Sakaio, Deputy Prime Minister of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Sakaio (Tuvalu): It is a great honour and \r\npleasure to participate in the sixty-eighth session of \r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the people and \r\nthe Government of Tuvalu. At the outset, I would like \r\nto congratulate the President on his new leadership \r\nresponsibilities; he has all the blessings and support \r\nof Tuvalu. I also wish to thank and acknowledge with \r\nprofound appreciation the outgoing President and the \r\ncontinued assistance and support given by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, the specialized organizations \r\nand their respective heads and staff. We are particularly \r\ngrateful for our membership in the United Nations \r\nfollowing a successful sixty-seventh session.\r\nThe new Government of Tuvalu, of which I am \r\nhonoured to be Deputy Prime Minister, was elected \r\ntwo months ago. Just last week, the Government, in \r\ncooperation with development partners, launched a \r\nroad map committing to mutual partnerships that will \r\ndeliver and make a difference for the people of Tuvalu. \r\nThe road map focuses on improving the delivery of vital \r\nbasic services, strengthening good governance and \r\nenhancing local capacity to address Tuvalu’s unique \r\nvulnerabilities and respond effectively to the impacts \r\nof climate change.\r\nIt is visionary and timely to focus our debate on the \r\ntheme of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage” as we approach the end of a journey called \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are \r\nnow ready to chart a new path, which we are calling \r\nthe sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the post-\r\n2015 agenda. And as we do every fall, we have gathered \r\nto reaffirm our spirit for and commitment to a renewed \r\nmultilateralism and genuine collective action and to \r\nreflect, assess, address and plan for how to realize the \r\nCharter’s principles of peace, justice, human rights, \r\nsocial progress and equal opportunity for all.\r\nHowever, our global efforts cannot be fully universal \r\nuntil the United Nations pragmatically recognizes the \r\ninternational contribution that the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan has made and the responsibility it has undertaken \r\nto achieve the noble goals of the United Nations, as well \r\nas the MDGs and SDGs, thus improving the standards \r\nof living of millions all over the world. The Republic \r\nOn Israel and Palestine, we support all international \r\nefforts for the two States to resume negotiations and \r\nachieve a just, lasting and sustainable peace.\r\nSolomon Islands remains an arms-free State. We \r\nnote that the use of conventional and unconventional \r\narms in the wrong hands threatens international peace \r\nand stability. Solomon Islands welcomes the recently \r\nadopted Arms Trade Treaty and hopes that major \r\nplayers in the arms trade will sign that international \r\nframework. That will strengthen the Treaty. Solomon \r\nIslands continues to follow and assess the Treaty’s \r\nprogress.\r\nOn the question of the Republic of China, Solomon \r\nIslands call for the Republic’s meaningful participation \r\nat United Nations specialized organizations. We would \r\nlike to acknowledge the Republic of China’s recent \r\nparticipation in the Assembly of the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as a guest of the \r\norganization’s President. We recognize that as a first \r\nstep. We continue to seek observer status for the \r\nRepublic of China both at ICAO and at the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nThose requests mirror the observer status that the \r\nRepublic of China currently enjoys at the World Health \r\nAssembly.\r\nSolomon Islands continues to serve on the United \r\nNations Executive Board. We welcome the new \r\nExecutive Director of UN-Women, Ms. Phumzile \r\nMlambo-Ngcuka, and assure her of our cooperation. \r\nWe note with concern that the UN-Women strategic \r\nplan for 2014-2017 is underfunded. We call for political \r\nand financial support for the plan. We support the \r\nExecutive Director’s call that priority be given to the \r\neconomic empowerment of women in rural areas. \r\nWe hope the Executive Board can also address UN-\r\nWomen’s representation vacuum in the Pacific. \r\nGender violence remains an issue in Solomon \r\nIslands, and my country joins the international \r\ncommunity in condemning sexual violence.\r\nWe continue to seek an inclusive society. In \r\npartnership with an Australian entity, Solomon Islands \r\norganized national games for persons with disabilities \r\nin our country and other events. Although we still \r\nhave a long way to go in creating a disability-friendly \r\nsociety, we remain determined to achieve that end.\r\nLet me close where I began. The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda is our shared agenda. We must \r\nremain united and work as one, with one aim, to deliver \r\n13-48809 17/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nnot poverty; progress, not setbacks and regression; and \r\nempowerment, not constraint.\r\nLet me reflect on Tuvalu’s performance with \r\nrespect to the MDGs as the deadline 2015 draws near. \r\nI am pleased to report that Tuvalu has made significant \r\nprogress towards the achievement of its MDGs, despite \r\nthe impact of the various global financial and economic \r\ncrises on its small, vulnerable economy. In the 2012 \r\nMDG progress report, Tuvalu was assessed as being \r\non track with respect to four of the MDGs: primary \r\neducation, child mortality, maternal health and global \r\npartnership; as having the potential to achieve three \r\nMDG targets: gender equality, combating HIV/AIDS, \r\nand environmental sustainability; and as being unlikely \r\nto achieve the MDG on poverty.\r\nThe attainment of the MDG on poverty is a \r\nformidable challenge for the fourth-smallest country in \r\nthe world. Tuvalu is poorly endowed in terms of natural \r\nresources and has almost no productive capacity. Tuvalu \r\nis highly dependent on aid, leasing gratuities and rental \r\nincomes derived from its national assets — air, sea \r\nand its domain — and remittances. We will continue \r\nto seek the invaluable support and cooperation of the \r\nUnited Nations and the donor community in our pursuit \r\nof attaining the MDG on poverty as we approach 2015.\r\nGender equality and the empowerment of women \r\nand youth is pursued at all levels of decision-making. In \r\n2012, Tuvalu adopted a family protection bill that aims \r\nat safeguarding our women and girls against sexual and \r\ngender-based violence, domestic violence and rape. The \r\nbill has facilitated access to justice and improved the \r\nprovision of services to women and girls who have been \r\nsubject to discrimination and violence, whether in the \r\npublic or the private sphere.\r\nTuvalu is also fully committed to the strategic \r\nimplementation of the outcomes of the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy \r\nfor the Further Implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction for the Sustainable Development of Small Island \r\nDeveloping States. As we approach the International \r\nYear of Small Island Developing States, in 2014, and \r\nthe third International Conference on Small Island \r\nDeveloping States in Apia, Samoa, we urge the United \r\nNations to ensure that SIDS status and SIDS-specific \r\nrecognition are truly sanctioned in the Organization’s \r\nbureaucracy. We have seen enough General Assembly \r\nresolutions that address SIDS issues in a vague \r\nand abstract way, and yet the entire United Nations \r\nof China’s significant international participation in \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies, including in \r\nthe World Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF, \r\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization, the \r\nInternational Maritime Organization and the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nis critical as we collectively advance towards the \r\npost-MDG era and enter the era of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. \r\nTuvalu also fully supports the lifting of the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. That will allow the Republic of Cuba to \r\nfurther consolidate and enhance its cooperation with \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) like Tuvalu.\r\nLooking back at our MDG journey, we have come \r\nacross a myriad of crises and challenges, both natural \r\nand man-made. We know where we have come from, \r\nwe know our capacities and constraints in facing those \r\ncrises and challenges, and we know the direction we are \r\nheading in. We give great attention to how to address \r\nthe many persistent and ongoing issues in their entirety \r\nand in their many forms, as we approach the finish line \r\nfor the MDGs.\r\nAs we make the transition to the SDG stage and the \r\npost-2015 agenda, we take heed of the intrinsic lessons \r\nfrom the MDGs. First, the United Nations continues to \r\nbe a beacon of hope and, through strategic advocacy \r\nand awareness campaigns, the Organization brings the \r\nreal issues and current events into the consciousness \r\nof both the public and the membership in order to \r\npropel action and redress. Secondly, partnership is \r\nkey to the success of this truly universal Organization. \r\nWorking together cooperatively delivers much more \r\nthat we can make happen on our own. Cooperation \r\nand collaboration with communities, businesses, think \r\ntanks, churches, philanthropists, regional groupings \r\nand not least each United Nations Member, reaffirms \r\na true and sustainable union that should constitute the \r\nway forward for the SDGs.\r\nThe United Nations Charter should be mirrored in \r\nour national goals and priorities. Our vision for the new \r\nSDGs and post-2015 agenda must reflect a membership \r\nthat is striving for the same goals — a world that \r\nembodies peace, not conflicts and terrorism; hope, \r\nnot despair; opportunities, jobs and prospects for a \r\ndecent life, not unemployment and welfare dependence; \r\nsecurity and freedom, not insecurity and totalitarianism; \r\nequality, not autocracy; unity, not divisiveness; good \r\ngovernance and leadership, not tyranny; sufficiency, \r\n18/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\ncontribution, however minuscule, to global efforts to \r\ncut greenhouse-gas emissions. If we SIDS in the Pacific \r\ncan do it, surely others can, too. \r\nThe world must save Tuvalu and the SIDS in \r\norder to save the whole planet. We urge perseverance, \r\nwith the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the Kyoto Protocol as the primary \r\ninternational and intergovernmental instruments for \r\nnegotiating the global response to climate change. \r\nWe call on all parties to work diligently to reach a \r\nlegally binding framework for curbing greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions at the upcoming nineteenth session of the \r\nUnited Nations Climate Change Conference, in Warsaw. \r\nThe framework should also include mechanisms \r\ndealing with climate-change-related loss, damages \r\nand insurance for SIDS, and should provide adequate \r\nand accessible financing for adaptation support to \r\nSIDS such as Tuvalu. Tuvalu also applauds and fully \r\nsupports the leadership of the Secretary-General and \r\nhis commitment to hosting a climate change summit \r\nnext year.\r\nFor Tuvalu, the climate change issue is \r\npredominantly linked to the oceans. For a nation \r\nsurrounded by seas, an ocean SDG is pertinent, for \r\nobvious reasons. Seventy per cent of the planet’s \r\nsurface is covered by oceans, which are the cornerstone \r\nof Earth’s life support system. The uncontrolled and \r\nincreasing carbonization of our oceans and their \r\nbiodiversity are genuine issues of concern and must \r\nbe urgently addressed. At the same time, radioactive \r\nspillovers of land-based nuclear wastes into the oceans, \r\nespecially those that have followed recent incidents, \r\nmust be dealt with properly and prevented from \r\nhappening again. Here, the principle that the polluter \r\npays should be the basis for efforts to clean, mitigate \r\nand prevent contamination of the oceans.\r\nTuvalu is currently heavily dependent on \r\nimported fuel and petroleum products for electricity \r\ngeneration and transportation requirements. That will \r\ncontinue in both the short and medium term. Many \r\nrecommendations for alternative energy sources and \r\ntechnologies, whether solar, wind or wave, have been \r\nproposed but not fully implemented. Our energy sector \r\nhas set itself the challenge of becoming 100 per cent \r\nrenewable by 2020. We appreciate the support of the \r\nmany donors we have had for alternative renewable \r\nsources of energy, assistance with formulating energy \r\npolicy and promoting efficient energy sources. Science \r\nand technological capacity in Tuvalu also remain \r\ndevelopment agenda includes no specific treatment of \r\nSIDS. The 2014 SIDS Conference must be decisive on \r\nestablishing special windows for partnerships on SIDS \r\nthat are designed to ensure not only their sustainable \r\ndevelopment but also their long-term security and \r\nsurvival.\r\nTuvalu appreciates the decision of the Economic \r\nand Social Council to defer consideration of Tuvalu’s \r\ngraduation from the least developed country (LDC) \r\ncategory under the Istanbul Programme of Action for \r\nthe Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-\r\n2020. That said, however, Tuvalu humbly submits that \r\nwhile the threshold criteria of LDC graduation — the \r\nhuman development index, per capita gross national \r\nincome and the economic vulnerability index — are \r\nwell established, it would simply be irrational and \r\nirresponsible if application of any two of the three \r\ncriteria was the only measure of consideration for \r\ngraduation. Given Tuvalu’s extreme vulnerability \r\nas a SIDS, we believe that our failure to achieve a \r\nsatisfactory EVI level carries more weight for us in \r\nconsidering our possible graduation from the LDC list.\r\nClimate change and sea-level rise have had dire \r\nconsequences for Tuvalu’s situation. Our survival and \r\nsecurity, and our children’s future livelihood, have \r\nbeen seriously compromised by the international \r\ncommunity’s inaction on climate change. The fifth \r\nassessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change, Climate Change 2013: The Physical \r\nScience Basis, has further confirmed to the world the \r\nstark predictions for SIDS like Tuvalu in the wake of \r\nclimate change and sea-level rise. The challenge we \r\nput to the Assembly is, What else are we waiting for? \r\nWhat is the relevance of talking about post-MDGs \r\nand SDGs when the world continues to fail in its duty \r\nand obligations to urgently reduce greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions and provide genuine adaptation? Ensuring \r\nTuvalu’s long-term security means saving the whole \r\nworld.\r\nClimate change is no longer an environmental \r\nor political issue. It is a borderless security issue for \r\nhumankind. Everyone must act to urgently reduce \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions and provide adaptation. \r\nAmong the papers distributed to the Assembly is the \r\n2013 Pacific Islands Forum Communiqué, which \r\ncontains the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership, \r\nwhich Tuvalu strongly supports. Through the Majuro \r\nDeclaration, the Pacific island leaders commit their \r\nfull responsibility and leadership to making their own \r\n13-48809 19/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nimplementing the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe world economic and financial crises are partially \r\nresponsible for our straying from the charted path. \r\nHowever, they brought to light some of the underlying \r\nissues that had either been overlooked or underestimated \r\nand which turned out to be important for the overall \r\nsuccess. \r\nWe are all aware that, in the context of \r\ninterdependence and the growing interconnectedness \r\nof the world economy, no country can achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in isolation. The \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nenriched our understanding of the ways of achieving \r\nthe overall progress towards the political, social and \r\neconomic development.\r\nArmenia welcomes the inclusion of “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage” as the main \r\ntheme of our deliberations in the current session.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nDespite the fact that most of us share the \r\nunderstanding that the elimination of violence and \r\nterror is essential for building peaceful, sustainable and \r\nprosperous societies, peace seems to remain an elusive \r\nphenomenon in many parts of the world. \r\nArmenia remains alarmed by the worsening of the \r\nhumanitarian situation in Syria. The number of refugees \r\nArmenia continues to receive already exceeds 10,000, \r\nbut tens of thousands of Syrian-Armenians remain in \r\nSyria, a country that had become their second home \r\nafter the genocide of 1915, and they are struggling for \r\ntheir survival in unbearable conditions together with \r\ntheir fellow Syrians.\r\nArmenia welcomes the unanimous adoption \r\nyesterday of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), \r\nbased on the agreement reached in Geneva between \r\nRussian Foreign Minister Lavrov and United States \r\nSecretary of State Kerry. The resolution could lead to \r\nthe elimination of chemical weapons and the exclusion \r\nof their use in Syria and pave the way for a political \r\nsolution of the Syrian crisis, putting an end to the \r\nsuffering of the Syrian people.\r\nIt is our strong belief that there is no alternative \r\nto the peaceful solution of conflicts. The resolution \r\nof conflicts requires political will and determination. \r\nThree months ago, on 18 June the Presidents of the \r\nthree co-Chair countries of the Minsk Group of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nunderdeveloped, and we need relevant and simple \r\ntechnologies that can be made readily available and \r\npriced effectively, especially for LDCs and SIDS. The \r\nfacilitative role of the United Nations as a repository \r\nof such technologies and practices within the \r\nOrganization’s networks and websites will prove highly \r\nbeneficial.\r\nFinally, as we approach the end of the MDGs \r\nand embrace the SDGs, we must pay attention to \r\nthe nations with special needs, the poorest and most \r\nvulnerable, in making every effort to meet the MDGs \r\nand achieve a smooth transition to the SDGs. The scale \r\nof the challenges can be addressed only by reforming \r\nourselves — the United Nations and each Member \r\ncountry. Delivering on the future we need and on \r\nour sustainable goals, delivering more and delivering \r\nbetter, will require increasing doses of great effort \r\nand discipline, perseverance and courage, tolerance \r\nand harmonious coexistence, multilateralism and \r\ninterdependence on the part of us, the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn a couple of days, Tuvalu will celebrate its thirty-\r\nfifth year of independence. Can we tell our children \r\nand grandchildren a story of continued survival on \r\nour God-given peaceful islands? Or do we have to tell \r\nthem that the world, under the United Nations, that \r\nnoble body, can no longer save their future because of \r\nclimate change and sea-level rise? As with great pride \r\nwe celebrate the continuing vibrancy of democracy \r\nand the rule of law, and our political independence in \r\nTuvalu, we also appeal to the world. Please save Tuvalu \r\nfrom climate change. Let the world save Tuvalu in order \r\nto save itself.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Edward Nalbandyan, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Nalbandyan (Armenia) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nMr. John William Ashe on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to \r\nthank the outgoing President, Mr. Vuk Jeremić.\r\nDuring the past two decades, the international \r\ncommunity has made great strides towards the \r\ndevelopment of a cohesive approach aimed at \r\naddressing the political, social and economic \r\nchallenges that the international community is facing \r\ntoday. We need to analyse our commitments, keeping \r\nin mind the difficulties that we have encountered while \r\n20/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nthe three permanent members of the Security Council, \r\nhave never made another reference to those resolutions.\r\nAzerbaijan is acting as if the international \r\ncommunity shared its approach and as if it shared \r\nthe approach of the international community. In \r\nreality, Azerbaijan continuously rejects all proposals \r\nof the internationally mandated OSCE Minsk Group \r\nco-Chair countries. Baku has rejected all versions of \r\nthe Basic Principles of the settlement of the Nagorno \r\nKarabakh conflict proposed by the co-Chairs of the \r\nOSCE Minsk Group, including those presented at \r\nthe Kazan, Sochi, Astrakhan and Saint Petersburg \r\nsummits. Baku refuses not only the Basic Principles, \r\nbut also the confidence-building measures proposed \r\nby the co-Chairs on consolidation of the ceasefire, \r\nwithdrawal of the snipers from the line of contact and \r\nthe establishment of a mechanism for investigating \r\nceasefire violations. Azerbaijan not only obstructs \r\nconfidence-building measures, but also periodically \r\norganizes provocations on the line of contact with \r\nNagorno Karabakh and on the border with Armenia, \r\nwhich has resulted in new casualties.\r\nAt the previous session of the General Assembly \r\n(see A/67/PV.19), I spoke about the Azerbaijani \r\nleadership’s release and glorification of an axe-murderer \r\nnamed Ramil Safarov, which was strongly condemned \r\nby the entire international community and by the \r\nhuman rights commissions of the United Nations and \r\nother international organizations. Even today, more \r\nthan a year after Safarov’s release, the Azerbaijani \r\nleadership continues to declare that what they did is \r\njust and right and dares to criticize the stance of the \r\ninternational community. That clearly demonstrates the \r\ndeepening gap between the Azerbaijani leadership and \r\nthe international community in terms of perceptions of \r\nwhat is good and what is bad.\r\nMost recently, Azerbaijani authorities at the \r\nnational level have ostracized the eminent Azerbaijani \r\nwriter Akram Aylisli for publishing a novel in which he \r\ntalks about the pogroms against Armenians in Baku, \r\nSumgait and other parts of Azerbaijan. Aylisli’s books \r\nwere publicly burned, and the writer had to leave the \r\ncountry after receiving death threats.\r\nJust last week the Azerbaijani leadership once \r\nagain came up with new threats against Armenia and \r\nNagorno Karabakh and made claims to Armenian \r\nterritories, including its nearly 3,000-year-old capital \r\ncity, Yerevan. Notwithstanding Azerbaijan’s destructive \r\n(OSCE) — Russia, United States and France — made a \r\nnew statement on Nagorno Karabakh in the framework \r\nof the Group of Eight Summit in Enniskillen. \r\nIn Armenia, we welcomed that statement and \r\naffirmed that, like the co-Chairs, we continued to \r\nbelieve that the elements outlined in the statements of \r\nthe Heads of State of the co-Chair countries over the \r\npast five years can form the basis for reaching a fair and \r\nlasting settlement of the conflict. We share the position \r\nof the co-Chair countries that those elements should \r\nbe seen as an integrated whole and that any attempt \r\nto select some elements over others would make it \r\nimpossible to achieve a solution. We absolutely agree \r\nthat peoples should be prepared for peace, not war. \r\nUnfortunately, to date the Azerbaijani leadership has \r\nbeen doing just the opposite, increasing warmongering \r\nand anti-Armenian hate speech on a daily basis, even \r\nusing the lofty rostrum of the United Nations for its \r\npurposes.\r\nWe absolutely agree with the Heads of the three \r\nco-Chair countries — which are also three permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council — that the use of force \r\nwill not resolve the conflict and that only a negotiated \r\nsettlement can lead to peace and stability. However, \r\nthrough its unprecedented accumulation of offensive \r\nweaponry at a massive scale, Azerbaijan seriously \r\nendangers regional and international security, despite \r\nits membership in the Security Council.\r\nUnlike Azerbaijan, Armenia has on several \r\noccasions reiterated its commitment to the principles \r\nof international law and, in response to the Enniskillen \r\nappeal of the Presidents of the United States, the Russian \r\nFederation and France, once again reaffirmed that \r\ncommitment, particularly with respect to the non-use \r\nof force or the threat of force, equal rights and the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples and territorial integrity.\r\nAzerbaijan keeps misinterpreting the 1993 \r\nresolutions of the Security Council — resolutions 822 \r\n(1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) — the \r\ncore requirement of which was the immediate cessation \r\nof all hostilities and hostile acts and the establishment \r\nof a durable ceasefire. Azerbaijan has not only failed \r\nto comply with the latter requirement, but further \r\nintensified its aggression and the military operations \r\nagainst Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia using \r\nmercenaries closely linked to notorious terrorist \r\norganizations. It is not surprising that since the \r\nceasefire agreement was signed in 1994, the mediators, \r\n13-48809 21/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\ncongratulations to the President on the occasion of \r\nhis election to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-eighth session. I am convinced that he will \r\nspare no effort to strengthen the gains made and to \r\nfirmly establish international peace and security, so \r\nas to create an international system in which all of \r\nmankind enjoys well-being, stability and progress. The \r\nPresident’s experience and political skills in heading \r\nhis country’s Mission for over a decade are also factors \r\nthat make him a natural leader during this session.\r\nI should also like to praise the efforts of his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, and commend him for \r\nhis interest in the problems of the African continent and \r\nhis efforts to strengthen the principle of dialogue as an \r\neffective tool for consultation and the role of the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance.\r\nI would also like to thank the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his unflagging efforts in the \r\nservice of international peace and security and his \r\nfocus on climate change issues and the fight against \r\nfamine and deadly diseases, as well as on realizing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nLast June, in the important speech that the \r\nPresident delivered to the General Assembly on the \r\noccasion of his election to preside over the sixty-eighth \r\nsession (see A/67/PV.87), he outlined his ambitious \r\nprogramme of action, which takes into account the \r\nparticipation of women, youth and civil society in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, the role of South-\r\nSouth cooperation, the role of human rights and the \r\nrule of law, and the role of information technology and \r\ncommunication in the proposed development agenda. \r\nThose are important topics, and we thank him for \r\nincluding them.\r\nOver the past two decades — in step with the Human \r\nDevelopment Report — some developing countries have \r\nexperienced substantial economic change. However, the \r\nmajority of developing countries, especially the least \r\ndeveloped ones, remain very far from achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. On the threshold \r\nof 2015, it behoves us today to implement plans and \r\nprogrammes that take into consideration the failures \r\nof the past and the challenges of the future and to \r\neffectively prepare the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nIn that regard, we call upon the wealthy countries \r\nof the world to live up to their promises regarding \r\nthe financing of development programmes in those \r\ndeveloping countries that have such pressing needs. \r\nstance, Armenia will continue to make efforts towards \r\nthe settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \r\nexclusively through peaceful means and on the basis \r\nof the purposes and principles and norms set forth in \r\nthe United Nations Charter and the provisions of the \r\nstatements made by the Presidents of the three co-Chair \r\ncountries’ at L’Aquila, Muskoka, Deauville, Los Cabos \r\nand Enniskillen.\r\nIn March, the Human Rights Council adopted \r\nby consensus a resolution initiated by Armenia and \r\nco-sponsored by over 60 countries on the prevention \r\nof genocide. The recognition, condemnation and \r\nprevention of genocide remain a priority for Armenia, \r\nand we will take the necessary actions to prevent new \r\noccurrences of the crime of genocide, while keeping the \r\nissue of responsibility for crimes against humanity and \r\nthe denial thereof high on its agenda. As the nation that \r\nsurvived the first genocide of the twentieth century, \r\nArmenia unequivocally welcomes the clear position \r\nadopted by the States Members of the United Nations \r\nthat precludes any possibility of immunity or pardon \r\nfor perpetrators of crimes against humanity.\r\nIn May 2013, Armenia assumed the chairmanship \r\nof the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, \r\na regional organization that is a key partner of the \r\nUnited Nations in our shared global quest to advance \r\nthe principles of fundamental freedoms, the defence \r\nand promotion of human rights and the continuous \r\nefforts for peace and security.\r\nCooperation between the two organizations is also \r\nwell established in the fight against racism, xenophobia, \r\nhate speech and intolerance. Those issues are also \r\namong the priorities established during Armenia’s \r\nchairmanship, elaborated in response to the challenges \r\nthat Member States of both the United Nations and the \r\nCouncil of Europe are facing today.\r\nArmenia is committed to strengthening the \r\ninstitutional capacities of the United Nations. In that \r\nregard, we support the United Nations reform process \r\nand are ready to contribute to it. We believe that the \r\nreforms provide an opportunity to enhance the role of \r\nthe Organization in addressing the crucial issues facing \r\nthe world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ahmed Teguedi, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCooperation of Mauritania.\r\nMr. Teguedi (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nI am particularly pleased to present our warmest \r\n22/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\npersonnel in our country, in addition to the creation \r\nof four medical schools to train nurses and senior \r\ntechnicians.\r\nHealth, which goes in line with education, is a major \r\nchallenge for developing countries and the African \r\ncontinent in particular. Given that, our Government \r\nhas allocated an important percentage of its budget for \r\nthat vital sector and has created national programmes \r\nto fight against such deadly diseases as AIDS, malaria \r\nand tuberculosis. In that connection, we have created \r\nfour new fully equipped hospitals in various parts of \r\nthe country, in addition to 70 primary-care clinics. \r\nWe must also note the construction of a specialized \r\noncology hospital, which is considered to be among the \r\nmost sophisticated in the region. The health-care sector \r\nalso works closely with United Nations specialized \r\nagencies in organizing ongoing vaccination campaigns \r\nfor children under 5 years of age. \r\nAs with most developing countries, our country \r\ndepends on imports of basic goods from the global \r\nmarket, which weighs heavily on our balance sheets, \r\nespecially since the prices of such products are subject \r\nto f luctuations in the world market. Aware of that, our \r\nGovernment has pursued an economic and financial \r\npolicy that would alleviate the effects generated from \r\noutside. Our agricultural sector has therefore been \r\nable, thanks to the policy, to fulfil 60 per cent of the \r\ncountry’s rice needs and 37 per cent of its need for other \r\ngrains. Wheat crops, which were recently introduced, \r\nhave begun to produce. \r\nIn that context, a sugar-cane cultivation project was \r\nlaunched to make sugar available locally. Generally, \r\nour Government has worked tirelessly in all sectors to \r\nensure that its citizens can live in dignity. A free-trade \r\nzone has been created in Nouadhibou — the economic \r\ncapital of the country and the third-largest city in \r\npopulation — which will transform the region into an \r\nimportant economic centre benefiting the country and \r\nthe region as a whole.\r\nIn order to strengthen good governance and the \r\nfight against corruption, the Inspector General and the \r\nCourt of Auditors have been revitalized since President \r\nMohamed Ould Abdel Aziz took office. Significant \r\nfunds in some sectors have been poorly managed, \r\nbut have been reimbursed to the State. Civil servants \r\nhave been made accountable for the poor allocation of \r\ncertain resources. Agreements were reached to end the \r\nno-bid contract system. The lack of competitive bidding \r\nWe also call upon those countries to implement an \r\nappropriate policy, under the supervision of the United \r\nNations specialized agencies and in cooperation with \r\nthe international financial institutions, that will be \r\nbased primarily on the following: support for health \r\nand education systems; debt forgiveness; the transfer \r\nof the necessary technology; the improvement of \r\nNorth-South trade; the removal of customs duties on \r\nexports from the developing countries, especially the \r\nleast developed countries, to the markets of the North; \r\nthe promotion of South-South cooperation, which will \r\nprobably strengthen economic cooperation between \r\ngroup members; the establishment of new international \r\nmechanisms that will be charged with overseeing \r\nregional complementarity, strengthening South-South \r\nrelations, as underscored in the aforementioned Human \r\nDevelopment Report, which will facilitate the sharing \r\nof know-how, lessons learned and technology transfer \r\nbetween those countries.\r\nUnder the leadership of the President of the \r\nRepublic, Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, our \r\nGovernment is working to improve the standard of \r\nliving of our citizens, despite our limited resources. \r\nIn order to attain that objective, the Government \r\nhas pursued a rigorous educational policy, based on \r\ncompulsory and widespread primary education and the \r\nstrengthening of a modern secondary education with \r\nfree higher education in several different fields. Basic \r\nschooling is now available in almost all of our villages \r\nand cities. That was made possible thanks to the \r\nGovernment policy of limiting anarchic urbanization \r\nby merging numerous villages.\r\nWith regard to secondary education, all the \r\ndepartments throughout the country now have middle \r\nschools and many have high schools. That has allowed \r\nthe children of people living in remote villages to \r\ncontinue their secondary schooling. High schools \r\nreserved for the most promising students were also \r\nestablished to take advantage of their talents and steer \r\nthem towards specializations that meet the needs of the \r\nlabour market. Higher education took a large qualitative \r\nstep forward. A university campus has just been \r\ncompleted in Nouakchott. An Islamic studies university \r\nhas been opened in the interior of the country, as well as \r\nfour specialized schools of higher education, including \r\nthe School of Mines, the Polytechnic, the School of \r\nAgricultural Training and Public Works. The Faculty \r\nof Medicine has been strengthened and endowed with \r\nthe means necessary to cover the shortfall in medical \r\n13-48809 23/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nthat the States of the Sahel cannot tackle the scourge \r\non their own. \r\nBased on its sense of duty, the Islamic Republic \r\nof Mauritania, which has stood by Mali since the \r\nbeginning of the crisis, quickly opened its borders \r\nto our Malian brothers and sisters who were seeking \r\nrefuge in our territory. We have provided and continue \r\nto provide shelter for those individuals. Our capital, \r\nNouakchott, over many months hosted a series of \r\nnegotiations between the Malian provisional authorities \r\nand the Azawad groups, which led to the signing of the \r\nOugadougou accords, thus facilitating the preparations \r\nfor the presidential elections. We take this opportunity \r\nto express our sincere congratulations to the people of \r\nthe sister nation of Mali and the hope that the changes \r\nwill lead to a new era of well-being, security and \r\nprogress.\r\nOur country strongly condemns the horrific \r\nterrorist attack on the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, which \r\ncost the lives of dozens of individuals.\r\nFor more than two years, certain countries of the \r\nArab region have experienced instability owing to the \r\nso-called Arab Spring. Our country, respectful of the \r\nprinciple of non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other States, expresses its full solidarity with the \r\npeoples of those countries. \r\nWith deep concern and worry, we are following the \r\nmost recent developments in the Syrian Arab Republic. \r\nWe invite all stakeholders to refrain from violence \r\nand any escalation of violence and, instead, to follow \r\nthe logic of dialogue, aimed at finding a peaceful \r\nsolution so as to spare the brotherly Syrian people from \r\nsuffering and tragedy. At the same time, with respect \r\nto the preservation, territorial integrity and sovereignty \r\nof the Syrian territory, it is our hope that the mission \r\nof Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, Joint Special Representative \r\nof the United Nations and the League of Arab States \r\non the Syrian crisis, will achieve success. It is our firm \r\nhope that a swift solution can be found that will bring \r\nan end to the bloodshed, destruction of infrastructure \r\nand economic devastation in sisterly Syria.\r\nWe hope that the people of Egypt, Yemen, Libya and \r\nTunisia can quickly conclude their transition periods \r\nand build democratic institutions that will guarantee \r\nthe rights and dignity of their citizens in an atmosphere \r\nof well-being and prosperity.\r\nOur country pays close attention to the situation \r\nin Western Sahara. We reaffirm our support for the \r\nhas undermined equity among the various economic \r\ndrivers of national and international markets.\r\nTransparency now prevails in the recruitment \r\nof civil servants — thanks to competitive \r\nexaminations — fostering equality among men and \r\nwomen and providing hope to young people. Merit-\r\nbased candidate selection is now possible, leading to an \r\nend to nepotism and favouritism.\r\nThe Government’s austerity policy, including its \r\nreduced administrative budget and increased investment \r\nbudget, has contributed to the self-financing of the \r\nmajority of the country’s development projects. The \r\npolicy has also led to reduced unemployment, which \r\nnow hovers around 10 per cent. The policies have also \r\ncontributed to an increased growth rate, which should \r\nattain, according to current forecasts, more than 6 per \r\ncent by the end of the year. We have also been preparing \r\nfor municipal and legislative elections slated for the \r\nend of the year. That will strengthen good governance \r\nand allow our citizens to participate in the process of \r\ndefining the country’s future, and setting political and \r\neconomic priorities for our country.\r\nOur foreign policy is solidly based on a concern \r\nfor strengthening good-neighbourly relations and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States. \r\nWe will work with our Maghreb region — Arab and \r\nAfrican — with a sense of duty towards international \r\nrelations and issues so as to disseminate a culture of \r\npeace, encourage dialogue and the resort to wisdom, \r\nand facilitate the role of diplomacy as a means of \r\nresolving conflicts and avoiding or ending war.\r\nPresident Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, who has not \r\nwavered in exerting his utmost efforts, as the Head of \r\nthe African Union Peace and Security Council, to find \r\nsolutions to certain conflicts in the African continent, \r\nincluding in Côte d’Ivoire, Libya and Mali. He has \r\nplayed a very important role, through his presence at \r\nsubregional and international summits, focusing on \r\npeace and security around the world. \r\nFor a number of years, the African Sahel region has \r\nbeen subjected to all types of cross-border organized \r\ncrime, including drug trafficking, arms trafficking, \r\nillegal immigration and kidnapping. We reiterate our \r\ncall to the international community to support the \r\nStates of the region in tackling those dangers, which \r\nhave recently threatened the very existence of a States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. That clearly shows \r\n24/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nenjoy justice and equality — the very lofty principles \r\nfor which our Organization was created. These are the \r\nonly guarantees of our success.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister \r\nfor Education and Minister for Cultural Affairs of the \r\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): At the outset, let me \r\nconvey the sincere condolences of the people and the \r\nGovernment of Liechtenstein to all those affected by \r\nthe abhorrent terrorist attack in Kenya. Our thoughts \r\nare with the victims and their families.\r\nFor the second year in a row, the Assembly is \r\nmeeting under the shadow of the crisis in Syria. It is the \r\nchallenge of our time. No other situation in the recent \r\npast has so dramatically tested the United Nations \r\nability to respond. And none has so starkly illustrated \r\nthe limitations and the weaknesses of our multilateral \r\nsystem. Thousands of people have been killed in a \r\nbrutal war, many of them women and children, and \r\nmany of them victims of war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity. Regional stability has been eroded. Millions \r\nof people are depending on humanitarian assistance, \r\nwhich is often impossible to deliver. Humanitarian \r\naccess to those most in need, including the sick and \r\nthe wounded, is being systematically denied owing \r\nto cynical political calculations. The humanitarian \r\nagencies have become a pawn in that perverted game.\r\nSadly, it took a particularly outrageous act to \r\ngenerate action in the Security Council: the use of \r\nchemical weapons, with hundreds of victims, including \r\ncountless children. We are encouraged to see that the \r\nCouncil has decided to ensure the destruction of all \r\nchemical weapons in Syria. That should also provide \r\nnew momentum to ensure that all remaining States join \r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. Indeed, it should \r\nbe a step towards the elimination of all weapons of \r\nmass destruction worldwide.\r\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria has marked a \r\nwatershed in the conflict. Nevertheless, that issue must \r\nnot divert our attention away from the core problem: \r\nthe fighting in Syria continues unabated, with blatant \r\ndisregard for the civilian population and international \r\nhumanitarian law. Weapons and ammunition cross the \r\nborders more easily than humanitarian assistance.\r\nThe recent breakthrough on the issue of chemical \r\nweapons shows that political progress is possible. \r\nendeavours of the Secretary-General and his personal \r\nenvoy in their search for a definitive, lasting, fair and \r\ncomprehensive solution that is acceptable to both parties. \r\nSuch a solution would bolster peace and security in the \r\nregion and facilitate the building of a prosperous Arab \r\nMaghreb that is in step with the legitimate aspirations \r\nof its people.\r\nThe Arab-Israeli conflict is considered a source of \r\nhostility and a threat to peace and security in a vital \r\nand critical region of the world. It remains so in spite \r\nof the legal framework and general conditions for the \r\nsettlement of that dispute that have been established \r\nover the years by a series of Security Council and \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions. Those foundations were \r\nrecently further backed by the Arab Peace Initiative \r\nbased on the land-for-peace principle. In spite of all of \r\nthat, the conflict continues, as it has done for too long.\r\nWe welcome resolution 67/19, of 29 November \r\n2012, whereby the General Assembly granted Palestine \r\nthe status of non-Member observer State in the United \r\nNations. We hope that that resolution will mark the \r\nbeginning of a new era that will see justice done for the \r\nPalestinian people and their rights restored through the \r\nestablishment of their independent and sovereign Sate \r\nalong the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. That would put an end to the suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people, which dates back to the inception of \r\nour Organization.\r\nBased on the need to ensure justice, credibility and \r\nequity in the relations between the two parties to that \r\nconflict, and out of respect for the relevant resolutions \r\nand decisions under international law, the international \r\ncommunity should live up to its historic responsibilities \r\nwith regard to Palestine. We reiterate our condemnation \r\nof the ongoing blockade against the Gaza Strip, and \r\nwe condemn the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli \r\nwar machine against Palestinian civilians and the \r\ndestruction of their facilities. We welcome efforts, \r\nmost recently by the United States Administration, \r\nseeking the resumption of negotiations between the two \r\nparties. We hope that those efforts will contribute to the \r\nrealization of the Palestinian people’s simplest right: \r\nthe establishment of their independent State.\r\nThe commitments made by the international \r\ncommunity through the United Nations will go \r\nunrealized if the people of the world are unable to fulfil \r\ntheir potential for development, especially in developing \r\ncountries, to live lives of dignity and freedom, and to \r\n13-48809 25/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\npositions. It is therefore implementing its mandate and \r\nnot politicizing the work it does.\r\nRecent events in Syria have reminded us of the \r\nimportance of the amendments to the Rome Statute \r\nadopted in Kampala in 2010. We added provisions \r\nthat criminalize the use of poisonous and other gases, \r\nwhether they are used in international or in internal \r\narmed conflict. It is troubling that those provisions \r\nhave become relevant so quickly. But the biggest steps \r\nforward are amendments to crimes of aggression. They \r\ncomplement the prohibition of the illegal use of force \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nmost serious forms of the illegal use of force by one \r\nState against another will become a punishable offence \r\nbefore the ICC. The Court will thereby help enforce \r\nthe core principle of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. With ratifications by Andorra, Cyprus, Slovenia \r\nand Uruguay earlier this week, we have come a \r\nsignificant step closer to our common goal, namely, \r\nthe activation of the Court’s policy over crimes of \r\naggression in 2017. Liechtenstein was the first country \r\nto ratify the amendments, and we will continue to assist \r\nin the ratification process.\r\nLiechtenstein firmly believes in the responsibility \r\nto protect populations from crimes of atrocity. Clearly, \r\nwe have much work left to do in order to put that \r\nnorm into practice. Our inability to respond to the \r\ncrisis in Syria demonstrates a crucial weakness in the \r\nsystem: the use of the veto, or its threat, in a manner \r\nincompatible with the purposes of the United Nations. \r\nThat can make the Security Council irrelevant when it \r\nis most urgently needed. During this general debate, \r\nthe President of France suggested a common code of \r\nconduct for Permanent Members of the Security Council \r\n(see A/68/PV.5). We strongly agree with that proposal. \r\nAll five permanent members should be able to give the \r\nworld one public commitment, that is, that they will \r\nnot use their veto to block action aimed at ending or \r\npreventing crimes of atrocity. That would be crucial to \r\nenhancing the Council’s effectiveness and credibility. \r\nUnfortunately, we have not yet reached the point where \r\nwe are able to bring the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil in line with the geopolitical realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. But the Council is also struggling \r\nto adjust its working methods to new challenges in order \r\nto better include the perspective of non-members in its \r\ndecisions, which is a crucial ingredient for effective \r\nleadership. We will therefore continue our efforts to \r\nHopefully, that will create the momentum for the \r\nCouncil to finally live up to its responsibility: to end \r\nthe supply of weapons, pressure the parties to the \r\nconflict to accept a ceasefire, work towards a political \r\nsolution and prepare the ground for accountability for \r\npast crimes. There may be different views on who used \r\nchemical weapons in Syria, but everyone agrees that \r\nthat use constitutes a crime against humanity and a war \r\ncrime that must not go unpunished. It must therefore be \r\nput before a court of law, together with the countless \r\nother crimes committed, for an independent and \r\nimpartial investigation.\r\nSyria is our biggest collective failure with regard \r\nto accountability in recent history. The International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) has been operational for more \r\nthan a decade now. During that time, we have not \r\nwitnessed any other situation in which crimes have \r\nbeen committed so systematically, on such a scale and \r\nfor such a long time without any adequate response \r\nfrom the international community.\r\nIt is well documented that crimes have been and \r\ncontinue to be committed by all sides. That is precisely \r\nthe type of crisis for which we established the ICC, and \r\nit is precisely the type of situation that led us to give \r\nthe Security Council the competence to refer situations \r\nto the Court. In its recent resolution 2118 (2013), the \r\nCouncil made a limited statement on accountability. \r\nMore determined and more concrete action must follow. \r\nA referral to the ICC will ultimately also contribute \r\nto a viable political future for the country, create \r\naccountability for those crimes, provide redress for the \r\nvictims and establish the truth.\r\nThe establishment of the International Criminal \r\nCourt has been the most significant development \r\nin international law for decades. Only the adoption \r\nof the Arms Trade Treaty earlier this year has come \r\neven close in terms of significance. With 122 States \r\nparties, the Court has attracted a strong following. But \r\nthe emergence of an effective international judicial \r\nmechanism also poses challenges. We have mandated \r\nthe Court to investigate and prosecute the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law. And we have asked it \r\nto focus on those perpetrators who bear the greatest \r\nresponsibility. Therefore, it cannot be surprising to \r\nanyone that the Court is dealing with individuals in \r\nleadership positions. We are satisfied that the Court \r\nfollows the evidence, and that it does not shy away \r\nfrom investigating and prosecuting those in powerful \r\n26/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nof global impact and for setting standards that apply to \r\nall. This is our General Assembly. Let us use it.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Abubaker Al-Qirbi, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Government of National Reconciliation of the \r\nRepublic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Al-Qirbi (Yemen) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme, at the outset to extend sincere my congratulations \r\nto Ambassador John Ashe, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are confident \r\nthat he will ably guide the work of the Assembly during \r\nthis session. I also extend my thanks and gratitude \r\nto Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the Assembly at \r\nthe previous session, for his efforts. We wish to \r\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his wise \r\nleadership of the Organization and for his interest in \r\nthe developments taking place in the world and in my \r\ncountry. \r\nIt is a felicitous coincidence that the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly coincides with the \r\ncelebrations in my country in honour of the September \r\nand October revolutions. Allow me, from this important \r\ninternational rostrum, to congratulate the great and \r\nvaliant people of Yemen on this important occasion \r\nand to commend the country and people of Yemen for \r\ntheir resilience and their sacrifices in emancipating \r\nthemselves from the yoke of colonization, injustice, \r\noppression and despotism. \r\nI also wish to congratulate the people of Yemen for \r\nwisely and patiently forging ahead on the path of change \r\nand modernization for more than 50 years and for their \r\ndetermination to rid themselves of all the remnants \r\nof the past. I commend them on their stewardship of \r\nthe historic political change, chief among them the \r\nimplementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) \r\ninitiative, with the support of international and regional \r\ncommunities. From this rostrum, I wish to commend \r\nmy country’s youth for its leadership throughout the \r\ntransition process in building institutions, enhancing \r\nand promoting freedom and democracy, and building a \r\nnew Yemen where justice, liberty and good governance \r\nprevail. \r\nThe values of justice, freedom and equality, respect \r\nfor human rights and the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security are the main pillars and principles \r\non which the United Nations was established. Because \r\nof our firm belief in those values and principles, we \r\nhave always sought to implement and promote United \r\npromote accountability and transparency in the work \r\nof the Council.\r\nThe rule of law and accountability have made \r\nsteady progress in the work of the United Nations. \r\nNevertheless, that progress remains abstract for \r\ncountless individuals who are vulnerable to atrocities. \r\nSexual violence in conflict has become a rampant \r\nphenomenon, with women and girls at particular risk of \r\nbecoming victims. The ICC has made the fight against \r\nthat scourge a priority. Most important, though, we \r\nmust do our part as States. Liechtenstein fully supports \r\nthe United Kingdom’s initiative to take greater action \r\nto end sexual violence during conflict. The fight \r\nagainst sexual violence must also play a central role \r\nin the larger context of the women, peace and security \r\nagenda. All of that requires stronger emphasis on the \r\nneed to empower women. Many of our stated goals, \r\nfrom sustainable development to lasting peace, require \r\nthe full participation of women. Otherwise, they are \r\nsimply not attainable. In that regard, I am grateful for \r\nthe leadership of the Secretary-General. We should all \r\nrally behind his call to make the twenty-first century \r\nthe century for women.\r\nThe upcoming negotiations on the post-2015 agenda \r\nwill be a crucial test of our ability to tackle challenges \r\nthat will define the lives of future generations. We look \r\nforward to the leadership of the President of the General \r\nAssembly in that process. It is of course too early to \r\noffer a final assessment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. But we know that important unfinished business \r\nwill be carried over into the sustainable development \r\ngoals. Those new goals must be much more than just an \r\nextension of past efforts. They must aim at eradicating \r\npoverty and hunger once and for all, and finally ensure \r\nfull equality between men and women. They must \r\ntherefore be firmly rooted in human rights, respect for \r\nthe rule of law and principles of good governance. The \r\nsustainable development goals will ensure sustainability \r\nonly if they approach development in a holistic way. \r\nMost important, once we have agreed on our new goals, \r\nwe need to become more serious in our commitment to \r\nachieving them. Let us therefore develop and apply an \r\neffective monitoring mechanism to show the world that \r\nwe are indeed serious.\r\nThe post-2015 process will also be decisive in \r\nmoving the General Assembly back to the centre of \r\nmultilateral policy-making. Only the “G-193” provides \r\nthe legitimacy and universality required for decisions \r\n13-48809 27/28\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.19\r\nYemen where democracy, the peaceful transfer of \r\npower, the promotion of freedom, justice, partnership, \r\nequality and equal opportunities for all citizens prevail. \r\nThose foundations will enhance the authority of the \r\nState, the rule of law, security, stability and the unity \r\nof Yemen. \r\nWe are also forging ahead with strengthening \r\nsecurity and stability in our country and restructuring \r\nthe military and security institutions, so as to bolster \r\ntheir main national task — to be loyal to the State \r\nrather than to parties or individuals. We are certain that \r\nour brethren and our friends will assist us in our new \r\nendeavour, namely, the drafting of the new constitution \r\nand the holding of a referendum on it, as well as in our \r\npreparations for the next presidential and parliamentary \r\nelections. \r\nThe achievements being made and that will be \r\nmade, in the ongoing political process depend heavily \r\non the support of the international community and on \r\nenhanced partnership and cooperation between the \r\ninternational community and Yemen, especially as \r\nthere are internal and external parties that continue \r\nto attack the will of the Yemeni people. Those parties \r\nare making every effort to obstruct the achievement \r\nof political settlements and to target all the factors of \r\nstability and the foundations of development in my \r\ncountry. Such acts require the appropriate international \r\nmeasures so as to deter and punish all those who are \r\ntrying to defeat this unique model in the region. \r\nThere are a multitude of factors at play, particularly \r\nthe increasing unemployment rate, growing levels \r\nof poverty, and poor social services in general. All \r\nthose factors exacerbate instability and create a fertile \r\nenvironment for the actions of extremist groups such \r\nas Al-Qaida. However, eliminating them effectively \r\nrequires all kinds of logistical, financial and technical \r\nsupport through practical programmes and plans that \r\ndo address not only the symptoms, but also the root \r\ncauses of those phenomena. \r\nWe need the international community’s support \r\nin implementing our national counter-terrorism \r\nstrategy. That is why the fulfilment of pledges by donor \r\ncountries and the Friends of Yemen must be accelerated, \r\nparticularly since the Government of Yemen has been \r\nworking in partnership with donors to earmark and \r\nallocate all those funds to various development areas. \r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank all our \r\ndonors, especially those who have already made good \r\nNations instruments and to support peaceful coexistence \r\namong nations. Perhaps the lofty and noble purposes \r\nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and all its instruments served as inspiration in \r\nthe political settlement and the comprehensive national \r\ndialogue that we have been pursuing for more than six \r\nmonths.\r\nThose purposes and principles are also reflected in \r\ntwo aspects of the current situation. First is our desire \r\nfor coexistence and consensus, our rejection of violence \r\nand our preference for the language of dialogue and \r\nlogic and reason. The second aspect is the fact that \r\nYemen is considered a unique model that should be \r\nfollowed, given the tremendous change being witnessed \r\nin our region. The acute crisis that befell Yemen in 2011 \r\nreflected internal understanding and tolerance and a \r\ndesire for coordination with regional and international \r\npartners. \r\nIn that context, we wish to reiterate our thanks \r\nand appreciation to all those who stood by the people \r\nof Yemen and by the political settlement embodied in \r\nthe Gulf initiative, chief among them the Custodian of \r\nthe Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz \r\nAl-Saud; the leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\nand the GCC Secretary General, Mr. Abdul Latif bin \r\nRashid Al Zayani. I also extend my thanks to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and to Security Council members \r\nfor visiting Yemen on two occasions. \r\nAs my country is a unique model among the \r\ncountries in which the Arab Spring is unfolding, those \r\nvisits have enhanced the new approach, which is based \r\non the GCC initiative and Security Council resolutions \r\non Yemen. We thank the five permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council for their unified vision with regard to \r\nYemen, which made it possible for us to forge ahead \r\nwith the political process and crown it with success. \r\nWe also extend our appreciation to the League of \r\nArab States, the European Union, Germany and all the \r\nrelevant international organizations and institutions, as \r\nwell as to the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General \r\non Yemen, Mr. Jamal Benomar, for his efforts to achieve \r\nreconciliation between the parties in Yemen. \r\nAs the Assembly is aware, my country has made \r\ngreat strides in the implementation of the GCC initiative \r\nand its mechanisms. We are now turning to the second \r\nphase, that of concluding the work of the comprehensive \r\nNational Dialogue and forging ahead with our plan to \r\nshape our future. The results of this endeavour will lay \r\nthe foundations for the establishment of a new, modern \r\n28/28 13-48809\r\nA/68/PV.19 28/09/2013\r\nPalestinian conflict and put a stop to all the occupying \r\nPower’s oppressive measures and practices and attempts \r\nto Judaize the holy city of Jerusalem, expand settlement \r\nactivities, detain Palestinian citizens and excavate \r\nillegally around the Al-Aqsa Mosque.\r\nWe also wish to denounce the use of chemical \r\nweapons, especially in Syria, by any party. We \r\ncall on all the parties in the Syrian conflict to stop \r\nthe bloodshed, agree to a dialogue and to work \r\ntowards a political settlement and reconciliation \r\nand reconstruction. We call on the international and \r\nregional parties concerned to intensify their efforts to \r\nachieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis. A “Geneva \r\nII” conference should be convened as soon as possible \r\nin order to put an end to the violence, killings and \r\nbloodshed in Syria. Recent events have demonstrated \r\nthe challenges facing the United Nations in this area, \r\nparticularly regarding the disagreement between \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, which was \r\na pretext for certain groups to opt for unilateral action \r\noutside the international legitimacy represented by the \r\nUnited Nations. The Council needs thorough reform for \r\nit to be able to carry out its primary task, which is the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nthe peaceful settlement of conflicts.\r\nConcerning the brotherly country of Somalia \r\nand our support for it, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to continue to stand by it in order to enable \r\nit to overcome its long legacy of conflict and suffering.\r\nFinally, I would like to thank the President and the \r\nSecretary-General once again.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\non their pledges and financial commitments to Yemen. \r\nThat is particularly important in view of the fact \r\nthat Yemen, owing to its geographic location, social \r\ncomposition and economic status, has been plagued \r\nby various problems and challenges. They include the \r\nactivities of Al-Qaida and of cross-border organized \r\ncrime and national and international criminal groups \r\ntrafficking in drugs, weapons and people, as well as \r\nthe piracy off Yemen’s coasts. Addressing all those \r\nproblems requires international cooperation for the \r\nsecurity of the country and the region as a whole.\r\nWe would also like to bring up the issue of refugees \r\nin Yemen, especially from the Horn of Africa. We \r\nhave been hosting more one million of them, with \r\nall the economic, social and security difficulties that \r\nsuch a situation entails. We are therefore calling on the \r\ninternational community and relevant organizations to \r\nhelp us to deal with the issue and mitigate its negative \r\nimpact on Yemen. We must find new ways and means \r\nto help the Government care for the refugees and help \r\nthem to return to their homes, especially since those \r\ncountries have lately seen their stability restored to \r\nsome degree.\r\nConflicts and bloody events, especially in the \r\nMiddle East, are contrary to the lofty goals of the United \r\nNations, which is why the international community \r\nmust revisit the structure and working methods of the \r\nOrganization and make the reforms necessary to enable \r\nit to effectively discharge its responsibilities for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nto revitalize its role. In that regard, we should mention \r\nthe despair and frustration of many Arab and Muslim \r\nnations over the failure to end the Israeli occupation \r\nof Palestine, arrive at a just solution to the Israeli-\r\n"
