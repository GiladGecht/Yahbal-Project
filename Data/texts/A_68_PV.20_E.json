"In the absence of the President, Mr. Beck (Solomon \r\nIslands), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Highness \r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (United \r\nArab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to join previous speakers in congratulating the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly on his election to \r\nserve at its sixty-eighth session. I am confident that \r\nhis experience in international affairs will contribute \r\nto the success of this session. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to commend his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić, for his wise leadership during the last session, \r\nand to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his \r\nstaff for their tireless efforts to promote global peace, \r\nsecurity and development.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates continues to firmly \r\nbelieve in the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations, as enshrined in its Charter, calling for the \r\nprotection of international peace and security, the \r\npromotion of peaceful coexistence among nations and \r\npeoples through the peaceful resolution of international \r\ndisputes, respect for the provisions of international \r\nlaw, and non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nStates. Those goals also call for us to foster a climate \r\nfavourable to international relations based on tolerance, \r\nnon-violence and recognition of others. My country \r\nhas followed such an approach in its regional and \r\ninternational relations.\r\nHowever, we cannot conceal our deep concern at \r\nthe recent events in the Arab region associated with \r\nsectarian strife, an escalation in terrorist attacks \r\nand growing incitement to violence, which, in turn, \r\nhave given rise to extreme polarization in the region \r\nand among its peoples, severely impacting stability \r\nand development. In the Arab Gulf, we see how \r\nextremism and terrorism in the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nare threatening to undermine security and stability and \r\ndestroy a history of tolerance in which sectarianism has \r\nnever played any role. The situation has been further \r\naggravated by the politicization and exploitation of \r\nthe religion of Islam by those seeking to use it as a \r\ntool to exclude and marginalize other segments of \r\nsociety, which, until now, had all lived in constructive, \r\nharmonious and peaceful coexistence.\r\nAll of this has led to widespread fears about the \r\nfate of the national State and what that implies in \r\nterms of the undermining of the pillars of the State, \r\nthe wasting of its resources and the weakening of its \r\neconomy. As members may be aware, such difficult \r\nconditions have put the young people of the region in \r\njeopardy of falling into the clutches of extremism and \r\nviolence, especially in a climate of growing despair and \r\nlack of opportunities.\r\nThat is why the United Arab Emirates gives \r\nparamount importance to its efforts aimed at promoting \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.20\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n20th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 28 September 2013, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That the issues and events that take place \r\nin Egypt are very important and cannot be overlooked \r\nis beyond question. Egypt is a pivotal State whose \r\nstability and civil peace signify that the region is \r\nbeginning to recover. Accordingly, the United Arab \r\nEmirates is following with great interest the positive \r\ndevelopments that are occurring in Egypt, as we firmly \r\nbelieve that Egypt plays a key role in ensuring stability, \r\ndevelopment and prosperity. There is no doubt that a \r\nstable and calm Egypt is vital to security and peace, \r\nnot only in the Arab region, but in the world as a whole.\r\nOn 30 June, Egypt experienced a second wave of \r\nrevolution, when tens of millions of Egyptians expressed \r\ntheir resolute will to draw up a road map for a better \r\nfuture for their country. In it the ground is laid for an \r\ninclusive democratic path based on the participation of \r\nall segments of society without any exceptions, within \r\nthe framework of a policy characterized by moderation, \r\ncentrism, non-violence and the non-use of religion as a \r\nmeans to exclude or classify or to foment sectarianism or \r\nhatred. The United Arab Emirates therefore believes that \r\nthe sovereign measures implemented by the Egyptian \r\nGovernment to protect national security and the steps \r\nit has taken to implement the road map supported by \r\nthe people give grounds for optimism and enhance the \r\nEgyptian Government’s credibility. I would also take \r\nthis opportunity to urge the international community to \r\nstand behind Egypt at this critical juncture and support \r\nthe sincere efforts of its interim Government to lay \r\nthe foundations of stability, development and civilian \r\nconstitutional rule.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates recognizes the suffering \r\nof the Arab region caused by the interference of others \r\nin its internal affairs and the ensuing threats to national \r\nstatehood generally. We therefore wish to warn of the \r\ndanger of interfering in the domestic affairs of Egypt \r\nand call on everyone to refrain from disrupting the \r\ncountry’s march towards stability and democracy.\r\nThe issues that the Arab region faces are all \r\ninterconnected. Everyone in this Hall realizes that \r\npeace emerges as a central and relevant issue to all \r\nthat is occurring there. Although many decades have \r\npassed, the Palestinian people continue to look forward \r\na culture of moderation and non-violence and fighting \r\nextremism in all its forms. In that regard, I refer in \r\nparticular to my country’s initiative to fight extremism \r\nthrough the Hedayah International Centre of Excellence \r\nfor Countering Violent Extremism. The United Arab \r\nEmirates actually proposed the Centre’s establishment \r\nat a meeting held here at the United Nations, and today \r\nthe Centre is seeing the light.\r\nIn that context, I can only condemn in the strongest \r\npossible terms all cowardly attacks, but particularly \r\nthe terrorist attack committed at the shopping centre \r\nin Nairobi, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of \r\ninnocent victims.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is deeply disappointed \r\nat the international community’s inability to put an \r\nimmediate end to the worsening tragedy of the brotherly \r\nSyrian people caused by continual military actions and \r\nindiscriminate and systematic bombings by Syrian \r\nforces in Damascus. So far, more than 100,000 people \r\nhave been killed and millions of people have been \r\ninjured or displaced. This is an extremely dangerous \r\nviolation of international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nWe are deeply concerned at the increasingly serious \r\nimplications of the conflict in Syria and the entire region. \r\nWe strongly condemn and reject all crimes against \r\nhumanity committed by the Syrian regime, especially \r\nthe chemical attack against Ghouta, Damascus, which \r\nkilled thousands of civilians, including children. \r\nWe therefore call upon the international community \r\nto take all measures necessary to punish the Syrian \r\nregime for its massacring of civilians. The Assembly \r\nshould be aware of the frustration that we and the \r\nmajority of countries in the region feel with respect \r\nto the dysfunction of United Nations mechanisms that \r\ncould have prevented the Syrian regime’s aggressive \r\nacts against its own people. The Organization’s failure \r\nto act is directly responsible for exacerbating the \r\nhumanitarian tragedy that we are witnessing in Syria \r\ntoday. It is also responsible for the threat to the Syrian \r\nState, Syrian society and the Syrian people.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has fulfilled its \r\nresponsibilities with respect to ongoing relief operations \r\nfor the Syrian people and continues to provide all kinds \r\nof aid — building hospitals, providing medical supplies \r\nand staffing medical teams. It calls for concerted \r\ninternational and regional efforts, directly or through \r\ninternational organizations, to meet the humanitarian \r\n13-48911 3/7\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.20\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran. We affirm that our country \r\nwill sincerely cooperate with him in the interest of \r\npromoting security, stability and prosperity in the \r\nregion.\r\nThere has been considerable debate about Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme. Many suspicions revolve around \r\nit. Therefore, we urge Iran to constructively cooperate \r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency, defuse \r\nall scepticism about the peaceful nature of its nuclear \r\nactivities, and act with full transparency and clarity \r\nto avoid any negative consequences that could arise \r\nfrom the absence of such cooperation. The United Arab \r\nEmirates does, however, believe that the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy has become an urgent requirement to \r\nmeet today’s growing demand for energy.\r\nWe are proud that we are a nation that has pioneered \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy, which are surrounded \r\nby all possible security and safety guarantees. The \r\nUnited Arab Emirates has opened the way for the \r\nintroduction of renewable energy and the development \r\nof clean-energy technologies as its contribution to \r\nhumankind in protecting the planet from the negative \r\neffects of climate change.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates firmly believes in \r\nthe necessity of achieving human development at the \r\nnational and international levels. That goal can be \r\nachieved only when a number of conditions are met, \r\nincluding respect for human rights and for the equality \r\nof all without discrimination on the basis of gender, \r\nethnicity, religion, language or any other ground. That \r\nrequires due regard for human dignity, the renunciation \r\nof violence and the prohibition of torture and abuse. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates has been encouraged by the \r\npositive response to its periodic report by the members \r\nof the Human Rights Council, who commended the \r\ncountry’s achievements and progress.\r\nAchieving overall human development requires the \r\ncreation of an environment conducive to tolerance and \r\nmoderation, free of any incitement to hatred. In that \r\ncontext, it is necessary to support and promote dialogue \r\namong different countries and religions, without \r\narrogance or superiority on the part of any culture over \r\nanother, because each culture has something to give \r\nand something to gain with respect to another’s culture.\r\nThe empowerment of women, the recognition \r\nof their vital role in communities and the protection \r\nof women against discrimination in various fields \r\nare imperatives for the international community. \r\nto realizing their right to self-determination and the \r\nestablishment of an independent State, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, based on international legal \r\ninstruments that recognize their right to establish a \r\nState, in line with the 4 June 1967 borders, as confirmed \r\nby United Nations resolutions and in accordance with \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto welcome the relaunching of peace talks under the \r\nauspices of the United States. We hope that those \r\ntalks will lead to positive results in the form of the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State. We also welcome \r\nthe European Union’s constructive position consisting \r\nof non-recognition of the legitimacy of the Israeli \r\nsettlements and the decision to cease its dealings with \r\nthem. The United Arab Emirates is ready to contribute \r\nto a successful outcome of the new initiative in order \r\nto achieve security, peace and economic growth in that \r\nimportant part of the world.\r\nSecurity and stability in the Gulf region represent \r\na high priority in the balanced policy that we have \r\nderived from principles found in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the provisions of international law, \r\nespecially those that call for peaceful coexistence, \r\nconfidence-building, good neighbourliness, mutual \r\nrespect, non-interference in the internal affairs of States, \r\nand the pursuit of peaceful means in the resolution of \r\nconflicts and disputes. Based on those principles, my \r\nGovernment expresses, once again, its regret at the \r\ncontinued Iranian occupation of our three islands — Abu \r\nMusa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb — and demands \r\nthat the  undiminished sovereignty of the United Arab \r\nEmirates over those islands be fully restored.\r\nWe emphasize that all actions and measures taken \r\nby the Iranian occupation authorities are considered \r\nnull and void and are contrary to international law \r\nand all norms of common human values. Therefore, \r\nwe call upon the international community to urge Iran \r\nto respond to my country’s repeated peaceful, sincere \r\nrequest for a just settlement of the dispute, either \r\nthrough direct, serious negotiations between our two \r\nnations or by referring the case to the International \r\nCourt of Justice, in accordance with the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of \r\ninternational law.\r\nActing from our firm principles in regional and \r\ninternational relations, we welcome the declared \r\napproach of Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\n4/7 13-48911\r\nA/68/PV.20 28/09/2013\r\norder to create an environment in which sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be pursued.\r\nThe global ecosystem is under stress from \r\nthe transnational effects of human development \r\nactivities. Human progress has come at the expense \r\nof the environment and the climate. Deforestation, \r\ndesertification of land and the transboundary pollution \r\nof the sea, land and air degrade our quality of life and \r\nthreaten human civilization.\r\nWe cannot go on with business as usual. We need \r\nto rethink and retool our economies and societies and \r\nto place poverty eradication and sustainability at the \r\ncentre of our development agenda. The President’s \r\nchoice of “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage” as the theme for the sixty-eighth session of \r\nthe General Assembly is therefore particularly timely. \r\nThe 1987 Brundtland report of the World Commission \r\non Environment and Development defined sustainable \r\ndevelopment as development that meets the needs of \r\nthe present without compromising the ability of future \r\ngenerations to meet their own needs. That should \r\nremain our guiding principle as we negotiate the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nThe United Nations has a critical role to play in the \r\nevolution of the post-2015 development agenda. Only \r\nthe United Nations, with its universal membership and \r\naccess to global data, has the standing to establish a \r\nnew global development agenda that is inclusive, \r\neffective and adaptable. The United Nations has \r\nadopted an inclusive multi-stakeholder approach to \r\ngather the views of Member States and harness the \r\nenergy of civil society. Several mechanisms have been \r\nset up, including the High-level Political Forum, the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, in which Singapore is participating actively, \r\nand the Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing. We strongly encourage the United Nations \r\nto demonstrate leadership and weave those strands of \r\ndiscussion into a single, clear framework. That would \r\nallow Member States to focus their attention and \r\nprioritize their resources to meet critical challenges.\r\nSingapore understands very well the importance \r\nof poverty eradication and sustainable development \r\nin securing a country’s future. When we became \r\nindependent, in 1965, we faced several challenges. To \r\nuplift our population, which had only a small number \r\nof skilled workers and graduates, the Government \r\nfocused on education and skills development. To create \r\nThe United Arab Emirates is proud of the significant \r\nmeasures it has taken in that respect, which have won \r\nthe United Arab Emirates a high ranking among the \r\ncountries in the region. Our country has also made \r\nsignificant strides in combating human trafficking, \r\nand it has developed national legislation to stand firm \r\nagainst that inhumane crime.\r\nAchieving sustainable development for all people \r\nis a major priority for the United Nations and its \r\nMember States and one which will require scientific \r\nand technical cooperation, as well as the transfer \r\nof technology between developed and developing \r\ncountries, to further the common good of all peoples \r\nand countries of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. K. Shanmugam, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nMinister for Law of the Republic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Shanmugam (Singapore): I warmly \r\ncongratulate Mr. John Ashe on his election as President \r\nat the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly and \r\nwish him success during his term.\r\nOver the past decade, the world has experienced a \r\nstring of crises. Development has slowed. Confidence \r\nin the global economic system has been shaken. There \r\nare signs of recovery, but growth remains anaemic and \r\nuneven. Unemployment is high in many countries, \r\nparticularly among the young. That has exacerbated \r\nproblems by increasing poverty levels, widening \r\nincome gaps, adding to social instability and causing \r\npublic trust in Governments and institutions to decline. \r\nExtreme poverty remains a major concern in many \r\nparts of the world.\r\nViolence and conflict are as great a threat to global \r\nstability as poverty, and the international community \r\nmust respond firmly to them. In that regard, Singapore \r\nwelcomes the unanimous adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2118 (2013) on the destruction of chemical \r\nweapons in Syria.  We strongly condemn the use of \r\nchemical weapons under any circumstances, as it \r\nconstitutes a violation of international law.  We remain \r\ndeeply concerned about the humanitarian situation in \r\nSyria, and we hope that the “Geneva II” conference \r\nwill be convened promptly and will find a political \r\nsolution to end the conflict and violence. We also offer \r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of Kenya \r\nover the brutal attacks in Westgate Mall, a painful \r\nreminder of the need to remain vigilant against terror. \r\nAll countries must unite against violence and terror in \r\n13-48911 5/7\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.20\r\ncore purpose of the post-2015 development agenda is to \r\nimprove the lives of people. Today, 1.2 billion people \r\nstill live in extreme poverty. That is a staggering figure.\r\nSecondly, we should emphasize urban management \r\nand the intertwined issues of water and sanitation. \r\nAccording to the United Nations Human Settlements \r\nProgramme, more than half of the world’s population \r\nlives in urban areas. By 2050, 7 out of 10 people will \r\nlive in urban areas. Many cities are already under \r\nstrain. More than 2.5 billion people lack access to basic \r\nsanitation, and another 800 million do not have safe \r\ndrinking water. Some 2,000 children die every day \r\nfrom diarrhoea. The crisis will be exacerbated as more \r\npeople move to crowded cities, where the infrastructure \r\ncannot grow fast enough to support them. Singapore \r\nintroduced a draft resolution in July, which was \r\nadopted by the General Assembly (resolution 67/291), \r\nto designate 19 November as World Toilet Day. We \r\nhope that will encourage countries to take a close look \r\nat how the nexus of urbanization, water and sanitation \r\ncan be better managed.\r\nThirdly, it is important for the views and concerns \r\nof small States to be incorporated into the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Small States make up more \r\nthan half of the United Nations membership; many, \r\nespecially small island developing States (SIDS), are \r\namong the more vulnerable Members of the United \r\nNations family. Singapore identifies closely with  the \r\nurgent concerns of our fellow SIDS. The third SIDS \r\nConference, to be held in 2014, will be an important \r\nmilestone, and Singapore has participated actively \r\nin all the preparatory meetings to date. At last year’s \r\ninaugural Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, which was organized by the Forum of Small \r\nStates (FOSS), Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon agreed \r\nthat small and vulnerable States deserved special \r\nattention. Singapore will continue to work with the \r\nmembers of FOSS to share the perspectives of small \r\nStates and ensure that our views are factored into the \r\nevolution of the new global development road map.\r\nAlthough we are a small country, we will continue \r\nto play our part in assisting other countries in poverty \r\neradication and furthering the sustainable development \r\nagenda. We established the Singapore Cooperation \r\nProgramme in 1992 to share our developmental \r\nexperience with our friends — our successes and our \r\nfailures alike. We believe that technical assistance \r\nand capacity-building are more effective in creating \r\nthe right conditions for growth. More than 80,000 \r\njobs and alleviate poverty, we also gradually moved our \r\nindustries up the value chain towards higher-skilled, \r\ninnovation-focused sectors. Given Singapore’s land \r\nand resource constraints, sustainable development was \r\na necessity, not just a slogan. At 700 square kilometres, \r\nSingapore is slightly bigger than Manhattan but smaller \r\nthan the five boroughs of New York. To ensure that our \r\ncity-State remained liveable, we had to ensure that our \r\npolicies on housing, infrastructure, transport and the \r\nenvironment were well integrated in a long-term and \r\nholistic vision.\r\nOver several decades, we have managed to pursue \r\ngrowth while preserving a good living environment. For \r\ninstance, despite the country’s being densely populated \r\nand highly urbanized, our greening efforts have resulted \r\nin more than 50 per cent of Singapore being covered by \r\nvegetation. The Singapore Botanic Gardens, founded in \r\nthe nineteenth century, is the only city botanic garden \r\nin the world to include a tract of original, primary \r\nrainforest. And despite our rapid development, we have \r\nmanaged to preserve much of our biodiversity. One of \r\nour nature reserves, Bukit Timah, contains more plant \r\nspecies than the entire North American continent.\r\nWe have also developed creative solutions to \r\novercome some of our resource constraints. Take the \r\nexample of water: Singapore now imports slightly more \r\nthan 40 per cent of our water needs. To meet our drinking \r\nand industrial needs, we use a variety of methods, \r\nincluding collecting water through reservoirs, the \r\ndesalination of seawater, and cutting-edge membrane \r\ntechnology to reclaim waste water into high-grade, \r\nultra-clean water, which we call “NEWater”. When \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Singapore in \r\nMarch 2012, he was impressed enough by our water \r\nmanagement to make a toast with NEWater, rather \r\nthan wine, calling NEWater, “something far more \r\nvaluable — the elixir of life”.\r\nLet me now turn to the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and suggest three priority areas. First, we should \r\nlearn from the example of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We should avoid being prescriptive. As each \r\ncountry is unique, countries should be allowed to \r\nexercise f lexibility as to which goals they choose to \r\nprioritize and how they will achieve them. The new \r\nglobal development road map should have poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development at its centre \r\nand should converge around a single, clear set of \r\npractical and quantifiable goals. We should keep to \r\nthat outcomes-based approach and not forget that the \r\n6/7 13-48911\r\nA/68/PV.20 28/09/2013\r\nvision of the Balkans working together, as the Prime \r\nMinister said, in spite of our history of so much war \r\nand conflict.\r\nUnfortunately, in his statement today we also \r\nheard references praising a unilateral action that \r\nconstitutes an infringement of the basic principles of \r\nthe Organization and a clear violation of the United \r\nNations Charter and the resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, as well as being contrary to the core principles \r\nand norms of international law. Such an approach \r\nis counterproductive and runs contrary to all the \r\nefforts that have been invested so far in achieving a \r\nsustainable solution to the situation in our southern \r\nprovince of Kosovo and Metohija, particularly those \r\nmade following the signing of the First Agreement on \r\nPrinciples Governing the Normalization of Relations \r\nonly six months ago.\r\nLet me point out that the Agreement, brokered \r\nthrough the significant facilitation efforts of Baroness \r\nAshton, the High Representative of the European \r\nUnion for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, provides \r\na framework for reaching practical and sustainable \r\nsolutions to the issues burdening the daily life of \r\nthe people in the province and in no way implies a \r\nrecognition by Serbia of a unilateral pact. As stated by \r\nthe President of Serbia, His Excellency Mr. Tomislav \r\nNikolić, Belgrade and Pristina have reached agreement \r\nonly over clearly defined matters such as municipal \r\nelections and the establishment of the community of \r\nSerbian municipalities in Kosovo and Metohija. The \r\nRepublic of Serbia has not and will not recognize either \r\nde jure or de facto the independence of Kosovo.\r\nThe call for recognition as heard today, at a time \r\nwhen we are in the midst of investing efforts through \r\ncourage and wisdom, in the words of the Prime \r\nMinister of Albania, is contrary to the ongoing process. \r\nFurthermore, it will not contribute favourably to the \r\nstrengthening of confidence and the improvement of \r\nrelations between the States of the Balkans.\r\nFinally, let me reiterate that the issue of resolving \r\nthe status of our southern province is one of my \r\nGovernment’s foremost priorities. Time and again, \r\nwe have demonstrated our readiness and willingness \r\nto make an active contribution to overcoming the \r\naccumulated problems in the aforementioned political \r\ndialogue in Brussels. My country has shown great \r\nf lexibility in trying to bring about a solution acceptable \r\nto all and one that takes into account the legitimate \r\ninterests of all communities in Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nGovernment officials from 170 countries have received \r\ntraining under the Programme in areas as diverse as \r\nsustainable urban development, water management \r\nand human-resource development. To support our \r\nengagement in the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nwe will develop and customize new programmes on \r\nsustainable development and climate change that meet \r\nthe needs of SIDS and least developed countries.\r\nSingapore has also been working with other \r\nGovernments to promote sustainable development \r\ninternationally. In 2007, Singapore and China embarked \r\non a joint project to develop the Sino-Singapore \r\nTianjin Eco-city, which is envisioned as a city that \r\nwill be socially harmonious, environmentally friendly \r\nand resource-efficient. That will become a model \r\nfor sustainable urbanization in China. By 2020, \r\nthe Eco-city is intended to be a low-carbon, green-\r\nliving environment approximately half the size of \r\nManhattan, housing around 350,000 people. Singapore \r\nwill continue to share its experience in sustainable \r\nurbanization through Singapore-led events such as the \r\nbiennial Singapore International Water Week and the \r\nWorld Cities Summit.\r\nThe only way to secure our collective future \r\nis through poverty eradication and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The next two years will be critical for the \r\nworld as we embark on an ambitious journey to map out \r\nthe post-2015 agenda. The United Nations must play a \r\nleading role, and we are fully committed to working \r\nclosely with other Member States to achieve that.\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who wish to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. May I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMrs. Lalić Smajević (Serbia): My delegation \r\nwould like to exercise its right of reply in response to \r\nthe statement made today (see A/68/PV.18) by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Albania, His Excellency \r\nMr. Edi Rama.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to underline \r\nonce again before the General Assembly that the \r\nconsolidation of regional peace, security and stability is \r\na priority of the highest order for the Republic of Serbia. \r\nIt is in that context that we would like to emphasize that \r\nthe Republic of Serbia fully shares the approach and \r\n13-48911 7/7\r\n28/09/2013 A/68/PV.20\r\nrelations in various fields and accordingly resolve any \r\nmisunderstanding between our two countries.\r\nMr. Aljasmi (United Arab Emirates) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I am compelled to exercise the right of reply \r\nin response to the illegal and false allegations made by \r\nIran claiming its sovereignty over islands that belong to \r\nthe United Arab Emirates — Abu Musa, Greater Tunb \r\nand Lesser Tunb. In that regard, I would like to reiterate \r\nthat my Government has, time and again, expressed \r\nits inalterable position with respect to those occupied \r\nislands. We express our strong disappointment over \r\nthe annual statements made by the Iranian delegation \r\nin this Hall and the allegations that run counter to all \r\nhistorical fact and to the demographic, geographical \r\nand legal records that prove the ownership of the three \r\nislands by the United Arab Emirates.\r\nConsequently, the United Arab Emirates will never \r\nabandon its legal, historical and political claim to those \r\nislands. We consider them  to be under our national \r\nsovereignty and to be part and parcel of our territorial \r\nunity and integrity. We express our categorical \r\nrejection of all escalating and illegal measures taken by \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran with respect to the three \r\nislands in the course of the past four decades.\r\nIn conclusion, the United Arab Emirates reiterates \r\nits appeal to the international community to urge \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to solve the problem \r\nthrough the means suggested previously, that is, direct \r\nnegotiations, arbitration or recourse to the International \r\nCourt of Justice, so that the matter can be decided in a \r\nmanner that is consistent with international law.\r\nOnce again, we would like to repeat that stability \r\nand economic prosperity in the Arab Gulf region \r\nnecessitate the establishment of good-neighbourliness \r\nin accordance with the principles of respect for \r\nthe independence and sovereignty of States and of \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.50 p.m.\r\nMr. Alibabaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): In his \r\nstatement at this meeting, the Minister for Foreign of \r\nAffairs of the United Arab Emirates used a fabricated \r\nand unacceptable name for the term “Persian Gulf”. In \r\nexercising the right of reply, I would like to very briefly \r\nemphasize that, as the Assembly is certainly aware, \r\nit is an undisputed historical fact that the full term \r\n“Persian Gulf” has always been used as the standard \r\ngeographical designation for the sea area between \r\nthe Arabian peninsula and the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. Countless maps drawn by various regional and \r\ninternational institutions in the past several hundred \r\nyears all testify to that point. Moreover, the United \r\nNations practice over the past half-century has made \r\nit crystal clear that the term “Persian Gulf” is the \r\nonly geographical designation applicable to that body \r\nof water and that it should be used in full without \r\nany exception when that body of water is referred to. \r\nTherefore, any use of a fabricated name for that body of \r\nwater is totally groundless and absolutely unacceptable \r\nand without any legal basis whatsoever.\r\nThe Minister for Foreign Affairs of the United Arab \r\nEmirates also raised some unacceptable and unfounded \r\nclaims about the three Iranian islands located in the \r\nPersian Gulf, namely, Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and \r\nLesser Tunb. I would like to state that the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran reiterates its full claim to sovereignty \r\nover the Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and \r\nLesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf and categorically rejects \r\nany claim to the contrary. My delegation underlines that \r\nthe measures undertaken in those islands by Iranian \r\nofficials have always been based on the principles of \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of my country.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has also pursued a \r\npolicy of friendship and good-neighbourliness with \r\nits neighbours. In that context, my country continues \r\nto stand ready to undertake bilateral discussions with \r\nthe relevant officials in order to strengthen those \r\n"
