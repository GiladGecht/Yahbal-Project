"In the absence of the President, Mr. Tommo Monthe \r\n(Cameroon), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. John Baird, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Canada.\r\nMr. Baird (Canada): As we gather near Ground \r\nZero, site of the World Trade Center mass murder, I \r\nwish first to honour the victims of terrorism. I honour \r\nall victims everywhere, including those killed and \r\nwounded at the Westgate Shopping Mall in Nairobi.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTragically, we lost two Canadians in Nairobi, including \r\none of our diplomats. There is no more fitting venue to \r\nhonour the life of Annemarie Desloges and her service \r\nthan right here at the United Nations. The crime of \r\nterror is an assault on all people. In its wake, the human \r\nfamily is one — united in pain, mourning and our \r\nresolve that we will never allow evil to triumph.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAt this moment of grief, the oneness of humankind is \r\nthe theme of my remarks today.\r\nAllow me to begin with an observation drawn from \r\nthe Canadian experience. The province of Newfoundland \r\nand Labrador was the last province to join Canada, but \r\nit is the site of the earliest known European settlement \r\nin the New World. L’Anse aux Meadows is more than \r\n1,000 years old. We consider the province’s capital city, \r\nSt. John’s, to be the oldest English settlement in North \r\nAmerica, dating back to 1497.\r\nThe early Newfoundland settlements are the \r\nsubject of significant archeological activity. Among the \r\nartifacts commonly found is a three-handled drinking \r\nmug known as a tyg. The three handles are designed \r\nfor sharing. During the seventeenth century, it was \r\ncommon to share eating and drinking utensils. Further \r\nresearch reveals that the tyg is not unique to Canadian \r\nand English history. On the contrary, cups with three \r\nor more handles are common to many of the world’s \r\ncultures. Indeed, nearly three millennia ago, Homer \r\nwrote in the Iliad of a multi-handled mug. The tyg and \r\nits many counterparts around the world are tangible \r\nreminders not just of the fact that eating and drinking are \r\nsocial activities, but that, as long as human beings have \r\ninhabited this planet, sustenance and the necessaries of \r\nlife have been community endeavours. Human beings \r\nshare out of necessity. We cooperate to survive. We \r\nform communities because that is our natural state. As \r\nCicero observed, we were born to unite with our fellow \r\nmen and to join in community with the human race.\r\nAnimated by the same spirit of community, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations declares that our goals \r\ninclude to live together, to be neighbours and to unite. \r\nThe very first words of the Charter of the United \r\nNations make clear that the Organization is a body of, \r\nby and for human beings. It begins, “We the peoples \r\nof the United Nations” — not “We the countries” or \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.21\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n21st plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 30 September 2013, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The effects of early forced \r\nmarriage are documented and beyond dispute. Early \r\nforced marriage harms health, halts education, destroys \r\nopportunity and enslaves women in a life of poverty. A \r\nyoung woman once recounted her wedding date. She \r\nremembered, “It was the day I left school”. No country \r\nis immune from this scourge.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThis is a global problem — a problem for humankind. \r\nForced marriage is rape — an act of violence against \r\nwomen. Early forced marriage is child rape — an act of \r\nviolence against young girls. The practice is abhorrent \r\nand indefensible. We condemn it, even though some \r\nmight prefer that we kept quiet. The discomfort of the \r\npublic is of small concern, particularly in the context of \r\na crime that calls to heaven for justice.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIf the United Nations does not act to protect young \r\ngirls, who will?\r\nAnother way to protect the vulnerable is to improve \r\nthe health of mothers, newborns and children so that \r\nwe can reduce the number of deaths. I would like to say \r\nhow proud I am of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen \r\nHarper for having led a global effort — the Muskoka \r\nInitiative — to reduce maternal and infant mortality \r\nand to improve the health of mothers and children in \r\nthe world’s poorest countries. That is about half of the \r\nworld’s population, and all of its potential.\r\nWhile those efforts, to eradicate sexual violence \r\nin conflict, to eliminate early forced marriage and to \r\nimprove maternal and newborn health are essential, \r\nwe must do more than react to crises. We must invest \r\nin opportunities for women and young girls. We must \r\nensure that women participate fully in all parts of our \r\nsociety and in all the countries of the United Nations. \r\nThat will help us build a stronger, more secure, more \r\nprosperous and more peaceful world. It is in every \r\nnation’s self-interest to ensure every young girl realizes \r\nher full potential. And it is from the perspective of the \r\nhuman family, one family, that we must address other \r\nthreats to peace and security.\r\nAmong the most urgent crises remains the violence \r\nin Syria. Canada’s position is clear: we support the \r\n“We the Governments” or “We the political leaders”, \r\nbut “We the peoples”. That is an important reminder of \r\nwhy and on whose behalf we are all here today.\r\nAt the United Nations, Canada targets its efforts \r\non securing tangible results for the human family. It \r\nis much more important to consider what the United \r\nNations is achieving than how the United Nations \r\narranges its affairs. Canada’s Government does not \r\nseek to have our values or our principled foreign policy \r\nvalidated by elites who would rather go along to get \r\nalong. The billions who are hungry, or lack access to \r\nclean water, or are displaced, or cannot read and write \r\ndo not care how many members sit on the Security \r\nCouncil. But they do need to know that their brothers \r\nand sisters in humankind will walk with them through \r\nthe darkness.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nPeace, prosperity and freedom are the conditions \r\nthat have been sought by human communities from the \r\nbeginning of recorded time: to live in peace, to live in \r\nprosperity, to live in freedom.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOf those priorities peace is the foremost objective of \r\nthe United Nations. It is no surprise that the Charter \r\nof the United Nations mentions the word peace four \r\ndozen times. Sadly, peace the word is easier to locate \r\nthan peace the condition. Since the moment the \r\nOrganization was created, not a day has passed without \r\nthe human family being pained by war somewhere on \r\nthe planet. Almost always, the suffering is felt by the \r\nmost vulnerable among us. Far too often, that involves \r\nwomen and violence.\r\nIn the context of war, rape and serious sexual \r\nviolence are war crimes. I have met girls who were \r\nvictims of that very war crime, and their stories are \r\nabsolutely horrific. The war criminals involved must be \r\nidentified, pursued, prosecuted and punished.  Earlier \r\nthis year, Canada and other Group of Eight nations \r\nagreed to treat sexual violence in conflict as a violation \r\nof the Geneva Conventions. I applaud the United \r\nKingdom and Foreign Secretary William Hague for \r\ntheir work in this very important area. But he would be \r\nthe first to acknowledge that the fight to eradicate this \r\ncrime has been led by women, including the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Sexual \r\nViolence in Conflict, Ms. Zainab Hawa Bangura.\r\n13-48917 3/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nlike most other nations, in their sovereign Jewish State. \r\nAnd like all other nations, Israel has the right to defend \r\nitself, by itself.\r\nCanada fundamentally believes peace is achievable \r\nand that Palestinians and Israelis and their neighbours \r\ncan live side by side in peace and security. We, like \r\nmany nations, wish to see a prosperous Palestinian State \r\nliving in peace with its Jewish neighbour. That is why, \r\nalthough at times we have fundamental differences \r\non how statehood is achieved, Canada is providing \r\nsignificant assistance to build the institutions that are \r\nvital to the establishment of a viable future State. In the \r\nWest Bank, Canada is contributing greatly to economic, \r\nsecurity and justice initiatives.\r\nRecent developments in negotiations between Israel \r\nand the Palestinian Authority are indeed encouraging. \r\nI want to salute the leadership and courage of the \r\nIsraeli Prime Minister and the Palestinian Authority’s \r\nPresident. I commend United States Secretary of State \r\nJohn Kerry for his personal leadership in this area. We \r\nmust all commit ourselves to this cause, united by the \r\nprospect of peace.\r\nI look forward to the day when Israeli and \r\nPalestinian children can live side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity in a Jewish and in a Palestinian State.\r\nDialogue is important, yes. But our dialogue must \r\nbe a prelude to action, and action must mean achieving \r\nresults. Action must mean making a difference. If we \r\ntake the recent statements coming from the regime in \r\nIran, some observers see encouraging signs, but sound \r\nbites do not remove threats to global security. Kind \r\nwords, a smile and a charm offensive are not a substitute \r\nfor real action. We will welcome and acknowledge \r\nreform, if and when it comes. By the following test \r\nwe will know when genuine reform has occurred: has \r\nthere been real, measurable, material improvement in \r\nthe lives of the Iranian people and in the security of the \r\nworld? Not yet. We will judge the regime on the basis \r\nof its actions and results.\r\nThe five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil plus Germany have had five rounds of formal \r\nnegotiations with Iran in the past two years. While \r\neveryone says the meetings have been productive, the \r\nfact remains we have not seen any change in Iran’s \r\nactions. Next year, nothing would make Canada more \r\npleased than to see a change in Iran’s nuclear ambitions, \r\na change to its terrible human rights record and an end \r\nSyrian people, the innocent people caught up in this \r\nsenseless violence and those who show great courage in \r\nworking on their behalf. We will never support a brutal \r\nand illegitimate regime that has unleashed weapons of \r\nmass destruction on its own people. Nor will we tolerate \r\nextremism and terrorism as alternatives to Al-Assad’s \r\ntyranny.\r\nThe people of Canada have been generous in \r\nhelping those most in need. When success is achieved, \r\nI believe that it is important to recognize it. The near-\r\nimpossible work of the World Food Programme must \r\nbe applauded, and Canada has responded by being the \r\nsecond-largest single-country donor in the world. Its \r\nwork in Syria is paramount and has not gone unnoticed. \r\nI also commend the work of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees in providing \r\nassistance to the refugees f leeing that terrible conflict, \r\nas well as the generosity of Syria’s neighbours in \r\nproviding safe haven.\r\nCanada joins the entire world in seeking a political \r\nresolution to the conflict. Canada supports a peaceful, \r\ndemocratic and pluralistic Syria that protects the rights \r\nof all communities. But let us not confuse a peaceful, \r\nnegotiated outcome with equivocation or moral \r\nuncertainty. There can be no moral ambiguity about the \r\nuse of chemical weapons, particularly against civilians.\r\nToday, 30 September, is a dark reminder of the \r\nprice of accommodation with evil. It is the seventy-\r\nfifth anniversary of the Munich Agreement, by which \r\nCzechoslovakia’s freedom was sacrificed to appease \r\nthe Nazi regime. The appeasers claimed they had won \r\npeace in our time. In fact, their abandoning of principle \r\nwas a calamity for the world. Nobel Peace Prize winner \r\nElie Wiesel, a Holocaust survivor who was imprisoned \r\nat Auschwitz, has been even blunter:\r\n“Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. \r\nSilence encourages the tormentor, never the \r\ntormented. Sometimes we must interfere. When \r\nhuman lives are endangered, when human dignity \r\nis in jeopardy, national borders and sensitivities \r\nbecome irrelevant.”\r\nJust as we are not neutral or silent on the crimes \r\nbeing committed against the Syrian people, neither is \r\nCanada neutral on Israel’s right to exist and to defend \r\nitself. There can be no bargaining over Israel’s existence. \r\nWhile dialogue is a virtue, there can be no virtuous \r\ndiscussion with anyone wedded to Israel’s destruction. \r\nToday, the Jewish people are masters of their own fate, \r\n4/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nof members of the human family who cannot even begin \r\nto contemplate prosperity until a more basic need, their \r\nneed for security, is addressed.\r\nThe global family will never achieve the prosperity \r\nthat is our full potential unless we address the peace and \r\nsecurity concerns that constrain human opportunity. \r\nEveryone has an interest in contributing to the solution, \r\nbecause peace and prosperity ultimately ensure the \r\nfreedom of the individual. That is why we need the \r\npeople of these United Nations gathered here to promote \r\nthat freedom: freedom from oppression, freedom from \r\ndiscrimination, freedom to worship, to think, to speak, \r\nto love, to believe — freedom to be.\r\nHuman freedom can be exercised and, sadly, \r\nlimited in far too many ways. Religious persecution \r\ncontinues in too many places. Since we gathered \r\nhere last year, the world has witnessed bombings of \r\nmosques in Iraq and Pakistan and Catholic churches in \r\nTanzania; attacks against Hindu, Buddhist and Muslim \r\nplaces of worship in Burma and Bangladesh; the bloody \r\npersecution of Christians in Syria; attacks on Coptic \r\nChristian churches in Egypt; attacks on a mosque \r\nand on a Catholic church in Sri Lanka; the detention \r\nof Sri Lankan Muslim leader Azad Sally; the murders \r\nof Catholic worshippers in Nigeria; and the Iranian \r\nregime’s ongoing persecution of the Baha’i.\r\nCanada this year opened an Office of Religious \r\nFreedom. Its mandate is to promote freedom of religion \r\nand belief as a foreign policy priority, and to combat the \r\nenslavement into fear by those who seek to intimidate \r\nand undermine the right to worship freely in peace \r\nand in harmony. We reject the pernicious notion that \r\nhuman dignity can be sliced up, compartmentalized or \r\ncompromised. In a pluralistic society, it is impossible \r\nto protect some human rights and freedoms while \r\ninfringing others. All freedoms are rooted in the \r\ninherent dignity of human beings.\r\nWhether the issue is religious freedom, sexual \r\nfreedom, political freedom or any other freedom, \r\nsome people ask: What business is it of ours? What \r\ninterest do we have in events outside our borders? \r\nOur business is a shared humanity. Our interest is the \r\ndignity of humankind. Many assaults on human dignity \r\nhave common roots. I refer to neo-fascist ideology \r\nmasquerading in different forms, and the threat that it \r\nposes to individual freedom.\r\nI spoke earlier of the anniversary of the Munich \r\nAgreement. What the signatories claimed as a triumph \r\nto its material support for terrorism, including for \r\nHizbullah.\r\nNow is the time for the global community to \r\nmaintain tough sanctions against Iran so that the country \r\ntakes a different path on its nuclear programme. The \r\nIranian people want peace, and they are suffering great \r\nhardship because of their Government. Canada wants \r\nthe Iranian people to be able to access a life of freedom \r\nand prosperity for themselves.\r\nHow do we as a human family achieve and maintain \r\nprosperity? We do so through free trade among open \r\nsocieties operating under transparent, consistent and \r\nfair rules. Canada continues to diversify its markets \r\nbecause it is a trading nation. We are aggressively \r\npursuing free-trade agreements with other nations. \r\nBounded by three oceans, with the second-largest land \r\nmass in the world, Canada is literally open to the world. \r\nWe are both deepening existing economic relationships \r\nand building new ones. Whether with China, which \r\nis now Canada’s second-largest trading partner, or \r\nthe countries of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations, where Canadian trade and investment ties are \r\ndramatically increasing, or the Pacific Alliance, which \r\nprovides new and exciting opportunities, or the European \r\nUnion, where we are negotiating a comprehensive free \r\ntrade agreement, Canada and Canadians are supporting \r\nmarket liberalization. In the process, ordinary lives are \r\nbecoming enriched and entire societies stronger.\r\nBut the quest for prosperity must never come at the \r\nexpense of our commitment to freedom. Prosperity is \r\ninextricably linked to peace. After all, those who lack \r\nsecurity usually lack the means to provide for themselves \r\nand their families. With economic opportunity, a fruit \r\nvendor in Tunisia may not have felt compelled to end his \r\nlife seeking the dignity to provide for his own family. A \r\nyoung man in Afghanistan may never feel compelled to \r\njoin terrorist elements simply to raise his children and \r\nensure that their lives are better than the one he lived.\r\nI will always remember the 7-year old girl that I \r\nmet at Zaatari refugee camp, in Jordan. Her parents \r\nhad made the difficult decision to leave their home and \r\nto seek refuge in another country, braving hardship \r\nbecause they were motivated, like all parents, by the \r\ndesire to keep their family safe. I asked the young girl \r\nhow she was doing. With tears in her eyes, she said \r\nsimply, “I do not like it here. I want to go home.” It was \r\nabsolutely heartwrenching. And millions of people are \r\nin the same tragic position around the world — millions \r\n13-48917 5/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nI express my gratitude and appreciation to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his skilful and \r\njudicious management of the sixty-seventh session of \r\nthe General Assembly. I would like also to strongly \r\ncommend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ntireless efforts to strengthen the United Nations and \r\nuphold its principles despite formidable difficulties \r\nand increasing challenges. We pledge our full support \r\nto him in his endeavours to enhance the role of the \r\nOrganization and its peacebuilding capacities in the \r\nface of such major challenges.\r\nWe extend our heartfelt condolences to the people \r\nand the friendly Government of Pakistan for the loss \r\nof hundreds of lives as a result of the earthquake that \r\nhit south-western Pakistan. We pray for their souls and \r\nextend our sympathy to their families. We condemn \r\nthe terrorist act that targeted a commercial centre in \r\nKenya’s capital, Nairobi, and deeply regret the scores \r\nof innocent victims who lost their lives as a result of \r\nthat cowardly act.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain firmly believes that it is \r\nimperative to link peace to development. That concept \r\nhas been acknowledged in and by all United Nations \r\nbodies for decades, and must now be enhanced and \r\nimplemented at all levels. That is why the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain is working to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015, as a top priority of its \r\ndevelopment programme.\r\nThe most recent report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/68/1) presents us with \r\nan accurate and concrete portrait of global problems in \r\nall their complexity. Those problems require effective \r\nsolutions, particularly as we approach the 2015 deadline. \r\nIn our view, therefore, the President’s choice for the \r\ntheme of this session, “The post-2015 development \r\nagenda: setting the stage”, is apt and well considered, \r\ncalling as it does for a collective effort to attain the \r\ngoals we seek, based on the recommendations contained \r\nin the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, A New \r\nGlobal Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform \r\nEconomies through Sustainable Development, in order \r\nto ensure sustainable development. It also suggests the \r\ncreation of a monitoring mechanism, under the auspices \r\nof the Economic and Social Council, to follow up on \r\nall recommendations made by relevant conferences \r\non issues related to sustainable development, for the \r\nbenefit of future generations.\r\nof practical politics was in fact a craven capitulation \r\nthat betrayed human dignity and bankrupted the \r\npeace it purported to secure. It was wrong then to \r\nunderestimate and to appease fascism, just as it is now \r\nto underestimate its modern incarnation. Extremism \r\nthat subjugates human dignity and crushes individual \r\nfreedom beneath rigid ideology must be opposed for \r\nwhat it is.\r\nOne year ago, the world lost the great Somali poet \r\nknown as Gaarriye. Although his pen has been silenced, \r\nthe inspiring words remain. He wrote: “And tell them \r\nthis: our purpose is peace; our password ‘freedom’; \r\nour aim, equality; our way, the way of light.”. In \r\nother words, peace, prosperity and freedom — three \r\nuniversal human priorities. Like the three handles of a \r\nmug from which we all drink, they are three values that \r\nall humankind shares.\r\nAs I close, I cannot help but reflect on the three \r\nyoung girls, and my heart breaks for them: the child \r\nbride who said, “It was the day I left schoo.”; the young \r\ngirl who was a victim of rape and sexual violence; the \r\nrefugee who said, “I just want to go home”. We are not \r\nhere to achieve results for Governments or political \r\nleaders. We are here to protect and defend those three \r\ngirls and 7 billion other members of the human family. \r\nLet us remember that as we embark on discussions to \r\nshape a new global agenda, focusing on those most in \r\nneed.\r\nI am confident that everyone here feels the \r\noverwhelming honour and privilege it is to serve \r\nour people. It is not without great challenge and \r\nresponsibility, but we all must stand up and deliver on \r\nthat unique mandate for the people, for it is the people \r\nwho expect nothing less.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nShaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain.\r\nShaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): It gives me great pleasure at the outset \r\nto congratulate Mr. Ashe on his election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session \r\nand to pay tribute to his friendly country, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda. I am confident that his vast diplomatic \r\nexperience, with which I am personally familiar, \r\nand thorough knowledge of international affairs will \r\nguarantee the smooth conduct and success of our work \r\nat this session.\r\n6/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nthat encompasses other strategic partnerships through \r\ndialogue with political Powers and economic groups \r\nsuch as the United States, the United Kingdom, the \r\nEuropean Union, the Russian Federation, China, Japan, \r\nIndia and the member States of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations, with a view to playing an active \r\nrole in consolidating the principles of international \r\ncooperation and friendly relations between nations and \r\npeoples.\r\nIn that context, our principal goal is to spare \r\nhumankind the scourges of war, conflict and disasters. \r\nWe therefore call for the establishment in the Middle \r\nEast, including the Arabian Gulf region, of a zone free \r\nof weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear \r\nweapons, and for compliance with the criteria and \r\nsafeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, \r\nespecially those related to nuclear safety. In that regard, \r\nwe support the efforts of the five permanent members \r\nof the Security Council and Germany to work with the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to reach a swift settlement \r\nof the issue of the Iranian nuclear programme issue, \r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, while \r\nguaranteeing the right of all States to enjoy the fruits \r\nof nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. We \r\nreiterate the importance of convening an international \r\nconference on establishing a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, \r\nin the Middle East, originally proposed for 2012, in \r\naccordance with the resolution adopted at the May 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nConsistent with the principles and purposes we all \r\nendeavour to uphold in the context of our cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations in order to improve stability \r\nin sensitive regions, we reaffirm our utter rejection \r\nof terrorism, extremism and violence in all their \r\nmanifestations and forms, irrespective of their reasons, \r\nmotives, justifications or sources. We also condemn \r\nall terrorist acts that threaten regional peace and \r\nstability, and noted the need to add groups such as the \r\nLebanese Hizbullah to the list of international terrorist \r\norganizations, in view of their criminal acts aimed at \r\nterrorizing peaceful civilians and creating instability \r\nand chaos.\r\nWe are committed to seeking peace, cooperation and \r\nsecurity for our countries, within the framework of both \r\ninternational and regional structures and organizations \r\nby cooperating with our allies from other friendly \r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain is located in the \r\nArabian Gulf, a region of vital strategic importance \r\nthat has been a crossroads of world civilizations \r\nsince time immemorial. The countries of the region \r\nare experiencing one of the most prosperous eras \r\nin their history, building a society based on justice \r\nand development in every dimension — political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural. As successive United \r\nNations Development Programme annual reports have \r\nreflected, the region ranks high on the indices of human \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, we reaffirm our keen desire \r\nto continue making steady progress in development for \r\nthe benefit of the peoples of our region, harnessing the \r\nformidable progress that has been made in information \r\nand communication technologies, as well as in dealing \r\nwith issues pertaining to security, environment, natural \r\nresources and population.\r\nAs a vital part of the world, our region seeks to \r\nconsolidate a new concept of regional security that \r\nemphasizes the region’s geopolitical situation and \r\nconsiders security in relation to humanitarian needs, \r\nfood and water. It also considers security in the context \r\nof existing coalitions that link the region to friendly \r\ncountries through strategic and historic agreements \r\nthat emphasize human, food and water security and that \r\nare designed to reinforce stability, enhance dialogue \r\nand promote a culture of peace, friendship and mutual \r\nrespect.\r\nWe in the Kingdom of Bahrain and the other \r\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries have \r\ndesignated three important strategic pillars that guide \r\nour interaction with one another and help us to make \r\nprogress, build healthy and sustainable relations with \r\nour neighbours, engage with the world at large and \r\nrespond to new developments and challenges. Those \r\npillars are axes for the world politics of today on a planet \r\ncharacterized by globalization and fruitful cooperation \r\nbetween its nations. In our view, therefore, the first \r\npillar is regional partnership in the field of security, \r\namong ourselves and with our world partners. We \r\nin the GCC system work together to preserve our \r\nshared stability and security within a framework of \r\ncoordination, cooperation and complementarity that \r\nresults in the unity we seek. Our partnerships extend \r\nacross the Arab and Islamic world. Here in the United \r\nNations we continue to pursue such partnerships in \r\nthe cause of maintaining world peace and security. We \r\nfind political and economic solutions to many global \r\nproblems within a multilateral cooperative framework \r\n13-48917 7/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nlaunched by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, \r\nKing Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of Saudi \r\nArabia, and endorsed at the Arab Summit in Beirut in \r\n2002. We still believe that that initiative presents an \r\nimportant opportunity to secure peace, security and \r\na bright future for the Palestinian and Israeli peoples \r\non the basis of coexistence, cooperation and good \r\nneighbourliness between the Arab States and Israel.\r\nWe look forward to overcoming wars and \r\nanimosity. For centuries Arabs, Muslims, Christians \r\nand Jews lived side by side in the region and forged \r\ntheir common history in a framework of coexistence \r\nand tolerance based on mutual respect for each other’s \r\nbeliefs, culture and religion. The Arab Peace Initiative \r\nstipulates that the Palestinian people must enjoy all \r\nthe full and legitimate rights enjoyed by other peoples \r\nof the world. It reaches out to the Israeli people with \r\nguarantees of security designed to reassure them \r\nagainst any threat or danger to their existence. In that \r\nrespect, we fully support President Mahmoud Abbas in \r\nhis sincere endeavours to achieve the aspirations of his \r\npeople. He is one of the best leaders ever born in the \r\nland of Palestine and deserves our support in each of \r\nhis steps toward the attainment of the desired peace.\r\nToday, we reaffirm our support for the tireless and \r\nsincere efforts of United States Secretary of State John \r\nKerry to relaunch the peace process between Israel and \r\nPalestine in order to reach a permanent solution on the \r\nbasis of international law, the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, the two-State solution, the creation of an \r\nindependent Palestinian State on the basis of the 4 June \r\n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and \r\nany agreed swaps of territory between the two parties. \r\nWe look forward to seeing an end to the oppression of \r\nPalestinians, the lifting of the Gaza blockade and to \r\na halt in the building of settlements. We welcome the \r\ncorrect stance of the European Union whereby it refuses \r\nto acknowledge the legitimacy of Israeli settlements \r\nbuilt on Palestinian territory and suspends all financial \r\ndealings with such settlements.\r\nThe third pillar is the need to attain the aspirations of \r\nour peoples. Foremost among these are the need to raise \r\nliving standards, to bring about peace and stability, and \r\nto ensure respect for human rights through pluralism, \r\ndemocracy and the participation of all in a continued \r\ndialogue that takes into account the cultural values of a \r\nsociety and the levels of political, economic, social and \r\ncultural development of its peoples.\r\ncountries to ensure freedom of maritime navigation \r\nin the Arabian Gulf and to protect commercial vessels \r\nfrom piracy off the coast of Somalia and the Horn of \r\nAfrica and in the Gulf of Aden. We also contribute to \r\npeacekeeping and stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.\r\nWe stand by the sisterly Arab Republic of Egypt \r\nand support its efforts to achieve stability and security, \r\nrightfully defend its vital interests, implement a road \r\nmap that can lead it to safety and propose clear steps to \r\nmeet the aspirations of the Egyptian people and restore \r\nEgypt’s leading role in the Middle East.\r\nWe also reiterate our principled position of \r\nunwavering support for and solidarity with the sisterly \r\nKingdom of Morocco regarding its territorial integrity \r\nand a settlement of the Western Sahara problem, \r\nin accordance with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions.\r\nThe second of our three strategic pillars encompasses \r\nsupport for the principles of good-neighbourliness, \r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of others, \r\nabiding by the provisions of international law and its \r\ninstruments and peaceful coexistence. We are also \r\neager to take advantage of opportunities to put those \r\nprinciples into practice, in responding to the challenges \r\nwe face and transforming them into opportunities to \r\nprotect the region from tensions, threats and instability.\r\nThe first of those challenges is the important task \r\nof putting an end to Iranian intervention in the internal \r\naffairs of the countries of the region and to its occupation \r\nof the three Emirates islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser \r\nTunb and Abu Musa. We ask that the repeated calls of \r\nthe sisterly United Arab Emirates for a just solution to \r\nthat question be heeded, either through serious direct \r\nnegotiations between the two countries or by referral \r\nto the International Court of Justice for arbitration, in \r\nconformity with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe provisions of international law. In the face of that \r\nchallenge, we look forward to new, clear and positive \r\nstatements and initiatives from the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran that can help to end the tensions and instability \r\nin the region and contribute to confidence-building, \r\ncooperation and the establishment of friendly relations \r\nbased on good-neighbourliness and mutual interests.\r\nThe second challenge concerns the Palestinian \r\nquestion, and the need to arrive at a just, permanent and \r\ncomprehensive solution that guarantees the legitimate \r\nrights of the Palestinian people. That challenge has led \r\nto an important opportunity, the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\n8/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nthe Arab peoples. This initiative represents a qualitative \r\nstride for the region and conforms to the rule of law \r\nand similar practices in other parts of the world. For \r\nthe first time in modern Arab history, we will have a \r\ncourt to establish a solid foundation for the protection \r\nof human rights in the Arab world.\r\nOur national fund will compensate those affected \r\nby events, and the general secretariat will address \r\ngrievances within the Ministry of Interior operating as \r\nan autonomous body within the framework of national \r\nlaws and professional policing standards, as stipulated \r\nin the police code of conduct.\r\nIn response to the aspirations of the Arab peoples, \r\nthe GCC countries have spared no effort to achieve \r\npeace and security and to restore stability in some \r\nArab countries facing serious challenges of late. In that \r\nrespect, in Yemen a GCC initiative led to the national \r\nconsensus dialogue towards a peaceful settlement of \r\nthe crisis, in line with the aspirations and expectations \r\nof the brotherly Yemeni people to achieve security and \r\nstability in their land.\r\nEager to see stability restored in the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, and cognizant of the right of the Syrian \r\npeople to choose their own political system, we support \r\nthe current diplomatic steps towards destroying the \r\nSyrian chemical arsenal and the agreement reached \r\nin Geneva between the United States and the Russian \r\nFederation. We welcome Security Council resolution \r\n2118 (2013) of 27 September, which calls on all parties \r\nconcerned to take serious and concrete steps to address \r\nthe Syrian crisis and its repercussions, particularly \r\nparagraphs 16 and 17 related to the transitional period \r\nand the implementation of the Geneva communiqué \r\n(S/2012/523, annex).\r\nAll of these efforts should be complemented \r\nby an integrated political process so as to meet the \r\naspirations of the Syrian people to democracy and \r\npolitical pluralism. We call on the United Nations \r\nand the international community to shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities by taking the appropriate deterrent \r\nmeasures to halt the serious violations of human rights \r\nto which the Syrian people have been subject, and to put \r\nan end to the crimes of genocide being perpetrated with \r\nall kinds of lethal weapons, which have claimed more \r\nthan 100,000 martyrs, injured many more, and created \r\nmillions of refugees and internally displaced persons.\r\nI will not speak at further length, but I would like \r\nto assure the Assembly that the Kingdom of Bahrain, \r\nThroughout the modern history and for over \r\ntwo centuries, the Kingdom of Bahrain has been \r\neager to interact with its people and to engage in a \r\ndialogue with them based on full transparency and \r\ncommitment. Ever since His Majesty King Hamad bin \r\nIssa Al-Khalifa assumed the leadership of the country, \r\nthe Kingdom has pursued a steadfast policy of laying \r\nthe foundations of a modern, independent, sovereign \r\nState based on sustainability, competitiveness, justice \r\nand a commitment to constitutional and legislative \r\nreforms. Such reforms have encompassed every aspect \r\nof political, economic, social and cultural life, as well \r\nas human rights and an enhanced role for women \r\nin building a society faithful to its values, culture, \r\naccomplishments and heritage.\r\nThe King’s achievements are attributable to \r\ngood governance and to his support for intellectual, \r\npolitical and organizational efforts to create \r\ndemocratic institutions that give everyone a chance \r\nto use their talents and creativity as active citizens of \r\nthe contemporary world. That has made our country \r\nimmune to the sectarian tensions and conflicts \r\nwitnessed in many other countries of the region, \r\nnotwithstanding the acts of violence perpetrated by \r\nsome extremist and terrorist groups targeting security \r\nofficers, residents and expatriates in their quest to \r\nspread terror and discord and to sabotage the national \r\neconomy and development efforts. Such acts are being \r\ndealt with according to the law and justice system in a \r\nmanner that protects the rights of all.\r\nConvinced that Bahraini citizens have a role to play \r\nin building and developing their society, we seek to \r\ncooperate closely with national and international civil \r\nsociety and human rights organizations in an ongoing \r\ndialogue based on an exchange of experiences and \r\nopinions and in a spirit of cooperation, not confrontation. \r\nWe are all parties to the same cause in which we all \r\nbelieve — support and respect for and protection of \r\nhuman rights. In that context, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nhas achieved concrete results in the field of enhancing \r\nhuman rights, notably through the establishment of \r\na commission for prisoners and detainees, a national \r\nfund to compensate those affected by events, and a \r\ngeneral secretariat for grievances within the Ministry \r\nof Interior.\r\nIn that spirit, a historic initiative proposed the \r\ncreation of an Arab human rights court that was \r\nendorsed at the meeting of the League of Arab States \r\nheld in Qatar in March in response to the aspirations of \r\n13-48917 9/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nintervention or the responsibility to protect. When \r\nsuch aggressive policies do not prove beneficial for \r\nthe countries subjected, including my own country, \r\nSyria, those well-known States reveal their true beliefs \r\nand threaten blatant military aggression outside the \r\nmandates of the Security Council and certainly well \r\nbeyond any international consensus.\r\nThose same countries impose immoral, illegal \r\nand unilaterally coercive economic measures. In \r\naddition, they maintain paranoid policies aimed at \r\nspreading sedition and turmoil within pluralistic, \r\nharmonious national communities that had previously \r\nlived for hundreds of years in harmony, unity and \r\nunderstanding. Worst of all, those countries have \r\nlaunched major, destructive wars under the pretext of \r\ncombating terrorism, even as they support terrorism \r\nin my country, in contravention of all United Nations \r\nresolutions and all human and moral values.\r\nI ask the same question I posed last year: Is the \r\ninternational consensus on combating terrorism a \r\nserious commitment undertaken by States Member of \r\nthe Organization, or is it mere rhetoric, written down \r\nbut not put into effect by certain countries?\r\nWhat is happening in my country has become clear \r\nto everyone. Yet some countries do not want to recognize \r\nthat Al-Qaida, the most dangerous terrorist organization \r\nin the world, and its many offshoots — including Jabhat \r\nAl-Nusra, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, \r\nthe Islamic Brigade and many others — are fighting \r\nin Syria. While scenes of murder, manslaughter and \r\neven the eating of human hearts were seen on television \r\nscreens worldwide, that did not affect the conscience of \r\nthose who chose to turn a blind eye. In my country, the \r\nheads of innocent civilians have been grilled because \r\nthey violated some extremist ideology and held views \r\nthat deviate from those of Al-Qaida. In my country, \r\nmurderers have dismembered human bodies while \r\nthe victims were still alive and sent their limbs to \r\ntheir families because those citizens were defending a \r\nunified and secular Syria.\r\nIn Syria — as in those countries that daily violate \r\nbasic human rights to life, livelihood and their own \r\nreligious beliefs and political affiliations — any Syrian \r\ncitizen who does not belong to that obscurantist takfiri \r\nideology is doomed to be killed or maimed or to \r\nwitness female relatives taken as captives on the basis \r\nof perverted concepts of religion that have nothing to \r\ndo with Islam.\r\nout of a sense of international responsibility and in \r\nall honesty and sincerity, wishes to play an active role \r\nin promoting international cooperation and strategic \r\npartnerships with the international community. Bahrain \r\nlooks forward to a better and brighter tomorrow in \r\nwhich individual dignity and fundamental freedoms are \r\na reality, and an individual’s just and legitimate rights \r\nare protected. Bahrain rejects conflicts and wars and \r\nseeks to maintain friendly relations with all countries of \r\nthe world within the framework of respect for national \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, as \r\nstipulated by the principles and purposes of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Walid Al-Moualem, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nExpatriates of the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to congratulate Mr. Ashe, the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, and his friendly \r\ncountry, Antigua and Barbuda, on his election as \r\nPresident at the sixty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly. I wish him every success in conducting our \r\nwork through his major and neutral role as President of \r\nthe Assembly, like that of his predecessor, who avoided \r\nengaging the presidency in special political agendas.\r\nLast year when I addressed the Assembly (see \r\nA/67/PV.19), we were compelled to address many \r\nevents that had ravaged our country and our world. We \r\nwere full of hope that the scene would change for the \r\nbetter this year. Unfortunately, the situation remains \r\nthe same, and in some parts of the world has even \r\ndeteriorated. Many countries continue to face political, \r\neconomic and financial crises that exceed their ability \r\nto tackle them on their own. While the international \r\ncommunity looked forward to effective international \r\nefforts to overcome those crises, today we bear witness \r\nto exacerbated and intensified problems.\r\nThat exacerbation is due to the hegemony and \r\ndominion that thwart peoples’ capabilities. Such \r\ndomination has escalated in a way that blatantly \r\ncontradicts the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the norms of international law. Instead of \r\nsettling regional and international conflicts by peaceful \r\nmeans, some well-known countries continue to pursue \r\naggressive policies against certain nations. Political \r\nhypocrisy allows them to intervene in the domestic \r\naffairs of States under the pretext of humanitarian \r\n10/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nAssembly of Syria’s commitment to fully implementing \r\nthe provisions of the Convention and to cooperating \r\nwith the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical \r\nWeapons as a State party to the Convention.\r\nOne challenge that we all still face is not knowing \r\nwhether those who are supplying terrorists with such \r\nweapons will abide by their legal commitments, since \r\nthe terrorists who used poisonous gas in my country \r\nreceived chemical agents from countries of the region \r\nand the West that are well known to all of us. They \r\nare the ones using poisonous gas on our military and \r\ninnocent civilians alike.\r\nEnding aggressive policies towards Syria is the first \r\nappropriate step on the road to a solution in my country. \r\nIn the light of the continuing support being given to \r\nterrorism, whether in the form of arms, funding or \r\ntraining, any political solution will be misleading and a \r\nmere illusion. Syria has repeatedly stated that it is open \r\nto a political solution to its crisis. It is now up to those \r\nwho claim to support a political solution for Syria to \r\nhalt all practices and policies hostile to Syria and head \r\nto Geneva without preconditions.\r\nOn the basis of their national right to self-\r\ndetermination, the Syrian people have the \r\nexclusive authority to choose their leadership, their \r\nrepresentatives, their future and a political system \r\nthat will accommodate every sector of Syrian society, \r\nincluding those who have been deceived and beguiled \r\nonto the wrong path. We in Syria place no bets on any \r\nparty but the Syrian people, all of whom are determined \r\nto reject all foreign interference in their domestic affairs \r\nand to defeat the advocates of sectarianism, extremism \r\nand terrorism. In my country, State policies are firmly \r\ntied to the aspirations of the people. Ballot boxes for \r\nfree and fair elections remain the only way for the \r\nSyrian people to determine their own future, free from \r\nthe pressures of terrorism and foreign control.\r\nThere remain those who do not want a political \r\nsolution and always resort to aggression, either directly \r\nor through their agents on the ground. That is what is \r\nhappening in Syria. As I mentioned, Syria is committed \r\nto a political solution, but that does not mean allowing \r\nterrorists to attack innocent civilians. It does not mean \r\nwatching our mosques and churches be destroyed, as \r\nhas happened in Homs and Aleppo and is happening \r\nnow in the town of Malula, the only place in the world \r\nwhose people still speak the language of Jesus Christ. \r\nWhat is happening to the churches and mosques is also \r\nThere is no civil war in Syria. It is a war against \r\nterror, which does not recognize values, justice or \r\nequality and disregards all human rights and laws. \r\nTherefore, confronting terrorism in my country requires \r\nthe international community to act in accordance \r\nwith the relevant resolutions on counter-terrorism, \r\nparticularly Security Council resolution 1373 (2001). \r\nIt must take all necessary and immediate measures to \r\ncompel those countries that are known to finance, arm, \r\ntrain and provide safe haven and passage to terrorists \r\nfrom different countries to stop doing so.\r\nThe city of New York and its people have witnessed \r\nthe devastations of terrorism. They were burned by the \r\nfires of extremists and suffered bloodshed, just as we \r\nare suffering now in Syria. How can countries hit by \r\nthe same terrorism that we now suffer in Syria claim \r\nto be fighting terrorism throughout the world while \r\nsupporting it in my country? Claims of the existence \r\nof moderate militants and extremist militants have \r\nbecome a bad and senseless joke. Terrorism means only \r\nterrorism. It cannot be classified as moderate terrorism \r\nand extremist terrorism. What should we call those \r\nwho kidnap children in order to sell their body organs \r\noutside the country? How should we describe those \r\nwho recruit children and prevent them from going to \r\nschool and instead train them to shoot and kill? How \r\nwould one describe those who spread perverted fatwas \r\nconcerning sexual or incest-related jihad?\r\nWe were the ones targeted by poisonous gases in \r\nKhan al-Assal. We asked for an investigative mission \r\nand demanded that its mandate include the ability to \r\ndetermine who had used chemical weapons. However, \r\nthe United States of America and its friends the United \r\nKingdom and France prevented that and insisted that \r\nthe mission be limited to deciding whether or not \r\nchemical weapons had been used. In Syria, we waited \r\nfive months for the mission to come. When it arrived, \r\nit was withdrawn before the completion of its task \r\nas certain States had begun to beat the drums of war \r\nagainst Syria.\r\nMy country has accepted the praiseworthy \r\ninitiative launched by Mr. Vladimir Putin, President of \r\nthe Russian Federation. By acceding to the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention, Syria has proved its commitment \r\nagainst the use of such weapons. Syria also calls on the \r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibility \r\nagainst the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East. Syria is known for fulfilling its \r\nobligations and commitments. Therefore, I assure the \r\n13-48917 11/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nSyria also reaffirms its support for the legitimate and \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people, particularly \r\ntheir rights of return and of self-determination, and \r\nto establish an independent State on their land, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nNow that Syria has acceded to the Convention \r\non the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \r\nStockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on \r\nTheir Destruction, my country renews its call on the \r\ninternational community to work to establish a zone \r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle \r\nEast. In that regard, we would remind the international \r\ncommunity of Syria’s initiative, taken at the end of its \r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council in \r\n2003, and call on the Security Council to adopt it.\r\nSyria stresses that establishing a zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East will \r\nbe unachievable without the accession of Israel, \r\nthe only nuclear Power in the region, to all treaties \r\nbanning such weapons, and without its agreement to \r\nput its nuclear facilities under the supervision of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. At the same time, \r\nwe emphasize the right of all countries to acquire and \r\ndevelop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, in \r\naccordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. In that regard, Syria condemns \r\nthe fact that the United States and Israel continue to \r\nblock the holding of the international conference on \r\nestablishing a zone free of weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East that was scheduled to take place in \r\n2012.\r\nMy country calls on the United States, the countries \r\nof the European Union and others to refrain from taking \r\nimmoral unilateral economic measures that contravene \r\nthe rules of international law and the principles of free \r\ntrade. We therefore call for the lifting of the blockade \r\nthat has been imposed by the United States on Cuba for \r\ndecades. We also renew our call for lifting and ending \r\nall unilateral coercive measures imposed on Syria and \r\nthe peoples of countries such as Venezuela, Belarus, \r\nIran and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nWe hope that the United Nations will lead the \r\npeoples of the world towards a better future, so that \r\nthey may achieve their aspirations for prosperity, \r\ndevelopment and food self-sufficiency, free from all \r\nforms of tension, confrontation and war, thus fulfilling \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which upholds the sovereignty and equality \r\naffecting the entire historical and cultural heritage of \r\nSyria and humankind.\r\nDo those representing the Member States in \r\nthe Assembly know that terrorists from more than \r\n83 countries are engaged in killing our people and our \r\narmy in the name of global takfiri jihad? Furthermore, \r\nare some Member States entitled to demand that the \r\nSyrian State ignore its constitutional responsibilities to \r\nprotect its citizens and preserve its unity, sovereignty \r\nand independence? The war on terror is not only Syria’s \r\nwar. One day, those terrorists will return to their \r\ncountries, and then no country in the world will be \r\nsafe from that terrorism that recognizes no borders or \r\ngeography.\r\nThe events in Syria have created humanitarian \r\nneeds that continue to grow in several key sectors. The \r\nimmoral, inhumane and unilateral sanctions imposed \r\nby the United States and the European Union have \r\nworsened Syrian citizens’ living conditions at a time \r\nwhen my Government is working with the United \r\nNations and international organizations within the \r\nframework of a response plan to meet the basic needs \r\nof citizens, particularly those who have been forced \r\nto leave their homes. It should be noted that many of \r\nour people have been forced to f lee to neighbouring \r\ncountries in great numbers owing to the activities of \r\narmed terrorist groups in border areas. Regrettably, in \r\nsome of those countries displaced Syrians have been \r\nput in military training camps and places resembling \r\ndetention centres.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I appeal to Syrian citizens to \r\nreturn to their towns and villages, where the State will \r\nguarantee their safe return and dignified livelihood, \r\nfar from the inhumane conditions in such camps. I \r\nassure the Assembly of our readiness to make every \r\neffort to deliver aid from international organizations \r\nto all Syrian citizens without discrimination, wherever \r\nthey are, in compliance with resolution 46/182, while \r\nrespecting Syria’s sovereignty and independence.\r\nThe developments in my country should not make \r\nus lose sight of Palestine and the Syrian Golan. The \r\nSyrian Arab Republic affirms its natural right to full \r\nsovereignty over the occupied Syrian Golan up to \r\nthe line of 4 June 1967, and emphasizes its rejection \r\nof all measures taken by Israel, the occupying Power, \r\nto change its natural demographic and geographic \r\nfeatures in clear violation of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, particularly resolution 497 (1981). \r\n12/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nAt the sixty-sixth session of the General Assembly, \r\nTurkmenistan’s President launched an initiative aimed \r\nat the adoption of a United Nations declaration on \r\nprioritizing political and diplomatic ways and means \r\nfor the resolution of international challenges. Today, \r\nthe elaboration of such a document has become a top \r\npriority. Turkmenistan therefore reaffirms its firm \r\ndesire to engage in a meaningful discussion on this \r\ninitiative with all interested Member States. We are \r\nconvinced that the adoption of such a declaration would \r\nhelp to expand and strengthen the legal basis for the \r\nwork of the General Assembly, the Security Council \r\nand other United Nations entities dealing with issues \r\nrelating to world peace, stability and security.\r\nThe challenging processes unfolding in today’s \r\nworld call for a responsible, thoughtful, effective \r\nand efficient approach on the part of the United \r\nNations. That is also linked directly to the important \r\nchallenges of disarmament. By playing an active role \r\nin the multilateral dialogue on disarmament issues, my \r\nGovernment is demonstrating its firm commitment to \r\ncomplying with the core international norms regulating \r\nthe disarmament process and the non-proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction through practical \r\naction. Following this course of action and taking \r\ninto consideration the need to energize the discussion \r\nand meaningful consideration of disarmament issues, \r\nTurkmenistan proposes the convening in 2014 of a high-\r\nlevel international meeting on disarmament issues. \r\nWe are prepared to create all the necessary conditions \r\nand to provide the appropriate infrastructure for this \r\nmeeting in our capital city.\r\nNowadays, problems related to strengthening \r\npeace and stability and to ensuring the stability of \r\ncountries and nations are among the most important \r\ntopics in global politics. Their resolution will depend \r\nprimarily on the establishment and effective legal \r\nand organizational operationalization of international \r\npolitical cooperation. In this context, we advise the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this session to embark on the \r\nconsideration of issues relating to the improvement of \r\nvarious forms of multilateral interaction that could serve \r\nas a political platform for finding mutually acceptable \r\ndecisions on urgent regional and international policy \r\nmatters.\r\nIt should be noted in that regard that the \r\nUnited Nations fulfils its purpose. For example, the \r\nestablishment of United Nations preventive diplomacy \r\ncentres in various regions of the world has become a \r\nof all the rights and duties of all Member States. In \r\nthat regard, my country welcomes the efforts of the \r\nUnited States and Iran to bridge the gap of mistrust \r\nbetween the two countries, and hopes that this will be \r\nreflected constructively and positively in the stability \r\nof international relations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Rashid Meredov, Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet \r\nof Ministers and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nTurkmenistan.\r\nMr. Meredov (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nAt the outset, allow me to express our sincere gratitude \r\nfor the honour of addressing the General Assembly from \r\nthis rostrum. I bring greetings from His Excellency \r\nMr. Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, President of \r\nTurkmenistan, who wishes the General Assembly the \r\nbest of luck at this session. I congratulate Mr. John \r\nWilliam Ashe on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session and wish him all \r\nthe best in fulfilling his forthcoming tasks. I would also \r\nlike to thank Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his skill and \r\neffectiveness in that post.\r\nTurkmenistan considers this session to be an \r\nimportant phase in the process of consolidating the \r\nefforts of the international community to strengthen \r\nuniversal peace, stability and security by adopting \r\nmeaningful decisions on sustainable development and \r\nto counter emerging challenges and threats. We believe \r\nthat strict adherence to the principles and norms of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations is the main prerequisite \r\nfor ensuring long-term peace and strategic stability.\r\nIn that belief, Turkmenistan adheres to a steady \r\nand resolute policy of peace, good-neighbourliness and \r\nthe active promotion of peacebuilding processes. As a \r\nmatter of principle, we reject the use of military force as \r\na tool of foreign policy and international relations. Our \r\ncountry is convinced that solutions based on the use \r\nof force are doomed to fail. They neither eliminate the \r\ncauses of conflicts nor create conditions for adequate \r\nresponses to the many issues that arise from military \r\naction. Therefore, at the heart of Turkmenistan’s policies \r\nis the will to resolve any situation by peaceful, political \r\nand diplomatic ways and means, which it considers to \r\nbe the main legitimate resources available within the \r\nUnited Nations. This approach is based on our common \r\ngoal to establish a world without conflict.\r\n13-48917 13/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nof the aforementioned document; and an international \r\ndatabase designed for the collection and analysis of \r\ndata on the implementation of international obligations \r\nassumed by the participating States.\r\nIt is common knowledge that on 17 May 2013 the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted by consensus resolution \r\n67/263, submitted on the initiative of Turkmenistan’s \r\nPresident, entitled “Reliable and stable transit of energy \r\nand its role in ensuring sustainable development and \r\ninternational cooperation”. The importance of that \r\ndocument lies primarily in the fact that it forms the \r\nbasis for a global energy partnership that takes into \r\naccount the interests of producer States, transit States \r\nand States that are consumers of energy resources.\r\nIn accordance with the letter and the spirit of that \r\nresolution, our country proposes to Member States \r\nthe establishment, during the current session of the \r\nAssembly, of an international group of experts for the \r\ndevelopment of a new mechanism for energy security. \r\nTo that end, the Government of Turkmenistan proposes \r\nto convene an international meeting of experts on \r\nthat topic in 2014. We are ready to engage in close \r\ncooperation with all Member States and the United \r\nNations Secretariat with a view to organizing and \r\nholding such a forum.\r\nCurrently the resolution of issues of security and \r\nsustainable development depends largely on the level \r\nof international cooperation in the important areas of \r\ntransport and communications. The geo-economic \r\npotential of new transport and transit routes in the \r\nworld is enormously significant. Such routes involve \r\nvast spaces and enormous human resources and \r\nattract considerable investments. All of that creates \r\nopportunities to transform the transport sector into \r\none of the most important factors in sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nTurkmenistan is convinced that the twenty-first-\r\ncentury transportation architecture provides the \r\nframework for a breakthrough in integration, in joining \r\nthe common efforts of regions and in the pooling of \r\nresources and industrial and human potential. It is \r\nour firm conviction that the future belongs to such \r\na combined system of transport communication, \r\ninvolving major international and regional maritime, \r\nroad, railroad and air hubs, their optimal integration \r\nand the use of their specific advantages.\r\nThe practical implementation of that idea \r\nbecame the subject of a high-level event on modality, \r\nhighly effective form of joint work to strengthen security, \r\nprevent conflicts and eliminate their underlying causes. \r\nIt is well known that the first such centre, the United \r\nNations Regional Centre for Preventive Diplomacy in \r\nCentral Asia, based in Ashgabat, opened in December \r\n2007. In our view, the experience of creating new \r\nmechanisms and institutions aimed at forming a system \r\nof international interaction at the global and regional \r\nlevels must and should be replicated by States Members \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nTaking into account the need to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of inter-State contact at the regional \r\nlevel, Turkmenistan has launched a forum of peace \r\nand cooperation, aimed at establishing a standing \r\nmechanism for political dialogue in Central Asia. \r\nWe believe that the forum will contribute to the \r\nelaboration of consensus-based approaches to finding \r\nsolutions to the most important issues relating to the \r\npresent and future development of Central Asia and \r\nits neighbouring regions. Moreover, the forum could \r\nbecome the basis for the establishment of a consultative \r\ncouncil of the Heads of State of Central Asia. We are \r\nconvinced that the development of new formats for \r\npolitical interaction among States within the region, \r\ncoupled with the effective functioning of United \r\nNations regional structures, will provide a reliable \r\nfoundation and stability for the entire architecture of \r\ninter-State relations in Central Asia.\r\nTo a great extent, attaining the goals of \r\ncomprehensive and universal security will depend on \r\nensuring security in the sphere of energy. Furthermore, \r\nthe achievement of that goal is one of the most \r\nimportant components of a stable world economy and \r\nserves to protect it against distortions and disruptions. \r\nIn that connection, the development of an international \r\nmechanism that provides for a set of guarantees for the \r\nglobal energy supply is a task of paramount importance. \r\nIt is also necessary to underscore the importance of \r\nthe joint work and coordinated efforts of all Member \r\nStates aimed at developing and adopting consolidated \r\napproaches to the solution of energy security issues.\r\nThe establishment by the United Nations of a new \r\nuniversal international legal tool kit is a key element \r\nof that process. It should, in our view, consist of the \r\nfollowing three major elements: a multilateral United \r\nNations document providing the legal basis for \r\nrelations in the area of the global supply of energy \r\nresources; a corresponding United Nations structure \r\nthat would ensure the implementation of the provisions \r\n14/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nrole of multilateral international mechanisms aimed at \r\npreventing the negative consequences of global climate \r\nchange. In particular, we refer to the need for enhancing \r\nthe implementation of the provisions of the United \r\nNations Convention to Combat Desertification. In that \r\nconnection, we are prepared to host in Turkmenistan \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification in 2014.\r\nFurthermore, our country would like to launch an \r\ninitiative aimed at the establishment of a specialized \r\nentity, a subregional centre on technologies relating \r\nto climate change in Central Asia and the Caspian Sea \r\nbasin. We believe that such an entity would help the \r\ncountries of our regions to substantially strengthen \r\ntheir interaction in the sphere of environmental security \r\nand would contribute to the effective coordination of \r\ninterregional efforts in that field.\r\nThe challenges confronting the community \r\nof nations in the area of security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment cannot be resolved unless we find a \r\nsolution to the humanitarian issues at the international \r\nlevel. In particular, we are referring to the serious global \r\nproblem of the fate of refugees and stateless persons. \r\nAs a permanent member of the Executive Committee of \r\nthe High Commissioner’s Programme of the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\nTurkmenistan has accumulated valuable experience in \r\nresolving the issues facing people who were forced to \r\nleave their home countries. Together with the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\nwe propose that all interested parties become familiar \r\nwith Turkmenistan’s practical work in granting \r\ncitizenship to refugees and stateless persons.\r\nIn that connection, it would be advisable to work \r\njointly with United Nations humanitarian agencies to \r\ndevelop an appropriate social programme. Moreover, \r\ntaking into account the outcomes of the International \r\nMinisterial Conference of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation on Refugees in the Muslim World, held \r\nin Ashgabat in May 2012, we consider it necessary to \r\ndevelop long-term solutions to such issues, on the basis \r\nof generally recognized norms of international law. \r\nWith a view to discussing those issues, we are ready \r\nto host in Turkmenistan in 2014 a high-level event in \r\ncooperation with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees.\r\nToday, as Member States actively discuss the \r\nrole and place of the United Nations in international \r\ninterconnectivity and the post-2015 development \r\nprogramme, which was held in New York on \r\n26 September. It was organized by the Government of \r\nTurkmenistan and the International Road Transport \r\nUnion. The event focused on the search for effective \r\nsolutions relating to the establishment of modern, \r\ndiversified and safe transport infrastructure throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nWe consider it necessary to continue the multilateral \r\ndialogue on transport issues that was initiated during \r\nthe current session of the General Assembly. In that \r\nconnection, Turkmenistan would like to submit a \r\nproposal to host in 2014 in Ashgabat an international \r\nconference on the role of transport and transit corridors \r\nin ensuring international cooperation, stability and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nWith regard to the achievement of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, we believe that the greatest attention \r\nshould be focused on promoting the economic interests \r\nof States, while maintaining an appropriate ecological \r\nbalance and preventing harm to the environment. That, \r\nin turn, implies the use of cutting-edge environmental \r\ntechnologies and the development of innovative \r\nsolutions for the preservation of nature. Preserving \r\nthe significant environmental component of the global \r\neconomic space has therefore become an integral part \r\nof its effectiveness.\r\nWe highly value the efforts undertaken by the \r\nSecretary-General, as well as the successive actions \r\nof the international community at the United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conferences in Copenhagen and \r\nCancun and during the seventeenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, held in Durban, which have \r\ngradually laid the foundations for the development \r\nof comprehensive decisions at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development.\r\nWe look forward to the continuation of a constructive \r\ninternational dialogue on that topic during the sixty-\r\neighth session of the Assembly. We are convinced that \r\nit is necessary to combine our efforts in that area at \r\nthe international, regional and national levels, and to \r\neffectively coordinate the efforts of States with those of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nTaking into account the numerous aspects of the \r\nclimate change issue, Turkmenistan wishes to state at the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly that it stands \r\nready to make its contribution to the strengthening of the \r\n13-48917 15/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nhave contributed positively to increased security and \r\nstability in the world. However, the rapid developments \r\nwitnessed today, including steady population growth, \r\nrising global demand for energy and natural resources \r\nand tremendous advances in communications and \r\nnew technologies, have given rise to numerous \r\ndifficulties. Joint efforts and greater cooperation \r\namong Governments are required to address them and \r\nfind appropriate solutions. Such action requires that the \r\nOrganization and its various organs be empowered to \r\nstrengthen their capacity to respond to global demands \r\nand developments, with a sharp focus on vital and \r\nurgent issues.\r\nModernization, development and change constitute \r\nthe norms of life. However, they must go hand in hand \r\nwith increased security and stability, which should be \r\nbased on cooperation among all nations and should be \r\naimed at achieving sustainable development goals.\r\nThe recent events in various countries in the \r\nMiddle East resulted from genuine reactions to the \r\nsocioeconomic hardships faced by the peoples of the \r\nregion and to diminished institutional capacities to \r\nrespond fully to their needs and demands. Despite the \r\nloss of lives and property in those countries, current \r\nefforts are aimed at stability and restoring the economy, \r\nand as such deserve our support.\r\nMy country welcomes the consensus achieved in \r\nthe Security Council on the issue of chemical weapons \r\nin Syria and the unanimous adoption of resolution \r\n2118 (2013). The “Geneva II” conference is of critical \r\nimportance in facilitating negotiations between the \r\nSyrian Government and the opposition forces. We \r\nbelieve that the goal should be a ceasefire and the \r\nformation of a transitional authority with the necessary \r\npower to overcome the enormous difficulties resulting \r\nfrom a war that has been ongoing for approximately \r\nthree years.\r\nThe international community should prepare \r\nto provide support and humanitarian assistance to \r\ndisplaced Syrians and to all those affected by that \r\nabhorrent war. My country confirms its continued \r\nassistance to aid the displaced Syrians and expresses its \r\nreadiness to contribute to international humanitarian \r\naid inside Syrian territory.\r\nWe welcome the positive developments taking \r\nplace in Somalia thanks to the efforts of President \r\nHassan Sheikh Mohamud to rebuild the Somali State. \r\nIt is our hope that our brothers in the Federal Republic \r\nrelations, Turkmenistan declares that constructive and \r\nmultilateral cooperation with the United Nations is \r\nthe top priority of its foreign policy strategy. In that \r\nconnection, we believe that it is precisely the United \r\nNations that is the main and universal international \r\nOrganization, which adopts decisions concerning \r\nthe most important issues of global development and \r\ncomprehensive peace and security. Since its inception, \r\nthe United Nations has demonstrated its role as the \r\nfoundation of the entire system of international stability, \r\nthrough mechanisms to ensure justice and to resolve \r\nthe most complex international problems.\r\nSimilarly, we share the opinion of the Organization \r\ntoday that the issue of providing it with fresh impetus \r\nis increasingly relevant, in view of the rapidly changing \r\nrealities of the modern world. Therefore, Turkmenistan \r\nsupports a strengthened and expanded role for the \r\nUnited Nations at the global level.\r\nWe are firmly convinced that international \r\nlaw and the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations — based on peace, equal rights and respect for \r\nnations, their rights and sovereignty — must remain \r\nthe foundation of the world order in the twenty-first \r\ncentury.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla, Minister of \r\nState for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): It gives \r\nme great pleasure, at the outset, to extend my warmest \r\ncongratulations to the President and his friendly \r\ncountry, Antigua and Barbuda, on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. We wish him every success in his endeavour \r\nand assure him that the Sultanate of Oman stands ready \r\nto cooperate with him and all delegations and Member \r\nStates to achieve the desired objectives.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nour thanks and appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić, of the friendly Republic of Serbia, for the \r\noutstanding manner in which he conducted the work \r\nof the previous session, as well as to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts to enhance the \r\nrole of the Organization and develop its operational \r\nmechanisms to respond to current challenges and recent \r\ndevelopments and ensure optimal future preparedness.\r\nThe numerous achievements and successes of \r\nthe United Nations since its establishment, in 1945, \r\n16/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nReview Conference, owing to the fact that some \r\nparties did not support its convening. That reflects a \r\nlack of understanding of the conditions, objectives and \r\naspirations of the peoples of the Middle East region.\r\nIn the light of our commitment to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, we would like to \r\nannounce that we have attained the Goals and all their \r\nindicators. In fact, we recently announced that we had \r\nbeen 100 per cent successful in achieving Goals 4 and \r\n5.\r\nWith regard to protection of the environment and \r\nnatural conservation, since the dawn of the renaissance \r\nled by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, my \r\ncountry, in line with the national strategy to protect the \r\nenvironment, has consistently integrated environmental \r\nissues into its plans and development goals, with a view \r\nto achieving a balance between the aims of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the preservation of the environment.\r\nMy country has also sought to share its interests \r\nin the environment and natural conservation with \r\nthe international community. We have participated \r\nin many regional and international conferences on \r\nthe environment, including the eighteenth session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, held \r\nin Qatar in December 2012. We look forward to \r\nparticipating in the nineteenth session, to be held in \r\nWarsaw in November.\r\nThe right to science and knowledge should be \r\nenjoyed by all humankind, and the great evolution \r\nin the use and application of modern technology has \r\nbecome an essential tool in our daily lives, thanks to \r\nscientific and intellectual creativity. Consequently, my \r\ncountry has sought to keep up with advances to meet \r\nour current needs. To that end, we have established \r\nmany centres and councils that encourage research \r\nand development, including the Scientific Research \r\nCouncil, the Industrial Innovation Centre, the National \r\nCentre for Enterprises and Commercial Activities, and \r\nthe Oasis of Knowledge. We also have a Middle East \r\nDesalination Research Centre.\r\nMy country continues to develop the main \r\nguidelines for a national strategy of research and \r\ndevelopment and scientific knowledge. We are also \r\ntrying to familiarize ourselves with modern technology \r\nand to encourage Omani youth to take part in different \r\nscience — and technology-based professions. In that \r\ncontext, we welcome future constructive cooperation, \r\nof Somalia will be able to implement the political \r\nand economic reform programme that has gained the \r\nsupport of the international community.\r\nAmong the important international issues that have \r\nyet to be resolved is the Palestinian question, which \r\nis considered the cornerstone of any possible peace \r\nin the Middle East. Despite the efforts made and the \r\nagreements concluded through direct negotiations \r\nbetween successive Israeli Governments and the \r\nPalestine Liberation Organization, no settlement has yet \r\nbeen reached. In that regard, my country supports the \r\nefforts of President Barack Obama and his Secretary of \r\nState, Mr. John Kerry, as they represent an opportunity \r\nfor all the peoples of the region to establish peace. \r\nThat would lead to economic and social development \r\nand revive the hope for peaceful coexistence among \r\nthe peoples of the region — all of which would ensure \r\na positive contribution by the Middle East to global \r\ncivilization.\r\nMy country continues to support the initiatives \r\naimed at transforming the Middle East into a zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, as it is fully aware of the effects of those \r\nweapons on the security and stability of States, regions \r\nand the entire world.\r\nWith our emphasis on the right of States to \r\nbenefit from the peaceful use of nuclear energy, it is \r\nworth mentioning that the current dispute will not be \r\nresolved through coercive policies and practices, such \r\nas sanctions and other tough measures. Because those \r\nmeasures are limited, their effectiveness is weakened. \r\nRather, creative diplomacy can help all States to benefit \r\nfrom nuclear power for peaceful purposes.\r\nOn the other hand, we hope that the international \r\ncommunity, particularly the depositary countries of \r\nthe NPT, will be able to persuade other Middle Eastern \r\nStates to become parties to the Treaty and to subject \r\ntheir nuclear facilities to the comprehensive system \r\nof safeguards that exists under the supervision of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency. That would \r\ncontribute to achieving the universality of the Treaty \r\nand would make the Middle East a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That \r\ngoal deserves the support of all countries, especially \r\nthe major Powers.\r\nWe express our regret at the non-convening of the \r\ninternational conference on the Middle East mandated \r\nby the decision of the 2010 Non-Proliferation Treaty \r\n13-48917 17/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nSome of the greatest achievements of the United \r\nNations are in the field of international law. Within these \r\nwalls, the history of international relations continues to \r\nbe written and brave new steps to be taken. The latest \r\naccomplishment is the adoption of the Arms Trade \r\nTreaty. Iceland is proud to have been the first State to \r\nratify this landmark treaty. We call on all States — in \r\nparticular arms exporters — to do so as well, so that it \r\nenters into force without delay.\r\nIn the year 2000, world leaders gathered in this city \r\nand made a historic decision by adopting the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. Since then, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals have served us well. For almost 15 years, they \r\nhave influenced and guided the development priorities \r\nof nations and organizations. They have increased \r\nawareness of heartbreaking poverty and inspired new \r\npolicymaking. The Millennium Development Goals \r\nare indeed central to Iceland’s development policy, and \r\nmy Government is firmly committed to shouldering \r\nour responsibility in a globalized world. As new goals \r\nare defined, the focus should remain on eliminating \r\npoverty, achieving gender equality, improving health \r\nand providing education for girls and boys.\r\nThe pressure on our ecosystem calls for urgent \r\naction to combat pollution and land degradation, as \r\nwell as a balanced consideration of conservation and \r\nthe utilization of natural resources. It is a challenge to \r\nensure food security when land and water resources are \r\nthreatened. Our duty is to share experiences and know-\r\nhow to restore land and improve land management — to \r\nchange deserts into blooming fields.\r\nFurthermore, climate change and disasters such as \r\nthe one in Fukushima have taught us that a real energy \r\ntransformation is needed. Safe, clean and renewable \r\nenergy is the way of the future. Iceland has undergone \r\na true energy revolution. Today, almost all of our \r\nelectricity and heating needs are met with renewable \r\nenergy. That success story is a source of a productive \r\npartnership between Iceland and the United Nations, \r\nand now also the World Bank.\r\nOur world is wealthy. That wealth is not only \r\npreserved in the minerals of the Earth, the power of the \r\nrivers and the rich living marine resources. Our greatest \r\nwealth is people — the knowledge, the experiences, the \r\nconstant journey of the human mind to explore and \r\ninvent new solutions.\r\nIceland makes use of those assets in its development \r\ncooperation. We are proud to offer the world our \r\ninvestment and partnerships with all other centres, \r\nuniversities, institutions and specialized industries \r\nin both the public and the private sectors and at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. We also want \r\nto take advantage of Oman’s geographical position as a \r\nmain gateway and bridge to knowledge and creativity \r\nin regional and international markets.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish the President every success \r\nat this session, and we hope that it concludes with a \r\nrealistic and renewed vision — an inspired vision and \r\none that also imparts new momentum for our times, a \r\nvision that reflects the aspirations of every generation \r\nand every people and makes every effort to achieve \r\nthem.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Iceland.\r\nMr. Sveinsson (Iceland): Once again, we have \r\nwitnessed outrageous acts of terrorism against innocent \r\npeople, most recently in Kenya, Iraq and Pakistan. \r\nOur thoughts go out to the victims and their families. \r\nIt is the primary responsibility of all Governments \r\nto protect their citizens. A few weeks ago, the world \r\nwitnessed the use of chemical weapons in Syria. It \r\nis hard to find words strong enough to express our \r\ncondemnation. International law has been violated, war \r\ncrimes committed and globally shared values have been \r\nshattered. Those responsible must be held accountable \r\nand should answer to the International Criminal Court.\r\nThe devastation inflicted on the Syrian people \r\nmust end. A country is in ruins. Innocent lives are lost \r\nevery day, more than 6 million people are displaced \r\nand stability in the region is threatened. The Syrian \r\nGovernment has not lived up to its responsibility \r\ntowards its own citizens. It has retaliated with \r\nunabated violence instead of choosing a path of reform, \r\nreconciliation and improved rights for its people. The \r\ncrisis calls for firm action to be taken by the international \r\ncommunity. Syria must comply with its international \r\nobligations, and all parties to the conflict must respect \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law. We welcome the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 2118 (2013) and \r\ncall on the Council to ensure that Syria fully meets its \r\ncommitments. The Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522, \r\nannex) must also be honoured and a “Geneva II” \r\nconference convened urgently. The tragedy in Syria has \r\nonce again underscored the fundamental importance of \r\ninternational law and order.\r\n18/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nthe past three years. Women assumed their rightful \r\nplace and have called on their leaders to show real \r\nleadership. They call for respect for human rights and \r\nthe equal treatment of women and men. They call for \r\nthe freedom to express their views and to determine \r\ntheir own future through democratic processes.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIt is regrettable that developments in the region have \r\nbeen overshadowed by political discord and continued \r\nviolence. We deplore the loss of lives and condemn all \r\nviolence. We also call on the Governments in the region \r\nto demonstrate their commitment to democracy with \r\nconcrete actions.\r\nThe developments in the Middle East cannot be \r\nseparated from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As \r\nUnited States President Obama said, the Palestinian \r\npeople have a right to live with security and dignity \r\nin their own sovereign State. Israel’s security depends \r\nupon the realization of a Palestinian State, and stability \r\nwill be served only through a two-State solution and \r\na secure Israel. We welcome the renewed peace talks \r\nbetween the State of Israel and the State of Palestine \r\nand applaud United States Secretary Kerry for his \r\ncommitment in that regard. We must respect the right \r\nof the Palestinian people to self-determination as well \r\nas Israel’s right to exist in peace with its neighbours. \r\nBut time is running out.\r\nThe continuing settlement activities, in violation \r\nof international law, threaten to make the two-State \r\nsolution impossible. Therefore, the Government of \r\nIsrael must end all settlements in the West Bank, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem. We denounce the oppressive \r\npolicies of Hamas and condemn the indiscriminate \r\nrocket fire from Gaza. We also call upon Israel to end \r\nthe blockade of the territory.\r\nRespect for international law is fundamental \r\nfor relations between States. If differences arise, we \r\nshould always seek agreements through consultations, \r\nnegotiations or other means for peaceful resolution. \r\nThe principle of the rule of law, which is among the \r\nfounding principles of the United Nations, is vital to us \r\nall — big nations and small.\r\nOne international agreement that Iceland holds in \r\nhigh regard is the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. It was a great achievement when that \r\nimportant Convention was adopted 30 years ago, and \r\nit has proved its relevance by the test of time. The \r\nexpertise where it can make a real difference — for \r\nthe development of geothermal energy, sustainable \r\nfisheries management, the restoration of fertile land \r\nand the promotion of gender equality. More than 2,500 \r\nexperts from all parts of the world have benefited from \r\nthe activities of the four United Nations university \r\ntraining programmes in Iceland since the first one was \r\nestablished 35 years ago. Iceland will focus on those \r\nsame four topics in the post-2015 process. Let me \r\nemphasize that the process must be conducted in a true \r\ndemocratic spirit. It must be inclusive and allow for all \r\nMember States to participate.\r\nAs I glance around the Assembly Hall, I am \r\ninspired by the history and success of the Organization, \r\nwhich represents the immense diversity and talent of \r\nhumankind, and inspired by the potential for future \r\npositive action that the rich fabric of representatives \r\nfrom all Member States represents. But success should \r\nnot blind our vision or cloud our judgement. The f laws \r\nof the Security Council have been sadly exposed in the \r\ncase of Syria. Furthermore, the lack of organizational \r\nreform undermines the credibility of the United Nations.\r\nMuch work remains undone in many areas. As \r\nlong as people are mistreated for their views, race \r\nor religion, or even cast as outlaws for their sexual \r\norientation or gender identity, human rights obligations \r\nare not honoured. We are alarmed that recent legislation \r\nin some countries is violating the fundamental \r\nprinciples of equality and the freedom of expression. \r\nThe responsibility to change that and to ensure the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights rests with us \r\npoliticians. By speaking from this rostrum, each and \r\nevery one of us pledges to uphold those common values \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe promotion of gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women is another urgent task. In \r\n2015, we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the Fourth World Conference on Women, held in \r\nBeijing. We call on all Member States to renew efforts \r\nto implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for \r\nAction. Iceland has been advocating for celebrating the \r\nanniversary through a 12-month campaign, focusing \r\non each of the 12 themes of Beijing. We note that \r\nUN Women is planning its strategy along those lines.\r\nA prominent element in the Beijing Declaration is \r\nthe importance of the active engagement of women for \r\ndemocratic development. The women of the Arab world \r\nhave given that objective a powerful new meaning in \r\n13-48917 19/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney General and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize.\r\nMr. Erlington (Belize): I am once again privileged \r\nto address the General Assembly on behalf of my \r\ncountry, Belize.\r\nIt is with great delight that I congratulate you, \r\nSir, on your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. You are a \r\ntestament to all the peoples of the Caribbean and the \r\nworld of the height to which each of us can aspire \r\nwhen industry and character are fused into one. Rest \r\nassured, Mr. President, of the unqualified support of \r\nBelize throughout your term in office. I also take this \r\nopportunity to thank your predecessor for his service as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\r\nIt is in the quest for the attainment of the two ideals \r\nof peaceful conflict resolution and the enhancement of \r\nthe lives of all peoples that leaders of Member States \r\nmake this annual pilgrimage in September to address \r\nthe General Assembly. Belize commends the United \r\nNations and its visionary leadership over the years for \r\nits unflinching efforts in discharging the core functions \r\nof the Organization.\r\nThe promulgation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, in 2000, resulted in all countries working together, \r\nfor the first time in human history, to address and \r\nrectify the gaps in their development agenda to reduce \r\npoverty. It was a signal event and a major breakthrough \r\nfor the United Nations development agenda. It gave \r\nhope for the provision of huge amounts of desperately \r\nand genuinely needed aid, the transfer of technology \r\nand other development assistance from affluent nations, \r\nfinancial institutions and philanthropists to nations \r\nmired in poverty. That was undoubtedly good news.  It \r\nwas reminiscent of the Marshall Plan, which rescued \r\nGermany and Japan from abject ruin after the Second \r\nWorld War and catapulted them to heights of aff luence \r\nthey had never experienced before.\r\nBy the end of the 1990s, most countries were in \r\ndire straits. According to former Secretary-General \r\nKofi Annan, more than 60 per cent of the world \r\nsubsisted on $2 or less per day, while more than \r\n1 billion people were living on less than $1 per day. \r\nIlliteracy was nearly at 1 billion people. Eight hundred \r\nmillion people were chronically hungry — one in seven \r\npeople on Earth — including 200 million children. And \r\n1.3 billion people lacked even the most basic health-\r\nLaw of the Sea Convention demonstrates how the \r\ninternational order can best work and prescribes how \r\ndifferences should be settled through peaceful means. \r\nThe Convention provides a basis for sound resource \r\nmanagement. However, meeting that objective is \r\ndifficult for many States. The international community \r\nshould do much more to support developing countries \r\nto better conserve and utilize their resources and reform \r\ntheir management policies. As a steadfast advocate \r\nof the Convention, Iceland is firmly committed to its \r\nprovisions. We protest in the strongest terms when \r\nstakeholders resort to threats of coercive measures \r\nwhen differences arise.\r\nIcelanders know better than anyone that the health \r\nof the ocean and its resources must be preserved. It \r\nis fundamental for our existence and livelihood. The \r\nconservation, sound management and sustainable use of \r\nnatural resources are principles that we follow strictly \r\nin our policies. We are sincere and serious in living \r\nup to the responsibility that comes with safeguarding \r\nthe riches of the Earth. For the same reason, the eight \r\nArctic States have developed productive regional \r\ncooperation. As the world witnesses the rapid changes \r\nin the Arctic, we who live in that corner of the world \r\nknow how urgent it is to act and plan for the future. \r\nThe delicate environment must be protected, economic \r\nopportunities developed and the needs of the people \r\nwho live in the Arctic respected.\r\nAs caretakers of the Arctic, we take our global \r\nduty very seriously. It was therefore a great pleasure \r\nand an honour for me to host the Secretary-General in \r\nIceland last summer. During his visit, I demonstrated to \r\nhim how the global impact of climate change melts the \r\nglaciers in the north. Following our trip to the central \r\nhighlands, the Secretary-General observed that we had \r\nnot only seen the ice disappear, we had also heard the \r\nmost powerful sound of ice melting away.\r\nDuring his stay, the Secretary-General gave us \r\nIcelanders an insight into the work of the United \r\nNations — how, every single day, the United Nations \r\nis making a difference in the lives of countless \r\npeople around the world, helping refugees, providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance and saving the lives of \r\nchildren. The United Nations is a force for good in the \r\nworld. Together we can make a real difference; united \r\nwe protect the environment, preserve peace and save \r\nlives. The more united we are, the better the world will \r\nbecome.\r\n20/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nbe devised to ensure that the post-2015 development \r\nagenda does not suffer a similar fate.\r\nAs we embark upon setting the stage for the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, Belize has recognized and \r\nidentified four underpinning points: that the post-\r\n2015 agenda must be global; that it should integrate \r\nthe outcomes of major summits into a cohesive \r\naction-oriented agenda that can be implemented, \r\nbuilding upon successes and improving lessons \r\nlearned; that the necessary resources must be sourced \r\nand committed to underwrite the new partnership for \r\ndevelopment; and that it must be guided by our core \r\nvalues of conflict prevention and poverty eradication.\r\nBelize endorses the intergovernmental processes \r\nfor the elaboration of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Our domestic priorities, which complement the \r\nglobal agenda, are contained in the document Horizon \r\n2030, which articulates our development framework. \r\nSector-specific documents emanating from Horizon \r\n2030 inform our national development agenda in areas \r\nsuch as security, energy, gender, education and health.\r\nTopping the list of our domestic priorities at this \r\ntime is the resolution of the Guatemalan claim, which \r\nposes an existential threat to our nation and requires \r\nurgent resolution if the peoples of our two countries \r\nand our region are to continue to enjoy the peaceful \r\ncoexistence that has characterized our relationship thus \r\nfar. When I addressed the Assembly last September \r\n(see A/67/PV.20), I was pleased to report that our \r\ntwo States had agreed to submit to the citizens of our \r\nrespective countries, in a simultaneous referendum to \r\nbe held on 6 October 2013, six days from today, the \r\nquestion of whether it was the will of our respective \r\nconstituencies that the Guatemalan claim be submitted \r\nto the International Court of Justice for a final \r\nresolution. Regretfully, however, last April, Guatemala \r\ngave official notice to both Belize and the Organization \r\nof American States that the Guatemalan Government \r\nhad decided not to proceed with the referendum and \r\nwas proposing that it be postponed sine die. Not \r\nunexpectedly, that decision was not well received in \r\nBelize.\r\nThe Guatemalan claim is a constant source of \r\nanxiety for our citizens as well as for investors in our \r\ncountry. Furthermore, both our territorial and maritime \r\nborder regions have been suffering from depredations \r\nand environmental degradation as a consequence of the \r\nwanton and sustained illegal activities of Guatemalan \r\ncare, sanitation and education services. Today, 13 years \r\nlater, as the Millennium Development Goals are being \r\nimplemented, the scorecard reveals that, while a small \r\nminority of countries are showing commendable \r\nsuccess in attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, the vast majority of nations are still mired in \r\npoverty, with scant or no signs of development.\r\nWe note with disappointment that rich countries \r\nhave not even been able to bring themselves to honour \r\ntheir commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross domestic product as official domestic assistance \r\nto poor countries. The resources being provided by \r\ninternational and other financial institutions and \r\nby private donors fall far short of what is needed by \r\npoor countries to attain those laudable, and indeed \r\nbasic, Goals. It is evident that, for some inexplicable \r\nreason, developed countries have abandoned Goal \r\n8 — developing a global partnership for development. In \r\nthe absence of the cooperation of developed countries, \r\nthe attainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nby poor countries will remain an illusion.\r\nPoor countries possess neither the requisite \r\nleadership cadres, the financial, human and technical \r\nresources, the infrastructure, the necessary levels of \r\ninvestment and trade nor the institutions to bring about \r\nlevels of development that are capable of generating \r\nthe wealth needed to underwrite the expenses \r\nassociated with the attainment and, most important, \r\nthe sustainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nPerhaps even worse, far too many countries have no \r\nrealistic prospects for achieving such capacity within \r\nthe foreseeable future.  Despite that, Belize remains \r\ncommitted to the attainment of the Goals, which we are \r\npursuing assiduously.\r\nGiven our experience with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, it is, in our view, eminently fitting \r\nthat you, Mr. President, should have kept the spotlight on \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda for the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly.  In that connection, \r\nthe theme “The post-2015 development agenda: \r\nsetting the stage” is very apt indeed. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals must remain a work in progress. The \r\npost-2015 development agenda must be informed by our \r\nexperiences with the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nIn that regard, a careful analysis must be undertaken to \r\nascertain why our rich development partners have failed \r\nto live up to their obligations under the partnership to \r\nprovide the promised development aid and expertise to \r\npoor development partners. And new mechanisms must \r\n13-48917 21/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nshort, conflicts ... are inherent generators of global \r\ninsecurity, the causes of which need to be addressed \r\nby wealthy and poor States alike.”\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the \r\nOrganization of American States and the group of \r\nfriends who support the efforts of Belize and Guatemala \r\nto resolve the Guatemalan claim peaceably and, in the \r\ninterim, to ensure that peace is maintained between our \r\ntwo countries.\r\nClimate change is another existential threat, \r\nlooming not only over Belize but over all nations of \r\nthe world, large and small. In our view, it is urgent \r\nthat the international community arrive at consensus \r\nas to the imminence and magnitude of the threat \r\nposed to humankind by climate change, as well as \r\non the way forward in dealing successfully with that \r\nperilous phenomenon. That is another threat that can \r\nbe successfully dealt with only by the United Nations. \r\nCombating the threat will necessitate huge expenditures, \r\nthe deployment of cutting-edge technology and, most \r\nlikely, the cessation of the use of fossil fuels.\r\nDeveloping countries such as Belize will need both \r\ntechnical and financial assistance from the international \r\ncommunity and international financial institutions to \r\nadapt to the changes being brought about by climate \r\nchange and to mitigate the deleterious effects thereof.\r\nBelize has established a national climate \r\n-change committee to coordinate our Government’s \r\ninterventions in all areas relating to climate change. We \r\nare also establishing a new climate-change policy and \r\nstrategy that provides for the scaling up of mitigation \r\nand adaptation efforts at all levels. We applaud the \r\nSecretary-General for his decision to convene a high-\r\nlevel meeting on climate change in the near future.\r\nThe security of its citizens is a paramount obligation \r\nof every Government. The Belize Government takes \r\nthat responsibility seriously. However, the threats to \r\nthe security of our citizens are so numerous in today’s \r\nglobalized world that no single country has the capacity \r\nto tackle the issue on its own. Consequently, Belize works \r\nactively with our multilateral and bilateral partners in \r\nfunding the necessary resources, technical assistance \r\nand training in our quest to secure our citizenry. We \r\nare party to the Central American Security Strategy, \r\nwhich is dedicated to combating the activities of \r\nnational, regional and transnational criminals. We also \r\ncollaborate closely with security and law enforcement \r\ncampesinos, fishermen and criminal elements engaged \r\nin narco-trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling, \r\nillegal panning for gold, the extraction of xaté and other \r\nexotic plants and animals, the illegal felling of timber \r\nand the pillaging of our ancient Mayan ruins. The \r\nfelling of timber in our rainforests is contributing to \r\nthe denuding of our mountains, which results in violent \r\nf looding in the rainy season and the transfer of topsoil, \r\nsand and silt into the sea. Those soils are then ultimately \r\ndeposited on our pristine barrier reef, choking and \r\ndestroying its fragile ecosystems and compromising \r\nthe health of the entire reef and the marine ecological \r\nsystem that thrives there.\r\nAdditionally, the increasing trespassing by \r\nGuatemalans into our country has given rise to more \r\nfrequent violent encounters between Guatemalans \r\nand members of the Belize Defence Force, resulting \r\nin fatalities in some instances. Those incidents put a \r\nheavy strain on the relations between our country and \r\nGuatemala and the peace of our region as a whole.\r\nWhile Belize appreciates that the activities of \r\nthe Guatemalans in our border regions are the direct \r\nresult of poverty and failed development in their \r\nown country, we are concerned by the fact that such \r\nactivities create the conditions for conflict. There are \r\nsome 65 Guatemalan villages along the 141-mile-long \r\nBelize-Guatemala border. The villagers there are \r\nlargely indigent and unemployed. Absent higher \r\nemployment and increased security patrols on both \r\nsides of the border, the incursions of Guatemalans will \r\nnot, in our view, abate, but will only get worse.\r\nBelize is resolved to do everything in its power \r\nto protect its citizens and territorial integrity, but our \r\nefforts alone will not be sufficient to put an end to the \r\nforays of Guatemalans into our country. Input from \r\nthe international community will be vital in assisting \r\nwith the development of income-generating enterprises \r\nin the border regions to ameliorate the poverty there, \r\nwhich is what compels Guatemalans to trespass in \r\nthose regions.\r\nBorder conflicts are dangerous by nature. In his \r\nmemoir, Interventions: A Life in War and Peace, former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan wrote:\r\n“[Conflicts] suck in their neighbours, send \r\nthousands of refugees spilling into other countries, \r\ncreate havens for armed groups and terrorists, \r\nand they cause the spread of criminal networks \r\nand cross-border lawlessness, including piracy. In \r\n22/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nregard, Belize would like to express its gratitude to \r\nthe United Nations and its related agencies, including \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund, UNICEF, UNESCO, \r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime \r\nand the Pan American Health Organization, which \r\nwork tirelessly to support the implementation of our \r\nnational development objectives. We also wish to thank \r\nthe many nations that are currently partnering with us \r\nin development.\r\nBelize would like to enlist the support of the \r\nUnited Nations in helping to persuade the international \r\nfinancial organizations that per capita gross domestic \r\nproduct is not in itself an accurate measure of a nation’s \r\nwealth or stage of development, particularly in the case \r\nof heavily indebted middle-income countries like ours. \r\nSuch a method of assessment would disqualify those \r\ncountries, including my own, from eligibility for badly \r\nneeded concessionary financing, and that eventuality \r\ncould well lead to reversals of their hard-won gains.\r\nThe Government of Belize is committed to a rights-\r\nbased approach to the development of our country and \r\npeople. To that end, we have embraced the international \r\nhuman rights regime and are making our best efforts to \r\nenable inclusive growth. In that regard, we are pleased \r\nto inform the Assembly that the Government of Belize \r\nhas, in consultation with its stakeholder partners at \r\nthe national level, submitted the report for its second \r\nuniversal periodic review for consideration by the \r\nHuman Rights Council at its seventeenth session, in \r\nOctober.\r\nI would like to inform the Assembly that we, too, \r\ncondemn the cowardly terrorist act that took place \r\nrecently in Kenya.\r\nEarlier I referred to my country’s position on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda — that the agenda \r\nmust be inclusive if we are to achieve meaningful \r\ndevelopment. We need to ensure that all our countries \r\nare allowed to participate in a meaningful manner, \r\nand that includes the people of the Republic of China \r\non Taiwan. We cannot deny the significant advances \r\nthey have been able to make in such a short time, or \r\ntheir contributions in support of global goals and \r\ncommitments, especially in the area of development \r\ncooperation. Their experience can teach us about \r\nadvancing our own development.\r\nauthorities in our region, including Canada, the United \r\nKingdom, the United States and Mexico.\r\nWe are very pleased with the adoption, earlier this \r\nyear, of the Arms Trade Treaty and we will, in due \r\ncourse, ratify it. We have also enacted a whole raft of \r\nlegislation to strengthen our crime-fighting capabilities.\r\nThe Belize Government invests as much as 26 per \r\ncent of its annual budgeted expenditure on the education \r\nsector. We believe that education is one of the quickest \r\nways to lift our people out of poverty. Also, one half of \r\nour population is below the age of 25 and approximately \r\n37 per cent is below the age of 18. They will all need \r\nworld-class education and skills training if they are \r\nto be able to compete successfully in global markets. \r\nAt this time, Belize is not able to provide education \r\nand training at that level locally and cooperates with \r\nits international partners for the provision, in large \r\nmeasure, of such education.\r\nNon-communicable diseases and disabilities \r\nare impacting the countries in the Caribbean region \r\nvery negatively. In our own country, the incidence of \r\ncancers, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, chronic lung diseases, \r\nhypertension and strokes is reaching epidemic \r\nproportions. Empirical data reveal that in low- \r\nand middle-income countries, non-communicable \r\n-isease-related impairments account for 65.5 per cent \r\nof persons living with disabilities. It is therefore urgent \r\nthat the United Nations work to address the aff lictions \r\nthat are blighting the lives of untold numbers of our \r\ncitizens.\r\nAt the most recent meeting of the Heads of \r\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community, a historic \r\ndecision was taken that the Community should pursue \r\nall the necessary steps to recover reparations for the \r\ndescendants of the victims of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade from the nations that participated in and benefited \r\nfrom that trade. Belize urges the United Nations to lend \r\nits support to that initiative, which seeks to address, at \r\nleast in part, the unspeakable evil perpetrated by the \r\nEuropean nations that participated in the trade.\r\nEarlier this year, Belize successfully rescheduled \r\nits debt obligations with its commercial bondholders, \r\nan exercise that enabled us to avoid the spectre \r\nof sovereign default. Despite that restructuring, \r\nhowever, Belize’s capacity to finance its development \r\nprogrammes is still challenged, and it continues to \r\nrely on cooperation with its bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners to achieve its development goals. In that \r\n13-48917 23/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\npursuing the complete and integrated fulfilment of our \r\ncommitments and on formulating a road map with clear \r\ndirections and specific goals for the post-2015 period.\r\nMorocco, while itself a stable country, is part of the \r\nSahel-Sahara region, which is highly unstable — hence \r\nthe importance for the Kingdom of Morocco of the \r\nsituation in the brotherly country of Mali and the \r\ndangerous challenges it has been dealing with recently. \r\nWe congratulate our Malian and African brothers and \r\nthe international community on the success of the \r\nrecent elections there and the progress Mali has made \r\nin achieving stability. The international community \r\nshould continue to support it at every level. The visit of \r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI to Mali to participate \r\nin the investiture ceremony for the new President of \r\nMali afforded an excellent opportunity for Morocco \r\nto renew its wholehearted commitment to supporting \r\nMali’s security, unity, stability and development. In \r\nhis speech, King Mohammed said that the solutions to \r\nother security crises demonstrated that the crisis in Mali \r\nrequired an approach that went beyond mere security. \r\nThat is why we support a three-pronged approach. The \r\nfirst dimension would be educational and ideological \r\nand would aim at spreading a culture of moderation \r\nand centrism and instituting a dialogue between the \r\ntwo peoples and their States, leading to the launching \r\nof cooperation in Islamic affairs and the training of \r\n500 mosque imams to be sent to Mali.\r\nThe second dimension would consist of \r\ndevelopment, with emphasis on bringing developing \r\ncountries together, particularly countries stricken by \r\ndrought and poverty, among other problems and crises, \r\nand empowering their people, as well as strengthening \r\ntheir capacity to achieve progress and development. \r\nThat is why we have launched development programmes \r\nin coordination with Mali and other countries in the \r\nregion.\r\nThe third key thrust would be the humanitarian \r\ndimension. Security crises provoke unspeakable \r\nsuffering for individuals and countries. Mali has seen \r\ntens of thousands of refugees leave the country and go \r\nto neighbouring countries, which is why it is important \r\nthat there be a coordinated regional approach. In \r\nBamako, the capital of Mali, we established a country \r\nhospital to relieve the suffering of the people in that \r\narea.\r\nWith respect to the Great Lakes region, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco welcomes the signing of the Peace, Security \r\nEvery year the Assembly votes to lift the economic \r\nembargo on Cuba. We continue to support that call.\r\nBelize also continues to call for an urgent and \r\npeaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East troubles us. As \r\nresponsible citizens of the world, we condemn the \r\nuse of chemical weapons and welcome the framework \r\nagreement — led by Russia and the United States of \r\nAmerica and supported by the Security Council — that \r\nwe hope will lead to the removal of all chemical and \r\nbiological weapons from Syria. We also call on other \r\nnations to abide by the Convention on the Prohibition \r\nof the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use \r\nof Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nAs we approach the end of an era and look towards \r\nthe post-2015 development process, our Government, \r\npolicymakers, planners and all levels of society will \r\nbe challenged to focus on what we want and what we \r\ncan achieve together. We must commit to a process \r\nof ensuring that we adopt goals and objectives that \r\nreflect global priorities and are adapted to our national \r\ncontexts. Our agenda must be reflective of the world’s \r\nmost pressing problems, which include, but are not \r\nlimited to, environmental sustainability, inequality, \r\ngrowth with equity and social inclusion.\r\nWe are confident that under your guidance, \r\nMr. President, that process will be an inclusive, \r\naccessible and transparent one.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Saad-Eddine El Othmani, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom of Morocco.\r\nMr. El Othmani (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould first like to congratulate you warmly, Sir, on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session, and to renew our support \r\nfor and highlight the efforts that Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon has made at every level to enable our \r\nOrganization to fulfil its role and responsibilities in \r\ndealing with the challenges of today’s world.\r\nWe commend your choice of theme for our debate, \r\nSir, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage”, which is very relevant and enables us to \r\nexchange views. From this rostrum, we pay tribute to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s tireless efforts to integrate the \r\nMillennium Development Goals into the Organization’s \r\nstrategic objectives. We hope that are our deliberations \r\nwill help to strengthen international consensus on \r\n24/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nand Joint Special Envoy Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi for the \r\njoint efforts they have made during this period with \r\nregard to the shedding of Syrian blood, the agreeing \r\non a resolution and the reaching of a solution prior to \r\nGeneva II, with a view to putting an end to the crisis \r\nin Syria.\r\nWe would like to reaffirm once again the \r\nimportance of the humanitarian aspect of the crisis. \r\nThere are 2 million refugees and tens of thousands \r\nof displaced persons, and thousands have been killed \r\nor wounded. This is the degree of suffering that the \r\ninternational community is called upon to reduce. The \r\nKingdom of Morocco and its King have paid particular \r\nattention to the humanitarian dimension, which is \r\nwhy we established a rural hospital in Jordan a year \r\nand a half ago to provide health services to our Syrian \r\nbrothers.\r\nIt is well known that Morocco has been involved in \r\nthe establishment of a Maghreb Union. Now is the time \r\nfor coming together regionally, not for isolation. It is the \r\ntime for cooperation and openness, not for unilateralism. \r\nTherefore, we are reactivating the Maghreb Union \r\nproject in order to fulfil the hopes of the peoples of \r\nthe five Maghreb countries and to help them to achieve \r\nstability, prosperity and sustainable development. \r\nHis Majesty the King has called for a promising and \r\nambitious Maghreb Union, and the Secretary-General \r\nhas made a similar appeal. The Maghreb Union would \r\nimplement peace and stability by taking a number \r\nof initiatives, including a joint mediation initiative \r\nundertaken with neighbourly Spain, pursuant to the \r\nappeal by the General Assembly in favour of mediation. \r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco answered the call by launching \r\nthe initiative and establishing partnership agreements \r\nbetween Moroccan and Spanish mediation centres to \r\nprovide training and invite the participation of other \r\ncountries in the region. The initiative was launched in a \r\nspirit of rapprochement, dialogue and cooperation and \r\nto promote mediation, which is important not only to \r\nstop conflicts when they have broken out but also to \r\nprevent them from occurring in the first place.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco’s decision to protect \r\nhuman rights is irreversible. It is part of a comprehensive \r\nstrategy and relies on an approach that favours the \r\nparticipation and advancement of people and the \r\nprotection of their dignity within the framework of a \r\ndevelopment-focused democratic model. Morocco has \r\ntherefore launched a number of projects and workshops, \r\nas well as major reforms, and made tremendous \r\nand Cooperation Framework Agreement, which will \r\ngreatly facilitate the real settlement of the crisis in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, which has gone on \r\nfor too long. We hope that all parties will respect the \r\nFramework Agreement and that they will honour their \r\ncommitments and pledges and support the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to establish a peace process, while \r\nrespecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThose challenges are part of various crises that we \r\nsee occurring in the Sahel and Saharan regions. The \r\nSecretary-General has deployed many efforts along \r\nthose lines. We are pleased with the high-level dialogue \r\non the Sahel that he organized on the margins of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the second consecutive year, \r\nas well as the visit he hopes to make to the region, \r\naccompanied by a representative of the World Bank. \r\nWe hope that the United Nations integrated strategy \r\nfor the Sahel will be finalized. Once again, Morocco \r\nreiterates that it will participate in all efforts to protect \r\nthe countries of the Sahel and the Sahara in order to \r\nstrengthen stability, security and development in the \r\nregion.\r\nMorocco reaffirms once more the need to set up \r\ninitiatives for the Atlantic coast States, given their \r\nsecurity, political, economic and social interrelationship \r\nand the challenges that obtain. We believe that \r\nstability and security in the region go beyond regional \r\nframeworks. We are therefore talking about a Sahel-\r\nMoroccan space for the purpose of maintaining stability \r\nin the region.\r\nWe condemn the recent terrorist attacks in Kenya. \r\nWe would ask the international community for greater \r\nefforts to bolster security and stability in that region.\r\nThe second issue that concerns us and the rest of \r\nthe international community is Syria. In that respect, \r\nwe commend the international community and the \r\nSecurity Council for adopting resolution 2118 (2013), \r\non the Syrian chemical weapons programme, and \r\nthe announcement of the date of 15 November for \r\nthe holding of the “Geneva II” Middle East peace \r\nconference in order to stop the violence in Syria and \r\nreach a political solution through dialogue that would \r\nmaintain the territorial integrity of Syria and the \r\nstability of its neighbours. In that regard, I would like \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his efforts. I would \r\nalso like to thank the Secretary-General of the League \r\nof Arab States, the League itself, its member States \r\n13-48917 25/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nachieve a sustainable political solution accepted by all. \r\nMorocco therefore launched an initiative on autonomy, \r\na practical and moderate solution that enjoyed the \r\nsupport of many countries friends of Morocco as well \r\nas of several regional organizations. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, the other parties involved, committed to their \r\n30-year stance and proposals, did not allow progress to \r\nbe made in the political process. I reiterate that Morocco \r\nis committed to working effectively and in good faith \r\nwith the Secretary-General and his Personal Envoy in \r\nall their efforts and with the Security Council in order \r\nto implement the successive resolutions adopted by the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFinally, on behalf of the Kingdom of Morocco, I \r\nwish to say that with the approach of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the Organization, we \r\nreaffirm our sincere commitment to its principles and \r\nto the active mobilization of our efforts so as to update, \r\nempower and strengthen it, given that it is the unique \r\nand optimal framework for meeting current and future \r\nchallenges.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Osman Mohammed Saleh, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the State of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Saleh (Eritrea): Let me first join previous \r\nspeakers in expressing my delegation’s deepest \r\nsympathies and condolences to the families of the \r\nvictims and to the people and the Government of Kenya \r\non the terrorist attack at Westgate Mall in Nairobi.\r\nIt is almost two generations now since Eritrea \r\nfirst begun to lodge petitions for justice with this \r\nbody. Sadly, in all of those instances, the Assembly \r\nhas persisted in ignoring Eritrea’s pleas, shuttering \r\nits doors as a “closed monastery”. Those setbacks \r\nnotwithstanding, Eritrea remains firmly convinced \r\nthat the promotion of peoples’ rights and interests and \r\nmutual respect among the community of nations will \r\nremain precarious without an international body that \r\nupholds the supremacy of international law and justice. \r\nAs such, our choice, like those of other peoples, has \r\nbeen and remains the funnelling of efforts towards \r\nexpediting the reform of the United Nations.\r\nTo focus exclusively on the harm done to the people \r\nand State of Eritrea may convey the false impression \r\nof an aberration in an otherwise effective and well-\r\nfunctioning United Nations. As it is, the particularity \r\nof our case only amplifies the wider backdrop of a \r\nUnited Nations debilitated by chronic weaknesses \r\nprogress in broadening the sphere of individual and \r\ncollective rights and freedoms, of preserving human \r\ndignity and of strengthening the protection of the rights \r\nof its citizens, especially the rights of women, children \r\nand persons with special needs.\r\nIn its amended 2011 Constitution, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco dedicated a chapter to respect for human \r\nrights as they are recognized internationally. Morocco \r\nhas always desired to preserve a balance between \r\nits international and national commitments and \r\npriorities. As a founding member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Morocco has participated effectively and \r\nconstructively in the formulation and implementation \r\nof the institutional texts of the Council, in particular \r\nthe universal periodic review. When it was decided \r\nto take another look at the rules and mechanisms in \r\n2011, Morocco was given the task of conducting the \r\nnegotiations on them. At the same time, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco enjoyed positive cooperation with the \r\nvarious institutions and mechanisms and interacted \r\nwith their recommendations, in particular the universal \r\nperiod review, treaties and special measures, whose \r\nassessments Morocco continues to welcome, facilitate \r\nand answer with its observations. Morocco hopes to \r\ngain the Assembly’s support for its candidacy for the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the period 2014-2016, in \r\norder to further contribute to strengthening the role of \r\nthe Council and to ensure the effectiveness necessary \r\nfor its operation.\r\nIn that connection, we have recently launched \r\nan initiative relating to immigration, especially \r\nillegal migration. Morocco wished to establish other \r\nmechanisms for refugees in connection with how we \r\naddress the issue and rights of immigration, especially \r\nillegal migration, and asylum. A few days ago, a new \r\nstatute on immigration was enacted and the right \r\nto asylum, so as to give new rights and documents \r\nto political refugees. All of this is a very important \r\ndevelopment for our country.\r\nI would like also to touch on the key issue of the \r\nterritorial integrity of Morocco and the issue of the \r\nMoroccan Sahara. For several years now our authorities \r\nhave followed the diligent efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Security Council to resolve the Sahara \r\nissue. Morocco complies with all Security Council \r\nresolutions and has acted in good faith with respect to \r\nthose resolutions and to the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The most recent resolutions called for a \r\nnew round of negotiations among the parties so as to \r\n26/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nMonetary Fund, in order to control the global economy, \r\nleading to an intractable global financial crisis with \r\nlethal ramifications for the majority of the peoples of \r\nthe world. We have also witnessed the misuse of the \r\nmass media and cultural centres in order to create \r\nfalse images and to promote decadent value systems, \r\nintimidate peoples and demonize any dissent; and the \r\nemployment of various subterfuges in order to control, \r\ndirectly or indirectly, all international, continental, \r\nregional, governmental and non-governmental bodies. \r\nThose manifestations of the current world order can be \r\ncorroborated, beyond abstract analysis, by numerous \r\nspecific cases and evidence related to particular events, \r\nplaces and time. That is precisely why the twenty-first \r\ncentury requires a revitalized United Nations that \r\ntranscends a bipolar or unipolar world order, and that \r\nis firmly rooted in the supremacy of, and respect for, \r\ninternational law and justice.\r\nAs I have intimated, Eritrea, like other African \r\nStates that were formed during the colonial scramble, \r\nshould have attained its sovereign independence during \r\nthe process of decolonization that transpired in the \r\naftermath of the Second World War. The inalienable \r\nnational rights of the Eritrean people were, however, \r\ncompromised to serve the strategic interests of the \r\nUnited States, which had emerged as a triumphant \r\nPower. Eritrea was therefore doomed to colonial rule \r\nby proxy. The people of Eritrea had to endure colonial \r\nsuppression for almost 40 years under successive \r\nregimes, which were propped up, alternately, by the \r\nUnited States for the first 23 years and by the former \r\nSoviet Union for the subsequent 17 years. The Eritrean \r\npeople had to wage their liberation struggle under those \r\nconditions, which exacted heavy sacrifices from them \r\nto achieve their independence in 1991. That historical \r\ntruth, coupled with other similar phenomena, illustrates \r\nthe perils of a world order that is driven by the rivalry \r\nof domineering super-Powers, and highlights the need \r\nand urgency for an effective United Nations.\r\nThe Eritrean people were neither compensated \r\nfor the transgressions meted out to them nor given \r\nrespite in the subsequent years. As they embarked on \r\nthe arduous task of rebuilding their war-torn country, \r\nthey again became pawns in the broader Horn of \r\nAfrica/Middle East chessboard of domination and \r\ninfluence and have suffered unjust and distorted policies \r\nfor the past 20 years. In that respect, border conflicts \r\nthat do not have political and legal justifications and \r\nthat were never raised prior to the independence of \r\nand shortcomings. In any event, my message today \r\nwill focus primarily on the urgency of reforming the \r\nUnited Nations and redressing the injustices committed \r\nagainst the people of Eritrea as well as other peoples of \r\nthe world.\r\nThe negative experiences during the first 50 \r\nyears of the existence of the United Nations and the \r\nparalysis and constraints under which the United \r\nNations had to operate in the context of the realities of \r\nthe Cold War in a bipolar world accentuated the need \r\nfor structural reform of the United Nations at that time. \r\nIn Eritrea’s case, our inalienable right to independence \r\nwas trampled at the onset of the Cold War, since the \r\ncountry was perceived as a mere pawn in the overriding \r\nstrategic rivalry of both super-Powers. Our liberation \r\nstruggle was likewise suppressed by both super-Powers \r\nin an alternating fashion because of the same strategic \r\nconsiderations and shifting alliances.\r\nYesterday’s history is too fresh in our minds to \r\ninduce in us any nostalgia for the Cold War. Our call \r\nfor reform of the United Nations is thus not influenced \r\nby some innate preference for the return of the old, \r\nbipolar configuration to replace the prevailing unipolar \r\nworld order. The fact is that the United Nations should \r\nhave undergone incremental reform and revitalization \r\nduring the 50 years of the Cold War. The end of the \r\nCold War was certainly the most auspicious moment for \r\nundertaking that belated task.\r\nIndeed, it is now clear in retrospect that had such \r\nreforms occurred then, the wars and destruction that have \r\nunfolded in the past 20 years could have been avoided. \r\nHowever, the major Powers that controlled the General \r\nAssembly and the various institutions and agencies \r\nof the United Nations, through partial hegemony, felt \r\nafter 1991 that they were better positioned to secure and \r\nconsolidate their total domination of the United Nations. \r\nThey blocked any reform of the United Nations, and \r\nso that historic opportunity for international peace and \r\njustice to prevail was lost.\r\nIn the past 20 years, we have witnessed excessive \r\ncontrol over global resources and the creation of \r\nspheres of influence, which has triggered international \r\ninstability; the use of force and coercion as primary \r\ninstruments for controlling global resources while \r\npreventing and denying others the opportunity to acquire \r\ncomparable military capabilities and technology; and \r\nthe deployment of international financial institutions, \r\nincluding the World Bank and the International \r\n13-48917 27/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nreform of the United Nations. The fact is that the \r\nAssembly has legal, moral and historical obligations \r\nand responsibilities entrusted to it by the peoples of the \r\nworld that it cannot shrug off.\r\nIn conclusion, I urge the United Nations to adopt \r\npractical resolutions that are commensurate with its \r\nlegal, political and moral responsibilities in order to, \r\nfirst, uphold the rule of law; secondly, bring to an end \r\nthe invasion of our sovereign territories; thirdly, lift \r\nthe unlawful and harmful sanctions against Eritrea; \r\nfourthly, terminate interventions that jeopardize the \r\npeace and stability of the peoples of the Horn of Africa; \r\nand, fifthly, deter all acts that breed crises, loss of life \r\nand destruction.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Samuel Santos López, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Santos López (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the people and Government of Nicaragua, \r\nComrade President Daniel Ortega Saavedra and \r\nComrade Rosario Murillo, I want to begin by paying \r\ntribute to the Commander of the revolution of our \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, leader of the free men and \r\nwomen of the world, Hugo Chávez Frías, who has left \r\nus a legacy of strength, hope and certainty of victory \r\nin defending the inalienable rights of humankind, such \r\nas sovereignty, justice, freedom, democracy, solidarity \r\nand peace.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of \r\nreconciliation and national unity of Nicaragua, led \r\nby Comrade Daniel Ortega Saavedra, I congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are pleased \r\nthat a representative of a brother country and member of \r\nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, \r\nPetrocaribe and the Community of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean States will guide us in the activities of \r\nthis important organ so that our efforts may contribute \r\nto the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which must be implemented by the \r\nOrganization.\r\nThe United Nations continues to require profound \r\nreform that cannot be delayed any longer. The position \r\nof some permanent members of the Security Council on \r\nthe issue can no longer be an insurmountable obstacle. \r\nWe continue to support the proposed reinvention of the \r\nUnited Nations proposed by our colleague Father Miguel \r\nEritrea in 1991 were subtly fomented to ensnare Eritrea \r\nin a spiral of crises.\r\nAlthough the Boundary Commission had rendered \r\nits final and binding decision in 2002, the spurious \r\nborder conflict that erupted under the Badme rubric \r\ncontinued to simmer for 11 years due to obstructive \r\nviolations by the United States Administration. The \r\nEritrean people were also subjected to a sustained \r\nhuman trafficking campaign and illicit measures aimed \r\nat undermining economic growth and development, \r\nas well as diplomatic and propaganda campaigns of \r\ndemonization.\r\nGoing even further, United States officials \r\nimposed unlawful sanctions against Eritrea in 2009 \r\nthrough the Security Council. Four years on, they \r\ninsist on maintaining the sanctions, despite the lack of \r\nany evidence or justification, by relying on the widely \r\ndiscredited reports of the Monitoring Group on Somalia \r\nand Eritrea.\r\nBeyond Eritrea, the same approaches and policies \r\nhave exacerbated crises and further undermined \r\nstability, development and cooperation in Somalia and \r\nother parts of the Horn of Africa. Despite that massive \r\nhostility and in the face of tremendous odds, the people \r\nand Government of Eritrea have remained steadfast, \r\nprioritized development efforts and the improvement \r\nof citizens’ lives, and have worked persistently to \r\nmake their modest contribution to regional peace and \r\nstability, including by fighting terrorism and piracy. \r\nTheir achievements, given the difficulties they faced, \r\nhave been remarkable, even though they fall far short \r\nof their aspirations.\r\nLooking forward, the people and the Government \r\nof Eritrea are prepared to link hands with regional and \r\ninternational partners, including the United Nations, \r\nand to work for the betterment of their country for \r\npeace, stability and regional integration in the Horn of \r\nAfrica and a fairer and more just world.\r\nThe transgressions that have been perpetrated \r\nagainst the people of Eritrea and other peoples in the \r\npast 20 years speak to the persistence of an unfair and \r\nunjust global order and the absence of a strong and \r\nrepresentative United Nations. And yet, the telltale signs \r\nof the advent of a new, promising era are discernible. In \r\nthat context, I add the voice of the Eritrean people to \r\nother voices in the world to urge the General Assembly \r\nto keep the f licker of hope alive in its current session \r\nand to adopt timely resolutions aimed at a fundamental \r\n28/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\nof the human rights of its citizens and its deep ethical \r\ncommitment to the common good.\r\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations has recognized our country’s remarkable \r\nprogress to ensure the food security of our citizens and \r\nto reduce the prevalence of undernourishment.\r\nOur Government guarantees the right to universal \r\nprimary education. Major programmes are under \r\nway — the “battle for ninth grade”, the intercultural \r\nbilingual education programme, the inclusive education \r\nprogramme and the comprehensive school nutrition \r\nprogramme.\r\nUN Women ranks Nicaragua among the leading \r\ncountries in the world with the highest percentage \r\nof women in the executive, legislative and judicial \r\nbranches. Today 42 per cent of the deputies in the \r\nNational Assembly are women. Women hold 54 per cent \r\nof positions in the executive branch, 60 per cent in the \r\njudicial branch and 50 per cent in municipal councils. \r\nWe established a Ministry of Women to promote gender \r\nequality and to empower women, while our laws ensure \r\nthat women enjoy human rights.\r\nNicaragua received the Americas Award \r\nof the International Training Centre for Local \r\nActors/Authorities (CIFAL) Atlanta and the United \r\nNations Institute for Training and Research for \r\nachieving its goals in reducing maternal mortality and \r\nin recognition of the national strategy called Maternal \r\nHomes. In 2006 the national maternal mortality rate \r\nwas 92.8 per 100,000 live births. In 2012 the rate was \r\nnearly half that, reduced to 50.9, and we continue \r\nfighting to reduce it further.\r\nWe continue our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. \r\nPreventive measures are being disseminated and \r\nsupportive care is provided to patients. In 2012 Nicaragua \r\nreceived recognition from the Pan American Health \r\nOrganization for its contribution to the community \r\nvigilance programme against malaria. Campaigns are \r\nbeing developed to curb dengue fever, leptospirosis \r\nand influenza. We have successfully carried out the \r\ncampaign “Live clean, live healthy, live a good life, live \r\nwell”, which aims to clean and beautify communities, \r\nprovide preventive health measures against epidemics \r\nand pandemics as well as to maintain a harmonious and \r\nrespectful relationship with one another and with the \r\nenvironment.\r\nd’Escoto Brockmann. The power of the Organization \r\nmust rest completely with the General Assembly.\r\nThe economic and financial situation imposed by \r\nglobal capitalism continues to rapidly dismantle the \r\nwelfare State in developed countries and seriously \r\naffects developing countries. Now more than ever, it \r\nbecomes essential to establish a new global economic \r\nmodel that is sustainable, based on justice, solidarity, \r\ncomplementarity and committed to the defence of the \r\nEarth and the environment.\r\nInternational democracy cannot exist without \r\nrespect for international law. Nicaragua continues \r\nto demonstrate with reliable facts its adherence to \r\ninternational law and its respect for the principle of \r\nresolving our differences through dialogue, negotiation \r\nand recourse to international bodies such as the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to settle territorial and \r\nother types of disputes.\r\nWe welcome the central theme selected by you, \r\nMr. President, for the Assembly’s sixty-eighth session, \r\nnamely, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage”. It is important, therefore, that we agree to \r\nlaunch an intergovernmental process for that new phase.\r\nIn Latin America and the Caribbean, we are \r\ndeepening our political, economic, social and cultural \r\nintegration process, all the while respecting our \r\ndiversity and building unity. Our Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States has been achieving a \r\nshared vision of social development, education, health, \r\nthe environment, energy and financing, among other \r\nsectors. It is now preparing to work collectively on \r\ncooperation, nuclear disarmament, fighting corruption, \r\nagriculture, science and technology.\r\nIn the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our \r\nAmerica and in Petrocaribe, Nicaragua has found a \r\nmodel of integration to overcome poverty, hunger and \r\ninequality, while strengthening the Central American \r\nIntegration System , the Mesoamerican Integration and \r\nDevelopment Project and its economic and commercial \r\nrelations with the international community and its \r\norganizations.\r\nIn this difficult context, Nicaragua continues \r\nto make progress. We have opted for a development \r\nmodel that produces results. Despite the difficulties \r\nand limitations, the Millennium Development Goals in \r\nNicaragua are being realized in a tangible manner that \r\ndemonstrates our Government’s respect and promotion \r\n13-48917 29/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nthat act, as well as the refusal of the United States to \r\ngrant visas to our Venezuelan brothers so that they \r\ncould attend this General Assembly plenary.\r\nWe reiterate our support for the brotherly people \r\nof Puerto Rico in their struggle for self-determination, \r\nindependence and social justice. Puerto Rico is one of \r\nthe last colonial enclaves in our continent. Its brave \r\npeople deserve our full support and solidarity in order \r\nto take their place within the United Nations and in our \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nthereby eliminating colonial situations from the region. \r\nWe express our solidarity with comrade Oscar López \r\nRivera and demand that he be freed immediately.\r\nWe express the hope that the peace process in \r\nColombia will come to fruition, bringing peace and \r\nsocial progress to the people of that country.\r\nWe support the efforts being made to achieve lasting \r\nsolutions to the conflicts in the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica. Nicaragua continues to support a negotiated \r\nsolution to the bloody conflict in Syria. The proposal \r\nof the Russian Federation to put an end to the war has \r\nreceived broad international support, including from \r\ncountries that are members of the Security Council \r\nwith the right of veto.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to the cause of \r\nthe Palestinian people in their struggle for self-\r\ndetermination and their legitimate right to establish \r\ntheir own State. We consider the resumption of talks \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel to be a step in the right \r\ndirection. The talks must be accompanied by the \r\nsuspension of the construction of Israeli settlements in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories.\r\nWe reiterate our solidarity with the struggle of the \r\nPolisario Front and the Sahrawi people, which this year \r\nmarks its fortieth anniversary.\r\nWe welcome the fiftieth anniversary of the African \r\nUnion under the banner of pan-Africanism and the \r\nAfrican renaissance.\r\nFurthermore, Nicaragua continues to support the \r\njust aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nfor greater participation in the various bodies and \r\nspecialized agencies of the United Nations.\r\nMuch has been said and heard in recent days about \r\nthe Grand Canal of Nicaragua. With that project, \r\nour Government intends to take advantage of the \r\nunprecedented transformation in global maritime trade \r\nAll of those projects are made possible by the \r\nenormous efforts our people, who have made a social, \r\neconomic and political model of dialogue, alliances and \r\nconsensus, recognized by all. Our people’s inexhaustible \r\ncapacity for hope and essential relationship with the \r\nChristian, socialist and solidarity model that we have \r\nbuilt together, in which all sectors of the country \r\nparticipate, has meant that our people continue to move \r\nahead while promoting peace, serenity and the full \r\nexercise of their rights.\r\nOur defence of peace and international security \r\nremains unwavering. Similarly, we continue to fight \r\nagainst drug trafficking and the various manifestations \r\nof transnational organized crime. Our retaining-wall \r\nstrategy produces positive results. We are committed at \r\nthe regional level to implementing the Central American \r\nSecurity Strategy. It is urgent that the international \r\ncommunity give more support through additional \r\nfinancial resources to the efforts and investment the \r\nCentral American countries are making against those \r\nscourges. Despite its limitations, Nicaragua invests \r\nconsiderable resources from its budget to ensure an \r\noptimal environment for public safety. Its successes \r\nare internationally recognized, and Nicaragua is seen \r\nas one of the safest countries in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean.\r\nWe are committed to the struggles of other peoples \r\nfor their full independence and sovereignty. Therefore, \r\nwe demand once again the immediate and unconditional \r\ntermination of the economic, trade and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba by the United States of \r\nAmerica and the immediate and unconditional release \r\nof the Cuban patriots imprisoned in that country. The \r\nUnited States must also stop its arbitrary and capricious \r\ninclusion of that brother country in its unilateral list of \r\nState sponsors of terrorism.\r\nWe reiterate our full support for the legitimate \r\nrights of the Argentine Republic in the sovereignty \r\ndispute relating to the question of the Malvinas Islands.\r\nWe recognize and welcome the progress in \r\nthe political process of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela and reject international campaigns aimed at \r\nweakening it.\r\nWe condemn, once again, the arbitrary conduct \r\nof the Government of the United States in preventing \r\nthe aircraft of our colleague, Nicolás Maduro Moros, \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, from \r\nflying through Puerto Rico’s airspace. We condemn \r\n30/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\n“To maintain international peace and security, and \r\nto that end: to take effective collective measures \r\nfor the prevention and removal of threats to the \r\npeace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression \r\nor other breaches of the peace, and to bring \r\nabout by peaceful means, and in conformity with \r\nthe principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”.\r\nOur world vibrates with dynamic political changes, \r\nsome welcome, and some threatening to the interests \r\nof small States and therefore unwelcome. Like other \r\nMember States, we prefer the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes, and therefore welcome the developments in \r\nthe Middle East, specifically in relation to Syria, where \r\nthe option of a peaceful and negotiated resolution has \r\ntaken precedence over the option of war. It is important \r\nthat in such matters we not get caught up in the emotions \r\nof the moment. We must be cerebral in our approach, \r\nbecause emotion is no substitute for intelligence, nor \r\nrigidity for prudence. We do not underestimate the \r\ndifficulties inherent in the resolution of issues and \r\ndisputes between nations in the Middle East. But we \r\nstand for the right to self-determination as a basic \r\nprinciple of any people’s existence, and hope that in \r\nother parts of the region the long-standing claims to \r\nentitlement on the part of the people of Palestine will \r\ncontinue to be pursued, primarily through persistent \r\nnegotiation as against any inclination to the threat of \r\nviolence and war. We are fortunate to have the United \r\nNations as a framework within which we can always \r\nproceed to negotiate with patience and persistence until \r\nagreement and/or compromise is reached.\r\nThe second principle of the Charter of the United \r\nNations is to develop friendly relations among nations \r\nbased on respect for the principle of the equal rights \r\nand self-determination of peoples, and to take other \r\nappropriate measures to strengthen universal peace. \r\nSaint Lucia, as a small State in a hemisphere of both \r\nsmall and large States, emphasizes the use of diplomacy \r\nas a prime instrument for the pursuit of normalized \r\nrelations. We note the increasing mutual involvement \r\nof the peoples on both sides of the China Strait and \r\nexpress the hope that that will lead to normal relations \r\nbeneficial to all the peoples of the world. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the response of the membership of the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization to embrace \r\nthe participation of the Republic of China on Taiwan in \r\nthat has taken place in the first decade of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Maritime trade is expected to continue \r\nto grow, particularly between Asia and the Americas, \r\nand our project is designed to complement the Panama \r\nCanal expansion. We are planning a canal for peace, for \r\nthe development of all peoples, constructed with a sense \r\nof responsibility as a world heritage site — a canal open \r\nto international investment in a reliable and transparent \r\nfashion, a canal that is the fulfilment of the dreams of \r\nthe General of Free Men, Augusto C. Sandino, and of \r\nthe people of Nicaragua, for their greater progress.\r\nClimate change continues to be a grave problem. \r\n“Our environmental, economic, political, social, and \r\nspiritual challenges are interconnected”, states the \r\nEarth Charter. In that statement lies the essence of \r\nour vision and our duty — to save Earth’s vitality and \r\nourselves as the human race.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Alva Romanus Baptiste, Minister for External \r\nAffairs, International Trade and Civil Aviation of Saint \r\nLucia.\r\nMr. Baptiste (Saint Lucia): I address the General \r\nAssembly today with a sense of deep humility — humility \r\nin the wake of the great architects of world peace who \r\nhave stood here before me — and pride. In that regard, \r\nI will utilize my maiden address to this body to pay \r\nhomage to those who fostered the birth and initial \r\ndynamics of the United Nations. I therefore find it more \r\nthan appropriate to utilize the principles contained in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations as a ready compass \r\nwith which to set my course as I navigate the issues that \r\noccupy the forefront of our attention.\r\nBefore indicating my own country’s perspectives \r\non present trends, let me take the opportunity to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, a representative of a Member \r\nState from my own Caribbean region, on your election \r\nto serve as President of the General Assembly. It is a \r\nclear acknowledgement by members of the General \r\nAssembly that all States, large or small, have a deep \r\nand broad interest in how international relations are \r\nevolving and a legitimate contribution to make towards \r\nresolving the problems that are having a negative \r\nimpact on us.\r\nAt this juncture, permit me to commence my \r\nnavigation. The first principle of the Charter reads as \r\nfollows:\r\n13-48917 31/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nGlobal interdependence demands that the strong \r\nhelp the weak, so that everyone can get strong. \r\nTherefore, the setting of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda is a watershed moment in global history, and all \r\ncountries must participate meaningfully in the process. \r\nThe rich must resist the temptation to retreat inward, \r\nas that can idle the global economic engine. The post-\r\n2015 development agenda must be driven by common \r\naspirations, shared goals and a unified vision of a \r\nsecure and stable world that we can proudly bequeath \r\nto our children.\r\nSaint Lucia and several other States have already \r\nembarked upon and completed post-2015 consultations, \r\nwith the support of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP). At least 20 such national \r\nconsultations have been conducted across the world, \r\nand they have provided invaluable inputs for the post-\r\n2015 agenda. They emphasize that Saint Lucia and \r\nother SIDS have serious vulnerabilities that seem to \r\nhave escaped the gross domestic product-focused eyes \r\nof some of our development partners. The post-2015 \r\nagenda must therefore address, in a very real sense, \r\nthe issues of concern to SIDS, such as the rise in sea \r\nlevel, non-communicable diseases, and the assessment \r\nof loss and damage caused by natural and man-made \r\ndisasters and the funding needed for recovery. We are \r\nalso concerned about the causes of climate change, \r\nparticularly our over-dependence on fossil fuels, and \r\nits destructive impact on the debt profiles of our small \r\nand vulnerable economies.\r\nIn that regard, we want to arrest the adverse \r\nconsequences of climate change before they cripple us, \r\nand we want to accelerate the transition to renewable \r\nenergy using clean, green technology. In May 2012, \r\nour region hosted the Conference on Achieving \r\nSustainable Energy for All in Small Island Developing \r\nStates in Barbados and, together with UNDP and other \r\ninternational partners, we resolved to set targets for \r\nincreasing the renewable component of our energy \r\nmix. Moreover, a month ago in Barbados, at the \r\nthird interregional preparatory meeting for the third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, to be held in Apia, Samoa, in 2014, SIDS \r\nreaffirmed their commitment and renewed calls for the \r\nworld to pay attention to their special vulnerabilities.\r\nThat is in keeping with the fourth principle of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, which asserts that the \r\nOrganization is to be a centre for harmonizing the \r\nactions of nations in the attainment of the common \r\naspects of its proceedings. That can be an appropriate \r\nmodel for the further engagement of Taiwan in the \r\nactivities of international organizations, thus permitting \r\nthat country to play its role more effectively in global \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the same context, the Government of Saint Lucia \r\nreiterates its support for the inclusion of Cuba in all \r\nregional and hemispheric organizations that it wishes \r\nto join. We support the removal of what can clearly be \r\nseen as forced exclusions, which are surely no longer \r\npermissible under the new rules and regimes of balanced \r\ndiplomacy. As is evident, the exclusion of Cuba from \r\nnormal and complete intercourse remains an open \r\nwound in the heart of our hemisphere. It is unnecessary \r\nand needs to be ended. Saint Lucia therefore emphasizes \r\nits support for persistent international efforts towards \r\nthe removal of the unconscionable embargo that inhibits \r\nCuba’s legitimate efforts at economic growth and full \r\nhemispheric cooperation.\r\nThe third principle of the Charter is to achieve \r\ninternational cooperation in solving international \r\nproblems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian \r\ncharacter, and in promoting and encouraging respect \r\nfor human rights and for fundamental freedoms for \r\neveryone without distinction to race, sex, language \r\nor religion. That is in consonance with the theme \r\nchosen for this year’s general debate, namely, “The \r\npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. \r\nOver a decade ago, when the world was entering the \r\ntwenty-first century, the United Nations took the lead \r\nin setting the international development agenda. At \r\nthat time, we made a loud and clear declaration of war \r\nagainst extreme poverty and hunger, illiteracy, gender \r\ninequality, child mortality, poor maternal health care, \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, environmental \r\ndegradation, as well as against the forces that seek to \r\nfragment our global partnership for development.\r\nOur declaration was appropriately entitled the \r\nMillennium Declaration, and the goals contained \r\ntherein were time-bound and target-driven. Today, \r\nless than two years before the 2015 deadline arrives, \r\nwe find ourselves facing new, and increasingly critical, \r\ndevelopment challenges. Youth unemployment has \r\nreached crisis proportions globally, and high debt levels \r\nhave threatened the solvency and stability of small \r\nStates. Climate change and the increasing ferocity \r\nof natural and man-made disasters are threatening \r\nthe environmental sustainability, and even the very \r\nexistence, of small island developing States (SIDS).\r\n32/33 13-48917\r\nA/68/PV.21 30/09/2013\r\npolitical strategies and reshape our external relations \r\nalong more contemporary and multidimensional \r\nlines. In that regard, Saint Lucia has been making a \r\nspecial effort in the area of regional and international \r\noutreach. Within our hemisphere, we have witnessed \r\nthe establishment and active engagement of both the \r\nUnion of South American Nations and the Community \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States, and Saint \r\nLucia, like other Caribbean Community States, has \r\nactively engaged with them where eligible.\r\nIt is in that spirit that we have also joined the \r\nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America, \r\nso as to broaden our activities in the hemisphere and \r\nensure that we take full advantage of efforts to advance \r\nour country’s economic growth, reduce the economic \r\ninequalities that result from our small size and ensure \r\nour full participation in the regional and global \r\ndecision-making that inevitably affects us.\r\nAs I speak of a better balance of global relations \r\nand the evolution of emergent political principles and \r\npractices, Saint Lucia joins with other CARICOM \r\ncolleagues in drawing attention to a decision of the \r\nCARICOM Heads of State, taken at their thirty-fourth \r\nregular meeting, in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago, \r\nin July. That decision mandates our Governments to \r\ncollectively seek reparations, on behalf of our citizens \r\nand countries, for the period of exploitation experienced \r\nduring the transatlantic slave trade. Our Governments \r\nhave therefore initially agreed to the establishment of \r\na Caribbean reparations commission that will prepare \r\nthe relevant documentation and strategies for pursuing \r\nthe practical achievement of that goal, with a central \r\nfocus of righting the wrongs of the past and elevating \r\nthe status of our people. In that regard, we will continue \r\nto conduct a process of diplomatic outreach, not only \r\nwithin our own hemisphere and the States of the African \r\ncontinent, the geographic location of our ancestors, but \r\nalso within the wider United Nations family.\r\nI would like to reiterate the importance for small \r\nStates like Saint Lucia of deliberate and sustained \r\nefforts to resolve disputes peacefully. We support \r\nstrengthening the institutional arrangements of the \r\nUnited Nations in order to help it better fulfil its \r\nmandate. As the Assembly is aware, CARICOM has \r\nbeen actively engaged in developments relating to \r\nreform of the Security Council. It is an issue that Saint \r\nLucia’s Permanent Representative has been directly \r\ninvolved in, particularly the question of expanding both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent membership of the \r\nends mentioned earlier. In that regard, we recognize a \r\nnumber of United Nations initiatives.\r\nFirst, we note that the outcome document of the \r\nHigh-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Millennium Development Goals requested the \r\nSecretary-General to initiate thinking on a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and to include recommendations \r\nin his annual report on efforts to accelerate progress on \r\nachieving the MDGs.\r\nSecondly, we recognize that the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development has \r\ninitiated an inclusive intergovernmental process for \r\npreparing a set of sustainable development goals.\r\nThirdly, we note that the work of the \r\nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing, on which Saint \r\nLucia is represented, has proceeded in a positive \r\nfashion. That work includes initiatives of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) region aimed at applying \r\npolicies to address the effects of the global recession \r\nand of new trends and rules that negate our effective \r\nparticipation in international trade. Such initiatives \r\nare promoted by our regional institutions, such as the \r\nCaribbean Development Bank, whose President recently \r\nhighlighted the need for new urgency in implementing \r\npolicies to help the Bank’s member States to emerge \r\nfrom the effects of the global recession.\r\nFourthly, we take special cognizance of the special \r\nevent just held and convened by you, Mr. President, to \r\nfollow up on efforts to achieve the MDGs. We concur \r\nwith the recommendations that propose a framework \r\nfor countries like mine to come up with an evolving \r\nresponse to the new international environment that \r\nrecognizes how urgent it is that developed countries \r\nfulfil their official development aid commitments, and \r\nhow critical the MDGs are for meeting the basic needs \r\nof people in developing countries.\r\nIt is vital that all such initiatives on the part of the \r\nglobal community include arrangements such as an \r\nadaptation fund that can enhance the ability of small \r\nisland developing States to begin constructing facilities \r\nthat can protect our countries from sea-level rise and \r\nnatural disasters. Do we lie supine on our backs and hug \r\nthe elusive phantom of hope? No. Given the turbulent \r\nand unpredictable world situation that we small States \r\nface, we have been compelled to reassess, restructure \r\nand reformulate domestic and foreign policy postures \r\nto enable us to realistically readjust our economic and \r\n13-48917 33/33\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.21\r\nIt is to that aim that my country and I devote every \r\nmoment of our time.\r\nAs I conclude, Mr. President, I thank you and \r\nextend to you Saint Lucia’s best wishes and support \r\nfor your successful tenure of office as you pursue \r\nthe tasks of the coming year, some visible and some \r\nundoubtedly not yet foreseen. Saint Lucia’s hope is that \r\nas we navigate uncharted waters, we continually refer \r\nto the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nto which I have referred, in order to ensure that our \r\ngreat Organization remains on course, as together, with \r\nmutual purpose and mutual aid, we make a new period \r\nin history.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\nCouncil and thereby giving that body’s decision-making \r\ngreater legitimacy. We look forward to further progress \r\non the matter.\r\nFor my part, I can only echo the words of the great \r\nRussian writer Nikolai Ostrovsky, who said,\r\n“Man’s dearest possession is life. It is given to \r\nhim but once, and he must live it so as to feel no \r\ntorturing regrets for wasted years, never know the \r\nburning shame of a mean and petty past; so live \r\nthat, dying, he might say: all my life and all my \r\nstrength were given to the finest cause in all the \r\nworld — the fight for the liberation of mankind”.\r\n"
