"In the absence of the President, Mrs. Mesquita \r\nBorges (Timor-Leste), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. János Martonyi, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Hungary.\r\nMr. Martonyi (Hungary): Defining the post-2015 \r\nstrategy for development is among the most important \r\nlong-term multilateral agendas existing today. The task \r\nis complex, but the mission — to make our common \r\ndevelopment sustainable — should be clear. It is not just \r\na synonym for the protection of the environment. The \r\nmission is to make sure that our societies, economies, \r\nenvironment and partnerships will serve us all and \r\nserve the generations to come.\r\nBy 2030, our population will be 9 billion people, \r\n65 per cent of whom will live in cities, forming \r\nconsumer societies with ever-growing demands but \r\nusing the same or a declining pool of natural resources. \r\nCivil societies and other non-governmental players have \r\nmore influence than ever on our values and decisions. \r\nWe are racing against climate change. Our perceptions \r\nof progress, equity, inequality, aff luence and resource \r\nmanagement are changing as we speak. The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda has to reflect these changes.\r\nAs we face a turning point in our history and the \r\nstate of the Earth, it is only with a fundamental shift in \r\nmindset that humanity will succeed in a transition to \r\nglobal sustainable development. We have to accelerate \r\nprogress towards the goals set out in the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. However, we know that by 2015 \r\nwe may not be able to meet all the targets we set in \r\n2000. Therefore, the next important step is to create \r\na single agenda through which we will complete the \r\nunfinished business and make sure that the results \r\nwill last even in the light of the tremendous challenges \r\nfacing humankind.\r\nWe should aim at eradicating extreme poverty \r\nin a single generation. The transformation to \r\nsustainable development is costly; however, it would be \r\nincomparably more costly to miss the chance. We should \r\nlearn from past mistakes and find better alternatives. \r\nWe all need economic growth. We all need justice, \r\nrespect for human rights, gender equality, dignity, good \r\ngovernance and successfully implemented national \r\ndevelopment plans. We all deserve to live free of want \r\nand from fear of devastating conflicts. Our objective \r\nshould be not a zero-sum game but a win-win outcome. \r\nWe all share the consequences; therefore we should be \r\naware of our common responsibility as well.\r\nThe decisions we make today will also need to be \r\nrelevant in 15 years. When our successors look back \r\nin 2030 on the agenda we are about to decide on, they \r\nshould acknowledge the purpose, priorities and targets \r\njointly set. They should be convinced that our action \r\nhad the right impact and made this world a better place. \r\nI thank the Member States for the confidence they \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.22\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n22nd plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 30 September 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The next Forum is \r\ndue to take place in November and will be dedicated, \r\namong other things, to the relationship between human \r\nrights and sustainable development.\r\nHungary is committed to disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation efforts, which are fundamental for \r\nmaintaining global peace and security. We urge all \r\ncountries to ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. \r\nWe also support the establishment of a zone free of \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, as \r\nforeseen by the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons.\r\nMy country was greatly honoured to chair the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency’s International \r\nConference on Nuclear Security in July and sincerely \r\nhopes that the results of that Conference will contribute \r\nto a safer world.\r\nOn the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \r\n(CTBT), I am confident that its entry into force will \r\ngreatly strengthen global peace and security. Only \r\na treaty in force will confine the chapter on nuclear \r\ntesting to the history books. We therefore need to \r\nfurther intensify our respective efforts. I and my \r\nfellow article XIV Coordinator Mr. Marty Natalegawa, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, will make an \r\nattempt to bring us closer to that goal. I look forward \r\nto our co-coordinatorship of the CTBT for the period \r\n2013-2015 with a view to accelerating the ratification \r\nprocess.\r\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria was a \r\ncrime against humanity. The international community \r\nhas finally embarked on action to ensure that similar \r\nattacks will never be repeated. We urge that the \r\nperpetrators of all war crimes be brought to justice. \r\nWithout justice there is no reconciliation. Without a \r\nchance for reconciliation, there is no lasting settlement. \r\nWe welcome the United States-Russia agreement on \r\nthe framework for the elimination of Syrian chemical \r\nweapons as well as the consequent resolutions adopted \r\nby the Executive Council of the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons, and the Security \r\nCouncil. We look forward to a timely, transparent and \r\nfull-scale implementation under the watchful eyes of \r\nthe international community.\r\nHungary is ready to provide chemical and biological \r\nexperts on the ground to facilitate those international \r\nhave shown in Hungary by entrusting us to co-chair \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We will do our best to achieve a consensual, \r\nforward-looking, win-win formula as the outcome of \r\nthe negotiating process.\r\nHungary attaches the utmost importance to the \r\nissue of water and sanitation. We believe that it needs \r\nto be addressed in an integrated way to achieve a \r\nhuman rights-based social development prosperity and \r\necological balance. Water is a source of life, health, \r\nprosperity and a shared future, but it can also be a \r\nsource of risk.\r\nIn order to take stock of the various international \r\ndevelopments in the field of water, Hungary has \r\ndecided to organize the Budapest Water Summit, to \r\nbe held in our capital from 8 to 11 October. Hungary \r\nis a downstream country with about 95 per cent of all \r\nf luvial waters originating beyond our State borders. We \r\nhave accumulated precious know-how in f lood control, \r\ndrinking water, wastewater treatment and irrigation, \r\njust to list a few. The Summit will be accompanied by \r\na science forum, a youth forum, a civil society forum, \r\na business leaders’ forum and Expo, and a philanthropy \r\nround table. We look forward to welcoming Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and the United Nations agencies \r\nactive in the field of water, as well as other international \r\nand national leaders to the conference. More than 100 \r\ncountries and international institutions have confirmed \r\nthey will be represented in Budapest. The Summit \r\nwill adopt the Budapest Statement, and we hope that \r\nit will, as a synthesis document, greatly contribute to \r\nand facilitate the discussions and negotiations on the \r\nsustainable development goals.\r\nThe appalling situations in various parts of the \r\nworld leave no doubt as to the interdependence and \r\nmutually reinforcing nature of democracy, peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights. A cross-policy \r\napproach that takes account of those interrelationships \r\nshould be integrated into the work of the various bodies \r\nand forums of the United Nations.\r\nHungary welcomes the measures that the United \r\nNations system is introducing to mainstream human \r\nrights. Likewise, it encourages national initiatives \r\nand contributions to the protection of human rights. \r\nHungary remains dedicated to the promotion of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. It was in this spirit \r\nthat the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Hungary \r\nestablished the annual Budapest Human Rights Forum, \r\n13-48953 3/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nI could not find a better opportunity than from \r\nthis rostrum to convey the gratitude of the people and \r\nGovernment of Guinea to the international community \r\nand to reiterate my country’s commitment to the \r\nprinciples and purposes of our Organization, . I should \r\nalso like to pay a well-deserved tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, whose devotion and, above all, \r\ncompetence have strengthened the central role of the \r\nUnited Nations in managing crises and improving the \r\nliving conditions of our populations.\r\nI am firmly convinced that the new President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. John William Ashe, a man of \r\nthe South, will understand better than anyone what is at \r\nstake in the theme for this session. I assure him of the \r\nfull cooperation of my delegation in carrying out his \r\nnoble mission. We also express our great appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his efforts in \r\nmaintaining the Assembly at its highest level.\r\nWorld peace and security are at the heart of our \r\nconcerns and should be the subject of our full attention. \r\nA number of conflicts have been ended. Countries such \r\nas Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire and Burundi have \r\nbeen able to turn the page of war in order to dedicate \r\nthemselves to peacebuilding, thereby guaranteeing \r\nnational reconstruction and sustainable development. \r\nThe international community has the duty to support \r\nand assist them.\r\nIn this context, I should like to evoke the case of \r\nMali, which is emerging from a period of crisis. Sadly, \r\nthe recent past of that brotherly country reminds us \r\nof the vulnerability of our States to terrorism and \r\nextremism, as well as the fragility of our institutions. \r\nThe international community mobilized unanimously \r\nto maintain Mali’s sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nand to restore the authority of its State and constitutional \r\nlegality.\r\nThe peace that reigned in the presidential election \r\nin Mali certainly augurs a new era of prosperity for \r\nthe country. Mali urgently needs assistance in order \r\nto build peace, reconcile the Malians and rebuild their \r\ncountry. It needs assistance to strengthen its security, \r\nwhich is indivisible from the Sahelo-Saharan region. \r\nWe must always recall that terrorism never sleeps; we \r\nmust combat and defeat it. International security is at \r\nstake.\r\nGuinea will never abandon its solidarity with Mali. \r\nIts presence within the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali testifies to our \r\nefforts. We urge the Syrian authorities to take full \r\nresponsibility to ensure that their chemical weapons are \r\nstored securely until inspection and destruction, and do \r\nnot fall into the hands of any other State or non-State \r\nactor. Syria should live up to its commitments, including \r\nby providing full access to the international inspectors.\r\nWe hope that these developments will bring us \r\ncloser to a lasting and sustainable political solution, \r\nwhich should remain the backbone of our efforts in \r\nthe Syrian crisis. Well over 100,000 lives have already \r\nbeen lost and 5 million people displaced in this conflict. \r\nMost regrettably, it was only after a terrible chemical \r\nattack last August that the Security Council became \r\nready to fulfil its duties and embarked on action. I urge \r\nall partners in the international community to seize \r\nthis momentum and reinvigorate the process leading \r\nto the long-overdue “Geneva II” international peace \r\nconference on Syria.\r\nLast, but not least, my country is shocked by and \r\nstrongly condemns the surging terrorist attacks against \r\ncivilians at the Westgate Mall in Kenya, students in \r\nNigeria, and Christian, Muslim and other communities \r\nin Pakistan, Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Our \r\nsolidarity and sympathy go to the innocent victims.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. François Lounceny Fall, Minister of \r\nState for Foreign Affairs and Guineans Abroad of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea.\r\nMr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): It is with \r\nlegitimate pride that I address the General Assembly, a \r\nsymbol of the resolve of peoples to pool their potential \r\nin order to forge a better world where peace, security, \r\nprosperity and solidarity will allow humankind to face \r\nthe many challenges before it.\r\nMy pride is as great as my country, since we as \r\na nation have just reached an important stage in our \r\nhistory by finalizing the transitional process and holding \r\nlegislative elections on 28 September. Guinea has thus \r\njoined the melting pot of democratic nations that respect \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. It was able \r\nto do so thanks to the assistance of its partners whose \r\naction catalysed a fruitful dialogue among the actors \r\nof Guinean political life. The elections have certainly \r\nopened the path to widespread development blazed by \r\nthe Government so that the Guinean population can \r\nfinally take advantage of its rich potential.\r\n4/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nI cannot fail to raise the issue of Western Sahara, \r\nwhere we call on all stakeholders to spare no effort to \r\narrive at a political solution. Our solidarity with Cuba \r\nis as strong as ever as we seek to have the embargo \r\nunjustly imposed on its people lifted.\r\nI should like to weigh in on a subject of major \r\nconcern that is the focus of the international \r\ncommunity’s attention — the Palestinian question. \r\nIn spite of the many injunctions of the international \r\ncommunity, the Palestinian people continue to suffer. \r\nArbitrary violence, settlements and the seizure of goods \r\ncontinue to be the people’s daily lot. Guinea reiterates \r\nits unceasing support for the Palestinian cause, in the \r\nbelief that peace and stability in the Middle East require \r\nthe implementation of the relevant resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council and the road map of the Quartet, which \r\nforesees the creation of an independent, sovereign and \r\nviable Palestinian State living side by side and in peace \r\nwith Israel within safe and internationally recognized \r\nborders. We express the hope that the negotiations \r\nunder way will enable the Palestinian people to finally \r\nenjoy their inalienable rights.\r\nEver since its creation, the United Nations has \r\nspared no effort to promote peace, security and \r\ninternational cooperation in order to ensure the \r\nharmonious development of humankind. In this context, \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals were a source of \r\nreal hope for developing countries. The undeniable \r\nprogress made in many areas — growth, education, \r\ngender equality, and maternal and child health — has \r\nlargely contributed to pushing back the borders of \r\npoverty. Nevertheless, many important challenges have \r\nstill to be met.\r\nAt a time when the international community is \r\ninvesting in the creation of a post-2015 development \r\nagenda, we must recognize that the results achieved by \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals have not lived up to \r\nour hopes. The eradication of extreme poverty depends \r\non the strengthening of the human development base and \r\nthe promotion of a competitive economy that respects \r\nthe environment, which is an engine of inclusive growth \r\nand decent work. It also depends on governance that is \r\nfavourable to sustainable development in the context of \r\npeace and security.\r\nIn this quest, the focus must be on the monitoring, \r\ntransparency and management of our natural resources. \r\nWe must join in international partnership on the basis \r\nof reaffirmed solidarity and shared responsibility. That \r\ncommitment to the stabilization of the subregion. The \r\nGuinean Government reiterates its determination to \r\nwork for the re-establishment of constitutional order \r\nin Guinea-Bissau on the basis of the recommendations \r\nof the Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), the African Union, the International \r\nContact Group on Guinea-Bissau, the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, the European Union \r\nand the United Nations.\r\nThe Mano River Union is an essential link for the \r\nconsolidation of peace in West Africa and deserves \r\nour full attention. The international community, and \r\nin particular the United Nations and ECOWAS, must \r\nwork to support that organization in its global approach \r\nto meeting the security and socioeconomic challenges.\r\nWe welcome the determination of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to assist Sierra Leone, Liberia and \r\nGuinea in their efforts in security and defence sector \r\nreform, while promoting youth employment and \r\nthe empowerment of women on the basis of national \r\nreconciliation.\r\nWith respect to the Great Lakes region, we urge \r\nthe parties to renounce violence and to firmly commit \r\nto bringing peace to the region via adherence to the \r\nFramework Agreement of 24 February. We thank the \r\nMediator, President Denis Sassou Nguesso, for his \r\nefforts to re-establish sustainable peace in eastern \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes \r\nregion.\r\nAs for the Central African Republic, urgent \r\nmeasures are needed to prevent a collapse of the State \r\nand to avert the chronic instability that threatens the \r\ncountry. We urge the Sudan and South Sudan to pursue \r\ndialogue in order to solve pending questions, specifically \r\nthe status of Abyei province, and to relaunch bilateral \r\ncooperation.\r\nGiven the deteriotation of the situation in Syria, the \r\ninternational community must strive further to bring an \r\nend to the relentless violence and massive destruction \r\nof lives and property. Guinea condemns the use of \r\nchemical weapons, which violates international norms \r\nand human dignity. Robust action must be undertaken \r\nfor the destruction of the chemical arsenal in Syria, in \r\naccordance with the Russian-American initiative and \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2118 (2013). At the same \r\ntime, the legal framework prohibiting the manufacture, \r\nstockpiling and use of chemical weapons must be \r\nstrengthened.\r\n13-48953 5/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nfear, illness or the spectre of ignorance. Our duty is to \r\nleave to future generations an environment conducive \r\nto sustainable development. Together we will save \r\nhumanity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Albert del Rosario, Secretary for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Del Rosario (Philippines): On behalf of \r\nthe Philippine Government, I proffer my warmest \r\ncongratulations to the President on his election. I wish \r\nhim success and assure him of my country’s steadfast \r\nsupport for his presidency.\r\nThe theme that has been selected for this session \r\nis indeed timely and relevant. We must start setting \r\nthe stage for the new development agenda that will \r\nsucceed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nframework. Barely two years before its deadline, \r\nconsiderable work still lies ahead of us. For instance, the \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis has underscored \r\nthe need for reform towards greater systemic \r\ncoherence; the multilateral trading system remains \r\nfrozen in the past; and the persistence of an outdated \r\ndevelopment paradigm results in policy prescriptions \r\nand conditionalities inimical to the interests of many \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nAs we set the stage for the post-2015 framework, let \r\nus reaffirm the very raison d’être of the United Nations, \r\nwhich is to accord every person the opportunity at a life \r\nthat is secure, progressive and dignified. That purpose \r\nis enshrined in the Philippine Constitution and is central \r\nto President Benigno Aquino III’s social contract \r\nwith the Filipino people. Under President Aquino’s \r\nleadership, my country has embarked on a journey \r\nalong a straight path — or, as we say in Filipino, “daang \r\nmatuwid” — resolving to work towards inclusive \r\ngrowth, combating corruption, promoting transparency \r\nand accountability, improving global competitiveness, \r\nmaking better use of resources, achieving just and \r\nlasting peace, and upholding the rule of law.\r\nThe Aquino Administration firmly maintains that \r\ngood governance is good economics. As a result, the \r\nPhilippines is reaping the first fruits of its hard work. \r\nIn the past four quarters, the Philippine economy has \r\nexperienced unprecedented growth of over 7 per cent. \r\nAs a result, the Philippines won three investment-grade \r\nratings and is now considered a growth engine in the \r\nregion.\r\nmust be our new vision. In the formulation of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, we must take into account the \r\nsynergies arising from the complementarity between \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. We must also particularly stress \r\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation, and promote \r\ninnovative financing in order to bridge the gap in \r\nofficial development assistance.\r\nIn the unanimous resolve to fight marginalization, \r\nmy delegation remains convinced that Africa’s fight \r\nto master its own destiny will be understood. The \r\ndetermination of Heads of State on the continent to \r\nadopt a common African position and to create a \r\nhigh-level committee charged with forging regional \r\nand intercontinental alliances around the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda are part of the dynamic to build \r\na better world without conflict and poverty and their \r\ncorollaries.\r\nMy country has always believed in the value \r\nof multilateralism, the only guarantor of peace, \r\ninternational security and shared development. The \r\nUnited Nations is still the irreplaceable framework \r\nfor cooperation and the management of world affairs. \r\nGuinea, as in the past, will continue to contribute to \r\nthis lofty fight in order to ensure a better future for \r\nhumankind. That is why it shares the concerns of the \r\ninternational community and invites it to begin setting \r\nthe post-2015 stage.\r\nWe leaders must outline how this new world \r\npartnership will work. It is time to draw lessons from \r\nthe past in order to launch a fruitful dialogue in which \r\nall development actors will participate with mutual \r\nrespect and collective responsibility in the emergence of \r\nan international society that is more just, equitable and \r\nmore unified. There is a need for a new international \r\narchitecture. The world would do better if all nations, \r\nlarge and small, strong and weak, effectively played \r\ntheir part towards achieving the overall well-being of \r\nhumankind.\r\nThe Republic of Guinea will not cease its call \r\nfor the United Nations system to be reformed and \r\nadapted to the needs of the moment. It is a question \r\nof equity and justice. Our will is unshakeable and the \r\nmomentum is irreversible because the aspirations of \r\npeople who are passionate about peace, freedom and \r\nprogress are profound. It is high time to listen to the \r\nvoices of those who do not have a voice — the poorest \r\nand most vulnerable. No one should suffer from hunger, \r\n6/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nThese important elements will further enrich the \r\nUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework \r\n2012-2018 for the Philippines. With the overall theme \r\n“Supporting inclusive, sustainable and resilient \r\ndevelopment”, the United Nations Development \r\nAssistance Framework seeks to fully align United \r\nNations work with the Philippine Development Plan \r\n2011-2016.\r\nMy Government is actively participating in the \r\ninternational discourse on sustainable development \r\nand in crafting the post-2015 development agenda. The \r\nPhilippines was one of 66 countries chosen by the United \r\nNations to conduct open, inclusive and transparent \r\nconsultations with a broad range of stakeholders \r\naimed at generating perspectives on how the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda framework should look. We took \r\nto this task earnestly by undertaking consultations \r\nwith more than 500 stakeholders representing the \r\nGovernment, civil society, the business community and \r\nacademia.\r\nOur national consultations on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda have identified the following \r\nbuilding blocks of the new framework, as well as \r\nthe development themes deemed most relevant to the \r\nPhilippines. These building blocks are composed of \r\nfour principles, five themes and various development \r\nenablers, and were offered to the United Nations \r\nsystem as the Philippines’ contribution to the ongoing \r\ndiscourse.\r\nWe need look no further than the United Nations \r\nCharter to identify the building blocks for the global \r\npost-2015 development agenda. For this agenda to be \r\nrelevant and responsive, it must be anchored in four \r\nmain principles: human rights; equality, equity, people \r\nempowerment, social cohesion and justice; accountable \r\ngovernance; and inclusive development.\r\nMy country has identified five pillars that we believe \r\nwill address our own specific development challenges. \r\nThese pillars represent the areas where progress is most \r\nneeded to build a rights-based, equitable and sustainable \r\nsociety. These pillars are poverty reduction and social \r\ninclusion; environmental sustainability, climate change \r\nand disaster risk management; accountable, responsive \r\nand participatory governance; a fair and stable order \r\nbased on the international rule of law; and peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nMy Government will formulate and implement \r\npolicies that will be defined by these pillars. These \r\nThese glowing reports are, of course, well received \r\nby my Government, but we are under no illusion that \r\nthese indicators alone constitute success. For the past \r\n13 years, the MDGs have been integrated into the \r\nPhilippine development plan for 2011-2016. Yet our \r\nwork continues and the challenge we now face is clear. \r\nIt is how to ensure that growth is inclusive, resilient and \r\nsustainable. As we pursue the path towards this very type \r\nof growth, my Government is guided by the following \r\nimportant lessons learned from our experience in \r\nworking towards the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nFirst, strong institutional arrangements are \r\nnecessary. For the Philippines, that means that the \r\nhighest political support is given to the attainment of \r\nthe MDGs, involving all branches of Government and \r\nother key stakeholders.\r\nSecondly, specific policies, programmes and \r\nprojects must be aligned with national development \r\ngoals. In our MDG experience, innovative social \r\nprotection programmes include conditional cash \r\ntransfers, universal health care, the comprehensive \r\nand integrated delivery of social services, a K-12 basic \r\neducation programme, and a community mortgage \r\nprogramme.\r\nThirdly, the active participation of various \r\nstakeholders — namely, the private sector, civil society, \r\nnon-governmental organizations, the constituents and \r\ninternational development partners — must be strongly \r\npromoted and supported. This ensures that policies and \r\nprogrammes are responsive and inclusive.\r\nFourthly, local Government units should be \r\nempowered. Beyond the delivery of basic social \r\nservices, the capacities of local Government units in \r\nformulating and implementing policies and programmes \r\nmust be strengthened and guided by the principles of \r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\nFifthly, the capability to generate accurate, timely \r\nand relevant data at the national and local levels must \r\nbe enhanced.\r\nSixthly, disaster risk reduction must be \r\nmainstreamed to enable communities to better cushion \r\nthe impact of man-made and natural disasters. Building \r\nthe capacities of national and local stakeholders to help \r\nreduce the vulnerability and increase the physical and \r\neconomic resilience of communities must be a key \r\ndevelopment goal.\r\n13-48953 7/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nthese migrants, with a view to forging creative platforms \r\non which States — whether countries of origin, transit \r\nor destination — can cooperate to better address this \r\ncomplex issue.\r\nThe Philippines hopes that the High-level Dialogue \r\nwill reaffirm that migration is an indispensable \r\nelement in the global sustainable development agenda. \r\nMigration influences each country’s socioeconomic \r\ngrowth, human capital and involvement in global \r\naffairs. Managing migration through policies that \r\nuphold the dignity of the individual should therefore be \r\na vital component in the development agenda of each \r\nnation and of the world.\r\nAchieving sustainable development requires \r\nan enabling environment of peace, security and the \r\nrule of law. It is to this end that my Government’s \r\napproach in managing conflicts within and outside \r\nits borders is anchored in international law. As such, \r\nwe avail ourselves of the various means for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, including mediation \r\nand arbitration, in accordance with Chapter VI of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter.\r\nAs declared by the General Assembly in its \r\nresolution 37/10, on the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes, otherwise known as the 1982 \r\nManila Declaration, recourse to the judicial settlement \r\nof legal disputes should not be considered an unfriendly \r\nact between States. On the contrary, it is a measure that \r\ngenerates clarity, benefiting all stakeholders. In this \r\nspirit, my country reaffirms its unwavering support \r\nfor the International Court of Justice and the various \r\nspecialized tribunals, such as the dispute settlement \r\nmechanisms of the World Trade Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nThe Philippines has also relentlessly and tirelessly \r\npursued the peace process in the southern Philippines. \r\nThe signing of the Framework Agreement on the \r\nBangsamoro was a milestone in this regard. We remain \r\nsteadfastly committed to achieving just and lasting \r\npeace that will be inclusive for all.\r\nFurthermore, in accordance with the application of \r\nthe rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nthe Philippines, as a State party to the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention and a staunch advocate of \r\ndisarmament and the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, also welcomes Syria’s accession to \r\nthe Treaty. The Philippines hopes that the Organization \r\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons will \r\npolicies will duly be integrated into my country’s \r\nnational development agenda, and progress will be \r\nmonitored at regular intervals. On the global front, the \r\nPhilippines proposes that the duration of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda should be 10 years, with a major \r\nreview to be undertaken by 2020. Reforms should be \r\nfront-loaded within the first half of the period to pave \r\nthe way for substantive accomplishments by 2020.\r\nAllow me to further elaborate on aspects of the \r\nprinciples and themes the Philippines has put forward. \r\nThe Philippines continues to aspire to a global \r\neconomic system that places development at the centre \r\nand promotes democracy in international economic \r\ndecision-making. Ultimately, it behoves us to consider \r\nreform of the overall global economic system as we \r\ncraft a sound, sustainable development agenda.\r\nTo achieve meaningful reform, what we need now \r\nis a strong political impetus from all of us to make \r\nthis happen. Governments must see beyond political \r\ndifferences and agree to work together to ensure a \r\nlevel global playing field. It is for this reason that the \r\nPhilippines staunchly supports the High-level Political \r\nForum on sustainable development goals.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda should squarely \r\naddress migration. It is a cross-cutting issue relevant \r\nto our efforts to promote human rights, reduce poverty \r\nand foster sustainable development. The Philippines, \r\nfor its part, will continue to advocate the protection of \r\nthe rights of migrants, regardless of migration status; \r\nthe recognition of migrants’ positive contribution to \r\ndevelopment in the sending and receiving countries \r\nalike; and the creation of programmes that support \r\nfamilies, especially the children who are left behind.\r\nOur national experience of these issues will be \r\nmy Government’s contribution to the discussion in \r\nthe forthcoming High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development later this week. In \r\naddition, we hope to include in the discussion the plight \r\nof migrants who find themselves in conflict areas — a \r\nsituation that my Government has had to address in \r\nrecent years. In several instances, we have repatriated \r\nFilipino workers to get them out of harm’s way.\r\nOur experience has been instructive and enriching, \r\nas it has opened for us new windows of cooperation \r\nwith our bilateral partners, as well as with the United \r\nNations, the International Organization for Migration \r\nand other international organizations. My Government \r\nwants to focus international discussion on the plight of \r\n8/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Her \r\nExcellency Maxine McClean, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMs. McClean (Barbados): It is my distinct honour \r\nand pleasure to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. The Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) Heads of Government, at their thirty-\r\nfourth meeting in July, pledged their support for your \r\npresidency. Allow me therefore to assure you of my \r\ndelegation’s support throughout the current session \r\nof the General Assembly. Let me also commend your \r\npredecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for ably guiding the \r\nwork of the General Assembly during its sixty-seventh \r\nsession.\r\nYou have assumed leadership of the General \r\nAssembly at a very pivotal moment in the United Nations \r\ntimetable. The expiration deadline for the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals is near, and our efforts to elaborate \r\nan agenda for the post-2015 period are intensifying. \r\nFollowing the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, modifications have been made to the \r\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development. \r\nAn agreement has been reached on the establishment \r\nof the High-level Political Forum and the United \r\nNations Environment Assembly. The deliberations on \r\nthe reform of the Economic and Social Council have \r\nbeen completed. It is envisaged that the deliberations of \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and the intergovernmental committee of experts \r\non sustainable development financing will accelerate \r\nin the next few months. The international community \r\ncontinues to chart a course in the pursuit of global \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe theme of the sixty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage”, will require us to engage in what might best \r\nbe described as a retrospective and prospective dialogue. \r\nMuch has been said about the current global financial \r\nand economic crisis, which has been made worse by \r\nthe many manifestations of the impact of climate \r\nchange — extreme weather events, food crises and \r\nvolatile food crises — compounded by unprecedented \r\nlevels of terror and violence. At the same time, we have \r\nseen a global determination to tackle these issues.\r\nBarbados recognizes that the stability, health and \r\nproductivity of the global environment, particularly \r\ncoastal and marine resources, are fundamental to the \r\neffectively assist the Syrian Government in disposing \r\nof its chemical weapons stockpiles.\r\nThe Philippine Government’s commitment to \r\npeace is resolute. This commitment is demonstrated \r\nin its continued participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, particularly in the United \r\nNations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in \r\nthe occupied Golan where, despite the dangers, our \r\npeacekeepers have stood their ground. Their courage to \r\nstay and hold the line at the most critical time led to the \r\ncontinued fulfilment of UNDOF’s mandate as charged \r\nby the Security Council.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda also demands \r\nthat Governments address the devastating effects of \r\nclimate change and natural disasters. My country \r\nis among those at highest risk from typhoons, \r\nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis. In terms \r\nof disaster management, my Government has instituted \r\na cluster model that mobilizes both Government and \r\nnon-governmental entities at the local and national \r\nlevels, as well as international partners. The United \r\nNations has recognized this model as a best practice \r\nthat other countries could emulate. We will continue \r\nto share our knowledge and experience in disaster-\r\nrisk reduction, preparedness, response and recovery to \r\nhelp other States better manage similar occurrences. \r\nIn 2015, we will also actively participate in the World \r\nHumanitarian Summit and in the review of the Hyogo \r\nFramework for Action, our blueprint for disaster risk \r\nreduction cooperation.\r\nThe year 2015 marks an important juncture in the \r\nhistory of nations. It will mark the beginning of a new \r\nera of sustainable development, one, it is hoped, that \r\ngives every individual on this planet a better chance \r\nat a better quality of life. That may sound ambitious; \r\nit may even sound daunting. Yet, this is an historic \r\ntime and historic times call for acts of great ambition. \r\nOur national hero, Mr. José Rizal, also recognized the \r\nimportance of ambition and ideals. He wrote that\r\n“it is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great \r\nideal. It is like a stone wasted on the field without \r\nbecoming a part of any edifice”.\r\nLet the post-2015 development agenda be the edifice \r\nupon which we will manifest the collective dreams and \r\nideals of humankind.\r\n13-48953 9/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nwithin the established international norms that have \r\nguided this sector to date.\r\nIn 1994, Barbados was honoured to host the first \r\nUnited Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States. At \r\nthat time, we were optimistic that the international \r\ncommunity’s recognition of the inherent vulnerabilities \r\nof small States would lead to real progress in the \r\ndevelopment of SIDS. However, the five-year review of \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy in 2010 revealed that\r\n“[s]mall island developing States have made \r\nless progress than most other groupings, or even \r\nregressed, in economic terms, especially in terms \r\nof poverty reduction and debt sustainability” \r\n(resolution 65/2, para. 5).\r\nDespite this, Barbados remains committed to the \r\nprocess to advance the sustainable development of \r\nSIDS.\r\nAs you are aware, Mr. President, Barbados attaches \r\ngreat importance to sustainable development in all its \r\ndimensions. We believe that the theme for this year’s \r\nsession — “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage” — is thus both timely and important. Such \r\nan agenda must recognize the importance of addressing \r\nthe very specific needs of the Members of the United \r\nNations. I speak therefore from the perspective of SIDS.\r\nBarbados believes that the post-2015 development \r\nagenda should involve commitments to the eradication \r\nof poverty and hunger; environmental sustainability, \r\nwith a strong emphasis on coastal and marine resources; \r\nthe development of sustainable and accessible renewable \r\nenergy technologies; the pursuit of a sustainable \r\nagriculture agenda, in tandem with food and nutrition \r\nsecurity; gender equality and women’s empowerment; \r\nand youth development, education and employment.\r\nWe also call for emphasis on the inclusion of \r\nvulnerable groups, including persons with disabilities; \r\nthe requisite means of implementation, including \r\ncapacity-building, technology transfer, trade and \r\ntechnical cooperation; the integration of appropriate \r\nsystems for accountability, monitoring, evaluation and \r\nreporting; and good governance, respect for human \r\nrights, and the rule of law.\r\nThis is not a mere shopping list. It ref lects the \r\nunderstanding that all these issues are inextricably \r\nlinked. They represent challenges or problems that \r\nmust be tackled simultaneously, if we are to achieve \r\nsurvival of Barbados, CARICOM and other small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS). We therefore deem \r\nit imperative that countries like ours maintain active \r\ninvolvement in shaping the global development \r\npolicy agenda. It is recognized, however, that SIDS \r\nare constrained in their ability and capacity to craft \r\nindependent solutions. One major barrier is our debt \r\nsituation.\r\nThe issue of debt sustainability is of particular \r\nrelevance to SIDS. In highlighting its importance, the \r\nPrime Minister of Barbados, in his feature address \r\nto the recently concluded interregional preparatory \r\nmeeting for the Third International Conference on the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates, noted:\r\n“Debt sustainability is a critical issue not only \r\nfor Barbados, but for many of the SIDS... We must \r\ntherefore use the opportunity provided by the \r\nThird International Conference on SIDS to both \r\nfind and share solutions to this challenge, as it is \r\na major constraint to SIDS achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\n“In this context, it is imperative that, before \r\nwe meet in Samoa, an opportunity be provided \r\nto fully ventilate this matter. In this regard, the \r\nrelevant entity of the United Nations responsible \r\nfor coordinating SIDS issues may want to consider \r\nconvening a meeting of the Finance and Economic \r\nMinisters of SIDS to discuss this issue and to put \r\nforward specific recommendations to be considered \r\nas part of the outcome of the Third International \r\nmeeting on SIDS.”\r\nI repeat that call on this body and commend it to the \r\nrelevant entity of the United Nations system to act \r\nexpeditiously on this proposal.\r\nAnother issue of concern to Barbados relates to the \r\ninternational financial-services sector. We believe that \r\nthe sustainability of our development is being stymied \r\nby efforts to undermine this very important sector, \r\nwhich continues to provide a stable and substantial \r\ncontribution to our gross domestic product. Barbados \r\ntherefore associates itself with the comments of the \r\nRight Honourable Perry Christie, Prime Minister of the \r\nBahamas, in his address to the General Assembly (see \r\nA/68/PV.19). We are a well-regulated jurisdiction which \r\nhas sought at all times to comply with international \r\nrules and best practice, and it is our intention to operate \r\n10/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nof Barbados referred to this recently as building SIDS \r\ncollectivity.\r\nThe support of the international community \r\nmust underpin this concept of SIDS collectivity \r\nby strengthening interregional and intraregional \r\ncollaboration between SIDS and the various \r\nSIDS regions, and increasing emphasis on \r\ninstitution-building, including the establishment of an \r\nappropriate institutional mechanism to facilitate, in \r\nparticular, intraregional collaboration among SIDS.\r\nCredence is given to this approach by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-level Panel on Global Sustainability, \r\nwhose report (see A/66/700) stressed that the building \r\nof effective institutional governance at the local, \r\nnational, regional and global levels is essential for \r\nachieving sustainable development, facilitating greater \r\nutilization of science and technology to help address \r\nmany of the issues being faced by our young people \r\nin strengthening the interface between youth talent, \r\ninnovation and entrepreneurship, and speaking with \r\none voice at the international level on issues impacting \r\nSIDS sustainable development.\r\nBarbados believes firmly that South-South and \r\ntriangular cooperation must be part of any effort \r\nto reform the existing international development \r\ncooperation architecture and to build more inclusive \r\nglobal partnerships for effective development \r\ncooperation. We possess a wealth of experience in areas \r\nthat we can share with developing and middle-income \r\ncountries, including education and training, health \r\ncare, social partnering, clean -nergy policies and \r\ntechnologies, environmental protection, including \r\ncoastal conservation, and the provision of social safety \r\nnets.\r\nLike other SIDS, however, we are constrained \r\nby limited financial resources and the persistent and \r\nprolonged global financial crisis, which continue to \r\nhave a negative impact on resource mobilization and \r\nfinancial f lows to developing countries. Barbados \r\nsupports the observation made by the United Nations \r\nOffice for South-South Cooperation, that there is a need \r\nto give the global South the incentive to invest more \r\nin multilateral forms of South-South cooperation. We \r\ntherefore welcome the formation of partnerships with \r\nthe private sector, international organizations, donors \r\nand civil society organizations specifically designed to \r\nbetter facilitate such South-South cooperation.\r\nsustainable development. These cannot be addressed in \r\na silo-like manner.\r\nThe importance of a policy of sustainable \r\ndevelopment can therefore not be understated. It \r\nis a matter of survival. It is for this reason that the \r\nGovernment of Barbados has envisioned the building \r\nof a green economy as its strategy for advancing its \r\nsustainable development. As Prime Minister Freundel \r\nStuart indicated in the foreword to the Green Economy: \r\nScoping Study Synthesis Report on Barbados,\r\n“the Green Economy debate recognizes our \r\nstructural vulnerabilities, offers a model to assist \r\nus in further realizing our sustainable development \r\naspirations, and creates the institutional platform \r\nthat would enable us to participate in innovative \r\npartnerships in the fight to save our planet, \r\nagainst mounting unsustainable consumption and \r\nproduction patterns”.\r\nOur situation as a special case for development \r\nholds as true today as it did more than 20 years ago, \r\nwhen the United Nations system first acknowledged \r\nour vulnerabilities and our special link to ocean \r\nresources. In the case of Barbados, we are of the \r\nopinion that a green economy is inextricably linked to \r\nour development and as such should not be lost in this \r\nvery important discussion.\r\nOver the past several months, increasing attention \r\nhas been focused on the preparatory process for the \r\nThird International Conference on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of SIDS, to be held in Samoa in 2014. \r\nThree regional preparatory meetings in the various \r\nSIDS regions were convened in July. Members may \r\nrecall that the interregional meeting was held in my \r\ncountry, Barbados, the birthplace of the Programme \r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland Developing States — the Barbados Programme \r\nof Action.\r\nBarbados attaches great importance to the \r\npreparatory process for the Samoa Conference. As we \r\ntake stock after almost 20 years of the implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action and 10 years of the \r\nMauritius Strategy for its further implementation, \r\nwe wish to emphasize that this process is an integral \r\npart of the overall post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThis preparatory process can strengthen the collective \r\naction of SIDS in addressing their vulnerabilities and \r\nspecial development challenges. Prime Minister Stuart \r\n13-48953 11/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nOur strong commitment to preventing and combating \r\nchronic non-communicable diseases is reflected in \r\nstrong multi-stakeholder partnerships, including the \r\ndedicated engagement of civil society. Despite the \r\nnational prioritization of non-communicable diseases, \r\nthe focus on prevention, and the implementation of \r\nevidence-based programmes, a developing country \r\nlike Barbados cannot, on its own, achieve its national \r\nobjectives. International cooperation and assistance in \r\nthis area are critical.\r\nMy country does not draw a dividing line between \r\nits domestic and foreign policies. We have been blessed \r\nwith stable Governments. We have enjoyed a tradition \r\nof constitutional change in our Governments since \r\nindependence. As a nation, we have striven to create \r\na just society. We see an inextricable link between \r\ndevelopment and international peace and security. \r\nWithout development, there can be no international \r\npeace and security, and without international peace and \r\nsecurity the development agenda will not succeed.\r\nFor Barbados, therefore, the rule of law at the \r\nnational and international levels is an indispensable \r\ncondition for sustainable development. Barbados is \r\ndeeply concerned by the number of national regional \r\nand international conflicts raging throughout the \r\nworld. We are yet more concerned that the threshold \r\nof what constitutes an acceptable level of violence and \r\nacceptable levels of atrocity grows higher and higher. \r\nThe findings of the United Nations inspection team that \r\nchemical weapons were used in Syria are alarming. My \r\ncountry believes that the perpetrators of these acts must \r\nbe brought to account. Moreover, we believe that the \r\ninternational community must work in good faith to \r\nfind a political solution to the escalating and ongoing \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Syria.\r\nAt the same time, the international community \r\nmust not lose sight of the many conflicts and acts of \r\nterror that continue throughout the world. Against this \r\nbackground my delegation wishes to extend profound \r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of Kenya \r\non the recent terrorist attacks that were perpetrated \r\nagainst the people of that country. As we have stated, \r\nthere can be no justification for acts of terror.\r\nIn Barbados and the Caribbean, illicit small arms \r\nand light weapons are the weapons of mass destruction. \r\nPrimarily linked to international drug trafficking and \r\nother transnational organized crime, the proliferation \r\nof illicit small arms and light weapons in the Caribbean \r\nThere is a clear need for greater equity, fairness \r\nand transparency in the method employed to \r\ndetermine socioeconomic classifications and resource \r\nallocation. The persistent use of arbitrarily determined \r\ninternational classification and ratings systems that are \r\nbased on gross domestic product per capita and other \r\nnarrow criteria must be expanded in scope to take into \r\naccount meaningful variables such as vulnerability.\r\nIn this context, we refer again to the observation \r\nby the Secretary-General that gross domestic product \r\nper capita on its own is an inadequate indicator. We \r\nalso applaud the useful research being conducted on \r\nvulnerability indices and other measures beyond gross \r\ndomestic product by bodies such as the Commonwealth, \r\nthe Economic Commission for Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean, and the United Nations Statistical \r\nCommission. Barbados will continue its advocacy on \r\nthis issue.\r\nBarbados is not unique. Like other SIDS, we \r\nrecognize that our efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment must of necessity incorporate delivery \r\nmodalities encompassing finance, good governance, \r\ndevelopment cooperation, trade capacity-building and \r\ninstitutional strengthening. Barbados therefore reminds \r\nthis body that we must foster strong partnerships if we \r\nare to craft effective and truly lasting global solutions.\r\nWe call on Member States to revisit the Small Island \r\nDeveloping States Technical Assistance Programme as \r\na means of enabling the transfer of skills, knowledge \r\nand experience across SIDS and the three SIDS \r\nregions. We hold the view that the Programme offers \r\nmuch potential for enhancing capacity and access to \r\nSIDS-grown technologies and skill sets. The Technical \r\nAssistance Programme must be seen as an important \r\nmechanism for advancing the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nThe provision of free health care for Barbadian \r\ncitizens has been a critical contributor to the high level \r\nof human development in Barbados. The treatment and \r\nprevention of chronic non-communicable diseases, \r\nhowever, account for a disproportionately large \r\npercentage of our national budget. That has entailed \r\nthe diversion of scarce resources that should have been \r\ndevoted to achieving other development goals. Chronic \r\nnon-communicable diseases constitute one of the major \r\nchallenges to the sustainable development of Barbados, \r\neffectively threatening the development gains that \r\nBarbados has made.\r\n12/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. I assure you of the full \r\nsupport and cooperation of the Myanmar delegation. \r\nI am confident that your diplomatic skills and vast \r\nknowledge will guide our deliberations to a successful \r\nconclusion. I should also like to pay special tribute to \r\nyour predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for a job well done \r\nin guiding the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are fast approaching the deadline for the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. With fewer than \r\n850 days to go, there is now a sense of urgency to look \r\nback on our past journey and chart the way forward. \r\nDespite the laudable advances made in meeting several \r\nof the global Millennium Development Goal (MDG) \r\ntargets in the past 13 years, there remain inequality and \r\nvariations in achievement across regions and within \r\ncountries. Therefore, we need to intensify our efforts \r\nand accelerate actions towards the full realization of \r\nthe MDGs in the remaining short span of time.\r\nIn many developing countries, especially the least \r\ndeveloped ones, a large proportion of the population \r\nis still grappling with poverty, hunger, economic and \r\nsocial disparity, and environmental degradation. It \r\nis therefore most pertinent and timely for the United \r\nNations to set the post-2015 development agenda. For \r\nits part, Myanmar has been exerting relentless efforts to \r\nraise the socioeconomic conditions of its people, with \r\npoverty alleviation as the core priority of the national \r\neconomic strategy, commensurate with the MDGs.\r\nMy delegation adds its voice to that of the Group \r\nof 77 in calls to address the key implementation gaps \r\nof the MDGs and the poverty agenda over the next \r\ntwo years. In this regard, national efforts should be \r\nassisted by international support and an enabling \r\nenvironment. The role of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment must also be strengthened. Achieving \r\ninclusive and sustainable development will be one of \r\nthe most paramount challenges of this century for the \r\nUnited Nations. Therefore my delegation welcomes the \r\nestablishment by the General Assembly of the High-\r\nLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development.\r\nThis year, Myanmar celebrates the sixty-fourth \r\nanniversary of its membership in the family of the \r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the United Nations \r\nsystem remains relevant and important in the current \r\ninternational situation. In this age fraught with global \r\nchallenges, the United Nations is more essential than \r\nexacts a heavy toll on State and citizen security and \r\nimpairs national development. For that reason, Barbados \r\nand CARICOM consistently argued for the elaboration \r\nof a robust, legally binding Arms Trade Treaty, which \r\nwould set the highest common international standards \r\nfor regulating the transfer of conventional arms. \r\nBarbados is pleased, therefore, to be among those \r\nMember States that have signed the Arms Trade Treaty. \r\nIt is our hope that the implementation of the Treaty will \r\nlead to a reduction in the f low of illicit small arms, light \r\nweapons and their ammunition, parts and components, \r\nthus contributing to a reduction in armed conflict and \r\nviolence.\r\nOur first Prime Minister, now a national hero, the \r\nRight Excellent Errol Walton Barrow, in his maiden \r\nspeech to this body on 9 December 1966, stated:\r\n“We have no quarrels to pursue and we \r\nparticularly insist that we do not regard any \r\nMember State as our natural opponent... We will \r\nnot regard any great Power as necessarily right in a \r\ngiven dispute unless we are convinced of this, yet \r\nat the same time, we will not view the great Powers \r\nwith perennial suspicion.” (A/PV.1487, para. 78)\r\nThe United Nations was established in the aftermath \r\nof the Second World War to promote international \r\npeace and security. We call on the Security Council \r\nto meet its obligations to the international community. \r\nIt is clear that there cannot be business as usual while \r\nhumanitarian crises continue to emerge and countless \r\nlives continue to be lost. My delegation therefore \r\nremains concerned about the economic embargo \r\nthat continues to be imposed on Cuba, as well as the \r\nextraterritorial impact that it continues to have on \r\ncountries inside and outside our region. We call for the \r\nending of the embargo and trust that it will soon be \r\nushered into the pages of history.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to the further \r\nunfolding of the post-2015 development agenda during \r\nthis sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly, and \r\nI wish you, Sir, every success as you guide the General \r\nAssembly in realizing an agenda that is inclusive and \r\none that will redound to the benefit of all.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Wunna Maung Lwin, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Lwin (Myanmar): At the outset, I should like \r\nto extend my sincere congratulations to you, Sir, on \r\n13-48953 13/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nThe first component of the reform was political \r\ntransformation. The objective was to bring about \r\npeace, stability, national unity and reconciliation. Now \r\nwe have been able to establish a firm foundation for \r\nbuilding a democratic society. Political space has been \r\ncreated for every stakeholder, and the all-inclusive \r\npolitical system is in place. The legislative bodies are \r\nalso functioning well, in an active and vibrant manner. \r\nNumerous pieces of legislation have been enacted to the \r\nbenefit of the people, including new laws permitting \r\ngreater freedom of the press, speech and association. A \r\nseries of amnesties have been granted which have set \r\nfree thousands of prisoners. We are speedily working \r\nthrough a screening mechanism to ensure that no \r\nprisoner of conscience will remain in prison by the end \r\nof the year.\r\nThe emergence of civil societies has also contributed \r\nto strengthening democratic values and practices. We \r\nhave now been able to nurture a new culture of dialogue \r\nand accommodation among people of differing views \r\nand beliefs. We are also taking steps to establish the \r\nrule of law, good governance and clean government.\r\nWe have also made tangible progress in our efforts \r\ntowards national reconciliation. The Government’s \r\npeace overtures have led to ceasefire agreements with \r\nall armed groups, for the first time in more than 60 years. \r\nWe hope that we will be able to celebrate the signing of \r\na nationwide ceasefire agreement in Nay Pyi Taw very \r\nsoon. We are optimistic that we will be able to start \r\na new round of political dialogue at the Union central \r\nlevel in the near future to strike a comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace agreement. We have no illusion that the \r\nnext step will be easy, but we are determined to pursue \r\nthis path for the sake of our people, as they have for so \r\nlong deserved.\r\nThe hard-won peace and the success of the \r\ndemocratic transformation will not be realistic or \r\nsustainable until and unless we deliver on the economic \r\nand social needs of the people. Therefore, as the \r\nsecond component of reform, we have opened up the \r\neconomy through economic liberalization, financial \r\nreform, inviting foreign investment, a people-centred \r\ndevelopment approach, rural development, poverty \r\nalleviation and equitable development. We have \r\nalso created an investor-friendly environment. The \r\nGovernment is focusing on poverty alleviation and rural \r\ndevelopment. We have aimed at reducing the current \r\npoverty rate from 26 per cent to 16 per cent by 2015, as \r\nprescribed in the Millennium Development Goals.\r\never. We have trust in the world body’s capacity and \r\ncapability to maintain international peace and security, \r\nto safeguard fundamental human rights, and to promote \r\neconomic and social development. Therefore, Myanmar \r\nhas always cooperated with the United Nations in good \r\nfaith.\r\nAs cooperation with the United Nations is the \r\ncornerstone of our foreign policy, we have always \r\nstrictly abided by the decisions and resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the United Nations \r\nshould be more democratic, representative and effective \r\nin order to face the security and economic challenges in \r\nmany parts of the world.\r\nThe continued existence of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, particularly nuclear weapons, poses the \r\ngreatest threat to humankind. Myanmar is therefore \r\nactively pursuing the cause of nuclear disarmament \r\nand nuclear non-proliferation in international forums. \r\nOne testimony of our aspiration is demonstrated by \r\nthe annual resolution on nuclear disarmament that \r\nour delegation has submitted since 1995. Through \r\nthat resolution we have been calling on nuclear-\r\nweapon States to cease immediately the qualitative \r\nimprovement, development, production and stockpiling \r\nof nuclear weapons with a view to taking measures \r\nleading to their total elimination within a specified \r\nframework of time.\r\nIn that firm belief, the Government of Myanmar \r\nsigned the additional protocol to the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency safeguards agreement on the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\non 17 September. That is yet another significant \r\ndevelopment testifying to our commitment to the goals \r\nof nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation.\r\nMyanmar fully subscribes to the fundamental \r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAccordingly, Myanmar has been contributing its fair \r\nshare to regional and international peace and security.\r\nOn the domestic front, the Government of \r\nPresident U Thein Sein has been undertaking \r\nunprecedented wide-ranging political and economic \r\nreforms over the past two and a half years. The \r\nGovernment has dedicated its efforts to fulfilling the \r\ntwin objectives inspired by the people: to establish \r\npeace, stability and the rule of law, and to advance \r\nsocioeconomic development of the lives of the people.\r\n14/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nrights bodies for the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights in the country.\r\nOur reform process is still nascent and at a \r\nsensitive stage where there is little room for error. With \r\nthis in mind, the President has publicly emphasized \r\nthe need for everyone to refrain from doing anything \r\nthat could jeopardize Myanmar’s peaceful transition. \r\nWhile undertaking political and other reform processes \r\ndomestically, we have also been able to reach out to the \r\ninternational community. The overwhelming support \r\nthat we have received from the international community \r\nand the United Nations has contributed significantly to \r\nthe transition efforts in the country.\r\nMyanmar is ready to take over the chairmanship of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nin 2014 for the very first time since the country joined \r\nthe Organization in 1997. We regard this opportunity \r\nas a great honour. We shall be working closely with our \r\nfellow ASEAN members and with ASEAN dialogue \r\npartners in discharging this important responsibility so \r\nas to move forward in unity to a peaceful and prosperous \r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the process of Myanmar’s transition to \r\ndemocracy, expectations are high within the country \r\nas well as in the international community. For the \r\nGovernment and the people of Myanmar, the task is \r\ndaunting. There are many challenges ahead. We are still \r\nin a critical transition period. However, we are resolute \r\nin marching forward along our chosen path. There will \r\nbe no turning back. But we will not take anything for \r\ngranted. It is incumbent upon the Government and \r\npeople of Myanmar to be vigilant at all times so that we \r\ndo not fall into the trap of the detractors of the reform \r\nprocess.\r\nWe need the continued support and encouragement \r\nof the international community. We always welcome \r\nfriendly and constructive advice and the helping \r\nhands of friends far and near in our nation-building \r\nprocess. However, we are fully cognizant of the fact \r\nthat ultimately the people Myanmar themselves are \r\nresponsible for deciding their own destiny and shaping \r\ntheir own future.\r\nThe Government of President U Thein Sein is \r\nlaying a solid foundation for democracy, peace and \r\ndevelopment for the people of Myanmar. Observers \r\nhave applauded Myanmar’s transition to democracy as \r\none of the most promising efforts of democratization in \r\nthe world today. The success we have achieved so far on \r\nRecently, the Government turned its focus to \r\nprivate-sector development as another wave of reform. \r\nAt this stage, the Government is strongly emphasizing \r\nthe improvement of the institutional infrastructure and \r\nregulatory framework so as to facilitate business, trade \r\nand investment.\r\nWe are truly grateful to the international community \r\nfor its invaluable support and encouragement in our \r\ndemocratic transition as well as in our efforts for the \r\nsocioeconomic development of the people of Myanmar. \r\nWe welcome responsible trade and investment that will \r\ntransfer technology to develop our economy, to create \r\njobs and to lift our people from poverty. We are now \r\ntaking the necessary steps to become a signatory to the \r\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We will \r\ntry our best to ensure that no one from the communities \r\nor our national ethnic groups will be left behind and \r\nexcluded from enjoying the fruits of our reforms and \r\nthe exciting life of the nation.\r\nMyanmar is a multiracial and multifaith nation. \r\nVarious ethnic populations with the world’s four \r\ngreat religions — Buddhists, Christians, Muslims \r\nand Hindus — have been living side by side in peace \r\nand harmony as fellow citizens of Myanmar. The \r\nConstitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar \r\nalso designates the four religions as officially recognized \r\nfaiths of the country. There are always people who wish \r\nto rock the boat. We will not let anyone take advantage \r\nof political openness to instigate violence among the \r\ndifferent ethnic or religious communities. President \r\nU Thein Sein has clearly stated that the Government \r\nwill take a zero-tolerance approach to anyone fuelling \r\nethnic hatred.\r\nThe Government has been making serious \r\nefforts to resolve the problem through short-term \r\nand long-term plans. These include our extensive \r\nefforts, in cooperation with the United Nations and \r\nhumanitarian non-governmental organizations, to \r\nimprove the living conditions and livelihoods of all \r\naffected peoples, without discrimination. Parallel with \r\nthese efforts, the Government is also encouraging \r\ninterfaith dialogues across the country with a view to \r\npromoting understanding and trust among the different \r\ncommunities. In addition, the National Human \r\nRights Commission, an independent human rights \r\nbody of Myanmar, has also been working closely and \r\nintensively with domestic civil society organizations, \r\ninterfaith groups and regional and international human \r\n13-48953 15/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\ncount on the support of our friends and the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nWe meet at a time of extraordinary changes. While \r\nsome have been able to achieve tremendous economic \r\ngrowth and prosperity, millions of people continue \r\nto languish in the inhuman depths of poverty. Our \r\nrelentless drive for economic growth has come at the \r\ncost of our environment. The climate is changing. \r\nNatural disasters hit us with increasing frequency \r\nand intensity. The natural question then is, how do we \r\nadvance economic growth, promote societal progress \r\nand prosperity within the confines of nature? How do \r\nwe lift the millions of people out of the vicious circle of \r\npoverty? How can we ensure that we leave a planet safe \r\nand secure for our children and grandchildren?\r\nThese, I believe, are the key questions that confront \r\nus all. Although we come from different parts of the \r\nglobe, with our unique historical backgrounds and \r\ncultural experiences, we are bound by our shared future. \r\nIn today’s interconnected and globalized world, we \r\ncan prevail only if we come together as global citizens \r\nand work to find solutions for the sake of our common \r\nfuture. In this endeavour, Mr. President, as you have \r\nrightly stated, failure is not an option.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the theme “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage” for this general \r\ndebate. The question of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda is important, especially for the least developed \r\nand landlocked countries, which in many respects have \r\nthe most at stake. It presents the opportunity for all \r\ncountries to share their experiences and the kind of \r\ndevelopment agenda that they would like to see in the \r\npost-2015 era.\r\nAs we set the stage for a development agenda \r\nbeyond 2015, the Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n52/2) provides a strong foundation. In our search for \r\na new development agenda we must not forget the \r\nimportant principles set out in the Declaration, but must \r\nemphasize their continued relevance. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) inspired nations and a \r\nwhole generation to improve the lives of many people by \r\ncreating synergies between nations and among people. \r\nAll efforts must be made to accelerate the realization of \r\nthe MDGs during their last mile.\r\nThe outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n66/288, annex) also outlined important principles on \r\nwhich the post-2015 development agenda should be \r\nthe road to democracy has been made possible through \r\nthe joint efforts of the leadership and the people of \r\nMyanmar, driven by a strong and genuine desire to \r\nchange.\r\nThe road ahead is long and full of challenges. We \r\nwill spare no effort to overcome any challenges and \r\nmove ahead on the journey on which we have set out to \r\nbuild a nation of peace, democracy and prosperity. As \r\nwe continue our journey we need the understanding, \r\ncontinued encouragement and support of the United \r\nNations and the international community. We will \r\nnever lose sight of our goals, and we are determined to \r\nfulfil the aspirations of the people of Myanmar.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Lyonpo Rinzin Dorje, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Dorje (Bhutan): I bring to you, Mr. President, \r\nand through you to all representatives the warm \r\ngreetings and good wishes of His Majesty Jigme Khesar \r\nNamgyel Wangchuck. Allow me also to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I assure \r\nyou of my delegation’s full support and cooperation as \r\nyou steer the important work of this session.\r\nI am deeply honoured to have the opportunity to \r\naddress the Assembly for the first time. I do so owing \r\nto the mandate accorded by the people of Bhutan to the \r\nPeople’s Democratic Party at the second parliamentary \r\nelections held this summer.\r\nThe second parliamentary elections were yet \r\nanother milestone on the path of democracy that Bhutan \r\nchose to undertake five years ago. In 2008 there were \r\ntwo political parties, whereas four parties contested this \r\nyear’s elections. The people of Bhutan voted for change \r\nand ushered in a new Government. These, I believe, \r\nare signs of a vibrant democracy enabling the people \r\nof Bhutan to exercise their will through the ballot box.\r\nWe know that democracy needs to go beyond \r\nelections. We will therefore continually work to \r\nstrengthen democratic institutions, the rule of law, an \r\nindependent judiciary, a vibrant civil society, an open \r\nand free media and, above all, a democratic culture that \r\nenables people to voice their aspirations and to live \r\nwith dignity, equality and prosperity. As we embark \r\non a new phase in our relatively young democracy, we \r\ndo so in full confidence that democracy in Bhutan is \r\nirreversible and on a firm footing. In this journey, we \r\n16/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\n20 March as the International Day of Happiness, at its \r\nsixty-sixth session.\r\nHappiness as a development policy must relate to \r\nindividuals as well as to Governments. It is the sacred \r\nresponsibility of Governments to ensure that conditions \r\nare created for its citizens to pursue their individual \r\nhappiness within the larger aspirations of the country. \r\nAll our achievements, including the peaceful transition \r\nto a democracy in 2008, as well as the progress realized \r\nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals, have \r\nbeen as a result of embarking on a people-centred \r\ndevelopment approach.\r\nEncouraged by our positive national experience, \r\nBhutan has facilitated efforts to elaborate a holistic \r\napproach to development. We intend to share the \r\nfindings with Member States and the wider international \r\ncommunity at an appropriate time. We hope that this \r\nmodest contribution will serve as a useful input to the \r\nongoing discussions on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nWhile Bhutan has made significant socioeconomic \r\nprogress, we face many challenges and vulnerabilities, \r\nbeing both a landlocked and a least developed country. \r\nOur economy remains import-driven and dependent \r\non a single export commodity. Poverty, youth \r\nunemployment, natural disasters and vulnerability to \r\nadverse impacts of climate change, including glacial \r\nlake outburst f loods, pose challenges. We will therefore \r\ncontinue to count on external support and assistance as \r\nwe work towards achieving our long-cherished goal of \r\nself-reliance and graduation from the least developed \r\ncountry category.\r\nWe recognize that a vibrant democracy should be \r\nbuilt on a strong economy, which is essential to bring \r\nabout improvement in the lives of the people. Therefore, \r\nin the eleventh Five-Year Development Plan, the main \r\nthrust will be to promote prosperity for all through \r\ninclusive social development, accelerated green \r\neconomic development and infrastructure development.\r\nThe United Nations, with its global scope and \r\nmandate, remains the only universal organization that \r\ncan forge a global coordinated response to the pressing \r\nchallenges in areas ranging from peace and security to \r\ndevelopment. The challenges of our times are, however, \r\ntesting the United Nations and the resolve of its Member \r\nStates to work together. Every effort must be made to \r\nstrengthen the role and efficacy of a United Nations that \r\nis just, democratic and representative and allows space \r\nbuilt. These principles must guide our efforts to come \r\nup with a holistic and transformative development \r\nagenda that puts people at the centre of development \r\nand brings about shared prosperity and happiness to \r\nall. Within this broader vision, poverty eradication \r\nmust form a central theme of the post-2015 agenda. For \r\nBhutan, the alleviation of poverty remains a challenge \r\nand features as a key priority in the current eleventh \r\nfive-year development plan.\r\nEqually important is the need to bring about \r\ninclusive development, which is one of the priority \r\nobjectives of the Royal Government of Bhutan. \r\nTargeted interventions are being planned to promote \r\nthe livelihoods of the poorest and most vulnerable \r\ncommunities in Bhutan.\r\nThe empowerment of women should constitute \r\none of the main building blocks of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Any development agenda will fall \r\nshort if it does not include the empowerment of women \r\nas a key component.\r\nIssues related to youth and to providing gainful \r\nemployment to a growing population is one of the \r\ncritical challenges that my country continues to face. \r\nIt is therefore vitally important that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda address the issues of youth, as \r\nthey are the key stakeholders of that era.\r\nI cannot overemphasize the importance of a \r\nstrong means of implementation in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Without it, the capacity of \r\ndeveloping and least developed countries to realize the \r\npost-2015 development priorities will remain severely \r\nchallenged. At the intergovernmental level, Bhutan \r\nwill continue its close engagement in the work of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, on which it is pleased to serve as a member. We \r\nlook forward to contributing to the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations towards the elaboration of a single post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nThe subject of development inevitably leads me to \r\nrefer to my country’s experience, in which it is guided \r\nby the development philosophy of Gross National \r\nHappiness, a vision that has given character to my \r\ncountry. Happiness and development have come to \r\nmean many things, and there are indeed many experts \r\nand a rich body of literature on the subject. This body \r\nalso adopted resolution 65/309, on happiness, at its \r\nsixty-fifth session, and resolution 66/281 proclaiming \r\n13-48953 17/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nDevelopment Goals are an important first step towards \r\naddressing some of the worst socioeconomic conditions \r\nfacing approximately 40 per cent of humankind, \r\ntargeted as they are at reducing the worst manifestations \r\nof underdevelopment.\r\nIn our view, the success of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals depends on two sets of simultaneous \r\nactions: first, a reorientation of national responsibilities; \r\nand, second, of equal importance, the reorientation of \r\nthe international community. Such reorientation will \r\nenable us to chart a more meaningful path towards \r\nmeeting the targets of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and moving towards the post-2015 Development \r\nagenda.\r\nThat is particularly relevant if we take heed of the \r\n2013 report on the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich reveals some rather interesting facts, such as: \r\nmost developing countries are performing well in \r\nmeeting the targets; and developed countries, which \r\nhave committed themselves to Goal 8 by making their \r\naid pledges viable and effective, are nevertheless well \r\nbehind in their general performance in meeting the \r\ntargets.\r\nOfficial development assistance is in constant \r\ndecline, and the agreements concluded in 2001 within \r\nthe context of the World Trade Organization to improve \r\naccess to international markets have been stalled during \r\nthe Doha Round. That stalling has proved to be so \r\nharmful that dealing with market access on behalf of the \r\npoorest nations has been left out of subsequent agendas. \r\nFurthermore, as we all know, the ongoing financial \r\nand economic crisis is having a detrimental impact \r\non developing nations because official development \r\nassistance is drastically declining.\r\nClearly, a number of large developing countries, \r\nmainly in Asia, as well as some countries endowed with \r\nnatural resources in Africa and South America, have \r\nmade substantial economic progress. Their statistics, \r\nhowever, should not blind us to the fact that inequality \r\nis rampant and that almost 1.2 billion people are still \r\nliving in extreme poverty and do not have access to \r\naffordable and adequate health services, while millions \r\nof children are still denied their right to primary \r\neducation.\r\nWe have learned the important lesson that developing \r\ncountries are obliged to undertake adequate measures \r\nto strengthen economic interactions among themselves \r\nin addition to ties with their traditional trading partners \r\nfor its Members, including the smallest, to participate \r\nfully in its work. That is the key to the legitimacy of an \r\neffective multilateral system.\r\nWe remain hopeful that under your able leadership, \r\nSir, the sixty-eighth session will further advance work \r\non the reform of the United Nations. The General \r\nAssembly must be revitalized and its role strengthened. \r\nThe membership of the Security Council in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories must \r\nbe expanded to bring it into line with contemporary \r\nrealities and to make the Council a more representative \r\nbody.\r\nThese are challenging times indeed. It falls upon \r\nus to seek the wisdom of those who created this great \r\ninstitution to work together in the spirit of international \r\ncooperation in solving international problems. We have \r\nthe opportunity not only to strengthen the role of the \r\nUnited Nations and advance multilateralism, but also to \r\ndefine a holistic development agenda that will respond \r\nto the universal aspiration for happiness.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Winston Lackin, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Suriname.\r\nMr. Lackin (Suriname): Allow me at the outset, on \r\nbehalf of the President of the Republic of Suriname, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, and the people \r\nand the Government of Suriname, to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your well-deserved election. \r\nWith your election you bring honour to your country, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, and to the Caribbean. With your \r\nbackground in sustainable development, you are well \r\nprepared to lead us in our deliberations on this year’s \r\ntheme, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the \r\nstage”. I assure you of the support and cooperation of \r\nSuriname during your presidency.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his \r\nleadership during the sixty-seventh session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Furthermore, I commend Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his management of the United \r\nNations with regard to peace and security in various \r\nparts of the globe.\r\nSetting a new stage urgently requires much effort \r\nat the national as well as the international level to \r\nachieve the ultimate goal of improving the standard of \r\nliving of our peoples and bringing about the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our countries. The Millennium \r\n18/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nWorld Health Organization, UNESCO, UNICEF and \r\nothers.\r\nThe Government also attaches great importance \r\nto issues involving young people. In this regard, a \r\nlarge-scale after-school programme with the aim of \r\nenhancing better learning for youth deserves mention. \r\nThe successful experiences in regional cooperation \r\nmechanisms, such as the one in the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), as well as the one that is \r\nbeing considered in the Union of South American \r\nNations (UNASUR), are clear examples of how youth \r\ncan contribute to the connectivity between peoples and \r\nthe enhancement of unity.\r\nTaking into account global processes and cognizant \r\nof the opportunities and challenges from CARICOM \r\nand UNASUR, the post-2015 development agenda \r\nshould emanate from an inclusive, intergovernmental \r\nprocess. That process should be directed towards: the \r\ncontinued eradication of poverty; a people-centred \r\napproach, combining economic activity with the social \r\nneed for education and health care, thereby promoting \r\nthe welfare and well-being of all; and the integration of \r\neconomic and social action and strengthening of human \r\ncapital.\r\nGlobal warming has a direct negative impact on \r\nthe development of small island developing States \r\nand low-lying coastal States, including Suriname. \r\nSuriname shares its grave concern regarding the state \r\nof the global climate and the stalled United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change process. \r\nThe Government of Suriname strongly recommends \r\nthat the General Assembly face these challenges by \r\nmaking them part of the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn setting the stage for development goals \r\nbeyond 2015, we cannot ignore the various threats to \r\ninternational peace. International peace, security and \r\nhuman rights are indispensable in creating an enabling \r\nenvironment for sustainable development. Suriname \r\nis well aware of the fact that national sovereignty \r\nand national security are seriously affected by the \r\nindiscriminate use of violence in fighting terrorism \r\nand other forms of transnational organized crime. \r\nChallenges related to armed conflicts, poverty, food, \r\nthe environment, education, public health, migration \r\nand energy require increased collaboration. In this \r\nrespect, partnership among Governments, international \r\nand regional organizations and civil society is a must. \r\nWe applaud the South American and Caribbean nations \r\nin the North. We must give substance to South-South \r\ncooperation. That is an important consideration for \r\nsetting a new stage for global sustainable development. \r\nIn this context, foreign direct investment is considered \r\nto be a factor of vital importance.\r\nIt is encouraging to note that a number of countries, \r\nincluding my own, Suriname, have been upgraded \r\nfrom low-income status to middle-income status by \r\ninternational financial institutions and United Nations \r\nagencies. Our efforts to develop prudent macroeconomic \r\nand appropriate fiscal policies, combined with our \r\ninitiatives to diversify our economy, and the sacrifices \r\nborne by our people, have led to this improved status. \r\nApplying per capita income as the major indicator for \r\ndetermining our development status has, however, \r\nmanoeuvred us into a position where we have lost \r\naccess to the necessary concessional loans and grants. \r\nThe conclusion can be drawn that our people are being \r\npunished for their ability to overcome some of the \r\nobstacles that have made them less fortunate in the past.\r\nWithin this interdependent world, we will continue \r\nto build on our own strength as the main driving \r\nforce for the achievement of our development agenda. \r\nFurthermore, we believe that building upon national \r\nstrengths, within the context of participation in \r\nsubregional and regional cooperation frameworks, is \r\nthe right way forward to finding proper solutions for \r\ndevelopment. On the basis of what has been achieved \r\nat the regional level, a global approach might become \r\nmore feasible.\r\nSuriname shares the view that we should base the \r\npost-2015 development agenda on a people-centred \r\napproach, with a specific focus on the most vulnerable \r\nin society, in particular, women, youth, the elderly \r\nand people with disabilities. In so doing —  and this \r\nwe emphasize — we should strike the right balance \r\nbetween our positive macroeconomic situation and a \r\nmicro situation that is in dire need of improvement.\r\nWe are in the course of developing policies and \r\nprogrammes to fight non-communicable diseases that \r\nhave led to decreased productivity. Non-communicable \r\ndiseases have now become the leading cause of death in \r\nSuriname and in other countries in our region. There is \r\nspecial emphasis on improving education and bringing \r\nit closer to our socioeconomic reality. We intend to work \r\nmore closely with relevant international organizations \r\nsuch as the Pan American Health Organization, the \r\n13-48953 19/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nAllow me to begin by expressing our solidarity \r\nwith the people of Kenya, while condemning in the \r\nstrongest terms the cowardly acts of terrorism that were \r\nseen last week.\r\nI thank you, Sir, for selecting as the theme for this \r\nsession “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage”, which, in my delegation’s view, embodies \r\nthe fundamental concerns of all countries, but will \r\nfind particular resonance with small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) like Grenada. This is an area where the \r\nmultilateral system must demonstrate its effectiveness \r\nnot only to improve the lives of ordinary citizens but also \r\nto maintain confidence in our multilateral institutions. \r\nWe look forward to key performance indicators linked \r\nto tangible outcomes, rather than more analysis and \r\nmore reports.\r\nGrenada endorses the call made at the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development for \r\nthe future we want. In that context, we must build on \r\nthe successes of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand Agenda 21. Indeed, for a post-2015 development \r\nagenda we welcome a framework that goes beyond gross \r\ndomestic product and recognizes the assets of natural \r\ncapital. Grenada encourages the international financial \r\ninstitutions to go even further by also recognizing the \r\nliabilities associated with natural disasters caused by \r\nclimate change. Those liabilities underscore the need \r\nto reassess the basis on which small island developing \r\nStates are graduated to middle-income status, thereby \r\nlosing access to concessionary funding that is sorely \r\nneeded.\r\nThe unilateral graduation of many small island \r\ndeveloping States to middle-income status is premature. \r\nI therefore reiterate the call made in Agenda 21 for a \r\nmore holistic and comprehensive set of indicators for \r\nclassifying States. Grenada endorses support for low-\r\nincome and fragile economies. Moreover, it is clear that \r\nseveral of the SIDS newly promoted to middle-income \r\nstatus continue to struggle with high debt burdens, \r\nwhich are worsened by climate change and high fossil-\r\nfuel import bills. Many SIDS also struggle with low \r\nproductivity and low levels of competitiveness and with \r\nsevere financial constraints, and, in some cases, they \r\nstruggle with limited prospects for immediate growth.\r\nThe point is that per capita income used as a sole \r\nmeasure without the context of climate vulnerability \r\ndoes more harm than good. To illustrate that point, as \r\ndamaging as Hurricanes Sandy and Katrina were to the \r\nfor their efforts towards regional peace and stability. \r\nTheir willingness and capacity for further dialogue and \r\npersuasion is a better way to achieve and maintain peace \r\nthan the use of violence and military intervention.\r\nWe are proud to belong to a region that has declared \r\nitself a nuclear-weapon-free zone.\r\nWe express the hope that the two-State solution to \r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict will gain more substance, \r\nallowing the peoples of both countries the prospect of \r\npeace and prosperity. Suriname maintains the position \r\nthat the multilateral process within the United Nations \r\nshould prevail in the search for a peaceful solution for \r\nthe crisis in Syria.\r\nThe Cuban people have the right to participate \r\nas full members in all regional organizations, and we \r\nstrongly urge that all obstacles that have prevented \r\ntheir full participation so far be removed, including the \r\noutdated and inhuman unilateral economic, financial \r\nand commercial embargo.\r\nWith regard to the Republic of Haiti, the \r\ninternational community tends to lose attention for \r\nthe necessary follow-up activities to get Haiti back \r\non its feet. Once again we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to fulfil its commitments.\r\nIn closing, I take advantage of this opportunity \r\nto inform the Assembly that, exactly 30 days ago, \r\nmy country, Suriname, took over the pro tempore \r\npresidency of the Union of South American Nations, \r\na young and vibrant regional body. We pledge that \r\nSuriname will, during its presidency, further the goals \r\nof UNASUR and contribute to international peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Nickolas Steele, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and International Business of Grenada.\r\nMr. Steele (Grenada): I wish to extend my sincere \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. The fact that you were elected by consensus \r\nspeaks in unequivocal terms of the high esteem in \r\nwhich you are held by your colleagues and the respect \r\nthat you command in this forum. I am confident that \r\nyour vast practical experience at the multilateral level \r\nwill serve you in good stead as you guide this session \r\nto a fruitful outcome. In the same breath, I pay tribute \r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, for his astute \r\nstewardship at the previous session.\r\n20/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\ndevelopment as the organizing theme for the \r\ndevelopment of our island and for our engagement \r\nwith international partners. Grenada is a party to more \r\nthan 40 multilateral environmental agreements. The \r\npush to harmonize local laws with those international \r\ninstruments is testament to Grenada’s commitment to \r\nthat agenda. The reasons are clear, the causes of climate \r\nchange and the impacts of climate change are negatively \r\naffecting Grenada’s ability to fulfil its social contract \r\nwith its people, including its ability to fully deliver on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nSo far I have spoken only about economic \r\nsustainability and environmental sustainability. The \r\nthird pillar of sustainable development relates to \r\nsocial sustainability. Grenada is a society in which \r\nsocial development is given equal weighting with the \r\nimportance of investment and economic growth driven \r\nby the private sector. On 13 May, a mere three months \r\nafter assuming office, my Government ratified the \r\nInternational Convention on the Elimination of All \r\nForms of Racial Discrimination. We are proceeding \r\napace to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities, thus demonstrating that Grenada is \r\ncommitted to the removal of all forms of discrimination.\r\nGrenada associates itself with efforts to dedicate the \r\nCaribbean region to the development of humanity. We \r\nalso acknowledge that through the ages the Arab world \r\nhas contributed enormously to the world of science \r\nand mathematics, including the very numerals we use \r\ntoday. We see a modern Arab world taking positive \r\nsteps to take the lead in developing breakthroughs on \r\nthe key issues that confront our planet. We very much \r\nwelcome initiatives such as Masdar City and the hosting \r\nof the International Renewable Energy Agency by the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. The role of Qatar in hosting \r\nthe United Nations Climate Change Conference is \r\nalso noteworthy. Grenada joins with other countries in \r\nseeking to deepen our relationship with the countries of \r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council and places a high degree \r\nof importance on the peace and security of the region.\r\nWe are mindful that the region and the entire United \r\nNations system have been seized of the issues of peace \r\nand security during United Nations Week. Grenada and \r\nmany countries in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nare home to a vibrant and entrepreneurial diaspora \r\nfrom the Middle East, including people from Syria and \r\nLebanon. As a consequence, Grenadian citizens are \r\nvery concerned about the prospects for peace in Syria \r\nand the wider Middle East.\r\nUnited States economy, the costs ran between 0.5 per \r\ncent and 2 per cent of the gross domestic product of the \r\nUnited States. That is in sharp contrast to the costs of \r\nbetween 20 per cent and 200 per cent of gross domestic \r\nproduct when hurricanes hit island economies.\r\nTherefore, Grenada is joining with other SIDS in \r\nurging the shareholders, the donors and the boards of \r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \r\nto translate the recognition of climate vulnerability \r\nin small island States into a meaningful package of \r\nfinancial and official development assistance for SIDS.\r\nThe issue of the graduation of SIDS is an issue that \r\nhas been raised year after year. Let us return to the \r\nGeneral Assembly next year confident that progress on \r\nthat matter has been made. In that regard, we wish to \r\nsuggest for consideration during your presidency, Sir, a \r\ncall for a substantive paper and a debate on the issue. \r\nIdeally, the outcomes of that debate should be provided \r\nas an input towards the 2014 third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States, to be \r\nhosted by Samoa, and as an input to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s debate on climate change scheduled for \r\nSeptember 2014.\r\nAlso contributing to the indebtedness and fiscal \r\nunsustainability of small island States are the volatility \r\nand high prices for fossil fuels. On average, small \r\nisland developing States are paying between 20 cents \r\nand 40 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity, some \r\nas high as $1. That contrasts with prices of 5 cents to \r\n15 cents in developed countries. We welcome, therefore, \r\nthe initiative of the Alliance of Small Island States in \r\nestablishing the SIDS DOCK Support Programme. \r\nWe also wish to express gratitude to the donors and \r\ninstitutions for helping to facilitate that programme.\r\nIn addition, the Government of Grenada is taking \r\nmajor steps towards creating a green economy. One \r\nof the priorities for Grenada’s Prime Minister, The \r\nRight Honourable Keith Mitchell, is the dismantling of \r\na monopoly that is contributing to high energy costs \r\non the island of Grenada. The Government is seeking \r\npartners to help create a level playing field, which \r\nwill allow many more private-sector players to have \r\na role in innovative and substantive power-generation \r\nsolutions, while positioning Grenada as an exemplar for \r\na sustainable planet.\r\nMr. President, as you have chosen the theme of \r\nsustainability for the sixty-eighth session, so too \r\nhas the Government of Grenada chosen sustainable \r\n13-48953 21/22\r\n30/09/2013 A/68/PV.22\r\nFinally, my delegation uses this occasion once \r\nmore to express our solidarity with the Cuban people, \r\nwho continue to suffer from an unnecessary economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo that is a relic of the \r\nCold War. Grenada once again calls on the United States \r\nof America to respect the views of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of humanity and lift the onerous measures \r\nimposed over five decades ago now.\r\nWe support your theme, Mr. President, for this \r\nsixty-eighth session and wish to assure our partners that \r\nthey can count on Grenada to be an active participant in \r\nthese deliberations and in the implementation of their \r\noutcomes.\r\nGrenada is open for business. My Government \r\nrecognizes that a tried-and-tested route to sustainable \r\ndevelopment involves a significant component of \r\nforeign direct investment. Grenada therefore reaches \r\nout and seeks new friendships while maintaining and \r\nbuilding upon its existing and long-standing relations \r\nwith many States members of this body.\r\nIn 2014 Grenada marks its fortieth anniversary of \r\nindependence, and we invite each and every Member to \r\ncelebrate with us on 7 February. We also see our 40 years \r\nas a milestone that recognizes 40 years of struggle, \r\n40 years of development. But also, more importantly, it \r\nmarks 40 years of expectations not yet fully delivered \r\nupon. As such, my Government, under the leadership \r\nof our Prime Minister, sees this year as the year of less \r\ntalk and more action, the year of tangible deliverables, \r\nand the year that great socioeconomic strides are made. \r\nWe have a young and vibrant population that cannot \r\nwait any longer, that should not wait any longer, and \r\nwith the help and cooperation of our friends, new and \r\nold, we will deliver. They will not wait any longer.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nTwo Member States have asked to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply. May I remind members that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): The Government of \r\nIndonesia strongly rejects the statement concerning \r\nthe so-called issue of West Papua made by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, Mr. Moana Kalosil \r\nGrenada condemns, in the most vehement terms, \r\natrocities and crimes against humanity. We therefore \r\nbelieve that those responsible for the recent deadly use \r\nof chemical weapons in Syria must be held accountable \r\nby the international community. Moreover, Grenada \r\nwelcomes Security Council resolution 2118 (2013), on \r\ndestroying Syria’s chemical weapons, and is encouraged \r\nby the commitment of the Syrian Government to comply \r\nwith that resolution. More importantly, my delegation \r\nhopes that that breakthrough could be a stepping stone \r\nto the resolution of the already brutal and bloody civil \r\nwar in Syria, which has been fuelled by conventional \r\nweapons.\r\nOn 3 June, Grenada joined 83 States in signing \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty on the very first morning that \r\nthe Treaty was opened for signature. Work is already \r\nunder way at the national level for the ratification of the \r\nTreaty, yet another signal of Grenada’s commitment to \r\npeace and security. Moreover, being the first country \r\nto accede to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, \r\nGrenada intends to use its experience to raise awareness \r\non that particular matter, especially in the Americas.\r\nOn the question of Israeli-Palestinian relations, \r\nGrenada remains convinced that a two-State solution is \r\nessential to ending that conflict and urges both parties \r\nto conduct the present round of negotiations in good \r\nfaith. Grenada has good relations with the Government \r\nand people of Israel and is a strong advocate for \r\nIsrael’s right to coexist in peace with its neighbours. \r\nFurthermore, Grenada has long been a supporter \r\nof the people of Palestine. Grenada is proud to have \r\njoined with neighbouring countries in recognizing \r\nthe State of Palestine and in signing a memorandum \r\nof understanding based upon friendship and upon an \r\nunderstanding of a two-State solution.\r\nAs with most of the world, Grenada looked at \r\nthe Arab Spring with great interest. The use of social \r\nmedia underscores the rise of technology as a tool for \r\ndemocracy on a 24/7 basis, and my Prime Minister \r\nplaces great importance on the use of information and \r\ncommunication technologies as a way to engage our \r\nyouth. As Egypt goes through its transition and its \r\npeople’s call for freedom, dignity and social justice is \r\nheard, we encourage the leaders to learn the lessons of \r\nthe recent past and respond to the will of the people \r\nin moving forward to a system of true democracy and \r\nrespect for human rights and inclusive processes for \r\nnation-building.\r\n22/22 13-48953\r\nA/68/PV.22 30/09/2013\r\nFinally, Indonesia for its part will not be distracted \r\nby such inclinations. We will continue our development \r\nefforts in the provinces in the context of their special \r\nautonomy, and we will persevere in the promotion of \r\nfriendly relations with the Government and the people \r\nof Vanuatu based on the principles governing friendly \r\nrelations between countries.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Pakistan): In her statement of \r\n27 September (see A/68/PV.16), the Prime Minister of \r\nBangladesh used this forum to make some references \r\nrelating to Pakistan that are not supported by the facts. \r\nWe are deeply dismayed by the statement, because \r\nPakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries and at \r\none point the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh were \r\ncitizens of one country. Even today, there is warmth \r\nand goodwill between our two peoples. Multiple \r\nchannels of communication are available between the \r\ntwo Governments.\r\nThe Bangladesh statement was acrimonious and a \r\nmisrepresentation of facts. Its premise was incorrect, \r\nfacts f lawed, and its legal dimensions untenable. We \r\nbelieve that raising an issue that has little relevance \r\nin contemporary Pakistan-Bangladesh relations is \r\nunhelpful and counterproductive. Nevertheless, the \r\nGovernment and the people of Pakistan will continue \r\nto work towards strengthening friendly ties with the \r\nGovernment and the people of Bangladesh.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.20 p.m.\r\nCarcasses, in the General Assembly on Saturday, \r\n28 September (see A/68/PV.18).\r\nAt best, such a statement reflects an unfortunate \r\nlack of understanding of the basic facts on the historical \r\nrole of the United Nations and the principled position \r\nof the international community at large, as well as \r\ncurrent developments in the Indonesian provinces of \r\nPapua and West Papua. Worse still, it suggests an utter \r\nrefusal to acknowledge certain basic facts on matters \r\nrelating to the aforementioned provinces and the efforts \r\nof the Indonesian Government and the local authorities \r\nto promote the general welfare and prosperity of the \r\npeople in the two provinces.\r\nWe are only too conscious of the fact that internal \r\npolitical dynamics in Vanuatu have often played a role \r\nin raising the so-called issue of West Papua at the United \r\nNations. That fact was acknowledged in a statement \r\nreportedly made by the Vanuatu Prime Minister’s \r\noffice in May 2012 and published by the Vanuatu Daily \r\nPost on 22 May 2012, which, inter alia, stated:\r\n“In Vanuatu, the West Papua issue has been \r\npoliticized and used by different political parties \r\nand movements not for the interests of the people in \r\nWest Papua, but more so for elections and political \r\ncampaign propaganda”.\r\nI must emphasize that that statement was issued not \r\nby the Government of Indonesia, but by none other than \r\nthe then Government of Vanuatu itself.\r\n"
