"In the absence of the President, Mr. Tommo Monthe \r\n(Cameroon), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration \r\nand Development\r\nAgenda item 21 (continued)\r\nGlobalization and interdependence\r\n(e) International migration and development\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/190)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/68/162)\r\nMr. Brown (Jamaica): I have the honour to address \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on behalf of the Government \r\nof Jamaica. We wish to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comprehensive report on international migration and \r\ndevelopment (A/68/190) and to commend the relevant \r\norganizations, such as the International Organization \r\nfor Migration and the Global Migration Group, for \r\ntheir invaluable contributions, which have made this \r\nimportant High-level Dialogue possible.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade earlier by the representative of Fiji on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.25).\r\nSince the first United Nations High-level Dialogue \r\non this subject, held in 2006, Jamaica has demonstrated \r\nits commitment to optimizing the benefits of migration, \r\nwhile minimizing its challenges, through national and \r\ninternational activities aimed at empowering migrants, \r\nprotecting their rights and addressing the diverse and \r\ncomplex issues associated with migration. Since that \r\ntime, Jamaica, and indeed the entire international \r\ncommunity, has had to address the impact of emerging \r\nissues such as the environment, human trafficking and \r\nthe impact of climate change on migration.\r\nWe have made every effort to include those issues \r\nin our deliberations at the national level and to identify \r\nstrategies that will make migration work for countries of \r\norigin, destination and transit — and, more important, \r\nthe migrants themselves. They include actively pursuing \r\nactions that protect the human rights of all migrants, \r\nincluding eliminating migrant exploitation, of which \r\nhuman trafficking is a case in point; integrate migration \r\ninto the development agenda; strengthen the migration \r\nevidence base in order to ensure that the data informing \r\npolicy and programme development are relevant and \r\ncurrent; and enhance migration partnerships and \r\ncooperation, including strengthening partnerships \r\nwith the diaspora. In so doing, the Government of \r\nJamaica is committed to providing an environment that \r\nrespects the human rights and dignity of all migrants, \r\nin accordance with its Constitution and international \r\nobligations. The legislative framework for that exists \r\nand is designed to foster coherence, coordination and \r\nharmonization, thereby providing protection for all \r\nresidents, including migrants.\r\nThe Government of Jamaica has also developed \r\nstrategies aimed at improving its capacity to monitor \r\nand manage international migration, in line with the \r\ncountry’s socioeconomic development priorities, as \r\noutlined in its national development plan, Vision 2030. \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.26\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 3 October 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In that regard, we \r\nrecognize that the country’s growth and prosperity \r\nagenda is incomplete without the commitment and \r\nactive participation of the diaspora.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that Jamaica \r\nreiterates its support for this High-level Dialogue and \r\nhopes that the outcome of the meeting will ensure \r\nthat international migration is adequately measured \r\nand monitored in order for the development needs of \r\ncountries such as Jamaica to be served and to address \r\nchallenges such as determining how to recast and \r\nreassess the conversation around the “brain drain” \r\nissue, so as to examine the issue of brain gain and brain \r\ncirculation more closely, and how to manage remittances \r\nfor national development, poverty reduction and social \r\nwell-being.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Today’s \r\nevent gives us all a good opportunity to discuss \r\nmigration issues in the broader context of moving \r\ntowards the global post-2015 development agenda.\r\nInternational migration today is a significant factor \r\nin the development of countries and entire regions. \r\nBelarus is not an exception in that regard. For my \r\ncountry, migration policy is an important component of \r\nour national development planning processes. Enacted \r\nlegislation, policies that promote national and cultural \r\ndiversity and the absence of conflicts on national, \r\nethnic or religious grounds contribute to the f low of \r\nmigrants into our country.\r\nMigrants arriving in Belarus enjoy the same \r\nrights as Belarusian citizens. Migration legislation in \r\nBelarus takes into account international experience \r\nand commonly accepted legal norms and principles, \r\nincluding key elements of the International Convention \r\non the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \r\nand Members of Their Families. In 2011, Belarus enacted \r\na new version of its law on external labour migration, \r\npursuant to which all migrant workers, regardless of \r\ntheir gender, race, nationality, language, religion or \r\npolitical beliefs — provided that they do not interfere \r\nThe assistance of the international donor community \r\nhas been invaluable in developing the policy, and we \r\nwish to thank them for being partners in the process. In \r\nthat regard, the Government has developed a national \r\npolicy and plan of action on international migration \r\nand development that addresses the broad and evolving \r\nrange of challenges and opportunities associated with \r\nmigration. The policy is meant to manage migration \r\nin ways that more effectively integrate it into national \r\ndevelopment planning. That will be achieved by \r\nharnessing migration’s development potential to benefit \r\nsociety and migrants through sustainable development \r\nand poverty-reduction strategies. The national policy \r\nand plan of action also recognizes that migration \r\nstimulates the creation of new economic opportunities \r\nin destination countries and that migrants become true \r\nagents of development through the transfer of human, \r\nsocial and financial capital. We encourage our partners \r\nthat have not yet done so to develop national plans and \r\nforge partnerships at the national and global levels, \r\nwhich can in turn improve cooperation between and \r\namong States.\r\nJamaica recognizes the contribution of migration to \r\nall three pillars of sustainable development — economic, \r\nsocial and environmental — and acknowledges that \r\nmigrants are potential agents of development who are \r\nwell positioned to strengthen cooperation between \r\ncountries of origin and destination. In that regard, we \r\ndeveloped an extended migration profile, launched \r\non 4 September 2012, as part of the larger process \r\nof developing our national policy. The profile, the \r\nfirst of its kind in the Caribbean, is a critical tool for \r\nimproving knowledge on migration and development \r\nissues; enhancing the Government’s ability to manage \r\nmigration; and addressing the gaps identified in the \r\ncollection and analysis of migration-related data. We \r\nhave highlighted improved data management as a \r\nnational priority in order to support the formulation of \r\nevidence-based policy planning.\r\nWe believe that global migration and development \r\nperspectives should be people-friendly, enabling \r\ncountries of origin and destination, and migrants \r\nthemselves, to share equitably in the benefits of \r\nmigration. The Government of Jamaica therefore \r\nsupports efforts to reduce the costs of labour migration. \r\nIn that regard, every effort should be made to reduce the \r\ntransfer costs of remittances, which often constitute a \r\nsupplementary source of household income that affords \r\nbasic necessities to families left behind. Jamaica also \r\n13-49793 3/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nof Friends United against Human Trafficking, during \r\nwhich representatives of various regions shared their \r\nlegislative and law-enforcement experience with regard \r\nto preventing illegal migration and combating human \r\ntrafficking.\r\nThis year, Belarus holds the presidency of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States. Accordingly, \r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to the \r\nregional position of its member States on migration \r\nissues, which was previously circulated as an official \r\ndocument at the current session of the General \r\nAssembly. That position, which was prepared in \r\nthe context of today’s Dialogue, reaffirms the role \r\nand influence of the United Nations in shaping the \r\nprinciples of the Commonwealth States’ migration \r\npolicies and underscores the intention of our States \r\nto pursue comprehensive interaction in areas related \r\nto the impact of migration processes on sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nBelarus welcomes the activities of the United \r\nNations system in relation to migration issues. We \r\nare gratified that the subjects of migration and the \r\nprotection of the rights of migrants have been reflected \r\nin the new strategic plans of the main United Nations \r\nagencies: the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF and \r\nUN Women. However, in our view, the United Nations \r\nand other international organizations and groups should \r\nplay a more active role in creating and strengthening \r\nnetworks on migration and development, identifying \r\nbest practices and building a knowledge and information \r\nplatform for policy-making in the field of migration and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nI am confident that today’s Dialogue, which is \r\nbeing held under the auspices of the United Nations, \r\nwill facilitate addressing those and many other issues \r\nrelated to international migration and development. \r\nBelarus stands ready to do everything it can to \r\ncontribute to such work.\r\nMr. Montero (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): Let \r\nme begin by saying that the Government of Costa Rica \r\nwishes to express its condolences to the families of the \r\nvictims of the regrettable events occurring off the coast \r\nof Italy.\r\nCosta Rica would like to emphasize the tremendous \r\noptimism that this Dialogue has triggered in my \r\ncountry. The position of Costa Rica with respect to this \r\nDialogue is the outcome of a broad-based and cross-\r\nwith the performance of their work duties — enjoy \r\nequal rights for entry into Belarus.\r\nBelarus adopted and is implementing a national \r\nprogramme on demographic security for the period \r\n2011-2015. It contains a set of measures that are aimed \r\nat addressing migration issues for the good of national \r\ndevelopment. In order to attract migrant workers into the \r\ncountry and mindful of our investment and educational \r\npotential, since 2012 we have reduced the period of \r\nreview for the issuance of permanent residence permits \r\nin the case of aliens for whom an employer has filed an \r\napplication.\r\nI would like to point out that Belarus, like many \r\nother countries, faces a problem with the emigration \r\nof its highly qualified specialists — the so-called \r\n“brain drain” problem. We believe that the solution to \r\nthe problem lies not only in national measures taken to \r\nimprove social and economic conditions for the relevant \r\ncategories of population; it is equally important for us \r\nto establish partnerships with countries of destination, \r\nincluding streamlined recruitment practices for \r\nBelarusian experts in foreign countries as well as the \r\ndevelopment of cooperation in the field of professional \r\ntraining of staff in Belarus.\r\nCurrently, Belarus has elaborated a draft legislative \r\nact that provides for the issuance of a permanent \r\nresidence permit to stateless persons who have no \r\npermanent country of residence and who reside in \r\nBelarus over a long period. The draft also contains two \r\nimportant provisions — aliens who become employed \r\nin a profession that they prepared for by studying at \r\na Belarusian educational establishment will be exempt \r\nfrom needing to receive a special work permit, and \r\nprofessionals with exceptional capabilities and skills \r\nwill enjoy favourable conditions for moving to and \r\nsettling in Belarus.\r\nBelarus is interested in fostering international \r\ncooperation on migration issues at the bilateral, \r\nregional and global levels. We have established dynamic \r\ncooperation with the International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM). With the support of the IOM, an \r\ninternational training centre that provides training, \r\nadvanced training and retraining of personnel in \r\nthe field of migration and the fight against human \r\ntrafficking was opened in 2007 in the city of Minsk. \r\nThe centre runs training activities for representatives \r\nof national and foreign law-enforcement agencies. In \r\nMay 2013, with the financial support of the Russian \r\nFederation, the centre hosted a seminar for the Group \r\n4/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nHigh-level Dialogue,” which will be distributed to \r\nparticipants in due course.\r\nIn addition to allocating more resources, at the \r\nState level we must devise public policies intended to \r\neliminate prejudices and stereotypes associated with \r\nmigration. We must also commit to actively promoting \r\ngenuine equality for all individuals, including migrants. \r\nTo that end, we must look at the real situation and needs \r\nof the most vulnerable migrants, such as girls and boys; \r\nindigenous persons; the elderly; the disabled; lesbian, \r\ngay, bisexual, transsexual, transgender and intersex \r\npersons; and temporary and domestic workers. We \r\nmust develop robust measures to prevent, combat and \r\npunish violations of their rights, such as discrimination \r\nand xenophobia. We must also work together to prevent \r\nmigrants from becoming victims of such crimes as \r\ntrafficking in persons and illicit smuggling. Costa Rica \r\nurges participants to ensure that all authorities dealing \r\nwith the challenges of immigration at the global and \r\nregional levels work in close coordination with all \r\nstakeholders in this area.\r\nWe do not think that we need to establish new \r\nentitie; we must strengthen those that already exist. \r\nTo that end, we must acknowledge the work that has \r\nbeen undertaken by the International Organization for \r\nMigration for more than 60 years and strengthen its \r\ninteraction with United Nations agencies. We consider \r\nit important that efforts made within the Global \r\nForum contribute to regional consultation processes. \r\nThe work of the Global Migration Group should also \r\nbe better coordinated with that of the United Nations \r\ncountry team. It is essential to ensure in all forums \r\nwhere migration is discussed that we take account of \r\nthe voices of civil society and, of course, of migrants \r\nthemselves.\r\nThere are many challenges before us to ensure that \r\nmigration contributes to development. However, we \r\nhave made  significant progress since the first High-level \r\nDialogue. Costa Rica trusts that, on this occasion, we \r\nwill make further progress, and we therefore reiterate \r\nour commitment to achieving concrete outcomes from \r\nthis high-level event.\r\nMr. Holmås (Norway): Let me start by expressing \r\nmy heartfelt condolences to the many people affected \r\nby the tragedy in the Mediterranean Sea, where at \r\nleast 130 African migrants have died and many more \r\nare missing after a boat carrying them to Europe sank \r\nin the early hours of this morning. More than 2,000 \r\npeople have been reported dead after having tried to \r\ncutting process of reflection, emphasizing the inclusive \r\nand open approach that should be adopted when talking \r\nabout migration. Governments should not decide or \r\ntake action on migration without hearing the voices of \r\nmigrants, their family members, their employers and \r\nthose who study migration issues.\r\nCosta Rica is the prime destination for migrants in \r\nCentral America. Immigration has been a major factor \r\nin achieving progress in key sectors such as trade, \r\nagriculture and infrastructure. Moreover, our culture \r\nhas been enriched by the input of migrants. Therefore, \r\nwe would like to invite participants in this Dialogue \r\nto recognize fully the contribution of migration in the \r\nconstruction of our respective nations.\r\nMoreover, my country is notable for its determined \r\ncommitment to the recognition, promotion and \r\nobservance of human rights. For many years, we have \r\nbeen guaranteeing migrants’ access to services for basic \r\neducation, health, prenatal care, school meals and care, \r\nregardless of their immigration status. The outcome of \r\nthose policies allows us today to corroborate the fact \r\nthat migrants’ access to such services generates greater \r\nbenefits for all. Costa Rica therefore reiterates its \r\ninvitation so that during this event we take decisive steps \r\nforward in favour of the human rights of all migrants, \r\nby recognizing conclusively their right to have access to \r\npublic services. In that regard, we call the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the realities that exist in countries such as \r\nCosta Rica in meeting those commitments.\r\nWe are a middle-income country with a significant \r\ninflow of immigrants. Our desire to provide more and \r\nbetter services to them is limited by our scant financial \r\nresources. The international community should \r\ntherefore allocate resources to guarantee the economic \r\nsustainability of such services. For Costa Rica that is \r\nan imperative in achieving sustainable development. \r\nIf we want to see the dual strands of migration and \r\ndevelopment occurring simultaneously, then it is \r\ncrucial that additional resources be devoted to that end. \r\nWe cannot do it alone.\r\nIn seeking increased funding for migration and \r\ndevelopment, Costa Rica would like to propose to the \r\ninternational community that we promote innovative \r\nmechanisms that make it possible to benefit migrants \r\nand destination countries alike, either by establishing \r\njoint funds or by facilitating access to loans intended \r\nto meet the needs of vulnerable migrants or other forms \r\nof cooperation funding. Those proposals are set out in \r\nthe document entitled “Costa Rica’s initiative for the \r\n13-49793 5/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\ndisabled people, who we also know are vulnerable in \r\nsuch situations. We work together with international \r\norganizations, and we must ensure our regulations do \r\nnot undermine the human rights of irregular migrants.\r\nSecondly, we need mechanisms for protecting \r\nmigrants during times of environmental disasters and \r\ncrises. Climate change will lead to more migration in \r\nfuture, both within and between nations. Therefore, \r\nNorway and Switzerland have initiated the Nansen \r\nInitiative, which gathers information on the protection \r\nneeds of people displaced by natural disasters and \r\nclimate change. The Nansen Initiative holds regional \r\nconsultations in the most affected regions of the world. \r\nTo date, we have learned that a stronger protection \r\nregime is needed for people falling into that category.\r\nThirdly, we need measures to help integrate \r\nmigrants into their new host communities, with \r\nparticular attention to women and children. If we \r\ninvest in migrants’ access to education and labour, we \r\nknow that they will give back much more, both to their \r\nhomelands and their host nations.\r\nWe also know that no person should be \r\ndiscriminated against or excluded for having an \r\nimmigrant background. In Norway, particular policy \r\nattention is paid to how unaccompanied minors and \r\nwomen migrants are received and integrated into \r\nsociety, and to the barriers women migrants encounter \r\nwhen trying to enter the labour market.\r\nIn order for migration to be a positive component \r\nin our international development efforts, we will seek \r\nand strengthen our work to include migrant groups \r\nand make better use of their contextual knowledge \r\nand skills. We believe that that approach will further \r\nimprove the quality of our development assistance and \r\ncontribute to a more sustainable development of the \r\naffected country. In the case of Somalia, we see that \r\nmany migrants from diaspora countries such as Norway \r\nand the United States are moving back to take part in \r\nthe reconstruction of their war-aff licted countries. One \r\nexample from Norway is the Speaker of the Somali \r\nParliament, my countryman Mohamed Osman Jawari, \r\nwho returned to Mogadishu after many years in the \r\nNorwegian workforce, where, among other things, he \r\nworked on conflict resolution — a skill I think he will \r\nneed back in Somalia.\r\nI believe that people who belong to two cultures \r\ncan be indispensable resources in either country, and \r\nthat we should adopt policies to make it possible and \r\ncross those waters in recent years. The rising global \r\nphenomenon of migrants and people f leeing conflict \r\nor persecution and perishing at sea underscores the \r\nimportance of the topic at this High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development.\r\nBut let me start at another place. During the \r\nmass migration from Europe in the mid-nineteenth \r\ncentury, more than a quarter of Norway’s population \r\nleft poverty and hardship behind. Their aim was to \r\nget a better life abroad. Most Norwegian migrants \r\nwent to this country — to the United States — where \r\nthey participated in building a modern and prosperous \r\nnation. Today their descendants continue to work hard \r\nand contribute to American society. They are proud \r\nboth of their homeland and their Norwegian roots.\r\nThe Monopoly board game has a card that says \r\n“Received from your uncle in the United States, 1,500 \r\nNorwegian kroner”. That is just the same thing that \r\nhappened a couple of decades back, and is happening \r\nin the world today. But then the money went to Norway, \r\nnow it goes to other States.\r\nSince that mass exodus, Norway has developed \r\ninto an Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment country, with one of the highest per capita \r\nimmigration rates. More than two thirds of Norway’s \r\npopulation growth is due to immigration. Today, \r\nNorway depends on immigrants for developing many \r\nareas of our industry and for the provision of services. \r\nIn a world when more people are on the move than ever \r\nbefore, I believe that it is our common responsibility to \r\nmaximize the positive impact of international migration \r\non development.\r\nMy country’s history of migration has shown that \r\nhuman mobility can be a key driver of human progress \r\nand development. Migration brings opportunities, \r\nbut it also entails challenges and risks. Appropriate \r\nand coherent policies need to be implemented so that \r\ninternational migration can be a better tool for poverty \r\nreduction. Such policies should include the following.\r\nFirst, there should be measures to ensure safe, \r\nhumane and orderly migration in accordance with \r\nhuman rights. We need a human rights-based approach. \r\nFor example, we should scale up international, regional \r\nand national efforts to combat the exploitation of people \r\nwhen they are being trafficked. We know that women \r\nare forced into prostitution, that children are forced \r\ninto slave labour and that women and children are \r\nparticularly vulnerable. Only last week we spoke about \r\n6/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nmigration should be streamlined and move towards \r\ncivilized development and support for migrant workers. \r\nA new long-term national policy to regulate migration \r\nprocesses led to the drafting last year of a strategy to \r\nregulate external labour migration through the year \r\n2020 and a plan of action for its implementation for the \r\nperiod 2013-2017. Last June, our President established \r\nan inter-agency group that is currently working to \r\nimplement that plan.\r\nToday, the entire international community \r\nagrees that migration plays a very important role in \r\nachieving many of the development goals enshrined \r\nin the Millennium Declaration. We are certain that \r\nwe need to work together to ensure that the issues we \r\nare discussing today are reflected in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation \r\nto the International Organization for Migration and the \r\nInternational Labour Organization for their support \r\nto Kyrgyzstan, as well as to express our full support \r\nfor the work of the Global Forum on Migration and \r\nDevelopment and the Global Migration Group.\r\nMs. Simonné (Hungary): Hungary is honoured \r\nto be present at this important event. Migration is a \r\nphenomenon that connects us all and compels us to \r\nwork towards a better future.\r\nMigration has many faces, effects and consequences, \r\nwhich requires a multifaceted approach. We believe \r\nthat both the positive and negative sides of migration \r\ncan be addressed more effectively through continuous \r\ncooperation, dialogue and knowledge transfer among \r\nall actors involved. Hungary is firmly committed to \r\nmutual cooperation and partnership with States and \r\nother actors in the framework of various regional \r\nconsultative processes.\r\nOur capital, Budapest, is proud to share its name \r\nwith the longest-standing regional cooperation process \r\nin the region, the Budapest Process. This year, that \r\nplatform celebrated its twentieth anniversary and, at \r\nthe same time, has renewed itself and established the \r\nSilk Routes Partnership for Migration, which will focus \r\non many aspects of migration, from legal to irregular \r\nmigration, returns and the fight against trafficking, to \r\ninternational protection issues. Turkey, the Chair, and \r\nHungary, the co-Chair, along with the Partnership’s \r\n53 States and more than 10 international organizations, \r\nwill work towards one main goal, namely, promoting \r\ndialogue and mutual cooperation in managing the \r\neasier for people to contribute in both countries, both \r\nalone and with their families.\r\nIn conclusion, we shall do more to systematically \r\ninclude diasporas in development efforts. It is important \r\nthat the potential positive role of international migration \r\nin reducing poverty and fostering human development \r\nbe reflected in a new post-2015 development agenda. \r\nTargets and indicators for which countries can be held \r\naccountable should be included in that development \r\nagenda: it should be a total package.\r\nMr. Isakov (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): Allow \r\nme to express my appreciation for the convening of \r\nthis High-level Dialogue to address migration issues \r\nthrough the prism of development.\r\nRecent data show that there are approximately \r\n232 million international migrants, a large proportion \r\nof whom are migrant workers. Almost one fifth of the \r\npopulation of the Kyrgyz Republic is engaged in labour \r\nabroad, both near and far. Seeking an effective system \r\nfor the protection of their socioeconomic rights is a \r\npriority area of our activities.\r\nOne of the most urgent problems in that area is the \r\ncontinued use of forced labour in destination countries. \r\nIn that context, we note the need to strengthen the \r\ncoordination of efforts to combat that phenomenon. \r\nWe support the programme proposed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report of 25 July (A/68/190), which \r\npoints to the need to combat human trafficking and \r\nforced exploitation. We therefore believe that greater \r\nefforts must be focused on harmful foreign employment \r\nprogrammes with a view to the organization of legal \r\nlabour migration between sending and receiving \r\ncountries. Targeted programmes are also needed to \r\nincrease training for migrants and improving related \r\nservices.\r\nWith regard to the influence of migration on \r\ndevelopment, we note the positive effect of migrant \r\nremittances on the socioeconomic development of \r\ncountries, which are also a source of support for the \r\nwelfare of many families. That must be taken into \r\naccount in the formulation of immigration policies and \r\ncritical efforts to that end. The Kyrgyz Republic pays \r\na great deal of attention to improving its policies in \r\nthat regard, including through the adoption of strategic \r\ndocuments. In early 2013, our President approved \r\na national strategy on our country’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment for the period 2013 to 2017. That policy \r\nestablishes that State policy on the labour market and \r\n13-49793 7/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nfor having organized this meaningful Dialogue. It is \r\nmy great pleasure to attend this Dialogue and share \r\nmy views on the issues of migration and development. \r\nAllow me to start by talking about the current status of \r\nforeigners in Korea.\r\nThe Korean Government was established in 1948. \r\nBy 2007 the foreign population had risen to 1 million; \r\nthis year it reached 1.6 million. In the 1960s and 1970s, \r\nKorea was a typical sending country. Recently, however, \r\nKorea has itself become a receiving country — a rare \r\nsituation.\r\nSince 2000, there has been an increasing influx \r\nof foreigners. The Korean Government realized that \r\nwe needed effective policy measures on immigration. \r\nIn 2007, therefore, the Government enacted an act on \r\nthe treatment of foreigners in Korea that allows the \r\nrelevant Government agencies to introduce five-year \r\nbasic plans on immigration policy. The second basic \r\nplan on immigration policy, which was introduced this \r\nyear, is based on five policy goals, namely, openness, \r\nsocial integration, human rights, public safety and \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe basic plan on immigration policy is also \r\nrelated to the subject of migration and development. \r\nAs demonstrated in the International Organization for \r\nMigration World Migration Report 2013, the causes of \r\nmigration are strongly related to levels of development. \r\nWith that awareness, Korea continues to strive for \r\npolicy coherence with regard to development for \r\nmigration and development. In addition, as part of \r\npursuing its basic plan, Korea is finding ways to link \r\nofficial development assistance with projects to nurture \r\nhuman resources in developing countries.\r\nHaving adopted a new policy plan linking \r\ninternational migration and development, Korea will \r\nmake every effort to achieve mutual prosperity through \r\ninternational cooperation. The Republic of Korea, \r\ntogether with other Member States, stands ready \r\nto make its contribution to the lofty goal of mutual \r\nprosperity.\r\nMr. Pires (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): At the outset, \r\nI would like to express my condolences to the families \r\nof the victims of the tragedy off the coast of Lampedusa.\r\nBrazil appreciates this opportunity to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly during this High-level Dialogue \r\naimed at identifying practical measures to improve \r\ncooperation on international migration.\r\nmigration f lows taking place along the ancient Silk \r\nRoutes.\r\nWe are convinced that the Silk Routes platform \r\nand other similar regional processes have the capacity \r\nto successfully manage migration in their respective \r\nregions. We strongly support the work of all regional \r\nmigration processes worldwide, as they are the most \r\nadequate and effective frameworks to understand, \r\nanalyse and find the best solutions to manage a given \r\nregion’s migration issues, with a view to enhancing the \r\nbenefits of international migration for migrants and \r\ncountries alike.\r\nAs I mentioned, migration has many faces. One of \r\nthe sad faces of migration becomes visible when human \r\ntraffickers take their victims along the migration routes. \r\nHungary, together with all European Union member \r\nStates, believes that all States should pay particular \r\nattention to victims of trafficking. Legal background \r\ninformation and awareness-raising campaigns are of \r\nkey importance to prevention.\r\nTo tackle all the other faces of migration as a main \r\naim in migration management, Hungary is working to \r\nbetter organize and improve the conditions for legal \r\nmigration and mobility, together with preventing and \r\ncounteracting irregular migration and facilitating the \r\nreturn and readmission of irregular migrants. Both \r\nsides need to be balanced: while Hungary welcomes \r\nlegal migrants, measures against irregular migration \r\nare used, and those violating the rules have to return to \r\ntheir countries of origin.\r\nBut what about vulnerable people who have no \r\ncitizenship? My country is proud to be party to all United \r\nNations conventions and regional conventions related \r\nto the phenomenon of statelessness and to provide \r\nprotection to those in need. Hungary has established \r\nand successfully operates a self-standing statelessness \r\ndetermination procedure. Moreover, we also act in line \r\nwith a specific quality-assurance handbook developed \r\ntogether with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees. Hungary urges all \r\nStates present here to adhere to the United Nations \r\nstatelessness conventions, as they are important pieces \r\nof the puzzle of the general, successful — but, more \r\nimportant, humane and rights-driven — management \r\nof migration.\r\nMr. Jeong Dong Min (Republic of Korea): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Republic of Korea, I \r\nwould like to express my gratitude to the United Nations \r\n8/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nThose three points correspond to our expectations \r\nof the international debate on migration, both globally \r\nand regionally. We must therefore broaden and improve \r\nthe network of treaties, norms and international \r\nstandards with regard to the treatment of human \r\nmigrantion, including undocumented migrants. There \r\nis also a need to expand the debate among institutions \r\nand to strengthen the strategic role of all international \r\norganizations dealing with this issue. Finally,  it is urgent \r\nthat we provide and improve upon regional initiatives \r\nthat are designed to allow for the direct participation of \r\norganizations that represent migrant groups.\r\nIn our view, the human rights of migrants and \r\nthe fulfilment of conditions for their full social \r\nintegration are crucial to the promotion of national \r\npolicies and regional cooperation strategies, as well \r\nas to involvement in new international mechanisms. \r\nThe human rights of migrants are a precondition for \r\nmaking global development possible. In that regard, \r\nthe Brazilian delegation reiterates its commitment to \r\nstrive to incorporate the International Convention on \r\nthe Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \r\nand Members of Their Families, which is still pending. \r\nWe support  the United Nations Global Plan of Action \r\nto Combat Trafficking in Persons. We support the \r\ninitiative of the Office of  the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees aimed at convening \r\nthe “Cartagena+30” conference. We also prioritize \r\ninitiatives based on coordination among countries \r\naimed at improving the protection and promotion of the \r\nrights of migrants against all forms of discrimination, \r\nracism and xenophobia.\r\nWith regard to promoting regional integration, \r\nmy country sponsored the recent successful efforts \r\nto expand residency and mobility rights for migrants \r\nfrom the countries of the Southern Common Market \r\n(MERCOSUR) and associated States. That was realized \r\nthrough the entry into force, in 2009, of the residency \r\nagreement concerning nationals from MERCOSUR \r\nStates parties, including its ongoing improvement \r\nwith a view towards increasingly f lexible and assisted \r\nmigration f lows.\r\nThis year, Brazil has also participated in projects \r\nto improve protective measures in cases of forced \r\ndisplacement, by expanding refugee protection, \r\nintegration and resettlement mechanisms. With \r\nBrazil’s active participation, MERCOSUR has \r\nestablished the group’s first forum of national \r\ncommittees on refugees, in an effort to set standards \r\nA tract of the history of Brazilian development can \r\nfollowed by tracing its constituent migration f lows. Our \r\nsocial plurality and our political and cultural diversity \r\nare both results and engines of that development, which \r\nare tributaries of distinct f lows of human migration.\r\nIn the course of twentieth century, the rate and \r\ntype of migration reflected the pulse of Brazilian \r\nsocial and political life. Although both migrants \r\nand Brazilians abandoned the country during — and \r\nbecause of — authoritarian regimes, the f lourishing \r\nof democracy and socioeconomic development have \r\nserved to reignite migratory trends, including of those \r\nwho set out to seek refuge and humanitarian protection.\r\nToday we are experiencing a period of reflection in \r\nterms of the Brazilian State’s response to migration. In \r\norder to generate favourable conditions for development, \r\nmigration policy must incorporate the concept of \r\ndevelopment anchored in three specific current \r\nchallenges. The first challenge is the need to update \r\nnational immigration laws, incorporate international \r\ntreaties and agreements domestically and harmonize \r\nadministrative provisions in order to establish a political \r\nand legal culture that is non-discriminatory, effectively \r\nprotects human rights and prevents violations.\r\nThe second challenge is linked to the establishment \r\nof means of coordination among migration institutions \r\nand between levels of Government — from federal to \r\nstate to local — in a country of continental proportions. \r\nIt also includes setting institutional competencies \r\nto integrate migrants in all spheres — economic, \r\nsocial, cultural and productive. This challenge should \r\nbe seen as part of a commitment to addressing the \r\nissue of undocumented migrants in an inclusive and \r\nnon-criminalizing approach and establishing specific \r\nchild-protective and gender-protective measures, with \r\ndue respect for sexual orientation and gender identity \r\nissues.\r\nThe third challenge entails making a commitment to \r\nlisten when it comes to the participation and supervision \r\nof the key social processes involved in developing and \r\nimplementing policies and programmes aimed at the \r\nmigrant groups and populations living in Brazil — a \r\nnatural extension of Brazil’s perspective concerning \r\nthe development of public  policy on the basis of \r\ntransparency, openness and social collaboration. That \r\nalso means turning on its head the paradigm whereby \r\nmigration management is a way to effect population \r\ncontrol, and instead empowering migrants through their \r\nown voices, autonomy and participation as a citizens.\r\n13-49793 9/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nour country as their homeland brought with them \r\ntechnical and specialist knowledge that had a positive \r\nimpact not only in achieving economic progress but \r\nalso progress on other equally important fronts, such \r\nas the social, cultural and scientific dimensions. That is \r\nwhy we support migrants’ access to the labour markets \r\nof host countries. We also urge the strengthening of \r\nthe international legal framework and its established \r\nmechanisms to guarantee the effective protection of \r\nthe rights of those workers and their families. And \r\nwe promote the adoption of policies to ensure respect \r\nfor, and the recognition of, the need to establish fair \r\nand decent working and social security conditions for \r\nmigrants.\r\nAlmost half of the migrants today are women. \r\nThe emigration of mothers and wives has had a strong \r\nimpact on families and societies in countries of origin. \r\nIn host countries, women are doubly the victims of \r\ndiscrimination — as women and as migrant workers. \r\nTherefore, States should protect their rights and those \r\nof other groups in vulnerable situations, such as \r\nunaccompanied minors who, for various reasons, find \r\nthemselves outside their own countries.\r\nParaguay renews its commitment to the \r\nimplementation of international obligations adopted \r\nwith a view to preventing, prosecuting and punishing \r\ntrafficking in persons and the unlawful smuggling of \r\nmigrants. We are in the process of addressing, righting \r\nand restoring the rights of victims of such crimes. We \r\ntherefore believe that it is pertinent to include as a \r\ncentral theme of the multilateral dynamics on matters \r\nrelating to migration the question of unlawful practices, \r\nwith a view to encouraging the cooperation needed to \r\nfight such practices. Similarly, we urge compliance \r\nwith the provisions of the Palermo Protocol.\r\nThus far, 47 States, including Paraguay, have \r\nratified the International Convention on the Protection \r\nof the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of \r\nTheir Families. We appeal for additional States to do the \r\nsame, thereby joining the efforts to achieve the fullest \r\nprotection of the rights of all human beings, regardless \r\nof whether they are in their own country or outside it.\r\nIn Paraguay, we have a migration policy that is \r\nbased on respect for human rights. In that context, \r\nperiodic rounds of migration-status regularization take \r\nplace in compliance with commitments emanating from \r\nnational, regional, bilateral and unilateral instruments, \r\nsuch as the migration amnesty law in force in my \r\ncountry.\r\nand share best practices in the region. Moreover, we \r\ndeveloped our second national plan against trafficking \r\nin persons. During the same period, important steps \r\nwere taken so that the International Organization for \r\nMigration could officially establish an office in Brazil \r\nas an important interlocutor on current and future \r\nefforts. \r\nWe are aware of our share of responsibility and \r\nsolidarity in relation to new migration f lows, in \r\nparticular with regard to South-South migration and \r\nmigration caused by environmental changes.\r\nLastly, we would like to highlight the launch \r\nof a national process of social listening and public \r\nconsultation. The first national conference on migration \r\nand refugees, to be held in 2014, will be an opportunity \r\nto promote social dialogue and invite migrants residing \r\nin Brazil to participate in and contribute to the \r\nelaboration of a public policy approach to migration, \r\none that has a solid human rights-based framework.\r\nThose are the guidelines by which Brazil is willing \r\nto work diligently and steadily, together with all Member \r\nStates and all related international organizations, in a \r\ncoordinated way, to make the best use of the potential \r\nbenefits and reciprocal links between migration and \r\ndevelopment, with due attention to social justice and \r\nparticipation. Together, we will thereby increasingly \r\nforge a concept of global citizenship.\r\nMr. Arriola (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): I should \r\nfirst like to express the solidarity and condolences of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay in connection with the tragedy \r\nthat occurred off the Italian island of Lampedusa.\r\nIt is an honour to represent Paraguay at his \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Migration and \r\nDevelopment, which seeks to consider the issue of \r\ninternational migration with a view to establishing \r\nhuman dignity-based channels of cooperation.\r\nThe human rights of migrants merit the fullest \r\nrespect, regardless of immigration status. Migrants \r\nand their families should be protected from acts of \r\nxenophobia and discrimination. Accordingly, receiving \r\ncountries should promote policies that aim at achieving \r\nintegration, coexistence, tolerance and social inclusion \r\nfor immigrant groups, with a view to maximizing the \r\npositive impact in host societies.\r\nParaguay views migrants as genuine agents of \r\ndevelopment. Our own history has shown that the \r\nmen and women born in other countries who chose \r\n10/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nwhether to migrate or not, facilitates the free movement \r\nof human beings, does not consider any human being \r\nto be “illegal” and advocates the principle of universal \r\ncitizenship. Ecuador firmly believes that the only way \r\nof resolving our problems and differences in the various \r\ntypes of migration policies is through frank, sincere and \r\nopen dialogue that allows us to improve the situation \r\nand quality of life of the entire migrant population, \r\nespecially those from the South to the North.\r\nWhile in developed countries there is increased \r\nfocus on security issues with respect to migration, \r\nunder the apparently neutral mantra of migration \r\nmanagement that emphasizes the effects of migration, \r\nthe subject is de-politicized, with asymmetries being \r\nignored and international obligations left out. In \r\ncontrast, in the South, our migration policy approach \r\nis based on respect for, and the centrality of, human \r\nrights and sociocultural, economic and political rights, \r\non the basis of migratory governance spaces, with an \r\nemphasis on the causes of migrations that are closely \r\nlinked to the unequal development between the South \r\nand the North.\r\nI would stress that for Ecuador dialogue is the \r\npath to peace that can resolve all differences wherever \r\nthere is political will. We have all gathered here at \r\nthe General Assembly to think about the post-2015 \r\nmigration and development agenda. We believe that \r\nthe equation is missing a third element — rights. There \r\ncan be no development without rights. That is why, for \r\nEcuador, an essential step in our future agenda and \r\ndialogue should be based on a commitment by the main \r\nhost countries of our migrants to sign the International \r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \r\nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families. \r\nAlmost 25 years have elapsed since the opening for \r\nsignature of the Convention, which to date has been \r\nsigned and/or ratified mainly by the countries of the \r\nSouth of the planet.\r\nIn various summits, we have stressed the fact that \r\nit is essential to ensure the effective enjoyment and \r\nprotection of the rights of all migrants. But Ecuador \r\nalso considers it absolutely essential to exchange ideas \r\nand opinions — for that is how we can understand \r\nthe technical and political space — on that already \r\nclassic equation of migration and development and \r\nask ourselves who benefits from migration and why it \r\noccurs.\r\nThe dominant discourse ignores the structural \r\ncauses of migration. Sometimes we do not want to \r\nIn addition, Paraguay offers assistance to our \r\nown nationals who wish to return home, providing \r\nthe necessary conditions to ensure their reinsertion in \r\nterms of education, jobs and social matters. We also \r\nmaintain close links with Paraguayan communities \r\nabroad, including victims of the trafficking in persons, \r\nfor whom we have various programmes and social \r\nfunds covered by our national budget.\r\nThe nexus between migration and development \r\ngoes beyond the merely economic perspective. We \r\nneed to adopt a holistic approach for dealing with that \r\nlink that incorporates the human, social, cultural and \r\nenvironmental dimensions, with priority attention \r\nbeing given to the relationship between migration and \r\ndevelopment. That link, contrary to popular belief, \r\nis not confined to remittances or private f lows of \r\nfunds, which, it should be emphasized, should not be \r\nconsidered to be official development assistance.\r\nMoreover, my country is of the view that the \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development requires \r\nan integral, methodological and structural review \r\nthat raises the profile of the full participation and \r\ncontribution of all of our countries. Also, we believe \r\nthat the global debate on human mobility calls for a \r\nholistic approach that moves towards the formulation \r\nof binding standards-setting instruments, policies \r\nand institutional environments that reflect a genuine \r\ncommitment by the international community to the \r\neffective implementation of the measures adopted. The \r\ndiscussion should be centred in the United Nations, since \r\nit is the natural forum, and therefore the appropriate \r\ncontext, for the participation on equal footing of all of \r\nStates.\r\nFinally, Paraguay offers and pledges its fullest \r\nsupport to carrying forward a broad-based political \r\ndebate within the United Nations on all dimensions of \r\ninternational migration, leading to the adoption of a \r\nbinding multilateral instrument.\r\nMr. Ramírez (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, Ecuador echoes the condolences expressed in \r\nconnection with the recent tragedy off the coast of \r\nLampedusa.\r\nEcuador is a country where there exist the four \r\ncharacteristics of international migration. We are a \r\ncountry of emigration and a country of immigration, \r\nand many of those migrants are refugees. We are a \r\ncountry of transit and of return. On the basis of our \r\n2008 Constitution, Ecuador defends the right of \r\n13-49793 11/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\none of the global megatrends of our time. At the same \r\ntime, discussions on the post-2015 development agenda \r\nhave triggered a new and very timely interest in the \r\ninterlinkage of migration and development, particularly \r\nin how migration can be harnessed to achieve better \r\ndevelopment. That relationship is multifaceted and \r\ncomplex, and more thorough analysis is required to \r\nobtain a clearer picture of the way migration and \r\ndevelopment can influence each other. We hope that \r\nthis Dialogue will provide an impetus for substantial \r\ndiscussions, effective follow-up meetings and, finally, \r\nconcrete results.\r\nAustria would particularly like to thank the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM) for \r\nits contribution to the High-level Dialogue. Ever since \r\nthe first High-level Dialogue meeting, in 2006, IOM \r\nmembership has consistently grown, which in itself is \r\nevidence of its success. With its wealth of experience, \r\nexpertise and knowledge, the IOM, as the world’s \r\nleading organization in the field of migration, is \r\nuniquely placed to enrich this debate in the years to \r\ncome. We would therefore like to encourage all the \r\nrelevant United Nations organizations, as well as other \r\norganizations and stakeholders in the field of migration, \r\nto cooperate. Enhancing cooperation, particularly \r\nby sharing experiences and best practices, is crucial \r\nto developing a more coherent global approach to \r\nmigration and development.\r\nIn my country’s view, it is interesting that the latest \r\nWorld Migration Report 2013: Migrant Well-Being \r\nand Development, rather than focusing on economic \r\nindicators for development, very much stresses the \r\nindividual migrants as the main focus of the debate and \r\nof analysis, as well as the question of how far various \r\nfactors can influence migrants’ well-being, which is \r\nexactly what this debate should be all about. Austria \r\nwould also like to acknowledge the important role that \r\nthe Global Forum on Migration and Development has \r\nplayed since its inception as a platform for dialogue and \r\nfor the exchange of good practices among stakeholders.\r\nI would now like to say a few words about our \r\npriorities, one of which is fighting abuse. However, on \r\nbehalf of my country, I would first like to add my voice \r\nto the condolences that have been expressed by other \r\nspeakers in connection with the recent tragedy in the \r\nMediterranean — and not only for that one tragedy, \r\nbecause there has been a long series of such tragedies, \r\nand most of them, unfortunately, are in one way or \r\nanother a consequence of abuse.\r\nremember that most migrants — asylum-seekers, \r\nrefugees and displaced persons — come from \r\ncountries devastated by violence, national disaster \r\nor conflict, whose intrinsic cause can be located in \r\ndeepening underdevelopment and the perverse effects \r\nof capitalism. The dominant view on migration and \r\ndevelopment emphasizes only one side of the problem. \r\nIt is stated that migrants contribute by their remittances \r\nto raising the standard of living in many parts of the \r\nworld, while in the countries of destination they exert \r\npressure on the labour markets, take jobs from locals \r\nand become burdens on the State through their demand \r\nfor social and other public services. Meanwhile, the role \r\nof migrants in the dynamic of creating capital in the \r\ncountry of destination is ignored. In our view, which is \r\nsupported by academic studies, the main contribution of \r\nmigrants is found to be in the countries of destination, \r\nnot in the countries of origin.\r\nIn conclusion, therefore, Ecuador reiterates that the \r\nissue of migration must be dealt with in a cross-cutting \r\nway and incorporated in the United Nations system in \r\na comprehensive and functional manner. The approach \r\nto migration policies has to be elaborated through the \r\nparticipation of civil society and migrants, leading to \r\npublic policies that allow a dignified life and decent jobs \r\nfor migrants and promote transnational citizenship. We \r\ncriticize the hardening of migration policies not only \r\nbecause it f louts the fundament rights of migrants but \r\nalso because it encourages various types of irregular \r\nmigration, trafficking in persons and other unlawful \r\npractices. We urge the main countries of destination to \r\nformulate permanent regularization programmes.\r\nThis problem cannot be solved by fences, walls \r\nor barriers that jeopardize the lives of millions of \r\nhuman beings — women, men, children and young \r\npeople — from the poorest corners of the world. \r\nThe problem is structural in nature and demands a \r\nnew international economic order that envisages the \r\ndemocratization of the international system and reduces \r\nsocial inequalities and economic asymmetries between \r\ncountries. If we all work hand in hand and have the \r\npolitical will for it, a new world is possible.\r\nMs. Tichy-Fisslberger (Austria): Austria would \r\nlike to be begin by saying that we align ourelves with \r\nthe statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion and its member States.\r\nI would also like to stress that this High-level \r\nDialogue is taking place at an important moment in time. \r\nWith 230 million international migrants, migration is \r\n12/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nproblem-oriented approach to greater recognition of \r\nthe contribution of migration to poverty reduction and \r\ndevelopment. We are aware that remittances constitute \r\na significant proportion of gross domestic product in \r\nmany countries and, according to the World Bank, \r\namounted to more than $500 billion in 2012. Knowing \r\nhow important it is, the Austrian Ministry of Finance \r\ntherefore supports the World Bank’s remittances \r\nprogramme by financing studies and disseminating \r\ninformation.\r\nThose are some of the concrete projects that we \r\nconsider necessary in order to harness migration for \r\ndevelopment. Our hope is that this forum, like those \r\nbefore it, will lead to many more concrete projects, all \r\nof which will help to enhance the nexus of migration \r\nand development.\r\nMs. Southern (Australia): Australia would also \r\nlike to express its condolences to the families and \r\ncompatriots of those lost at sea en route to Lampedusa \r\ntoday. That is a scenario we know too well, with \r\nhundreds of lives lost in recent years through dangerous \r\nmaritime ventures to Australia.\r\nAustralia welcomes the opportunity to be \r\nhere today at the second High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. We are a \r\nnation of migrants. Since 1945, more than 7.2 million \r\npeople have migrated to Australia, and nearly half of \r\nall Australians were either born overseas or have one or \r\nboth parents born overseas. The fact that approximately \r\n60 per cent of current population growth stems from \r\nnet overseas migration is indicative of the significant \r\nrole that migration plays in shaping Australia. While \r\nours is just one story, we recognize that the features \r\nof global movement are increasingly complex in terms \r\nof direction, motivation and duration, and that requires \r\nthoughtful policy responses.\r\nThe World Migration Report 2013: Migrant \r\nWell-Being and Development of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration (IOM) refers to four \r\nmigration pathways — between north and south in both \r\ndirections, north to north and the growing trend of south-\r\nsouth movement. The challenges and opportunities \r\nencompass complex people movements, with drivers \r\nranging from economic needs to crises, environmental \r\ndisasters, exploitation, criminality, persecution and the \r\nsearch for a better life.\r\nFor our part, Australia views migration as a \r\ncritical nation-building tool. We believe in robust \r\nAnother phenomenon of abuse that is becoming \r\nmore and more frequent and complex is trafficking in \r\npersons. We welcome the fact that there is a special \r\nround table dedicated to the topic. Austria is affected \r\nby human trafficking as a country of both transit and \r\ndestination, and it is obvious to us that no country \r\nby itself can counter this complex phenomenon. We \r\ntherefore stress the need for multilateral cooperation \r\nin the fight against human trafficking. Among other \r\nthings, Austria has ratified all the relevant international \r\nlegal instruments for combating human trafficking.\r\nIn that context, the human rights perspective \r\nis very important. Our policy is therefore guided \r\nby a multidisciplinary approach that encompasses \r\nmeasures for prevention, the protection of victims and \r\nprosecution. We also believe it is important to cooperate \r\nwith non-governmental organizations. Austria has \r\nconsistently supported the Human Rights Council in \r\nthis area and has been a sponsor of all the relevant \r\nresolutions on fighting human trafficking. However, if \r\nwe do not tackle its underlying causes, such as poverty, \r\nthe lack of the rule of law, corruption and so forth, \r\nall efforts will remain a fight against symptoms. The \r\nprevention of human trafficking by fighting poverty \r\nand increasing human security is therefore an area of \r\nfocus for us in projects with partner countries of the \r\nAustrian Development Cooperation, which carry out \r\nvarious projects in the field. Those include, for instance, \r\na programme on return and integration in Moldova, one \r\nthat enables female migrants to choose safe routes to \r\nlabour migration in Nepal, and other similar projects.\r\nI would also like to say a few words about \r\nthe public perception of migration. In Vienna, in \r\nFebruary, Austria hosted the fifth Global Forum of the \r\nUnited Nations Alliance of Civilizations. The Forum \r\nfocused on how responsible leadership could make a \r\ndifference in shaping a new narrative for migration, \r\nintegration and mobility in the global economy. The \r\nconclusions reached highlighted the importance of \r\nenhancing education, training and data collection. \r\nAddressing myths and misconceptions about migration \r\nis an important task. Another finding was that social \r\ninclusion and integration were not always easy; on the \r\ncontrary, they are very difficult to achieve. For that \r\nreason, civil society’s participation in policy processes \r\nis critical.\r\nIn recent years we have observed a considerable \r\nchange in the way we think about the development \r\nand migration nexus. There has been a shift from a \r\n13-49793 13/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nsupport countries of first asylum and measures that \r\nstabilize secondary movement.\r\nAustralia places great emphasis on the work of \r\nthe Bali Process on People Smuggling, Trafficking in \r\nPersons and Related Transnational Crime, which we \r\nco-chair with Indonesia and which brings together \r\ncountries of origin, transit and destination. Both \r\nthe IOM and the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees are valuable partners in \r\nthe work of the Bali Process regional support office, \r\nwhich was established in Bangkok. To strengthen \r\nthe protection of vulnerable migrants and to address \r\nthe unfortunate criminal elements that exist, we urge \r\ngreater efforts in support and implementation of the \r\nTrafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants \r\nProtocols to the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime.\r\nWe need to make migration work for all countries, \r\nbut we also need to make migration work for all \r\nmigrants, the communities that receive them and their \r\ncommunities back home. We believe that safe, regular \r\nand enabling migration is the best way for States to \r\nachieve this. Strong partnerships at all levels will help \r\nus deliver that goal.\r\nMs. Annus (Estonia): It is a profound honour to \r\ntake the f loor at this timely event highlighting the \r\nimportance and interconnectedness of migration and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nEstonia fully aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the observer of the European Union, and I \r\nwould like to make some additional remarks.\r\nEstonia acknowledges the important contribution \r\nof migration in realizing the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Human mobility is a key factor for \r\nsustainable development and should be adequately \r\nconsidered in the elaboration of the post-2015 agenda. \r\nAlthough the incentives for people to leave their homes \r\ncan include a wide range of reasons with both positive \r\nand negative shades, we can all agree that migration \r\nhas been an integral part of human societies throughout \r\nhistory. In the era of globalization, we can expect that \r\nhuman mobility will only intensify.\r\nKeeping in mind the commitment to a more \r\ncoherent, comprehensive and better-coordinated \r\napproach to migration and development, we should \r\nhave two general objectives for our debate: first, \r\nreconciling ourselves with migration processes and \r\nidentifying and encouraging the positive implications \r\nmigration policies founded on a firm evidence base. \r\nOur migration programmes, both permanent and \r\ntemporary, have been developed to create targeted, \r\norderly and safe migration paths — for migrants and \r\ntheir families — that facilitate triple wins: for migrants, \r\nfor Australia and for countries of origin. Opportunities \r\nto work in Australia can support the development of \r\nnew skills and provide access to higher incomes. To \r\noptimize those benefits, Australia has actively engaged \r\nin the Group of 20 discussions to reduce the costs of \r\nremittances. We recognize that there is more work to be \r\ndone, and we are committed to that cause.\r\nWe know that the integration of migrants is the \r\nkey to a successful migration outcome. To deliver that, \r\nAustralia has benefited from partnerships with highly \r\neffective civil society organizations. Our programmes \r\nensure that migrants are best prepared for their new \r\nenvironments, that migrants’ skills and jobs are well \r\nmatched and that communities are ready with support \r\nand services.\r\nThere are other key partnerships and cooperation \r\nefforts that enable us to manage migration well. I must \r\nhighlight the importance of our partnership with the \r\nIOM. As the only international organization with a \r\nmandate centred on migration, the IOM has a unique \r\nvoice and a vital international role. Our partnership \r\nhas been a strong one for many decades. We welcome \r\nits breadth of experience in operations and depth of \r\ncommitment to treating migrants with respect and \r\ndignity.\r\nA key outcome of the first High-level Dialogue was \r\nthe establishment of the Global Forum on Migration \r\nand Development, which gave States a mechanism \r\nto foster international dialogue. Australia is fully \r\ncommitted to the Global Forum and looks forward to \r\nit taking forward the key preoccupations arising from \r\nthis second High-level Dialogue.\r\nWe are encouraged by the State-led initiative on \r\nmigrants in crises, which builds on the experience \r\nof the Libyan crisis in 2011, and the very practical \r\nresponses taken at that time. We hear the call for action \r\nby the Special Representative of the Secretary-General \r\nfor International Migration, Mr. Peter Sutherland, and \r\nstand ready to engage as the initiative progresses.\r\nWe believe that approaches premised upon regional \r\ncooperation provide enduring solutions to the complex \r\nchallenges of mixed migration f lows and the trafficking \r\nand smuggling of migrants. That includes strategies to \r\n14/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nEstonian information and communication technology \r\nentrepreneurs, is one way to tackle those challenges.\r\nWith the Assembly’s permission, I would now like \r\nto draw attention to the most vulnerable migrants, \r\nnamely, refugees and other persons in need of protection. \r\nAccording to the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees, more people in the world \r\nhave been forced to f lee from their homes this year than \r\nany other year in nearly two decades. That includes the \r\nmore than 1.5 million people who have left Syria to \r\nescape the humanitarian crisis there. The increasing \r\nf low of refugees from Syria is substantially affecting \r\nthe entire region and beyond, with a substantial impact \r\non host communities, economies, infrastructure, \r\nenvironment and security.\r\nIt is important that the international community \r\nmake coordinated efforts to assist and support migrants \r\nstranded in vulnerable situations. The protection \r\nneeds of refugees and other displaced persons should \r\nbe addressed as close as possible to their countries of \r\norigin. We need to devise development initiatives that \r\ntarget refugee communities as well as host countries \r\nand host communities. I can confirm that Estonia is \r\ncommitted to providing financial and expert support to \r\nmeet the pressing needs of the most vulnerable.\r\nFinally, I wish to remind us all that the main \r\nchallenge of the post-2015 negotiations will be to \r\nformulate and reach global agreement on a concrete and \r\nmeasurable set of development goals that keep the three \r\ndimensions of sustainability at its core and maintain a \r\nsharp focus on poverty eradication. The targets should \r\nleave no one behind and be applicable and achievable \r\nin every country.\r\nBoth the positive and negative aspects of migration \r\nmust be taken into account while discussing the \r\nsustainable development goals. In order to allow us \r\nto benefit from the positive aspects of migration and \r\nminimize the negative aspects, it must be ensured that \r\nmigration is well managed through evidence-based \r\npolicies and decision-making.\r\nMr. Fakili (Turkey): As the Chair of the Budapest \r\nProcess since 2006, Turkey has been closely involved \r\nin the global debate and international cooperation in \r\nthe area of migration management, from a security and \r\ncontrol-oriented approach to a more comprehensive, \r\nholistic concept of migration governance. Turkey \r\nis willing to further engage in the area of migration \r\ngovernance, in line with the dynamic role it is expected \r\nof migration, such as its contribution to economic \r\ndevelopment, innovation, trade and investment; \r\nand, secondly, overcoming the negative aspects of \r\ninvoluntary migration by tackling the root causes of \r\nforced migration in countries of origin.\r\nIt is the responsibility of each State to protect human \r\nrights and provide services to every person within their \r\nborders, especially the most vulnerable persons, such as \r\nwomen and children. Each State should focus on good \r\ngovernance. Supporting the rule of law, strengthening \r\nindependent judicial mechanisms, ending impunity and \r\nensuring accountability and responsive Government \r\nare some measures to take on the path to ensuring \r\nproper sustainable development for all.\r\nThe international community can provide \r\nassistance in building up the capacities and resilience \r\nof countries struggling with development challenges \r\nor being affected by adverse climate features. National \r\nownership, a determination to solve problems, good-\r\ngovernance practices and the rule of law are essential \r\nin order to make the most of international assistance.\r\nLet me also underline that, due to global population \r\ndynamics and the nature of globalized economies, labour \r\nmobility is both inevitable and welcomed. We must \r\nrespect and promote international labour standards as \r\nappropriate and respect the rights of migrant workers. \r\nWe must make a stronger effort to tackle discrimination \r\nagainst migrants and to improve public perceptions of \r\nmigrants and migration.\r\nThe challenges related to the integration and \r\nreintegration of migrants, including the adaptation of \r\nnational labour markets and systems for health care, \r\neducation and social security to increasingly diverse \r\nand interconnected societies, must be addressed. It \r\nshould be acknowledged that refugees and other persons \r\nin need of protection can present significant challenges \r\nfor some host countries and communities. It should also \r\nbe recognized that, through empowerment, migrants \r\ncan make important contributions to host communities \r\nand local and national economies.\r\nA more mobile labour force implies the increasing \r\nimportance of remittances as a significant contribution \r\nto private financing for development in migrants’ \r\nhome countries. Therefore, the conditions for cheaper, \r\nfaster and safer transfers of remittances in both \r\nsource and recipient countries should be promoted. \r\nCooperation with innovative private-sector companies, \r\nsuch as TransferWise, which was set up by young \r\n13-49793 15/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nin addition to conventional mechanisms to combat \r\nmigrant trafficking.\r\nThe fifth ministerial conference of the Budapest \r\nProcess, held in Istanbul on 19 April, brought together \r\n28 ministers and deputy ministers, 230 delegates from \r\n52 participating and observer countries, and the relevant \r\nregional and international organizations. The meeting \r\nadopted the Istanbul ministerial declaration on a Silk \r\nRoutes Partnership for Migration, which addresses \r\nmigration and development as a specific priority area, \r\nwith its goal of strengthening the positive impact of \r\nmigration on development in both countries of origin \r\nand of destination. The declaration is a strong indicator \r\nof the link between the future work of the Budapest \r\nProcess and the goals and aim of the Global Forum on \r\nMigration and Development. The Istanbul declaration \r\nhas already been referred to as one of the most balanced \r\nand far-reaching documents in the field of migration, \r\nadopted by a wide range of countries.\r\nA wide range of activities are foreseen in the \r\ndeclaration, such as mainstreaming migration into \r\ndevelopment planning and taking development issues \r\ninto account when elaborating migration policies; \r\npromoting sustainable, comprehensive, balanced \r\nand efficient policies on migration and development; \r\nensuring a multi-actor approach that includes the \r\nrelevant development stakeholders, including from the \r\npublic and private sectors, to engage in dialogue and \r\nconcrete cooperation; facilitating circular migration \r\nand active engagement in development; engaging with \r\ndiasporas to make better use of their contributions; \r\nimproving the use of monetary and social remittances \r\nfor the benefit of the sustainable economic and social \r\ndevelopment of the countries of origin; fostering \r\nsustainable reintegration; counteracting the possible \r\nnegative effects of emigration on countries of origin; \r\naddressing the gap between emergency relief, \r\nhumanitarian assistance and sustainable development; \r\nexploring and addressing development-related causes \r\nof migration; and developing and strengthening small \r\nand medium-sized entrepreneurship by migrants.\r\nThe operational cooperation foreseen in the \r\ndeclaration covers six priority areas — migration and \r\nmobility, integration, migration and development, \r\nirregular migration, trafficking in persons and \r\ninternational protection — that are all relevant to the \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Migration and Development.\r\nMr. Storr (United Kingdom): First, the United \r\nKingdom would like to echo the sentiments expressed \r\nto play in future efforts to manage migration in the \r\nEurasia region.\r\nTurkey has decided to take on the challenging \r\ntask of chairing the Global Forum on Migration and \r\nDevelopment in 2015, not only because of its increasing \r\nsignificance with respect to migration but also because \r\nof our increasing commitment to development issues. \r\nTurkey has vast experience to share in the area of \r\nmigration and development. We are in the process \r\nof determining the game plan for our chairmanship. \r\nNaturally, there is still much to do. We will assume the \r\npriorities of previous Chairs, whose work we appreciate \r\nwholeheartedly. On top of their work, we will add our \r\nown contribution.\r\nIn that context, I can announce that additional \r\npoints of concentration will be on promoting mobility; \r\ndecreasing obstacles such as visas and similar barriers; \r\nensuring the human rights of migrants and cooperation \r\nin combating illegal migration; abolishing notions \r\nof racism, discrimination and xenophobia; creating \r\ninternational mechanisms to ensure transfers of social \r\nsecurity benefits, utilizing the Turkish experience with \r\nsmall and medium enterprises — which is considered \r\none of the best means of development — as well as \r\nTurkey’s successful story of transformation from a \r\nsource country to one of destination.\r\nRecognition is the fundamental need of all \r\nmigrants. Their recognition by the countries in which \r\nthey are migrants would, first and foremost, ensure \r\ntheir access to basic services such as health, education \r\nand social security. It would also enable them to better \r\nintegrate and contribute to both the host communities \r\nand their own.\r\nGiven the fact that a holistic approach is critical in \r\nmigration management, maintaining a balance between \r\nsecurity and human rights will become a crucial aspect \r\nof Turkey’s future migration policy, which should also \r\nemphasize the needs and rights of migrants.\r\nWe believe that all aspects of migration at the \r\nnational, regional and global levels are interlinked \r\nand must not be addressed in isolation. For example, \r\nrather than considering the issue of irregular migration \r\nfrom a limited security perspective, we believe that \r\ndevelopment policies should focus on the root causes \r\ninfluencing persons towards irregular migration, so \r\nas to help find durable solutions for both sending and \r\nreceiving countries. Irregular migration can be best \r\navoided by providing mechanisms for legal migration \r\n16/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nattention to orderly, regular and safe migration, and \r\nits focus on human trafficking. On the issue of human \r\ntrafficking, we are committed to playing a full part \r\nin the fight against it. We regard it as an issue that \r\ndeserves greater political and practical priority. It is, in \r\nessence, modern slavery. That is why we work closely \r\nwith global partners to investigate and prosecute cases \r\nboth at home and abroad. It is also the reason why the \r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom is taking a long, \r\nhard look at its own legislation, to see whether there are \r\nchanges that should be made — although I should say \r\nthat the legislation currently in place conforms fully \r\nwith the Protocols to the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime.\r\nIt is also important that we support the victims \r\nof trafficking, who are among the most vulnerable \r\nmigrants. Our commitment in that regard is \r\nevident — for example, in the United Kingdom we have \r\nsupported anti-trafficking projects for girls and women \r\nin South Asia, focused on female migrants going to \r\nthe Middle East to work in the domestic-worker and \r\ngarment-manufacturing sectors. We therefore hope \r\nthat this High-level Dialogue will encourage all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to make further efforts \r\nto combat trafficking, identify its victims and, where \r\npossible, help them return to a safe and secure life in \r\ntheir country of origin.\r\nIn concluding, I would once again like to welcome \r\nthis High-level Dialogue as an opportunity to develop \r\ninternational cooperation that reflects the nature of \r\nglobal migration. In focusing on the links between \r\nmigration and development, we should be mindful of \r\nthe need for transparency and fairness within national \r\nand international approaches. And, while seizing the \r\nopportunity to enhance the benefits of migration by \r\nmanaging it properly, we should also make use of this \r\nopportunity to address its negative aspects, such as \r\nhuman trafficking, and ensure that migration policies \r\ncreate a win-win situation for all of us.\r\nMr. Châtaigner (France) (spoke in French): The \r\nreason we are here today is because we are all aware of the \r\nimportance of migration for development. Since our last \r\nDialogue, in 2006, regional and international mobility \r\nhas continued to grow. That constitutes both a challenge \r\nand an opportunity for countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination. Where the opportunities are concerned, \r\nmigration has contributed to the achievement of many \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. According \r\nto the World Bank, migrant remittances for this year \r\nby the observer of the European Commission and other \r\nspeakers in connection with the tragic events of this \r\nmorning in Lampedusa.\r\nI take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment \r\nto working constructively with our global partners. \r\nMigration and development can be addressed properly \r\nonly through international cooperation. The United \r\nKingdom believes that requires a truly global approach. \r\nLess than half of migration is now from developing to \r\ndeveloped countries. Our discussions therefore need a \r\nbroader agenda that more fully reflects that fact.\r\nA renewal of our agenda is also timely given the \r\nfact that the post-2015 development agenda is taking \r\nplace at this moment. The High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on that framework, co-chaired by United \r\nKingdom Prime Minister David Cameron, noted the \r\ncontinuing significant of international cooperation \r\nand international migration. What is less clear is how \r\nwe should take account of migration in the future \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nIn our view, the case has not yet been made out to \r\ninclude a post-2015 goal on migration, given the risk of \r\ndiluting the focus on extreme poverty. For that reason, \r\nwe believe that this High-level Dialogue should be \r\nmeasured and realistic in its recommendations in that \r\narea.\r\nThe United Kingdom also believes that any \r\nenhanced focus on migration and development must \r\ntake account of aid-effectiveness principles. Ultimately, \r\nwe believe our aim should not be about enhancing the \r\nlinks between migration and development per se, but \r\nabout enhancing effective action to deliver on partner \r\ncountries’ development priorities. If we wish to enhance \r\nthe links between migration and development, fair, \r\neffective and transparent national systems are also an \r\nessential element. In the United Kingdom, our system \r\nmanages labour migration from outside the European \r\nUnion in a way that meets labour market needs, but \r\nthat also, importantly, works for migrants themselves. \r\nIt is what we describe as a win-win situation. We are \r\nable to meet skills shortages while migrants can see \r\nfor themselves what opportunities exist to work in \r\nthe United Kingdom — and face the same qualifying \r\ncriteria irrespective of their nationality.\r\nWell-managed migration, including, importantly, \r\nreturns and reintegration, is also integral to ensuring \r\nthe benefits of migration for all. On that basis, the \r\nUnited Kingdom supports this High-level Dialogue’s \r\n13-49793 17/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nGovernment projects with migrants in order to mobilize \r\nthe diaspora and contribute to the digital integration of \r\noutlying regions. Since 2009, 92 infrastructure projects \r\nhave been financed in that way at a level of €10 million, \r\nand 262 businesses created with an investment of \r\n€3 million. Through that concrete experience, France \r\nhopes that the role of migrants in developing their \r\ncountries of origin can be fully recognized within \r\nthe framework of the sustainable development goals \r\nand within the post-2015 programme and architecture \r\nwe hope to build. How can that be done? Certainly \r\nnot by discussing specific goals, but through cross-\r\ncutting inclusion of the issue of migration in the post-\r\n2015 agenda as a whole. That could take the form \r\nof establishing specific targets linked to migration \r\nthat would apply to each major thematic goal of the \r\nforthcoming agenda: health, education, youth and \r\nemployment.\r\nThe recognition of migrants and migration in \r\nthe post-2015 agenda should also include a renewed \r\npartnership on migration issues. We are in favour of \r\npursuing international cooperation within the Group \r\nof Eight and the Group of 20 in order to increase and \r\nfacilitate financial f lows of migrants to developing \r\ncountries, and to reduce the associated costs of those \r\ntransactions, which ties in with what I mentioned \r\njust now about how important it is to include better \r\ngovernance and management of that migration on our \r\ninternational agenda.\r\nLastly, France and the other members of the \r\nEuropean Union are convinced that the protection \r\nof the fundamental rights of migrants, regardless of \r\ntheir status, must remain a cross-cutting priority in \r\nall policies. Trafficking in human beings is a f lagrant \r\nviolation of human rights and must be robustly combated, \r\nin accordance with current international standards. The \r\nsituation of migrants caught in certain crisis situations \r\nis also a matter of concern. We therefore welcome the \r\nexemplary action by the International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM) to assist such migrants in the recent \r\ncrises in Libya, Somalia, Mali and Syria. We assure the \r\nIOM of our resolute support.\r\nMr. Habib (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, let me express my delegation’s condolences to \r\nthe bereaved families of those who lost their lives this \r\nmorning off the southern coast of Italy.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Fiji on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.25).\r\nalone total $414 billion, three times as much as total \r\nofficial development assistance. Migrant remittances \r\ncan be directed to productive investment and create \r\njobs. They also serve the essential function of social \r\nprotection. Migrants bring with them not simply money \r\nand work but also ideas, standards and new practices \r\nthat transform both their countries of destination and \r\ntheir countries of origin. Their wealth, ultimately, is \r\nhuman wealth. They are people, and that is worth far \r\nmore than all the rest.\r\nWhere the challenges are concerned, the growth \r\nof South-South migration is a major development \r\nissue for countries that need to better mobilize their \r\ndomestic resources for their own development. \r\nMigration — between North and South, South and \r\nSouth, North and North — makes us all countries of \r\nimmigration and emigration. Currently, for example, \r\nthere are 1.6 million French people living outside France \r\nwho in a sense are ambassadors for our values. Aware of \r\nthe challenges of this new type of migration, France has \r\nseriously revised its migration and development policy. \r\nIts guiding principle is one of building partnerships \r\nfor development with every diaspora organization, the \r\nauthorities in partner countries, the private sector and \r\ncivil society. In a way, we are building a kind of global \r\ncivil society.\r\nThere are four complementary areas within our \r\nactivities in support of migrants’ potential for solidarity, \r\nparticularly through assisting diaspora associations \r\nand carrying out their projects; supporting migrants’ \r\ninvestment capacity by co-financing development \r\nprojects; strengthening partnership countries’ capacity \r\nto integrate mobility and migration into their national \r\nand local development strategies; and, finally, \r\ncontributing to international dialogues and the creation \r\nof knowledge, all focused on the fact that at some point \r\nwe must consider how to better manage our migration \r\nsystems.\r\nIn very specific and functional terms, France, for \r\nexample, through its development agency, has helped \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco to define its public policy \r\non supporting productive investment for the diaspora. \r\nThose investments make up only about 20 per cent of \r\ntotal remittances, but they have a very strong potential \r\nimpact on development because they respond to the \r\nState’s essential concern, which is increasing and \r\nimproving financial accessibility and creating jobs. \r\nWe have also concluded an agreement with Senegal \r\nfor the implementation a project to co-finance local \r\n18/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\ntheir relations, communications, transactions, access \r\nand transportation to the country of origin should not \r\nin any way be restricted by the destination countries. \r\nNor should they face any discrimination at all in their \r\naccess to academic education and to scientific and \r\nfinancial resources.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran remains cooperative \r\nwith all States and with the United Nations system \r\nand other relevant organizations, especially through \r\nthe offices of the United Nations Population Fund and \r\nIOM in Tehran, to meet the challenges of migration, as \r\nwell as making migration an opportunity for creating a \r\nbetter world for all in the future.\r\nMs. Tapley (Canada): Canada extends its \r\nappreciation to the Office of the President. I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for convening this \r\nsecond High-level Dialogue on International Migration \r\nand Development.\r\nMuch has happened in our global community \r\nsince the High-level Dialogue in 2006. The world is \r\nincreasingly characterized by globalization not only of \r\nthe economy but also in terms of the mobility of people \r\nat an unprecedented pace, magnitude and complexity, \r\nwith impacts in many areas, including development. \r\nWe are virtually all countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination for international migrants. As members \r\nof the international community, we increasingly share \r\nnot only our successes but also our challenges in \r\nnational, regional and international efforts to harness \r\nthe benefits of migration for States and migrants alike. \r\nCanada shares the view that migration is a process to be \r\nmanaged, not a problem to be solved.\r\nAllow me to highlight three overarching issues that \r\nare of interest to Canada in international migration and \r\nits links to development. First is the important role we \r\nhave as individual countries and as an international \r\ncommunity to promote safe, orderly and managed \r\nmigration. Second is the importance of expanding our \r\nability to work individually and collectively at all levels \r\nand to maximize the development impacts and other \r\nbenefits of migration while addressing key challenges. \r\nThird is the importance of better leveraging existing \r\nglobal and regional forums and partnerships to make \r\nmeaningful progress towards those ends.\r\nDrawing on our experience with immigration, \r\nCanada has long advocated safe, legal and orderly \r\nmigration as the most effective way to harness the \r\nbenefits of migration while addressing its challenges. \r\nHistorically, Iran, an ancient civilization, was at \r\nthe heart of the famous Silk Road connecting the West \r\nand the East by linking traders, merchants, pilgrims, \r\nmonks, soldiers, nomads and urban dwellers from \r\nthe Far East to the far West during various periods of \r\ntime. Its geopolitical position provided Iran a unique \r\nopportunity to contribute to international migration as \r\nthe bridge between East and West.\r\nToday, with 232 million international migrants in \r\nthe world, migration has increased in volume, scope, \r\ncomplexity and impact since the adoption in 1994 of the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development. It is an intrinsic \r\nfeature of a globalizing world in which economic, \r\nsocial, demographic, political and environmental \r\nfactors all should be considered in assessing the effects \r\nof international migration on sustainable development \r\nand in identifying relevant priorities in view of the \r\npreparation of the post-2015 development framework.\r\nAt the national level, the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nhas established the High Council of Iranians Abroad in \r\nthe presidential office. It offers services to all Iranian \r\nmigrants, including those who are highly educated and \r\nskilled and thus play an important role in their host \r\ncommunities all over the world.\r\nWe urge destination States to avoid imposing any \r\nlimitations on contacts between migrants and their \r\nStates of origin. That is especially important with \r\nregard to migrants who are highly educated and skilled. \r\nContinuing contact between them and their States of \r\norigin could contribute to the transfer of knowledge \r\nand skills and accelerate the development of developing \r\ncountries.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has been an active \r\nmember of the International Organization for Migration \r\n(IOM) for more than a decade. We have had joint \r\ninitiatives with the IOM on disseminating knowledge \r\nof international migration law in Tehran since 2007. \r\nWe have jointly established and run with IOM an \r\nimportant programme on international migration and \r\ndevelopment, funded by the Government of Japan, \r\ncalled Return and Reintegration of Qualified and \r\nSkilled Afghan Nationals from the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran shares with many \r\ncountries the view that highly skilled and educated \r\ninternational migrants can play an important role in \r\nthe development of their countries of origin; hence, \r\n13-49793 19/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nand we need to ensure that each of those voices is given \r\nthe opportunity to develop and to be heard.\r\nCanada is pleased to continue to engage actively in \r\na number of regional consultative processes, as well as \r\nin the Global Forum on Migration and Development, \r\nwhich is an important forum to exchange practices, \r\npromote collaboration on practical issues and, \r\nultimately, build trust and partnerships.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada’s ultimate goal is to reach, in the framework \r\nof this High-level Dialogue, an exchange that builds on \r\nour shared accomplishments and on the work of many \r\nimportant actors in international migration, especially \r\nsince the earlier High-level Dialogue. We are confident \r\nthat this Dialogue will provide a platform to guide us \r\nin moving forward constructively on concrete issues of \r\nshared interest.\r\nMr. Amanbayev (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian): I \r\nwould like to inform the Assembly of the measures that \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan has undertaken to regulate \r\nmigration processes, including labour migration issues.\r\nToday questions of population migration, \r\nspecifically labour migration, are becoming more \r\npressing for countries in the Central Asian region, \r\nincluding the Republic of Kazakhstan. Russia and \r\nKazakhstan host the largest numbers of migrants in \r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). In the \r\nCentral Asian States, more than 90 per cent of migration \r\nis interregional in nature and occurs among the \r\nformer Soviet republics. The Republic of Kazakhstan \r\nis developing modern and necessary procedures to \r\nregulate those processes within the country in order to \r\nensure that the rights and interests of foreign migrants \r\nare observed and that they are provided with decent \r\nwork opportunities.\r\nIn 2011 the Republic of Kazakhstan adopted a \r\nmigration law under which immigrants — including \r\nforeigners and stateless persons who enter Kazakhstan \r\nfor temporary or permanent residence — are recognized. \r\nIn that law we have defined labour migration and \r\ncreated norms to regulate it, including a quota for \r\nlabour migration for different categories of the foreign \r\nwork force.\r\nUp to 2011, Kazakhstan gave migrant permits \r\nonly to employers, but now we are working to \r\nencourage small businesses to open. We are providing \r\nspecial work permits. Most immigrants coming from \r\nTo be effective in meeting the needs and expectations \r\nof migrants and societies alike, migration needs to be \r\nmanaged.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThis High-level Dialogue is an opportunity to \r\ntake stock of our efforts in the field of international \r\nmigration and its links with development; to move \r\nforward on concrete issues that support development \r\nand promote, protect and respect the human rights of \r\nmigrants; and to enhance their well-being and ability to \r\ncontribute to their host and home countries.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada is interested in exploring further, with \r\npartners, innovative approaches that complement and \r\nstrengthen the efforts of Governments to ensure safe \r\nand orderly labour migration and the protection of the \r\nhuman and labour rights of migrants, including through \r\nethical recruitment practices.\r\nThe issue of remittances is an important one for \r\nCanada. We will continue to work with the Group \r\nof 20 (G-20) to consider innovative, results-based \r\nmechanisms to further reduce the cost of transferring \r\nremittances to developing countries.\r\nCanada will continue to support the sharing of best \r\npractices and efforts in capacity-building at various \r\nlevels in migration management, immigrant integration \r\nand the protection of the human rights of migrants. We \r\nwill also support a deepened effort for greater data and \r\nevidence on the links between international migration \r\nand development.\r\nTo be successful in the global dialogue, it is \r\nimportant that we continue to engage interested \r\nstakeholders at all levels, to focus on concrete issues \r\nof mutual interest that lend themselves to practical \r\npartnerships, and to improve implementation and \r\ncoordination of existing frameworks and mechanisms \r\nto deliver real outcomes.\r\nCanada is pleased with the pragmatic approach \r\nthat the International Organization for Migration and \r\nrelevant United Nations bodies have been taking to \r\naddress a number of these issues, and in that regard we \r\nwelcome the strong support of the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General for International Migration, \r\nwhose role has been important for the progress we have \r\nmade since 2006. We value the contribution of civil \r\nsociety and the private sector to this practical dialogue, \r\n20/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nWe adopted the Agreement on the Legal Status \r\nof Migrant Workers and Members of their Families in \r\n2010. In accordance with the Agreement, we eliminated \r\nprocedures requiring work permits created by countries \r\nto protect their domestic labour markets. In fact, we can \r\nsay that cooperation has been established to coordinate \r\nthe migration processes between countries in the region. \r\nWe are working intensively with them on those issues. \r\nI must also mention the support of United Nations and \r\nthe International Organization for Migration, which are \r\ndirectly involved in resolving policy issues on labour \r\nmigration. Kazakhstan greatly appreciates those efforts \r\nby international organizations.\r\nMr. Yeganyan (Armenia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to join previous speakers in commending the \r\nPresident for presiding over this plenary meeting and \r\nthanking the Secretary-General and other speakers for \r\ntheir statements. We praise the Government of Mexico \r\nfor its valuable contribution to the High-level Dialogue.\r\nArmenia is a nation challenged by migration. \r\nIt is the most recent signatory to the International \r\nConvention on the Protection of the Rights of All \r\nMigrant Workers and Members of Their Families. \r\nThe Government has identified the management of \r\nmigration processes as one of its priority directions, \r\nand tangible improvements have been made within the \r\nlast three years. The Concept for the Policy of State \r\nRegulation of Migration of the Republic of Armenia, \r\nwith 14 priority areas, was adopted, and an action plan \r\nfor 2012-2016, containing 147 concrete activities, was \r\nintroduced for its implementation.\r\nTo reduce the negative consequences of emigration \r\nfrom Armenia, my Government has taken significant \r\nsteps in establishing strong ties with a number of key \r\npartners. Besides its growing cooperation with the \r\nEuropean Union, it has signed the mobility partnership \r\ndeclaration and visa facilitation and readmission \r\nagreements. Today, eight migration projects — at a cost \r\nof €9 million — are being implemented in Armenia \r\nwith European States on both bilateral and multilateral \r\ncooperation platforms.\r\nAs approximately 80 per cent of Armenia’s \r\nemigrants are in the countries of the Commonwealth \r\nof Independent States (CIS), the country is actively \r\ninvolved in integration processes in the region. \r\nCoordinated action is under way to establish a joint \r\nlabour market and manage population movements in \r\naccordance with an agreed policy, as highlighted during \r\nneighbouring countries end up working for the private \r\nsector, and that is why we are planning to allow \r\nindividuals to hire foreign workers. We have defined \r\na new category of immigrants — business immigrants, \r\nthose who have come in particularly with the idea of \r\nbeing entrepreneurs. We have enabled them to obtain \r\npermission to work and have included them under the \r\nnew law, as they were not specifically addressed under \r\nthe previous law. There are also simplified means of \r\nattracting foreign workers in the new law.\r\nWe underscore that Kazakhstan, the republics \r\nof Central Asia, Russia and other CIS countries have \r\na unified migration system. We note that a labour \r\nimmigration policy can succeed only if there is a \r\ncoordinated effort on the part of all the countries of the \r\nregion to carry out a joint policy. We have established \r\nthat type of cooperation.\r\nIn 2007 the States members of the CIS created a \r\ncouncil of the institutions regulating immigration, \r\nwhich is functioning successfully today. For seven \r\nyears now we have been meeting twice a year to discuss \r\ncurrent issues of labour migration. At those meetings \r\nthere are information exchanges and general trends are \r\ndiscussed, as are problems in immigration policies. We \r\nactively cooperate to assist legal migration and to bring \r\nand end to illegal migration.\r\nLast year Kazakhstan signed the concept of the \r\nCIS member States’ common migration space. It \r\nrepresents an agreed position to create and strengthen \r\na shared intergovernmental policy on migration in the \r\nregion. Strategic areas in the concept include creating \r\nfavourable conditions for movement of the labour force \r\nand ensuring equal treatment for migrant workers, \r\nwidening the channels of legal employment for them and \r\nenhancing the effectiveness of inter-State cooperation \r\nin managing migration processes. Kazakhstan intends \r\nto continue that work in the framework of the CIS. \r\nFrom our side we want to contribute to strengthening \r\nthe institutions and mechanisms of migration in order \r\nto achieve socioeconomic stability in the region.\r\nMoreover, today we are not limiting ourselves to \r\nthe CIS. Regulatory problems and the regional labour \r\nmobility issues are being raised during meetings of \r\nthe customs union and the unified economic space. \r\nFurther economic integration in the region is posing \r\nnew questions related to migration and to respect for \r\nthe rights and interests of labour migrants, which is \r\nleading us to new, joint decisions.\r\n13-49793 21/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nwww.backtoarmenia.com enables returnees to \r\nestablish direct contact from abroad with the relevant \r\ngovernmental institutions in Armenia through \r\nelectronic communications, including Skype, and to \r\nreceive prompt and reliable feedback with respect to \r\ntheir inquiries.\r\nWe believe that the measures targeting return and \r\nreintegration carried out by various countries would \r\nhave been more effective if the international community \r\nhad taken a more active role in various matters, such as \r\nthe implementation of return projects aimed at highly \r\nqualified specialists residing outside the country of \r\norigin, the creation of conditions for directing migrant \r\nremittances to sectors of the economy and the broad \r\napplication of circular migration schemes.\r\nArmenia welcomes the draft declaration that has \r\nbeen adopted and strongly believes that the Dialogue \r\nwill do much to support further implementation of \r\nthe goals involving migration and development at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels and will help \r\nto set the stage for the post-2015 development agenda \r\nwith a focus on the issue.\r\nMr. Carrillo (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, we express our condolences over the unfortunate \r\nevents in Lampedusa, Italy. I also extend to the \r\nAssembly the warmest greetings of the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Panama, in particular of the President \r\nof the Republic, Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, and of the \r\nPanamanian delegation and myself.\r\nWith respect to the issues of migration and \r\ndevelopment before the Assembly today, I am \r\npleased to report to those present that my country is \r\ndealing with those issues. The document on the topic \r\n(A/68/190) puts the number of migrants worldwide \r\nat 232 million — hence the necessity of formulating \r\npolicies to appropriately manage migration.\r\nThe National Migration Service and the Ministry \r\nof Labour have, in recent years, issued executive orders \r\nto amend, extend and repeal provisions in order to bring \r\nprocedures for the issuance of new visas for migrants \r\nand work permits into line with international norms.\r\nPanama has introduced visas and work permits \r\nbased on a humanistic approach, which we consider \r\nimportant. For example, family reunification is now \r\nrecognized as a basis for the admission of foreigners \r\nwith Panamanian children. Permanent residency status \r\nhas been granted to many foreigners who were not \r\nthe CIS conference on labour migration as a factor of \r\ndevelopment in the CIS, held in June, in Moscow.\r\nArmenia considers highly important the issues \r\nconcerning the return and reintegration of its citizens \r\nfrom abroad and the utilization of the diaspora’s \r\npotential as a key element in the country’s migration \r\nand development agenda. The Armenian diaspora \r\nrepresents a unique phenomenon, as more than two \r\nthirds of Armenians worldwide reside outside the \r\nRepublic of Armenia. Currently, there are Armenian \r\ncommunities in almost every country of the world. The \r\ntraditional diaspora was formed mainly as a result of \r\nthe Armenian genocide of 1915. In the past 20 years, \r\nthe diaspora has been enriched by Armenian emigrants \r\nwho left Armenia owing to socioeconomic hardship.\r\nThe Armenian Government has adopted a policy \r\nof strengthening the ties between the motherland and \r\nthe diaspora by promoting the latter’s cultural identity \r\nand maintenance of national traits and utilizing the \r\ndiaspora’s potential to develop the Armenian economy. \r\nThe steps taken to achieve those goals may be of \r\ngreat interest to other countries. Pursuant to the 2006 \r\namendments to the Constitution, foreign citizens of \r\nArmenian descent have the right to obtain citizenship of \r\nthe Republic of Armenia through a simplified procedure. \r\nThe All-Armenian Fund was established in 1992. The \r\nFund has branches in more than 40 countries. All-\r\nArmenian global conferences, Pan-Armenian Games, \r\ncultural festivals and other events aimed at bringing \r\ntogether specialists of like professional background are \r\norganized on a regular basis. The establishment of the \r\nMinistry of Diaspora in 2008 provided a new impetus \r\nto the activities carried out with regard to the diaspora.\r\nState policies regarding Armenian citizens residing \r\nabroad have mainly focused — since the early 1990s — on \r\npromoting their return and sustainable reintegration. In \r\nthe development context, it should be underscored that \r\nreturning migrants possess new knowledge and skills, \r\nnew business ideas and fresh multicultural perceptions, \r\nall of which are particularly important to Armenia. That \r\nis why supporting such returns is one of the priorities of \r\nthe Armenian Government’s migration policy.\r\nThe issues of return and reintegration are both \r\nincluded in the international cooperation agenda. \r\nCurrently a consortium composed of eight European \r\ncountries, headed by the French immigration and \r\nintegration office, is implementing a long-term \r\nproject dealing with the two issues. The web page \r\n22/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\n“We leave behind a legacy of social and political \r\nstability, sustained high economic growth \r\nthroughout the Latin American region, and we have \r\nhelped to promote and build the common welfare of \r\nthe Panamanian nation” (A/68/PV.8, p. 6).\r\nMr. Pérez Walker (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\ninitiative represented by this Dialogue is becoming \r\nincreasingly pressing, given the growing levels of \r\ninternational migration, and addressing the topic in a \r\nmultilateral forum enables us to adopt decisions that \r\nreflect the global character of migration in a consistent \r\nand coordinated manner. That is why I am pleased that \r\nthe United Nations, a good example of multilateralism, \r\nis the forum for these deliberations over the mobility \r\nof people and their rights, something that has \r\nbeen expressed repeatedly by the South American \r\nConference on Migration. The United Nations is \r\nthe appropriate place to make any decisions about \r\naddressing international migration.\r\nFurthermore, the International Organization for \r\nMigration (IOM), deserves special mention. It has \r\nplayed an important role, both as an intergovernmental \r\norganization specializing in migration and by \r\nhelping prepare this second High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development. The IOM has \r\nalso been involved in the South American Conference \r\non Migration. In that regard, we request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to set up a working group of no more than nine \r\ncountries, so as to speed up the process and make it \r\nmore viable, in order to analyse and come up with new \r\nmechanisms to address the scope and challenges of \r\nmigration, thereby improving the interaction between \r\nthe United Nations and the IOM.\r\nIn the past 20 years, the migration landscape has \r\nchanged, both globally and regionally. South-North \r\nmigration is no longer the dominant pattern, and \r\ntrends that were emerging during the course of 2006 \r\nhave increased and strengthened. The expansion of \r\nSouth-South migration and North-South migration \r\nnow reflects the new face of international migration. \r\nIn that context, Chile, as a middle-income country with \r\na per capita gross national product of around $16,000, \r\nhas become an emerging magnet for migrants in recent \r\nyears. It went from being a country of origin to one \r\nthat meets the dual nature of a country of origin and \r\ndestination for migrants.\r\nSince 2006 and in relation to that recent evolution, \r\nChile has sought to address those challenges and take \r\npreviously so entitled. Transient and temporary workers \r\nare now issued visas for one year — double the prior \r\nsix-month period — and such visas can be extended for \r\na further five years.\r\nFurthermore, a special visa and work permit has \r\nbeen created for professionals who wish to reside \r\npermanently in the Republic of Panama and contribute \r\ntheir knowledge and experience to further the country’s \r\neconomic, cultural and social development.\r\nI wish also to draw attention to Panama’s \r\nadministrative efforts to support the international \r\ncommunity, at a time when some economies are \r\nexperiencing labour pressures. Accordingly, our \r\nGovernment has not only extended the range of \r\navailable visas and work permits but also called for \r\nthe establishment of special procedures to regularize \r\nmigration status by addressing fundamental issues of \r\nthose foreigners who are not eligible for any migration \r\nstatus under the country’s current migration legislation.\r\nMigration campaigns, of which 12 have been held \r\nsince they were launched in 2010, have made it possible \r\nfor over 35,000 foreigners, of 80 nationalities, whose \r\nmigration status was irregular to be granted temporary \r\nresidence for two years and a work permit for the same \r\namount of time. For those who sign up for it the second \r\ntime, the provisional residence permit can also be \r\nextended for ten more years.\r\nI am happy to inform the Assembly that, at this \r\nmoment, we are holding the twelfth extraordinary day \r\nfor legalizing migrants, what we have called “Panama, \r\nthe melting pot”. We hope to grant 10,000 additional \r\ntemporary visas to undocumented migrants. It is also \r\nvery important to emphasize that giving immigrants \r\nthe opportunity to obtain legal status and work permits \r\nnot only benefits our country in terms of security \r\nand the economy, but migrants themselves are then \r\nincorporated into the social security, banking and \r\nlabour systems, preventing them from falling victim to \r\nexploitation and allowing them to offer their families \r\na decent standard of living. I am sure that with the \r\nparticipation of everyone here today, we will manage \r\nto have a positive exchange of ideas and good practices, \r\nwhich will benefit the international community and \r\nimprove the quality of life of our brothers and sisters.\r\nAs the President of the Republic of Panama, \r\nRicardo Martinelli, said in a statement he gave at the \r\nGeneral Assembly:\r\n13-49793 23/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nOn a global scale, Chile has promoted the process \r\nthat was guided by the High-level Dialogue in 2006, \r\nactively participating in meetings of the Global Forum \r\non Migration and Development. In that same vein, \r\nChile also chaired a high-level dialogue between the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(CELAC) and the European Union (EU) on migration, \r\nseeking to build a space for dialogue and joint work on \r\nthe challenges of migration between the two regions.\r\nTo acknowledge the joint work done by the two \r\nregions and bearing in mind the importance of updated \r\ndata and objective information on international \r\nmigration, Chile has developed the first CELAC-EU \r\nstatistical digest on migration. Once again, the IOM can \r\nbe given credit for that work, as well as the Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nFinally, at the regional level, Chile chaired the \r\nrecent South American Conference on Migration and \r\nhas hosted meetings and consultation processes on \r\nthe South American region. Since the last meeting in \r\n2012, Chile has helped define a common position for \r\nthe South American region in the lead-up to the second \r\nHigh-level Dialogue.\r\nThe result of those efforts is embodied in the \r\nBuenos Aires Declaration, which presents the position \r\nof the South American countries in terms of addressing \r\nand monitoring migration at the global level. Needless \r\nto say, in terms of monitoring, Chile has promoted \r\nthe drafting and subsequent ratification of a global \r\nconvention on international migration that seeks to \r\nshape a global consensus with minimum standards on \r\nmigration and its global governance.\r\nMr. Lutenco (Republic of Moldova): Let me first \r\nexpress condolences to the families of those who lost \r\ntheir lives on the way to Lampedusa. Moldova knows \r\nvery well the tragedy of families and human lives that \r\nwere destroyed by migration.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express appreciation \r\nfor the fact that the United Nations attaches such great \r\nattention to the issue of migration. That shows the \r\ndetermination of Member States to cope with it in the \r\nbest possible way, through partnership and dialogue.\r\nLike other countries, the Republic of Moldova \r\nhas grown aware of the important opportunities that \r\nmigration brings but has also learned to react wisely to \r\nthe challenges it poses. In the light of the very complex \r\nimpacts on Moldova, a composite response mechanism \r\nbecame necessary with an extended partnership base \r\nadvantage of the opportunities offered by migration, \r\nincorporating migration issues and the needs of migrants \r\ninto the Government’s public agenda. The basis for \r\naddressing international migration in our country lies \r\nin an undiminished respect for the human rights of \r\nmigrants and their families, as exemplified by Chile’s \r\nratification of the main international instruments on \r\nmigration, which include the International Convention \r\non the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers \r\nand Members of Their Families, as well as the \r\nSmuggling of Migrants Protocol. Chile has therefore \r\npromoted efforts to manage migration, seeking a \r\ncomprehensive approach to international migration \r\nthrough a multisectoral institutional administrative \r\nstructure, such as a council for migration policy and an \r\ninterministerial committee on the Chilean community \r\nabroad.\r\nMeanwhile, in order to promote the principle of legal \r\nresidency, which ensures that migrants can exercise \r\ntheir full human rights within their host community, \r\nChile has implemented procedures to make migrants \r\nlegal through legal initiatives aimed at modernizing the \r\ncountry’s immigration laws. That is based on the belief \r\nthat a status of residency that has been regularized and \r\nis in accordance with the law would in turn ensure the \r\nintegrity of migrants and the social and labour rights of \r\nChilean nationals.\r\nIn terms of applying the principles of human rights \r\nand governance at the national level, Chile has been \r\nupdating the normative framework on migration with \r\nthe enactment of a law on the protection of refugees and \r\na law on human trafficking, especially of women. Chile \r\nhopes that that will lead to a more cohesive society. \r\nFurthermore, we are currently discussing in Congress \r\nthe new bill on migration and immigration, which \r\nseeks, by creating a council on migration policy and \r\na migration division, to update the legal framework, \r\nadapting it to the changing needs of the country and to \r\nthe requirements of the migration process.\r\nForeigners who, for a number of reasons, have \r\ndecided to settle in Chile must be able to rest assured \r\nthat their nationality will not be detrimental to their \r\nstatus. In that regard, compared to current regulations, \r\nthe bill is a step forward, in that it underscores explicitly \r\nthe terms and conditions of equality relating to the \r\nrights of migrants in general, listing the privileges that \r\nare appropriate and describing the minimum amount of \r\nprotection that can be guaranteed for those who remain \r\nin the country without any legal status.\r\n24/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nplanning has become an important field of activity \r\nfor us. We have adopted systemic changes with long-\r\nlasting effects and a whole-Government approach. \r\nAccordingly, in all the ministries and State agencies, \r\na deputy minister is responsible for migration and \r\ndiaspora affairs. The migration and diaspora impact \r\nhas been introduced ex ante into all new public policies \r\nin order to estimate the potential impact of migration \r\non our citizens abroad, and special instruments have \r\nbeen devised to create a migration impact checklist.\r\nRegional cooperation is fundamental to the \r\nmanagement of migration. One of our Government’s \r\npriorities is the establishment of bilateral agreements \r\nand a cooperation framework at the regional level. The \r\naim of those agreements with neighbouring countries \r\nis to reinforce measures for social protection, mutual \r\nhumanitarian assistance, employment, respect for \r\nhuman rights of migrants and more. The Republic of \r\nMoldova has established more than 20 such bilateral \r\nagreements. It is committed to further advancing that \r\npractice.\r\nThe Moldovan Government reaffirms the \r\nimportance of migration in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and considers that further steps should be taken \r\nto diminish the negative effects of migration through \r\nthe implementation of more efficient policies.\r\nDialogue has proved to be a useful instrument to \r\nhelp achieving those goals, and we hope that it will be \r\ndiversified and enhanced in future.\r\nMr. Wiredu (Ghana): Let me first express my deep \r\ngratitude on behalf of the Government of Ghana to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for organizing the second High-level \r\nDialogue on International Migration and Development. \r\nI am grateful for this opportunity to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe issues that are engaging our attention during \r\nthe Dialogue are of relevance to global and national \r\ndevelopment, whether they have to do with national \r\nplanning, human rights or policy decision-making, \r\namong other matters. History has fine examples \r\nof the immense contributions of migrants to the \r\ntransformational development, peace and security \r\nof great nations. It is on account of the significance \r\nof migration to global and national development \r\nthat Ghana actively participated in the first General \r\nAssembly High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development and is also participating in \r\ntoday’s dialogue. The objectives and expected outcomes \r\nto address the international core of the migration \r\nprocesses. That motivated us to be the pilot country \r\nin implementing the European Union (EU)-Moldova \r\nmobility partnership and to actively participate in \r\nthe work of the Global Forum on Migration and \r\nDevelopment. In that context, the partnership proved \r\nto be the key element for strengthening sustainable \r\ndevelopment and consolidating the efforts of all the \r\nactors — a dimension that should be further enhanced \r\nat the regional and global levels.\r\nThe experience of about five years of \r\nimplementation of the mobility partnership — during \r\nwhich 89 projects and initiatives have been or are \r\ncurrently under implementation — has strengthened \r\nour cooperation and relationship of trust with the EU \r\nand EU member States and has had a direct positive \r\nimpact on prospective migrants, current migrants and \r\nreturnees.\r\nWe are ready to continue and to deepen our \r\ncooperation with the EU and to share our experience \r\nwith anyone who is interested. Moreover, the evaluation \r\nof our work is also available. The evidence-based \r\nmigration policymaking is crucial for the State and \r\nindividuals. Moldova recently completed its first \r\nextended migration profile, incorporating it into the \r\ninternal statistical monitoring system, where, by \r\nconducting periodic household surveys and cooperating \r\nclosely with destination countries, we are able to \r\nbetter monitor and manage migration f lows. Shortly, \r\nthe diaspora profiles of main destination countries \r\nfor migration from Moldova will be available for a \r\nwide range of uses, from better assisting migrants in \r\nvulnerable situations to better attracting and guiding \r\ninvestment.\r\nIt is our strong belief that improved data exchange, \r\nfirst of all between countries of origin and destination, \r\ncould be of significance in recording the migration \r\nexperiences of specific individuals. The representative \r\nof the Russian Federation mentioned in his statement \r\nearlier today (see A/68/PV.25) that the authorities know \r\nby name all migrants who have broken Russian law. \r\nHaving access to that type of information would, for \r\nexample, allow Moldova to better inform its citizens \r\nand provide the necessary legal assistance that will \r\nbe beneficial to the two States, but most of all to the \r\nindividuals concerned.\r\nCertainly migration is a high priority on \r\nthe development  agenda of my country. Thus, \r\nmainstreaming migration and development in national \r\n13-49793 25/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Integration \r\nto mainstream the Ghanian diaspora in national \r\ndevelopment. In collaboration with the relevant public-\r\nsector institutions, the Diaspora Support Unit aims \r\nat providing, through its website and social media \r\nplatforms, a one-stop shop to facilitate the dissemination \r\nof information, applications for dual citizenship, \r\nremittance transfers, investments, trade, registration of \r\ncompanies, labour mobility and reintegration.\r\nGhana recognizes the global character of \r\ninternational migration and affirms that international \r\nmigration is a phenomenon growing in both scope and \r\ndiversity. Ghana, for its part, believes international \r\nmigration could be a positive force for development, in \r\nboth countries of origin and countries of destination, \r\nprovided that it is supported by the right set of policies. \r\nUnder the Ghana shared growth and development \r\nagenda for 2010 to 2013, efforts have been made to \r\nestablish a comprehensive institutional framework \r\nfor the management of migration, to harmonize \r\nregistration, to develop a comprehensive database, and \r\nto build the human and technical capacity of migration \r\ninstitutions for better migration management.\r\nIn pursuit of those ideas, the Migration Unit of the \r\nMinisty of the Interior is coordinating efforts to bring \r\nthe policymaking process to its logical conclusion. A \r\ndraft national migration policy is before the Cabinet \r\nof Ghana for consideration and, if approved, to be \r\nsubmitted to Parliament for the necessary legislative \r\nbacking. That draft policy envisages, among other \r\nthings, the establishment of a national migration \r\ncommission to be responsible for both internal and \r\nexternal migration.\r\nWith regard to policy initiatives and measures, it \r\nis important to state that Ghana’s national population \r\npolicy contains significant elements on migration. The \r\n2010 national population census captured relevant issues \r\non migration to aid policy formulation. It is noteworthy \r\nthat the Ghana immigration service has adopted a \r\nlong-term strategy plan for the implementation of its \r\ninstitutional mandates. In that connection, the service \r\nhas established the Ghana Migration Management \r\nBureau with three divisions. The first focuses on \r\ncombating the trafficking and smuggling of persons \r\nthrough the adoption of an operational plan to ensure \r\nGhana’s compliance with minimum international \r\nstandards. Secondly, the Migration Information \r\nBureau is to cap irregular migration and promote legal \r\nmigration through information-gathering, creating \r\nof the Dialogue are, in our assessment, of relevance in \r\noptimizing the development gains to be derived from \r\nmigration, while minimizing the negative impacts.\r\nThere are a number of possible engagements on \r\nthe international scene, such as promoting circular \r\nmigration and visa facilitation to optimize the gains \r\nof migration, as well as readmission agreements and \r\nvoluntary repatriation packages to reduce the pain of \r\nreintegration. Circular migration has increasingly been \r\nheralded by policymakers as a solution to transform \r\ninternational migration into a win-win-win situation, \r\nwhere a nation can successfully meet its labour \r\nmarket needs, while also increasing benefits through \r\nremittances and know-how. Migrants themselves can \r\nraise their standard of living without leaving their \r\nfamilies on a permanent basis.\r\nHowever, some of the terms of such agreements \r\nmake it difficult for developing countries to take \r\nadvantage of circular migration. Ghana is both a \r\ndestination and an origin country for international \r\nmigration, with an estimated 3 million Ghanaians in \r\nthe diaspora. In turn, the migrant populations include a \r\nsignificant number of citizens and economic migrants \r\nbelonging to members of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States, this being a result in part of \r\ncivil wars and several political security post-conflict \r\nsituations, as experienced by Ghana’s immediate \r\nneighbouring States, including Liberia, Sierra Leone, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Mali and the Niger.\r\nGhana reaffirmed its commitment to the governance \r\nof international migration when the Government \r\ndecided to subscribe to the International Convention on \r\nthe Protection of All Migrant Workers and Members of \r\nTheir Families, aimed, inter alia, at protecting the right \r\nof migrant workers to dignity and the due processes of \r\nlaw. Ghana has also recently ratified the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime \r\nand its supplemental Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren.\r\nAs a country, Ghana remains focused on promoting \r\nand protecting the interests and welfare of our \r\ncompatriots abroad through our diplomatic missions \r\nand consulates. To help our nationals to be able to \r\ncontribute immensely to the national development \r\nagenda, in August 2012 Ghana established a Diaspora \r\nSupport Unit, with technical assistance from the \r\nInternational Organization for Migration (IOM), as \r\na cross-cutting multistakeholder unit coordinated \r\n26/27 13-49793\r\nA/68/PV.26 03/10/2013\r\nthe preparedness of the United Nations system to face \r\ncurrent and future challenges associated with migration \r\nand to optimize development benefits.\r\nThe High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development is a very important \r\nmultilateral process on migration. It is noteworthy \r\nthat the first High-level Dialogue, in 2006, gave birth \r\nto the Global Forum on Migration and Development, \r\nwhich has now become a very useful forum in which \r\nto discuss the important issues pertaining to migration \r\nand development.\r\nThe subject is very important to my country. Sri \r\nLanka ratified the International Convention on the \r\nProtection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and \r\nMembers of Their Families in 1996. Sri Lanka was \r\nelected to the 14-member Committee on Migrant \r\nWorkers in 2009 and again in 2013.\r\nFor Sri Lanka, circular employment migration \r\nhas become a very crucial phenomenon. Out of a \r\ntotal population of 20.3 million citizens, an estimated \r\n1.7 million are employed overseas as contract workers. \r\nThis is 21 per cent of the country’s economically active \r\nlabour force. Moreover, Sri Lankans employed abroad \r\nremitted a total of $6.1 billion during 2012, which \r\namounted to 35 per cent of the total foreign exchange \r\nearnings. Needless to say, at this present time, that \r\nis a very important source of foreign income for the \r\ncountry. A very important facet of this migration is that \r\nthe earnings from employment abroad f lowed into the \r\nremotest areas of Sri Lanka. In many instances those \r\nearnings have become more effective than development \r\naid at alleviating poverty.\r\nIn Sri Lanka, 49 per cent of employed migrants \r\nare female. The protection of female migrant workers \r\nand their children left behind is at the core of the \r\nGovernment’s policy framework on migration. In that \r\nconnection, the Government recently decided to obtain \r\na family background report on all migrant mothers \r\nprior to their departure. This is to ensure that a stable \r\narrangement is in place for the protection and well-\r\nbeing of the children they leave behind. Sri Lanka \r\nhas also established an association with an island-\r\nwide network called Rata Viruwo, meaning “heroes \r\noverseas”, with the next of kin of every migrant worker \r\nbeing a member, to look into the welfare needs of the \r\nfamilies left behind.\r\nPlans are now under way to increase the skilled \r\nlabour force for the overseas job market in Sri Lanka. \r\npublic awareness and educating on the dangers of \r\nillegal migration and on opportunities for legal \r\nmigration. The third division is a refugee section that \r\ncollaborates with the Ghana Refugee Board, the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nand the IOM to provide protection for refugees and the \r\nimplementation of the Government secession policy on \r\nthe local reintegration policy of refugees.\r\nAs a developing country, Ghana concurs with the \r\ncommunity of nations on concerns about the increase \r\nin illegal migration and the exploitation and abuse of \r\nmigrants in irregular situations. In recent times, Ghana \r\nhas recorded several cases of abuse and violations of \r\nthe human rights of Ghanians who are recruited to some \r\nArab Gulf countries to work as domestic servants. We \r\nurge the international community to continue its efforts \r\nin combating trafficking in persons and the smuggling \r\nof migrants, especially women and children, at the \r\nnational, bilateral, regional and global levels. It is of \r\ninterest to mention that in July 2012 the Parliament of \r\nGhana enacted legislation that criminalizes migrant \r\nsmuggling, which grossly dehumanizes the dignity of \r\nthe individual.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating that Ghana is \r\nwilling and ready to partner with the United Nations \r\nand other organizations such as the IOM and the Global \r\nMigration Group to continue addressing international \r\nmigration and development issues.\r\nBefore I resume my seat, I wish to take the \r\nopportunity to say that Ghana joins countries across \r\nthe globe in conveying its deepest condolences to the \r\nfamilies of those lost in the tragedy in the Mediterranean \r\nSea this morning. May the souls of the perished rest in \r\npeace.\r\nMr. Wijeratne (Sri Lanka): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered earlier \r\nby the Minister of Defence, National Security and \r\nImmigration of the Republic of Fiji on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.25)\r\nThe adoption of the Declaration (resolution 68/4) \r\nthis morning is a significant step in mainstreaming \r\nmigration and development in the global development \r\nagenda. I, too, congratulate the delegation of Mexico \r\nfor conducting consultations on the draft declaration, \r\nand I acknowledge the contribution of all States to \r\nthat forward-looking document. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/68/190) on the theme contains \r\nvaluable information for all stakeholders and outlines \r\n13-49793 27/27\r\n03/10/2013 A/68/PV.26\r\nthe ILO helped us develop the national labour migration \r\npolicy in 2008, for the first time in South Asia.\r\nOn 3 and 4 December 2013, Sri Lanka will host \r\na regional dialogue in collaboration with UN Women \r\nto develop a standard employment contract for female \r\nmigrant domestic workers. Senior officials from labour-\r\nsending countries in Asia and receiving countries \r\nin the Middle East will attend this dialogue with the \r\nexpectation of reaching a consensus.\r\nSri Lanka reiterates its commitment to advancing \r\nall relevant international conventions on migration. \r\nHowever, we strongly believe in the need for a more \r\neffective mechanism to monitor the implementation \r\nof those conventions by both countries of origin \r\nand destination countries. As a member of the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nSri Lanka will contribute to the Group’s work to duly \r\nrecognize migration as one of the priority areas of the \r\npost-2015 global development agenda.\r\nWe look forward to making the living and working \r\nconditions of all migrants safe and decent.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\nMany Government-sponsored initiatives aim to develop \r\nthe skills of women and youth who are potential \r\nmigrants to suit overseas markets.\r\nAs the host country of the World Conference on \r\nYouth in 2014, Sri Lanka welcomes the theme of \r\nInternational Youth Day 2013: “Youth Migration: \r\nMoving Development Forward”. In addition to the \r\ncommon development challenges facing youth all \r\nover the world, especially those living in developing \r\ncountries, we recognize that migrant youth have specific \r\nissues. The Conference on Youth will focus on how to \r\nmainstream the youth perspective in internationally \r\nagreed development goals. We welcome the engagement \r\nof stakeholders to reiterate the importance of migration \r\nand development.\r\nWe are working closely with the International \r\nOrganization for Migration (IOM) and other United \r\nNations agencies on projects related to migrants. The \r\nIOM provides technical assistance to train officials in \r\ncharge of immigration, border security and the welfare \r\nof migrants. The IOM also assisted us in establishing \r\nthe National Centre for Migration Statistics in the \r\nDepartment of Census and Statistics in 2008. Similarly, \r\n"
