"The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development\r\nAgenda item 18\r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the 2008 Review Conference\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will \r\nconvene the sixth High-level Dialogue on Financing \r\nfor Development, which is held in accordance with \r\nAssembly resolutions 67/199 of 21 December 2012 and \r\n67/300 of 16 September 2013, and takes place under \r\nagenda item 18, “Follow-up to and implementation \r\nof the outcome of the 2002 International Conference \r\non Financing for Development and the 2008 Review \r\nConference”.\r\nThe overall theme of the sixth High-level Dialogue \r\nis “The Monterrey Consensus, Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development and related outcomes of \r\nmajor United Nations conferences and summits: status \r\nof implementation and tasks ahead”. The Dialogue \r\nwill consist of plenary meetings, three interactive \r\nmulti-stakeholder round tables and an informal \r\ninteractive dialogue. A detailed programme is contained \r\nin the Journal of the United Nations.\r\nI will now make a statement.\r\nI am pleased to welcome participants to this High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Financing for Development. I wish \r\nto extend a special welcome to ministers, high-level \r\nrepresentatives and senior officials from Member \r\nStates, development, financial and trade institutions, \r\nand civil-society and private-sector participants.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 67/300, the overall \r\ntheme of this Dialogue is “The Monterrey Consensus, \r\nDoha Declaration on Financing for Development and \r\nrelated outcomes of major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits: status of implementation and tasks \r\nahead”. This two-day event will include a series of \r\nplenary meetings and round-table discussions.\r\nThe Dialogue takes place at a time when three \r\nsignificant United Nations intergovernmental processes \r\nrelating to sustainable development, the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and financing for development \r\nare about to converge. To allow us to meet those \r\nmilestones, financing — more specifically, financing \r\nfor development — is the elixir — the lifeblood, if you \r\nlike — that we need.\r\nOur dialogue provides an opportunity to explore a \r\nnumber of key issues in detail, including the impact of \r\nthe world financial and economic crisis on the reform \r\nof the international monetary and financial system \r\nand its implications for development, and the steps \r\nthat have been taken to address vulnerabilities in the \r\nfinancial sector and their implications for development. \r\nOther key issues include the means for implementing \r\na sustainable development agenda beyond 2015; the \r\nmobilization of public and private financing, including \r\nforeign direct investment and other private f lows; \r\nand fostering international trade and sustainable debt \r\nfinancing in the context of financing for development. \r\nFurther key issues to be explored are the complementary \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.29\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n29th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 7 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In turn, this has \r\nmeant a narrowing of fiscal space for investments \r\nin areas that are critical in achieving the MDGs and \r\nfinancing sustainable development activities in the \r\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions.\r\nWe are a little more than two years away from the \r\n2015 target date to meet the MDGs. Here at the United \r\nNations, we are about to embark on a transformative \r\nexercise aimed at developing and subsequently \r\nimplementing a post-2015 development agenda. \r\nNow more than ever, it is imperative that countries \r\nkeep the pledges and commitments they have made, \r\nincluding meeting the ODA objective of 0.7 per cent \r\nof gross national income. That is one way to ensure \r\nthat acceleration of the MDGs will lay the ground \r\nfor a strong post-2015 United Nations development \r\nagenda, inclusive of sustainable development goals, as \r\nwe agreed at last year’s United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development in Brazil.\r\nOur post-2015 development agenda must of \r\nnecessity be a unified agenda and will require a \r\ncoherent financing strategy for its implementation. It \r\ntherefore follows that such a strategy will need to build \r\non existing international agreements, as enshrined in \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration, and its \r\nsuccessful implementation will need global cooperation \r\nin the form of multi-stakeholder partnerships among \r\nGovernments, the private sector and civil society.\r\nWe will also need to address today’s challenges, \r\nincluding climate change, food security and financial \r\nstability; respond to new and emerging challenges \r\nand opportunities; and be both dynamic and f lexible. \r\nAny new framework will require greater coherence \r\nand consistency across various United Nations \r\nintergovernmental processes, including those \r\nrelating to sustainable development and financing \r\nfor development, so as to enable us to answer the \r\nfollowing key questions: how can the financing for the \r\ndevelopment process help shape the post-2015 United \r\nNations development agenda, and how can the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development be integrated \r\ninto one financing framework?\r\nImplementing the post-2015 development agenda \r\nwill require significant resource mobilization, and \r\nalthough initial estimates of financing needs for \r\nroles of private and public financing and mobilizing \r\ndomestic and international resources for development, \r\nand the role of financial and technical development \r\ncooperation, including innovative sources of \r\ndevelopment financing, in leveraging the mobilization \r\nof domestic and international financial resources for \r\nsustainable development.\r\nOver a decade has passed since world leaders \r\nadopted the Monterrey Consensus to provide a \r\nfinancing framework to help in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Specifically, \r\nthe Consensus sought to “eliminate poverty, improve \r\nsocial conditions and raise living standards, and protect \r\nour environment”.\r\nDuring our recent high-level week in the general \r\ndebate, we heard that much has been achieved since the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) was adopted \r\nin 2000, followed by the Monterrey Consensus in 2002. \r\nYet much remains to be done. Progress in reaching \r\ndevelopment goals has been uneven among and within \r\ncountries, and new challenges have emerged. The \r\ninternational community will need to accelerate efforts \r\nto mobilize financial resources towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015 and to pave \r\nthe way for the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nWith fewer than 825 days remaining before the \r\ntarget date for the MDGs, work is under way on the \r\npreparation of a post-2015 development agenda, with a \r\nview to integrating the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. At the same time, we need to develop \r\nan integrated financing framework that builds on the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development, while also addressing new \r\nand emerging challenges.\r\nThe recent global financial and economic crisis and \r\nits aftermath reminded us of the significant fragilities \r\nthat remain in the international financial system. \r\nMany advanced economies, especially in the euro \r\narea, continue to experience sovereign debt problems, \r\nbanking fragility and fiscal pressures. Economic \r\nactivity in developing countries has also been adversely \r\naffected, partly due to spillovers from economic \r\nweakness in developed countries, as well as structural \r\nproblems in their own domestic economies.\r\nAmong the consequences of the weak and fragile \r\nstate of the global economy are continuing high levels \r\nof unemployment and underemployment across the \r\nworld and a slower pace of poverty reduction. What \r\n13-50226 3/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nthem to this High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. In 2002, world leaders gathered in \r\nMonterrey, Mexico, for the International Conference \r\non Financing for Development. Together, they helped \r\nput in motion a bold new partnership for development.\r\nMore than a decade later, we find ourselves at \r\nanother important juncture. The end of the year 2015 \r\nwill soon be upon us, and we must spare no effort to meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals by that deadline. \r\nAt the same time, we are working on a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment framework containing a single set of goals \r\nwith sustainable development at its core. The financing \r\nneeded to meet these challenges will be significant. It \r\nwill require a robust framework, including both public \r\nand private resources.\r\nI am deeply concerned about the recent decline \r\nin official development assistance (ODA). For many \r\ndeveloping countries, and in particular the most \r\nvulnerable, predictable levels of ODA remain critical. I \r\nencourage all countries to fulfil their pledges and meet \r\ntheir ODA targets, including through the principles and \r\nactions set out in the Busan Partnership for Effective \r\nDevelopment Cooperation.\r\nHowever, we know that international public finance \r\nwill not be sufficient to build a more sustainable and \r\nprosperous world. Financing and investment from \r\nthe private sector will play an increasingly vital role. \r\nThe public sector can help leverage private resources \r\nand encourage long-term investment. Domestic \r\npublic finance, including broadening the tax base and \r\nimproving tax administration, remains crucial and \r\nrepresents the commitment of national ownership of \r\nGovernments for their own development agenda. We \r\nmust join forces to eliminate illicit financial f lows, \r\nenhance the regulation of secrecy jurisdictions and \r\npromote asset recovery.\r\nSouth-South and triangular cooperation is also \r\ngrowing and now encompasses many important \r\nareas, including infrastructure investment, technical \r\ncooperation, research and development and \r\ninformation-sharing.\r\nLooking ahead, we must put sustainability at the \r\ncore of the financing for development process. We \r\nhave high expectations for the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing, which will propose options for a strategy \r\nto facilitate the mobilization and use of resources. The \r\nfinancing for development process, with its wide range \r\nsustainable development are of necessity imprecise, \r\nstudies conclude, without exception, that they are \r\nextremely large. While the fulfilment of all ODA \r\ncommitments remains critical, it is clear that the \r\nfinancing needs will outpace public sector resources \r\nin many countries. The good news is that estimated \r\nfinancing needs represent only a relatively small portion \r\nof global savings. The broader challenge, however, lies \r\nin promoting a financial system that can stimulate the \r\nreallocation of a small percentage of global savings \r\ntowards sustainable development.\r\nAs enshrined in the Monterrey Consensus and Doha \r\nDeclaration, both private and public financing from \r\ndomestic and international sources will be necessary. \r\nThe effective mobilization of domestic public resources \r\nwill ultimately come from sustained domestic growth, \r\nwhich in turn depends on strong domestic institutions, \r\neffective macroeconomic policymaking, sustainable \r\ndebt financing and a fair international trading system. \r\nIt will also require good governance, including the \r\nelimination of corruption and waste.\r\nNew and innovative sources of financing will be \r\nneeded to supplement traditional ODA, and South-\r\nSouth cooperation will need to be further enhanced as a \r\ncomplement to North-South and triangular cooperation \r\nin order to provide greater opportunities for sustained \r\neconomic growth.\r\nFinancing for development is critical for the \r\nexpeditious achievement of the MDGs and for laying \r\nthe groundwork for a strong post-2015 United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda with sustainable development \r\ngoals at its core. This unified agenda will require \r\none financing strategy that builds on the agreements \r\nenshrined in the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration and creates an enabling environment \r\nfor delivering the relevant means of implementation, \r\nparticularly finance, technology and capacity-building.\r\nThis two-day High-level Dialogue provides a \r\ntimely opportunity to assess the issue of financing for \r\nsustainable development in an integrated manner and \r\nin the context of the post-2015 development process. \r\nLet us ensure that this Dialogue provides an important \r\nmilestone in our common quest for sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Ban Ki-moon.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I thank members and \r\nothers here today for their participation and welcome \r\n4/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nprogress in our quest to achieve the MDGs. Several \r\ntargets have been met already; all will be met by 2015. \r\nEven the poorest countries have achieved significant \r\ngains. Yet progress is insufficient and uneven among \r\nand within countries. The global financial and \r\neconomic crisis caused serious setbacks, highlighting \r\nthe continued presence of systemic weaknesses in the \r\nglobal financial and monetary system. As we approach \r\n2015, we must strengthen our efforts to accelerate \r\nprogress towards achieving the MDGs. That has also \r\nset the stage for an ambitious sustainable development \r\nagenda beyond 2015.\r\nThe future development agenda has to be \r\nunderwritten by a strong financing framework and \r\na renewed and strengthened global partnership for \r\ndevelopment, building on the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development. \r\nSuch a framework can provide a strong foundation for \r\nsecuring sustainable development globally.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council plays an \r\nimportant role in advancing the financing for \r\ndevelopment agenda. In 2013, we held a number of \r\nimportant discussions to assess different options and to \r\ndebate a renewed and strengthened global partnership \r\nfor the post-2015 development agenda. A number of \r\nkey messages emerged from those meetings. Most \r\nimportantly, a renewed partnership must build on the \r\nstrength of MDG 8 and the current partnership as set \r\nout in the Millennium Declaration, the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. It should take into account all existing \r\ncommitments on development finance but also respond \r\nto changes in the global environment and the new \r\nchallenges that have emerged.\r\nIn April this year, we held the annual Special High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the Economic and Social Council \r\nwith the Bretton Woods institutions, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development. We discussed financing options \r\nfor a post-2015 sustainable development agenda as one \r\nits main topics. That was followed by an Economic \r\nand Social Council panel discussion on financing for \r\nsustainable development at the July session in Geneva.\r\nThose discussions emphasized that strengthening \r\nthe financing for development strategy is a key priority \r\nfor the international community as it proceeds in \r\nformulating a new sustainable development agenda. In \r\nview of the extremely large financing needs, all sources \r\nof financing — domestic and external, private and \r\nof stakeholders and important contributions from civil \r\nsociety, remains a distinctive platform for cooperation \r\nand coordination.\r\nAs we work together to formulate our vision, \r\nprinciples, goals and targets for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, let our efforts be firmly rooted \r\nin a sound financing strategy based on mutual \r\naccountability and shared responsibilities. We are all \r\naware of the constraints on finance today, and yet the \r\nsuccesses of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nother development initiatives clearly show that smart \r\ninvestments will make a lasting difference in the \r\nlives of families, communities and societies. A strong \r\nfinancial commitment to human solidarity today will \r\nimprove prosperity and security tomorrow.\r\nTogether, let us take the spirit of Monterrey into a \r\nnew era and come together for a more sustainable planet \r\nand a life of dignity for all. I thank the Assembly for \r\nits commitment to these goals and wish it a productive \r\nmeeting.\r\nThe President: I would like to remind members \r\nthat, pursuant to its resolution 67/300, of 16 September \r\n2013, the Assembly decided that the modalities of this \r\nDialogue will be the same as those described in its \r\nresolution 65/314, of 12 September 2011.\r\nI now give the f loor to Mr. Masood Khan, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Pakistan to the United \r\nNations, who is also Vice-President of the Economic \r\nand Social Council.\r\nMr. Khan (Pakistan), Vice-President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council: It is a great honour for \r\nme to address the General Assembly’s sixth High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development.\r\nA lot has been achieved since the adoption of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration in the \r\nmobilization of domestic and international resources, \r\nincluding official development assistance (ODA), in \r\nadvancing international trade and managing external \r\ndebt, and in enhancing the coherence and consistency \r\nof the international monetary, financial and trading \r\nsystems in support of development.\r\nThe financing for development process also \r\nprovides a financing framework for achieving the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and gives \r\nspecificity to the global partnership for development \r\nembodied in MDG 8. We have witnessed remarkable \r\n13-50226 5/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nagenda beyond 2015. The Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration remain major reference points in \r\ninternational development cooperation.\r\nAs we elaborate our new development agenda in \r\nthe months ahead, we have to ensure coherence and \r\nconsistency between the financing for development \r\nprocess and the formulation of the means of \r\nimplementation for sustainable development goals. \r\nThe report of the Intergovernmental Committee of \r\nExperts on Sustainable Development Financing to be \r\npresented in a year’s time should build on Monterrey \r\nand Doha and present us with options for an effective, \r\nsustainable development financing strategy. I am \r\nconfident that our deliberations over the next two days \r\ncan bring important insights towards formulating a \r\nfinancing framework and a strengthened partnership \r\nfor sustainable development in a new global context. I \r\nwish all of us a fruitful discussion in a cooperative and \r\nproductive spirit.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Mr. Mukhisa \r\nKituyi, Secretary-General of the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development.\r\nMr. Kituyi (United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development): It is a great pleasure for me to \r\naddress the sixth High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and to offer a few brief thoughts on the \r\nstate of implementation of the Monterrey Consensus \r\nand, more important, suggestions for the way forward.\r\nAfter years of neglect, the Monterrey Conference \r\nput development finance firmly back on the multilateral \r\nagenda. And yet, we are all aware of the slow progress \r\nthat has been made since then. As mentioned by the \r\nother speakers this morning, five years after the global \r\ncrisis, financing for development is diminishing across \r\nthe board. Public debts have been mounting. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance declined to approximately \r\n$126 billion in 2012, and is under further downward \r\npressure. In the same year, developing countries saw \r\nthe growth of their exports slow down to approximately \r\n3.8 per cent and an actual 4 per cent decline in foreign \r\ndirect investment inflows, to $703 billion. Only \r\nremittances, standing at approximately $375 billion \r\nin 2012, have seen a mild increase, but these f lows \r\nstill need to be channelled better into productive \r\ninvestments.\r\nWhile the supply of development finance is \r\ndiminishing, the needs are growing. In addition to \r\nthe existing needs to fully achieve the Millennium \r\npublic — will need to be considered in that strategy and \r\ntheir complementarities greatly strengthened. Public \r\nsources will remain critical, and it is imperative that \r\ndeveloped countries fulfil their official development \r\nassistance commitments. Developing countries and \r\nthe least developed countries in particular suffer from \r\nthe recent decline in ODA. At the same time, domestic \r\nresource mobilization needs to be strengthened. \r\nInternational tax cooperation remains crucial. Means \r\nof improving the institutional arrangements for tax \r\ncooperation were discussed at the special meeting of \r\nthe Committee of Experts on International Cooperation \r\nin Tax Matters in May this year.\r\nPublic sources of financing alone will not suffice. \r\nA financing strategy for sustainable development \r\nwill have to put greater emphasis on directing private \r\nf lows towards sustainable development investments. \r\nPublic funds can be used to leverage private resources. \r\nExamples of creative strategies being used to do that \r\nwere presented at the Economic and Social Council \r\npanel discussion. A more stable financial system and \r\nan enabling policy environment will be prerequisites \r\nto facilitate such investments, particularly in the areas \r\nthat are currently underfunded by the private sector. \r\nThose include long-term investments in infrastructure, \r\nriskier investments such as small and medium-size \r\nenterprises, low-carbon technologies and innovations \r\nand financing for the global commons.\r\nWe also discussed the contours and purposes of a \r\nrenewed and strengthened global partnership for the post-\r\n2015 era at the annual high-level meeting in April and at a \r\nhigh-level symposium of the Development Cooperation \r\nForum in Ethiopia in June this year. In its most recent \r\nresolution on strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil (resolution 68/1), the General Assembly called \r\non the Council to continue to strengthen and further \r\npromote dialogue on implementation of the financing \r\nfor the development agenda by strengthening existing \r\narrangements, including its special high-level meeting \r\nwith the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF) and the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment, to be held immediately following the \r\nannual spring meetings of the joint IMF-World Bank \r\nGroup Development Committee. The Council should \r\nalso continue to allocate specific time for deliberation \r\nand consideration of the follow-up to the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development.\r\nThe financing for development process touches on \r\nmany of the key elements of a sustainable development \r\n6/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nthem to developing country projects. Secondly, pension \r\nfund holdings in the countries of the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development alone have \r\nreached $20 trillion. While there are strict rules on how \r\nthese can be used, just as with sovereign wealth funds, \r\nthey are potentially a major source for development \r\nfinancing.\r\nHarnessing and channelling those resources into \r\nsustainable investment projects in the developing world \r\nwill require innovative policy thinking. As an example, \r\nwe at the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment have developed an investment policy \r\nframework for sustainable development, which aims \r\nto mainstream sustainable development in national and \r\ninternational investment regimes.\r\nThe second issue I would like to highlight is \r\nprioritization. We must channel the resources mobilized \r\nstrategically into priority sectors and target countries. \r\nHere, I would reiterate that while global attention is \r\nalready turning to the post-2015 agenda, a great deal \r\nof work remains to be done on meeting the MDGs. \r\nTargeted investments to support key sectors and \r\nprojects, in particular in least developed countries, can \r\nachieve the final push. In prioritizing the allocation of \r\ndevelopment resources, we must also bear in mind that \r\nsocial achievements, such as improved health care and \r\neducation, will ultimately be sustainable only if they \r\nare underpinned by solid economic growth. Indeed, \r\ninclusive economic growth was the most significant \r\nfactor in the progress achieved with respect to many \r\nMDGs. Aid and investment targeted at economic sectors \r\nand building productive capacities should therefore be \r\nscaled up.\r\nThe third issue is effective monitoring. The \r\nMonterrey Conference was convened against the \r\nbackdrop of the MDGs, and yet the commitments made \r\non MDG 8, the partnership on development, are less \r\nambitious than those in the Monterrey document. Even \r\nagainst that more limited standard, progress has been \r\nlacking. As the international community begins to \r\nthink about the post-2015 development agenda, we need \r\nto embrace the financing for development process as a \r\nroad map for addressing the systemic and interrelated \r\neconomic and financial issues, which will determine \r\njust how successful we are in making development a \r\ntruly sustainable and inclusive process. Ideally, the \r\nSDGs should include a goal similar to MDG 8, but \r\nbased on the wider financing for development process.\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), we must consider the costs \r\nof the broader post-2015 development agenda, including \r\nthe need to mitigate and adapt to climate change, \r\nwhich will require an unprecedented transformation \r\nof production and consumption patterns in the world \r\neconomy. Achieving the sustainable development \r\ngoals (SDGs), whatever their final form, will require \r\ninvestment well above current levels in agriculture, \r\ninfrastructure and other areas of sustainable investment. \r\nFor example, in agriculture, the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations estimates that new \r\ninvestments in the amount of $83 billion are needed \r\nannually to meet projected demand for agricultural \r\nproducts in 2050 in 93 developing countries. Of that \r\namount, sub-Saharan Africa alone requires over \r\n$10 billion per year.\r\nWhen it comes to infrastructure, the McKinsey \r\nGlobal Institute estimates that some $57 trillion in \r\ntotal global infrastructure investment is required \r\nbetween now and 2030, much of it in the developing \r\nworld. Africa’s annual infrastructure needs are at least \r\n$93 billion.\r\nWith regard to addressing climate change, the \r\nUnited Nations Department of Economic and Social \r\nAffairs has estimated a staggering $1.9 trillion per year \r\nin additional financing needs.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, allow me to say a few words \r\non how I see the way forward. The first priority must, \r\nof course, be implementation and scaling up. Given the \r\nexpansion in financing needs, we can no longer afford \r\ncomplacency. We must implement the commitments \r\nmade. But we should also look beyond Monterrey \r\ntowards the post-2015 development agenda. We need to \r\nformulate a global strategic framework for investing in \r\nthe sustainable development goals. Such a framework \r\nshould include three core elements: mobilizing the \r\nresources, channelling them into the priority sectors \r\nand maximizing their development impact on the \r\nground.\r\nWith regard to the mobilization of financing, it is \r\nclear that public sources must increase significantly, \r\neven as private sources need to be much more \r\nvigorously tapped and harnessed. Here, the news is \r\nnot all bad. There is a large pool of potential capital \r\navailable to be tapped. Allow me to mention just two \r\nsuch examples. Firstly, the assets held by sovereign \r\nwealth funds today approach $5.8 trillion and, while \r\nmost of these are portfolio investments in advanced \r\neconomies, efforts are being made to channel a share of \r\n13-50226 7/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\ndevelopment financing achievements and challenges. It \r\nis also a time to recall international realities and identify \r\nthe sources of, and approaches to, financing that will \r\ntruly drive development. Work is under way to develop \r\nthe post-2015 development framework. Discussions on \r\nhow we will implement and finance it are beginning. \r\nBut the world has changed since we committed to the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in 2000 and later to \r\ntheir financing.\r\nRapid and sustained economic growth in Asia \r\nhas changed economic and financial capacities in the \r\nregion, with global implications. Developing countries \r\nhave led the recovery in world trade since the global \r\nfinancial crisis. They are driving growth in the global \r\neconomy, a trend that is expected to continue. Those \r\nchanges have driven shifts in the relative size and \r\nimportance of different types of finance available to \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nDomestic government spending in developing \r\ncountries grew from $2.2 trillion in 2000 to \r\n$5.9 trillion in 2011. Foreign direct investment in \r\ndeveloping countries grew from $150 billion in 2000 to \r\n$650 billion in 2011, representing a fourfold increase. \r\nIn comparison, official development assistance (ODA) \r\nincreased from $80 billion in 2000 to $130 billion 10 \r\nyears later. However, ODA is still an important source \r\nof finance for development, particularly in small \r\neconomies. It continues to play a significant role in \r\nsupporting economic reforms and good governance, \r\npromoting the rule of law and building the productive \r\ncapacity of trade-related sectors. While ODA still \r\nrepresents the largest international f low of finance in \r\n43 countries, in 1990 it was the largest source of finance \r\nin 95 countries. Therefore, its importance in many \r\ncountries has decreased. In many developing countries, \r\nparticularly in Asia and the rapidly growing economies \r\nof Africa, other sources of finance are proving more \r\neffective at generating economic growth.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus of the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development and the Doha \r\nDeclaration on Financing for Development provide a \r\ngood basis for discussions on financing the post-2015 \r\nframework. The Monterrey Consensus highlighted \r\nmultiple sources of finance for development at the \r\ndomestic and international levels, including public \r\nand private sources, the role of trade as an engine \r\nfor development and the importance of sustainable \r\ndebt management. The Monterrey Consensus also \r\nunderlined the importance of an enabling international \r\nThe fourth and final issue I would like to f lag \r\ntoday is systemic reform. Of all the chapters in \r\nthe Monterrey and Doha outcome documents, the \r\none addressing systemic issues has seen the least \r\nprogress in implementation. It is inconceivable that \r\neven after the largest financial crisis in 70 years, \r\nfinancial governance reforms at the global level have \r\nremained timid and ad hoc. Addressing the roots of \r\nthe current crisis will require far deeper reforms of \r\nthe global financial system. These include measures \r\nto better regulate speculative financial f lows, improve \r\nexchange-rate management and prevent the build-up \r\nof global imbalances. Most important, reform must \r\nensure that global finance serves the real economy and \r\nsupports productive activities.\r\nYet, any reform of the financial system can only \r\nbe legitimate if developing countries are adequately \r\nrepresented in global financial institutions and if their \r\nvoices are heard. The United Nations, as the only \r\ninstitution with universal membership, can make an \r\nimportant contribution to the deliberations on global \r\ngovernance reform.\r\nAs we meet here today, deliberations on the post-\r\n2015 agenda are intensifying across the globe. But a \r\nnew set of development goals would be meaningless \r\nwithout complementary progress on financing. The \r\nimplementation and scaling up of financing for \r\ndevelopment should therefore be an integral part of this \r\ndebate as it is a key catalyst for development progress \r\nbeyond 2015.\r\nThe President: I should now like to turn to some \r\norganizational matters pertaining to the conduct of \r\nour meeting. With respect to the length of statements, \r\nspeakers are encouraged to limit their statements to five \r\nminutes for national statements and seven minutes for \r\nstatements on behalf of groups, on the understanding \r\nthat that will not preclude the distribution of more \r\nextensive texts. I would like to appeal to speakers to \r\ncooperate in that respect.\r\nTo assist speakers in managing their time a light \r\nsystem has been installed at the speakers’ rostrum that \r\nfunctions as follows. A green light will be activated at \r\nthe start of the speaker’s statement, an orange light will \r\nbe activated 30 seconds before the end of the five or \r\nseven minutes and a red light will be activated when \r\nthe five- or seven-minute time limit has been reached.\r\nMr. Back (Australia): Australia welcomes the \r\nopportunity provided by this dialogue to take stock of \r\n8/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nparticularly the private sector. Australia is committed \r\nto playing its part in that effort. Concrete steps need \r\nto be taken to assist developing countries build, access \r\nand effectively use multiple sources of finance to drive \r\nsustainable economic growth.\r\nMr. Thomson (Fiji): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the 133 member States of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.\r\nI would like to thank the President for convening \r\nthis High-level Dialogue on the important theme \r\nfocusing on the status of implementation and tasks \r\nahead in relation to the Monterrey Consensus and the \r\nDoha Declaration on Financing for Development. I \r\nwould also like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the follow-up to and implementation of the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration (A/68/357).\r\nThe Group of 77 and China shares a number of \r\nconcerns identified in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/68/357), particularly in the areas of international \r\nfinancial and technical cooperation for development, \r\ninternational trade, external debt and the need to \r\naddress systemic issues to enhance the coherence and \r\nconsistency of the international monetary, financial \r\nand trading systems in supporting development.\r\nConsistent with the theme of the High-level \r\nDialogue, the Group wishes to recall paragraph 90 of \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development \r\nand the decision contained in resolution 67/199 to \r\nhold informal consultations with a view to taking a \r\nfinal decision on the need for a follow-up conference \r\non financing for development by 2013. With less than \r\nthree months to go before the end of 2013, we would \r\nlike to urge the President, in his capacity as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, to \r\nappoint co-facilitators before the end of the year and \r\nto hold open, inclusive and direct intergovernmental \r\nconsultations, with the participation of all Member \r\nStates, on all issues related to the conference.\r\nIn view of the development summit at the level \r\nof heads of State and Government, mandated to be \r\nheld in September 2015, for the adoption of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, the Group believes that a \r\nfollow-up international conference on financing for \r\ndevelopment should be held before the end of 2015, in \r\norder for the conference to contribute meaningfully to \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda process.\r\nOn the modalities of financing for development \r\nand arrangements to strengthen the follow-up process, \r\nfinancial, monetary and trading system conducive to \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is clear that trade continues to be an important \r\ndriver of development. The economic growth of \r\ndeveloping countries can be unlocked through trade. \r\nThat is why Australia will continue to promote trade \r\nliberalization at the global level through the World \r\nTrade Organization and at the regional and bilateral \r\nlevels. That will be a key theme for us when we chair \r\nthe Group of 20 in 2014.\r\nOther sources of finance are also growing in \r\nimportance. Private development assistance from \r\nindividuals through non-governmental organizations, \r\nfoundations and corporate giving is growing much \r\nfaster than ODA, although from a small base. \r\nMoreover, development cooperation from developing \r\ncountries — South-South cooperation — will be an \r\nintegral part of financing the post-2015 framework.\r\nSince the Monterrey Consensus, there has also \r\nbeen an increasing focus on the importance of a \r\nvibrant private sector in developing countries to drive \r\nlong-term economic growth. The private sector will \r\nprovide capital for investment and innovative solutions \r\nto development challenges. Building domestic and \r\ninternational enabling environments for a robust \r\nprivate sector will therefore be a crucial component of \r\nfinancing for development.\r\nThe focus of the Monterrey Consensus was on \r\nmobilizing finance for development. Mobilization is \r\nimportant, but will not be enough. This time around \r\nwe will need to expand the focus of our discussions to \r\nlook at how poor countries are able to access and attract \r\ninternational f lows of finance. The experience of the \r\npast 10 years has shown that many small countries, \r\nleast developed countries and fragile States have \r\nlargely missed out on the growth enjoyed by developing \r\ncountries that have had access to international trade and \r\ninvestment opportunities. Helping the former countries \r\naccess similar opportunities is vital. Spending funds \r\neffectively in order to maximize their contribution to \r\neconomic growth will be another integral part of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nWe are looking forward to discussions on financing \r\nfor development that are grounded in current global \r\neconomic realities. We need to learn from public- and \r\nprivate-sector experience and use such experience to \r\ninform future financing decisions. We need to develop \r\nstrong partnerships with a range of development actors, \r\n13-50226 9/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\ngross national product (GNP) as ODA to developing \r\ncountries, including the target of 0.15-0.20 per cent of \r\nGNP to the LDCs.\r\nMoreover, given the urgency and seriousness of \r\nclimate change, the operationalization and capitalization \r\nof the Green Climate Fund by early 2014 must be \r\nprioritized and scaled up to reach $100 billion per year \r\nby 2020. In the context of sustainable development, \r\nthe Fund will play a key role in channelling new, \r\nadditional, adequate and predictable financial resources \r\nto developing countries and will catalyse climate \r\nchange-related finance, both public and private, and at \r\nboth the international and the national levels.\r\nThe G-77 recognizes that innovative mechanisms of \r\nfinancing can make a positive contribution in assisting \r\ndeveloping countries to mobilize additional resources \r\nfor development on a stable, predictable and voluntary \r\nbasis\r\nWe reiterate that such financing should neither \r\nsubstitute for nor negatively affect the level of traditional \r\nsources of development financing, including ODA. \r\nWe believe that there has been considerable progress \r\nin innovative sources of financing for development, \r\nalthough it is important to scale up present initiatives \r\nand develop new mechanisms, as appropriate. Priorities \r\nshould remain focused, in particular, on providing \r\nadditional, stable and supplementary resources to \r\ntraditional development financing, particularly in \r\nfavour of developing countries.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration also stress the importance of remittances \r\nfor development. The Group supports the call of the \r\nSecretary-General, contained in his report (A/68/357), \r\nfor source and destination countries to collaborate with \r\na view to reducing the transaction costs of remittances, \r\nand where possible, relax legal and funding barriers to \r\nremittances and other financial f lows by migrants.\r\nDebt crisis is costly and disruptive and often \r\nfollowed by cuts in public spending, adversely affecting \r\ndeveloping countries. There is no path to growth and no \r\nsuccess in poverty eradication with unsustainable debt \r\noverhang. Debt relief and sovereign debt management \r\nare, therefore, crucial issues for developing countries. \r\nIn that regard, the Group reiterates its call for the \r\ninternational community to urgently examine options \r\nfor an effective, equitable, durable, independent \r\nand development-friendly debt-restructuring and \r\ninternational debt-resolution mechanism.\r\nthe Group reiterates its call for the establishment of an \r\nappropriate follow-up mechanism within the United \r\nNations system, a commission or subsidiary body of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council on financing for \r\ndevelopment to bridge the gap between policy-making \r\nand the implementation of commitments, as well as to \r\nensure the necessary support for the implementation of \r\nthe internationally agreed development goals.\r\nThe Group welcomes the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to convene at the current session a separate \r\nmeeting of the Second Committee under the item \r\n“Macroeconomic policy questions” to discuss actions in \r\nresponse to the world financial and economic crisis and \r\nits impact on development, as a further contribution to \r\nthe follow-up to the Conference on the World Financial \r\nand Economic Crisis and its Impact on Development.\r\nGiven the importance of that agenda item for \r\ndeveloping countries, the Group will submit four \r\ndraft resolutions relating to international trade and \r\ndevelopment, the international financial system \r\nand development, external debt sustainability and \r\ndevelopment, and commodities to the upcoming Second \r\nCommittee session.\r\nThe Group of 77 reiterates its view that the global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis cannot be used as a \r\nconvenient justification for developed partners to avoid \r\nfulfilling existing international financial and technical \r\ncooperation for development. It is ironic that official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) continues to decline as \r\nour leaders reaffirmed recently, at the special event \r\non MDGs, their commitment to accelerate progress \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs by the 2015 deadline and \r\nanticipate elaborating a bold post-2015 development \r\nagenda, with poverty eradication and sustainability as \r\nits core.\r\nWhile ODA alone is insufficient to meet the \r\nfull sustainable-development needs of developing \r\ncountries, it remains crucial for countries without \r\nsufficient resources to fulfil the development goals. \r\nAn enhanced, predictable and sustainable f low of ODA \r\nis essential in order to meet the regular development \r\nchallenges, as well as new and emerging challenges in \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular in least-developed \r\ncountries (LDCs). In that respect, the Group expresses \r\nits deep concern that, for the second time, ODA fell \r\nfor two consecutive years and that developed countries, \r\nwith a few exceptions, are still far from achieving the \r\nlong-outstanding goal of mobilizing 0.7 per cent of \r\n10/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\noutcome once again made it abundantly clear that \r\nstrengthening international development cooperation is \r\nkey to achieving the MDGs. As we stand at the dawn \r\nof a new era and embark upon the task of formulating \r\na new global development framework, international \r\ndevelopment cooperation should remain at the heart of \r\nthe process.\r\nIn few days’ time, finance ministers, central \r\nbankers, private-sector executives and academics from \r\naround the world will gather in Washington, D.C., for \r\nthe annual meeting of the World Bank Group and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. We believe that it will \r\nbe an opportunity of which policy-makers should \r\nmake effective use to deliberate and agree on concrete \r\nmeasures that need to be taken, not only to speed up \r\nthe recovery of the global economy but also to lay the \r\nbasis for greater readiness to participate in effectively \r\nfinancing development. For low-income countries to \r\nmitigate the effects of global economic slowdown, it is \r\ncritical that they continue to rebuild their fiscal buffers \r\nso as to maintain growth and preserve spending in \r\nsocial sectors and public investment. We hope that this \r\nwill be one of the key policy recommendations that will \r\ncome out of that meeting.\r\nIt is true that some steps have been taken over the \r\npast decade in implementing the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nbut much more still remains to be done. According \r\nto the Secretary-General’s report (A/68/357), official \r\ndevelopment assistance fell in real terms for a second \r\nconsecutive year in 2012, with many Development \r\nAssistance Committee (DAC) member countries still \r\nunable to achieve the 0.7 per cent target. Aid to least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) also fell, with only 10 \r\nDAC members reaching the target. What the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment said to this meeting is indeed very valid. \r\nIt is therefore critical for development partners to meet \r\nthe commitments they made in Monterrey and Doha if \r\nwe are to embark on a promising journey in 2015.\r\nWe also need much more determined efforts that go \r\nbeyond the current circumstances to address new and \r\nemerging challenges, such as climate change. We need \r\nto join efforts to establish a binding climate regime \r\nwith specific targets by 2015. And our development \r\npartners in the developed world must be committed \r\nto raising $100 billion per year by 2020 for the Green \r\nClimate Fund in order to help developing countries \r\nadapt meaningfully to climate change and mitigate its \r\neffects.\r\nThe Group views international trade as an engine \r\nfor development. In that regard, a fair multilateral \r\ntrading system is essential in order to ensure sustained \r\ngrowth in global trade and create new market access \r\nand opportunities for developing countries. We believe \r\nthat the ninth Ministerial Conference of the World \r\nTrade Organization (WTO), scheduled to take place \r\nin Bali in December 2013, will provide an opportunity \r\nto advance the Doha Round of trade negotiations and \r\nbreak the long-standing impasse. The Bali Conference \r\nshould fully respect the WTO’s development mandate \r\nand take into account the needs and priorities of \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nLastly, the Group of 77 wishes to underscore \r\nthe importance of having a favourable and enabling \r\ninternational environment to complement developing \r\ncountries’ national efforts in eradicating poverty \r\nand advancing their level of development. Systemic \r\nshortcomings of the international monetary, financial \r\nand economic institutions must be addressed through \r\nserious reforms. A more inclusive framework of \r\nglobal economic governance is required to improve \r\nthe functioning, stability and resilience of those \r\ninstitutions. It requires a strengthened role and \r\nincreased effectiveness of the United Nations, including \r\nhigh-level engagements with all relevant international \r\nand regional financial institutions and other relevant \r\nstakeholders.\r\nMr. Alemu (Ethiopia): On behalf of the African \r\nGroup, I would like to express our appreciation to you, \r\nSir, for organizing this timely and important High-\r\nlevel Dialogue. We thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/68/221). Indeed, we share the views expressed \r\nby the Chair of the Group of 77 and China, of which we \r\nform a vital part.\r\nWe are convening this Dialogue at a time of great \r\nuncertainty and, at the same time, of enormous hope. \r\nThe uncertainty pertains to the situation with respect to \r\nthe global economy, which has yet to recover fully from \r\nthe crisis that began five years ago. Alhough there has \r\nundoubtedly there been improvement, the recovery has \r\nbeen sluggish. Hope, on the other hand, can be seen in \r\nthe unprecedented positive conditions that characterize \r\nmany economies in the developing world, including \r\nthose in Africa.\r\nWe all recall that the high-level events on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) held two \r\nweeks ago concluded that more needed to be done if \r\nwe were to achieve the Goals by the deadline. That \r\n13-50226 11/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nFurthermore, in our efforts to ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we need the support of our partners in \r\naddressing infrastructure deficits, which still remain \r\nthe greatest challenges in our continent. In that regard, \r\nit is our firm belief that the international community \r\nwill stand by our side to support our regional initiatives \r\nunder the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, \r\nin particular the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa.\r\nNow that we have embarked on the process of \r\nformulating the post-2015 development agenda, we are \r\nafforded once again with an opportunity to make up \r\nfor lost time. The commitments made in Monterrey \r\nand Doha must be pursued with renewed vigour and \r\nurgently acted upon.\r\nIn crafting the next generation of development \r\ngoals, we are confident that a stronger means of \r\nframework implementation will be put in place to \r\naddress the pressing needs of developing countries, in \r\nparticular the LDCs, in a comprehensive and coherent \r\nmanner.\r\nMr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the member States of \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM), namely, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, \r\nDominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nCARICOM wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatement delivered earlier by the representative of Fiji \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nPermit me to use this occasion to acknowledge \r\nthe work you have done thus far, Sir, in your role as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. CARICOM welcomes the convening of the sixth \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\nIndeed, the theme of this year’s Dialogue — “The \r\nMonterrey Consensus, Doha Declaration on Financing \r\nfor Development and related outcomes of major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits: status of \r\nimplementation and tasks ahead” — comes at a time \r\nwhen we are moving towards a post-2015 agenda. It \r\ntherefore affords us an opportune moment to assess \r\nthe status of development cooperation, exchange views \r\nand renew efforts towards commitments set out by the \r\ninternational community at Monterrey and Doha.\r\nThe global financial and economic crisis, along \r\nwith the food crisis and volatile food prices, continues \r\nLast year at the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (Rio+20), we took a historic \r\ndecision by which we agreed that extreme poverty was \r\nthe overarching challenge faced by the international \r\ncommunity, and to address that in the context of \r\nsustainable development, taking into account the \r\ninterests of present and future generations by focusing \r\non the three pillars of sustainable development. With \r\nrespect to the core challenge we face, poverty, it \r\nmust be stressed that its eradication in a sustainable \r\nmanner cannot be conceived of outside the context \r\nof adding value — the expansion of manufacturing \r\nand industrialization. In other words, countries such \r\nas those in Africa must be assisted in their efforts to \r\nbring about structural transformation, without which \r\neffective strides toward eradicating poverty cannot \r\nbe taken. In our view, that is the same conviction that \r\nshould guide the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe in Africa have made significant strides in \r\nachieving our development objectives. Some of the \r\nfastest-growing economies in the world are now found \r\nin Africa. The f low of foreign direct investment is also \r\nincreasing, with emerging economies playing a key \r\nrole, in particular in critical sectors contributing to the \r\ndevelopment process on the continent.\r\nDespite such achievements, the economic structure \r\nof many countries on the continent has yet to develop \r\nadequately to address the various social and economic \r\nchallenges and to achieve the economic transformation \r\nthat is so critical, in particular for eradicating poverty \r\nin a sustainable manner.\r\nIn that regard, we believe that the major part of \r\ndevelopment financing should be geared towards \r\nenhancing the capacity of developing countries to \r\nmobilize domestic resources. We are well aware \r\nthat economic development is a domestically driven \r\nenterprise, and no amount of foreign assistance \r\nor investment can substitute a coherent, dynamic \r\nand domestically driven capital accumulation, \r\nintermediation and mobilization process. It is therefore \r\nparamount that if we are to address the gaps in domestic \r\nresource mobilization, development cooperation should \r\naim at addressing institutional constraints so as to \r\ncreate organizations that have the responsibility and \r\ncapacity to initiate, plan, design and implement reforms \r\nto ensure effective revenue collection. No doubt, \r\naddressing the problem of supply constraints should \r\nemerge as a priority in that regard.\r\n12/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\ncountries that are categorized as middle- and high-\r\nincome countries, with the goal of providing them with \r\nincreased access to concessionary financing. Such an \r\napproach, which would incorporate the provision of \r\ndebt relief and the disbursement of grants and loans \r\non concessionary terms, which are not available at \r\nthis time to middle- and high-income countries, would \r\nserve to ease the unsustainable economic situation in \r\nwhich many small, vulnerable States find themselves.\r\nThe financing for development process provides \r\na comprehensive framework for the mobilization of \r\nresources. While we note that economic and social \r\ndevelopment is primarily a national responsibility, the \r\nimportance of international support in development \r\nshould be highlighted. In that regard, we acknowledge \r\nthe efforts that have been made by some development \r\npartners to achieve and, in some instances, exceed, \r\nthe target of allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national \r\nincome to official development assistance (ODA), in \r\nspite of the very challenging international political and \r\neconomic environment in the past two years. However, \r\nwe continue to remain concerned that many others have \r\nfallen short of meeting the target.\r\nCARICOM acknowledges that, in our efforts to \r\nmarshal international resources for development, it is \r\nessential that we assume new and innovative approaches. \r\nIn that vein, we welcome and support the establishment \r\nof the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing. The Committee \r\nhas been tasked with preparing a report, following a \r\nyear of work, that would recommend options on an \r\neffective sustainable development financing strategy \r\nto facilitate the mobilization of resources and their \r\neffective use in achieving sustainable development \r\nobjectives. With four of our members represented on \r\nthe Committee, we are committed to engaging actively \r\nin that process and to working assiduously to comply \r\nwith the mandate of the Committee.\r\nThe role of international trade is indispensable in \r\nadvancing the development prospects of developing \r\ncountries and enhancing our capacity to mobilize \r\ndomestic financial resources for development. \r\nIn order to maximize the potential of trade, it is \r\nnecessary to uphold a universal, rules-based, open, \r\nnon-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading \r\nsystem that contributes to growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that context, CARICOM reiterates its \r\ncall for the conclusion of the Doha Development Round \r\nof negotiations, which commenced over a decade ago. \r\nto have a negative impact on the small, vulnerable \r\neconomies of developing countries. For many, the \r\nachievement of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, with particular reference to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), has been severely \r\nhampered. As we head into the post-2015 development \r\nframework, therefore, it is incumbent upon us all to use \r\nthe next two days to determine ways in which we can \r\naddress the issue of the availability of domestic and \r\ninternational financing for development and the very \r\nreal impact such financing has on the development \r\ncooperation landscape.\r\nAs we continue to grapple with the global and \r\neconomic crisis, the integrated framework adopted \r\nby the Monterrey Consensus and, later, the Doha \r\nDeclaration, provides a useful platform for international \r\ncooperation on economic and financial issues that will \r\nhelp countries to overcome multifaceted development \r\nchallenges that ultimately undermine poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development.\r\nCARICOM can never overstate its concern over \r\nthe insignificant recognition by the international \r\ncommunity of the needs and concerns of small, open, \r\nvulnerable and highly indebted economies like ours, \r\nwhich by virtue of per capita gross domestic product are \r\nclassified as middle- and even high-income countries. \r\nThat is a critical development challenge faced by \r\nour member States, many of which have a debt-to-\r\ngross domestic product ratio of 100 per cent, which \r\nsignificantly reduces available fiscal space and inhibits \r\nour ability to attain some of our development goals.\r\nThat reality is not overlooked by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his report on the international financial \r\nsystem and development, where he emphasizes that the \r\nproblem of sovereign debt distress is “most acute among \r\ncountries in the Caribbean, which were negatively \r\nimpacted by the financial crisis” (A/68/221, para. 70), \r\nresulting in several countries running fiscal deficits \r\nand relying on increased borrowing. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral notes in the report that this year alone, as a \r\nresult of our high dependence on tourism and of the \r\nerosion of trade preferences, Belize, Grenada, Jamaica \r\nand Saint Kitts and Nevis have all sought to restructure \r\nportions of their debt.\r\nIt is imperative that the international community, \r\nincluding the United Nations development system and \r\nthe international financial institutions, not only take \r\nnote of those facts but take a more systematic approach \r\nto deal with the development needs of developing \r\n13-50226 13/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nPacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, the Atlantic and \r\nIndian Oceans and the Mediterranean and South China \r\nSeas.\r\nWe welcome the convening of the sixth High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Financing for Development, in \r\naccordance with resolution 67/300. It provides us \r\nwith an opportunity to review the status of the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus of 2003, \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development of \r\n2008 and the related outcomes of major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits.\r\nWe are at a juncture where the world is facing \r\nchallenges in all three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment —  economic, social and environmental. \r\nDespite progress towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), more than 1 billion \r\npeople still live in extreme poverty. Income inequality \r\nwithin and between countries continues to rise. At the \r\nsame time, unsustainable consumption and production \r\npatterns have resulted in huge economic and social \r\ncosts and have already endangered life on the planet.\r\nAchieving sustainable development demands our \r\ncollective action in order to deliver on aspirations \r\nfor further economic and social progress that involve \r\nsustainable economic growth and employment while \r\nstrengthening environmental protection. It must have \r\nan inclusive agenda and address the specific needs of \r\ncountries in special cases that are vulnerable and have \r\nunique challenges. We, the small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS), recognize that we cannot overcome our \r\nchallenges by ourselves. In the absence of cooperation \r\nand assistance on the part of the international \r\ncommunity, our success in that regard will remain an \r\nillusion.\r\nSIDS remain committed to ensuring the full, \r\neffective and efficient implementation of the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \r\nof Small Island Developing States, the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \r\nof Small Island Developing States and the MDGs. \r\nWe urge our development partners to fulfil their \r\ncommitments by providing, in a timely and predictable \r\nmanner, the financial and technical support needed to \r\nensure the successful implementation of the Programme \r\nand the Strategy, as well as other internationally agreed \r\noutcomes. The cross-cutting connections between the \r\noutcome (resolution 66/288, annex) of the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nThe failure to do so is constricting the fundamental \r\nobjective of the round and the explicit commitments to \r\naddress development issues head on.\r\nCARICOM emphasizes the urgent need for an \r\ninformed discussion of international cooperation in tax \r\nmatters within the context of a meaningful dialogue \r\non financing for development, which is the common \r\npursuit of all countries to achieve economic growth, \r\nmeaningful development and poverty eradication. In that \r\nconnection, CARICOM welcomes the recent decision \r\nof the Economic and Social Council to annualize \r\nthe special meetings of the Council on international \r\ntax cooperation. CARICOM also believes that that \r\ndecision represents an important step in realizing the \r\nmandate given in Doha to strengthen the institutional \r\narrangements to promote international cooperation in \r\ntax matters. In that context, CARICOM continues to \r\ncall for the conversion of the Committee of Experts \r\non International Cooperation in Tax Matters into an \r\nintergovernmental subsidiary body of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. CARICOM strongly believes that \r\nthe upgrading of the Committee in that manner would \r\na1low for a proper intergovernmental consideration of \r\nissues of international tax cooperation.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus, the Doha Declaration \r\non Financing for Development and the related \r\noutcomes of major United Nations conferences have \r\nfound us at this juncture, where the implementation \r\nof commitments remains wanting and the tasks ahead \r\nenormous. However, CARICOM is convinced that the \r\nway forward lies in the political will to ensure that the \r\nchallenges that we are up against do not multiply and \r\nthat our development objectives are met.\r\nAs we work towards the achievement of \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe MDGs, and as we begin to set the stage for the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, one fact remains clear: \r\nglobal partnership is fundamental. Commitments have \r\nto be fulfilled. The Commitments made in respect of \r\noverseas development assistance, as well as South-South \r\nand triangular cooperation, as a complement to, and not \r\na substitute for, traditional ODA, have to be fulfilled. \r\nCommitments to provide financing for climate change \r\nadaptation, particularly for small island developing \r\nStates and other countries that are vulnerable to the \r\nadverse impacts of climate change, have to be fulfilled.\r\nMs. Young (Belize): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island \r\nStates, which includes countries in the areas of the \r\n14/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nThere are a number of possible additional financing \r\nmechanisms that merit serious consideration. They \r\ninclude imposing a tax on financial transactions \r\nthat financial-market instability and other negative \r\nexternalities may be associated with; taxing financial \r\ntransactions, in every jurisdiction, that are a direct \r\ncause of financial-market instability; ceasing \r\nunsustainable subsidies; improving and strengthening \r\nresource allocation and distribution, based on sound \r\ninvestment policy decisions; and encouraging donor \r\npartners, the United Nations system and the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions to utilize country-specific budget-\r\nsupport financial mechanisms to ensure the improved \r\ncoordination, efficiency and effectiveness of official \r\ndevelopment assistance and other capital resources. At \r\nthe same time, we should be mindful of the unintended \r\nnegative effects of some such mechanisms. The impact \r\nof the air-passenger duty on the tourism sectors of some \r\nSIDS is one example.\r\nIn order to accelerate the mobilization and \r\nutilization of funds for defined purposes, partners’ \r\nfulfilment of their current and past commitments is a \r\nmust — and a first — for all such agreed-on obligations, \r\nincluding those undertaken under other international \r\nconventions, before leaping towards the financing \r\nof sustainable development goals and the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. For example, the global official \r\ndevelopment assistance target, of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income, is only at 0.29 per cent to date, and the \r\ntarget level should be met. The operationalization and \r\ncapitalization of the Green Climate Fund by early 2014 \r\nmust be prioritized and scaled up to reach $100 billion \r\nper year by 2020.\r\nWe underscore the importance of the follow-up to \r\nthe outcome of the Rio+20 Conference and of ensuring \r\nthe full implementation of the Barbados Programme \r\nof Action and the Mauritius Strategy. For SIDS to \r\nensure a finance strategy that can effectively finance \r\nour sustainable development, those elements must be \r\nconsidered. First, human development remains a key \r\npriority, as people are our most valuable asset. We must \r\nrealize the full potential of our human resources, and \r\nproductive employment and decent work for all are \r\nessential.\r\nSIDS call for international support for national \r\nand regional initiatives that serve to enhance the \r\nvoice and participation of SIDS at every level of the \r\ndecision-making and norm-setting processes of the \r\ninternational finance systems, thus increasing their \r\n(Rio+20), the United Nations post-2015 development \r\nagenda and the future of financing for sustainable \r\ndevelopment require comprehensive analysis and \r\nreview.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda should be \r\nguided by a transformational strategy that links the \r\nRio+20 outcomes with those of the third International \r\nConference of Small Island Developing States, to be \r\nheld in Samoa in 2014, and with a strategy for financing \r\nsustainable development. In short, we need a strategy \r\nthat links national sustainable development priorities \r\nand the global development agenda. This Dialogue \r\ntherefore provides a key opportunity for discussing the \r\nconnections. It will help guide our review of the status \r\nof implementation and the tasks ahead, and it will help \r\nguide our work to ensure that a transformational shift \r\ntakes place in the implementation of both our agreed \r\nand future commitments for sustainable development.\r\nWe underscore the need to focus on reducing \r\npoverty, improving access to basic social services, \r\nenhancing gender equality and achieving environmental \r\nsustainability. We must move away from unsustainable \r\npolicy frameworks, such as fossil-fuel subsidies, \r\ntowards those that encourage sustainable production \r\nand consumption patterns while protecting the most \r\nvulnerable from the effects of higher food and energy \r\nprices, as well as those who could lose out in the \r\ntransition to green economies that build resilience \r\nin our countries and communities to climate change \r\nand other socioeconomic risks. We need clear and \r\npractical measures for securing progress in sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We must better inform development \r\npolicy decisions at all levels. The implementation of \r\nthose key policies in our economic frameworks will \r\ncontribute to a greater mobilization of resources and \r\nhigher levels of economic growth.\r\nThe costs of shifting towards a sustainable future \r\nare real. Helping to create an environment conducive \r\nto generating and directing capital f lows — such as \r\nofficial development assistance, domestically available \r\npublic finance and other sources — to projects where \r\nthey can deliver the largest transformational impact is \r\na critically important task for the public sector. No less \r\nimportant is ensuring that the public funds available to \r\nsupport national transitions to sustainable development \r\nare used to leverage and catalyse larger pools of private \r\nfinance. We must also be innovative in exploring new \r\nfinancial mechanisms that can move the process along \r\nand enable the achievement of sustainable development.\r\n13-50226 15/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\ncountries (LDCs). The group aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nThe fundamental issue of the means for \r\nachieving the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals — particularly the Millennium Development \r\nGoals — is at the heart of the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development. In \r\nboth those documents, developed countries undertook \r\nfirm commitments to provide at least 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross national product (GNP) to developing countries \r\nin official development assistance, and at least 0.15 to \r\n0.20 per cent of GNP to the least developed countries. \r\nThey also pledged to ensure duty-free and quota-free \r\naccess for products from developing countries; to seek \r\na durable solution to the debt problems of developing \r\ncountries; to provide technological and technical \r\nsupport as necessary; and to reform the international \r\nfinancial architecture. However, little progress has \r\nbeen made in those areas to date.\r\nFor their part, the least developed countries have \r\nmade significant efforts to develop stable, equitable \r\ninstitutional and regulatory frameworks aimed at \r\nthe public and private sectors and civil society, as \r\nrequested under the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration. Considerable progress has been achieved \r\non many fronts, including promoting democracy and \r\nhuman rights and establishing the rule of law. However, \r\nthere has been no resulting decrease in the major gap \r\nbetween savings and investment, which is necessary to \r\npromote sustainable growth.\r\nRevenues that scarcely ensure livelihoods, a weak \r\ntax base, high rates of tax evasion and a predominant \r\ninformal sector constitute the factors causing the \r\nlow ratio of tax collection to GNP among LDCs. \r\nSubstantial national and international efforts are \r\nnecessary to promote the creation and establishment of \r\nan environment conducive to economic growth.\r\nIn spite of improvements to the business \r\nenvironment, LDCs have been marginalized in terms \r\nof the global production network. Foreign direct \r\ninvestment in LDCs rose 20 per cent in 2012; however, \r\nthat group — which comprises 12 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population — received less than 2 per cent of \r\ntotal global investment. The lion’s share of investment \r\nin the LDCs is in natural-resource extraction and the \r\nrelated manufacturing industries. The international \r\ncommunity must take appropriate measures to promote \r\ninvestment in LDCs and ensure equitable distribution \r\ncapacity and development. We furthermore call for \r\nthe simplification and development of international \r\naccess to allow SIDS direct access to financing for \r\nsustainable development. We call for the establishment \r\nof a dedicated mechanism to provide financing to \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular SIDS, and attention \r\nto the special challenges in financing sustainable \r\ndevelopment in SIDS, including access to concessionary \r\nfinancing to be considered by the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Financing for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and other related bodies.\r\nAccess to sustainable energy is an area that can help \r\nraise efficiency and productivity and reduce emissions, \r\nwhile at the same time creating incentives for clean \r\ntechnologies.\r\nOur Dialogue today is an indispensable process that \r\ncomplements, and hopefully integrates, a very specific \r\noutreach strategy related to the work modalities of the \r\nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts. The results \r\nof our deliberations must be taken into account in the \r\npost-2015 development agenda process.\r\nFor SIDS, it is crystal-clear that we live in an \r\ninterdependent world, in which all people are bound \r\nto one another by a shared humanity that cherishes \r\nlife, works for equality and strives for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAn important test of our resolve will be measured \r\nby how successfully we strengthen cooperation for \r\ncollective action. We look forward to reinvigorating \r\nthe international community’s commitment to a global \r\npartnership that will enable SIDS to eradicate extreme \r\npoverty, build resilience and improve the quality of \r\nlife for our peoples. We will need active engagement \r\nand cooperation from the United Nations system, \r\nour partners and other key stakeholders. That global \r\npartnership should be transparent, inclusive and build \r\nupon existing mutual respect and accountability to \r\nensure that the financing for sustainable development \r\nis effective.\r\nMr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): I want to \r\nthank you, Sir, for convening this High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development. I assure you of my \r\ndelegation’s cooperation. We are keenly interested in \r\nthe success of this meeting and will spare no effort to \r\nthat end.\r\nIt is my honour to speak on behalf of the group of \r\n49 States on the United Nations list of least developed \r\n16/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nWe commend the member countries of the \r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development for already \r\nhaving achieved the recommended level of official \r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nWe urge those countries that have not yet done so \r\nto fulfil their commitments, especially in regard to \r\nproviding 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of the gross \r\nnational product to least developed countries as soon \r\nas possible and to increase their aid to LDCs when they \r\nredefine their commitments to finance the development \r\nassistance programme in 2015, taking into account \r\nthat LDCs are the ones most affected by the current \r\nfinancial and economic crisis.\r\nSources of innovative financing can also play a \r\nmajor role in finding ways to fill the financing gaps of \r\nLDCs. We note that a number of initiatives have already \r\nbeen made operational or are at an advanced stage of \r\nimplementation. The World Economic and Social Survey \r\n2012: In Search of New Development Finance indicates \r\nthat $400 billion to $450 billion can be mobilized every \r\nyear through taxes on financial transactions and carbon \r\nemissions and the use of special drawing rights at the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. Those initiatives should \r\nbe made operational.\r\nExternal debt represents a serious challenge for \r\nLDCs. We welcome the measures taken under the \r\nMultilateral Debt Relief Initiative. However, those \r\nmeasures are not sufficient and must be extended \r\nto all LDCs. All countries that meet the criteria to \r\nbe categorized as LDCs should be made eligible for \r\ndebt relief programmes. All the debts of the LDCs, \r\nwhether multilateral or bilateral, should be cancelled \r\nforthwith. Development assistance given to LDCs \r\nshould preferably be in the form of non-reimbursable \r\ndonations to avoid a recurrence of the debt crisis. We \r\nwould like to request that mechanisms be established to \r\nfreeze and deleverage the debt of LDCs.\r\nSouth-South cooperation has emerged as a vital \r\nforce on the economic landscape and is broadening \r\nin scope significantly. The potential of South-South \r\ncooperation in investment, trade and development \r\nassistance must be mobilized as a true complement \r\nto North-South cooperation without being considered \r\na substitute for it. In that context, attracting the \r\ninvestment of the sovereign wealth funds of developing \r\ncountries in sectors such as agriculture and agro-\r\nindustry could be a viable solution.in helping LDCs \r\ndevelop their productive capacity.\r\nin order to effectively support economic growth, job \r\ncreation, technology acquisition and free trade in those \r\ncountries.\r\nThe least developed countries have also worked \r\nhard to attract foreign direct investment. To support \r\nthose efforts, developed countries should now establish \r\nan investment promotion system for LDCs, including \r\nmeasures regarding insurance, guarantees, preferential \r\nfinancing programmes and funding to support \r\nprivate-sector initiatives aimed at investment in LDCs, \r\nas agreed under the Istanbul Programme of Action.\r\nIn that context, we look forward to the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General to be introduced at the sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly. In that respect, \r\nwe hope to benefit from the firm support of the \r\ninternational community to establish a framework to \r\nsupport investment in LDCs.\r\nThe stalemate in the trade negotiations of the Doha \r\nRound represent a major setback in the international \r\ntrading system. We must mobilize the necessary \r\npolitical will to complete that round of negotiations and \r\nensure the full realization of its development agenda. \r\nWe call on the States members of the World Trade \r\nOrganization to make every effort to conclude the trade \r\nnegotiations and ensure an outcome that is ambitious, \r\ncomprehensive, balanced, fair and aimed at promoting \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe urge all stakeholders to seek consensus on a \r\npackage of measures to support LDCs at the next \r\nministerial meeting in Bali, to be held from 3 to \r\n6 December, including free market access and simple \r\nand f lexible preferential rules, as well as ensuring the \r\nimplementation of exemptions with regard to services \r\nand cotton.\r\nWe also call on developed countries to meet \r\nthe needs of LDCs in the areas of trade capacity \r\ndevelopment through aid-for-trade, as agreed in the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action.\r\nWe recognize that official development assistance \r\nremains the main source of funding for the development \r\nfor LDCs, and serves as a shield against the volatility \r\nand instability of the global economic environment. We \r\nhereby express our concern about the decline in official \r\ndevelopment assistance provided to LDCs, which \r\ndropped from 11 per cent in 2010 to 10 per cent in 2011. \r\nWe are highly concerned about preliminary estimates \r\nindicating a decrease of 12.8 per cent in ODA in 2012, \r\nas compared to 2011.\r\n13-50226 17/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\non financing for development, released in July, revealed \r\nthat good progress had been made towards meeting most \r\nof the European Union’s ambitious commitments. For \r\nexample, over the past 10 years, the European Union and \r\nits member States committed almost €45 billion per year \r\nto development aid — more than half of the assistance \r\nreported by the Development Assistance Committee \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment. The European Union remains the largest \r\ntrading partner of developing countries and the market \r\nmost open to them, and the European Union accounted \r\nfor 71 per cent of global debt relief over the period from \r\n2000 to 2011.\r\nWe believe that the Monterrey Consensus and Doha \r\nDeclaration provide a strong conceptual underpinning \r\nupon which to base our future discussions on financing \r\nfor development. The key intellectual breakthroughs \r\nthey embody, a comprehensive approach with shared \r\nresponsibilities, remain relevant today.\r\nHowever, the world has changed considerably \r\nover the past 10 years — the distribution of global \r\nwealth, countries’ ability to influence global trends, \r\nthe role of emerging donors — so that the conceptual \r\nframework needs to be adapted to new circumstances. \r\nWe have also seen the proliferation of international \r\nfinancing processes and experiences bringing new \r\nways of funding, such as those associated with climate \r\nor biodiversity finance and other innovative modalities.\r\nAt the September Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) special event, the international community \r\nreiterated its commitment to undertake all efforts \r\ntowards achieving the MDGs. The focus should be on \r\nthe most off-track MDGs with particular attention to \r\ncertain groups of countries, such as least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs), landlocked economies and small \r\nisland developing States. The European Union and \r\nits member States remain committed to delivering on \r\nour commitments, and we are focused on helping to \r\nachieve the MDGs. The September MDG special event \r\nalso reaffirmed the importance of mobilizing and using \r\neffectively all resources, public and private, domestic \r\nand international, and called for a coherent approach \r\ntowards a single post-2015 framework and set of goals, \r\nculminating in a summit in September 2015 for the \r\nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nLooking beyond 2015, it will be important to \r\npreserve the Monterrey Consensus and to adapt it to \r\nnew challenges and circumstances. The framework \r\nshould be policy-focused because good policy matters \r\nMs. Miculescu (Romania), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nMy country would like to hold a ministerial-level \r\nconference in April 2014 on new partnerships for \r\ndevelopment of LDCs and to address financing in that \r\ncapacity.\r\nThe economic and financial crisis and its aftermath \r\nhave revealed distortions in the global financial \r\narchitecture. Some measures have been undertaken to \r\nstrengthen the system. The governance scheme for the \r\nBretton Woods institutions must be changed. To correct \r\ntheir democratic deficit, a fundamental reform of their \r\nvoting system and accountability structure should be \r\nundertaken. Special weight must be given to LDCs when \r\nnew quotas are defined so that they can have a greater \r\nvoice in the Bretton Woods institutions. LDCs include \r\nthe vast majority of the poorest countries on Earth, and \r\ntheir voices must be heard and their concerns taken into \r\naccount in all decision-making processes dealing with \r\nfinancial matters at the international level.\r\nThe establishment of a new international financial \r\narchitecture should involve the Governments of LDCs. \r\nThe LDCs constitute the group of the most vulnerable \r\ncountries. Many among them will not be able to achieve \r\nthe MDGs without the necessary financial resources in \r\nplace. Financing for development is therefore crucial \r\nfor them. A review of the implementation of the \r\ncommitments made in the Monterrey Consensus and in \r\nthe Doha Declaration are thus of paramount importance \r\nto them. We must spare no effort in establishing a global \r\naccountability system with universal participation to \r\nensure that the commitments of all stakeholders are \r\nfulfilled.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Mayr-Hartig (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver a statement on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU) and its member States. The candidate \r\ncountries the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nMontenegro, Iceland, Turkey and Serbia; the countries \r\nof the Stabilization and Association Process and \r\npotential candidates Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nas well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, Armenia \r\nand Georgia, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union and its member States have \r\nbeen monitoring all their Monterrey Consensus \r\ncommitments and more on an annual basis since 2003. \r\nThe most recent European Union accountability report \r\n18/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\npriorities of the developing countries be supported \r\nby the international community through enhanced \r\nfinancial and technological assistance and through a \r\nsupportive and fair international economic system.\r\nWhile we have made significant advances in \r\nreducing poverty and achieving human development \r\nover the past decade, the progress in the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals has been uneven, \r\nand many of the Goals will not be achieved by 2015. \r\nA key reason for our collective failure to achieve the \r\nMDGs has been the shortfall in development financing. \r\nThe global partnership to provide the support to achieve \r\nthe MDGs has failed to deliver.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/68/357) on \r\nthe follow-up to and implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and Doha Declaration presents a sobering \r\npicture. The multiple global crises of the past several \r\nyears have had a deleterious impact on the ability of the \r\ndeveloping countries to mobilize financial resources \r\nfor their development aspirations. Their capacities \r\nhave been further eroded by the widening gap in aid \r\ndelivery and the reversal of capital f lows. The gap \r\nbetween commitments and disbursement of official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) reached $167 billion \r\nin 2011 and further widened in 2012. Aid to the least \r\ndeveloped countries, who most need assistance, has \r\nalso dipped in real terms.\r\nIt is a matter of serious concern that, just as the \r\nworld commits to accelerating progress towards the \r\nMDGs by 2015 and elaborating an ambitious post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, the prospects for ODA point to \r\na stagnation in the medium term. At the same time, \r\nthere appears to be no light at the end of the tunnel \r\nas far as the Doha Development Round of the World \r\nTrade Organization is concerned. Stunted market \r\naccess for developing countries is exacerbated by rising \r\nprotectionist tendencies in the developed countries and \r\nfalling levels of foreign direct investment.\r\nIt is evident that if we are to succeed in crafting \r\na transformative development agenda for the post-\r\n2015 period, we must craft a strengthened global \r\npartnership to provide adequate and enhanced means \r\nof implementation to developing countries as part of it. \r\nThe urgent fulfilment by developed countries of their \r\ncommitment of 0.7 per cent of gross national income \r\nas ODA should be the starting point for a renewed \r\nand strengthened global partnership for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. The reform of the institutions \r\nof global economic governance to give real voice and \r\nmore than money; and comprehensive — it should cover \r\nall financing sources, whether domestic, international, \r\nprivate or public and innovative financing mechanisms \r\nand should tackle illicit f lows, such as tax evasion. \r\nIt should be integrated — to make the most out of \r\nsynergies between different policy goals; be f lexible \r\nand focused on effective implementation at the country \r\nlevel; and be based on mutual accountability in order \r\nto reflect shared responsibilities. It is important to \r\nrecall that the Monterrey Consensus initiated the global \r\ninternational effectiveness discussions, which are now \r\nled by the Global Partnership for Effective Development \r\nCooperation created in Busan in 2011. The Busan \r\neffectiveness principles provide an important element \r\nto complement the post-2015 discussions on goals, \r\ntargets and financing.\r\nLet me conclude by underlining the importance \r\nthe EU and its member States attach to ensuring \r\nthat the various strands of work in different forums, \r\nsuch as the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts \r\non Sustainable Development Financing, the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nthe United Nations financing for development track all \r\ncome together and contribute to the single post-2015 \r\nframework and set of goals. The challenges are huge \r\nand the means limited. We cannot afford to miss the \r\nsynergies offered by such an integrated approach.\r\nMr. Jaitly (India): It is my distinct honour \r\nto participate in this sixth High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development. We welcome the \r\nopportunity offered by this High-level Dialogue to \r\nreview the status of implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing \r\nfor Development. Coming as it does at a time when \r\nthe international community is giving the final push \r\nto efforts for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and simultaneously commencing \r\ndeliberations for the post-2015 development agenda, the \r\nDialogue is indeed very timely.\r\nAt the outset, let me associate myself with the \r\nstatement made by the Ambassador of Fiji on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nPoverty eradication and sustained and inclusive \r\neconomic growth are the central and overarching \r\npriorities of developing countries. Poverty eradication \r\nis an indispensable requirement for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and inclusive economic growth is a sine \r\nqua non for eradicating poverty and providing a better \r\nquality of life to our people. It is imperative that those \r\n13-50226 19/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nof implementation, particularly financial resources and \r\ntechnology.\r\nWe note and commend the efforts made at both \r\nthe national and international levels in mobilizing \r\nresources for financing for development. Goal 8 of the \r\nMDGs was basically to facilitate the creation of global \r\npartnerships in mobilizing resources for development. \r\nIt was clear that, through the reform of global trade \r\nand financial architectures, further mobilization of \r\nfinancial resources could be secured.\r\nFor over 43 years now, we have had the official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) target of 0.7 per cent of \r\ngross national product (GNP) for developed countries. \r\nTo date, only five countries have achieved or surpassed \r\nthat target. The Monterrey Consensus, which came \r\ninto being soon after the adoption of the MDGs, \r\nreaffirmed that target and apportioned responsibilities \r\nto both national Governments and the international \r\ncommunity on resource mobilization. Among other \r\nthings, developed countries were urged to make \r\nconcrete efforts towards meeting the target of 0.7 per \r\ncent of the GNP as ODA to developing countries and \r\n0.15 to 0.20 per cent of their GNP to the least developed \r\ncountries. That undertaking was reaffirmed in various \r\ninternational conferences, including the fourth United \r\nNations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, \r\nheld in Istanbul in May 2011, and recently at the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20).\r\nBoth the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration on Financing for Development underscore \r\nthe importance of mobilizing domestic resources in \r\nachieving economic growth, poverty eradication and \r\nsustainable development. They also stressed in that \r\nregard the value of national ownership and leadership \r\nin developing policies and strategies that include \r\nfinancing, good governance and accountability.\r\nMany developing countries have undertaken bold \r\ninitiatives to mobilize resources domestically. Most \r\nhave established ambitious national development \r\nstrategies for the eradication of poverty and the \r\nachievement of sustainable development. They have \r\nestablished policies and regulatory frameworks that \r\nhave created environments conducive to attracting both \r\ndomestic and foreign investments. Moreover, deliberate \r\nactions have been taken to strengthen good governance, \r\nrule of law, human rights and democratic institutions. \r\nAs a result of those efforts, the economies of developing \r\ncountries are growing steadily, as attested to by the fact \r\nparticipation to developing countries must also figure \r\nas part of the new global partnership.\r\nSouth-South cooperation has increasingly \r\ncomplemented global development cooperation in \r\nrecent years, even as large developing countries \r\nthemselves face increased development challenges of \r\ntheir own. However, unlike North-South aid, South-\r\nSouth cooperation is a voluntary partnership guided by \r\nits own principles. It must therefore remain free from \r\nexternally imposed norms drawn from North-South \r\nassistance. It can be neither a substitute for North-South \r\naid nor a pretext for diluting existing aid commitments.\r\nThe need for a supportive international economic \r\nenvironment, enhanced investment f lows, a supportive \r\nmultilateral trade regime and a strengthened framework \r\nfor the transfer of technology in order to foster and \r\nsustain inclusive growth and job creation in developing \r\ncountries has never been greater.\r\nThe financing for development process is a key \r\npillar of the global development agenda. Its fundamental \r\ncreed of ensuring enhanced and predictable financial \r\nresource f lows to assist developing countries in \r\npursuing their development priorities is in fact all the \r\nmore relevant today and will remain so in the post-\r\n2015 period. It is imperative that we ensure the full and \r\nurgent implementation of the commitments enshrined \r\nin the financing for development process.\r\nMr. Maalim (United Republic of Tanzania): We \r\nwelcome the convening of this important High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development and thank \r\nboth the President of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecretary-General for their introductory remarks on \r\nthis subject.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Fiji, Benin and \r\nEthiopia speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, the least developed countries and the African \r\nGroup, respectively.\r\nThis High-level Dialogue is taking place at a time \r\nwhen the United Nations and the entire world are \r\nfocusing their attention on two important processes: \r\naccelerating progress for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) within the remaining \r\nperiod of less than 800 days before the 2015 deadline; \r\nand discussions on the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nWe would like to underscore that the most important \r\ncommon denominator in the achievement of the current \r\nMDGs and any future development agenda is the means \r\n20/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nin such areas as agriculture can lift thousands out of \r\npoverty while ensuring food security and nutrition for \r\nTanzania and its neighbours. Initiatives such as the \r\nSouthern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania \r\nare a step in the right direction for my country.\r\nI have highlighted just a few of the issues raised \r\nin the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration \r\non Financing for Development. However, the remaining \r\nissues, namely, international trade, international \r\nfinancial and technical cooperation for development, \r\nexternal debt and systemic issues, also deserve our \r\nundivided attention. We trust that ample time will be \r\nprovided for addressing those issues, including those \r\nrelevant to the World Trade Organization Ministerial \r\nConference to be held in Bali in December, which we \r\nhope will provide a way out of the current impasse \r\nin the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations. \r\nTanzania will unhesitatingly continue to speak out on \r\nthat important subject.\r\nMr. Sergeev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian delegation welcomes the holding \r\nof the sixth High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. Along with the special spring meetings \r\nof the Economic and Social Council, the International \r\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank, the World Trade \r\nOrganization and the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development, dialogue plays a key role \r\nin coordinating the follow-up to the international \r\nconferences that took place in Monterrey and Doha. We \r\nfeel that the current high-level meeting will promote \r\ngreater coherence between various financing for \r\ndevelopment processes and will also provide useful \r\ninput to the work of agreeing upon priorities for global \r\nsocioeconomic cooperation in the post-2015 period.\r\nWe believe that a conceptual framework for \r\nmultilateral cooperation to mobilize resources \r\nis essential if we are to ensure the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of all countries, as determined in the \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development. The tools provided for in \r\nthose seminal documents allow for effective responsess \r\nto new development challenges, including systemic \r\ndisparities in the global economy, increased threats to \r\nglobal energy and food security and the negative effects \r\nof climate change.\r\nIn our opinion, the most immediate tasks in \r\nthe post-Monterrey agenda are ensuring that donor \r\ncommunity commitments to providing assistance \r\nto countries in need are kept; combating trade and \r\nthat six out of the 10 fastest-growing economies in the \r\nworld are in Africa.\r\nDespite those efforts, domestic resources have \r\nproved to be insufficient in themselves, hence the \r\ncontinued relevance of mobilizing international \r\nresources for development, especially private \r\ninternational capital f lows in terms of foreign direct \r\ninvestment. The Rio+20 outcome document, entitled \r\n“The future we want” (resolution 66/288, annex), could \r\nnot be more lucid on that point. The United Republic \r\nof Tanzania is making satisfactory progress in that \r\nregard, with a steady broadening of its tax base; from \r\nJuly 2011 to March 2012 tax revenue collection \r\namounted to 4.7 billion Tanzanian shillings, which \r\nis the equivalent of around $3 billion. Likewise, the \r\nGovernment continues with the implementation of its \r\nNational Economic Empowerment Policy of 2004 by \r\nextending soft loans through 20 empowerment funds, \r\nwith particular emphasis on farmers, women and young \r\nentrepreneurs.\r\nMoreover, the implementation of the National \r\nMicrofinance Policy of 2001 is also under way, with \r\nmillions of Tanzanians gaining access to financial \r\nservices through banks, savings and credit cooperative \r\norganizations and community-based organizations. \r\nMicrofinance services through mobile phone operators \r\nhave given millions of Tanzanians further access to \r\nsuch services.\r\nWe have created a favourable investment climate \r\nthrough, inter alia, the enactment of the Public-\r\nPrivate Partnership Act of 2010 and the designation \r\nof the Tanzania Investment Centre and the Zanzibar \r\nInvestment Promotion Authority as one-stop centres \r\nfor prospective investors. We are putting in place \r\nmechanisms for speeding up the process of setting up a \r\nbusiness so as to attract more businesses and investment \r\nto Tanzania.\r\nDespite the challenges in attracting investment, \r\nwhich in Africa is largely focused on the extractive \r\nindustries, we are witnessing increasing investment \r\nin other sectors such as agriculture, energy, transport, \r\ntelecommunications, health and education. Indeed, \r\nmy Government has identified some of those sectors \r\nas the key drivers of the development that, under the \r\nBig Results Now initiative, will accelerate progress in \r\nachieving the Five-Year Development Plan 2011/12-\r\n2015/16 and the Vision 2025, thus transforming \r\nTanzania into a middle-income country. We believe \r\nthat, through sustainable partnerships, investments \r\n13-50226 21/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nconstructive interaction with a wide range of partners \r\nin the interest of the full and timely implementation of \r\nthe global socioeconomic agenda.\r\nGuided by the principles of solidarity and global \r\npartnership, Russia is consistently increasing its \r\ncontribution to international development assistance. \r\nIn 2012, the volume of Russian assistance to developing \r\ncountries, excluding debt write-offs, totalled about \r\n$460 million, which is in line with the benchmarks \r\nlaid down in the concept of Russia’s participation \r\nin international development assistance. Given the \r\npresence of positive socioeconomic factors, we will \r\nstrive to achieve the target recommended by the United \r\nNations to allocate not less than 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income to official development assistance.\r\nMr. Laram (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nlet me convey to Ambassador John Ashe, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, my \r\nappreciation for convening this High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development. I also want to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his statement.\r\nThis meeting is of particular importance as a follow-\r\nup to the outcome of the International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, \r\nMexico, in 2002, and the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, held \r\nin Doha in 2008. The Monterrey Conference was an \r\nimportant turning point in international cooperation for \r\ndevelopment. Developing and developed countries met \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations to agree on a \r\nbold and ambitious strategy for development. Developing \r\ncountries also assumed their own responsibilities \r\nwith regard to development and domestic resource \r\nmobilization, and made commitments to develop \r\nfinancial and socioeconomic strategies to attain those \r\ngoals.\r\nFor their part, donors agreed to provide greater \r\nassistance, improve the terms of trade and alleviate \r\ndebt. Developing countries were given a greater \r\nshare in decision-making in the international \r\ndevelopment system. Many developed countries also \r\nmade commitments to increase official development \r\nassistance (ODA) substantially. Other developed \r\ncountries undertook commitments, in line with the \r\nMonterrey Consensus, to provide greater assistance \r\nto financing development through the signing of \r\nagreements to alleviate debt, fight corruption and \r\nestablish various policies. The Doha Conference \r\ninvestment protectionism; creating new, fairer and \r\nmore transparent international financial and economic \r\nsystems, including by expanding the representation of \r\ndeveloping countries and activating their participation \r\nin the work of the leading international financial and \r\ntrade institutions; supporting the poorest countries in \r\ndeveloping and implementing good macroeconomic \r\nand fiscal policies with a view to making the most \r\neffective use of domestic and foreign resources and \r\nensuring debt sustainability; overcoming fragmentation \r\nand duplication of financial development mechanisms, \r\nespecially at the country level; expanding partnership \r\ncooperation and the search for optimal models of \r\ninteraction with new players in development financing, \r\nincluding ensuring the active involvement of new \r\ndonors in the decision-making processes and developing \r\ninnovative approaches to providing assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nA significant contribution to achieving the targets \r\nof the Conferences on Financing for Development \r\nis made by the Group of 20 (G-20), which is playing \r\nan important role in the global economic regulatory \r\nsystem. At the G-20 Summit in St. Petersburg a month \r\nago, the High-level Principles of Long-term Investment \r\nFinancing by Institutional Investors were adopted. \r\nThey are a key factor in ensuring strong, sustained \r\nand balanced economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It was decided to extend the duration of \r\nthe moratorium on protectionist measures. A strategic \r\nframework programme to combat corruption was \r\nadopted, as was a collective action plan to combat tax-\r\nbase erosion and profit-shifting.\r\nAn important consensus was reached on the \r\ndevelopment of a new standard for the multilateral \r\nautomatic exchange of information for tax purposes. A \r\ncomprehensive package of reforms aimed at improving \r\nthe resilience of the financial system was approved and \r\nhas already been implemented.\r\nThe St. Petersburg Development Outlook was \r\napproved. It identifies five priority areas for further \r\nelaboration by the G-20 to assist countries most in \r\nneed. The priorities for developing countries are to \r\nensure food security, increase access to financial \r\nservices and improve financial literacy, create modern \r\ninfrastructure, including energy infrastructure, \r\npromote human resource development and increase the \r\nmobilization of domestic resources.\r\nRussia reaffirms its commitment to international \r\ndevelopment cooperation and is ready to enhance its \r\n22/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nMillennium Development Goal 8, on the global \r\npartnership for development, is of extreme importance \r\nin creating new efforts to fulfil all the Goals. In that \r\ncontext, the measures envisaged in the Johannesburg \r\nPlan of Implementation constitute a main reference \r\npoint for making that a tangible plan, while the \r\nMillennium Declaration is part and parcel of the plan \r\nfor making investment a driving force for growth. In \r\nthat context, developing countries have actively begun \r\nto take on a great range of responsibilities themselves. \r\nHowever, the obstacle remains the lack of financial \r\nresources to attain the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand meet other development targets.\r\nFor its part, Qatar has, through its participation \r\nin cooperation programmes in socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, humanitarian affairs and poverty \r\neradication, proved itself to be a reliable partner.\r\nIn conclusion, the current financing for development \r\ncommitments would, if met, be sufficient for the MDGs \r\nto be achieved in all developing countries, including \r\nin Africa. However, for that to be the case, it is up \r\nto the partners to respect the spirit of Monterrey, as \r\nunderscored at Doha.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Let me, at the \r\noutset, commend the President of the General Assembly \r\nand thank the Secretariat for providing us with the \r\nopportunity to highlight the role of the United Nations \r\non this important issue.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Fiji on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and would like to make the \r\nfollowing remarks in its national capacity.\r\nOne of the key positive outcomes of the Rio de \r\nJaneiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment was the commitment made by all Member \r\nStates and the United Nations system to mainstream \r\ngrowth, social inclusiveness and environmental \r\nsustainability across the sustainable development \r\nagenda. Financing for development must now \r\naccommodate and support a new paradigm for inclusive \r\nand sustainable growth. We welcome the establishment \r\nof the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing and support a \r\nstrategy to facilitate the mobilization of resources and \r\ntheir effective use in achieving sustainable development \r\nobjectives.\r\nWe must strengthen the follow-up and \r\nimplementation framework of the Monterrey Consensus \r\nconcluded with a declaration that reaffirmed the strong \r\ncommitment of developed countries to increase ODA in \r\nspite of the financial crisis.\r\nWe are all aware that this Dialogue is being held \r\ntoday in a context marked by the instability of financial \r\nmarkets and by the difficulties that developing and \r\ndeveloped economies are facing following the global \r\neconomic crisis. That situation threatens to undermine \r\nwhat has been achieved by the international community \r\nto ensure human security and to combat poverty. \r\nGreater efforts are needed to tackle new challenges and \r\nto combat poverty and hunger by 2015. That also means \r\nthat we must step up our efforts to tackle those new \r\nchallenges, whether they are due to the crisis or to other \r\nnew and emerging issues, such as the energy crisis, the \r\nfood crisis or climate change.\r\nWe believe that we can certainly overcome the \r\ncrisis. Nevertheless, its effects are being felt by \r\ndeveloping countries in particular, because of the \r\ndecrease in financing, ODA and investment f lows. \r\nWe should not be fearful on that account. Growth is \r\nfragile, and the economic infrastructure of developing \r\ncountries is extremely fragile owing to a drop in their \r\nexports, the credit freeze and the probability of a new \r\ncycle of debt. Given those countries’ lack of a financial \r\nsurplus with which to promote economic growth, they \r\nwill continue to experience economic, financial and \r\nsocial problems.\r\nAs we all know, the situation in developing \r\ncountries requires trade-expansion measures and new \r\ninvestments. We must improve loan conditions, create \r\nnew financing mechanisms and liberalize the terms of \r\ntrade in a fair manner, as agreed at the fourth ministerial \r\nconference of the World Trade Organization, which \r\ncreated the Doha Round of trade negotiations, which \r\nQatar hosted in 2001.\r\nIn that context, I wish to emphasize that the impasse \r\nin the Doha negotiations constitutes a substantive \r\nthreat to multilateral trade. It is therefore vital that the \r\nDoha Round of negotiations be completed as soon as \r\npossible and be accorded a true development context in \r\nreal terms.\r\nThe global financial system needs to be \r\nrestructured in favour of developing countries to help \r\ncreate conditions to foster investment. The reforms of \r\nthose systems must give due weight to the developing \r\ncountries, given their role and responsibility in the \r\nglobal trade and financial system. Without a doubt, \r\n13-50226 23/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nEvery single MDG is a priority in its own right and \r\nmust be financed accordingly. We need to carry that \r\ncommitment forward into the post-2015 agenda in \r\norder to forge a global consensus. Brazil is convinced \r\nthat foreign direct investment and private financial \r\nresources will have a greater impact if more coherent \r\npolicies — policies that are respectful of national \r\npriorities and Government structures — are put in place. \r\nSocial priorities and environmental sustainability must \r\nshape international trade and investment regimes and \r\nbe supported by innovation and property rights systems \r\nwith a strong development perspective.\r\nOur experience in Brazil and in our region shows \r\nthat national and regional development banks have \r\na key role to play in financing social and physical \r\ninfrastructure projects, as well as regional integration. \r\nThey must be strengthened and their local ownership \r\nand governance made more effective and accountable.\r\nInnovative financing mechanisms such as the \r\nInternational Drug Purchase Facility and the Global \r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization have proved \r\nthemselves as valuable tools. Those innovative \r\nsuccess stories should be thoroughly considered by \r\nthe Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing.\r\nThe eradication of poverty and hunger, together \r\nwith social inclusion, must remain the overarching \r\nobjective of the sustainable development goals in a post-\r\n2015 development agenda. Achieving that objective by \r\n2030 is doable, provided that international support is \r\nforthcoming. It is of paramount importance that the \r\nnew expanding global middle class of the North and \r\nthe South, as well as those less fortunate who are still \r\nwaiting to be uplifted from poverty and want, are given \r\na chance to live in a more just and sustainable world. \r\nThat requires more sustainable patterns of production \r\nand consumption: a shared goal that must stand out in a \r\ntransformational post-2015 agenda.\r\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the United Nations proved itself \r\ncapable of living up to the challenges of our time. It is \r\nnow up to us to deliver the future we want.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): At the outset, I wish to \r\nalign Indonesia’s position on this issue with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the Permanent Representative of \r\nFiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nSince our last Dialogue, in 2011, systemic problems \r\nin the global economy have persisted, with no sure \r\nsign of their being resolved. Nevertheless, reassuring \r\nand the Doha Declaration through a more integrated \r\napproach to development in order to provide enhanced \r\ncoordination and coherence among the many financing \r\nstructures and facilities. We are seriously concerned \r\nabout the present fragmentation and verticalization \r\nof financing mechanisms. A proper response must \r\nbe built on the basis of open consultations among all \r\nMember States and other important stakeholders in an \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process.\r\nThe transition towards a more integrated \r\nsustainable development will undoubtedly require \r\nadditional, predictable and stable f lows of resources. \r\nSince Monterrey, developing countries have made \r\nsignificant strides to mobilize additional domestic \r\nresources for development on their own. Many of those \r\ncountries, Brazil among them, have actively sought to \r\nprioritize distributive public policies and conditioned \r\ncash-transfer programmes in pursuit of poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development. We are of \r\nthe view that resources allocated to social programmes \r\nshould be considered investment, and not be accounted \r\nfor as expenditures or public debt. From an integrated \r\nperspective, social justice and sustainable development \r\nwill be the responsibility of everyone — from \r\nGovernments to companies, from the international \r\ncommunity to individuals. That requires a new global \r\npartnership.\r\nFirst, we need global economic and financial \r\ngovernance that respects policy space and domestic \r\npublic-policy choices, taking into account the central \r\nrole of Governments.\r\nSecondly, we must recognize that official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) will continue to play \r\nan important role in eradicating poverty and hunger. \r\nUnfortunately, levels of ODA have been falling for the \r\nsecond year in a row. In fact, they may have fallen further \r\nthan announced, given the accounting and reporting \r\nmechanism used by the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development to measure the degree \r\nof concessionality, which tends to overestimate official \r\ndevelopment assistance f lows. We call on all developed \r\npartners to meet their commitments to dedicate 0.7 per \r\ncent of gross domestic product to ODA, including \r\n0.15 per cent and 0.20 per cent specifically to least \r\ndeveloped countries. \r\nAccelerating progress on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) must translate into an \r\nacross-the-board increase in ODA and not distract \r\nthe international community from its obligations. \r\n24/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nfinancing for development follow-up conference before \r\nwe decide on the new development agenda after 2015. \r\nSuch a conference is important as a point of convergence \r\nfor all processes related to financing for development, \r\nincluding sustainable development, which will support \r\npreparations for the means of implementing the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nFinally, with the recovery of advanced economies \r\ngaining momentum, we believe there is an ample \r\nwindow of opportunity to enable a refreshed approach \r\nthat would take our financing for development agenda \r\nto the next level.\r\nMr. Momen (Bangladesh): We are discussing the \r\nimportant issue of financing for development in a high-\r\nlevel context, at the beginning of a new session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. That in itself is a reflection of the \r\nimportance we attach to this subject. The main theme \r\nfor this event goes beyond the Monterrey Consensus \r\nand the Doha Declaration. It also encompasses the \r\naggregate outcomes of the major United Nations \r\nconferences and summits.\r\nWhile assessing the results and comparing them \r\nagainst pledges, we need to keep in mind all the \r\ncommitments made in the different high-level events \r\nin recent years and objectively determine the status of \r\npromises. In that regard, my delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the interventions made earlier by Fiji on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and by Benin on behalf of \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs). As they mentioned, \r\nwe must seek to identify ways to ensure that the \r\ndecisions taken in Monterrey, Doha and elsewhere are \r\nimplemented efficiently and urgently.\r\nLet me quickly refer to a few points to flag the views \r\nand concerns of Bangladesh before the Assembly. \r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\nfollow-up to and implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment (A/68/357). It is really useful, and we \r\nthank the Secretariat for a job well done.\r\nFirst of all, let me touch on the issue of trade. In \r\nboth Monterrey and Doha, our leaders recognized \r\ninternational trade as an engine of development. \r\nUnfortunately, we have yet to see real-life action to \r\nrealize that recognition by the global leaders. For more \r\nthan a decade, LDCs have been promised duty-free, \r\nquota-free market access for all their products to all \r\ndeveloped countries. Unfortunately, we are still far \r\nfrom reaching that goal. Sadly, even today LDCs face \r\nindications of recovery are slowly emerging. Growth in \r\nsome developed countries gives hope for a stable global \r\nrecovery in the years to come. However, the growth in \r\nemerging economies has weakened. Their economic \r\nslowdowns and financial contraction alarm us all.\r\nDespite the resilience of emerging economies in \r\nthe wake of the 2008 crisis, the foundations of their \r\neconomic development are not strong enough to bear \r\nthe burden of stabilizing the overall global economy. \r\nEssentially, this is because of certain obstacles in the \r\nglobal economy and the financial market that affect \r\nemerging economies, among other things. First, the \r\nvolatility of the global financial and the economic \r\ncrisis increases the number and vulnerability of the \r\npoor, which weakens domestic growth. Secondly, a \r\nlack of transparency in global economic governance \r\nmakes it challenging to coordinate policies. Because \r\nof our interconnected and interdependent economies, \r\nintentions need to be communicated more clearly. For \r\nthose reasons, international cooperation, collaboration \r\nand coordination between developed and developing \r\ncountries remain relevant.\r\nInternational cooperation in financing for \r\ndevelopment is even more essential to support today’s \r\nnascent global recovery. For cooperation to be relevant \r\nand meaningful to our efforts, it should cover both aid \r\nand beyond-aid agendas. This cooperation should be \r\nbuilt on the lessons learned from development practices \r\nand should honour existing commitments. It should also \r\nbe based on robust engagement rooted in good faith, \r\nmutual respect and accountability.\r\nWith unresolved systemic problems and uncertainty \r\nin the global economy, a lot of hope has been pinned on \r\ncollaboration. It is imperative to go back and honour \r\nthe spirit and principles of the Monterrey Consensus, as \r\nunderscored in the Doha Declaration. More importantly, \r\nthere needs to be a push for a meaningful reform of \r\nthe global financial architecture, making provisions \r\nfor innovative financing and achieving fair trade. \r\nMeeting all the targets and commitments under the six \r\npillars of the Monterrey Consensus in a balanced and \r\ncomplementary way enables developing countries to \r\nsustain a cycle of prosperity, thereby contributing to \r\ndurable global economic stability.\r\nThe successful completion of the MDGs and of any \r\nglobal development agenda beyond 2015 depends on the \r\nimplementation of our global commitment to financing \r\nfor development. In that connection, we strongly urge \r\nthat through this Dialogue we emphasize the need for a \r\n13-50226 25/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nhighlighted climatic vulnerability. Bangladesh, being \r\na climate-vulnerable country, calls on development \r\npartners to mitigate the impacts of climate change. A \r\nsea-level rise of one metre would result in the inundation \r\nof almost one third of my country, and the uprooting or \r\ndisplacement of 30 million to 40 million Bangladeshis \r\nfrom their homes, traditional jobs and professions. It \r\nis urgent that the global community step forward to \r\naddress the issue together.\r\nAnother important issue for my delegation is that \r\nof remittances. In Monterrey, Doha and elsewhere, \r\nremittances were recognized as a key component of \r\nand a vehicle for development in poorer countries, \r\nand global leaders pledged to work towards reducing \r\nthe cost of transferring remittances. Last week, the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly organized a High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Migration and Development here \r\nat the United Nations, at which stakeholders pledged \r\nto reduce remittance costs and make the system more \r\nefficient, cost-effective and meaningful. We must fulfil \r\nthose commitments.\r\nFinally, I would like to renew Bangladesh’s \r\ncommitment to a pro-people, pro-planet, equitable, \r\ninclusive and sustainable development agenda. My \r\ndelegation is always ready to assist all stakeholders in \r\nensuring that financing for development is truly for \r\ndevelopment for all.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to thank and commend the President for convening \r\nthis sixth High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment.\r\nLibya would also like to align itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Fiji on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China, and with the statement \r\nby the representative of Ethiopia on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States.\r\nThe United Nations has held important international \r\nmeetings on development, including the International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, held in \r\nMonterrey in 2002. At that conference we arrived \r\nat a consensus on many measures for mobilizing \r\ninternational financial resources and improving the \r\ncoordination of monetary systems and international \r\ntrade institutions for development. However, the \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis has had a \r\nnegative impact on the commitments made at \r\nMonterrey and other relevant conferences. Taking into \r\nnon-tariff barriers, trade barrier definitions, stringent \r\nand, in some cases, unrealistic rules of origin, strict \r\nsanitary and phytosanitary measures and myriad other \r\nbarriers to trade. No wonder the global share of LDCs \r\nin global trade is very low, at around 1 per cent.\r\nLet me share a simple fact. In 1971 there were only \r\n25 LDCs, and their share of global trade was around \r\n1 per cent. Today, there are 49 LDCs. Unfortunately, \r\ntheir share of global trade still remains probably at \r\nabout 1 per cent. That is very sad for all of us. Not \r\nonly that, but even that trade is concentrated in a few \r\ncountries and a few products. We ask the ministers \r\nand leaders with whom we will be meeting in Bali \r\nthis December to take urgent steps and to come to a \r\ncommon understanding and decision to ensure that \r\nLDCs get duty-free and quota-free access to the global \r\nmarket in an efficient and effective manner.\r\nTo ensure that market access is truly meaningful \r\nand contributes significantly to the development \r\nefforts of LDCs, we need aid for trade and transfer \r\nof technology at an affordable price that will help \r\nLDCs leapfrog into the technology era and thus into \r\nthe manufactured-products market. Otherwise, I am \r\nafraid our goal of graduating half of the LDCS by 2020, \r\nas agreed in the Istanbul Programme of Action, will \r\nremain an unfinished agenda.\r\nThe next priority for us is of course official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA). While the developed \r\ncountries promised to provide 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income (GNI) to LDCS as ODA \r\nmore than a decade ago, we see a declining trend \r\nof ODA to the most vulnerable and marginalized \r\ncountries. In his report, the Secretary-General mentions \r\nthat aid to LDCS has dropped from 0.11 per cent of \r\ndevelopment partners’ GNI in 2011 to 0.10 per cent in \r\n2012. This trend is really alarming. Although we find a \r\nfew donor countries reaching or exceeding their ODA \r\ncommitments — and we thank them for it — we are \r\nconcerned to see that most of the larger donors reduced \r\ntheir ODA in 2012, although we do use aid efficiently.\r\nWe must also look critically at the quality of aid. \r\nWe need to follow the guidance of Monterrey and Doha, \r\nwhere it was stressed that ODA should be demand-\r\ndriven, with country ownership.\r\nAlthough the Monterrey Consensus did not \r\nspecifically address the issue of climate change, the \r\nDoha Declaration and, of course, the outcome document \r\nof the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\n26/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nout, the financing needs for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and sustainable development will be extremely \r\nlarge, far exceeding public-sector resources. Yet more \r\nthan five years after the global financial crisis, the world \r\neconomy continues to be plagued by vulnerabilities \r\nand an uneven recovery. It is against that complicated \r\nbackdrop that we are addressing the issue of financing \r\nfor development for the post-2015 era. I would like to \r\nshare the views of the Republic of Korea, focusing on \r\nfive key points.\r\nFirst, I would like to recall that at the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development our \r\nleaders recognized that in order to promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we need significant mobilization of \r\nresources from a variety of sources and effective use of \r\nfinancing. The Republic of Korea believes that should \r\nserve as a guiding principle in our future deliberations \r\non development financing. To respond to the current \r\ntask of poverty eradication and to new challenges such \r\nas climate change and growing inequalities, we need \r\nto mobilize private, public, domestic and international \r\nresources. We must also ensure the effectiveness for \r\ndevelopment of all financial resources, particularly \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA), by increasing \r\ntheir stability and predictability.\r\nSecondly, each country is primarily responsible for \r\nits own development, and the bulk of each country’s \r\npublic resources for development should come from \r\ndomestic resource mobilization. The Republic of Korea’s \r\nown development experience shows that, ultimately, \r\ndomestic resource mobilization is driven by inclusive \r\nand sustained economic growth and that such growth is \r\nachieved by effective development strategy and policy. \r\nWe also note that many developing countries have the \r\ncapacity to mobilize a significant amount of additional \r\nresources through taxation. In that regard, efforts to \r\nfight corruption, tax evasion and illicit financial f lows \r\nshould be strengthened at both the domestic and global \r\nlevels.\r\nThirdly, I emphasize that ODA remains a crucial \r\ncomponent of development financing, particularly for \r\ncountries in special situations, including least developed \r\ncountries. It is also an important means of leveraging \r\nprivate financing for sustainable development. The \r\ndecline in ODA over the past two years is of great \r\nconcern to all of us. Therefore, the Republic of Korea is \r\ncommitted to scaling up its ODA volume. In 2012, we \r\nexpanded our ODA by more than 17 per cent, achieving \r\nthe highest rate of increase among the member \r\naccount the difficulties involved in achieving those \r\ncommitments, and in order to reaffirm the objectives \r\nand commitments of the Monterrey Consensus, in 2008 \r\nthe United Nations held the Follow-up International \r\nConference on Financing for Development to Review \r\nthe Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, in \r\nDoha. Those objectives included an increase in aid \r\nfor development in a partnership based on reciprocal \r\nresponsibility and strengthening capacities for peace, \r\nsecurity, good governance and democracy.\r\nGiven the close links between economic growth \r\nand the mobilization of local resources, the effect of \r\nthe economic crisis on sustainable development is \r\naffecting domestic resource mobilization in developing \r\ncountries. A global economic system founded on \r\njustice and equity is therefore essential — a system that \r\ndeveloping countries can participate in so as to ensure \r\ntheir economic stability and one that protects the world \r\nfrom economic and financial crises.\r\nI should add that when a high level of unemployment \r\nis hindering the mobilization of domestic resources, it \r\nis essential to take coordinated measures to combat the \r\nlack of jobs and create opportunities for work so that \r\nall who are looking for work may find it, and to create \r\nbeneficial local conditions that encourage both foreign \r\nand domestic investment.\r\nIn addition, international trade has seen rises and \r\nfalls since the international economic crisis began, and \r\nthe inability to conclude the Doha Development Round \r\nnegotiations has affected developing countries that \r\ndepend on international trade for financial support in \r\nimplementing their development plans. Therefore, we \r\nmust conclude the Doha Round in order to create a just, \r\nnon-discriminatory international trade system that can \r\nensure financial resources for the developing countries \r\nthat need them.\r\nIn that connection, the 2012 United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development recommended \r\nthat a financial committee be created to find financing \r\nresources for development. We hope that committee \r\nwill be able to fulfil its responsibilities and lead \r\nto the appropriation of resources for financing for \r\ndevelopment, so that the aspirations of developing \r\ncountries can be better coordinated with global \r\nmultilateral partners.\r\nMs. Paik Ji-ah (Republic of Korea): As the report \r\nof the Secretary-General on modalities of the financing \r\nfor development follow-up process (A/67/353) points \r\n13-50226 27/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\ncommitments that have been made despite the \r\neconomic and financial challenges that face the \r\nglobal economy. Those include the second wave of the \r\ninternational financial and economic crisis, which has \r\nled to sovereign debt crises, a decline in employment \r\nand an increase in energy and food prices. All that has \r\nweighed down developing countries and made it harder \r\nfor them to create job opportunities, reduce poverty \r\nand achieve economic and social development. Those \r\nchallenges sorely test the credibility of the commitment \r\nto strengthen international development partnerships. \r\nThey require global efforts to attain the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), that have been reaffirmed \r\nin numerous international forums, most recently in \r\nthe Assembly’s special event to follow up on efforts \r\nmade towards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, held on 25 September.\r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, all of us reaffirmed the need to face \r\nnew, existing and emerging challenges in the area of \r\nsustainable development. That will not occur without \r\nthe mobilization of financial resources to strengthen \r\nthe efforts of developing countries. We therefore \r\nwelcome the establishment of a global expert group to \r\ndraft an international strategy to finance sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We firmly believe that neither the \r\nMDGs, the sustainable development goals nor the post-\r\n2015 agenda, which is currently under discussion, can \r\nbe achieved without strengthening the international \r\ndevelopment partnerships among developing and \r\ndeveloped countries, and among countries across \r\nthe South. There must also be partnerships among \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental sectors and civil \r\nsociety to strengthen development efforts in developing \r\ncountries by mobilizing additional resources to finance \r\ndevelopment in energy, food security and climate \r\nchange, as well as to achieve the goals and commitments \r\nset forth in the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration.\r\nDeveloping countries are making a concerted effort \r\nto implement the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration by allocating a large part of their domestic \r\nresources for strategic development. Those countries \r\nare pursuing sound macroeconomic policies to achieve \r\ntheir development goals in accordance with national \r\npriorities, and are working to advance good governance \r\nand transparency. However, success at the national \r\nlevel also requires appropriate levels of international \r\ninvolvement that reflect the crucial importance of \r\ncountries of the Development Assistance Committee \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment.\r\nFourthly, the Republic of Korea, as a member \r\nof the Leading Group on Innovative Financing for \r\nDevelopment, welcomes the efforts made thus far to \r\nmobilize new forms of resources. I am pleased to report \r\nthat in support of such innovation, Korea has extended \r\nits air-ticket solidarity levy until 2017. New funds \r\nfor climate financing, including the Green Climate \r\nFund, should also be considered in the broader global \r\nframework of financing for sustainable development. \r\nAs the host country, the Republic of Korea is ready \r\nto work with other Member States for the smooth \r\nlaunching and early actualization of the Fund.\r\nLastly, a new development agenda and landscape \r\ndemands a renewed global partnership for development. \r\nThat renewed global partnership should be a much \r\nbroader form of cooperation that extends beyond mere \r\nmobilization of financial resources. It should be an \r\ninclusive and f lexible multi-stakeholder global platform \r\nand must engage all development actors, including civil \r\nsociety and the private sector.\r\nThe Republic of Korea believes that the Busan \r\nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation, \r\nwhich was launched in June 2012, can contribute to the \r\nrenewal and the strengthening of global partnership \r\nfor development — for example, by serving as the \r\nmechanism for global mutual accountability. The \r\nfirst ministerial-level meeting of the Busan Global \r\nPartnership, to be held in Mexico in April 2014, and \r\nthe Development Cooperation Forum high-level \r\nsymposium to be held in Korea in 2015 will contribute \r\nto the advancement of a global partnership for \r\ndevelopment, as well as to the interaction between the \r\nBusan Partnership process and the post-2015 process.\r\nI reiterate the strong commitment of the Republic of \r\nKorea to constructively engage in international efforts \r\non financing for development and global partnership \r\nfor development.\r\nMr. Mootaz Ahmadein Khalil (Egypt) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, my delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of Fiji \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and with the \r\nstatement by the representative of Ethiopia on behalf of \r\nthe African Group.\r\nThe High-level Dialogue on Financing for \r\nDevelopment is the main forum for reviewing the \r\n28/29 13-50226\r\nA/68/PV.29 07/10/2013\r\nprocesses. We also reiterate the importance of the United \r\nNations maintaining the primary role in monitoring the \r\nprogress that is hoped for, with the support of all other \r\nmechanisms, forums and bodies.\r\nFifthly, Egypt hopes for consensus among Member \r\nStates on the holding of another conference to review \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration \r\nand to identify any obstacles to their implementation \r\nand the means of dealing with such obstacles. Such a \r\nconference must be held in the near future in order to \r\nallow for its outcomes to be taken into account in the \r\nprocess of setting out the post-2015 United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nEgypt, like other developing countries, has suffered \r\nfrom the effects and challenges of the food crisis, the \r\nenergy crisis and the international financial crisis. As \r\na developing country and a net importer of food, Egypt \r\nhas seen its economy affected by challenges having \r\nto do with the resources needed to improve living \r\nconditions and guarantee justice and social integration \r\nwhile ensuring the conditions necessary to strengthen \r\nEgypt’s current democratic transformation. There is \r\nno doubt that implementing the five proposals I just \r\nmentioned would contribute to finding solutions to the \r\nchallenges facing many developing countries.\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): I am mindful of the \r\nclock, and therefore a full version of my comments will \r\nbe available at a later stage.\r\nNew Zealand welcomes this opportunity to review \r\nefforts to achieve the objectives of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and Doha Declaration — objectives that \r\nremain very relevant as work begins on the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. Many have noted the need \r\nto address implementation issues from the outset, \r\nparticularly for the sustainable development goals. \r\nWhat is already very evident is that a business-as-usual \r\napproach will not be enough. We must use all options \r\nthat might be available for mobilizing financing. Most \r\nof those options were recognized at Monterrey and \r\nDoha, but they have yet to achieve their full potential.\r\nDespite the global financial crisis and the \r\npatchy recovery from it, New Zealand’s own official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) levels remain fairly \r\nstable. Indeed, we can now project an increase as the \r\nGovernment’s accounts move back into fiscal balance.\r\nDevelopment effectiveness and donor coordination \r\nare key to getting value from every single ODA \r\ndollar. In our own region, the Pacific Islands Forum \r\ndevelopment in the international agenda, as well as the \r\ninternational will to further such actions.\r\nDeveloped countries must honour their \r\ncommitments, especially their official development \r\nassistance (ODA) contributions of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income. At the Gleneagles Summit, the Group \r\nof Eight spoke of the need to increase ODA to Africa \r\nand of the importance of honouring their political \r\ndeclaration on the needs of Africa. However, none of \r\nthose commitments has yet been achieved.\r\nVarious actions must be undertaken to put \r\ninnovative mechanisms in place. However, we believe \r\nthat the resources resulting from those mechanisms \r\nshould be in addition to and complementary to those \r\nderived from traditional resources such as ODA, and \r\nthat they should not be considered a substitute for \r\nthose traditional resources. In that regard, we believe \r\nthat we must first strengthen the role of international \r\ntrade development and that the ninth ministerial \r\nconference of the World Trade Organization, to meet \r\nin Bali in December, should adopt measures that will \r\nreaffirm and activate the mandate of the Doha Round \r\nand improve the access of developing countries to \r\ninternational markets.\r\nSecondly, we request that an international \r\nmechanism be established for all countries, both \r\ncreditors and debtors, to implement a global approach \r\nto debt, including the debt of medium-sized countries, \r\nwhile dealing with the negative impact that the \r\ninternational financial crisis has had on those countries’ \r\ninability to pay their foreign debts.\r\nThirdly, we request that coordinated and serious \r\ninternational efforts be undertaken to take clear \r\nmeasures to repatriate f leeing capital to the countries of \r\norigin. The return of such resources will strengthen the \r\ndevelopment efforts of developing countries and will \r\nassist in combating corruption and organized crime, \r\nwhich undermine development efforts.\r\nFourthly, we ask that the participation and \r\nrepresentation of developing countries be enhanced \r\nin international decision-making processes, so that \r\nthe required reforms are undertaken in the economic \r\nand financial international systems. In that regard, \r\nwe reiterate how important it is for there to be fair \r\nrepresentation for developing countries, in particular \r\nthose in Africa, in all informal multi-stakeholder, \r\nmultilateral global entities and mechanisms involved in \r\ninternational economic and financial decision-making \r\n13-50226 29/29\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.29\r\nworld’s disadvantaged is to create a framework within \r\nwhich they could trade effectively. We therefore agree \r\nwith Qatar, Brazil, Bangladesh and others that we \r\nmust intensify efforts to move forward with the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda process, including by achieving a \r\nsuccessful outcome at the ninth ministerial conference \r\nof the World Trade Organization, to be held in Bali, \r\nwhich so many have advocated — an outcome that \r\ncould be a stepping-stone towards efforts to conclude \r\nthe wider Doha Development Agenda in the post-Bali \r\nperiod.\r\nOver the next year, we will set the scene for the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. We have already seen \r\nthe Report of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \r\non the Post-2015 Development Agenda. The Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts \r\non Sustainable Development Financing will report \r\nin September 2014. Other bodies and stakeholders, \r\nsuch as the Development Assistance Committee of \r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment and next year’s ministerial level meeting \r\nof the Global Partnership for Effective Development \r\nCooperation, can also contribute. In short, we should \r\nall be open to ideas from all such sources as we work \r\ntogether for a better future for all.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\nCompact — the Cairns Compact on Strengthening \r\nDevelopment Coordination in the Pacific — has \r\nimproved effectiveness, including through its peer \r\nreview mechanism.\r\nTraditional financing mechanisms can now be \r\nsupplemented by new partnerships, including with the \r\nprivate sector. The Busan Forum on Aid Effectiveness \r\nrecognized the need for more inclusive partnerships \r\nbuilt on country ownership. New Zealand has leveraged \r\nits ODA to build different partnerships, including those \r\nfor renewable energy projects that emerged from the \r\nrecent Pacific Energy Summit held in Auckland.\r\nNew Zealand agrees with Belize, speaking earlier \r\non behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States, on the \r\nneed for cooperation, partnership and collective action. \r\nTherefore, against that background, we welcome \r\nthe partnerships theme for the 2014 International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States, to be \r\nheld in Samoa, and particularly note Samoa’s plans to \r\nlaunch a partnership to create jobs for youth. However, \r\nno one size fits all. We must be open to a whole new \r\nand different range of ways of doing things that deliver \r\nresults on the ground regardless of their structures.\r\nTrade remains central to economic growth and \r\nrecovery. One way to advance the position of the \r\n"
