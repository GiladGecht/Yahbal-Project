"In the absence of the President, Mr. Sinhaseni \r\n(Thailand), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development\r\nAgenda item 18 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the 2008 Review Conference\r\nMr. Ružička (Slovakia): I wish to express the \r\nsupport of the Slovak Republic for the efforts to \r\nenhance discussions on one of the most crucial topics \r\nnot only for the United Nations, Member States and \r\nobservers, but above all for every single human being \r\non our planet.\r\nI would like to align my statement with that \r\ndelivered by the observer of the European Union earlier \r\n(see A/68/PV.29).\r\nDiscussions on how to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015 and on defining \r\nthe post-2015 sustainable development agenda, \r\nincluding the important issue of effective, transparent \r\nand sufficient financing, should be a focal point of our \r\nefforts in the coming months and years. Time is not \r\nour ally, and neither are the global trends, be they man-\r\nmade or the result of a natural cycle.\r\nAchieving sustainable development is a great \r\nchallenge for this century. Efforts to address the \r\nthree pillars of development — economic, social and \r\nenvironmental — should take into account global \r\nchallenges and local needs and possibilities in one set \r\nof goals.\r\nThe success of sustainable development will depend \r\non United Nations coherence and accountability. Global \r\npartnership and strong political leadership are needed \r\nin the context of achieving sustainable development in \r\nthe framework of a post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment underscored the need for creative \r\napproaches to global financing for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. This complex topic is now being \r\nconsidered by a special Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing. I \r\nam pleased to represent my country on that Committee, \r\nwhich began its work at the end of August.\r\nAs a result of the economic crisis, the resources for \r\ndevelopment are limited. It is clear that public resources \r\nalone are not sufficient for achieving sustainable goals. \r\nThis situation requires a more innovative, creative and \r\nopen-minded approach from every single actor and \r\nstakeholder. We have to focus our attention on new \r\nforms of financing, including global and private funds. \r\nWe have to discuss more seriously the potential of \r\ncarbon taxes, a solidarity levy on air tickets, solidarity \r\ntobacco contributions, voluntary contributions, debt \r\nconvergence and trade issues. One innovative means \r\nof funding development is the blending of resources. \r\nDevelopment assistance will continue to be vital.\r\nIn order to mobilize large-scale financing for \r\ndevelopment, we need more than ever innovative \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.30\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n30th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 7 October 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Let \r\nme briefly highlight a few themes.\r\nFirst, our ability to accelerate the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to set an \r\nambitious development agenda after 2015 will depend \r\non our mobilizing a wide range of financial f lows for \r\ndevelopment and getting the most development impact \r\nout of them.\r\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) will remain \r\ncrucial, particularly for sectors and countries for which \r\nODA remains essential in the drive to eradicate extreme \r\npoverty. That is why the United States disbursed \r\nover $30 billion in ODA in 2012, with a strong focus \r\non least developed countries. That is why we have \r\ninvested nearly $9 billion a year to fight global disease, \r\nparticularly working with partners to achieve an \r\nAIDS-free generation. That is also what underpins our \r\ninvestments in food security through Feed the Future \r\nand in energy through Sustainable Energy for All and \r\nPower Africa. All of those testify to the United States’ \r\ncommitment to target official development assistance \r\nin a catalytic way to achieve development results that \r\nlast.\r\nBut ODA is increasingly only a small part of the \r\ndevelopment story, and we need to give fresh thought \r\nto ways to boost private investment and help countries \r\nstrengthen their domestic revenue streams. The number \r\nof countries for which ODA is the dominant source \r\nof international resources has dropped precipitously \r\nsince 1990, by some estimates from 95 to 43 countries. \r\nThose countries for which foreign direct investment \r\nis the dominant international financial f low have \r\nmeanwhile doubled to approximately 50 countries, and \r\nmore and more countries have set goals for reducing \r\nor eliminating dependence on development assistance.\r\nToday, ODA represents a fraction of total \r\ninternational resource f lows to developing countries, \r\nand domestic resource f lows annually far outstrip \r\ninternational f lows. International f lows themselves are \r\nnow dominated by private investment and remittances. \r\nTrade f lows, which also have enormous potential to \r\nlessen poverty and improve people’s well-being, have \r\nalso expanded, and trade volume among developing \r\ncountries has significantly increased.\r\nThat is all good news. Of course, the optimal mix \r\nof resource and trade f lows will vary quite significantly \r\npublic-private partnerships. We have to give greater \r\nsupport to the idea of private-sector involvement in \r\nthe development agenda, at the domestic, regional and \r\ninternational levels. On the one hand, the Governments \r\nof developing countries may contribute to our efforts \r\nby creating conditions for domestic development and \r\ngrowth, stabilizing economies and supporting small and \r\nmedium-sized companies. On the other hand, private \r\nactors, both domestic and international, are crucial in \r\ncreating more jobs and in assisting in the transfer of \r\nnew technologies to developing countries.\r\nSustainable development will require the leadership \r\nof international and multinational corporations. Their \r\neconomic and political influence and potential to speed \r\nup sustainable development would be essential.\r\nDeveloping countries are capable of taking \r\nresponsibility for their future and for mobilizing funds. \r\nThey are capable of defining their needs so that their \r\nnational ownership of processes can be secured. What \r\nwe need to do is deepen dialogue between donors and \r\nrecipients, tailor global needs to local conditions and \r\nhelp countries in transition to build their capacities.\r\nOne might ask: what can a small country like \r\nSlovakia do? Slovakia has gone from being a recipient \r\nof development assistance to being a donor — a small \r\nand humble donor, but willing to bear our part of \r\nresponsibility for global development. We have been \r\nproviding development assistance since 2003. Over the \r\npast 20 years, we have undergone several transition \r\nperiods, during which we have learned how important it \r\nis to rely on our own resources, combined with foreign \r\naid. We have learned that knowledge-sharing is one of \r\nthe most effective instruments that may serve the needs \r\nof any country going through a political and economic \r\ntransition or transformation.\r\nGlobal trends in demography, migration, climate \r\nand economy are affecting every single country, every \r\nsingle region, every single nation and every single \r\nhuman individual. No one remains unaffected, and \r\nno one should be left out of the process of defining, \r\nadopting and implementing measures to make our \r\nplanet a nice place to live in the twenty-first century \r\nand beyond.\r\nMrs. Robl (United States of America): This sixth \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development \r\nis being convened at a time of significant change and \r\ndynamism in the global development environment. We \r\nhave fresh opportunities to think about the best ways to \r\n13-50232 3/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nthe various types of financing for real and sustained \r\ndevelopment progress. As President Obama noted in his \r\nState of the Union address earlier this year, we have a \r\nhistoric opportunity to eradicate extreme poverty in the \r\nnext two decades. Realizing that opportunity will take \r\nthe concerted effort of all, and we should leave no stone \r\nunturned.\r\nMr. Gave (France) (spoke in French): France \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered earlier by the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nThis sixth High-level Dialogue on Financing \r\nfor Development is of particular importance, for it \r\ntakes place at the start of the sixty-eighth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, where our work will focus on \r\nreviewing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand on the post-2015 agenda. To eradicate poverty \r\nand ensure sustainable development, the international \r\ncommunity must define an ambitious implementation \r\nstrategy that adapts the Monterrey Consensus and the \r\nDoha Declaration for the renewal of the development \r\nparadigm. For France, this evolution will take place in \r\nfive main areas.\r\nFirst, France is dedicated to maintaining the public \r\naid that comes from traditional donors, who must play \r\na central role in catalysing the mobilization of financial \r\nresources, with priority for the least developed countries. \r\nThe world has changed since 2002. New arrangements \r\nhave been imposed on the global economy, new \r\nfinancial f lows have arisen and certain challenges have \r\nbecome increasingly urgent . I am thinking, of course, \r\nof the fight against climate change and the protection \r\nof biodiversity. Our financing for development strategy \r\nmust therefore adapt to those changes through a global \r\npartnership that brings together all development \r\nstakeholders, whether they are public or private, local \r\nor international. France therefore supports the widening \r\nof the circle of donors, which can lead, for example, to \r\nSouth-South cooperation projects and greater sharing \r\nof knowledge among countries with different levels of \r\ndevelopment.\r\nSecondly, France places at the centre of financing for \r\ndevelopment the mobilization of the national resources \r\nof developing countries, in the service of an endogenous \r\ndevelopment and with respect for national ownership. \r\nThat ownership requires strengthening national fiscal \r\ncapacities and combating illicit financial f lows, which \r\ngreatly hinder development in many countries. The \r\ntransparency and efficiency of national tax systems are \r\ntherefore decisive. The universalization of commitment \r\nby country, but these trends mean that we have an \r\nincredible opportunity to be more thoughtful and \r\nsophisticated in thinking about the role of international \r\nand domestic capital trade f lows and of the optimal mix \r\nof public and private investment for ending extreme \r\npoverty and achieving many of the development \r\noutcomes that are collective priorities.\r\nSecondly, we have seen substantial transformation \r\nin the development landscape in the growing role of \r\ndeveloping countries on the global stage. Countries \r\npreviously reliant on assistance to reduce poverty and \r\nimprove basic services today have economies that \r\nare essential drivers of global economic growth. The \r\nrelationship between developed and developing is \r\nmore complex than ever before, with new potential for \r\nmutually beneficial growth and investment.\r\nThirdly, we have a new and widespread recognition \r\nthat twenty-first-century development needs to be \r\nsustainable. We are encouraged by and welcome \r\nthe robust global dialogue now under way on the \r\nsocial, economic and environmental dimensions of \r\ndevelopment, particularly in relation to the post-2015 \r\nagenda. Secretary Kerry noted in his recent address \r\nto the General Assembly that our efforts to improve \r\npeople’s lives around the world mean little if we let \r\nthe planet itself fall into disrepair. That is why we \r\nmust strive for a development agenda that recognizes \r\nthat fighting poverty, combating discrimination and \r\nsafeguarding our environment are absolutely linked \r\ntogether and are not separate endeavours.\r\nFourthly, we have a far-sighted foundation on which \r\nto build in the form of the Monterrey Consensus and the \r\nDoha Declaration. The process launched at Monterrey \r\nforesaw and accounted for many of the changing \r\ndynamics and resource f lows, and we should build on \r\nthose foundations as we go forward. We look forward to \r\nthe contribution of the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing \r\nand to productive discussions on aid transparency and \r\neffectiveness in the Paris/Accra/Busan work stream \r\nin order to help us identify and fill concrete gaps. \r\nWe will also look towards organizations such as the \r\nUnited Nations, the World Trade Organization and the \r\ninternational financial institutions to draw on their core \r\ncompetencies and best ideas to inform our debate.\r\nThe United States welcomes a dynamic and robust \r\ndialogue on financing and resource issues going \r\nforward. That needs to be informed by evidence of \r\nhow the world is changing and must seek to optimize \r\n4/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nparticipate in General Assembly deliberations on this \r\nissue in the coming weeks.\r\nFinancing sustainable development is a common \r\nresponsibility for all. France welcomes the fact that \r\nthe international community agrees on the need for a \r\nsingle agenda, which closely links poverty eradication \r\nand sustainable development. That convergence is also \r\nnecessary in the means of implementation. Getting to \r\nthat point is our duty, but it is also our in our interest, for \r\nit involves the security and stability of our development \r\nmodels.\r\nMr. Lennartsson (Sweden ): Sweden aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the observer of the European \r\nUnion earlier today (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus, as reaffirmed by the \r\nfollow-up conference in Doha, is a landmark agreement \r\non financing for development. The strength of this \r\nglobal partnership lies in its holistic approach. Today \r\nI would like to highlight three key elements of that \r\npartnership, which the international community needs \r\nin order to address the achievement of internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, and to ensure the successful \r\nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nFirst is the issue of mutual accountability. Official \r\ndevelopment assistance (ODA) continues to be critical \r\nas a source of financing for development, in particular \r\nfor the least developed countries, as well as for \r\nsupporting the efforts to tackle the specific development \r\nchallenges of countries in a fragile state or in conflict \r\nsituations. Sweden continues to uphold the 1 per cent \r\nof gross national income (GNI) allocated to ODA. We \r\ncall on donor countries that have not yet lived up to the \r\nODA commitment of 0.7 per cent of GNI to intensify \r\ntheir efforts to do so.\r\nStakeholders also need to ensure that our \r\ndevelopment cooperation efforts are results-oriented, \r\nsustainable, transparent and accountable. Transparent \r\nprocesses, outcome-oriented programming, results-\r\nbased management, effective monitoring and thorough \r\nfollow-up are key to achieving concrete development \r\nresults on the ground for women, men, girls and boys.\r\nThe second key issue is responsible policies. \r\nThe mobilization of domestic resources is the most \r\nimportant component of financing for development. \r\nEach country must take the primary responsibility for \r\nits own development. Each country also must take the \r\nprimary responsibility for the provision of public goods \r\nshould go hand in hand with differentiation, so that \r\neveryone contributes fairly and in accordance with \r\ntheir own resources.\r\nThirdly, mobilizing the private sector is also \r\nessential. Building a sustainable world requires \r\ninvolving private-sector actors in the implementation \r\nof development goals because, on the one hand, private \r\nfinancing constitutes the majority of global financial \r\nf lows and, on the other hand, public-private partnerships \r\nenable the pooling of funds and complementary \r\nexpertise.\r\nFourthly, innovative financing allows the \r\nmobilization of additional sources of financing for \r\nofficial development assistance. The resources from \r\ninnovative financing sources can also be used more \r\nefficiently because programmes respond to local \r\nneeds and are managed in the context of partnerships \r\nthat involve the public sector, non-governmental \r\norganizations, international organizations and the \r\nprivate sector. France calls on the international \r\ncommunity to continue its efforts to change the scales of \r\nexisting initiatives in the area of  innovative financing. \r\nNaturally, nothing in that area should be imposed. It is \r\nfor each State to freely choose a mechanism that suits it \r\nfrom the menu of options.\r\nFifthly, the urgent need to sustainably eradicate \r\npoverty requires an increasingly higher level of \r\nefficiency and accountability in terms of financial \r\ndevelopment policies. The broad range of means that we \r\nwill put at the service of sustainable development must \r\nbe used coherently and in a coordinated manner, guided \r\nby the principles of the Busan Partnership for Effective \r\nDevelopment Cooperation. France therefore renews its \r\ncommitment to less fragmented, more transparent and \r\nresult-oriented aid.\r\nWhile the session that is opening is decisive for \r\ndeliberations on financing for development, France \r\nwill promote its approach in various relevant bodies. \r\nIn particular, it aims to put forward its comprehensive, \r\nrenewed and integrated vision of financing for \r\ndevelopment in the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, \r\nwhich will submit a report to the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember 2014. We also believe that a new conference \r\nto follow up the Monterrey Conference is the pertinent \r\nspace for defining — in particular on the basis of \r\nthe report of the Committee of Experts — the new \r\nfinancial compact, which should be finalized in time \r\nto implement the new development agenda. We will \r\n13-50232 5/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nand innovative power will be crucial. Joint efforts \r\ncharacterized by mutual accountability, national \r\nownership, inclusive partnerships and a focus on \r\ndevelopment results on the ground will determine the \r\nsuccess of the new development agenda.\r\nMr. Thoms (Germany): Let me start by aligning \r\nmyself with the statement delivered on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union and its member States (see A/68/\r\nPV.29).\r\nOver the next two years all development partners \r\nwill have to step up efforts towards the achievement \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. Various \r\nprocesses have started that are aimed at formulating \r\na single, coherent and universally applicable new \r\nagenda for sustainable development beyond 2015. In \r\nthat respect, it is of utmost importance to streamline all \r\ninternational processes that deal with financing issues. \r\nIt will also be vital that the post-2015 goals track and \r\nthe financing track — while remaining separate — be \r\nwell coordinated. That implies that the discussions on \r\nfinancing and the means of implementation at this point \r\nin time should take place first and foremost under the \r\nfinancing track.\r\nThere is a need for the Monterrey Consensus \r\nto evolve into a post-2015 financing for sustainable \r\ndevelopment framework for the mobilization of \r\nfinancial resources in support of the future post-2015 \r\nagenda for sustainable development. What was agreed \r\nalready in Monterrey — the primary importance of \r\nmobilizing domestic resources — will remain valid \r\nalso for the post-2015 process.\r\nGermany supports its partner countries in their \r\nefforts to reform their tax systems, strengthen their \r\ntax administrations and follow the principles of \r\ngood financial-governance rules, including in the \r\ndevelopment of local financial markets. Moreover, we \r\nstrongly back joint efforts to improve tax cooperation \r\nand to combat corruption, illegal capital f lows, tax \r\nevasion and excessive tax-avoidance schemes. We \r\nwelcome the outcome of this year’s Group of Eight and \r\nGroup of 20 Summits, in particular the Lough Erne \r\nDeclaration, including the remarks on base erosion \r\nand profit-shifting and the automatic exchange of \r\ninformation.\r\nOur support for private-sector development seeks \r\nto improve the business and investment climate in order \r\nto promote private investments, generate economic \r\ngrowth and broaden the tax base. Resilient and inclusive \r\nand fair distribution of wealth. A rights-based approach \r\nto national development is key. The accountability \r\nof Governments towards their citizens requires \r\ngood governance and fair, effective and efficient tax \r\nsystems. Here we see a role for the United Nations to \r\nuse its capacity-building functions to assist developing \r\ncountries in broadening their tax base and developing \r\npolicies for the equitable and responsible allocation of \r\nresources.\r\nIllegal outf lows of capital from developing countries \r\nare estimated to be many times greater than the total \r\ndevelopment assistance. Combating such illicit outf lows \r\ncould make a major contribution to freeing up resources \r\nfor investments in development. Moreover, increased \r\nefforts are needed in the fight against corruption. The \r\ninternational financial institutions will be particularly \r\nimportant in that regard, and United Nations bodies \r\nplay an active role through general awareness-raising, \r\nas well as through instruments such as the United \r\nNations Convention against Corruption and the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime.\r\nFinally, looking ahead, we are in the middle of the \r\nworld’s largest conversation: the conversation on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. While we place much \r\nemphasis on the “what”, we must not forget the “how”. \r\nHere, Sweden sees a direct link between the new agenda \r\nand financing for development. A responsible post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda will require an in-depth discussion \r\non financing. Mutual accountability and responsible \r\npolicies constitute important points of departure.\r\nCoherence and coordination among institutions \r\nand processes are crucial. The United Nations and the \r\ninternational financial institutions have complementary \r\nmandates, and we encourage them to coordinate their \r\nefforts more effectively so as to improve the consistency \r\nof global governance for development.\r\nThe changing development landscape comprises \r\nnew challenges, new development instruments and new \r\ndevelopment actors. Global, regional and subregional \r\nintegration efforts such as South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation initiatives should be supported. The \r\nrole of civil society and the private sector in global \r\ndevelopment should be further enhanced.\r\nThe private sector plays a crucial role in mobilizing \r\nresources for development, creating jobs and thinking \r\ninnovatively. Enhanced cooperation with the private \r\nsector and better use of its expertise, resources \r\n6/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nworld. In view of that, the international community \r\nshould take a holistic and long-term view of the question \r\nof financing for development; forge political will at the \r\nglobal, regional and national levels; build and improve \r\na global development partnership characterized by \r\nequality, mutual benefit and win-win results; and \r\nmobilize resources to achieve all the development goals.\r\nIn that respect, the United Nations should play a \r\nleading role. China proposes that efforts be made in the \r\nfollowing areas.\r\nFirst, strong, sustainable and balanced growth of \r\nthe world economy should be promoted. Promoting \r\nglobal economic recovery and growth and realizing the \r\ncommon development and prosperity of all countries \r\nare the fundamental objectives and tasks of cooperation \r\non financing for development. Governments should \r\nadopt responsible macroeconomic policies, engage \r\nin timely communication and coordination and work \r\ntogether to build a world economy in which countries \r\nfind innovative ways to promote development and in \r\nwhich the growth of all countries is interlinked and their \r\ninterests are integrated. In that way, the development of \r\none country will stimulate growth in others and produce \r\npositive instead of negative spillover effects. Countries \r\nshould work together to maintain and develop an open \r\neconomy and make integrated use of international and \r\ndomestic markets and resources.\r\nSecondly, the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration on Financing for Development should \r\nbe effectively implemented. Official development \r\nassistance (ODA) represents an important cornerstone \r\nof international development cooperation and the main \r\nsource of financing for many developing countries. \r\nDeveloped countries should shoulder the primary \r\nresponsibility for financing for development and \r\neffectively fulfil the commitment of devoting 0.7 per \r\ncent of their gross national income to ODA. Developing \r\ncountries should continue to strengthen South-South \r\ncooperation, that is, unite and engage in mutual help \r\nand share development experience so as to supplement \r\nNorth-South cooperation and achieve common \r\ndevelopment. International financial institutions \r\nshould mobilize and coordinate all possible resources \r\nso as to increase input in the field of development. \r\nChina believes that efforts should be scaled up to build \r\nthe follow-up mechanism of the Monterrey Consensus \r\nof the International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and that the follow-up international \r\nconference on financing for development to review the \r\nfinancial systems and markets are a vital component \r\nin those efforts to mobilize domestic resources. We \r\nalso need to strengthen private households’ abilities to \r\nimprove their own living conditions, and we need to \r\nmobilize domestic and international private investments \r\nfor sustainable development. Yet, in addition to that, \r\nall countries are committed to provide — according \r\nto their means — external official financial support to \r\nthose countries that cannot meet all their sustainable \r\ndevelopment needs alone, as well as to contribute to the \r\nprovision of global public goods. The Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing will mark an important milestone in that \r\nprocess.\r\nGermany is actively involved in the work of the \r\nCommittee. We and the German expert, Mr. Kloppenburg \r\nof KfW Development Bank, are committed to \r\nsupporting the Committee to deliver focused, innovative \r\nand action-oriented recommendations in its report to \r\nthe Secretary-General. We are taking part in a crucial \r\nprocess of defining common ground for a liveable \r\nworld. Germany will constructively support the process \r\ntowards the creation of a financing framework for the \r\npost-2015 agenda for sustainable development that \r\nallows all people to live in the “The future we want”.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nWe are facing a complex global economic situation. \r\nWhile the overall situation is looking up, the negative \r\neffects of the international financial crisis linger on, and \r\nthere is still a long way to go before the global economy \r\nfully recovers. Such a complex situation has posed \r\nnumerous challenges to international development \r\ncooperation, such as declining political will, inadequate \r\nresources for development and the deterioration of the \r\ndevelopment environment, and has further brought to \r\nthe fore the difficulties of financing for development. \r\nAgainst such a backdrop, the High-level Dialogue on \r\nFinancing for Development is of particularly great \r\nimportance. I hope that this meeting will help garner \r\npolitical will and mobilize resources so as to advance \r\ninternational cooperation in financing for development.\r\nSteady and adequate financing is key to \r\ndevelopment. Ensuring such support for the \r\nsocioeconomic development of developing countries \r\nwill help with their development, which in turn will \r\nadvance the development and prosperity of the whole \r\n13-50232 7/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\ngrowth. While pursuing its own development, China \r\nhas also assisted other developing countries to the best \r\nof its ability. Since 2000, China has provided assistance \r\nto over 120 developing countries within the framework \r\nof South-South cooperation, built more than 200 \r\nschools and over 30 hospitals and malaria-prevention \r\nand treatment centres, and trained more than 80,000 \r\npeople in various skill categories.\r\nWe are now in the process of implementing initiatives \r\naimed at helping developing countries improve people’s \r\nlives, as well as cancelling debts, strengthening \r\nfinancial, economic, trade and agricultural cooperation \r\nand providing human resources training.\r\nDuring his visit to Africa last March, China’s \r\nPresident Xi announced further initiatives in support \r\nof Africa’s development, including honouring the \r\ncommitment to providing loans to Africa in the amount \r\nof $20 billion within three years, thereby translating \r\ninto reality the partnership for transnational and \r\ntransregional infrastructure development in Africa, \r\nimplementing the African Talents Programme and \r\nincreasing technology transfer to and experience-sharing \r\nwith Africa.\r\nChina stands ready to continue to take an active part \r\nin international financing for development to promote \r\nthe comprehensive implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, thereby contributing to international \r\ndevelopment cooperation.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto congratulate the President for convening the sixth \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development, \r\nwhich is focusing on the status of implementation and \r\nfuture tasks of the outcomes of Monterrey, Doha and \r\nother major United Nations conferences and summits. \r\nMalaysia wishes to align itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representative of Fiji on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.29). I \r\nalso wish to thank the Secretary-General for the timely \r\nand updated report on the same topic (A/68/357), which \r\nhas given us insight into the current state of global \r\nfinancing for development.\r\nThe report highlighted some major concerns \r\nthat are shared by my delegation. As a developing \r\ncountry that had to endure the global financial crisis \r\nin 2008, Malaysia is of the view that the current \r\nprogress made by the international community in \r\naddressing development issues is inadequate. Malaysia \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus should be \r\nheld at an early date.\r\nThirdly, global economic governance should be \r\nimproved. Greater efforts are needed to build a fair, open \r\nand orderly international economic environment so as \r\nto expand cooperation and achieve win-win results. It \r\nis necessary to deepen the reform of the international \r\nfinancial system, increase the representation and voice of \r\nemerging markets and developing countries, strengthen \r\nthe regulation of international financial markets and \r\nbuild a stable and risk-resistant international monetary \r\nsystem. We should safeguard a multilateral trade \r\nsystem that is free, open and non-discriminatory, and \r\nexplore ways to improve rules on global investment and \r\nguide the rational f low of global development capital, \r\nleading to a more effective distribution of development \r\nresources. More should be done to cancel the debts of \r\ndeveloping countries and expand their market access, \r\nprovide them with financial support on a priority basis, \r\nand encourage and support their capacity-building.\r\nFourthly, financing for sustainable development \r\nshould be discussed within the framework of financing \r\nfor development. At present and for the foreseeable \r\nfuture, international development cooperation will \r\nfocus on implementing the outcome document of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) and formulating the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, with financing for \r\ndevelopment and financing for sustainable development \r\nas the core components. The international community \r\nshould, on the basis of a comprehensive assessment of \r\nthe amount of capital needed by developing countries in \r\norder to realize the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals and sustainable development, explore ways to \r\nfinance sustainable development in accordance with \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and with the framework \r\nand principles of financing for development, and \r\nfurther clarify the relationship between financing for \r\ndevelopment and financing for sustainable development. \r\nWith the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing having started \r\nits work in August, we hope that it will soon develop \r\noptions for an effective financing for sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategy.\r\nChina is an active participant in and practitioner \r\nof international financing for development. Since we \r\nassigned development a high priority, we have steadily \r\npushed forward reform, opened up to the outside \r\nworld and achieved stable and relatively fast economic \r\n8/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nof the trade restrictions introduced in 2008 remain in \r\nplace, and only 19 per cent have so far been eliminated. \r\nIn that regard, a fair multilateral trading system is \r\nessential to ensure sustained growth in global trade \r\nand to create new market access and opportunities for \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMalaysia looks forward to the expeditious \r\nconclusion of the World Trade Organization Doha Round \r\nof multilateral trade negotiations. That would help to \r\nreduce further protectionist measures and contribute \r\nsignificantly to a more equitable and inclusive growth.\r\nIn conclusion, Malaysia wishes to underline the \r\nimportance of the United Nations having the central \r\nrole in promoting development and implementing the \r\ncommitments made on financing for development.\r\nMr. Escanero (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThis High-level Dialogue allows us to highlight this \r\nimportant political moment in which we are building \r\nthe collective agenda to advance towards equitable \r\nand sustainable development on a global scale. In \r\nparticular, it allows us to highlight the importance of \r\nuniting our efforts to follow up on Monterrey and to \r\nsupport intergovernmental efforts to establish a post-\r\n2015 development agenda. In that context, we welcome \r\nthe initiatives that have emerged during the General \r\nAssembly and through the Secretary-General and \r\nthe High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda, which have been aimed \r\nat holding a follow-up conference on the Monterrey \r\nprocess.\r\nThe spirit of Monterrey must guide our deliberations \r\nin order to ensure that the post-2015 agenda includes \r\nspecific actions and is results-oriented. Monterrey is \r\nbased on three pillars. First, the vision of a holistic \r\nagenda will allow us to incorporate efforts in all \r\nareas involving financing for development. Secondly, \r\na convergence of efforts must take place among all \r\nstakeholders. Thirdly, the United Nations has a key role \r\nto play as a platform for driving those efforts.\r\nOn this occasion, my delegation wishes to focus \r\non a few of the themes from the Monterrey Consensus, \r\nnamely international cooperation for development. \r\nMy country is fully convinced of the benefits of such \r\ncooperation. We stress the key responsibility that \r\neach country has to fulfil its role in development. We \r\nbelieve the international community has the means and \r\nthe responsibility to support those efforts. That is why \r\nwe reiterate the call for donor countries to fulfil their \r\nis concerned at the fact that official development \r\nassistance (ODA) to the developing countries has fallen \r\nfor two consecutive years. ODA remains critical for \r\ncountries with insufficient funds for development, in \r\nparticular the least developed countries (LDCs) and \r\ncountries that have recently graduated from the LDCs. \r\nThere are commitments that have been agreed to, but \r\nhave yet to be fulfilled. Such funds would be a great \r\nhelp for those countries in achieving their Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus stressed the importance \r\nof private international capital f lows, particularly \r\nforeign direct investment (FDI). Malaysia, as \r\nan advanced developing nation, relies on FDI to \r\nstrengthen its capital market, which in turn drives \r\nnational development efforts. Despite the growing \r\nneeds for investment to finance development, long-\r\nterm investment by international investors appears to \r\nbe declining. Globally, FDI decreased by around 18 per \r\ncent from 2011 to 2012. Net FDI f lows to developing \r\ncountries are estimated to have fallen by around 4 per \r\ncent, from $437 billion in 2011 to $419 billion in 2012. \r\nIn addition, a significant portion of FDI is invested \r\nin short-term investments, which could reverse more \r\nquickly than expected in an uncertain economic and \r\nfinancial climate.\r\nThe weakening of the major Asian currencies, \r\nincluding the Malaysian ringgit, against major-economy \r\ncurrencies in recent weeks is clear evidence of the \r\nrisks of short-term investment to national development \r\nefforts. The trend is mainly attributed to the widespread \r\ncapital withdrawal from emerging Asian economies \r\nback to developed nations.\r\nMalaysia remains concerned with the current global \r\neconomic situation surrounding the European Union \r\nand the United States, as well as the recent contagion \r\nrisk concerning emerging economies. Malaysia hopes \r\nthat the economic woes faced by developed countries \r\nwill not cause the world to enter into a new global \r\nrecession.\r\nMalaysia looks forward to further enhanced trade \r\nand investment relations between Malaysia and the \r\nMember States of the United Nations. Malaysia views \r\ninternational trade as an engine for development. \r\nHowever, the recovery in world trade following the \r\nfinancial crisis lost its momentum in 2012. World trade \r\ngrew by only 2.0 per cent, down from 5.2 per cent in \r\n2011. The deceleration is associated with weakening \r\ndemand, in particular in developed countries. Many \r\n13-50232 9/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nbridges and forges synergies with the Development \r\nCooperation Forum of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand other major United Nations bodies in developing a \r\njoint programme of action on equitable and sustainable \r\nglobal development.\r\nThe road map of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nhas been established. Member States have committed to \r\nwork towards a single agenda and a set of transformative \r\ngoals aimed at fighting poverty and fostering equitable \r\nand sustainable development.\r\nThe outcome document of the Special Event to follow \r\nup on efforts made towards achieving the MDGs and the \r\npost-2015 development agenda (resolution 68/6), which \r\nwas held last week, reflected a commitment to develop \r\na coherent agenda addressing poverty reduction, human \r\nrights, economic transformation, social justice and the \r\nresponsible management of the environment. To ensure \r\nthose efforts, the development agenda must focus on \r\nlessons learned in terms of the MDGs and international \r\nagreements on economic, social and environmental \r\nmatters, including, in particular, the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration.\r\nThe definition process that leads up to the 2015 \r\nsummit will be fuelled by related actions, including the \r\n2014 reports of the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing. As to the latter, there is broad consensus that \r\nits work must focus on the policy framework contained \r\nin the Monterrey Consensus. The Consensus and its \r\nsubstantive platform, as well as today’s dialogue and \r\nour decision to hold a follow-up meeting, must serve as \r\na guide not only in fulfilling our own commitment to \r\nthe process, but in following up the current discussions \r\non the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMs. Al-Hadid (Jordan): At the outset, I wish to \r\nthank the presidency for convening the sixth High-level \r\nDialogue on the important and relevant theme of “The \r\nMonterrey Consensus, Doha Declaration on Financing \r\nfor Development and related outcomes of major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits: status of \r\nimplementation and tasks ahead”. My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement delivered by the representative \r\nof Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/68/PV.29) and thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report entitled “Follow-up and implementation of \r\npledges for official development assistance (ODA), \r\nespecially to donate 0.7 per cent of the donors’ gross \r\nnational income to that end. At the same time, Mexico, \r\nas a provider of South-South cooperation, will redouble \r\nits efforts to support the development of equally or less \r\ndeveloped countries, working in association with other \r\ncountries through triangular cooperation.\r\nIn 2011, Mexico adopted a new law on international \r\ncooperation that established the Mexican Agency for \r\nInternational Development Cooperation. It is a clear \r\nindication of our desire to strengthen cooperation. \r\nMoreover, in that respect, Mexico is not alone.\r\nEfforts to strengthen international cooperation \r\naimed at the countries of the South must fully bear in \r\nmind that developing countries face major domestic \r\nchallenges, in particular the fight against poverty and \r\ninequality. That is why Mexico considers it essential \r\nto recall the key role of middle-income countries \r\nin ensuring effective cooperation. Those countries \r\nstill have specific needs of varying types in terms \r\nof international cooperation and cooperation with \r\nmultilateral agencies. For some, official development \r\nassistance f lows remain highly important.\r\nCooperation directed towards middle-income \r\ncountries can also have a significant multiplier \r\neffect. While such efforts can be of direct assistance \r\nin efforts to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), they can also lead to South-South \r\nand triangular cooperation involving lower-income \r\ncountries. In an indirect way, promoting development \r\nin middle-income countries in areas such as trade, \r\ninvestment and technology transfer, among others, can \r\nindirectly benefit the less developed countries. With \r\nrespect to ensuring a global impact on well-being, we \r\nmust consider our increasingly interconnected world \r\nand look for ways to move from simply providing \r\nassistance to promoting genuine development in various \r\ncountries.\r\nIn support of a truly inclusive international dialogue \r\non those issues and in order to significantly strengthen \r\nour efforts to ensure development, Mexico has assumed \r\nthe responsibility of hosting, from 15 to 16 April \r\n2014, the first ministerial conference of the Global \r\nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation. \r\nMexico considers it essential that the first high-level \r\nmeeting be inclusive and converge with the broad \r\ndemocratic platform provided by the United Nations. \r\nWe will attempt in particular to ensure that it builds \r\n10/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nspecify implementation methods, including financing \r\nfor development.\r\nThere is no doubt that trade remains the dynamic \r\nforce behind the growth of a global economy. It is \r\nimportant to address progressive advances made in \r\nstrengthening the international trading system with \r\ncorresponding steps taken from the multilateral \r\nfinancial and monetary architecture. We hope that \r\nnegotiations on a global trade deal under the World Trade \r\nOrganization Doha Round of talks will move forward \r\nat the forthcoming ninth Ministerial Conference, due to \r\nbe held in Bali in December 2013.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation hopes that the \r\ndiscussion here today will contribute to a call for \r\njoint international efforts in addressing the challenges \r\nfaced by all of us and that they will renew the focus \r\non implementing our common agenda as agreed in \r\nMonterrey, Doha and at other multilateral forums.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to associate myself with the \r\nstatement made by Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina (see A/68/PV.29). In addition to that statement, I \r\nalso wish to make a few points.\r\nEveryone generally agrees that the worst of the \r\nglobal economic crisis is behind us. Everything \r\nindicates that we are making a slow recovery. The \r\nglobal economy is being reactivated, even though \r\nthe pace is uneven, depending on the country, and \r\nsome challenges still remain that could slow down \r\nthe recovery. Therefore, we need to think about how \r\nto strengthen financing for development, which has \r\nsuffered as a result of fiscal policies that have been \r\nimplemented by many developed countries since 2011 \r\nand by a large number of developing countries since \r\n2013. That is significant.\r\nAccording to a report issued by the South Centre, \r\n33 developing countries will be reducing their tax \r\nbudgets for the period 2013-2015, bringing them to \r\na level that is lower than 2005-2007. The primacy of \r\npublic-sector policies for development requires that we \r\nfacilitate and improve access to financing for public \r\n-sector projects, especially when it comes to fighting \r\npoverty. That is a priority area in that the structural \r\naspects of development, which have led to the gap \r\nbetween developing and developed countries, are caused \r\nby poverty. Therefore, public policy must especially \r\ntake into account improving revenue, thereby creating \r\ndecent jobs, which is the key tool in fighting poverty.\r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development” (A/68/357).\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus sets out to achieve \r\ncoherence and consistency among the policies aimed \r\nat supporting developing countries in their efforts \r\nto realize the objectives set by various international \r\nconferences and summits, including the Millennium \r\nSummit. It is essential to recognize that, while notions \r\nof coherence and consistency may vary, they have \r\nsimilar impacts, as incoherent policies undermine \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt this time, the international community still faces \r\nincreasingly complex development challenges that have \r\nrevealed weaknesses in the international financial \r\nsystem related to sustainable financial stability and \r\nmobilizing financial resources for development. \r\nAs a consequence, new policies and international \r\nframeworks that accord with the basic principle of \r\ninclusive participation and support renewed global \r\npartnerships in support of development are required.\r\nWhile the quantity and effectiveness of official \r\ndevelopment assistance has improved over the past \r\ndecade, downside risks remain elevated amid the \r\ncurrent global economic uncertainty. However, despite \r\ndevelopments that continue to give rise to fiscal \r\nchallenges, the commitments made by the international \r\ncommunity in Monterrey and Doha to ensuring \r\npredictable development assistance and supporting \r\nnationally owned development strategies need to be \r\nre-emphasized.\r\nFurthermore, identifying innovative financing \r\nmechanisms to supplement traditional financing \r\nsources by generating additional, sustained and scaled-\r\nup aid delivery to developing countries and promoting \r\naid effectiveness remains a vital part of all efforts; \r\nit requires a concerted, coherent and coordinated \r\napproach by Governments, regional and multilateral \r\norganizations and relevant stakeholders. Improving \r\naccess to finance will help to foster inclusive growth, \r\naccelerate economic development and thus overcome \r\nexclusion and inequality.\r\nThe recent report of the High-level Panel of \r\nEminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development \r\nAgenda contains a positive reference to the importance \r\nof finance in the post-2015 development framework. \r\nThe framework must build on an analysis of the \r\nfinancing required to achieve the established goals. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda should clearly \r\n13-50232 11/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nSecretary-General and the representative of the Group \r\nof 77 and China, special drawing rights are, without \r\na doubt, instruments that help give financial systems \r\nmore consistency and coherence.\r\nAnother mechanism that has been proposed is the \r\nDaly-Correa Tax, which is a tax on oil exports and is \r\nconsidered to be an environmental levy on the cost of a \r\nbarrel of oil, which could also be applied to other fuels \r\nthat are exported, depending on their impact on the \r\nenvironment.\r\nWe should bear in mind and support the conclusions \r\nof the Commission for the Restructuring of the \r\nFinancial System, chaired by Professor Stiglitz in 2008. \r\nMost here probably remember that report. Today more \r\nthan ever before, we need to transform the situation and \r\npush for the much-needed reforms that that creditable \r\nCommission suggested. I am referring to favouring \r\nregional monetary and financial agreements and to \r\nsupporting mechanisms that have been negotiated to \r\ndeal with sovereign debt. That report also calls on us to \r\nreflect on the crisis that the dollar and other so-called \r\ninternationally active currencies are undergoing. We \r\nall hold those currencies, although they are issued at \r\nthe discretion of a handful of countries. We believe that \r\nthose ideas are innovative, but they require political \r\ncommitment, especially from countries in the North. \r\nThat is where we have a major shortcoming at the \r\nmoment.\r\nIn addition, as part of freeing up and directing \r\nresources towards development and productive \r\ninvestment throughout the world, we believe and \r\nrecognize the urgent need, as set out by the International \r\nCentre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, to bolster \r\nsuch settlement processes at the regional level. Within \r\nthat framework, it is important that the continental \r\nprocessing of foreign direct investment occur under \r\nconditions in which States are not subject to the greedy \r\ninterests of transnational corporations.\r\nAt the same time, it is essential to make progress \r\ntowards reforms of the United Nations Commission \r\non International Trade Law that would allow a shift in \r\ndirection of financial terms so as to increase the sources \r\nof financing for sustainable development. We ought to \r\nrecognize that there is a profound asymmetry. The rules \r\nfavour investors, and clearly within that framework, \r\nbusinesses have sought intensively to maximize their \r\nprofits at all costs, with the result that they have abused \r\nthe f lexibility provided under the current regulations.\r\nFrom that perspective, infrastructure projects \r\nare different in that they create many jobs while \r\nthey are being implemented, as well as short- and \r\nlong-term development opportunities. Such projects \r\nincrease access to energy, improve transportation and \r\ncommunication, and optimize productive activities. \r\nFinancing such projects is central to development and \r\nrequires optimizing the use of resources.\r\nIn order to optimize the financing of public \r\ndevelopment policies, my delegation believes that \r\nwe must fulfil the commitments made with regard \r\nto official development assistance as set out under \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Secondly, we \r\nmust step up the capitalization of national, regional \r\nand multilateral development banks and optimize \r\nthe financing they offer. Thirdly, we must mobilize \r\ndomestic resources, optimizing tax collections and \r\nreducing tax evasion. Fourthly, we must ensure the \r\ncreation of a mechanism that deals with sovereign debt \r\nin an orderly manner. Those debts in certain crises have \r\nhad a direct impact on the capacity of the public sector \r\nto finance development. In that regard, it is essential to \r\nneutralize vulture funds, which take advantage of the \r\nfact that there is no debt-resolution mechanism.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to point out that financing \r\nof the private sector should be complementary to \r\nofficial financing and that it should not determine \r\npublic development policies.\r\nMr. Trujillo (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I would like to endorse the statement made by \r\nFiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/68/\r\nPV.29), stressing that we should make progress on \r\ncommitments made in the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration of 2008. As other delegations \r\nhave mentioned, those are basic agreements, but \r\nwe must go beyond them. In that connection, I have \r\nspecific proposals from Ecuador, which will, in the \r\nframework of the new global financial architecture \r\nand on a regional basis, contribute decisively, we hope, \r\ntowards multilateral agreements.\r\nIn the context of the new global financial \r\narchitecture, we propose creating innovative financing \r\nmechanisms for development. There are the special \r\ndrawing rights of the International Monetary Fund, \r\nfor example, which are a politically and economically \r\nviable option and an additional way to ensure financial \r\nlongevity for some sustainable development initiatives \r\nthat are being discussed here today. As stated by the \r\n12/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\ncountries in the region access to drugs at affordable \r\ncosts as well as at ensuring the local production of those \r\ndrugs, in particular drugs that combat diseases endemic \r\nto the region, that have been deemed non-profitable by \r\nthe large transnational pharmaceutical corporations of \r\nthe developed world.\r\nSovereignty over food and natural resources is \r\nessential for nations. That ownership, however, has \r\ntypically been limited by speculation in foods by private \r\ntransnational companies. In dealing with that situation, \r\nthere is a clear need to generate a completely new type \r\nof development bank. We need to have new monetary \r\nagreements that are pro-development, if we are to realize \r\nsome of the initiatives that perhaps some countries may \r\nbe familiar with, such as a regional payments system \r\nthat is pro-development and favours trade f lows and \r\nproduction. There are other components, such as the \r\nSouth Fund, which seeks to transform regional central \r\nbanks.\r\nWe have heard today about the need to deal with the \r\ncosts of migrants to developed countries. In developing \r\ncountries we are proposing a bank that deals seriously \r\nwith development goals, while not moving away \r\nfrom our main goal, which is to deal with stability, \r\nemployment and inflation.\r\nThe common reserve fund of the South is directed \r\nat promoting the financial stability and exchange \r\nstability of member States by designing instruments \r\nto maintain international reserves at appropriate \r\nlevels to deal with the impact of crises. The common \r\nmanagement of the reserves of our countries would \r\nallow a turnaround in the sacrifices that the countries \r\nof Latin America have made to build reserves and \r\nmaintain them in the international financial markets in \r\nthe North, which causes developing countries to lose \r\nthe opportunity to invest in infrastructure. Funds have \r\nto be freed up so that we can invest in the real economy, \r\nin railroads, universities, hospitals, ports and the many \r\nother projects that are needed in our countries. It is very \r\ndifficult to make progress towards a new international \r\nfinancial architecture if countries do not also decide to \r\nwork on a new domestic financial architecture.\r\nFinally, there is a role to be played by trade in \r\ndevelopment, a concept that we agree on, but for that \r\nthe developed countries need to ensure favourable \r\nconditions for less developed countries. We must take \r\ninto account the fact that trade dependency and the \r\nintra-firm trade with the North is enormous, and with a \r\nchange in the productive system we will gain enormous \r\nAn example of the wide range for interpreting the \r\ninvestment regulations of the International Centre for \r\nSettlement of Investment Disputes in a biased way can \r\nbe seen in my country in the Texaco-Chevron case, after \r\nthe firm caused the greatest environmental disaster in \r\nour history with a spill of more than 68 million cubic \r\nmetres of toxic waste into the Ecuadorian Amazon. \r\nWe have launched a campaign to address that injustice \r\nagainst Ecuador. Many of our countries face lawsuits \r\nfrom such corporations. Investments that lead to \r\nsuch serious damage do not contribute in the least to \r\ndevelopment, and we should not accept or, what is \r\nworse, promote them.\r\nIt is very important that we work in the context \r\nof this discussion on a campaign that inspires and \r\nstrengthens regional agreements in order to build a \r\nworld that is more balanced and fair and with fewer \r\nof the asymmetries that affect us all. We also need to \r\nrespond to the protest and call to redesign the regulations \r\nat a global level, block by block, in a new round of \r\nrenegotiations on all North-South relationships. We \r\ncall for a new regional financial architecture as an \r\ninstrument that would deepen integration in the areas \r\nof supranational financial sovereignty and for reforms \r\nto the monetary and financial system in line with the \r\nvision coming from the South. As we have said, we \r\nshould promote reforms that suit the identities of the \r\ncountries of the South.\r\nThe coordination of agreements among relatively \r\nf lexible blocs is the best means of achieving positive \r\nresults. The success of such initiatives will lay the \r\ngroundwork for a political juncture where other \r\ninstitutional agreements can promote a holistic and \r\nstable new financial architecture. We must make \r\nserious progress on those issues.\r\nIn South America, for example, we are working \r\non a new regional financial architecture comprising \r\nthree basic pillars: a new type of development bank, a \r\nnew regional unit of account and a Southern common \r\nreserve fund. We can demonstrate that they are \r\nsustainable monetary and financial initiatives, needed \r\nin order to respond to the consequences of the deep \r\nuncertainty and dependency generated by the financial \r\nand monetary system that has been, unfortunately, \r\nlargely driven by private interests and big capital.\r\nSimilarly, considering the fundamental role of \r\nhealth in the development of peoples, the action of \r\nthe new type of development bank in the Ecuadorian \r\nproposal should be aimed at ensuring the people of the \r\n13-50232 13/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nterm horizons and its risk aversion, particularly with \r\nregard to infrastructure, innovation and small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprise financing — areas that are \r\nvital for enhancing economic growth and the pace of \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFourthly, we are pleased that the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development has \r\nstarted its work. We are also supportive of the climate \r\nfinancing track. We hope that those deliberations will \r\nlead to an integrated and coherent financing framework, \r\nincluding for the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe Government of Pakistan is committed to \r\nbringing prosperity to the people of Pakistan. We are \r\ncorrecting structural imbalances, encouraging domestic \r\nresource mobilization, improving revenue collection \r\nand strengthening partnerships with the private sector. \r\nIf we are sincere and focused in our discourse today, I \r\nwould ask the world to join with us as we seek enhanced \r\ntrade for Pakistan, including investment and strong \r\neconomic partnerships.\r\nLastly, we urge the United Nations, given its \r\nunquestioned legitimacy and representative character, \r\nto continue to lead efforts to foster a spirit of genuine \r\npartnership.\r\nMs. Beck (Solomon Islands): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Fiji, Benin and Belize, who spoke on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs), and the small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS), respectively (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nMy delegation welcomes this High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development. Like others who have \r\nspoken before me, I would like to say that this high-level \r\nmeeting is timely as we take stock of the implementation \r\nof the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration \r\non Financing for Development. The impact of the global \r\nfinancial crisis and climate change is undermining \r\nour global time-bound social and development goals, \r\nincluding the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nAs we look at financing for development, the post-\r\n2015 development agenda offers us an opportunity \r\nto change the way we do business. In that regard, \r\nSolomon Islands seeks a new spirit of partnership \r\nthat will reform the global economic architecture. We \r\nnote that this year, under the leadership of the United \r\nNations Development Programme, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Assistance Framework for the Pacific for \r\nthe period 2013-2017 was launched. It covers 14 Pacific \r\nbenefits through the establishment of supranational \r\nspaces for food sovereignty, energy, health and \r\nknowledge. The post-2015 agenda encourages us to \r\nensure that those themes will be addressed in order to \r\nhave sustainable financing in the years to come.\r\nMr. Sahebzada Ahmed Khan (Pakistan): We thank \r\nthe President for convening the High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development. Pakistan aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the representative of Fiji on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.29). \r\nWe would, however, like to make some additional \r\npoints in our national capacity.\r\nPakistan considers this deliberation on the status \r\nof implementation and the tasks ahead with regard to \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development timely. It is also critical to \r\nlink the ongoing discussions on a post-2015 development \r\nagenda with financing needs.\r\nWe have witnessed some progress on the goals set \r\nat Monterrey and reaffirmed at Doha. The objectives \r\nof sustained economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are, however, yet to be achieved. Our \r\nwork on establishing a fully inclusive and equitable \r\nglobal economic system can, at best, be termed as a \r\nwork in progress.\r\nUnfortunately, official development assistance \r\n(ODA) remains short of commitments, and a number \r\nof developing countries have yet to grow out of their \r\ndebt. The benefits of international trade and capital \r\nf lows are still to be experienced by all developing \r\ncountries, especially, the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs). Access to development financing has become \r\na serious challenge for developing countries in today’s \r\ngrim world economic situation.\r\nWe would like to contribute four points to today’s \r\ndiscourse.\r\nFirst, inclusive economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment cannot be achieved without sound \r\ndomestic socioeconomic policies, domestic resource \r\nmobilization and good governance.\r\nSecondly, a global economy that provides equitable \r\nopportunities to all countries, large or small, least \r\ndeveloped or emerging, small islands or landlocked, is \r\nan imperative for creating a better future for the people \r\nof the world.\r\nThirdly, it is crucial to design policies that enable \r\nthe private sector to overcome its penchant for short-\r\n14/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nfinancial and economic crises, especially with respect \r\nto vulnerable countries.\r\nTrade remains the engine of growth and is a key \r\ncomponent in poverty eradication and employment \r\ncreation. Unfortunately, the LDCs’ share of global \r\ntrade remains around 1 per cent since the adoption of \r\nthe Monterrey Consensus. We are deeply concerned \r\nover the lack of will to conclude the Doha Round, as \r\nLDCs continue to be deprived of the provisions of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization’s Hong Kong Ministerial \r\nDeclaration, Annex F, providing for duty-free and \r\nquota-free market access for LDC products and \r\nservices. We hope that the Bali Ministerial Conference \r\non the Doha Round on trade in December will have a \r\nfavourable outcome.\r\nEnhancing the productive capacities critical for \r\nnation-building in post-conflict countries, especially \r\nthe development component for sustaining peace \r\nand development investment, must remain central to \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding initiatives in order \r\nto ensure better aid coordination in post-conflict and \r\nconflict-affected countries.\r\nMy delegation would like to put forward some \r\nsuggestions as we look at financing for development \r\nbeyond 2015.\r\nFirst, dedicated financial resources and technology \r\ntransfer to address supply-side constraints, mainly \r\naffecting developing countries, especially LDCs and \r\nSIDS, should be put in place. Secondly, trade in goods \r\nand services should be facilitated so as to include the \r\nmovement of natural persons for migrant work, and \r\nthe cost of remittance transactions should be reduced. \r\nThirdly, aid for trade should be operationalized so as to \r\ndirectly support national development efforts to ensure \r\nthe sustainability of trade in the productive sectors and \r\naccelerate achievement of the MDGs, especially for \r\nLDCs and SIDS. Fourthly, all trade-distorting measures \r\nshould be eliminated. Fifthly, the debt of LDCs should \r\nbe cancelled or converted into sustainable development \r\nprogrammes.\r\nIn closing, the outcome of today’s meeting \r\nmust enhance financing for development, identify \r\nfinancing gaps within existing sustainable development \r\nframeworks, and recognize the special situation of \r\nLDCs and SIDS as we move forward in considering the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nMs. Rambally (Saint Lucia): Saint Lucia is grateful \r\nfor the opportunity to add its voice to this important \r\ncountries and territories. We note, in that regard, that \r\nthe principle of one size fits all cannot be applied. We \r\ncall for respect and for recognition of the special and \r\nunique circumstances of countries in the region. We \r\nask that financing be aligned with national sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategies. Country ownership must \r\nremain a foundation for any cooperation or programme.\r\nNext year, the United Nations will hold the \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates to eradicate poverty and build resilience. The \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) are calling for \r\ngenuine and durable partnerships to address the unique \r\nsustainable development challenges faced by them. That \r\nmeans an enhanced implementation of the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy.\r\nThe means of implementation must remain the \r\ncornerstone of the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts for many living in extreme \r\npoverty. The fact is that many LDCs will not meet the \r\nMDGs by 2015. The 2011-2020 Istanbul Programme of \r\nAction for the LDCs looks beyond 2015 and is a North-\r\nSouth, South-South and triangular partnership with \r\nthe aim of graduating 50 per cent of LDCs from that \r\nstatus within a 10-year period. That is an ambitious \r\nand achievable goal, if all international support pledges \r\nare honoured and invested in productive sectors of the \r\nLDCs’ economies.\r\nWe need to ensure that official development \r\nassistance remains predictable and sufficient, in order \r\nto allow for LDC and SIDS economies, in particular, \r\nto make the necessary transformation and trigger \r\neconomic take-off. It also means their integration into \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nWith regard to financing for climate change, \r\nfunds pledged must be managed and distributed in \r\na transparent and accountable manner. We remain \r\nconcerned that the current climate-change financial \r\nmechanisms remain empty shells with no funds to make \r\nthem operational. We know that the distribution of aid \r\nfor trade is skewed to a few countries, which was evident \r\nin the Programme for Scaling-Up Renewable Energy in \r\nLow-Income Countries managed by the World Bank. \r\nThe voice and participation of LDCs and SIDS must \r\nbe recognized and represented, including clarity in the \r\nallocation of funds with a special window for LDCs. \r\nThat means that reform of the international financial \r\nand economic system is critical to ensuring that the \r\nsystem is inclusive, representative and accountable to \r\nall Member States when dealing with the impact of \r\n13-50232 15/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nThis Dialogue provides a meaningful opportunity \r\nfor all actors in the global partnership for development \r\nto engage with the goal of summoning the political \r\nwill needed to accelerate and strengthen commitments \r\nmade. True development cooperation ensures that \r\ncommitments made will be commitments kept.\r\nMr. Yamazaki (Japan): This High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development is very timely, since \r\nthrough our two-day discussion the follow-up process \r\nto the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration \r\non Financing for Development can be properly fed into \r\ndeliberations on the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nparticularly the discussion on what will succeed \r\nMillennium Development Goal (MDG) number 8.\r\nThe comprehensive character of the report \r\nof the International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, Monterrey, Mexico, and the Doha \r\nDeclaration on Financing for Development: outcome \r\ndocument, which in their six or seven chapters discuss \r\nvarious modalities of development finance, beginning \r\nwith domestic resources, makes them, in our view, a \r\nvery good basis for a future post-MDG 8, and another \r\nreason why today’s Dialogue is important. Of course, \r\nwe will have to go further than Monterrey and Doha.\r\nReflecting on the changing landscape around \r\ndevelopment cooperation in today’s world, my delegation \r\nwould like to emphasize the importance not only of \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) commitments but \r\nalso of various other financial resources. Development \r\nfinance in the future will have to involve all the various \r\nactors in development cooperation, including emerging \r\neconomies, the private sector and civil society. Their \r\nfinances and human resources should be maximized in \r\nterms of both quantity and quality.\r\nFinancing for development has long been an \r\nessential tool for attaining one of the fundamental \r\ngoals of the United Nations, namely, promoting social \r\nprogress and better standards of living in larger freedom. \r\nWhile donor countries should therefore remain firmly \r\ndedicated to meeting their commitments on providing \r\nODA and other assistance, more coordinated action \r\non the part of all development actors is essential. \r\nFurthermore, innovative mechanisms for financing for \r\ndevelopment deserve more attention.\r\nAt the same time, we must keep in mind that \r\nfinancing is not an end in itself but rather a means for \r\nachieving development. We must therefore be results-\r\noriented, paying more attention to delivering resources \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development. \r\nWe align ourselves with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Fiji, on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and of Saint Kitts and Nevis, on behalf of the \r\nCaribbean Community (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nWe have arrived at this sixth Dialogue through \r\na whirl of financial and economic crises that have \r\nleft both developed and developing countries beset \r\nby a range of social and economic challenges and \r\nhave placed small and vulnerable developing States \r\nin a precarious position. We also find ourselves at \r\nan extremely critical juncture as we work actively to \r\nset the stage for the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThe background against which we have convened \r\nmust serve as the foundation for our examination of \r\nthe development cooperation landscape, and a lens \r\nthrough which we highlight the challenges that must be \r\naddressed if developing countries are to move in earnest \r\ntowards the achievement of the internationally agreed-\r\non development goals, particularly the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIn that context, Saint Lucia wishes to reiterate \r\nCaribbean Community’s call for the international \r\ncommunity, the United Nations development system and \r\nthe international financial institutions to take a more \r\nsystematic approach to dealing with the development \r\nneeds of developing countries characterized as \r\nmiddle-income countries, with the goal of providing \r\nthem with increased access to concessionary financing. \r\nSuch an approach would serve to mitigate further \r\nerosion of the development gains we have made to date, \r\nby alleviating the unstable economic situation in which \r\nsmall, vulnerable, highly indebted middle-income \r\nStates, like Saint Lucia, have found themselves.\r\nSaint Lucia recognizes that, in our efforts to \r\nmobilize international resources for development, it \r\nis vital that we adopt new and innovative approaches \r\nand work closely with our partners to that end. In \r\nthat light, we have committed to the financing-for-\r\ndevelopment process, with direct participation in \r\nthe Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus and its reaffirmation in \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development \r\nhave provided a framework for international \r\ndevelopment cooperation. Over the next few days, as \r\nwe discuss the status of their implementation and the \r\ntask ahead, one thing is clear, namely, that the way \r\nforward lies in the political will to cooperate.\r\n16/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nprocesses, including the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, \r\nthe financing for development process and the Global \r\nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation, \r\nshould take a coherent approach to agreeing on a new \r\nglobal partnership to be included in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and one that involves a variety of \r\ndevelopment actors.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my hope \r\nonce again that the discussions at this High-level \r\nDialogue will provide valuable inputs and insights into \r\nthe deliberations in various forums on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nMr. Ndour (Senegal) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to express my pleasure and that of \r\nthe Senegalese delegation at sharing with the General \r\nAssembly our country’s views and considerations \r\nwith respect to the important issue of financing for \r\ndevelopment — a theme that is of great significance for \r\nus and for all developing countries. Naturally, our views \r\nand considerations are consistent with and support \r\nthose set forth by the representatives of Fiji, Ethiopia \r\nand Benin, who spoke on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, the African Group and the least developed \r\ncountries (LDCs), respectively (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nThe conclusions of the report entitled “Global \r\nEconomic Outlook 2013” amply show that the overall \r\ngrowth of the global economy following the marked \r\nslowdown in 2012 is expected to remain weak over the \r\nnext two years. That less than encouraging situation \r\nleads us to admit the apparent inability of the global \r\neconomy to transcend today’s great challenges for \r\nour countries, in particular, inadequate resources, the \r\nunemployment crisis, inflationary pressures, external \r\ndebt, instability in the financial markets, and many \r\nother scourges. Those elements, indicative of the \r\ngrowing dysfunction in economic mechanisms, reflect \r\nthe depth and extent of the constraints on our States as \r\nthey seek to adequately ensure the financing of national \r\ndevelopment policies and respect for commitments \r\nmade in that area.\r\nWith the emergence of those dangerous challenges, \r\nthis meeting to assess the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the Monterrey Consensus of 2002 \r\nand the Doha Declaration of 2008 offers us a unique \r\nopportunity to examine new development strategies. \r\nSuch strategies are becoming increasingly necessary, \r\nespecially if we want to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and promote inclusive, sustainable \r\neffectively in order to meet real development needs. \r\nIn that regard, it is important that all development \r\npartners participate in the Global Partnership for \r\nEffective Development Cooperation, whose first high-\r\nlevel meeting, to be held in Mexico in April, will follow \r\nup on what was agreed on at the High-Level Forum on \r\nAid Effectiveness held in Busan in 2011. Collaboration \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Global Partnership, \r\nthrough the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment, is essential in that regard.\r\nThe special event following up on efforts to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals, held \r\ntwo weeks ago, was a great opportunity to renew \r\nour political commitment to achieving the MDGs, \r\nand to develop guidelines for the concrete actions of \r\nvarious stakeholders. During the general debate in \r\nthe Assembly two weeks ago, Mr. Shinzo Abe, the \r\nPrime Minister of Japan, stated that Japan has set \r\naside $500 million to address health issues in Africa, \r\nand has set up training programmes for some 120,000 \r\nhealth and medical service providers (see A/68/PV.12). \r\nPrime Minister Abe also mentioned that Japan intends \r\nto make an appropriate contribution at the upcoming \r\nFourth Replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which seeks to secure \r\nadditional financing for the Fund at the global level.\r\nIn June, Japan hosted the fifth Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development, where African \r\nheads of State and Government repeatedly expressed \r\ngreat eagerness to welcome private-sector investment, \r\nref lecting the fact that the f low of investment to Africa \r\nnow exceeds that of assistance. We believe, therefore, \r\nthat Japan’s assistance to Africa should be utilized \r\nstrategically by focusing on fostering human resources \r\nas a catalyst that invites further investment. Such \r\ncooperation between Africa and Japan will promote \r\nsustainable growth while cultivating ownership by \r\nAfrican countries themselves.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that the \r\noutcome document of the Special Event on the \r\nMDGs (resolution 68/3) lays out a clear work plan for \r\norganically integrating various processes related to \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, such as the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwith a view to working towards a single framework and \r\nset of goals. In that regard, the issue of development \r\nfinancing should also be appropriately integrated in line \r\nwith the appropriate work plan. Therefore, the various \r\n13-50232 17/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nadditional resources that are stable and predictable. \r\nThere have been many concrete initiatives in that \r\narea, including the tax on airline tickets. Accordingly, \r\nmy delegation would like to invite the international \r\ncommunity to continue discussions on the subject \r\nand to call for an adequate redistribution of resources \r\ndrawn from those new mechanisms for the benefit of \r\ntarget countries based on their development priorities.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to conclude by \r\nemphasizing that the new sources of financing are, in \r\nfact, additional sources and are not, therefore, designed \r\nto supplant traditional financing mechanisms or \r\naffect the significance and volume of such traditional \r\nfinancial mechanisms.\r\nMr. Pehlivan (Turkey): At the outset, let me \r\nexpress our pleasure at the convening of this critical \r\nHigh-level Dialogue and congratulate all the relevant \r\nparties for their kind efforts to that end. My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement made by the observer \r\nof the European Union (see A/68/PV.29). Meanwhile, \r\nI take this opportunity to make a few remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nFinancing for development remains a global \r\nchallenge. Shortfalls in financing require rapid \r\nmobilization and the effective use of all resources so as \r\nto achieve sustained growth and eradicate poverty. The \r\nMonterrey Consensus and the Doha Declaration provide \r\nthe necessary framework for global development \r\npartnerships with fairer and more open trade and \r\nincreased financial aid to developing countries. \r\nAs we approach the 2015 deadline, it is crucial to \r\nallocate additional resources for the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Furthermore, \r\nthe means of implementation will be vital for future \r\nsustainable development goals and needs to be one of \r\nthe main components of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nThe global economic and financial crisis and the \r\nausterity measures in some countries are negatively \r\naffecting global development endeavours. Their impact \r\non developing countries has led to dramatic social and \r\neconomic consequences. Deep contractions in work \r\nand the demand for foods and services, along with the \r\nconsequent decrease in export earnings, foreign direct \r\ninvestment, private capital f lows and remittances, have \r\nled to additional challenges in the developing countries. \r\nAs a matter of fact, the global crisis has turned into a \r\ngrowth and job crisis in both developed and developing \r\ncountries.\r\nand equitable growth, with the aim of achieving our \r\ntop priority — eradicating poverty and bringing about \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Monterrey Consensus was an important \r\nmilestone in terms of strategies to implement and \r\npromote economic and social development. In \r\nreaffirming the commitment of Senegal to that \r\ninstrument, my delegation must, however, note that its \r\nadoption has not completely enabled our countries to \r\nredress the imbalances and revitalize our economies \r\nto the extent it should. Indeed, in terms of results, we \r\nmust underscore the weak mobilization of domestic \r\nresources and foreign capital f lows and the declines \r\nin income from export, in the volume of migrant \r\nremittances and in foreign direct investment f lows. \r\nThat worrisome situation is acutely illustrated in most \r\nof our States, inter alia, by a substantial decrease in the \r\nrate of economic growth and by rising unemployment.\r\nFor all of the foregoing and other relevant reasons, \r\nmy delegation believes that the international community \r\nshould play a more instrumental role in the fulfilment \r\nof international commitments, particularly with respect \r\nto official development assistance (ODA), as set forth \r\nin the Istanbul Programme of Action for the LDCs \r\nfor the Decade 2011-2020 and the Busan Partnership \r\nagreement.\r\nWith respect to ODA, my delegation believes that we \r\nshould adopt measures to ensure greater predictability \r\nof aid f lows in order to ensure their effectiveness by \r\nfocusing on national priorities and local development \r\npolicies. In addition, we must work to overcome the \r\nburden of external debt and ensure renewed economic \r\ngovernance and a more equitable trading system \r\nthrough the elimination of protectionist measures, a \r\nsuitable conclusion to the Doha Round of negotiations \r\nand the realization of aid-for-trade.\r\nSimilarly, we should insist together on climate \r\nfinancing and the implementation of agreements on \r\nclimate change, including the Green Climate Fund and \r\nthe transfer of environmentally sound technologies. My \r\ndelegation would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the establishment of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing and urge the international community to \r\nwork to ensure its effective functioning.\r\nThe lack of resources coming from traditional \r\nsources for development finance has, fortunately, led \r\nto the emergence of innovative mechanisms to generate \r\n18/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nColombia recognizes the importance of this sixth \r\nHigh-level Dialogue at a time when it is necessary \r\nto redouble and accelerate our efforts to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and to set in \r\nmotion a post-2015 development agenda focused on \r\nthe eradication of poverty within a framework of \r\nsustainability and a shift in the patterns of production \r\nand consumption that will guarantee that the results \r\nachieved are truly irreversible.\r\nWhile it is true that important progress has been \r\nmade since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus \r\nand the Doha Declaration, we need to strengthen \r\nthe follow-up and implementation process for the \r\ncommitments undertaken in their regard, which would \r\nhelp to enhance the coherence and cohesion of the \r\nfinancial and commercial systems, thereby ensuring \r\nthat they effectively support the implementation of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals.\r\nIn that regard, we believe that it is essential for \r\nthere to be a reliable monitoring mechanism within the \r\nUnited Nations system that could be conceived of as a \r\nsubsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand that would allow us to close the gap between policy \r\nformulation and the implementation of commitments. It \r\nis imperative to reverse the real-term decline in official \r\ndevelopment assistance f lows for development and trade \r\nthat has been seen in the past two years and to fulfil \r\nall the commitments made in those spheres. Deeper \r\ninternational technical cooperation is also needed, with \r\nspecial emphasis on closing the current digital gap \r\nbetween developed and developing countries in order \r\nto strengthen developing countries’ ability to attain the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nLikewise, more measures are required to ensure \r\ntimely relief for severely indebted developing countries. \r\nThe existing structure for restructuring sovereign debt \r\nis far from ideal. While the inclusion of collective \r\naction clauses in bond contracts and the development \r\nof a voluntary code of conduct to guide negotiations \r\non restructuring sovereign debt constitute an important \r\nadvance, there needs to be a more appropriate, effective \r\nand equitable framework for restructuring sovereign \r\ndebt.\r\nIn order for business to play its role as an engine \r\nfor development, developing countries require better \r\nand broader access to international markets. It is, \r\ntherefore, critical to make progress in the Doha Round \r\nnegotiations at the upcoming ministerial meeting of the \r\nTo craft an adequate response to the crisis, concerted \r\ninternational efforts must be directed at addressing the \r\nweakness of the global financial system and ensuring \r\nthat Governments implement adequate policies to \r\nrestore inclusive and sustainable growth. Efforts to \r\nreform the international financial architecture should \r\nbe continued with greater transparency and genuine and \r\neffective participation by the developing countries. The \r\nlong-term lending capabilities of international financial \r\ninstitutions and regional development banks should be \r\nenhanced through active market-funding corporations \r\nand, if necessary, through appropriate capital-injection \r\noperations. T he timely delivery of official development \r\nassistance and other aid commitments is essential.\r\nHowever, efforts relating to financing for \r\ndevelopment must go beyond bilateral aid. Increasing \r\ntrade, investments, debt relief and technology transfers \r\nis critical in that regard. Financing needs should be \r\nstructured in accordance with the nature of sectors, \r\nregions and the level of development of the countries \r\ninvolved. Investment in infrastructure, new and \r\nadditional financial resources for small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises, microfinance and human mobility \r\nshould be augmented so as to boost economic growth \r\nand job creation.\r\nAs a member of the Group of 20 and an emerging \r\ndonor country, Turkey will remain a strong supporter of \r\nthe development endeavours of the developing countries, \r\nin particular the least developed countries and small \r\nisland States. The scale of Turkey’s financial, technical \r\nand material assistance to developing countries, \r\nincluding that provided by Turkish non-governmental \r\norganizations, exceeded $2 billion in 2012 and will \r\ncertainly increase over the years to come.\r\nTo conclude, Turkey will assume the chairmanship \r\nof the Group of 20 in 2015. Financing for development \r\nand the means for implementing internationally agreed \r\ndevelopment goals will be among the priorities of our \r\nchairmanship.\r\nMr. Ruiz (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Assembly for convening this timely \r\nsixth High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development \r\nin order to review the implementation status of the \r\ncommitments undertaken in Monterrey and Doha as \r\nwell as other pending matters. My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nFiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/68/\r\nPV.29) and wishes to make the following remarks in its \r\nnational capacity.\r\n13-50232 19/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nto thank the President for organizing this sixth High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Financing for Development.\r\nThe key to countries’ development depends on the \r\navailability of finance, and it is through the mobilization \r\nof finance that developing countries achieve \r\ndevelopment. The Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration provide a useful framework in that regard. \r\nThey reaffirm the collective commitment to addressing \r\nthe challenges of financing for development in a spirit \r\nof global partnership and solidarity, which should be \r\nthe centrepiece of cooperation for development.\r\nThis Dialogue on Financing for Development \r\ncomes at a time when we are moving towards the 2015 \r\ntarget date for meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) and a development agenda beyond 2015. \r\nDeveloping countries’ ability to achieve the MDGs has \r\nsometimes been constrained by, among other things, \r\nthe volatility of financial f lows and commodity prices \r\nand external debt, issues that may also be compounded \r\nby the ongoing financial and economic crisis and by \r\nfood and energy crises, along with the challenges posed \r\nby climate change.\r\nIn that context, therefore, it is important to \r\naddress the systemic fragilities and imbalances in an \r\ninternational financial and monetary system in need \r\nof reform, including improved access to finance and \r\nfinancial services for all; increased representation for \r\ndeveloping countries on the international financial \r\nregulatory bodies; responsible lending and borrowing \r\npractices; debt management; and the debt-restructuring \r\nframework. My delegation believes that the international \r\ncommunity must pursue the development of an agreed \r\nmechanism for working out debt.\r\nMy delegation maintains that further efforts are \r\nneeded to ensure that past development commitments \r\nare not only honoured but are delivered in a form that \r\nis not disguised or recycled in any way. The African \r\ncontinent, in particular, faces severe challenges in \r\nimplementing the MDGs. The commitments that were \r\nmade at Gleneagles to increase assistance to Africa \r\nshould be honoured in order to help the continent to \r\nextricate itself from the challenges of poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment.\r\nWe also believe it is very important that the \r\ninclusive process for following up on financing for \r\ndevelopment be strengthened and its intergovernmental \r\ncharacter reinforced. My delegation supports the \r\ndecision to hold informal consultations to consider the \r\nWorld Trade Organization in Bali. Specifically, there \r\nneed to be agreements on establishing a mechanism for \r\nmonitoring the application of the principle of special \r\nand differential treatment for developing countries, as \r\nwell as a separate package for less advanced countries.\r\nIt has been recognized that the success of developing \r\ncountries does not depend exclusively on solid domestic \r\npolicies but also on a favourable external environment \r\nthat guarantees the coherence and cohesion of the \r\ninternational monetary, financial and commercial \r\nmarkets that support development. We must strengthen \r\nmultilateral, regional and subregional bank financing \r\nfor development and increase the capacity of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and development banks \r\nto provide sufficient resources for stabilizing markets \r\nin times of systemic liquidity crisis. In general, we \r\nneed a more responsible, inclusive and coherent global \r\neconomic system of governance, and that involves \r\nestablishing more effective machinery for collective \r\ndecision-making by the various interested parties at the \r\ninternational level in which the developing countries \r\nwill have increased participation.\r\nMs. Borges (Timor-Leste), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIn the context of the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nit is essential that we launch a solid, strengthened \r\nglobal alliance for development based on Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 8. Mobilizing financial resources \r\nfor development and channelling them all effectively \r\nare fundamental to launching such an alliance. In \r\nthat regard, an effective financing strategy requires \r\nthat we mobilize internal resources, fulfil all official \r\ndevelopment assistance commitments and use \r\ninnovative financing mechanisms. Given that official \r\nefforts will not be enough to met the enormous needs \r\ninvolved, we must devise strategies that enable us to \r\nattract private financing through risk-sharing measures \r\nand provide ways of enabling private initiatives to be \r\nbetter aligned with public goals, so as to facilitate long-\r\nterm investment in sectors that are crucial to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Such sectors include infrastructure, low-\r\ncarbon-emission projects and related innovations and \r\ntechnology, and financing for small and medium-sized \r\nbusinesses.\r\nMr. Nkombela (South Africa): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to align myself with the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of Fiji, on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and Ethiopia, on behalf of the African \r\nGroup (see A/68/PV.29). My delegation would also like \r\n20/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\neighth session, Ambassador John Ashe, to appoint \r\nco-facilitators before the end of 2013 and to hold open, \r\ninclusive and direct intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nwith the participation of all Member States, on all \r\nconference-related issues, including arrangements for \r\nstrengthening the process, such as the establishment \r\nof a commission on financing for development, in \r\naccordance with paragraph 33 of resolution 67/199, \r\nand also taking into account the recommendations \r\ncontained in the report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nmodalities of the financing for development follow-up \r\nprocess (A/67/353).\r\nVenezuela welcomes the decision of the President \r\nof the General Assembly to convene during the sixty-\r\neighth session a separate meeting of the Second \r\nCommittee on the topic of macroeconomic policy \r\nquestions to discuss actions in response to the world \r\nfinancial and economic crisis and its impact on \r\ndevelopment. Further contributions to follow up on this \r\nconference are necessary, and we cannot delay further \r\naction. The world is waiting. Venezuela encourages all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations at this session \r\nto consider the recommendations contained in of \r\nEconomic and Social Council resolution 2011/39, on the \r\nestablishment of a United Nations panel of experts on \r\nthe reform of the international financial system.\r\nVenezuela recalls the Commission of Experts \r\ncreated by the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-third session, Father Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, on reforms of the international monetary \r\nand financial system and underlines the importance of \r\nits work and contribution contributing to the follow-up \r\nto the conference. The Commission’s work contributed \r\nsignificantly to informing Member States on \r\ninternational action and international decision-making \r\naiming to provide intellectual support, technical \r\nexpertise, analysis and key recommendations, and \r\nfostering constructive dialogue and exchange among \r\npolicymakers, academics and institutions.\r\nVenezuela recommends that the issues to be \r\naddressed by a commission of experts of the United \r\nNations should include global stimulus, follow-\r\nup processes, financing for restructuring, trade \r\nstimulation, debt relief, a moratorium of debt work-out \r\nprocesses, special drawing rights allocations, global \r\nand regional reserve systems, special drawing rights \r\nand development finance, development finance and \r\nUnited Nations institutional arrangements, a financial \r\ntransaction tax, the regulation and coordination of the \r\nneed for holding a follow-up conference. Moreover, it \r\nwould be prudent to consider holding the High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development twice a year, \r\nso as to more immediately address the challenges \r\nfacing many countries, including the ongoing financial \r\nand economic crisis, food and energy crises and the \r\nchallenges posed by climate change. My delegation \r\nwould also like to stress the central role of the United \r\nNations in financing for development and the need in \r\nour ongoing deliberations to address the fragmentation \r\nof financing while addressing development in general.\r\nFinally, I should say that South Africa, as a member \r\nof the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing, attaches great \r\nimportance to mobilizing resources for achieving \r\nsustainable development and eradicating poverty.\r\nMr. Ovalles-Santos (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): My delegation would \r\nlike to commend the holding today of this High-level \r\nDialogue on Financing for Development. Venezuela \r\nfully endorses the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina (see A/68/PV.29).\r\nVenezuela reaffirms the content of paragraph 90 \r\nof the outcome document of the Doha Declaration on \r\nFinancing for Development, and of resolution 67/199 \r\nregarding the decision to hold informal consultations \r\naimed at reaching a final decision on the need for a \r\nfollow-up conference on financing for development and \r\nconvening it by 2013. In that regard, we urge that action \r\nbe taken on updated draft resolution A/67/L.71 by the \r\nend of October, in order that a follow-up conference \r\nfor reviewing the implementation of the Monterrey \r\nConsensus and the Doha Declaration be held before the \r\nend of 2015, with a view to contributing to the process \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nVenezuela would like to raise the importance of \r\nestablishing an appropriate follow-up mechanism \r\nwithin the United Nations system, such as a financing \r\nfor development committee that is a subsidiary of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, in order to bridge the \r\ngap between policymaking and the implementation \r\nof commitments, and to ensure the necessary support \r\nfor the implementation of internationally agreed-on \r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nVenezuela urges the launch of a preparatory \r\nprocess for a follow-up conference, and to that end \r\nasks the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\n13-50232 21/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\ncrisis; the food crisis; and the macroeconomic policy \r\ncrisis — it has become clear that countries have failed \r\nto solve the financial crisis of 2008.\r\nThat recent financial crisis has shifted the \r\ncontours of the economy, which has impacted national \r\neconomies. Once again, it is the population, the \r\nworld’s poor, who end up paying the price for the crisis \r\ncreated by capitalism and the minority who privatize \r\nthe gains of the system and socialize its losses. This \r\nis capitalism — a system that does not accommodate \r\nus all and that will always have few winners and many \r\nlosers, among them Mother Earth.\r\nWe are also facing a profound ideological, \r\nethical and moral crisis. We are facing the decline of \r\ncapitalist civilization. We are putting at risk not only \r\nthe only home we have, but life on the planet itself, \r\nour very existence as humankind. This is why many \r\neconomists and scientists are today dusting off their \r\ncopies of Marx to understand what is happening in \r\nthe capitalist world. He, too, understood that there \r\nexists an antagonistic relationship between capitalism \r\nand nature: the fundamental contradiction between \r\npotentially unlimited wealth accumulation and the \r\nfinite character of certain natural resources. That is \r\nwhy we cannot disassociate economic approaches that \r\nseek harmony with Mother Earth from anticapitalist \r\neconomic approaches that seek to rescue the original \r\nessence of economy and society.\r\nIt is from this perspective that the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia, together with other countries, proposed \r\nthat all the peoples of the world adopt well-being as \r\nan economic, political and civilizational paradigm. It \r\nis an alternative to capitalism, born in the ancestral \r\ncultures of indigenous peoples of the land, which seeks \r\nthe production and reproduction of life, not of profit. \r\nThus we are talking about an economy for life, which \r\novercomes not only the exploitation of man by man, but \r\nalso the exploitation of nature by man.\r\nSince 2006, with the Government of President \r\nEvo Morales Ayma, we have planned and built in our \r\ncountry a community-based productive socioeconomic \r\nmodel, which has attained significant results, \r\nespecially in poverty reduction, universal access to \r\nprimary resources and revenue redistribution. We have \r\nachieved those results by nationalizing and developing \r\nour strategic natural resources.\r\nHowever, we must not lose sight of the fact that, \r\nwhile the so-called developed countries have higher \r\nglobal economy, and the restructuring of international \r\ninstitutions — all within the context of the strengthening \r\nof the role of the United Nations.\r\nVenezuela also urges that the agreement between \r\nthe United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions \r\nbe reviewed, in collaboration with those institutions. \r\nBearing in mind the decision of the first South Summit \r\nand its programme of action, which encouraged the \r\nestablishment of a group of experts, in their individual \r\ncapacities, to review and comment on the agendas of \r\nmajor United Nations multilateral conferences with \r\na view to providing guidance on the objectives and \r\ngoals of developing countries, Venezuela reiterates \r\nthe recommendation to establish a panel of experts of \r\nthe South on the reform of the international financial \r\nsystem.\r\nVenezuela also recalls the recommendation \r\ncontained in resolution 63/303 to hold a follow-up \r\nconference on the financial and economic crisis and \r\nits impact on development and on the continuation of \r\nthe work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group \r\nof the General Assembly to follow up on the issues \r\ncontained in the Outcome of the Conference on the \r\nWorld Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact \r\non Development. In this regard, we welcome the \r\nrecommendation of the South Centre to follow up on \r\nand implement all mandates through regional and \r\nsubregional arrangements and institutions in the South, \r\nincluding the South Summit.\r\nFinally, Venezuela regrets the lack of engagement \r\non the side of developed countries on the follow-up to \r\nthe Conference on the Financial Crisis. However, we \r\nalso recall the commitment to work in solidarity on a \r\ncoordinated and comprehensive global response to the \r\nongoing adverse impacts of the world economic and \r\nfinancial crisis on development.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): The delegation of the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/68/PV.29).\r\nOn this occasion, the Assembly serves as a space \r\nfor us to reflect together on the economy and on the \r\neconomic models being implemented by countries \r\naround the world. As our planet faces multiple, \r\ninterconnected and mutually exacerbating crises — the \r\nfinancial crisis; the climate crisis, which is becoming \r\nan ecological collapse, the water crisis; the energy \r\n22/23 13-50232\r\nA/68/PV.30 07/10/2013\r\nnumerous and complex. Bolivia is doing its humble \r\npart by building an economy for life wherein the \r\nneeds of the individual are taken into consideration \r\nthrough a collective effort, one that is in harmony \r\nwith Mother Earth, involving all of us. Of course, that \r\nposes tremendous challenges, especially when there \r\nis poverty, but we are ready to work towards change, \r\nin the knowledge that no single country can solve the \r\nproblem and that we must work together, which is why \r\nwe are here. Now more than ever before, we must fight \r\nfor life, a fight that is incumbent upon all of us.\r\nMs. Nazaire (Haiti) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation fully aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby Fiji, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Вelize and Benin on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, the small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nand the least developed countries (LDCS), respectively \r\n(see A/68/PV.29). We would like to thank the President \r\nof the General Assembly for holding this essential \r\nHigh-level Dialogue on International Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the Secretary-General.\r\nAs a least developed country and a small island \r\ndeveloping State, Haiti is firmly convinced that all \r\nstakeholders should redouble their efforts in order to \r\nensure that the specific recommendations made in the \r\nfinancing for development process, including those in \r\nthe Istanbul and Barbados Programmes of Action and \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, are \r\nfully implemented. At the same time, it is also of the \r\nutmost importance that we consolidate and pursue the \r\nundeniable progress made following the Monterrey \r\nConsensus, the Doha Declaration and the related United \r\nNations conferences, even though it was insufficient.\r\nMy delegation is confident that the outcome of the \r\nDialogue will help us accelerate and refine ways of \r\nreaching the levels, meeting the targets and identifying \r\npractical modalities for development aid that are in line \r\nwith the ambitious objectives set by the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the forthcoming post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nHaiti is aware of the importance of foreign direct \r\ninvestment, the only option to have proved itself \r\ncapable of fostering sustained development. We are \r\nnow engaged in the recovery phase and in post-disaster \r\ngrowth and have an improved business environment \r\ncreated by the Government. National and, above all, \r\nforeign private capital are playing a primary role in \r\nincomes and fewer unsatisfied needs, middle-income \r\ncountries still have to generate the material conditions \r\nto resolve historically unmet needs and to eradicate \r\npoverty and the economic dependence that capitalism \r\nhas imposed on us. We need to industrialize our natural \r\nresources and develop ourselves to cease being mere \r\nsuppliers of raw materials for industrialized countries. \r\nHowever, we are aware that industrialization has an \r\nimpact on Mother Earth. What we have to do is promote \r\nan ecologically sound mode of production and clean \r\nindustry. But the cost will be much higher than that \r\nof conventional industry — a cost that many countries \r\nwill be unable to meet. This is a fact that we must face.\r\nWe cannot try to compensate for the impact of \r\nsuch pillage by adopting a carbon-emission trading \r\nsystem based on yet further expansion of capitalist \r\nmarkets, nor by promoting a green economy that is \r\npart of the twenty-first century brand of colonialism \r\nthat commercializes the natural wellspring of life and \r\ncompels us in the countries of the South to be poor \r\nforest-keepers, as President Evo Morales has stated on \r\nseveral occasions.\r\nHow can we produce, grow and develop while \r\nappropriately distributing and redistributing wealth \r\nand income? How can we speed up the growth of \r\ncurrent modes of production knowing that it will lead \r\nus to an ecological collapse that would put the survival \r\nof humankind at risk? We know very well that this can \r\nbring about severe economic and social crises. So, how \r\ncan we strike a balance? These are questions we must \r\nask ourselves, as we set out, at a time when capitalism is \r\nundergoing a structural crisis, to create new economic \r\nmodels and to make significant changes in the structure \r\nand architecture of global financial systems.\r\nWe must enlist the decisive participation of \r\ndeveloping countries, thereby building a financial \r\nsystem that is designed to eradicate poverty and \r\npromote sustainable development, with full respect \r\nfor the development visions, models, focus and tools \r\nof individual countries. That would include promoting \r\nrespect for the sovereign decisions of countries, while \r\ndoing away with all forms of colonialism — instead \r\nof turning international financial organizations into \r\nregulators that intervene and monitor our economies \r\nand societies, prescribing models of development and \r\nusing debt to bribe us or imposing policies that have \r\nlittle to do with our realities.\r\nFinally, Bolivia would like to point out that the \r\nsolution is by no means simple. Economic realities are \r\n13-50232 23/23\r\n07/10/2013 A/68/PV.30\r\nthis funding would dangerously undermine such an \r\nachievement.\r\nHowever, beyond the need to maintain and increase \r\nthe level and range of public funding available for \r\ndevelopment, we must, once again, urgently draw the \r\ninternational community’s attention to the challenges \r\nand contradictions that have arisen from mobilizing \r\nand channelling ODA. Many speakers have already \r\nreferred to concessional loans, the vicious circle of \r\ndebt and the obstacles blocking access to international \r\ncommerce and fair trade. Haiti’s experience over the \r\npast two decades obliges us to add to that list of dubious \r\nand, in the long run, totally counterproductive practices \r\nthe systematic handing over to non-governmental \r\norganizations — however worthy they may be — most \r\nor all of the task of funding and managing bilateral or \r\nmultilateral projects. To do so may diminish the overall \r\ncohesion or impair the effectiveness and outcome, \r\nthereby further reducing the ability of modestly \r\nendowed States to strengthen their capacity to craft and \r\nexecute development projects for their people.\r\nMy delegation believes that it would be useful \r\nto build on the efforts made in recent years by the \r\nUnited Nations development system itself that are \r\naimed at streamlining its cooperation frameworks and \r\nintegrating and harmonizing the work of its numerous \r\nagencies, funds and programmes, whether it be on the \r\nground, in their relations with one another or, most \r\nespecially, in terms of the strategic development options \r\ndefined by the host country.\r\nIn conclusion — and I will put this as simply as \r\npossible — we all know that in the area of financing \r\nfor development, quality is as important as quantity. \r\nWe must therefore begin forthwith a frank, transparent \r\nand inclusive discussion to consider any lessons that we \r\nshould apply in our global and local approach to this \r\nissue.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.30 p.m.\r\nour current economic growth. For two years now, the \r\nlevel of foreign direct investment in the manufacturing \r\nsector, in development infrastructures and in tourism, \r\nin particular, has been unprecedented.\r\nHaiti has also explored new paths, such as South-\r\nSouth cooperation, which is currently expanding \r\nrapidly. In addition, we have innovated by actively \r\npromoting the earmarking of resources from expatriate \r\nremittances. Because of this, Haiti is on its way to \r\nproviding primary education for all and achieving \r\nMDG 2, well before all previous predictions.\r\nHowever, owing to the limited scope of such \r\nalternative mechanisms, and since Haiti has scant \r\naccess to the main capital markets, official development \r\nassistance (ODA) remains critical for countries like ours, \r\nparticularly for all low-budget and short-term projects \r\nand programmes, even though they would, in the long \r\nterm, be most helpful in terms of building governance \r\nand the other economic, social and environmental \r\ninfrastructure without which sustainable development \r\ncannot be realized. For example, the impact of the \r\nglobal financial crisis in 2008 and the decline in ODA \r\nthat followed dealt a severe blow to the extremely \r\npositive momentum that had led to the early attainment \r\nof MDGs. Having received vital aid, virtually from the \r\nentire world, immediately after the 2010 earthquake, \r\nHaiti has first-hand knowledge in that area.\r\nYet, our main partners have been slow in meeting \r\nthe generous promises they made  at that time with \r\nrespect to the financing of reconstruction and \r\ndevelopment projects. Similarly, the progress made \r\nin attaining the MDGs is largely due to bilateral and \r\nmultilateral development assistance. For example, a \r\nbroad and well-coordinated international aid system, \r\nsupported by the United States President’s Emergency \r\nPlan for AIDS Relief and the Joint United Nations \r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS, has helped more than halve \r\nthe rate of HIV/AIDS prevalence in Haiti.
