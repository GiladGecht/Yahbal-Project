"In the absence of the President, Mr. Errázuriz \r\n(Chile), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 5.40 p.m.\r\nHigh-level Dialogue on Financing for Development\r\nAgenda item 18 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to and implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe 2002 International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment and the 2008 Review Conference\r\nThe Acting President: I shall now read the \r\nconcluding remarks of the President of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nWe have come to the conclusion of the sixth High-\r\nlevel Dialogue on Financing for Development. I would \r\nlike to express my appreciation to all delegations that \r\nparticipated. Their constructive interventions have \r\ncontributed to the successful outcome of the meeting. I \r\nam grateful to the Secretary-General, the Vice-President \r\nof the Economic and Social Council and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development for their opening remarks (see A/68/\r\nPV29), which were followed by many thoughtful \r\nstatements by representatives of Member States and \r\ninstitutional stakeholders in the plenary meetings.\r\nI am also very pleased with the valuable \r\ncontributions of others — institutional stakeholders, \r\ncivil society and the private sector — who engaged in \r\na true dialogue in our round tables and the informal \r\ninteractive dialogue. The interactive nature of our \r\ndiscussions and the participation of such a wide range \r\nof stakeholders exemplify the inclusive spirit of the \r\nfinancing for development process. All of their remarks \r\nhave provided an important reminder that we need to \r\nuphold the foundations of the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment as set out in the Monterrey Consensus and \r\nthe Doha Declaration on Financing for Development, \r\nas we accelerate the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and move towards the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nA full summary of the High-level Dialogue will be \r\nmade available at a later date. At this point, I would \r\nlike to highlight some key points expressed over the \r\npast two days.\r\nThere was a broad consensus among all participants \r\nthat the Monterrey Consensus and Doha Declaration \r\non Financing for Development provided a strong \r\nconceptual underpinning for future discussions on \r\nfinancing for development.\r\nParticipants agreed that we should avoid any \r\nduplication of effort and arrive at a coherent financing \r\nframework for a unified post-2015 development agenda \r\nwith sustainability at its core. Such a financing strategy \r\nshould build on existing international agreements, as \r\nenshrined in the Monterrey Consensus, the Doha \r\nDeclaration and related outcomes of major United \r\nNations conferences and summits.\r\nAs the world has changed considerably over the past \r\n10 years, the conceptual framework needs to be adapted \r\nto new circumstances and challenges, particularly those \r\nrelated to the integration of the social, economic and \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.31\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n31st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 8 October 2013, 5.45 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The development \r\nand adaptation of international financial regulations \r\nwould benefit from the greater representation and \r\nparticipation of developing countries in the regulatory \r\nreform process.\r\nInstitutional investors, such as pension funds \r\nand sovereign wealth funds, that have long-term \r\nliabilities are an important potential source for long-\r\nterm financing for sustainable development. However, \r\nto date their investment in critical areas, such as \r\ninfrastructure, environmental financing, innovation \r\nand small and medium enterprises, remains limited. It \r\nwas pointed out that there was a need to better align \r\ninvestor incentives with long-term investment.\r\nForeign direct investment inflows, one of the most \r\nstable private sources of international capital, have been \r\nfalling globally. However, the decline has been greatest \r\nin developed countries, with inflows to resource-rich \r\nleast developed countries remaining strong. In that \r\ncontext, policies to promote long-term sustainable \r\nforeign direct investment are needed, especially in \r\nareas such as environmental investments.\r\nIn that context, participants stressed that the private \r\nsector would not invest unless there were profitable \r\nbankable investments. Representatives from the private \r\nsector pointed to a number of structural constraints that \r\nprevented investment in developing countries, including \r\nregulatory risks and weak institutions. It was pointed \r\nout that public financing could play a complementary \r\nrole in helping developing countries overcome those \r\nobstacles and in leveraging private financing.\r\nDomestic resource mobilization remains critical. \r\nSince it is ultimately driven by inclusive and sustained \r\neconomic growth, domestic resource mobilization is \r\nkey to ensuring effective domestic macroeconomic \r\npolicymaking and an enabling international \r\nenvironment.\r\nDeveloping countries face a range of common \r\nchallenges in raising resources, and that is particularly \r\npronounced in the most vulnerable countries. Those \r\ncountries must continue to build their capacity to collect \r\npublic revenues. The strengthening of international \r\ntax cooperation must continue in that regard. Several \r\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development. \r\nMany of those issues have already been incorporated in \r\nthe financing for development process. In that context, \r\nmany participants noted the important role of the \r\nrecently established Intergovernmental Committee of \r\nExperts on Sustainable Development Financing, which \r\nwill propose options on an effective financing strategy \r\nfor sustainable development.\r\nMany delegations called for the follow-up \r\ninternational conference on financing for development \r\nto be held before the end of 2015, in order for the \r\nconference to contribute meaningfully to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. Delegations called for \r\nintergovernmental consultations on issues related to \r\nthe conference, with the participation of all Member \r\nStates, to begin before the end of 2013. There were also \r\ncalls for a financing for development commission as a \r\nsubsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council \r\nto bridge the gap between policy-making and the \r\nimplementation of commitments.\r\nWhile recognizing that much had been achieved \r\nsince the Millennium Declaration was adopted, in \r\n2000, we must redouble our efforts to accelerate \r\nprogress towards achieving the MDGs. Since progress \r\nin reaching the development goals has been uneven \r\nbetween and within countries, we must focus on the \r\ngoals that are most off-track and on countries that face \r\nparticular development challenges.\r\nMore than five years since the global financial \r\nand economic crisis, the international financial system \r\ncontinues to be plagued by vulnerability. The sovereign \r\ndebt crisis in Europe and the uneven global recovery \r\nhave led to heightened risk aversion. The de-leveraging \r\nof financial institutions continues, particularly in \r\nEurope.\r\nAlthough growth prospects for 2014 appear to \r\nhave slightly improved, risks remain. In particular, \r\nunconventional monetary measures adopted in major \r\ndeveloped countries have spillover effects on emerging \r\neconomies. At the same time, there is a risk that an \r\nearly undoing of those measures could impact the \r\nnascent recovery in some developed countries and \r\ncreate additional volatility in developing countries.\r\nWhile financing needs for sustainable development \r\nare extremely large, they represent a relatively small \r\nportion of global savings. The challenge lies in \r\nfacilitating an international financial system that would \r\n13-50432 3/3\r\n08/10/2013 A/68/PV.31\r\nSovereign debt is another important area of \r\ndevelopment financing. Today, debt overhangs \r\nin developing countries are relatively limited. \r\nNevertheless, some developing countries remain \r\ncritically indebted, and the debt of developed countries \r\ncontinues to pose a risk for the global economy, and \r\ntherefore needs timely and effective resolution. In order \r\nto enhance the role of foreign borrowing for growth \r\nand development, efforts are needed to strengthen \r\nthree pillars: responsible lending and borrowing; debt \r\nmanagement; and a framework for sovereign-debt \r\nrestructuring. There were calls for the United Nations \r\nto guide an institution-building process to establish \r\na debt work-out mechanism, with fair and equitable \r\nrepresentation of the interests of debtors.\r\nOur discussions over the past two days have been \r\nquite instructive and inspiring. We have built momentum \r\ntowards redoubling efforts in achieving the MDGs and \r\ntowards advancing the United Nations development \r\nagenda beyond 2015. In participants’ statements, I heard \r\ngenuine concern about the uncertainty of development \r\nprospects for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable, \r\nbut also for donor countries, which are now faced with \r\nmounting debts and tight budgets.\r\nHowever, I have also sensed optimism that we can \r\ncome together to meet the challenges of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The resources are there; they just \r\nneed to be allocated effectively. That requires a true \r\nmulti-stakeholder effort and a global partnership \r\nencompassing all stakeholders, in order to expedite \r\nthe mobilization of financial resources for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, both public and private, at the national, \r\nregional and international levels.\r\nI thank participants very much for their attendance \r\nand participation in this event.\r\nI now declare closed the sixth High-level Dialogue \r\non Financing for Development.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.55 p.m.\r\ndelegations proposed to upgrade the Committee of \r\nExperts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters to \r\nan intergovernmental body.\r\nThe pressures on public finances in many donor \r\ncountries following the global crisis led to a fall in \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) and a reduction \r\nof fiscal space. That development could threaten \r\nthe gains made by many developing countries, least \r\ndeveloped countries in particular, in achieving the \r\nMDGs. A renewed effort by major donors is necessary \r\nto reach ODA commitments of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income (GNI), with a target of 0.15 to 0.20 per \r\ncent of GNI to the least developed countries by 2015, \r\ntaking into account the quality of such aid.\r\nThe expansion of South-South cooperation is a \r\nwelcome development. It should not be seen, however, \r\nas a substitute for traditional aid f lows, but rather as \r\ncomplementary financing and technical resources for \r\ndevelopment. There were some calls for increased \r\ndialogue among traditional and emerging donors to \r\nincrease coherence in the aid architecture. In addition, \r\ninnovative sources of financing were seen as having \r\npotential, but should be seen as additional to existing \r\nODA.\r\nThere were also calls for an early conclusion to \r\nthe Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations of \r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO). During the past \r\nyear, the recovery in world trade following the financial \r\ncrisis lost momentum, mostly through weakened \r\ndemand in developed countries. In particular, the least \r\ndeveloped countries’ share in global trade remains \r\nlow, at only 1.1 per cent. The Doha Round has the \r\npotential to contribute significantly to more equitable \r\nand inclusive growth. The ministerial conference of \r\nthe WTO to be held in Bali in December could lead to \r\nprogress in important areas, including trade facilitation, \r\nagriculture negotiation and development.\r\n"
