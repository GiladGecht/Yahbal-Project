"The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 138 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/68/504)\r\nThe President: If there is no proposal under rule 66 \r\nof the rules of procedure, may I take it that the General \r\nAssembly decides not to discuss the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee that is before the Assembly today?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Statements will therefore be \r\nlimited to explanations of vote. The positions of \r\ndelegations regarding the recommendation of the Fifth \r\nCommittee have been made clear in the Committee and \r\nare reflected in the relevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 \r\nof decision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that \r\nwhen the same draft resolution is considered in a \r\nMain Committee and in plenary meeting, a delegation \r\nshould, as far as possible, explain its vote only once, \r\nthat is, either in the Committee or in plenary meeting, \r\nunless that delegation’s vote in plenary meeting is \r\ndifferent from its vote in the Committee. I also remind \r\ndelegations that, also in accordance with decision \r\n34/401, explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendation contained in the report of the Fifth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take a decision in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on the draft \r\nresolution recommended by the Fifth Committee in \r\nparagraph 6 of its report. The Fifth Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution, entitled “Scale of assessments \r\nfor the apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations: requests under Article 19 of the Charter”, \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 68/5).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 138.\r\nAgenda items 14 and 118 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nDraft resolution (A/68/L.4)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that under \r\nagenda items 14 and 118, the Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 68/1 at its 2nd plenary meeting, on \r\n20 September. Members are reminded that the debate \r\non agenda item 14 and agenda item 118 will be held \r\njointly with item 125, entitled “United Nations reform: \r\nmeasures and proposals”, on 20 November.\r\nPermit me now to make a statement.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.32\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 9 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

That means that new \r\nlevels of support, collaboration and partnership will \r\nbe needed from all stakeholders. Earlier this week we \r\nheard how reliable financing will be critical in driving \r\nthis dual-track process. Countries will need to make \r\nevery effort to mobilize domestic resources, yet at \r\nthe same time there is a vital role and need for donor \r\ncountries to meet their official development assistance \r\ncommitments, including through the provision of \r\nreliable and timely financial resources.\r\nDuring this session of the General Assembly, a \r\nnumber of ongoing processes will begin to converge \r\nin preparation for consideration and, ultimately, \r\nnegotiations at the start of the sixty-ninth session. \r\nThe outcome document speaks to these processes, \r\nemphasizing the need to achieve meaningful, balanced \r\nand forward-looking arrangements and results within \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts \r\non Sustainable Development Financing, and in the \r\nprocess to develop options for a mechanism facilitating \r\nthe transfer of technology. My team and I stand ready \r\nto provide assistance in this collective quest as the \r\nAssembly makes progress in all these areas.\r\nThe document also underscores that the preparation \r\nfor the post-2015 development agenda will benefit \r\nfrom the three high-level events and the three thematic \r\ndebates I will convene during the second part of the \r\nsixty-eighth session. My team and I will endeavour to \r\nmake them complementary and mutually reinforcing \r\nso as to enable further progress on each and every one \r\nof the priority areas I have identified, all of which are \r\nreflected in the outcome document.\r\nWhile there is much to be done, we can now say that \r\nwe have begun the intergovernmental process aimed at \r\nputting in place a post-2015 development agenda, which \r\nwill require sustained and committed work from each \r\nand every member. This is indeed an exciting time for \r\nour United Nations. I welcome the adoption of this \r\nresolution, and I look forward to setting the stage for \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda together with all in \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.4, entitled “Outcome document of the special \r\nevent to follow up efforts made towards achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals”. In connection \r\nIt is my pleasure to present for adoption the \r\noutcome document that was endorsed by Heads of \r\nState and Government and heads of delegations at last \r\nweek’s special event to follow up efforts made towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nAt the outset, I wish to highlight that this outcome \r\ndocument is, first and foremost, a call for action in \r\nthe accelerated commitment to address the gaps and \r\nunevenness in the MDG process and to respond to the \r\nformidable challenges that remain on the path to their \r\nfulfilment.\r\nMany here will no doubt recall that at the special \r\nevent I invited the Secretary-General to compile a \r\nmatrix of commitments pledged by Member States, \r\ninternational organizations, private-sector partners \r\nand civil society associated with the acceleration of the \r\nachievement of the MDGs. The final results will soon \r\nbe made available, but initially several billion dollars \r\nhave been mobilized, and actions and pledges are \r\ncoming from dozens of countries. With some 825 days \r\nto go, we must remain vigilant in our collective quest to \r\nfulfil the MDGs.\r\nThe document before the Assembly for adoption \r\nalso sets the initial signposts to define an ambitious and \r\ninclusive post-2015 development agenda. Our collective \r\ncommitment to this text should catalyse a final push to \r\ncreate real and meaningful change by making further \r\nprogress on the MDGs and defining the contours of \r\na development agenda with the potential to have an \r\nimpact on the trajectory of sustainable development for \r\ndecades to come.\r\nSuch an agreement required a collective sense \r\nof partnership by all parties. I pay special tribute to \r\nparticipants’ collective efforts under the able leadership \r\nof the Permanent Representatives of Ireland and South \r\nAfrica, whom I wish to commend today for their \r\ntireless efforts. I wish also to highlight the invaluable \r\nstewardship of our Secretary-General and his dedicated \r\nteam for their efforts aimed at ensuring a systemic \r\ncommitment to an integrated development framework.\r\nI readily acknowledge the fact that this outcome \r\ndocument, however significant, represents just a first \r\nstep in a series of efforts that will require us to work \r\ncollectively between now and 2015 if we are to achieve \r\nthe dual goals of fulfilling the remaining MDGs and \r\nlaunching a successor arrangement that is the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\n13-50522 3/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nMr. Thomson (Fiji): I have the honour to make this \r\nstatement on behalf of the Group of 77 and China. The \r\nGroup welcomes the adoption of resolution 68/6.\r\nFirst let me express the Group’s appreciation to you, \r\nMr. President, for submitting the outcome document \r\nof the special event to follow up efforts made towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand for its adoption today by the General Assembly. \r\nI wish also to convey the Group’s appreciation to the \r\nco-facilitators of the consultation process for this \r\noutcome document — the Permanent Representatives \r\nof South Africa and Ireland, whose tireless efforts \r\nand commitment have ensured that we have arrived \r\nsuccessfully at this important occasion today. We wish \r\nto underscore the importance of this outcome document \r\nto us, as the Group of 77 (G-77) and China, and to the \r\nGeneral Assembly in capturing our collective will as \r\nwe move forward steadfastly towards achieving our \r\ndevelopment aspirations for this millennium.\r\nWhile the Millennium Development Goals were \r\nfocused on developing countries, what has been outlined \r\nin the outcome document is intended to result in the \r\nformulation of a post-2015 development agenda that is \r\napplicable to all. The road map set out in the document \r\nensures that the international community as a whole \r\nis involved and engaged throughout in a transparent \r\nintergovernmental process to\r\n“craft a strong post-2015 development agenda, \r\nthat will build on the foundations laid by the \r\nMillennium Development goals, complete the \r\nunfinished business and respond to new challenges” \r\n(resolution 68/6, para. 16).\r\nDuring the special event, our leaders expressed \r\nthe view that we should take advantage of this historic \r\nopportunity to reaffirm our collective political \r\ncommitment and redouble our efforts to accelerate the \r\nachievement of the MDGs with a sense of urgency and \r\ndetermination.\r\nAs we set our sights on the framework that will \r\ntake us beyond 2015, it is important that we reaffirm \r\nour resolve that our work must remain guided by the \r\nprinciples and values enshrined in the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), the outcome document \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 66/288, annex), and the \r\noutcomes of all the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits in the economic, social and related fields.\r\nwith the draft resolution, I shall give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): In connection with draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.4, entitled “Outcome document of \r\nthe special event to follow up efforts made towards \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals”, I wish \r\nto put on record, on behalf of the Secretary-General, \r\nthe following statement on the financial implications, \r\nin accordance with rule 153 of the rules of procedure of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nIn operative paragraph 26 of the draft resolution, \r\nthe General Assembly would request the President \r\nof the General Assembly to convene, in a timely \r\nmanner, intergovernmental consultations to achieve \r\nagreement on organizational modalities for a summit \r\nfor the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nUnder the terms of paragraph 26, the decision on the \r\norganizational aspects and the dates of the summit \r\nare yet to be determined. Therefore, in the absence \r\nof modalities for meetings and documentation of the \r\nsummit, it is not possible at present to determine the \r\nconference servicing requirements. Thus, as soon \r\nas specific decisions on the dates, format, scope and \r\nmodalities are determined, the matter will be reported \r\nto the Assembly in accordance with rule 153 of its rules \r\nof procedure.\r\nThe date of the meeting will have to be determined in \r\nconsultation with the Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management. Should the Assembly \r\nadopt draft resolution A/68/L.4, the Secretary-General \r\nwill submit details of the financial implications, if \r\napplicable, in accordance with established procedures \r\nwhen the modalities of the meeting are determined.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take \r\na decision on draft resolution A/68/L.4, entitled \r\n“Outcome document of the special event to follow \r\nup efforts made towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals”. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt the draft resolution?\r\nDraft resolution A/68/L.4 was adopted (resolution \r\n68/6).\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Fiji, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\n4/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nMDGs special event and its outcome will help us in this \r\nimportant endeavour.\r\nIn closing, on behalf of Ambassador Mamabolo \r\nand myself, may I thank you, Sir, and your predecessor \r\nMr. Jeremić for your leadership, and the Secretariat’s \r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs, conference \r\nservices and others in the United Nations system for \r\ntheir assistance. Finally, once again, I thank colleagues \r\nfor their advice, assistance and hard work in agreeing \r\nthe outcome document that we have just adopted.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Mayr-Harting (European Union): On behalf \r\nof the European Union and its member States, let me \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on the way in which \r\nyou chaired the special event. Let me also congratulate \r\nyou on your decision to place the subjects that were on \r\nthe agenda of the special event and the whole post-2015 \r\nissue at the heart of your presidency.\r\nI should also like to thank the two co-facilitators, \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of South Africa and \r\nIreland, for their tireless efforts. Their work is greatly \r\nappreciated.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of the outcome document \r\n(resolution 68/6), which represents a key step forward \r\nand a good balance between the positions expressed \r\nover months of consultations. We welcome the fact that \r\nit captures in a concise manner key messages both on \r\nthe final push towards the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in the run-up to 2015, and on charting the \r\nway forward post-2015. The document is particularly \r\nvaluable in underscoring that we face common \r\nchallenges and have a shared agenda. It paves the way \r\nfor a more sustainable, equitable and prosperous world \r\nfor all, a world free of poverty.\r\nWe welcome the resolve to target the most off-\r\ntrack MDGs and that among and within developing \r\ncountries, those that have been left furthest behind \r\nrequire our most urgent attention and support. We \r\nwelcome the emphasis on the Monterrey/Doha \r\nframework on financing for development as a key \r\nreference point. National ownership, with each country \r\nbearing the primary responsibility for its development, \r\nand the mobilization of all resources, public and \r\nprivate, domestic and international, and their effective \r\nand innovative use will be crucial to implementing the \r\nfuture framework.\r\nWe wish also to reiterate that the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities is of paramount \r\nimportance as a guiding principle in crafting the \r\nfuture development agenda. As developing countries, \r\nwe reaffirm our conviction that the new development \r\nagenda must take into account our differing national \r\ncircumstances and development priorities.\r\nIn line with the request reflected in paragraph \r\n26 of the outcome document — that the President of \r\nthe General Assembly convene, in a timely manner, \r\nintergovernmental consultations to achieve agreement \r\non organizational modalities for the development \r\nsummit in 2015 — I wish to express the readiness of the \r\nG-77 and China to work with you, Sir, and our partners \r\nin making that a reality.\r\nMr. Donoghue (Ireland): I make these remarks \r\non behalf of both co-facilitators of the special event. \r\nIt was a great honour and privilege for me and for \r\nmy predecessor, Anne Anderson, to be appointed \r\nco-facilitator of the special event, along with my \r\ncolleague, Ambassador Mamabolo of South Africa. \r\nI am therefore particularly pleased to be present for \r\nthe formal adoption of the outcome document of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals special event as \r\nresolution 68/6, following its endorsement by our Heads \r\nof State and Government and heads of delegations on \r\n25 September.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to warmly \r\nthank colleagues for their hard work over many months \r\nin coming to an agreement on this important consensus \r\noutcome document. It is one that we can be very pleased \r\nwith. It makes very clear the urgency of accelerating \r\nprogress towards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in all developing countries, \r\nand particularly in those countries most lagging behind. \r\nIt calls for particular attention to be paid to the most \r\noff-track MDGs and to those who are most vulnerable \r\nand disadvantaged. It highlights the central role of \r\nthe strengthened global partnership for development. \r\nIt sets out the contours of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and a road map to 2015, which will help to guide \r\nour work over the coming two years, culminating in a \r\nsummit in September 2015 for the adoption of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nWe have much to do in these two years. We are \r\nin agreement that we must achieve the promise of the \r\nMDGs. In addition, we will be working to craft an \r\nambitious post-2015 agenda. We firmly believe that the \r\n13-50522 5/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nOur consensus demonstrates the determination of \r\nMember States to reach common ground on topics that \r\nare difficult yet critical for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. This will provide a strong foundation for \r\nour work going forward. As we engage in follow-on \r\ndiscussions we should be mindful of staying within the \r\noverall budget allocations for 2014 and 2015.\r\nMr. Ueda (Japan): My delegation also welcomes \r\nthe adoption of resolution 68/6 today. The special event \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) held \r\ntwo weeks ago was a great success. In that regard, I \r\nwould like to express our sincere appreciation to \r\nyou, Mr. President, and to the co-facilitators, the \r\nAmbassadors of Ireland and South Africa, as well as \r\ntheir team, and the Secretariat for their hard work and \r\ntremendous efforts to lead us to adopt the resolution in \r\nthe General Assembly today.\r\nThe special event and its outcome document provide \r\na great opportunity to renew our political commitment \r\nto achieving the MDGs by the end of 2015. The special \r\nevent also succeeded in laying out a clear work plan to \r\nintegrate various mediation processes on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda with a view to working towards a \r\nsingle framework and set of goals.\r\nWe think that such a process is very important to \r\nformulate an ambitious post-2015 development agenda. \r\nWe therefore look forward to fruitful intergovernmental \r\nconsultations, including on an agreement on \r\norganizational modalities for the summit guided by \r\nyou, Mr. President, and we will constructively engage. \r\nIn this regard, my delegation hopes that the modalities \r\nof the summit to be negotiated and decided will be the \r\nmost efficient and cost-effective.\r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt): I should like to start by \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, and registering our \r\nappreciation of the excellent work done by the two \r\nco-facilitators, the representatives of Ireland and South \r\nAfrica.\r\nI wish to associate my remarks with the statement \r\nand observations delivered earlier by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the adoption of the outcome \r\ndocument and joins the consensus in that regard. In this \r\ncontext, I would like to stress the following points.\r\nPoverty eradication is the greatest global challenge \r\nfacing the world today. Eradicating poverty is an \r\nWith respect to the road map to the post-2015 \r\nframework, we appreciate that key elements have \r\nbeen agreed and are included in the final text, notably \r\nthe need for a coherent approach that integrates in a \r\nbalanced manner the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, working towards a single universal \r\nframework and set of goals, and the reference to peace \r\nand security, gender equality, human rights, the rule of \r\nlaw and democratic governance.\r\nWe will continue to be guided by the values and \r\nprinciples enshrined in previously agreed texts and \r\nreaffirm all the principles of the Rio Declaration on \r\nEnvironment and Development, including, inter alia, the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities \r\nas set out in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration.\r\nWe wish to restate our views on this matter. We \r\nunderline that principle 7 is explicitly related to global \r\nenvironmental degradation and the respective pressures. \r\nAgreeing on the continuous relevance of this principle \r\ncannot be interpreted as its extension to the entirety \r\nof issues to be addressed in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. The world has changed dramatically over the \r\nlast decades, including the nature and magnitude of \r\nour global challenges, their cause and effects, and our \r\nrespective capabilities to address them. The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda needs to respond to these evolving \r\ndynamics. The European Union and its member States \r\nare committed to addressing these evolving realities \r\nand responsibilities, and acknowledge the particular \r\nsituation and concerns of the most vulnerable countries. \r\nAll Member States must play their part in support of \r\ncountries most lagging behind.\r\nWe will engage constructively in all upcoming \r\nprocesses whose outputs will feed into the preparation \r\nof the September 2015 summit. We still have a long \r\nway to go. The stakes have never been so high, the \r\nchallenges never so great. But business as usual is not \r\nan option.\r\nMs. Robl (United States of America): We are very \r\npleased to adopt this outcome document (resolution 68/6) \r\nof the special event on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). The outcome document reflects the \r\nstrength of our collective commitment to fight poverty, \r\naccelerate the achievement of the MDGs, and unite \r\naround a common vision for the future. We would like \r\nto express our particular appreciation for the excellent \r\nfacilitation provided by the Permanent Representatives \r\nof South Africa and Ireland, as well as for your own \r\nrole, Mr. President.\r\n6/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nand adapt to changing trends as well as to anticipate \r\nand address emerging and new challenges accordingly.\r\nASEAN greatly values its cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations. The adoption of the Joint Declaration on \r\nComprehensive Partnership between the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations and the United Nations in 2011 \r\naffirmed the mutual commitment to further advance \r\nand intensify the level of cooperation and to strengthen \r\nthe framework of cooperation between ASEAN and the \r\nUnited Nations. In this connection, we welcome the \r\nadoption of resolution 67/110, entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations”. It identifies important points \r\nof cooperation that will help us to address global issues \r\nof mutual concern, including peace and security, \r\nsustainable growth and development, human rights and \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nASEAN looks forward to the upcoming ASEAN-\r\nUnited Nations summit to be held on 10 October 2013 in \r\nBrunei Darussalam to review ASEAN-United Nations \r\nrelations and to discuss its future direction as well as \r\nto exchange views on regional and international issues. \r\nWe view this summit as an effective tool to strengthen \r\nthe partnership between both organizations.\r\nThe theme for ASEAN this year “Our People, Our \r\nFuture Together” is intended to highlight the important \r\nrole that the people of ASEAN play in its community-\r\nbuilding efforts to help ensure the region’s future. \r\nASEAN believes that each member State can prosper \r\nfrom the success of its neighbours, and at the same \r\ntime individual and collective achievements will also \r\ncontribute to the global development process. In this \r\nconnection, during the recent Summit of the Group of \r\n20 in St. Petersburg, Brunei Darussalam, as ASEAN \r\nChair, affirmed the importance of achieving inclusive \r\nand sustainable growth. That very much remains a core \r\nASEAN goal.\r\nASEAN also remains committed to establishing \r\nthe ASEAN Economic Community by 2015. In this \r\nregard, we will continue to implement cooperation \r\ninitiatives and measures that will support the free \r\nf low of trade, investment and people in the region, \r\nnarrow development gaps and enhance ASEAN’s \r\ncompetitiveness.\r\nTo achieve such inclusive and sustainable growth \r\nand the Millennium Development Goals and to move \r\nforward the post-2015 development agenda, ASEAN \r\nhas also adopted the Bandar Seri Begawan Declaration \r\nindispensable requirement for sustainable development. \r\nThat was reaffirmed at the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development after extensive negotiations \r\nand was finally adopted at the level of Heads of State \r\nand Government at the Conference. We believe that this \r\nbalance should be preserved and not altered.\r\nThe world has undergone far-reaching changes in the \r\npast two decades. Significant progress has been made in \r\nmany important fields of development through national \r\nand international efforts. Yet developing countries \r\nare still facing serious problems in advancing their \r\nlevel of development and changing the unfavourable \r\ninternational economic environment. The number of \r\npeople living in absolute poverty has increased in many \r\ndeveloping countries. In facing these challenges, the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities, \r\nas well as the right to development, remain crucial as \r\na foundation of current and future global development \r\nefforts, in particular for promoting the implementation \r\nof the global partnership for development.\r\nMy delegation understands that the principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities will \r\ncontinue to guide our work with respect to developing \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda items 14 and \r\n118.\r\nAgenda item 111 (continued)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/68/1)\r\nThe President: Members will recall that the \r\nSecretary-General presented his annual report, \r\ndocument A/68/1, to the General Assembly at its 5th \r\nplenary meeting, on 24 September.\r\nMr. Ismail (Brunei Darussalam): I have the honour \r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of the 10 members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN): \r\nBrunei Darussalam, Cambodia, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, \r\nthe Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Viet Nam.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report on the work \r\nof the Organization (A/68/1). The report provides a \r\ncomprehensive and detailed overview of the challenges \r\nand opportunities for this Organization. Indeed, there \r\nis a need for the United Nations constantly to keep up \r\n13-50522 7/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nAdditionally, ASEAN held the ASEAN Regional \r\nForum Disaster Relief Exercise 2013, co-hosted by \r\nThailand and the Republic of Korea from 7 to 11 May. \r\nThat was one of the largest civilian-military exercises \r\nof its kind in the region. Besides that, we welcomed the \r\nMentawai Megathrust Exercise 2013-2014 in Indonesia, \r\nwhich involved the East Asia Summit participating \r\ncountries, from 20 to 26 April. The regional ASEAN \r\nDisaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise will \r\nbe held sometime this month in Viet Nam.\r\nOn peacekeeping, the second meeting of the \r\nADMM-Plus Experts Working Group on Peacekeeping \r\nOperations was held in Manila in June 2012, co-chaired by \r\nthe Philippines and New Zealand. The meeting resulted \r\nin an initial database of profiles of the peacekeeping-\r\nrelated capabilities of participating States. With that \r\ndatabase, areas of complementarity and cooperation can \r\nnow be identified to help further boost the capacities \r\nof participating States, including in the efficient \r\ngeneration of forces for peacekeeping deployment. \r\nWhile the diversity of current peacekeeping operations \r\ncapacity is a challenging reality, peacekeeping offers \r\nrich potential for furthering cooperation among States \r\nwithin and outside ASEAN.\r\nOn human rights, ASEAN adopted the ASEAN \r\nHuman Rights Declaration on 18 November 2012 in \r\nPhnom Penh and acknowledged that that Declaration \r\nwas a milestone in the Association’s efforts to promote \r\nand protect human rights in the region. We also \r\nwelcomed the outcome of the international workshop \r\non enhancing cooperation between United Nations and \r\nregional mechanisms for the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights, held from 12 to 14 December 2012 \r\nin Geneva, as well as the outcome of the Intensive \r\nLearning Workshop on Women’s Human Rights for the \r\nRegional and National Secretariats to ASEAN Human \r\nRights Bodies, held from 18 to 21 March 2013 in Bali, \r\nIndonesia.\r\nTo conclude, we very much hope that the collective \r\nefforts of ASEAN will contribute towards the United \r\nNations own work in promoting peace, security and \r\nstability, as well as inclusive and sustainable growth for \r\nall. It remains fully resolved to work closely to achieve \r\nthose ends.\r\nMr. Misra (India): I am privileged to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly today. Let me congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\r\non Youth Volunteerism and Entrepreneurship. That \r\nDeclaration calls on young professionals to offer \r\nvoluntary community services in areas such as rural \r\ndevelopment and poverty eradication, disaster relief, \r\nhealth, education and the environment, while at the \r\nsame time supporting vulnerable groups and fostering \r\nentrepreneurial skills. In this regard, ASEAN notes \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General in launching the \r\n“Global Education First Initiative” and the appointment \r\nof the first Envoy on Youth.\r\nOn security matters, ASEAN will continue to \r\nremain a net contributor to international peace and \r\nsecurity based on the rule of law and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. ASEAN upholds the Treaty of \r\nAmity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia as an essential \r\ninstrument for governing stable relations between and \r\namong parties within and outside the region. ASEAN \r\nwelcomed Norway’s accession to the Treaty in July \r\n2013.\r\nASEAN supports international disarmament efforts, \r\nparticularly towards achieving a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. ASEAN will continue its engagement with \r\nnuclear-weapon States in accordance with the \r\nobjectives and principles of the Treaty on the Southeast \r\nAsia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone and the ASEAN \r\nCharter, particularly with regard to their signing of the \r\nProtocol to the Treaty without reservations and as early \r\nas possible. We also encourage further cooperation in \r\nline with the ASEAN Plan of Action to Strengthen the \r\nImplementation of the Treaty on the Southeast Asia \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (2013-2017).\r\nIn addition, various seminars and workshops were \r\nalso held in cooperation with the United Nations, in \r\nparticular on conflict prevention, preventive diplomacy \r\nand counter-terrorism.\r\nOn disaster-management and humanitarian \r\nassistance efforts, ASEAN established landmark \r\ncooperation among the defence forces of the ASEAN \r\nDefence Ministers Meeting-Plus (ADMM-Plus) \r\ncountries. This is to enhance confidence-building, \r\nregional capacity and coordination through the ADMM-\r\nPlus Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief and \r\nMilitary Medicine Exercise, held in Brunei Darussalam \r\nfrom 16 to 20 June this year. That large-scale exercise, \r\ninvolving more than 3,000 personnel, enhanced practical \r\ncooperation in the area of humanitarian assistance and \r\ndisaster relief and built trust and confidence among the \r\nADMM-Plus militaries.\r\n8/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nhave seen several manifestations of this menace. The \r\ninternational community has long acknowledged the \r\never-present and pervasive threat posed by terrorism. \r\nNo country, city or region is immune from this global \r\nscourge.\r\nYet, regrettably, we have failed ourselves by \r\ncontinuing to procrastinate on concluding the \r\ncomprehensive convention against international \r\nterrorism. It is time that Member States summoned the \r\nnecessary political will to agree to the comprehensive \r\nconvention against international terrorism as a sound \r\nlegal framework for the fight against terrorism. We \r\nneed concerted global action. Such action should be \r\npredicated on zero tolerance towards terrorism and \r\naimed at systematically dismantling the infrastructure \r\nof terrorism.\r\nIndia has had a proud association with United \r\nNations peacekeeping since its very inception. \r\nMore than 150,000 of our uniformed personnel have \r\nparticipated in this f lagship endeavour of the United \r\nNations. As peacekeeping moves forward, we must \r\nremain mindful of the challenges of operating in \r\nincreasingly complex environments. Not only should \r\nthe mandates be realistic, but their framing should be \r\ninclusive of all stakeholders in a meaningful manner. \r\nAmbitious mandates require matching resources. We \r\nalso need to be mindful of the safety of peacekeepers \r\nwhile crafting such mandates.\r\nIt is also imperative that those who threaten \r\nand attack United Nations peacekeepers be held \r\naccountable. Cases where United Nations peacekeepers \r\nhave laid down their lives due to attacks by militias \r\nand non-State actors must be thoroughly investigated \r\nand the perpetrators of such acts brought to justice \r\nexpeditiously.\r\nWe note with appreciation the initiatives to \r\nmodernize and reform the Secretariat, including \r\nthrough large-scale business transformation projects \r\nsuch as the new enterprise resource planning system, \r\nUmoja, International Public Sector Accounting \r\nStandards, managed mobility of Secretariat staff, \r\nand the capital master plan. While each involves \r\nconsiderable investment, we see them as important \r\ndrivers in modernizing the United Nations.\r\nHowever, it is our deep-rooted conviction that the \r\nrelevance of the United Nations ultimately hinges on a \r\nmore fundamental reform of its governance architecture, \r\nwhich is frozen in another era that perpetuates the rights \r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his annual report \r\non the work of the Organization. It covers a wide \r\nspectrum of issues and provides information on the \r\nactivities of the United Nations. It also underscores \r\nthe global and interconnected nature of the challenges \r\nwe face and highlights the unfinished agenda of \r\ndevelopment and reform. It is important that the \r\nsociopolitical challenges in the West Asian region be \r\naddressed in an inclusive and peaceful manner.\r\nWith fewer than 850 days remaining for their \r\nfulfilment, we need to accord the highest priority to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Substantial progress has been made \r\nin reducing poverty, yet our gains and progress have \r\nbeen uneven and short on expectations. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report points out that almost 1 billion people \r\nwill still live in extreme poverty in 2015. The eradication \r\nof poverty therefore must remain the core, overarching \r\nobjective of the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nincluding under the sustainable development goals. The \r\nquest for sustainability will ring hollow as long as deep \r\nimbalances in the consumption of natural resources and \r\ncarbon-intensive lifestyles in the developed world exist. \r\nThe fact still remains that the richest billion people \r\nconsume two thirds of the Earth’s resources whereas \r\nthe bottom billion consume a meagre 1 per cent.\r\nOn climate change, India remains fully committed \r\nto crafting an ambitious, balanced and comprehensive \r\noutcome to negotiations in accordance with the principles \r\nand provisions of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. As we embark on the \r\nprocess of framing sustainable development goals, \r\ncrucial issues such as that of resource mobilization, be \r\nit official development assistance, technology transfer, \r\ntrade or foreign direct investment, must find appropriate \r\npriority and be enshrined in the principles of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities and equity. Insofar \r\nas our development partnership initiatives go, we are \r\nresolved to carry forward and expand our multifaceted \r\nand vibrant cooperation with Africa, including through \r\nthe framework of the India-Africa Forum Summit.\r\nSimilarly, we will continue to build on our \r\ncommitments for enhanced cooperation with the \r\nleast developed countries, the landlocked developing \r\ncountries and the small island developing States within \r\nthe overall rubric of South-South cooperation.\r\nTerrorism remains a grave threat to security and \r\nstability everywhere and extracts a heavy toll of innocent \r\nlives throughout the world. From Africa to Asia we \r\n13-50522 9/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\npreventable diseases. Fifty-seven million children are \r\nnot in school, and 73 million young people are out of \r\nwork. Therefore we need more concrete action.\r\nI commend the Secretary-General for his important \r\ninitiatives, including the launch of the Global Education \r\nFirst Initiative, which secured more than $1.5 billion in \r\ncommitments.\r\nMongolia makes every effort to contribute to \r\ninternational endeavours aimed at achieving the \r\nMDGs. Promoting literacy and education are among \r\nour priorities at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. As members are well aware, Mongolia initiated a \r\nUnited Nations Literacy Decade, which was successfully \r\nobserved from 2003 to 2012. It is gratifying to note \r\nthat the Decade was marked by steady progress, with \r\nmillions of young people and adults becoming literate. \r\nWhile national Governments were the prime movers \r\nin this regard, development partners played significant \r\nroles. In the positioning of literacy as a human right \r\nand a means to achieve sustainable development in \r\npoverty reduction, United Nations entities provided \r\nvarious forms of normative and operational support. \r\nI wish to commend them — in particular UNESCO, \r\nthe main coordinator and implementing agency for the \r\nDecade — for their dedication and continued effort.\r\nAnother initiative put forward by Mongolia at the \r\nUnited Nations became a General Assembly resolution \r\non education for democracy (resolution 67/18). The \r\nresolution recognizes that education is key to the \r\nstrengthening of democratic institutions, the realization \r\nof human rights and the achievement of all international \r\ndevelopment goals, including the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It invites Governments, agencies \r\nand organizations of the United Nations system and \r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nto intensify their efforts to promote education for \r\ndemocracy. I wish to take this opportunity to draw \r\nthe attention of Member States to the importance of \r\nimplementing that resolution, as we will be reviewing \r\nits implementation at the next session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nWhile accelerating our efforts towards achieving \r\nall the MDGs worldwide, we have started the process \r\nof defining the United Nations development agenda \r\nbeyond 2015. My delegation greatly appreciates the steps \r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General in this regard. We \r\nfully share the view that the report of the High-level \r\nPanel of Eminent Persons greatly contributes to the \r\nongoing process of consultations at various levels.\r\nof the “haves” of the mid-1940s. It is only through such \r\ngovernance reform that the United Nations can truly \r\ninvigorate action on issues of pressing global concern, \r\nbe it issues of peace and security, climate change, \r\ndevelopment, or human rights.\r\nLet me therefore conclude by raising an issue \r\nthat inexplicably does not find even a mention in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, and that is the important issue \r\nof Security Council reform, where intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have not made much progress in spite of a \r\nclear affirmation by an overwhelming majority of the \r\nMember States of the need for expansion in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories.\r\nWe need to build on this by immediately \r\ncommencing real negotiations based on a negotiating \r\ntext, as is the case in all United Nations processes. It is \r\nimperative to impart a sense of urgency and momentum \r\nto this process by pressing for a results-based timeline \r\nto achieve early reforms of the Security Council.\r\nThe year 2015, which marks the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations as well as 10 years \r\nsince the Millennium Summit Declaration, in which our \r\nHeads of State and Government mandated us to achieve \r\nearly reforms of the Security Council, will therefore \r\nbe an important occasion to deliver some concrete \r\nresults and an expanded Security Council ref lecting \r\ncontemporary realities.\r\nMr. Och (Mongolia): First, I wish to extend my \r\ndelegation’s deep appreciation to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his annual report on the work of the Organization. \r\nI believe that our discussions, based on a thorough \r\nreview and assessment of the work of the Organization, \r\nwill stimulate new thinking on how we can scale up \r\nour efforts in response to the many challenges that \r\nthe world community faces today, and in particular on \r\nways of accelerating progress towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and on the process of \r\ndefining the post-2015 development agenda. In this \r\nrespect, Mongolia welcomes the outcome document \r\nof the special event to follow up efforts made towards \r\nachieving the MDGs just adopted by the Assembly.\r\nAs the report states, the MDGs have improved \r\nthe lives of billions of people and helped to set global \r\nand national priorities and fuel action on the ground. \r\nHowever, the report also reveals that unless we take \r\nresolute action, almost 1 billion people will still live in \r\nextreme poverty in 2015. Mothers will die needlessly \r\nin childbirth and children will suffer and die from \r\n10/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nIn line with that thinking, we could look at the \r\npossibility of elaborating a United Nations convention \r\non water-resource management. That idea was expressed \r\nby the President of Mongolia during the proceedings \r\nof World Environment Day that our country hosted \r\nthis year. I hope that it will be given due consideration \r\nas we continue activities to observe this year as the \r\nInternational Year of Water Cooperation.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report testifies to the fact \r\nthat today the role of United Nations peacekeeping is \r\ngrowing rapidly. Mongolia has pursued an active policy \r\nin this regard, making its contribution to promoting \r\nthe noble goals of the United Nations Charter. During \r\nthe past decade more than 5,000 peacekeepers from \r\nMongolia have served in different peacekeeping \r\noperations, including the one in South Sudan. As a \r\nfollow-up to the visit of our President to South Sudan \r\nearlier this year, we are focusing our attention on issues \r\nof improving and strengthening our involvement in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nToday more than ever, we need concerted action to \r\nfurther strengthen international peace and security and \r\nto further promote our efforts on disarmament — nuclear \r\ndisarmament in particular. I should like to highlight \r\nin this respect the importance of last month’s High-\r\nlevel Meeting of the General Assembly on Nuclear \r\nDisarmament, which has given great impetus to \r\nglobal endeavours to eliminate those weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We hope that the Nuclear Security Summit \r\nto be held early next year in the Netherlands will also \r\nfurther facilitate global efforts aimed at nuclear safety \r\nand security. My delegation is of the view that nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones greatly contribute to hastening \r\nglobal and regional peace and security. To address \r\nother goals of nuclear disarmament, we encourage the \r\nestablishment of new zones in other regions, including \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nAs a North Asian country we are keenly interested \r\nin strengthening peace and stability in this region. \r\nWe believe that Mongolia’s proposal to start the \r\nUlaanbaatar dialogue on security in North-East Asia \r\nwould contribute to achieving this noble goal, and \r\nI wish to appeal to other countries of the region to \r\nconsider that proposal favourably.\r\nRecent days have been full of important meetings \r\nand events at the United Nations. I should like to draw \r\nattention to the fact that, during this year’s treaty \r\nevent, Mongolia signed two important agreements, \r\none of which was the Arms Trade Treaty — a historic \r\nWe believe that green and sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment should be adequately reflected in the \r\npost-2015 development agenda in order to address the \r\nwidely shared need to work towards one unified global \r\ndevelopment agenda with sustainable development at \r\nits centre.\r\nLike many others, Mongolia is extremely \r\nvulnerable to climate change. The country faces serious \r\nenvironmental problems such as desertification, \r\npasture degradation, natural disasters, droughts, water-\r\nand forest-resource depletion and air and soil pollution. \r\nThese issues have a negative impact on the livelihood, \r\nhealth and well-being of the nomadic herders and \r\nordinary Mongolians.\r\nIncreasing consumption, economic growth \r\nand the rapid growth of the mining sector are \r\nobviously intensifying the pressure on nature and the \r\nenvironment. Both sound policies and joint efforts are \r\nessential to solve this challenge. Continuing efforts are \r\nbeing made to address the environmental challenges \r\nby establishing and expanding the necessary legal \r\nframeworks, organizing various meetings, holding \r\nround-table discussions and implementing national \r\nprogrammes and projects. In 2011, the Parliament of \r\nMongolia adopted a law on reducing air pollution in the \r\ncapital city.\r\nFollowing the Parliament’s adoption of a package \r\nof laws on environmental protection at its 2012 spring \r\nsession, today 70 per cent of the country’s territory \r\ncomes under the special protection of the State. \r\nMore than 25 national programmes on nature and \r\nenvironment-related issues are being implemented in \r\nMongolia.\r\nIn 2010, the Government started the implementation \r\nof national programmes on water protection and \r\ncombating desertification. In 2011, the Parliament \r\nadopted a national programme on climate change. \r\nNevertheless, more effort will be required in the years \r\nto come. Mongolia fully endorses the recommendations \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and will be working towards their \r\nimplementation. One of the key messages that was \r\nsubmitted to the Conference was the need for an \r\nintegrated approach to water-resource management. \r\nThat message remains relevant and must be central \r\nin strategies towards a green economy. It was also \r\nstated that a regular reporting mechanism should be \r\nestablished for water-resource management that would \r\nassist progress and share information.\r\n13-50522 11/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nappreciates the hard work carried out by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and the Secretariat. To respond \r\neffectively to the multitude of security challenges and \r\nthreats, nations must work together to give a full and \r\nimportant role to the United Nations in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security.\r\nThe principles and purposes of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations are the bedrock of contemporary \r\ninternational relations and constitute a guarantee for \r\ninternational peace. The international community \r\nshould continue to adhere to the important principles \r\nof rejecting interference in the internal affairs of a \r\nnation, maintaining peace, opposing power politics and \r\naggression, and promoting equality.\r\nThe question of Syria is the focus of the international \r\ncommunity’s attention. In that connection, China \r\nwelcomes the decision adopted by the Organization \r\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2118 (2013). China is ready to send \r\nexperts to take part in the relevant work and to provide \r\nsupport.\r\nA political solution is the only way out on the \r\nquestion of Syria, and such a solution should proceed \r\nhand in hand with the destruction of Syria’s chemical \r\nweapons. China calls upon the Syrian parties to agree \r\nto an immediate ceasefire and the cessation of violence, \r\nand join the process for a political settlement of the \r\nquestion. China hopes that the international community \r\nwill build a consensus and promote the early convening \r\nof the second Geneva international conference, so \r\nas to end the crisis and start reconstruction through \r\ndialogue. We will continue to support Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and Joint Special Representative \r\nLakhdar Brahimi in their good offices. China is ready \r\nto join all other nations in a tireless effort to achieve a \r\ncomprehensive, proper and long-term settlement.\r\nCooperation for international development is at a \r\ncritical transitional stage. The United Nations should \r\ncontinue to play a leading role in development. China \r\nsupports the continued implementation of all of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the early start of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, with emphasis on the difficulties \r\nand challenges faced by developing countries, in \r\nparticular by African countries, least developed \r\ncountries and small island developing countries, so as \r\nto narrow the gap and rectify the imbalance between \r\nNorth and South.\r\nachievement of the United Nations in recent years in \r\nthe field of disarmament. In this way, we are trying to \r\nmake our modest contribution to achieving our common \r\ngoals.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my delegation’s \r\nstrong resolve to work together with other Member \r\nStates towards strengthening the United Nations system, \r\nso that it remains an effective centre for advancing the \r\ndevelopment agenda, a valuable tool for maintaining \r\npeace and stability throughout the world.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report submitted \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on the work of \r\nthe United Nations (A/68/1). At present, with the \r\ninternational situation undergoing profound and \r\ncomplex changes, peace and development remain the \r\ntheme of our time. In a multipolar world, economic \r\nglobalization and the emergence of the information \r\nsociety are profoundly transforming the world. Nations \r\nare more closely interconnected. Meanwhile, the \r\ninternational community is faced with a multitude of \r\nchallenges. The underlying consequences caused by the \r\ninternational financial crisis remain to be eliminated. \r\nThe instability and uncertainty of the world economic \r\nsituation are still remarkable. The full recovery of the \r\ninternational economy and its healthy growth still face \r\ngrave challenges.\r\nThe international security situation is complex \r\nand complicated. General hotspots f lare up from time \r\nto time. International terrorism, cybersecurity and \r\nvarious traditional and non-traditional security threats \r\nare interlinked. We still have a long way to go before we \r\ncan maintain international peace and security.\r\nOver the past year, faced with a multitude of \r\ncomplex threats and challenges, the United Nations \r\nhas been working actively to promote multilateral \r\ncooperation, with an emphasis on activities within its \r\nstrategic frameworks; has placed economic growth and \r\nsustainable development at its core; and has played an \r\nimportant role in the fields of promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment, maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, promoting African development, protecting \r\nhuman rights, coordinating humanitarian assistance, \r\ncombating terrorism, and promoting disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation.\r\nThe United Nations Secretariat has also made \r\npositive progress in improving its transparency, \r\nefficiency and effectiveness. The Chinese delegation \r\n12/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nOrganization. It will play an even more active part in \r\nthe work of the various United Nations bodies and will \r\npromote the United Nations, giving more attention to \r\nthe interests of developing countries in order to make a \r\ngreater contribution to building lasting peace, common \r\nprosperity, and global harmony.\r\nMr. Umemoto (Japan): First of all, I should like to \r\nbegin by congratulating His Excellency Mr. John Ashe \r\non his assumption of his duties as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. Japan \r\nlooks forward to his leadership during the current \r\nsession in facing the global challenges that the General \r\nAssembly is mandated to discuss, as outlined in the \r\nCharter, and reaffirms its commitment to contribute \r\nto his work. I should further like to convey to His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon the deep \r\nappreciation of Japan for his efforts in guiding the \r\ndiverse activities of the United Nations and for his \r\nlatest report on the work of the Organization (A/68/1).\r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nis a fundamental principle of the international \r\ncommunity enshrined in the United Nations Charter. \r\nMy Government is firmly committed to contribute to \r\nestablishing the rule of law at the international level \r\nthrough, inter alia, its support to international courts \r\nand tribunals, as well as at the national level through \r\nits assistance aimed at strengthening domestic legal \r\nsystems and human resources in developing countries. \r\nFurthermore, it is our strong belief that the idea of the \r\nrule of law is strongly connected with the enhancement \r\nof human rights, which is one of the three pillars of \r\nthe United Nations. Japan will continue actively to \r\ncontribute to international efforts under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nJapan strongly condemns the grave violations of \r\nhuman rights in places like Syria and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. We support the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations in that connection, which include \r\nthe decision of the Human Rights Council to extend the \r\nmandate of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria. Japan \r\nstrongly welcomed the Council’s adoption by consensus \r\nof the resolution on the situation of human rights in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, including \r\nthe establishment of the Commission of Inquiry on \r\nHuman Rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, and supports the activities of the Commission. \r\nJapan cooperated fully with the Commission when \r\nits members visited Japan in August as part of the \r\ninvestigation.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda should continue \r\nto take development as its theme and place the elimination \r\nof poverty and the promotion of development at its heart, \r\ntaking into full consideration the particular situation of \r\nnations and their different stages of development, and \r\nshould respect the path of development chosen by each \r\nnation independently. That agenda should contribute \r\nto the strengthening of international partnerships for \r\ndevelopment, adhere to the principles of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility and fairness, increase \r\ncapacity and development financing, promote the \r\nliberalization and facilitation of trade and investment, \r\nand expand official development assistance and \r\ntechnical support for developing countries, so as to \r\ncreate an enabling environment for the development \r\nof developing countries and provide a framework for \r\ninternational development cooperation conducive to \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMr. Ntwaagae (Botswana), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe United Nations is an irreplaceable platform \r\nfor maintaining peace, pursuing common development, \r\nincreasing cooperation and creating win-win situations. \r\nIt is also a community of nations that believe in solidarity \r\nand common progress. Faced with the challenges of \r\nglobalization and the changing world situation, the \r\ninternational community has greater expectations of \r\nthe United Nations. China will firmly promote the \r\ncontinued improvement of global governance and \r\nsupport the United Nations in its efforts to keep abreast \r\nof our times, respond actively to what is expected of the \r\nOrganization and better carry out the functions given \r\nto it by the Charter.\r\nUnited Nations reform should contribute to \r\nincreasing the voice of developing countries in \r\ninternational affairs and to a bigger role for the United \r\nNations in coordinating the efforts of nations to deal \r\nwith global threats and challenges. The reform should \r\nprogress in a balanced manner in the fields of security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights, and should contribute in \r\nparticular to positive results in the field of development.\r\nChina has always advocated, supported and \r\npractised multilateralism. China has supported granting \r\nthe United Nations a bigger role in international \r\naffairs and firmly upholds the status and authority \r\nof the United Nations. China will continue firmly \r\nto support the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations and is ready to deepen cooperation with the \r\n13-50522 13/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\norganizations and the donors. In addition, we also \r\nwelcome the initiative by the Secretary-General to \r\nstrengthen civilian capacities in post-conflict States, \r\nincluding through the launching of the CAPMATCH \r\ncapacity-matching programme last year, in which Japan \r\ntakes part.\r\nTurning to the situation in Syria, Japan profoundly \r\ndeplores the deaths of more than 100,000 innocent \r\npeople. Faced with the scourge of that war, the \r\ninternational community urgently needs to address \r\nthe appalling humanitarian conditions there. Japan \r\nwill continue proactively to provide humanitarian \r\nassistance to refugees and to neighbouring countries, \r\nnow totalling approximately $280 million, which \r\nincludes the additional $60 million pledged by Prime \r\nMinister Abe during the general debate,.\r\nChemical weapons must never be used again. \r\nJapan strongly urges the Government of Syria to \r\ncomply faithfully and fully with the chemical-weapons \r\nelimination programme established under Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2118 (2013). Japan will provide \r\nextensive support and the greatest possible cooperation \r\ntowards the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons.\r\nNow is the time for the international community \r\nto seize this window of opportunity with a view to \r\nbringing about a political solution. The successful \r\nconvening of the so-called Geneva II conference is of \r\nthe utmost importance in that regard. I should like to \r\nreiterate Japan’s commitment to working together with \r\nthe international community towards an early Syrian-\r\nled political transition.\r\nThe special event on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), held two weeks ago, was a great \r\nopportunity to renew our political commitment to \r\nthe achievement of the MDGs and to lay out a clear \r\nwork plan so as organically to integrate various related \r\nprocesses with a view to working towards a single \r\nframework and set of goals.\r\nOn the post-2015 development agenda, it is \r\nessential that human security be made its guiding \r\nprinciple. In that connection, let me stress two points: \r\nuniversal health coverage and disaster risk reduction. \r\nFirst, we should aim at satisfying broader health and \r\nmedical needs based on a people-centred approach \r\nthat seeks to attain universal health coverage and \r\nsupplement a disease-centred approach. Measures for \r\nvulnerable people, women in particular, are the key to \r\nrealizing universal health coverage. We will contribute \r\nJapan, along with the European Union, will again \r\nsubmit a draft resolution on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in \r\norder to address the international community’s grave \r\nconcern, including with regard to the abductions issue.\r\nAs Prime Minister Abe stated in his statement from \r\nthis rostrum during the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly (see A/68/PV.12), Japan has recently chosen \r\na policy promoting a proactive contribution to peace, \r\nwhich is based on the undeniable record and solid \r\nappraisal of our country, which has endeavoured to \r\nbring peace and prosperity to the world and emphasizes \r\ncooperation with the international community.\r\nThe world’s balance of power has been changing \r\nrapidly, and new types of threats have arisen because \r\nof technological innovations. It is now impossible for \r\nany one country, no matter which, to safeguard its own \r\npeace and security acting entirely by itself. Japan will \r\nwork to garner the trust of the world as a creator of \r\nadded value and a net contributor to regional and world \r\npeace and stability.\r\nGiven those circumstances, the role of the United \r\nNations will become even more important. The \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is \r\none of the primary tasks of the United Nations. In \r\nthat regard, Japan is fully committed to contributing \r\nto United Nations efforts by participating in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operation missions and extending \r\nassistance to affected areas.\r\nJapan is currently sending an engineering unit \r\nof approximately 330 people to the United Nations \r\nMission in the Republic of South Sudan. Japan is also \r\ndeploying two Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force \r\ndestroyers and two P-3C maritime patrol aircraft in the \r\nGulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia as part of \r\ninternational efforts to combat piracy.\r\nJapan welcomes the work undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations in the field of peacebuilding through \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and the Peacebuilding \r\nFund. We believe stronger emphasis must be placed on \r\nthe linkages between peacekeeping and development \r\noperations. Japan remains committed to ensuring \r\nthat peacebuilding dividends are felt on the ground \r\nthrough the work of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture.\r\nTo that end, Japan stresses the importance of \r\nfurther improving coordination between the relevant \r\n14/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nRepublic of Korea’s continued development of its \r\nnuclear and missile programmes is a serious threat to \r\nthe region and to the entire international community. \r\nJapan strongly urges the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to take concrete steps towards denuclearization \r\nand to fully comply with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and its commitments under the Joint \r\nStatement of the Six-Party Talks in 2005.\r\nWith regard to Iran, Japan continues to cooperate \r\nwith the Committee established pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1737 (2006). Japan strongly believes \r\nthat the full implementation of the related Security \r\nCouncil resolutions is of critical importance, as it \r\nprovides a solid basis for the United Nations to promote \r\ninternational peace and stability.\r\nThe establishment of the highest common standards \r\nfor regulating the international trade in conventional \r\narms had been eagerly anticipated. As one of the \r\noriginal seven co-authors of the Arms Trade Treaty \r\n(ATT), Japan did its utmost to finalize that work, which \r\nculminated in the adoption of the ATT during the sixty-\r\nseventh session. Japan strongly urges Member States \r\nto sign and ratify that Treaty at the earliest possible \r\nopportunity, so that the ATT will come into effect as \r\nsoon as possible.\r\nIt was regrettable that the Security Council failed \r\nto unite and act as one, before the recent adoption of \r\nCouncil resolution 2118 (2013), concerning the grave \r\nsituation in Syria. The malfunctioning of the Security \r\nCouncil reminds us that reform of the Council is long \r\noverdue and is one of the most urgent tasks to which \r\nMember States should give priority. Based on that \r\nbelief, the Foreign Ministers of the Group of Four met \r\nin the margins of the opening of the current session \r\nof the General Assembly. The Ministers reconfirmed \r\ntheir common vision for reform and stressed the need \r\nto intensify efforts to translate into concrete outcomes, \r\nat the latest by 2015, the commitment by the leaders at \r\nthe 2005 World Summit to work for an early reform of \r\nthe Security Council. In that context, Japan appreciates \r\nthe emphasis Ambassador Ashe put on the matter in his \r\ninaugural address. Japan also welcomes the invaluable \r\nefforts made by the Chairman of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, and supports \r\nhis proposal of a concise working document.\r\nRegarding administrative and budgetary issues, \r\nthe Assembly will be dealing with the budget for 2012-\r\n2013, as well as the 2014-2015 budget proposal. In order \r\nto ensure budgetary discipline, Japan will carefully \r\nto programmes related to universal health coverage \r\nthrough a multilateral approach.\r\nSecondly, disaster risk reduction should be \r\nmainstreamed in the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nsince a disaster can wipe out the hard-won achievements \r\nof years of development efforts in an instant. Having \r\nexperienced numerous massive disasters, including \r\nthe great East Japan earthquake and tsunami of 2011, \r\nwe would like to share with the world our experiences \r\nand lessons learned, as well as various new disaster \r\nreduction technologies and systems. With that in mind, \r\nwe will host the third United Nations World Conference \r\non Disaster Risk Reduction in the city of Sendai, the \r\ndisaster-stricken area of the great East Japan earthquake \r\nand tsunami, in March 2015. I should like to ask all \r\nMembers here for their cooperation in regard to that \r\nConference.\r\nIn September last year, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 66/290, on the common understanding \r\nof the notion of human security. That was an important \r\nmilestone for addressing widespread and cross-cutting \r\nchallenges to the survival, livelihood and dignity \r\nof people. In recognizing that development, human \r\nrights, and peace and security — the three pillars of \r\nthe United Nations — are interlinked and mutually \r\nreinforcing, Japan is determined to make further efforts \r\nto mainstream the concept of human security and build \r\non actions to implement that principle.\r\nDuring the general debate in September, Prime \r\nMinister Shinzo Abe declared his intention to create \r\na society in which women shine. Women, peace and \r\nsecurity forms one of three policy priorities of the \r\nJapanese Government. Japan is determined to redouble \r\nits efforts to promote the participation of women at \r\nall stages, including the prevention and resolution of \r\nconflicts and peacebuilding, as well as to safeguard \r\nthe rights and physical well-being of women who are \r\nexposed to danger in times of conflict. In that regard, \r\nwe will also further strengthen our support for the \r\nactivities of UN-Women and the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in \r\nConflict.\r\nThe threat posed by weapons of mass destruction \r\ncontinues to be one of the most imminent issues that the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States need to address. \r\nJapan has been playing a leading role in promoting \r\nthe adoption of General Assembly resolutions that call \r\nfor united action to achieve a world without nuclear \r\nweapons. In that connection, the Democratic People’s \r\n13-50522 15/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nand adopted a comprehensive framework for action. \r\nWith almost one billion people still living in extreme \r\npoverty and with income inequality rising, sustainable \r\ndevelopment will need to be inclusive and take special \r\ncare of the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable. \r\nThe support expressed by all Member States in coming \r\nup with a comprehensive post-2015 development agenda \r\nhas been overwhelming. Member States should build on \r\nthat momentum and find the best possible development \r\nframework for every one of us.\r\nMalaysia is following closely the progress of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals as mandated by the outcome document of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, \r\nannex). In formulating the sustainable development \r\ngoals (SDGs), we should keep in mind the interests of \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the least developed \r\ncountries. It is not intended that the developing countries \r\nshould undertake the SDGs as a kind of conditionality \r\nor a set of new obligations that apply only to them. The \r\ngoals should be universally applicable to all countries, \r\nincluding developed ones. Hence, the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibility enshrined \r\nin the Rio principles must be applied in a holistic way \r\nwhen formulating the goals. We should also ensure that \r\nthe SDG process is coherent with the post-2015 United \r\nNations development agenda process. The design, \r\nstructure and choice of SDGs should go in tandem with \r\nwhat developing countries aspire to achieve and should \r\nbe supported by our partners in the developed countries \r\nthrough the provision of technology and finance.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that the SDGs should not \r\nin any way undermine the achievements of the MDGs \r\nby 2015. We believe that MDGs and SDGs are not \r\ncompeting concepts. The SDGs, if correctly formulated, \r\nwould accelerate the continuation of work begun \r\nunder the banner of the MDGs. They should strive for \r\ngreater economic and social inclusion and emphasize \r\nintegration and balance among economic, social and \r\nenvironmental aspirations. There should be, therefore, \r\na unified, people-centred development with sustainable \r\ndevelopment at its core and under the umbrella of world \r\npeace.\r\nEconomic growth and social development can \r\nonly f lourish under conditions of peace, security and \r\nstability. Unfortunately, the international community \r\ncontinues to witness the devastating effects of conflict \r\nand instability on the civilian populations of various \r\nanalyse and judge the appropriateness and affordability \r\nof all potential additional items in the current budget, \r\nas well as the proposed programme budget 2014-2015.\r\nWith regard to human resources management, \r\nincluding the proposed mobility framework and the \r\ncommon system, those items have a great impact on the \r\nfuture of the Organization, and Japan will actively and \r\npositively participate in the related negotiations. Japan \r\nexpresses its appreciation of the Secretary-General’s \r\ncontinued strong commitment to better management of \r\nthe Secretariat and United Nations facilities.\r\nI will close my statement today by reiterating \r\nJapan’s intention to work closely with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in ensuring a more effective and efficient \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): At the outset, I should \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/68/1). The report, which covers a wide \r\nrange of issues, testifies to the centrality and importance \r\nof the United Nations in addressing the myriad of \r\nchallenges that beset the international community. \r\nThe challenges are interconnected. While we try to \r\nisolate them in order to conjure up specific remedies, \r\nwe must keep in mind that they are interconnected \r\nin so many ways. Malaysia associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by Brunei Darussalam on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. Allow me also \r\nto present some of Malaysia’s views regarding a few of \r\nthe key issues highlighted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport.\r\nAs the 2015 deadline looms, Malaysia, together \r\nwith the rest of the international community, is making \r\nthe final push towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We wholeheartedly agree \r\nwith the Secretary-General that 2015 is not the finish \r\nline in our quest to ensure balanced and inclusive global \r\ndevelopment. Rather, we will begin another chapter as \r\nwe continue on our journey to build upon the successes \r\nof the MDGs and fill in the gaps where we have fallen \r\nshort.\r\nMalaysia is fully supportive of the theme of this \r\nyear’s session, “The post-2015 development agenda: \r\nsetting the stage”, which is both apt and timely. We \r\ntrust that the theme will provoke serious discussion on \r\nthe path forward towards international development.\r\nIn Rio de Janeiro last year, the global community \r\nreaffirmed its commitment to sustainable development \r\n16/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nOrganizational Committee. We fully support United \r\nNations efforts to pool all available and relevant \r\nresources with a view to assisting countries in their \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding, recovery, reconstruction \r\nand, eventually, development. To that end Malaysia \r\nstands ready to provide capacity-building assistance, \r\nsuch as through the Malaysian Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme, under which we have trained more than \r\n4,000 participants from 14 post-conflict countries to \r\ndate.\r\nMalaysia continues to support the strengthening \r\nof economic development and political governance \r\nin Africa. We commend the efforts made by the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development and its \r\npartners, including the United Nations, in guiding the \r\nsocioeconomic transformation of the region. Malaysia \r\nwill continue actively to engage and explore potential \r\npartnerships in the African region in forums such as \r\nthe Langkawi International Dialogue and the Global \r\nSmart Partnership Dialogue. Malaysia also has strong \r\ntrade, investment and capacity-building links with the \r\nAfrican continent and looks forward to enhancing those \r\nties further in the years to come.\r\nAs long as nuclear weapons remain in existence, \r\nour collective safety and well-being hangs in the \r\nbalance. I reiterate the call made by our Prime Minister \r\nhere on 26 September 2013 for a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld during the High-level Meeting on Nuclear \r\nDisarmament.\r\nAs pointed out in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, it is ironic that an issue as prominent and \r\ncritical as nuclear disarmament remains at an impasse \r\nin international negotiations in the Conference on \r\nDisarmament. The paralysis must be brought to an \r\nend, and we reiterate the proposals made by our \r\nPrime Minister for new perspectives to be taken into \r\naccount in the disarmament discourse, including the \r\nviews of academicians, intellectuals, think tanks and \r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nMalaysia views the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) as a \r\nsignificant milestone in international efforts to prevent, \r\ncombat and eradicate the illicit trade in conventional \r\narms. The Prime Minister of Malaysia signed the Treaty \r\non 26 September 2013, cementing our commitment to \r\nbinding international standards that would contribute \r\nto reducing armed conflict and the misuse of arms. We \r\ncall upon Member States to accede to and ratify the \r\nATT in order rapidly to bring the Treaty into force.\r\ncountries, including Syria, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Somalia and the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory. We must strive harder to find concrete \r\nsolutions to end violent conflicts and create the right \r\nenvironment for nation-building and peacebuilding \r\ninitiatives.\r\nMalaysia reiterates its call for a Syrian-led inclusive \r\npolitical process to resolve the situation in Syria. We \r\nare against unilateral action to resolve the conflict, \r\nand we support resolute efforts through transparent \r\ndialogue and mutual cooperation. We join our voices \r\nto those of the international community in condemning \r\nwithout reservation the use of chemical weapons and \r\ncall on all stakeholders to intensify their efforts to \r\nexplore all possible diplomatic options for peace under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations.\r\nMalaysia regrets that another year has passed \r\nwithout any resolution for the people of the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory. Day after day, month after month, \r\nyear after year, the people of Palestine continue to see \r\ntheir lands seized to make way for illegal settlements. \r\nThey continue to see their families, including their \r\nchildren, displaced and forced from their homes. \r\nThe plight of the people of Palestine must remain a \r\ntop priority, and we fervently hope that the recent \r\nresumption of direct talks heralds progress towards a \r\nviable Palestinian State based on the pre-1967 borders, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWe express our strong support for international \r\nmediation efforts in bringing about a just, lasting and \r\npeaceful solution between disputing parties. Malaysia is \r\na firm believer in resolving conflicts through peaceful \r\nmeans and has played a lead mediating role in resolving \r\nconflicts and disputes peacefully in our region.\r\nIn that connection, Malaysia believes that the \r\nprinciple of moderation is an important approach \r\nthat can be applied in mediation. The application \r\nof moderation can contribute towards bridging \r\ndifferences, facilitating dialogues and resolving \r\ndisputes, as well as towards sustainable development \r\nand stability. Moderation can also create harmonious \r\nrelations by calling for mutual respect, tolerance, \r\nunderstanding, dialogue, compromise and justice. We \r\nbelieve, therefore, that moderation can be a valuable \r\ntool in conflict resolution, national reconciliation, \r\npeacebuilding and power-sharing arrangements.\r\nMalaysia is also committed to the work of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission as a member of its \r\n13-50522 17/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nArgentina takes a positive view of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals as a tool for organizing and \r\npromoting national public policy that brings together \r\nefforts to pursue specific, clear and concrete ends. \r\nNational Governments have been the major protagonists \r\nin that progress, with the collaboration of the United \r\nNations system and with the input, although not always \r\nsufficient, provided by international cooperation.\r\nThe current debate on the post-2015 agenda is very \r\ntimely, since an international and multisectoral dialogue \r\nhas been triggered on various aspects that will, no \r\ndoubt, feed into the decisions to be taken in 2014-2015. \r\nBut that process should not distract our attention from \r\nthe pressing work that we must still complete in order \r\nto meet the Millennium Development Goals before the \r\n2015 deadline. Many countries are on course to achieve \r\nthem, but when we are talking about development and \r\nhuman rights, the task is unending and that we must \r\nsustain our efforts over time.\r\nArgentina has shown that with clear ambition and \r\nstrategies and inclusive development, major changes \r\ncan become reality. Eradicating poverty is, and must \r\ncontinue to be, our central objective, and we cannot \r\naccept any pretext to avoid adopting that as the main \r\nobjective for 2030. The level of poverty in Argentina \r\ndeclined by 87 per cent between 2003 and 2013, today \r\nstanding at 5.4 per cent. The time to permanently \r\neradicate extreme poverty is now. That will not be \r\npossible unless we reverse the current trend towards \r\nincreasing inequality in the world. Deep asymmetries \r\ncontinue to exist between the developed and developing \r\ncountries, asymmetries that the Economic Commission \r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean has described as \r\nstructural gaps that are linked to inequality.\r\nWe do not believe that there is a single pattern for \r\ndevelopment, either our own or for other people. We \r\ncannot ignore the differences in the responsibilities of \r\nthe various countries to work to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Each country’s economic, social and \r\nenvironmental obligations at the global level should \r\nbe seen as consistent with its level of development, \r\nits specific circumstances, and its different historical \r\nresponsibilities towards the degradation of the \r\nenvironment, which means that we must clearly \r\nrespect the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility.\r\nEach individual State should therefore work in a \r\nsystematic fashion to promote development, beginning \r\nMalaysia is encouraged by the Secretary-General’s \r\ncontinued commitment to ensuring that the United \r\nNations is able to deliver in spite of scarce resources. \r\nWe agree that staff members are assets and that their \r\ndevelopment would undeniably assist in preparing the \r\nOrganization to face the evolving challenges with which \r\nwe are confronted in this day and age. Enterprise risk \r\nmanagement, enterprise resource planning, also known \r\nas Umoja, and International Public Sector Accounting \r\nStandards are not mere words or abbreviations for us \r\nto remember. They are important administrative and \r\nmanagement projects that will enhance the management \r\nand efficiency of the Organization as a whole.\r\nMy delegation acknowledges that there are limited \r\nhuman, financial and material resources available to the \r\nOrganization because of the world economic situation. \r\nGiven those limitations and the ever-increasing \r\nmandate given to the United Nations, Member States \r\nwill continue to demand greater transparency and \r\naccountability. In that connection, Malaysia would \r\nlike to see the completion of the capital master plan \r\nboth on time and within budget. That is important, as \r\nthe capital master plan will enhance the coordination \r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations through \r\nmodernization in communications and improvements \r\nin the working environment for staff members.\r\nTo conclude, it is true that much has changed since \r\nthe United Nations was conceived. Despite the changes \r\nand problems that we face, Malaysia remains a firm \r\nbeliever in multilateralism and consistently subscribes \r\nto the centrality of the United Nations, which has \r\nenabled the evolution of rule-based interaction \r\namong States, thus creating a predictable and stable \r\ninternational order. We sincerely hope that this session \r\nof the General Assembly will allow all of us to move \r\nforward in a concerted effort to address the various \r\nproblems and challenges that are laid upon us. The \r\nAssembly can count on Malaysia’s firm commitment \r\nin that regard.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Republic of Argentina would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for the submission of his report on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/68/1). I should like \r\nto focus my statement on three matters to which the \r\nSecretary-General has devoted a major part of his report: \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the \r\npost-2015 agenda, Syria, and particular developments \r\nregarding peacekeeping operations.\r\n18/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nnecessarily becomes an obstacle to the resolution \r\nof the conflict.” (A/68/PV.7, p. 10)\r\nThe Organization has recently made tremendous \r\nefforts to deal with the humanitarian fallout of the \r\nSyrian conflict and the fallout in neighbouring \r\ncountries. But it is clear that no amount of assistance \r\nwill satisfy the growing needs of the people of Syria \r\nunless a negotiated outcome to the crisis is found. We \r\ntherefore agree with those who believe that the recent \r\nunity of the Council in dealing with the matter of \r\nchemical weapons and in addressing the humanitarian \r\nsituation may constitute the foundation for a political \r\nand negotiated solution for the crisis in Syria that \r\nrecognizes the legitimate aspirations and demands of \r\nthe Syrian people and lays the foundation for lasting \r\npeace through the early holding of a conference on \r\nSyria to implement the Geneva communiqué of 30 June \r\n2012 (S/2012/523, annex).\r\nOf course, war crimes, crimes against humanity \r\nand grave violations of human rights cannot go \r\nunpunished. The International Criminal Court has a \r\nrole to play there. We must again stress, as we have \r\ndone frequently, that the delivery of arms to the parties \r\nin the conflict must cease.\r\nTo conclude, I should like to talk about certain \r\ndevelopments that have occurred over the past year \r\nwith regard to peacekeeping operations. As a member \r\nof the Security Council, Argentina voted in favour \r\nof resolution 2098 (2013) regarding the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, based on the concern generated \r\nwithin the international community by the continuing \r\ndeterioration of the situation in that country and the \r\nneed to ensure the protection of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law and the rule of law, and \r\nthe end of impunity, particularly in the eastern area of \r\nthe country.\r\nArgentina voted in favour of the resolution, but \r\nsubsequently expressed its concern regarding the \r\nestablishment of the Force Intervention Brigade, \r\nand particularly its ability to use force in offensive \r\naction, even when such a decision, enabled under \r\nparagraph 9 of the resolution, was considered to be \r\nof an exceptional nature and would not constitute a \r\nprecedent. My country believes that such a use of force \r\nwould represent a conceptual change in the traditional \r\nconcept of peacekeeping operations.\r\nIn that regard, with respect to including the \r\ndimension of the imposition of peace within the \r\nby ensuring consistency between its macroeconomic \r\npolicies and its policies relating to the generation \r\nof decent work and social inclusion. The access of \r\ndeveloping countries to genuine funding resources, \r\nincluding official development assistance, varies. \r\nThey may be able to obtain increased funding from \r\nmultilateral and regional development banks or to \r\nimprove their access to markets for exports through \r\nagreements reached at the next Bali round, particularly \r\nin terms of agricultural products. They also differ in \r\ntheir ability to promote the development of human \r\nresources and adapt to climate change.\r\nThe commitments entered into should be broken \r\ndown into specific aims and objectives for all, and not \r\njust for the developing countries. The implementation \r\nof Millennium Development Goal 8, which reflects \r\nthe commitment of the international community to \r\nsupporting the development agenda, has not lived up to \r\nexpectations and that is, perhaps, due to the fact that it \r\nwas not clearly defined with clear and qualitative goals \r\nto be reached. That is a lesson we must bear in mind \r\nwhen we formulate the new post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations must \r\nstep up to the challenges that we have to tackle. We \r\nmust get to the substance of the discussion — how to \r\nmaintain and consolidate progress made through the \r\nMDGs; how to strengthen and complement them for \r\nthe new sustainable development agenda, not forgetting \r\nthat the task is to obtain results and not just to quantify \r\nthem; and how to fund the new agenda and ensure that \r\neach individual State, whatever its development status, \r\ncan take ownership of the agenda by adopting realistic \r\nachievable objectives.\r\nMoving on to the Syrian crisis, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report has revealed the shortcomings of the \r\ncollective security system laid down in the United \r\nNations Charter and has placed in jeopardy the very \r\ncredibility of the Organization. Specifically, a divided \r\nSecurity Council has failed in its obligation to comply \r\nwith the mandate conferred on it by the Charter. A few \r\ndays ago, the President of Argentina raised that matter, \r\nplacing it in the broader context of the need to reform \r\nthe Security Council by removing the right of veto. She \r\nsaid:\r\n“When dealing with conflict resolution and \r\nmanagement, if one party to the conflict, or an \r\ninterested party, has the right of veto, that right \r\n13-50522 19/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nThe Central African Republic merits priority \r\nattention on political questions. The report describes \r\nthe assistance given to 55 Member States in building \r\ndemocracy and holding elections. We commend the \r\nSecretary-General for that assistance, particularly \r\nto African countries. On 30 September, Cameroon \r\norganized municipal and legislative elections in a \r\nclimate of peace and calm, which was welcomed by \r\nnational and international observers, a sign of the \r\nsignificant progress in and maturity of our electoral \r\nprocess, patiently established and constantly being \r\nrefined by our Government with the assistance of \r\nbilateral and multilateral partners, including the United \r\nNations.\r\nWith respect to promoting sustained economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development, the report \r\nmentions the actions carried out by the United Nations \r\nto accelerate the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and to promote the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, as well as the well-being of all \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe also agree with the Secretary-General that \r\nclimate change is a major issue in our age and that the \r\ntime to act is now. The recurrence of natural disasters \r\nthroughout the world, with Hurricane Sandy as an \r\noverwhelming and devastating example, striking even \r\nthe United Nations basement, should prompt us to \r\nmake good decisions before it is too late, at any rate \r\nbefore we have to pay an even heavier price, materially, \r\nfinancially and in terms of human lives.\r\nThe contribution of countries such as Cameroon \r\nto sustainable socioeconomic progress throughout the \r\nworld resides, among other things, in an environmentally \r\nrational management of our forest area of 21 million \r\nhectares in the greater Congo basin, which is the \r\nsecond largest after the Amazon and a large reservoir \r\nfor the retention of carbon and other greenhouse gases. \r\nIt is an oxygenic lung aerating the world, home to rare \r\ntree species, rare and diverse f lora and fauna, and a \r\nbiodiversity that has multiple uses. If all of that wealth \r\nis going to be global, a partnership must allow those \r\nwho have such things to enjoy them in a legitimate \r\nmanner, to obtain a fair price for them, and to provide \r\noversight, maintenance, conservation and regeneration.\r\nRegarding development in Africa, which is a \r\ndefinite priority that is always underscored by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the report highlights the actions \r\nundertaken by the United Nations, in close cooperation \r\nconcept of peacekeeping, even when justified by the \r\ncircumstances, there should have been further broader \r\nconsultations with all countries that contribute troops to \r\nthe United Nations, not only with countries contributing \r\ntroops to the United Nations Organization Stabilization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That \r\nshould be done bearing in mind the new tasks that \r\nmight have to be undertaken and the impact that such a \r\ndecision might have on the entire peacekeeping system. \r\nThe principles of neutrality and impartiality inherent \r\nin peacekeeping missions are at stake here. My country \r\nsupports the peaceful settlement of disputes consistent \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and other bodies.\r\nAgain, I should like to restate Argentina’s readiness \r\nto contribute and continue to work with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in order to achieve a United Nations that is more \r\nefficient and better adapted to the new international \r\nrealities.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in French): \r\nWe read very attentively the Secretary-General’s \r\nannual report on the work of the Organization (A/68/1). \r\nStructurally, the report is organized around the three \r\nmajor priorities defined by the General Assembly in the \r\nstrategic framework for the biennium. Substantively, \r\nit provides copious information regarding what has \r\nbeen accomplished in the 12 months under review. We \r\nare grateful to the Secretary-General for all of that \r\ninformation, which clearly demonstrates the efforts that \r\nhe and his staff have made in discharging the weighty \r\nand delicate tasks given to them by the Member States.\r\nWe join the Secretary-General in expressing our \r\nemotional condolences to the families of the officials \r\nof the Organization who have lost their lives serving \r\nhumankind and the noble ideals and principles in the \r\nCharter.\r\nRegarding questions of international peace and \r\nsecurity, the report summarizes the activities carried out \r\nby the Organization in maintaining and building peace, \r\nin conflict prevention, and in mediation in a number \r\nof parts of the world. We agree with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that prevention, peacebuilding and mediation \r\nare the best ways to prevent conflict situations from \r\ndegenerating or becoming seriously bogged down. \r\nIn Africa particularly, we support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the efforts to resolve existing crises on our \r\ncontinent, but especially to build African capacities for \r\npeacekeeping on the continent and subregionally.\r\n20/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nshould have included in that paragraph of the report \r\ninformation regarding the dissemination and teaching \r\nof international law in a number of regions of the world.\r\nOn disarmament, the Secretary-General expresses, \r\namong other things and quite rightly, strong concern \r\nregarding the use of chemical weapons in Syria. \r\nCameroon is a party to the ban on such weapons and \r\ncan only say that they should not be used. We worked \r\nfor the recent adoption in The Hague of a resolution on \r\nthat question, which was then amplified by the Security \r\nCouncil’s adoption of resolution 2118 (2013), paving \r\nthe way for the destruction of the Syrian chemical \r\nweapons. Beyond the destruction of those weapons, \r\nCameroon supports the ongoing Russian-American \r\ninitiatives aimed at finding a peaceful political solution \r\nto the entire Syrian crisis. Our peace-loving country is \r\nworking for an Africa and a world that does not have \r\nchemical weapons.\r\nOn drug control, crime prevention and \r\ncombating international terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations, Cameroon notes with appreciation the \r\nactions undertaken by the United Nations, as stated \r\nin the report. I should like to emphasize that acts of \r\npiracy and armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea were \r\nthe subject of a summit of West African countries held \r\nin Cameroon in April. That meeting enabled us to adopt \r\nunanimous measures to combat such acts vigorously. \r\nIn fact, an interregional clearing house headquartered \r\nin Yaoundé was established. The United Nations and \r\nother bilateral and multilateral partners are called \r\nupon to provide assistance to the centre as needed. The \r\npartnership that the Secretary-General wholeheartedly \r\nseeks could find fertile ground for cooperation in the \r\ninterregional centre.\r\nFinally, on the strengthening of the Organization, \r\nthe report emphasizes the measures taken by the \r\nSecretary-General to increase the effectiveness of \r\nthe management of the United Nations. We need not \r\nreiterate that the Organization is the body that regulates \r\nour higher common interests, including peace, security, \r\nand the well-being of one and all as the most critical \r\nelements. The Organization tajes an integrated \r\napproach to management through its key instruments, \r\nincluding the strategic framework, the programme \r\nbudget and oversight, and the inspection, investigation \r\nand assessment mechanisms.\r\nThe Organization’s staff, as the Secretary-General \r\nhas affirmed, is its greatest asset. In the past few years, \r\nthe stability and predictability of all those factors have \r\nwith the African Union, for the development of Africa \r\nthrough its support to the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment. There is no need to reiterate that our \r\ncontinent has in the past few years reaffirmed its \r\nleadership in defining the future and the role that it \r\nwishes to have in the short, medium and long term in \r\nthe comity of nations and throughout the world.\r\nProgrammes and projects have been developed \r\nfor that purpose on the continent, subregionally and \r\nnationally, with follow-up measures, partnerships and \r\nstrategic assistance partnerships. We have requested \r\nsuch projects, and we support the concrete measures \r\nproposed in paragraph 44 of the report, which states \r\nthat everything has been done to ensure that the needs \r\nand priorities of Africa are given full attention as we \r\nthink about the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe monitoring mechanism mandated by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in its resolution 66/293 will allow us \r\nto summarize the implementation of the commitments \r\nmade for development in Africa. Resources for support \r\nare, of course, expected along those lines.\r\nOn the promotion and protection of human rights, \r\nthe report describes the actions taken and the progress \r\nmade and notes the shortcomings and disappointing \r\nresults in some cases. In an area so expansive and \r\ndiverse as human rights, we need to emphasize the need \r\nfor firm will on the part of States to move ahead in that \r\narea. Cameroon is deeply committed in that respect, as \r\ncan be seen by the progress made by our Government \r\non the ground with respect to political, economic and \r\nsocial rights in developing appropriate legislation \r\nfor children, women, the family, older persons and \r\npersons with disabilities, in our participation in \r\ninternational treaties and conventions and in presenting \r\nnational reports in those areas and following up on \r\nrecommendations made by the competent national and \r\ninternational bodies.\r\nWith respect to humanitarian assistance, the \r\nreport provides detailed information on the total \r\ncontributions received and their recipients. We \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for the efforts made, \r\nand we would encourage him to move ahead, ensuring \r\ngood coordination, speed and greater security for \r\nhumanitarian assistance operations.\r\nWith respect to the promotion of justice and \r\ninternational law, the report notes a number of activities \r\nconcerning the International Criminal Court, as well \r\nas specific international courts. The Secretary-General \r\n13-50522 21/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nissues with insightful suggestions and provided a good \r\nbasis for constructive intergovernmental deliberations \r\nahead. My delegation commends the report for its clear \r\narticulation of serious concern over such development \r\nissues as the Millennium Development goals (MDGs), \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda and sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, and how the most needy and most \r\nvulnerable of countries can be taken on board in our \r\nfuture development efforts.\r\nNepal has unflinching faith in the principles \r\nand purposes of the United Nations, believes in the \r\ncentrality of the Organization in all multilateral affairs, \r\nattaches great significance to each and every aspect \r\nof the work of the Organization, and takes seriously \r\neach and every point the Secretary-General makes \r\nin the report. In looking at what the Organization \r\ncan accomplish directly and as a catalyst for peace, \r\nsecurity, development and justice throughout the world, \r\nwe believe the United Nations has no alternative except \r\nto ensure a more robust and reformed Organization, for \r\nwhich my delegation will be working closely with all \r\nin future.\r\nNepal has been contributing to the work of \r\nthe Organization in different capacities, and most \r\nimportantly in the United Nations peacekeeping efforts \r\nthroughout the world, including in the most difficult \r\nof missions and at the shortest notice. I assure the \r\nSecretary-General of Nepal’s continued commitment to \r\nparticipating in United Nations peacekeeping efforts.\r\nIssues of sustained economic growth and \r\nsustainable development, including climate change \r\nand mountains, MDGs and other internationally \r\nagreed development goals, the development of the \r\nleast developed and landlocked developing countries, \r\ninternational peace and security, human rights and \r\nhumanitarian assistance, justice and the rule of law \r\nat the national and international levels, international \r\ncooperation to free the world from the arms race and \r\nweapons of mass destruction, drugs and terrorism are \r\nall very close to our heart. Nepal is supportive of the \r\nserious efforts being made to address the concerns and \r\naspirations of small island developing States.\r\nWe are aware that no matter how we may wish \r\nto move ahead, we have to deal head on with the \r\ncrucial issues of infrastructure development, capacity-\r\nbuilding in terms both of hardware and software, \r\nresource mobilization, official development assistance, \r\ntechnology transfer, trade, foreign direct investment, \r\nbeen sorely tested, owing to global financial difficulties \r\nthat have not spared the Organization. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has been constrained to do more with less. We \r\nhope that projects such as Umoja and the International \r\nPublic Sector Accounting Standards norms mentioned \r\nby the Secretary-General will, in keeping with the time \r\nframe and goals set by the General Assembly, result in \r\na long-lasting management culture, if the Organization \r\nis to survive in the information age of the twenty-first \r\ncentury, where it has to deal with actors that may be \r\nbetter equipped in those areas. Cameroon supports \r\nthe efforts of the Secretary-General to modernize the \r\nOrganization in the hope he will move forward in full \r\nconsultation with and giving careful consideration to \r\nthe views of all Member States.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal): First of all, on behalf of \r\nmy delegation and on my own behalf, I wish to extend \r\nsincere compliments to Ambassador John Ashe on \r\nassuming the presidency of the Assembly and to pledge \r\nour full support in the discharge of his important \r\nduties in that capacity. I look forward to celebrating his \r\nsuccess, which will indeed be a common victory for us \r\nall.\r\nI also wish to put on record our sincere thanks and \r\ncompliments to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nindustrious and successful stewardship of our complex \r\nOrganization.\r\nOur Organization represents the soul of human \r\nconscience, a monument to the united determination \r\nto make our planet a better place by all means and \r\nstandards, and a vehicle for translating into reality our \r\ncollective resolve to that end. The Secretary-General \r\nsymbolizes the pinnacle of integrity, dedication, \r\ncompetence, judgment and overall coordination and \r\nleadership in the functioning of the Organization. It is \r\nwith this fact in mind that my delegation welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, as contained in document \r\nA/68/1, as an excellent window into the progress of the \r\nOrganization over the past year in all areas of its core \r\nfunctions.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s comprehensive analysis \r\noutlining the complex context of peace, security and \r\ndevelopment needs, resource gaps and other parameters \r\nof peace in the contemporary world, and the conclusions \r\ndrawn therefrom, are pertinent and urgent, together \r\nwith the actions that Member States need to take in \r\nthe course of next year and beyond. On the whole, \r\nthe Secretary-General has highlighted major global \r\n22/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nthe national scheme of things for implementation and \r\nfollow-up.\r\nAny recurrence of the same experience in the case \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda would be most \r\nunfortunate. Parallel efforts to engage machineries \r\nand all stakeholders at the national level right from \r\nthe planning phase is important to forge a sense of \r\nparticipation, partnership, ownership, attachment and \r\ncommitment, which are all essential to ensuring that \r\nthe intended results are achieved, achieved in full and \r\nachieved together.\r\nI therefore humbly call on the presidency of the \r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General to schedule the \r\nmeetings and activities carefully and judiciously, \r\nensuring justice and balance among issues and countries, \r\nas well as across themes and regions. That will help to \r\nensure that all efforts at the national and international \r\nlevels will go in tandem right from the planning phase, \r\ntogether with crafting financing and other mechanisms, \r\nso that we will be able to deliver what may be agreed \r\nand to evaluate the results afterwards.\r\nWith that fervent call, I reiterate my delegation’s \r\nadmiration for the dedicated and dynamic leadership of \r\nthe Secretary-General, and especially for his personal, \r\nempathetic hopes for uplifting the downtrodden and \r\nneedy, and our full confidence in his work ahead. Nepal \r\nlooks forward to working with all Members to make the \r\nOrganization rise to the challenge posed by our world \r\nin the twenty-first century.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): We commend the \r\nSecretary-General for presenting a very comprehensive \r\nand substantive report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/68/1). We all know that this past year the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has worked hard to promote peace and security \r\naround the world, to shape our 2015 development \r\nagenda, to champion the cause of education for all, to \r\nmobilize the international community to deal with the \r\nchallenges of climate change, and to muster support for \r\nsustainable energy for all. With the support of Member \r\nStates, the Secretary-General and the Organization \r\non his watch have made impressive progress. What is \r\nmore, we all, because of our collective wisdom, seem \r\nto be moving in the right direction.\r\nThis past year, we also had the honour of receiving \r\nthe Secretary-General in Pakistan, where he held an \r\nin-depth dialogue with our leadership and focused \r\non issues of education, energy, disaster response and \r\npreparedness, counter-terrorism, and peace and security \r\nsustainable agriculture, tourism, international \r\nmigration and development, to which we must accord \r\npriority.\r\nThe MDGs have been the most successful \r\ndevelopment drive in the history of the United Nations. \r\nThe drive has brought the United Nations closer to \r\npeople in the countries of the South. At the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, our \r\nleaders agreed to build on the success of the MDGs and \r\nto develop universally applicable sustainable goals for \r\nthe future.\r\nAs we embark on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, now is the time to stand by that resolve in the \r\nfirm determination that we will not betray the bottom \r\nbillion people living in abject poverty on any other \r\ndevelopment pretext, and that we will place humanity \r\nat the centre of development. The exercise of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda should rise to the challenge \r\nof facilitating the transformational shifts that the world \r\nneeds.\r\nWhile my delegation understands full well the time \r\nconstraints facing us and the Organization, I find it \r\nimportant to issue a word of caution regarding the use \r\nof time between now and 2015.\r\nThe Secretary-General has outlined a plan for \r\nholding big events in 2013, 2014 and 2015 as part of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda exercise. It is important \r\nto ponder how that planning relates to the necessary, \r\nrelevant activities at national level. We have less than \r\n100 weeks to deliberate on all aspects of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda and to agree on a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment framework by September 2015. If we cut \r\nout weekends and holidays, that period will be shorter \r\nby one-third. While the job has to be full-time, given \r\nits long-term pertinence and urgency, it will be one of \r\nseveral responsibilities for most of the people supposed \r\nto work on it.\r\nThe resulting danger is threefold. The exercise may \r\nnot be able to be adequately informed of the voices of \r\nall; the agenda may not be able to encompass or avoid all \r\nthat it should; and the specific aspects of the outcome of \r\nthe whole exercise may not correspond to the specific \r\nneeds on the ground. More importantly, there may be \r\na disconnect between exercises at the global level and \r\nthose at the national level. We have numerous examples \r\nof agreeing on time-bound programmes of action — say \r\nfor five or 10 years — and spending the first half of \r\nthat period figuring out how it can all be integrated into \r\n13-50522 23/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nhelp of the countries of the Great Lakes region and the \r\nSouthern African Development Community, to bring \r\npeace and stability to the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. That is a work in progress.\r\nWe also support the Secretary-General’s efforts \r\nto pursue a comprehensive strategy for addressing the \r\nproblems of transnational crime, resource scarcity, \r\nterrorism and political instability in the Sahel.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2118 (2013) to secure control of chemical \r\nweapons in Syria and destroy them. We hope that \r\nthe consensus generated by the resolution will lead \r\nto agreements at the “Geneva II” conference so that \r\nSyria can move towards reconciliation and a transition \r\nacceptable to the Syrian people.\r\nWe hope that the resumed Middle East peace \r\nprocess will gain momentum and lead to lasting peace \r\nin the region and a viable Palestinian State.\r\nFor our part, we fully support the efforts to shape \r\na post-2015 development agenda. Our new Government \r\nhas taken steps to accelerate social and economic \r\ndevelopment, with a sharp focus on the revival of \r\nthe economy, investment, trade promotion, energy, \r\neducation, health, and disaster prevention. We are \r\nworking proactively for peace and stability in the region. \r\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif met Mr. Manmohan Singh \r\non the sidelines of the General Assembly last month \r\nand made serious overtures to resolve all outstanding \r\nissues, including the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nPakistan supports Afghanistan’s efforts to \r\ninitiate a peace process and to move towards national \r\nreconciliation and stability. The international \r\ncommunity should continue to help Afghanistan as it \r\nnegotiates political, security and economic transitions. \r\nIn the meantime, the United Nations should upgrade \r\nand fortify its strategy for the repatriation of the more \r\nthan 3 million Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan.\r\nThe Secretary-General has expressed disappointment \r\nover the lack of progress on the disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation agenda. I would say that some \r\nheadway has been made. The Arms Trade Treaty \r\nwas adopted last year. The Nuclear Security Summit \r\nprocess is moving apace. A successful nuclear security \r\nconference was held by the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency earlier this year, and a High-level Conference \r\non Nuclear Disarmament was hosted by the General \r\nAssembly last month.\r\nin the region. His visit to Pakistan was memorable \r\nbecause he celebrated our independence day with the \r\npeople of Pakistan.\r\nIf we look at the state of the world, we see five broad \r\ntrends. First, the world has still not fully recovered \r\nfrom the international financial crisis, and that has \r\na direct impact on the United Nations development \r\nagenda. Secondly, the social and economic development \r\nagenda in many developing countries remains anaemic. \r\nIt requires the convening power and support of the \r\nUnited Nations. Thirdly, climate change has become \r\na serious challenge for our globe’s increasingly fragile \r\necosystems. Fourthly, conflicts are raging throughout \r\nthe world, most of which we cannot resolve without the \r\nintercession and intervention of the United Nations. \r\nLast but not least, terrorism and other forms of \r\nasymmetric threats destabilize societies and pit faith \r\nagainst faith, nation against nation, and civilization \r\nagainst civilization.\r\nNot all is dark and dismal. There are many positive \r\ntrends. The Millennium Development Goals have \r\nmade progress, although we have to go some way to \r\nmeet them 100 per cent and that is what we ought to \r\nbe doing. The United Nations is now preparing for the \r\npost-2015 development agenda to evolve and implement \r\na development framework that deals with social, \r\neconomic and environmental challenges in a holistic \r\nand cohesive manner.\r\nThe sustainable development goals must set the \r\ngoal of the eradication of poverty by 2030. At the same \r\ntime, we have to find a balance between economy \r\nand ecology, and we have to ensure that developing \r\ncountries attain higher levels of economic growth and \r\ndevelopment. Our efforts will f lounder if we do not \r\nhave a strategy for financing for development. We need \r\nboth traditional and innovative means to bridge the \r\nresource gaps for our ambitious goals for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Let us strive to succeed in all these goals.\r\nThe agenda of the Security Council is dominated \r\nby African issues. The Security Council, the African \r\nUnion’s Peace and Security Council, and Africa’s \r\nsubregional organizations have been succeeding in the \r\nrecent past in resolving some of the most intractable \r\nissues in East, Central and Western Africa.\r\nDaunting challenges remain in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Mali. In this regard, we \r\napplaud the Secretary-General’s leadership in crafting \r\nthe Comprehensive Framework Agreement, with the \r\n24/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nWe are concerned by what we read in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report regarding a decline in official \r\ndevelopment assistance for the period 2011-2012. We \r\nhope that the developed countries will honour their \r\ncommitments.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report does not take into \r\naccount the concerns of the developing countries, \r\nin particular the implementation of the promises and \r\ncommitments already made, in particular on how to \r\nimplement the fact that developed countries provide \r\nfinancing, build capacity and transfer technologies \r\nto developing countries as part of international \r\nefforts to promote sustainable development because \r\nof their historic responsibility, climate change and \r\nenvironmental obstacles to development, and given \r\ntheir financial and technological resources, pursuant to \r\nprinciple 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and \r\nDevelopment, conerning common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility. We welcome more vigorous United \r\nNations efforts to assist African countries in \r\ndevelopment, in particular through the financing of \r\npeacebuilding programmes through the Peacebuilding \r\nFund and through cooperation with regional and \r\ninternational financial institutions.\r\nThe situations in Guinea-Bissau and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic require peacebuilding in line with \r\nan comprehensive perspective that takes account of the \r\nspecificities of each of the two countries rather than \r\none model and lessons learned from the past and from \r\nexperience with the six countries on the agenda of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.\r\nWith respect to peacebuilding under the Charter, \r\nEgypt welcomes the United Nations role in democratic \r\ntransformation, including in Egypt in line with its \r\nnational priorities. We express our concern regarding \r\nthe treatment of the situation in Egypt in the report’s \r\nchapter on international security and peacebuilding. \r\nOurs is an internal situation that does not threaten \r\ninternational peace and security. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has said that this is an Egyptian matter and \r\nthat it is the responsibility of Egyptians to resolve this \r\nissue for a better future.\r\nI reaffirm that the Government of Egypt is \r\ncommitted to implementing the road map within \r\nthe agreed timelines, to holding presidential and \r\nparliamentary elections by the deadline of May 2014, \r\nand to repudiating terrorism and violence. We accept \r\nthe principles of the rule of law, respect for human \r\nWe believe that the impasse in the disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation agenda can be broken if we address \r\nfour core issues — disarmament, the fissile material \r\ncut-off treaty, the prevention of an arms race in outer \r\nspace, and negative security assurances — and pursue \r\nthem simultaneously without establishing hierarchies. \r\nSimilarly, barriers to access to nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes should be removed. We should \r\nadhere to the cardinal principles of security for all, \r\nnon-selectivity and non-discrimination.\r\nOur position on a fissile material cut-off treaty \r\nis determined by our national security interests and \r\nthe objective of strategic stability in South Asia. We \r\nadvocate a strategic restraint regime comprising nuclear \r\nand missile restraint, conventional balance and conflict \r\nresolution. Pakistan fully qualifies to have access \r\nto nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and to \r\nbecome a member of export control regimes, including \r\nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group.\r\nSecurity Council reform needs to be pursued \r\ncarefully and skilfully. This is a momentous process. \r\nIts results cannot be achieved through shortcuts or \r\nprocedural moves and manoeuvres. Decisions in this \r\nregard must enjoy the support of all the Members of the \r\nOrganization. The reform should aggregate and reflect \r\nthe aspirations and interests of all, not the ambitions \r\nof a few. The Council’s reform should make it more \r\nrepresentative, democratic and equitable and its work \r\nmore effective, transparent and accountable.\r\nAs the Prime Minister of Pakistan told the \r\nAssembly last month (see A/68/PV.15), we should plan \r\nfor a dynamic future, and not entrench anachronistic, \r\nhistorical patterns and privileges. The Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group recommends such a viable \r\nintermediate solution. Let us not forget that it is our \r\ncollective responsibility to revitalize the Assembly \r\nso that it can play its rightful role for peace, stability, \r\nsustainable development and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. This is a new era. Let us \r\nnot hark back but look forward.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\ncongratulate the President upon his election and \r\ncommend the Secretary-General for his report on the \r\ndifferent activities of the Organization (A/68/1).\r\nDevelopment is an important source of financing \r\nand support for many developing countries. In spite \r\nof the importance that we attach to other sources of \r\nfinancing, there is no substitute for public financing. \r\n13-50522 25/26\r\n09/10/2013 A/68/PV.32\r\nWe cannot equate nuclear disarmament with any \r\nother issue. The Secretary-General has commented on \r\nthe illegal proliferation of small arms and light weapons. \r\nWe affirm that countries producing, accumulating, \r\nbenefiting from and exporting such weapons are the \r\nsource of that proliferation. Egypt reaffirms that the \r\nArms Trade Treaty must take into account the interests \r\nof exporting and importing countries and the right of \r\nStates to self-defence and to export weapons within \r\nlegal rules. We support the efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to strengthen the position of the Organization \r\nin this area.\r\nWe welcome the progress made in administration \r\nin the areas of International Public Sector Accounting \r\nStandards, Umoja and human-resource management. \r\nWe support the principle of mobility as long as financial \r\nresources are available. We do not want it to be promoted \r\nat the expense of the Organization’s other priorities, \r\nsuch as development. Egypt is ready to open dialogue \r\nwith the President and others for specific results at this \r\nsession as as to move forward in our actions for peace, \r\njustice and development.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nI have had a request from one delegation to speak \r\nin exercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Kim In Kyong (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): I am speaking in exercise of the right of \r\nreply regarding the Japanese delegation’s allegations \r\nconcerning the abductions issue and the Korean nuclear \r\nissue.\r\nFirst, on behalf of the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, I fully reject the \r\npreposterous allegation of the Japanese delegation \r\nregarding the abductions issue. As we have made clear \r\non several occasions, the issue of the abductions of \r\nJapanese was completely and cleanly resolved thanks \r\nto our sincere and genuine efforts to implement \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea-Japan \r\nPyongyang Declaration.\r\nrights and fundamental freedoms, democracy, equality \r\nand justice for all.\r\nRegarding justice and international law, Egypt \r\nrecognizes the importance of respecting the judgement \r\nof international law. We believe that peaceful means \r\nshould be used to settle disputes pursuant to international \r\nlaw, including the International Court of Justice, the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and \r\ninternational arbitration. We hope that the international \r\nhumanitarian summit will be prepared with an agenda \r\nthat will build national capacities in developing \r\ncountries so that they will be able to deal with their \r\ncrises and offer solutions that will promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment through their national institutions.\r\nAlthough the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\n(resolution 60/1) and other resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly support the responsibility to protect, the \r\ndefinition of that principle is still subject to different \r\ninterpretations among Member States out of fear that \r\nit will be used in a way that is contrary to the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. We therefore stress that there \r\nshould be no politicization or pretext for interfering in \r\nthe internal affairs of States.\r\nEgypt welcomes ongoing social activities to \r\npromote women’s rights, as highlighted in the report. \r\nWe would have hoped that the report would have \r\naddressed last year’s accomplishments, for example in \r\npreventing violence against women and violence during \r\nconflicts.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his work \r\nwith the Open-ended Working Group on Nuclear \r\nDisarmament, his efforts to promote a fissile material \r\nworking group, and for his disarmament efforts. We \r\nthank him for stressing the humanitarian aspect of \r\nnuclear disarmament. He has stated that the 2012 \r\nconference on the establishment of a Middle East zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction had been welcomed, but has not named the \r\nState responsible for quashing it.\r\nWe draw attention to our interest in seeing the \r\nconference convened on basis of the most recent \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), as noted \r\nby the Secretary-General and the three depositary \r\ncountries. We reaffirm that the universalization of \r\nthe NPT is the foundation of the international nuclear \r\ndisarmament system.\r\n26/26 13-50522\r\nA/68/PV.32 09/10/2013\r\nmoment, a strike group made up of United States \r\nships — including the large nuclear-powered carrier \r\nUSS George Washington with at least 100 nuclear bombs \r\naboard, many guided-missile destroyers, cruisers, \r\nsubmarines and escort warships — is engaging in a \r\nmilitary exercise.\r\nThat is why, in exercise of the right of reply to the \r\nallegation of the Japanese delegation on the abductions \r\nissue and the nuclear issue, I once again reject all \r\nallegations made by Japan.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization, as \r\ncontained in document A/68/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 111.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\nThe continued attempts of the Japanese delegation \r\nto raise the already resolved abductions issue are part \r\nof their entire hostile policy towards the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, which has persisted for half \r\na century and is aimed at hiding their past inhuman \r\ncrimes against the Korean people. Japan should \r\nsincerely atone for its past crimes against humanity, \r\nas unanimously demanded by the international \r\ncommunity, rather than play tricks with the abductions \r\nissue, which has already been resolved.\r\nSecondly, on the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula, we have already stated several times how \r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula originated. \r\nThe nuclear issue originated because of the United \r\nStates and its hostility towards the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. The United States has defined the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea as an enemy \r\nand seeks to eliminate our political system.\r\nMy country possesses a nuclear deterrent not \r\nbecause of ambitions but because it had to counter the \r\nthreat. It has already been reported that, at this very \r\n"
