"The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 73, 74 and 130\r\nReport of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Prosecution of Persons Responsible \r\nfor Genocide and Other Serious Violations of \r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed \r\nin the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan \r\nCitizens Responsible for Genocide and Other \r\nSuch Violations Committed in the Territory of \r\nNeighbouring States between 1 January and \r\n31 December 1994\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the \r\neighteenth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal (A/68/270)\r\nReport of the international Tribunal for the \r\nProsecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former \r\nYugoslavia since 1991\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the \r\ntwentieth annual report of the International \r\nTribunal (A/68/255)\r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for  \r\nCriminal Tribunals\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting the  \r\nfirst annual report of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals (A/68/219)\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Judge \r\nVagn Joensen, President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda.\r\nJudge Joensen (International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda): I would like to begin by extending my \r\nsincere congratulations to His Excellency Mr. John \r\nW. Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda on his election as \r\nPresident of the Assembly. I wish you, Sir, a successful \r\nperiod in office.\r\nThis is the second time that I address the General \r\nAssembly in my capacity as President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). It remains \r\nan immense honour for me to have this opportunity \r\nto speak to the members of the General Assembly, \r\nand it is my pleasure to present to the Assembly the \r\neighteenth annual report of the ICTR (A/68/270). I \r\nremain confident that there will be only two more \r\nannual reports delivered by the President of the ICTR \r\nafter the present one, as we have once again continued \r\nto make significant progress towards the completion \r\nof our mandate and the transition to the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\r\nDuring the reporting period, from 1 July 2012 to \r\n30 June 2013, the Tribunal issued its last judgement \r\nconcerning one person at the trial level. As expected, \r\nthe notice of appeal from the final ICTR trial judgement, \r\nin the Ngirabatware case, has been filed with and \r\nwill be handled by the Mechanism, making it the first \r\nappeal against a judgement in a case before the ICTR \r\nor the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia to be handled by the Mechanism. With this, \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.33\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n33rd plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 14 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

At the time of her resignation, \r\nJudge Vaz was sitting on 10 appeals cases, and \r\naccordingly her departure put additional pressure on an \r\nalready strained Appeals Chamber. In order to mitigate \r\nany detrimental effect on the completion of appeals \r\nwork that would come with the loss of such an esteemed \r\nand hard-working judge, I requested that, in accordance \r\nwith article 12 bis of the statute of the Tribunal, the \r\nSecretary-General appoint a replacement judge to \r\nserve the remainder of Judge Vaz’s term. I am pleased \r\nto report that the Secretary-General has appointed \r\nMr. Mandiaye Niang of Senegal as a permanent judge \r\nof the ICTR to replace Judge Vaz. That appointment is \r\nmost welcome, and we are confident that Judge Niang’s \r\nprevious Tribunal experience will play a crucial role in \r\nhis ability to contribute to the remaining appeals work \r\nwithout delay.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Secretary-General \r\nalso took action to appoint a new Registrar of the ICTR, \r\nreplacing Mr. Adama Dieng, who left the ICTR in 2012 \r\nto become the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\non the Prevention of Genocide. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate the new Registrar of the \r\nICTR, Mr. Bongani Majola, whose appointment took \r\neffect from 1 January 2013. I must praise Mr. Majola \r\nfor the extreme dedication he has shown in his role of \r\nrepresenting the Secretary-General at the Tribunal at \r\nthis difficult time in our mandate, and I thank him for \r\nall the hard work that he has undertaken in the short \r\ntime since he took office.\r\nI would also like to express my sincere gratitude \r\nto the Office of the Registrar, as well as to the Offices \r\nof the Mechanism President and Registrar, for the \r\nexcellent cooperation that exists between our offices, \r\nwhich has led to the continued smooth transition of \r\nfunctions from the ICTR to the Mechanism.\r\nI would next like to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the entire staff of the ICTR, as the significant \r\nprogress we have made towards the completion of our \r\nmandate and transition to the Mechanism would not \r\nhave been possible without their tireless efforts. I want \r\nalso to thank in particular the Registry for the important \r\nachievements registered through its organization and \r\noversight of the preparation of records for archiving \r\nand handover to the Mechanism. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to inform the Assembly that last month the ICTR \r\nthe Tribunal has now completed its work at the trial \r\nlevel with respect to all of the 93 accused. That includes \r\n55 first-instance judgements involving 75 accused, the \r\ntransfer of the files of the three top-level fugitives to the \r\nMechanism for trial, 10 referrals of accused in custody \r\nand fugitives to national jurisdictions, two withdrawn \r\nindictments and three indictees who died prior to or in \r\nthe course of the trial.\r\nI turn now to appeals. During the reporting period, \r\nthe Appeals Chamber rendered judgements in the \r\nGatete, Mugenzi and Mugiraneza cases, in line with \r\nprojections. To date, the appellate proceedings have \r\nbeen concluded in respect of 46 persons, with the final \r\nsix appeals, involving 15 persons, currently pending. \r\nThe remaining appeals work is on schedule for \r\ncompletion before the end of 2014 with the exception of \r\none case, Butare, which involves six accused and which \r\nwill have its oral arguments in 2014, there remaining \r\nonly the deliberations and the judgement drafting to be \r\ncompleted in 2015.\r\nThe Registrar and I continue to oversee the \r\nadministrative functions of the Chambers’ monitoring \r\nof the Uwinkindi trial in Rwanda and will do so until the \r\nend of 2013, in close coordination with the Mechanism.\r\nDuring this reporting period, the Appeals \r\nChamber also rendered a final decision upholding the \r\nTrial Chamber’s referral of the Munyagishari case to \r\nRwanda. All responsibilities for the monitoring of the \r\nMunyagishari case in Rwanda have already become \r\nthe responsibility of the Mechanism, save for the fact \r\nthat the ICTR is still providing interim monitors from \r\nthe Registry, who are now working closely with the \r\nMechanism staff as interim monitors while monitoring \r\narrangements with an organization are finalized. The \r\nseamless transfer of the monitoring of referred cases \r\nis a prime example of the smooth transition under way.\r\nIn December 2012, the Security Council adopted \r\nresolution 2080 (2012), which extended the terms of \r\nthe ICTR Appeals Chamber judges to enable them to \r\ncomplete their work. I would like to extend my sincere \r\ngratitude both to the Council for that decision and to \r\nthe judges in the Appeals Chamber for continuing to \r\nwork tirelessly to complete the Tribunal’s work under \r\nextremely tight deadlines and making every effort to \r\nmeet the completion dates set forth in resolution 1966 \r\n(2010) while ensuring that the rights of the accused are \r\nnot compromised.\r\n13-51141 3/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\neven following recent Security Council resolutions \r\n2029 (2011), 2054 (2012) and 2080 (2012), in which the \r\nCouncil reiterates its call to Member States that are in a \r\nposition to do so to cooperate with the Tribunal.\r\nTowards that end, on 30 May 2013, the Tribunal \r\nsubmitted a strategic plan for the relocation of acquitted \r\nand released persons to the Security Council Informal \r\nWorking Group on International Tribunals. The plan \r\nprovides for an overall framework, in which sustainable \r\nefforts will be deployed by the Tribunal, and for strategic \r\noptions to be implemented on an ongoing basis. The \r\nRegistrar and I remain committed to undertaking all \r\npossible efforts to find a solution to this problem, and \r\nwe remain deeply concerned about the consequences \r\nof failure. In that respect, we have both redoubled our \r\nefforts in the past months, and I hereby reiterate the \r\nurgent call for increased cooperation from Member \r\nStates with respect to the Tribunal’s efforts to relocate \r\nthese persons.\r\nThe year 2014 will mark the passage of 20 years \r\nsince the genocide in Rwanda and the subsequent \r\ncreation of the Tribunal later that year. As we near \r\nthat important milestone, it seems like an appropriate \r\nmoment to consider again the impact that international \r\njudicial institutions have had, not only on the evolution \r\nof international criminal law but also on judicial \r\nprogress in domestic jurisdictions. In fact, one of the \r\nmore tangible impacts that the ICTR has had is evinced \r\nby the considerable steps taken by Rwanda to comply \r\nwith international fair-trial requirements for trials of \r\ncases referred by the ICTR and national jurisdictions. \r\nThose steps, which included the abolition of life \r\nimprisonment in isolation with respect to any case \r\ntransferred from another jurisdiction and the creation \r\nof a witness protection unit under the authority of the \r\nRwandan judiciary, demonstrate how international \r\njudicial institutions act as a guide in ever-increasing \r\ndomestic efforts with respect to international crimes. \r\nRwanda’s dedication to meeting international standards \r\nis one reason that it stands as an example, which is \r\nalready beginning to be followed by others.\r\nHowever, prosecution alone cannot maintain \r\npeace or achieve reconciliation. In that respect, we \r\nmust also emphasize the importance of the outreach \r\nefforts, including training programmes, professional \r\nworkshops, visiting professional programmes and \r\npartnerships with higher learning institutions, that \r\nthe Tribunal has instituted throughout its existence \r\nto ensure that affected communities, along with the \r\nhanded over to the Mechanism two temporary archives \r\nfacilities, which represent another important step in \r\nthe archives- and records-transfer process. I especially \r\nthank all of the archives staff from the Tribunals and \r\nthe Mechanism and commend them for the tireless \r\nwork they have carried out with distinction.\r\nI must also take this opportunity to commend \r\nthe ICTR and Mechanism Prosecutor, Mr. Hassan \r\nBubacar Jallow, for the tremendous efforts his Office \r\nhas made to complete the ongoing appeals, monitor \r\nthe cases referred to national jurisdictions and \r\nfacilitate the transfer of cases, archives and records \r\nto the Mechanism. The tracking, arrest and trial of \r\nthe three top-level fugitives — Félicien Kabuga, \r\nProtais Mpiranya and Augustin Bizimana — remain \r\nat the core of the Prosecutor’s work in his role in the \r\nMechanism, along with his continued assistance to the \r\nRwandan authorities in locating and apprehending the \r\nsix fugitives whose cases have been referred to Rwanda \r\nfor trial.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has also made \r\nsubstantial progress in the preparation of the \r\nProsecution’s evidentiary holding and records for \r\narchiving pending transfer to the Mechanism during \r\nthe reporting period. The transfer of the entirety of the \r\narchives of the Office of the Prosecutor is expected \r\nto be finished upon the completion of all appeals and \r\nrelated litigation before the Tribunal. The Office of the \r\nProsecutor has also been exemplary in its work on a \r\nnumber of projects that will be important in shaping \r\nthe legacy of the Tribunal. Finally, I would like to \r\ncongratulate the Prosecutor on the special achievement \r\naward that the Office received in September from \r\nthe International Association of Prosecutors for the \r\nsignificant and important work that the Prosecution \r\nhas done in its fight against impunity and for taking \r\nthe initiative to establish a manual of best practices on \r\nthe tracking and arrest of fugitives from international \r\ncriminal justice that can be used by national and \r\ninternational prosecutors around the world.\r\nI now return to an important issue that the ICTR \r\nhas continued to raise in both the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council for some years: that of relocating \r\nacquitted persons and those released after serving their \r\nsentences in the United Republic of Tanzania. The \r\nRegistrar and I continue to work closely, engaging in \r\nextensive diplomatic efforts towards relocation, but \r\nthis issue continues to be a daunting challenge, as there \r\nhave thus far been almost no positive developments, \r\n4/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\nof the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals. I congratulate you very warmly, \r\nMr. President, on your country’s assumption of the \r\npresidency and wish you the very best as you assume \r\nthe responsibilities that come with that role.\r\nToday, I am pleased to present both the twentieth \r\nannual report of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (A/68/255) and the first annual \r\nreport of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals (A/68/219), which is the successor \r\ninstitution to both the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). I would like to \r\nunderscore my gratitude to all the stakeholders who \r\nhave assisted with the work of the ICTY and the \r\nMechanism, including the very smooth transition \r\nprocess. That includes, of course, President Joensen \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), Prosecutor Brammertz of the ICTY, Prosecutor \r\nJallow of the Mechanism and Registrar Hocking, who \r\nis the Registrar of both the ICTY and the Mechanism.\r\nAllow me to begin with a brief overview of the \r\ncontinued work of the ICTY in the fulfilment of its \r\ncompletion strategy.\r\nSince my most recent annual report to the Assembly \r\n(see A/67/PV.24), the Tribunal has continued its focus \r\non completing proceedings as soon as possible, and \r\nit has rendered more judgements in the year ending \r\n1 August 2013 than in almost any previous reporting \r\nperiod. More specifically, the Tribunal rendered \r\nfive trial judgements, three judgements on appeal, a \r\njudgement on appeal from an acquittal pursuant to rule \r\n98 bis of the rules of procedure and evidence of the \r\ntribunal and four judgements in contempt cases.\r\nCurrently, the ICTY has four cases at trial and seven \r\ncases pending on appeal from judgement. I note that the \r\nAppeal Judges of the ICTY are also Appeal Judges of \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and \r\nin that capacity have an additional six cases presently \r\non appeal from judgement before them, as my dear \r\nfriend and colleague President Joensen informed the \r\nAssembly a few moments ago.\r\nWith respect to the ongoing ICTY trials, our \r\ncurrent estimates foresee two trials, in the Karadžić and \r\nHadžić cases, being completed in 2015 and one trial, in \r\nthe Mladić case, concluding in mid-2016. In the Šešelj \r\ncase, which was previously expected in October 2013, \r\nthe defendant filed an application for disqualification \r\ninternational community, understand the ramifications \r\nof the genocide and the lessons we have learned in our \r\nbattle against impunity.\r\nThe legacy that will be left behind by the ICTR \r\nis still being written. The ICTR legacy committee, \r\nin coordinating ICTR efforts and engaging in \r\ninter-Tribunal efforts, continues to work vigorously to \r\npreserve our records and ensure ease of access to them \r\nfor posterity. In that respect, the legacy committee is \r\ncurrently making arrangements to establish an ICTR \r\nlegacy website, which will provide access to an even \r\nlarger database of ICTR judicial decisions and case \r\nlaw as well as to the non-judicial legacy, including the \r\nspeeches and papers presented by Tribunal officials \r\nover the years. Furthermore, the legacy committee is \r\nin the process of planning events to commemorate the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the genocide in Rwanda and \r\nthe establishment of the Tribunal, to which we hope \r\nMember States will lend their support.\r\nIt remains my honour to address the Assembly. \r\nOnce more, on behalf of the entire Tribunal, I wish \r\nto express our gratitude for the support members’ \r\nGovernments have shown over the past 19 years. As \r\nwe complete the transition to the Mechanism and move \r\never closer to the completion of our mandate, I must \r\nonce more call upon the assistance of Member States \r\nto find practical solutions to the problems that I have \r\ndiscussed here today.\r\nI am humbled to be part of the rich legacy of the \r\nTribunal, and I remain ever encouraged by the direction \r\nthat international justice has taken in the two decades \r\nsince the inception of the ad hoc Tribunals. I have full \r\nconfidence that, through the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity and with the support of Member States, \r\nthe ICTR commitment to the sentiment that f lagrant \r\nviolations of international criminal and humanitarian \r\nlaw should never again go unpunished will continue \r\nto evolve in a meaningful way, leading to the eventual \r\nrealization of our goal: an end to impunity.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Judge \r\nTheodor Meron, President of the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nJudge Meron (International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia): It is an honour for me to \r\nappear before the General Assembly — and to do so \r\nunder the presidency of Antigua and Barbuda — in my \r\ndual capacity as President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and as President \r\n13-51141 5/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\nDespite those challenges, the other principals of the \r\nTribunal and I are focused on using all the tools at our \r\ndisposal to sustain the morale of the Tribunal’s staff. I \r\nremain, as ever, tremendously grateful that despite the \r\nmany challenges they face, staff members continue to \r\ncarry out their responsibilities with dedication and care, \r\nmaking it possible for the ICTY to fulfil the mandate \r\nwith which it has been entrusted.\r\nI would now like to turn to the progress of the \r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals, often referred to simply as the Mechanism.\r\nThe Mechanism began its work with the opening of \r\nthe Arusha branch on 1 July 2012, and reached another \r\nmilestone with the opening of The Hague branch on \r\n1 July 2013. The Mechanism now has a presence on two \r\ncontinents, including offices in the United Republic of \r\nTanzania and the Netherlands and a satellite office in \r\nthe Republic of Rwanda. Our small core group of staff \r\nincludes nationals of more than 30 countries.\r\nWith regard to judicial work, the Mechanism is \r\nseized of one appeal from an ICTR trial judgement \r\nin the Ngirabatware case. As already indicated, the \r\nMechanism will hear any appeals that may be filed \r\nin the four cases still in their trial phase at the ICTY. \r\nAdditional judicial matters — including requests to vary \r\nthe protective measures granted to certain witnesses, \r\nproceedings related to alleged contempt of court and \r\napplications for early release — have also come before \r\nthe Mechanism and have been addressed. I also note \r\nthat the Mechanism would conduct the trials of three \r\nof the nine individuals who have been indicted by the \r\nICTR but who, to this day, have not been arrested.\r\nIt was thanks to the dedication and cooperation \r\nof Member States that the ICTY was able to account \r\nfor all 161 of those individuals whom it indicted — an \r\nextraordinary achievement. It is vital for the cause of \r\ninternational justice that we ensure a similar result \r\nfor those indicted by the ICTR. I therefore call upon \r\nall Member States to take steps to ensure that the \r\nremaining fugitives — whether they are among the \r\nthree to be tried by the Mechanism or are one of the six \r\nindividuals whose cases have been referred to Rwanda \r\nfor trial — are at last arrested and brought to trial.\r\nIn addition, in accordance with the transitional \r\narrangements set out in annex II to Security Council \r\nresolution 1966 (2010), the responsibility for a number \r\nof essential functions has transitioned from the ICTR \r\nand the ICTY to the Mechanism. Those functions range \r\nof one of the judges in his trial. A panel of judges that \r\nwas appointed to consider the application upheld that \r\napplication by majority. Further decisions in that case \r\nare forthcoming, and I hope to provide more details in \r\nmy November report to the Security Council.\r\nAny appeals from judgement in the four trials \r\njust discussed will come under the jurisdiction of \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals rather than of the ICTY, in accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1966 (2010).\r\nTurning to the ICTY’s seven appeals, it is currently \r\nanticipated that appellate work on all but one case \r\nshould be completed by early 2015. Appeal judgements \r\nin the Ðorđević case and in the multi-accused Šainović \r\ncase are expected by the end of this year, and another \r\nfour appeal judgements are expected by early 2015. \r\nThe one remaining appeals case, that of Prlić et alia, \r\ninvolves six accused and is not forecast to be completed \r\nuntil mid-2017.\r\nAlthough the completion of the ICTY’s remaining \r\njudicial work and the ultimate closure of the Tribunal \r\nare still some time away, the Tribunal continues \r\nto take steps to effect the institution’s orderly and \r\nefficient closure. Among other measures, the Tribunal \r\nhas developed a consolidated, comprehensive plan \r\nto facilitate the completion strategy of the Tribunal \r\nand the transfer of relevant responsibilities to the \r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals. The guiding principle is that as judicial \r\nactivity is completed, staff will be downsized, facilities \r\nwill be released and physical assets disposed of. Those \r\nprogressive steps will ensure that the Tribunal’s closure \r\nis effected as quickly as possible while not impacting its \r\nsubstantive responsibilities or its ability to complete its \r\nmandate. Of course, all those steps will be undertaken \r\nwhile complying with the fundamental principles of \r\ndue process and fairness.\r\nStaff morale is inevitably affected in a downsizing \r\ninstitution, and the Tribunal, to my great regret, is \r\nno exception. I recall that the Tribunal’s modest past \r\nproposals for a retention bonus in the form of a small \r\ntermination indemnity have not met with success. That \r\nfact, together with the Tribunal’s ongoing downsizing \r\nand the knowledge that many of our talented staff \r\nmembers may not all be able to find comparable jobs \r\nupon leaving the Tribunal, make maintaining morale all \r\nthe more difficult.\r\n6/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\nBecause all that has been accomplished would not have \r\nbeen possible without the continued support of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, that is, in a very \r\nreal way, not just the legacy of the ICTY but the legacy \r\nof the international community as well.\r\nMs. Carayanides (Australia): I have the honour \r\ntoday to speak on behalf of Canada, New Zealand and \r\nAustralia (CANZ).\r\nCANZ reaffirms our strong support for the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and for the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\r\nMay 2013 marked the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe establishment of the ICTY, while the ICTR will \r\nreach that milestone next year. During that time, both \r\nTribunals have played a major role in the development \r\nof international criminal justice and have made a lasting \r\ncontribution to the international community’s goal of \r\nholding perpetrators of serious international crimes \r\nto account. The Tribunals have achieved that both \r\ndirectly, through their jurisprudence, and through their \r\nsignificant and ongoing contributions to the building of \r\nnational judicial capacities. Over that historic period, all \r\n161 persons indicted by the ICTY have been accounted \r\nfor. The ICTR has delivered its final trial judgement in \r\nrelation to all those indictees apprehended to date.\r\nThe Residual Mechanism opened its branch in The \r\nHague in July, following the opening of its Arusha \r\nbranch in July 2012. That ensures that key work relating \r\nto the trial of any captured fugitives, the enforcement \r\nof sentences, the protection of witnesses and the \r\nmaintenance of the Tribunals’ archives will continue \r\nbeyond the completion of the Tribunals’ mandates.\r\nWith those significant accomplishments, both \r\nTribunals are moving closer towards the completion \r\nof their mandates. However, they still have important \r\nwork ahead of them.\r\nThe trials of Goran Hadžić, Radovan Karadžić \r\nand Ratko Mladić continue before the ICTY. The trial \r\nand appeal phases of those three very significant trials \r\nrepresent an enormous amount of work. We commend \r\nthe ICTY on introducing measures to ensure that its \r\nprocesses are as efficient as possible, while respecting \r\nin full the rights of the defendants.\r\nThe ICTR efforts continue on the pressing matter \r\nof relocating acquitted and released persons. We \r\nfrom ensuring the protection and support of victims \r\nand witnesses to providing assistance to national \r\njurisdictions, and from enforcing the sentences of \r\nthose convicted by the two Tribunals to managing the \r\narchives of both the ICTR and the ICTY.\r\nIn carrying out those and other functions, and in \r\nestablishing itself as an institution more generally, the \r\nMechanism has benefited greatly not only from the \r\ndedication and efforts of its own staff, but also from \r\nthe talents and expertise of the many ICTR and ICTY \r\ncolleagues who, whether officially double-hatted or \r\nnot, have taken on extra work and new responsibilities \r\nin support of the Mechanism. I am tremendously \r\nappreciative of all that they have done and continue to \r\ndo.\r\nAs we move ahead into the second year of the \r\nMechanism’s operations, my colleagues and I will \r\ncontinue to seek to ensure that the Mechanism can \r\nserve as a model for international criminal justice and \r\nfor United Nations institutions generally, including by \r\nadopting best practices from both the ICTR and the \r\nICTY and then building and improving upon them. At the \r\nsame time, we remain ever mindful that the Mechanism \r\nwas created to be a temporary institution and that our \r\nresponsibilities will diminish over time. Even as we \r\nestablish our processes and systems and make decisions \r\nabout our infrastructure and staffing, therefore, we are \r\ncontinually focused of how to accomplish our mandate \r\nmost efficiently, while remaining as fair and effective \r\nas possible.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to note that earlier this \r\nyear the ICTY marked an important milestone: the \r\npassage of 20 years since the Tribunal’s establishment \r\nby Security Council resolution 827 (1993), on \r\n25 May 1993. In 1993 few were sure about how the \r\nTribunal would take shape or what it would be able to \r\naccomplish. Today, I am very happy to report that the \r\nideal embodied in resolution 827 (1993) — of the world \r\nin which accountability is the firm expectation, and not \r\nthe exception — has become a reality.\r\nEven as the ICTY moves to complete its remaining \r\nwork, we may rest assured that the Tribunal will \r\nleave behind it a world transformed, a world in \r\nwhich — thanks to the new Mechanism and to the \r\ncommitment and perseverance of members of the \r\ninternational community on matters of international \r\njustice — expectations of principled accountability \r\nfor those who stand accused of atrocities will remain \r\nthe norm, and the rule of law will continue to prevail. \r\n13-51141 7/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\nThose are significant achievements that move \r\nthe ad hoc Tribunals closer to their ultimate goal of \r\nmandate completion. We commend both Tribunals for \r\nhaving made substantial efforts in successfully dealing \r\nwith their caseloads despite various challenges. Trials \r\nand proceedings have been conducted under high \r\nstandards of rule of law, and valuable contributions \r\nto the development of international criminal law have \r\nbeen made. It is important to recall, however, that \r\nboth Tribunals are still functioning and are in need of \r\ncontinued support from the international community.\r\nThe remaining cases at the ICTY entail a substantial \r\nworkload for the Tribunal’s staff. Despite resolutions by \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly on the \r\nissue of staff retention at the Tribunal, staff shortages \r\nremain a serious challenge, and that is affecting the \r\npace of the Tribunal’s continuing trials and appeals. We \r\nwould also like to point to the ongoing work of ICTY \r\ninvestigators in locating mass graves in the region. \r\nThose efforts are crucial to ensure closure for survivors \r\nand families of victims and proper documentation of \r\nthe crimes committed.\r\nUnder the framework of the ICTR, three fugitives \r\nremain to be arrested and brought to the Residual \r\nMechanism. We strongly urge all States, and those of \r\nthe Great Lakes region in particular, to intensify their \r\nefforts to ensure the arrest of the remaining fugitives.\r\nThe Nordic countries wish to emphasize the \r\nimportant task of ensuring the successful transition of \r\ncases to national jurisdictions, both from the ICTY to \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia, and from \r\nthe ICTY to Rwanda. Such referrals help to strengthen \r\nthe capacity of those jurisdictions to prosecute \r\nviolations of international law and to reinforce the rule \r\nof law in the States concerned. It is also important to \r\ngive more attention to ensuring that victims receive \r\neffective reparation for their suffering.\r\nHaving a firm belief in the importance of justice \r\nfor ensuring lasting peace, we would like underline \r\nthe need for continued capacity-building and support \r\nto national jurisdictions both in the former Yugoslavia \r\nand in Rwanda.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) \r\nand its member States. The candidate countries the \r\ncommend the efforts that the ICTR has made to relocate \r\nthose individuals, including the development of a \r\nstrategic plan to address the issue, and we urge Member \r\nStates to provide the necessary support to the ICTR \r\nin that regard. We also urge Member States to ensure \r\nthat the nine fugitives indicted by the ICTR for their \r\ninvolvement in the 1994 genocide are apprehended and \r\nbrought to justice as soon as possible.\r\nThe ongoing support and cooperation of the \r\ninternational community for both Tribunals and the \r\nResidual Mechanism are essential to ensuring that \r\nthey are able to meet those challenges. We therefore \r\ncall on Member States to ensure that the Tribunals and \r\nthe Residual Mechanism are adequately staffed and \r\nresourced in order to achieve the goals set out in the \r\nSecurity Council resolutions that established them and, \r\nvery important, to ensure their lasting legacies.\r\nFor our part, Australia, New Zealand and Canada \r\nwill continue to offer full support and cooperation \r\nto the Tribunals and the Residual Mechanism to \r\ngive practical effect to our collective commitment to \r\ninternational criminal justice. In that regard, we thank \r\nJudge Joensen and Judge Meron for their important \r\nbriefings this morning and for their continued service \r\nto the achievement of the Tribunals’ goals. We are \r\nindebted to them both.\r\nMrs. Mǿrch Smith (Norway): I have the honour to \r\nmake this statement on behalf of the Nordic countries, \r\nnamely, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and my \r\nown country, Norway.\r\nAfter almost 20 years of effective operation as ad \r\nhoc international criminal tribunals, the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR) are now in the process of completing their \r\ntasks. At the ICTY, all 161 indicted persons have been \r\naccounted for. The ICTY has concluded proceedings \r\nagainst 136 of the 161 persons indicted, and there \r\nare no outstanding indictments for violations of core \r\nstatutory crimes. Similarly, the ICTR has completed \r\nall cases at the trial level and has made significant \r\nprogress at the appeals level. Several cases have been \r\nreferred for proceedings in Rwanda. The International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals has been \r\nestablished to finalize the remaining cases and judicial \r\ntasks of both Tribunals, with branches in Arusha and \r\nThe Hague, respectively.\r\n8/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\nstaff members. We note with satisfaction the efforts \r\nof the inter-State assistance mechanism, Justice Rapid \r\nResponse, in ensuring that the very valuable expertise \r\nand experience in international criminal justice of \r\ncurrent and former employees of both Tribunals \r\nremains at the disposal of all States and international \r\ncourts and tribunals.\r\nIn parallel, we encourage the Tribunals to continue \r\nto effectively prioritize their resources, while ensuring \r\nthat remaining trials and appeals remain on track.\r\nWe recall that States’ responsibility to cooperate \r\nwith the Tribunals and the Residual Mechanism remains \r\ncrucial for their ability to complete their mandate, in \r\nparticular in bringing those indicted to justice. With \r\nrespect to the ICTR, we recall that despite continuing \r\nappeals by the international community, nine accused \r\nindividuals remain at large. The failure to arrest \r\nthose indictees is a matter of grave concern. The EU \r\nand its member States note with appreciation that the \r\nProsecutor has intensified efforts to track the three most \r\nwanted fugitives and, in that regard, has sought support \r\nfrom regional organizations in Eastern and Southern \r\nAfrica. We also note that support from INTERPOL, \r\nMember States and other international organizations \r\nhas assisted in narrowing the search for those fugitives. \r\nWe praise the United States War Crimes Rewards \r\nProgramme, which constitutes a useful instrument for \r\nthe apprehension of indicted persons. We call upon \r\nall States concerned to intensify their efforts and \r\ncooperation with the Tribunal and the Arusha branch of \r\nthe Residual Mechanism in order to achieve the arrest \r\nand surrender of all remaining fugitives.\r\nWe note that in the ICTY report (A/68/270), the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor acknowledges the assistance \r\nit received from the European Union. We will continue \r\nto support the Office of the Prosecutor. We also note \r\nthat the States concerned remain committed to meeting \r\ntheir obligations towards justice, in particular towards \r\nthe ICTY and The Hague branch of the Residual \r\nMechanism.\r\nCompleting the process of rendering justice for \r\ncrimes committed during the conflicts in the former \r\nYugoslavia is essential for lasting reconciliation. \r\nFull cooperation with the ICTY therefore remains an \r\nessential condition for the Stabilization and Association \r\nProcess in the Western Balkans and is an essential \r\ncondition for membership of the EU. Croatia’s accession \r\nto the EU is an example in that regard.\r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro \r\nand Iceland; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Armenia, align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nreaffirm their unwavering support for the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY). We support the process of the \r\nestablishment of the International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals for both Tribunals, pursuant to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1966 (2010), in order to \r\npreserve their important achievements and legacy. We \r\ntherefore welcome the launch, on 1 July, of the ICTY \r\nbranch of the Residual Mechanism and acknowledge \r\nthe successful first year of functioning of the Arusha \r\nbranch.\r\nWe praise both Tribunals as well as both branches \r\nof the Mechanism for their achievements and invaluable \r\ncontributions to our shared goal of ending impunity \r\nfor serious international crimes. The European Union \r\nand its member States thank both President Meron and \r\nPresident Joensen for their reports and commend them \r\nfor their efforts in completing the work of the Tribunals. \r\nWe also pay special tribute to the work of all the staff of \r\nthe Tribunals and the Mechanism. It is important that \r\nboth Tribunals get the support necessary to complete \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nThe Tribunals have played a key role in strengthening \r\nthe rule of law and promoting long-term stability \r\nand reconciliation. Since their establishment, both \r\nTribunals have embodied the need to fight impunity, \r\nand the refusal by the international community to let the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern escape justice. They were forerunners in \r\ncreating jurisprudence that is a source of inspiration \r\nfor all national and international jurisdictions that are \r\naddressing and will have to address such crimes.\r\nBoth Tribunals have begun to hand over \r\nresponsibilities to the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals. We recall in that \r\nregard the importance of a smooth transition process in \r\norder for both branches of the Mechanism to carry on \r\nand protect the work of both Tribunals.\r\nWe note the challenges faced by both Tribunals in \r\nrelation to staff retention and the loss of experienced \r\n13-51141 9/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\nWe will continue to support both the principle \r\nand system of international criminal justice and its \r\nessential role in the reconciliation process, and we call \r\non all States to do the same. It is indeed important that \r\nthe knowledge gained and lessons learned in the fight \r\nagainst impunity are not forgotten.\r\nMr. Ahamed (India): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on assuming the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, and \r\nby reiterating my assurance of the full cooperation \r\nand support of the Indian delegation in the Assembly’s \r\nproceedings.\r\nI thank the Presidents of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nand the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals for their reports (A/68/270, A/68/255 and \r\nA/68/219) and put on record our appreciation for their \r\nwork. We commend the efforts of the two Prosecutors \r\nin undertaking outreach initiatives, including training, \r\naimed at strengthening the capacity of the national \r\nsystems to handle the referred cases effectively.\r\nWe are glad to note that both branches of the \r\nMechanism are now operational, with that of the \r\nICTR in Arusha commencing its functions on 1 July \r\n2012 and that of the ICTY in The Hague launched on \r\n1 July 2013. That should ensure a smooth transition in \r\nthe Tribunals’ pending work to the Mechanism. The \r\nSecurity Council’s establishment of the Mechanism, on \r\n22 December 2010, through resolution 1966 (2010), was \r\na key step in the two Tribunals’ completion strategies, \r\nas the Mechanism is mandated to perform a number \r\nof essential functions previously carried out by the \r\nTribunals, including securing the arrest, transfer and \r\nprosecution of the fugitives still at large.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that in the past year the \r\nArusha branch of the Mechanism conducted a number of \r\njudicial proceedings and performed functions ranging \r\nfrom protecting witnesses to responding to requests for \r\nassistance from national jurisdictions. We are confident \r\nthat the Mechanism will successfully build on the work \r\nof its predecessors in accordance with its mandate, and \r\nthus complete its pending judicial work in an efficient \r\nand timely manner, without compromising the right \r\nof any to a fair trial. The efforts to relocate persons \r\nacquitted by the Tribunals and those convicted who \r\nhave completed their sentences and been released are \r\nThe EU and its member States also call upon the \r\nGovernments concerned to pursue with greater vigour \r\ndomestic investigation and prosecution of war crimes. \r\nWe welcome the signing of the Protocol on Cooperation \r\nin Prosecution of Perpetrators of War Crimes, Crimes \r\nagainst Humanity and Genocide between the States \r\nconcerned in 2013. However, many challenges remain \r\nin coordinating the activities of judicial institutions in \r\nparts of the region. We therefore continue to urge all \r\nStates to cooperate with both Tribunals and branches \r\nof the Residual Mechanism, in full adherence to \r\ntheir obligations under the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions.\r\nIn recognition of strengthened domestic capacity, \r\nthe Security Council, in its resolutions 1503 (2003) and \r\n1534 (2004), calls on the ICTY and ICTR to transfer \r\nall lower- and mid-level accused to competent national \r\njurisdictions for trial by domestic courts.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing efforts of Rwanda, in \r\ncooperation with international donors, to strengthen \r\nthe Rwandan legal system and its ability to adjudicate \r\ncases from the ICTR. We confirm our commitment to \r\nsupport activities aimed at strengthening the capacity \r\nof the Rwandan judiciary. We note with appreciation \r\nthat the Prosecutor of the ICTR continues to focus on \r\nmonitoring the referral of cases to national jurisdictions \r\nin order to facilitate indictment, trial and judgement \r\nbefore the Rwandan High Court.\r\nWe welcome the work of the Tribunals on \r\nstrengthening the capacity of national authorities to \r\nhandle the remaining war crime cases effectively. We \r\nfully support the training and information exchanges \r\nas well as access to publicly available investigating \r\nmaterial and evidence from the Tribunals. That is \r\nimportant for the Tribunal’s legacy and for the domestic \r\ncapacity to adjudicate war crimes. In its Stabilization \r\nand Association Process for the Western Balkans, the \r\nEU is increasingly underlining the importance of local \r\nownership for handling war-crime cases in line with the \r\nneed to fight impunity.\r\nFinally, we welcome the steps taken by the Tribunals \r\nin terms of capacity-building, the dissemination of \r\ninformation and legacy. We recall the importance of \r\nthe preservation of archives in the transition process \r\nto the Mechanism, as they remain an integral part of \r\nthe history and the memory of both Rwanda and the \r\ncountries of the former Yugoslavia.\r\n10/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\nmessage that the crimes committed in the former \r\nYugoslavia should be punished consistently and \r\nwithout exceptions. The same can be said of the ICTR. \r\nThe latest annual reports show that the Tribunals have \r\nremained focused on the completion of all trials and \r\nappeals.\r\nWe commend the valuable assistance and \r\ncoordination of the Secretariat’s Office of Legal Affairs \r\nand the Security Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nInternational Tribunals in ensuring the smooth transition \r\nof the Tribunal’s functions to the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals. We welcome the \r\nfact that various measures have been taken to ensure \r\nthat the Tribunal operates as efficiently as possible \r\nwhile preserving a high level of procedural fairness. \r\nWe also acknowledge that significant efforts have been \r\nmade to coordinate activities with the Security Council \r\nso as to ensure that the Tribunal is assigned its full \r\ncomplement of judges, in order to address any potential \r\ndelays caused by the Appeals Chamber’s increased \r\nworkload.\r\nWe should underline that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s \r\nauthorities continue to respond promptly and adequately \r\nto most of the requests of the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nfor documents, as well as for access to Government \r\narchives. Our authorities also continue to provide \r\nvaluable assistance in witness-protection matters and in \r\nfacilitating witnesses’ appearances before the Tribunal.\r\nWe would like to reiterate that since the end of the \r\nwar, Bosnia and Herzegovina has cooperated constantly \r\nand constructively with the prosecution in The Hague \r\nand the Tribunal. Those cooperation efforts have been \r\npositively assessed in the periodic reports and are noted \r\nin the current annual report. We have taken note of all \r\nthe other concerns raised by the Prosecutor and are \r\nfully aware that a lot remains to be done.\r\nI wish to remind the Assembly that Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina bears the greatest burden of prosecutions \r\nfor war crimes. However, since 2005, when Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina’s court became fully operational, \r\nmeasurable progress has been made in prosecuting war \r\ncrimes, and more than 200 cases have been successfully \r\nconcluded. Nevertheless, according to the relevant \r\nstatistics of domestic and international stakeholders, a \r\nlarge number of war crimes remain to be prosecuted \r\nin the domestic courts. We are also aware of the fact \r\nthat the implementation of our national war crimes \r\nstrategy needs an improved approach if it is to meet the \r\ndeadlines the strategy has set. Stronger efforts must be \r\nsignificant in humanitarian terms and with regard to \r\nreconciliation and should be accorded priority.\r\nThe aim of the international community in setting \r\nup international criminal courts and tribunals was to \r\npunish the guilty and end impunity. However, trials \r\nthrough such courts do not always have the desired \r\nimpact on the affected communities in terms of healing \r\nand reconciliation. When such trials are conducted by \r\nforeign judicial systems or tribunals, with little or no \r\nconnection to the perpetrators, victims or offences, \r\nthey are invariably decoupled from the political, social \r\nand economic context of the affected country and its \r\npeople.\r\nWhile the Tribunals have played an important role \r\nin promoting accountability and ending impunity, it \r\nremains crucial to strengthen national judicial systems \r\nso that they may prosecute serious crimes, since \r\nStates have the primary responsibility for prosecuting \r\nsuch crimes committed on their territory or by their \r\nnationals. Therefore, creating effective national legal \r\nand judicial institutions that uphold the rule of law is \r\nessential, and it is imperative that the international \r\ncommunity continue to promote the strengthening \r\nof national criminal justice systems by building the \r\ncapacities of national investigative, prosecutorial and \r\njudicial agencies. In that regard, the ICTR’s referral \r\nof six cases to the Rwandan authorities for trial is \r\nsignificant.\r\nInternational criminal justice has also been \r\ncriticized for its selectivity. In order to ensure the \r\ncredibility of the system, selective and discriminatory \r\napproaches should be shunned and the role of political \r\norganizations minimized for consistent application of \r\nthe law.\r\nMs. Čolaković (Bosnia and Herzegovina): We would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for transmitting the \r\ntwentieth annual report of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) (A/68/255) \r\nand the eighteenth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) (A/68/270) to \r\nthe Security Council and to the General Assembly. We \r\nwould also like to thank the Tribunal staff for all their \r\nefforts and commitment to successfully completing \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nThe establishment of an ad hoc criminal tribunal \r\nfor the former Yugoslavia as a legal framework for \r\nensuring accountability and ending a tragic period for \r\nthose living in Bosnia and Herzegovina sent a clear \r\n13-51141 11/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\nto the Security Council (S/2013/308 and S/2013/310), \r\nthe situation in the Tribunals has not significantly \r\nchanged. The parameters for the ICTY’s timetable for \r\nthe completion of its work, established by Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1966 (2010), remain the same. We \r\nregret the fact that in this situation, the leadership of \r\nthe ICTY, despite opportunities, essentially rejected \r\nusing a technical decision to enable it to refer the Prlić \r\net al. case to the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals.\r\nWhat can be said in its favour is that the ICTY’s \r\nsituation has at least not deteriorated since the June \r\nreport to the Security Council. The same cannot be \r\nsaid of the Rwanda Tribunal, which, despite having \r\nthe necessary resources, confirmed the information \r\nin the report about delays in the Butare case that \r\nexceed the limits laid down in resolution 1966 (2010). \r\nUnfortunately, it appears that we will not be able to \r\navoid investigating this situation within the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nAt the same time, however, we should not neglect \r\nto mention the positive progress made in the work \r\nof the ICTY regarding its handling of anti-Serbian \r\naccusations. We refer to the recent decisions in the case \r\nof Stanišić and Simatović in Trial Chamber I and in the \r\ncase of Prosecutor v. Momčilo Perišić in the Appeals \r\nChamber.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to highlight the \r\nsignificant role played by the States of the two regions \r\ninvolved, as well as other States, through their support \r\nfor the Tribunals and the Residual Mechanism. In that \r\nconnection, we commend the high level of cooperation \r\nshown by Serbia with the ICTY and by Rwanda with \r\nthe ICTR.\r\nMr. Pope (United States of America): The United \r\nStates wishes to thank President Joensen of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nand President Meron of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for their \r\nreports. They have provided exemplary leadership in \r\nthe cause of international justice, and we salute their \r\nlong and distinguished careers as jurists and global \r\npublic servants.\r\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \r\ncreation of the ICTY. As we all recall, that Tribunal \r\nand, subsequently, the ICTR, were set up in response \r\nto the horrors committed in Rwanda and Yugoslavia in \r\nthe 1990s, when the slaughter of hundreds of thousands \r\nmade to effectively increase the pace of the overall case \r\nproceedings at both the State and entity levels.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAs the Tribunals steadily head towards their closure, \r\nthe duty of continuing the fight against impunity and \r\nenhancing the reach of justice remains with the credible \r\nnational prosecutors. To that end, our common goal \r\nremains the investigation and prosecution of all crimes \r\ncommitted and the appropriate punishment of the \r\nperpetrators. Regional cooperation plays an important \r\nrole in that regard. We are therefore certain that the \r\nprotocol on the exchange of evidence and information \r\non war crimes, signed between the prosecutors’ offices \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia, is \r\nserving as an impetus in strengthening communication \r\nand further enhancing coordination. We remain \r\ndedicated to further promoting and intensifying \r\nregional cooperation, considering that it is in the joint \r\ninterests of the countries of the region as well.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We would first like to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), Mr. Theodor Meron, on \r\nhis re-election to the post. We would like to hope that \r\nall the efforts expended on the elections will not be in \r\nvain, and that the ICTY, under Mr. Meron’s leadership, \r\nwill still be able to reach its final closure with results \r\nacceptable to all States.\r\nThe ICTY’s speedy closure, as we understand it, will \r\nbe facilitated by the forthcoming election of a sixteenth \r\njudge to be assigned to the Appeals Chamber of the two \r\nTribunals, a process that was launched at Mr. Meron’s \r\nrequest. The election has unexpectedly excited \r\nheightened interest among States. So many candidates \r\nhave been proposed that there would be problems listing \r\nthem all on the ballot. Fortunately, after the news of \r\nMr. Meron’s successful re-election reached New York, \r\nthe objections to our compromise version — which had \r\nnot been immediately supported — for presenting all \r\nsix candidates to the Assembly were removed. We await \r\nthe results of the voting in the General Assembly with \r\ninterest.\r\nWe thank the leaders of the ICTY and the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nfor their presentation of the annual reports on their \r\nactivities (A/68/255 and A/68/270). On the whole, \r\nregarding the information presented in the June reports \r\n12/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\ncommunity to help protect populations from mass \r\natrocities, through tribunals and all other institutions \r\nand initiatives at our disposal.\r\nMr. Rosenthal (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, Judge Meron, and \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda, Judge Joensen, for their comprehensive \r\nbriefings. Their briefings, along with the annual \r\nreports of the Tribunals before us (A/68/270 and \r\nA/68/255), reflect the achievements and tenacious \r\nefforts undertaken by both Tribunals to successfully \r\ncomplete their mandates.\r\nI would first of all like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our firm support for the International Tribunals, \r\nas well as for the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals. We urge Member States to maintain \r\ntheir support for all three institutions. The Tribunals \r\ndeserve a positive assessment on several counts.\r\nFirst, the Tribunals have fulfilled a dissuasive \r\nfunction by identifying and punishing those guilty of \r\nthe gravest crimes. But they have also had preventive \r\nfunction, inasmuch as the possibility of being tried \r\nserved to discourage others from committing new \r\ncrimes.\r\nSecondly, the Tribunals have served an emblematic \r\nfunction by reflecting a decisive step forward in the \r\ncommitment of the international community to ensure \r\nrespect for international humanitarian law, as by \r\nestablishing the fact that certain crimes are so serious \r\nthat they constitute an offence against humanity itself \r\nand should not go unpunished.\r\nThirdly, the Tribunals were the principal inspiration \r\nfor the establishment, in 1998, of the International \r\nCriminal Court, which has changed the parameters in \r\nthe search for peace based on the understanding that \r\nenduring peace requires justice. The Security Council \r\nhas also contributed to promoting accountability, peace \r\nand justice by addressing other situations through \r\ntribunals assisted by the United Nations, such as the \r\nSpecial Tribunal for Lebanon and the Special Court for \r\nSierra Leone.\r\nFourthly, the fact that justice has been delivered \r\nby an independent institution has contributed to the \r\nidentification and punishment of the guilty and to the \r\nclarification of the historical truth by exposing evidence \r\nof the crimes committed. Knowledge of the facts and \r\nled to a wave of international revulsion and cries for \r\njustice. The ICTR and ICTY were founded on the idea \r\nthat those responsible for mass atrocities, no matter \r\nwhat their rank or official position, must be brought \r\nto justice. Once they were fully up and running, the \r\nTribunals began thoroughly addressing serious issues \r\nof international justice.\r\nTo date, the two courts have tried more than 200 \r\ndefendants accused of heinous crimes, including top \r\nmilitary and political leaders. The Tribunals have \r\noperated on the principles of fairness, impartiality and \r\nindependence. They have also built up a robust body of \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nWith the historic work of the Tribunals now nearing \r\ncompletion, the United States heartily commends \r\nthe efforts of the Presidents of both bodies to enact \r\ncost-saving managerial and administrative measures \r\nand to transfer the Tribunals’ remaining functions to \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals. At the same time, we recognize that the \r\nexact closure dates will depend on the completion of \r\nongoing and soon-to-begin trials and appeals.\r\nTurning to the ICTY, we note that the Tribunal \r\nis continuing to focus on the completion of all trials \r\nand appeals, having rendered 13 trial, appellate and \r\ncontempt judgements between August 2012 and July \r\n2013. We are pleased that The Hague branch of the \r\nMechanism began operating in July. We also salute \r\nthe continuing work of the ICTY to build capacity \r\namong judges, prosecutors and defence counsels in \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. The United States urges all the \r\nGovernments in the region to continue to work towards \r\nreconciliation, while avoiding statements that inflame \r\ntensions, and to continue to bring accused war criminals \r\nto justice in local courts.\r\nWith regard to the ICTR, we note with satisfaction \r\nthat the Tribunal has wrapped up its workload of trials \r\nand is continuing to complete appeals, hopefully by \r\n2015. The Mechanism in Arusha opened in 2012 and is \r\noperating smoothly. The United States urges regional \r\nGovernments to work with the Tribunal on the relocation \r\nof several persons who have served their sentences \r\nbut are unable to return to Rwanda. We call upon all \r\nStates to cooperate with the ICTR in apprehending all \r\nremaining fugitives and bringing those accused mass \r\nmurderers to trial.\r\nThe United States remains committed to working \r\nwith the United Nations and the international \r\n13-51141 13/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\nMechanism. We note the progress with regard to the \r\nMechanism, as noted in document A/68/219.\r\nIn conclusion, we consider it important to preserve \r\nthe legacy of the Tribunals. As the work of the two \r\nTribunals nears completion, there is no doubt — and \r\nwe say this with conviction as Chair of the Informal \r\nWorking Group on International Tribunals of the \r\nSecurity Council — that they have laid a solid \r\nfoundation for international peace and justice through \r\ntheir development and implementation of international \r\ncriminal law.\r\nMr. Starčević (Serbia): Let me begin by welcoming \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, Judge \r\nTheodor Meron, and the President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda, Judge Vagn Joensen. I \r\nthank them for their presentations of the annual reports \r\nof the two Tribunals (A/68/270 and A/68/255), as well \r\nas for the presentation of the first annual report of \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals (A/68/219).\r\nThe Republic of Serbia welcomes the \r\ncommencement of the work of both branches of the \r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals and commends the steps taken to ensure a \r\nsmooth handover of functions. My country has placed \r\ncontinued and undivided importance on cooperating \r\nwith the ICTY and will continue to do so also with \r\nrespect to the International Residual Mechanism.\r\nLet me recall that, in July 2011, the Republic \r\nof Serbia completed its cooperation with respect to \r\nall indictees whose transfer had been requested by \r\nthe Tribunal. We are fully committed to cooperation \r\nin the area of access to documentation, archives and \r\nwitnesses. My country has refused no access request \r\nby either the ICTY Prosecutor or defence teams, and all \r\nwitnesses for whom waivers had been requested were \r\ngranted the waivers, which made it possible for them \r\nto testify before the Tribunal. We note with satisfaction \r\nthat the results of that cooperation have been assessed \r\nas positive.\r\nAt the same time, 399 persons have been tried so \r\nfar in the courts of the Republic of Serbia for criminal \r\noffences committed against international humanitarian \r\nlaw. The Republic of Serbia therefore showed not only \r\na firm commitment to complying with its international \r\nobligations, including the punishment of those \r\novercoming the sense of impunity are necessary bases \r\nfor possible reconciliation.\r\nIn that spirit, this year we celebrate the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 827 (1993), adopted unanimously, which \r\nestablished the International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia. Twenty years after the establishment \r\nof that Tribunal, we acknowledge its considerable \r\naccomplishments and progress in developing \r\ninternational jurisprudence, in obtaining justice for \r\nvictims, in capturing all fugitives and in bringing to \r\njustice those primarily responsible for the gravest \r\nviolations of human rights, irrespective of their rank. \r\nThe Tribunal has contributed to strengthening national \r\nsystems by working closely with local authorities.\r\nWith respect to the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda, we welcome the fact that it has completed \r\nall its legal work and met all its deadlines for appeals, \r\nand that it has proceeded with the transfer of cases to \r\nRwanda. It is of fundamental importance to assist the \r\ntribunals in finishing their work within the stipulated \r\ndeadlines. We listened attentively to the concerns \r\nexpressed by the Presidents of both Tribunals with \r\nrespect to their ability to keep up the pace of their work \r\nwhile also meeting the deadlines set for its conclusion. \r\nThe judges expressed the view that the lack of personnel \r\nand the loss of highly efficient members of their \r\nstaffs had affected trials and appeals. We share their \r\nconcerns, especially with respect to the need to have \r\nadequate, experienced staff. The judges also raised the \r\nissue of relocating those who have been absolved of \r\ntheir crimes as well as those who have already served \r\ntheir sentences. Some of them have been living in safe \r\nhouses in Arusha for the past six years. That is an \r\nimportant humanitarian matter that deserves careful \r\nconsideration. For that reason, we support the strategic \r\nrelocation plan that was recently presented to the \r\nInformal Working Group on International Tribunals, \r\nwhich we are honoured to chair. We urge Member States, \r\nin particular the members of the Security Council able \r\nto do so, to help resolve that persistent problem, and \r\nwe congratulate those that have already increased their \r\ncooperation with the Tribunal in that regard.\r\nWe note with satisfaction the progress achieved \r\nin the implementation of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals. We welcome the \r\nfact that both Tribunals have worked together to ensure \r\na gradual, effective transition towards the Residual \r\n14/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\neffect that the enforcement of sentences should take \r\nplace outside the territory of the former Yugoslavia \r\nmay have been valid two decades ago, but it has been \r\nevident for a long period that this is no longer the case.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that by fulfilling its \r\nobligations with respect to its cooperation with the \r\nICTY, as well as by trying war crimes in domestic courts \r\nwith the highest professional standards, the Republic \r\nof Serbia has made a significant contribution to the \r\nTribunal’s completion strategy, as well as to the process \r\nof the normalization of relations among the countries \r\nof the region. All the results of my country’s years of \r\ncooperation with the Tribunal indicate the Republic \r\nof Serbia’s seriousness and its readiness to accept \r\ninternational supervision of the serving of sentences and \r\nto provide firm guarantees that the sentenced persons \r\nwill not be paroled without the requisite decisions of \r\nthe ICTY, the International Residual Mechanism or \r\nsome other organ or body of the United Nations to be \r\ncharged with those issues in the future.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): At \r\nthe outset, let me join previous speakers in thanking \r\nJudge Theodor Meron, President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nand the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals, and Judge Vagn Joensen, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). We \r\nnote with gratitude the progress made in the activities \r\nof the ICTR and ICTY, and the first annual report of \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals (A/68/219), during the period under review.\r\nTanzania reaffirms its unwavering support for the \r\nwork of the ICTR and the ICTY. Both Tribunals have \r\ncontinued to make invaluable contributions to our shared \r\ngoal of ending impunity for the most serious crimes of \r\ninternational concern and have been instrumental in \r\nbringing about a new age of accountability.\r\nThe achievement of the Tribunals represent a \r\nmilestone in the development of international criminal \r\njurisprudence. We therefore pay tribute to the United \r\nNations, its dedicated staff and the officials of the \r\nTribunals, the Governments of Rwanda and the Former \r\nYugoslavia and the international community as a whole.\r\nWe welcome the steady progress that the Tribunals \r\nhave made during the reporting period towards the \r\ncompletion of their mandates. We are encouraged by \r\nthe efforts that the Tribunals have made to ensure a \r\nsmooth transition to the Residual Mechanism. We note \r\nresponsible for committing crimes, irrespective of their \r\nethnicity, but also to establishing the whole truth about \r\nthe crimes committed during the armed conflicts in \r\nthe territory of the former Socialist Federal Republic \r\nof Yugoslavia, as we are convinced of the importance \r\nof making a contribution to establishing justice and \r\nthe process of regional reconciliation. In that respect, \r\nmy country has shown its readiness to accept its own \r\nnationals, as well as other willing persons tried by the \r\nICTY, to serve their sentences in Serbia. We are also \r\nready to provide full security guarantees regarding the \r\nlocations in which those sentences would be served.\r\nLet me recall that, on 20 January 2011, the Republic \r\nof Serbia signed an agreement with the International \r\nCriminal Court on the enforcement of its sentences. \r\nUnder the agreement, persons sentenced before the \r\nCourt for the commission of war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and genocide may serve their sentences of \r\nimprisonment in the Republic of Serbia. It is stressed \r\nthat Serbia is the first country in Eastern Europe to \r\nsign such an agreement with the International Criminal \r\nCourt.\r\nTaking into account that the purpose of punishment \r\nalso includes the re-socialization of the sentenced \r\npersons, my country is of the opinion that this goal can \r\nhardly be achieved if those persons serve their sentences \r\nin countries whose languages they do not speak or \r\nunderstand, whereby additional impediments to their \r\ncommunication with the environment are created. \r\nAlso, it should be noted that most of the countries in \r\nwhich the sentences are served are geographically far \r\nfrom Serbia, which makes relatives’ visits much more \r\ndifficult and sometimes impossible.\r\nSince 2009, the Republic of Serbia has insisted on \r\nsigning an agreement on the enforcement of sentences, \r\nand has actively endeavoured to have those sentenced \r\nby the Tribunal serve their sentences in their own \r\ncountries. Regrettably, however, no breakthrough of any \r\nsignificance has been made in that regard. We consider \r\nthat the main reason for the stalemate is the fact that \r\nthe countries that emerged in the territory of the former \r\nYugoslavia are not in a position to conclude agreements \r\nwith the Tribunal on the enforcement of sentences, \r\nalthough the President of ICTY has emphasized on \r\nvarious occasions that efforts should continue to be \r\nmade to sign agreements in sufficient numbers to enable \r\nthe mandate of the ICTY to be completed successfully. \r\nWe believe that the recommendation of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to the Security Council from May 1993 to the \r\n13-51141 15/16\r\n14/10/2013 A/68/PV.33\r\ndevelopments and see them as an important step in \r\nthe next phase of the work and, indeed, legacy of the \r\nTribunal.\r\nMr. Estremé (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina is particularly appreciative of the presence \r\nhere today of Judges Meron and Joensen, as well \r\nas of the presentation of the reports of the two \r\nTribunals (A/68/255 and A/68/270) and on the work \r\nof the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals (A/68/219).\r\nMy country is a member of the Security Council, \r\nand as such we have had an opportunity to receive \r\ninformation in advance of those reports. We welcome \r\nthe fact that the General Assembly is considering them \r\ntoday because, as the Council meeting on 12 June \r\nrevealed (see S/PV.6977), all the Members of the \r\nOrganization are interested in the work of the Tribunals \r\nand the Mechanism. Today’s debate is of particular \r\nrelevance because this year marks the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nWe welcome the progress reported with regard \r\nto the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia, in particular that during the reporting \r\nperiod judgements were rendered in the first instance \r\nin five cases, four appeals and three cases guilty \r\nof contempt of court. We acknowledge the effort it \r\nrepresents for the Tribunals to adjust their work to the \r\ndeadlines and time frames being contemplated against \r\nthe backdrop of staff reductions, including translators. \r\nWith regard to the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, \r\nwe are pleased that the Security Council has agreed on a \r\nmechanism to elect an additional judge for the Appeals \r\nChamber, as requested by the President of the Tribunal. \r\nArgentina supported that request in the Council and \r\nwe trust that, with the elections to be held shortly, the \r\nTribunal will soon have an additional judge.\r\nMy country welcomes the information concerning \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the \r\nmeeting of the deadlines and forecasts with regard to \r\ncases at the trial and appeals stages. We also welcome \r\nthe fact that transition to the Residual Mechanism \r\ncontinues in line with those time frames, including the \r\ndelivery of the archives to the Mechanism by the end \r\nof 2014.\r\nWe highlight the importance of the appeal in the \r\nNgirabatware case, which will be the first one resolved \r\nby the Mechanism. We also underscore the importance \r\nwith appreciation that the trials of the ICTR have been \r\nconcluded in an efficient and timely manner without \r\ncompromising fair-trial rights. We are confident that \r\nthe ongoing appeals, including those under the Residual \r\nMechanism, will enjoy similar rights and privileges.\r\nAcquitted and released persons are still in the care \r\nof the ICTR detention facility in Tanzania and need \r\nto be relocated. We reiterate our call for urgent action \r\nto find host countries for the acquitted persons who \r\nremain in Arusha under the Tribunal’s protection, as \r\nwell as for the convicted persons who are still in the \r\ncare of the ICTR detention facility in Arusha. We \r\ntherefore encourage the Residual Mechanism to pursue, \r\nas a matter of priority, agreements with additional \r\nMember States for the enforcement of sentences. We \r\ncall on States to continue to cooperate with and support \r\nboth Tribunals as well as the Residual Mechanism in \r\ntracking and in apprehending the remaining fugitives \r\nso that they may finally be brought to justice.\r\nMy delegation is concerned that, as the Tribunals \r\nare in the final process of concluding their work, \r\nfurther staff attrition continues to impede the timely \r\nachievement of the goals of their completion strategies. \r\nWe support the call to the Secretariat and other relevant \r\nUnited Nations bodies to find practical solutions to \r\naddress the staffing situation and make it possible for \r\nthe Tribunals to complete their work in a timely manner.\r\nWe welcome the transfer of cases to Rwandan \r\ndomestic courts for prosecution. We note with \r\nappreciation that the Tribunals have continued to \r\nfurther develop their interaction with the authorities \r\nof Rwanda and the States of the former Yugoslavia to \r\nencourage cooperation with the Tribunals and support \r\ndomestic war-crimes prosecutions. We hope to see \r\nthose efforts being further enhanced in support of the \r\nMechanism’s mandate.\r\nThe establishment of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals is significant \r\nto the continued protection of the rights of victims, \r\nwitnesses and persons tried by the ICTR and ICTY \r\nand to maintaining the legacy of the Tribunals. Allow \r\nme to commend the practical arrangements made by \r\nthe Secretary-General pursuant to Security Council \r\nresolution 1966 (2010) in ensuring that the operations of \r\nthe Mechanism begin. We are pleased that the transition \r\nfrom the ICTR to the Arusha branch of the Mechanism \r\nhas been successful. We note that the inauguration \r\nof the operationalization of the ICTY branch of the \r\nResidual Mechanism as of 1 July. We welcome those \r\n16/16 13-51141\r\nA/68/PV.33 14/10/2013\r\nserves as the central point of the criminal justice for the \r\nentire international community.\r\nIt is not amnesty, be it de jure or de facto, that helps \r\nthe victims of heinous crimes. Rather it is ensuring \r\nthat justice is rendered by impartial and independent \r\ncourts. Argentina once again expresses its support for \r\nthe work of the International Crimininal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia. On this twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, we pay tribute \r\nto the Tribunal’s outstanding contribution to combating \r\nimpunity.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on the agenda items before us.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to take note of the eighteenth annual report \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(A/68/270)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I also take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the Assembly to take note of the twentieth \r\nannual report of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (A/68/255)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to take note of the first annual \r\nreport of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals (A/68/219)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 73, 74 and 130?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 a.m.\r\nof arresting the three remaining fugitives and the fact \r\nthat Security Council resolution 955 (1994) establishes \r\nthe obligation of all States to fully cooperate with \r\nthe Tribunal. Cooperation with the Tribunal is also \r\nimportant when it comes to relocating the seven \r\npeople found not guilty and the three who have already \r\ncompleted their sentences. With regard to the Residual \r\nMechanism, we acknowledge the progress in its \r\nbecoming fully operational, as well as the fact that the \r\nArusha branch has been operational since July 2012.\r\nWe also wish to highlight the opening of The Hague \r\nbranch, on 1 July. That branch carries functions with \r\nrespect to the Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in \r\nthe manner that the Arusha branch does in connection \r\nwith the Rwanda Tribunal. Argentina commends the \r\nMechanism’s work with regard to monitoring Tribunal \r\ncases sent to Rwandan national courts, as well as the \r\nattention given to ensuring continuity between the \r\nTribunals and the Mechanism, which is necessary to \r\nensuring due process at this time of transition.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 827 (1993) marked a \r\nmilestone because, five decades after the Nuremberg \r\ntrials, it expressed the premise that impunity for \r\nserious crimes was unacceptable. It also reflected the \r\ncommitment of the Security Council — and, along \r\nwith it, of the entire Organization — to accountability. \r\nTwenty years after the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the \r\ninternational community should acknowledge the \r\nprogress made in combating impunity thanks to \r\nboth Tribunals. The Tribunals have made important \r\nnormative contributions to the development of \r\ninternational law. They have blazed a trail on which \r\nthere is no turning back — with regard to accountability \r\nas well when it comes to the fact that the international \r\ncommunity has already acknowledged that there can \r\nbe no lasting peace without justice. That legacy has \r\nbeen definitively shaped by the establishment of the \r\npermanent International Criminal Court, which today \r\n"
