"The meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 120\r\nFollow-up to the commemoration of the  \r\ntwo-hundredth anniversary of the abolition  \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/68/135  \r\nand A/68/291)\r\nDraft resolution (A/68/L.7)\r\nThe President: Many will recall that paragraph 101 \r\nof the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nof 2001 invited the international community and its \r\nmember States to honour the victims of slavery and the \r\nslave trade in this follow-up exercise. All of us will, \r\nno doubt, recall that in December 2011, the Assembly \r\nendorsed the initiative of Member States to erect, at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters, a permanent memorial \r\nin honour of the tragedy of slavery and the slave trade.\r\nApproximately one month ago, I had the distinct \r\nhonour to speak at the unveiling of the winning design \r\nfor the permanent memorial honouring those victims. \r\nThree hundred and ten artists from 83 countries drew \r\nupon their creative faculties to reinforce, through the \r\nmedium of the visual arts, sentiments to which Member \r\nStates had already given eloquent voice in the Durban \r\nDeclaration and subsequently. The design that the \r\njudges considered to be most expressive of the desired \r\nmessage was appropriately entitled Ark of Return and its \r\ncreative artist, Mr. Rodney Leon, is a native of Haiti, a \r\ncountry with an illustrious history and its own struggle \r\nto end slavery — a struggle that has taken a heavy \r\ntoll on its people. Mr. Leon described his winning \r\nsubmission as depicting\r\n“a sacred space that is designed to psychologically \r\nand spiritually transport visitors to a place where \r\nacknowledgement, education, reflection and \r\nhealing can take place.”\r\nJust as other monuments erected on the grounds of \r\nthe United Nations serve to remind the international \r\ncommunity to honour the values of peace and \r\nnon-violence, it is my sincere hope and wish that \r\nthe soon-to be-erected Ark of Return will serve a \r\ncorresponding purpose as a tribute to the collective \r\naspirations of this Organization, namely: peace, human \r\nrights, social justice and the dignity of human beings.\r\nThe year 2013 marks the 206th anniversary of the \r\nabolition of the transatlantic slave trade. The General \r\nAssembly’s engagement with the question of slavery \r\nand the slave trade continues with draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.7, before us today, as we commit once again to \r\nraising public awareness about the legacy of that dark \r\nperiod in our past. Since the United Nations began \r\nconsidering this item some years ago, there have been \r\nnumerous initiatives at the national and international \r\nlevels, dedicated to the noble goals of remembering and \r\nhonouring all the victims of that monstrously inhumane \r\npractice. Through their various efforts, Member States, \r\nUnited Nations agencies and civil-society partners \r\nhave celebrated the indomitable spirit of the victims of \r\na tragedy that continues to be inflicted upon numerous \r\npersons today, albeit in more subtle forms, including \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.35\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n35th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 21 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It was a time when \r\nnations became great and wealthy. Others emerged \r\nwhile some were subjugated and exploited. Some \r\nscholars posit the view that slavery is one of the most \r\ninfluential phenomena in history, shaping every aspect \r\nof the world as we now know it.\r\nSo it is an honour for me to introduce today’s draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.7 in the Assembly, where once again \r\nthe global community has the opportunity to condemn \r\nthat contemptible and barbaric historical practice, \r\nbut also to renew a pledge to ensure that nothing of \r\nthe kind is ever again visited on humanity. Draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.7, entitled “Permanent memorial \r\nto and remembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”, the text of which is before us \r\ntoday, continues to take account of the importance of \r\nensuring that current and future generations are made \r\naware of the past and exhorted to join in a determination \r\nto prevent anything so dastardly from ever happening \r\nagain.\r\nA key activity in that quest is the erection here at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters of a permanent memorial \r\nto honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. Let me take this opportunity, as Chair of \r\nthe committee established to steer the project to reality, \r\nto advise the Assembly of the successful completion of \r\nthe international artistic competition to select a design \r\nfor the memorial, held over the past two years.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to UNESCO and the United Nations Office \r\nfor Partnerships for their excellent collaboration in \r\nconducting the competition. A total of 310 entries were \r\nreceived, from persons representing 83 nationalities. \r\nSixteen contestants were shortlisted and evaluated \r\nthrough an anonymous procedure by an international \r\npanel of judges, all of whom are experts in their fields \r\nand reflect a cross-section of nationalities. Seven \r\nfinalists were brought to New York and interviewed, \r\nand their models were assessed by the judges, who \r\ncame to a unanimous decision on the winning design, \r\nArk of Return, by Rodney Leon, which was unveiled \r\non 23 September in a special ceremony here at the \r\nUnited Nations. I would like to once again congratulate \r\nMr. Leon and the other finalists, whose works, we are \r\ntold by the judges, were all of high quality and showed \r\na good understanding of the depth and importance of \r\nthe subject matter.\r\nsocial and economic inequality, hatred, bigotry, racism \r\nand prejudice.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/68/291) \r\nhighlights the educational, outreach and awareness-\r\nraising activities undertaken following resolution \r\n67/108. Those campaigns provide an opportunity not \r\nonly to reflect upon the history and legacy of slavery \r\nbut also to address questions such as the dearth of \r\nresources and materials in educational institutions \r\nworldwide on why slavery happened, the full extent \r\nof its consequences and what lessons we have learned \r\nfrom it. In addition to helping ensure that the past is \r\nremembered and never repeated, those activities also \r\noffer an opportunity to highlight the often-overlooked \r\ncontributions that enslaved Africans made to their \r\neconomies and communities.\r\nAmong the principles on which the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations was shaped are those of equality \r\nand non-discrimination. The Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights proclaims that all human beings are \r\nborn free and equal in dignity and rights; that no one \r\nshall be held in slavery and servitude and that slavery \r\nand the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms. \r\nBy adopting the draft resolution today, we dedicate \r\nourselves, once again, to the task of undertaking \r\nconcrete and concerted actions to uphold those rights \r\nand freedoms. Once again, we also commit ourselves to \r\ninitiating and supporting efforts that make it abundantly \r\nclear to the cradle of humanity what such violations of \r\nhuman rights and dignity represent. My hope is that our \r\njoint recollection of the horrors of slavery and the slave \r\ntrade will move us to further resolute and concrete \r\naction. Let us make a fresh resolve today that slavery, \r\nin whatever form or manifestation, will forever be a \r\nthing of the past.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Jamaica, \r\nwho will introduce draft resolution A/68/L.7.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): The institutionalized \r\nsystem of slavery and its enabler, the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade, represent an appalling yet consequential period \r\nin the course of our human history. They reflect a \r\ntragic age when successful efforts to divide the human \r\nfamily were played out on a grand scale, encompassing \r\nthe vast geographic and economic triangle linking \r\nEurope, Africa and the Americas. It was a time when \r\nour common humanity was not yet acknowledged, and \r\na man and his family, through barbaric exploitation, \r\ncould claim ownership of another man, woman or child, \r\n13-52279 3/9\r\n21/10/2013 A/68/PV.35\r\nand prejudice and that promotes healing, tolerance and \r\nrespect for diversity.\r\nIt is for that reason that we have continued to \r\nemphasize the work of the United Nations through \r\nthe Department of Public Information in maintaining \r\na focus on that important aspect of relations in global \r\nsociety. I commend the excellent work that has been \r\ndone by the Department of Public Information over the \r\nyears and implore all Member States to actively engage \r\nin the outreach programme envisaged in the draft \r\nresolution. The Secretary-General’s report (A/68/291) \r\nillustrates the large selection of noteworthy activities \r\nthat the Organization has undertaken across the globe to \r\nachieve that mandate. We encourage further activities \r\nto that end.\r\nIn commending this draft for adoption, let us be \r\nreminded that we share one humanity and that there is \r\nno place for prejudice and discrimination in the world \r\ntoday. As we mark those milestones, the best way to \r\nhonour the memory of those victims is to fulfil their \r\nfundamental hope for equality, dignity, humanity and \r\njustice for every human being. I am pleased, therefore, \r\non behalf of the Caribbean Community, the African \r\nGroup and all our sponsors, to present this draft for \r\nconsideration and adoption.\r\nMr. Kumar (India): I deem it a singular privilege \r\nto be able to speak on behalf of my country on this \r\nimportant agenda item before the General Assembly. I \r\nwould like to welcome the Secretary-General’s report \r\non the programme of educational outreach on the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade and slavery (A/68/291), and \r\nhis status report on the United Nations Trust Fund for \r\nPartnerships—Permanent Memorial, that is, for the \r\npermanent memorial to and remembrance of the victims \r\nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade (A/68/135).\r\nThe transatlantic slave trade is one of the most \r\nabhorrent chapters in the history of humankind. It \r\nravaged African and Caribbean nations to satisfy the \r\nrapacious economic greed and exploitation of colonizers. \r\nThe lingering consequences of its brutality and human \r\nsuffering are visible even today. We must, therefore, \r\ntake initiatives to ensure that future generations do \r\nnot forget the grief and tragedy borne by the countless \r\nnameless victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade. It is equally imperative that the international \r\ncommunity take upon itself a commitment to ensuring \r\nthat such crimes against humanity will never recur. \r\nEducation has a critical role in creating awareness \r\nThe Ark of Return, according to the judges, is an \r\nentirely feasible and appropriate proposal, which has \r\nan impressive visual impact and invites exploration by \r\nthe viewers. We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to \r\nthe panel of distinguished judges — Mr. David Boxer, \r\nfrom my own country, Jamaica; Ms. Nadia Bakhurji, \r\nfrom Saudi Arabia; Ms. Dominique Fontaine, from \r\nCanada and Haiti; Mr. Michael Gomez, from New York \r\nUniversity, here in the United States; and Mr. Ashfar \r\nIsahq, from Pakistan — who undertook this enormous \r\ntask on a completely voluntary basis and have \r\ncollectively pledged their ongoing commitment to the \r\nmemorial.\r\nIt would be remiss of me to not also convey \r\ndeep appreciation to those Member States that have \r\nso generously contributed to the Trust Fund for the \r\nPermanent Memorial. We appreciate all donations \r\nreceived, which in many ways reflect the broader \r\ncommitment to the goals of the permanent memorial \r\nproject, as represented not only in the draft resolution \r\nbefore us but in those we have annually adopted under \r\nthis agenda item since 2006. We also express thanks \r\nto a range of private individuals, corporations and \r\nfoundations that have made contributions as well. That \r\nbroadens the scope of ownership of and fidelity to this \r\nnoble initiative.\r\nThe ongoing work to bring this worthy project to \r\ncompletion would not have been possible without the \r\nvision and unstinting support of a team of pioneers who \r\nlaid the firm foundation on which we now build. Here \r\nI must mention my predecessor, Ambassador Raymond \r\nWolfe, who worked tirelessly to bring the vision to \r\nreality. Allow me also to make special mention of \r\nMr. Amir Dossal, former head of the United Nations \r\nOffice for Partnerships, who was a committed partner \r\nand who, although officially retired from the United \r\nNations, remains faithful to the initiative.\r\nWe will now embark on the final phase of the \r\nproject, which is to commission the construction and \r\nerection of the memorial on a United Nations podium. \r\nThe aim of the draft resolution is not only to endorse the \r\nerection of the monument. Although that in itself is an \r\nadmirable accomplishment in honour of the victims of \r\nslavery, we consider that the more important aspect of \r\nthe draft resolution is the fact that it that calls for broad \r\neducation and outreach to disseminate information to \r\nthe global public on the history and impact of slavery. \r\nThe aim is to influence modern social norms in a way \r\nthat rejects racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\n4/9 13-52279\r\nA/68/PV.35 21/10/2013\r\nefforts they have been making to the realization of the \r\nPermanent Memorial. I admit we all have to do more.\r\nThe transatlantic slave trade is the gravest crime \r\ncommitted against humanity with few rivals in its \r\ninfamy and cruelty. The inhumane and barbaric manner \r\nin which it was committed, its magnitude and the time \r\nspan over which it was allowed to continue have no par \r\nin history and will remain a scar on the conscience of \r\nhumanity. Africans and peoples of African descent have \r\nsuffered for centuries owing to that horrendous crime. \r\nEven after the official abolition of the slave trade, its \r\ninstitutionalized legacy continued to be a source of \r\nexploitation, humiliation, discrimination, bias, hatred, \r\nprejudice and racism against peoples of African origin \r\nboth in the continent and elsewhere.\r\nAs we remember that unparalleled crime, we cherish \r\nthe struggles of those Africans and their descendants, \r\nwho aspired and dreamed to live in freedom and equality. \r\nWe recognize, with great emotion, their contribution \r\nto the genesis of the ideal of Pan-Africanism, an ideal \r\nthat inspired a people’s movement in the diaspora, \r\nwhich was later joined by Africans from the continent. \r\nIndeed, that movement, among other things, created \r\nthe momentum for Africa’s quest for freedom from the \r\nyoke of colonialism and, later, for the establishment of \r\nthe Organization of African Unity (OAU). As we are \r\ncelebrating the golden jubilee of the OAU/African Union \r\nthis year, we indeed remember those who perished and \r\nthe immense contribution of those who followed them.\r\nIt is therefore imperative that we remember those \r\nwho perished and were uprooted. That has meaning for \r\ntoday and for the future and posterity. We are of the \r\nview that a clear and frank analysis of the situation and \r\nthe heroic struggle of those who rose up against slavery \r\ncan provide a valuable perspective and be a source of \r\npride and motivation for present and future generations \r\nin overcoming today’s challenges.\r\nIn that connection, we have noted with satisfaction \r\nthe successful conclusion of the international design \r\ncompetition for the Permanent Memorial and the \r\nselection of the design for Ark of Return as the model \r\nfor the permanent memorial. However, the fact that \r\nas of June 2013 the United Nations Trust Fund for \r\nPartnerships—Permanent Memorial has received only \r\n$1.37 million as against the anticipated expenditure of \r\nthree times that existing balance for the construction of \r\nthe Memorial is indicative of how much more we still \r\nhave to do. In that regard, we encourage Member States \r\namong current and future generations of the history, \r\ncauses and impact of slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade. A better understanding of history provides a \r\nvaluable perspective for confronting today’s challenges.\r\nIndia welcomes the various outreach activities and \r\nprogrammes organized in March by the Department of \r\nPublic Information to commemorate the International \r\nDay of Remembrance at the United Nations, as well as \r\nin other countries, through its network of information \r\ncentres and partner organizations. We stress the need \r\nfor regular and adequate allocation of financing to the \r\nDepartment for organizing such events. We also welcome \r\nthe initiatives undertaken by States in reaffirming their \r\ncommitment to implement paragraphs 101 and 102 of \r\nthe Durban Declaration, aimed at countering the legacy \r\nof slavery and honouring the memory of the victims of \r\nslavery and the slave trade.\r\nThe construction of a permanent memorial will be \r\na fitting tribute by the United Nations to the millions \r\nof victims of the transatlantic slave trade. We are \r\npleased to note that the international competition to \r\nfinalize the memorial design has been concluded, \r\nand that the Secretary-General and the President of \r\nthe General Assembly unveiled the winning design \r\nin September. With the sum of $260,000, India is the \r\nlead contributor to the United Nations Trust Fund for \r\nPartnerships — Permanent Memorial for erecting \r\na permanent memorial. So far, however, the Trust \r\nFund has received only close to $1.4 million, against \r\nan anticipated cost of $4.5 million for the memorial’s \r\nconstruction. We therefore strongly urge all countries, \r\nand particularly those that benefited from the \r\ntransatlantic trade, to come forward and contribute \r\ngenerously to show their earnest admission that wrongs \r\nwere committed and that there is a sense of repentance.\r\nAs we recall the struggle, the degradation and the \r\ndeaths of the victims of the transatlantic slave trade, \r\nwe hope that a permanent memorial can be constructed \r\nat an early date. It will indeed be a small but fitting \r\ncommemoration of the struggle of the victims, who \r\nsuffered silently, with no hope of freedom, before they \r\ndisappeared into the night. We have a chance to pay our \r\nhumble tribute to those who suffered that disgrace by \r\ncontributing generously to the Trust Fund. That is the \r\nleast we can all do.\r\nMr. Alemu (Ethiopia): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the African Group. I would like to pay \r\ntribute to Jamaica and all involved for the tireless \r\n13-52279 5/9\r\n21/10/2013 A/68/PV.35\r\nalike to raise awareness of the history of the slave trade \r\nas well as to highlight the invaluable contributions made \r\nby persons of African descent in every field of human \r\nendeavour. The United States is proud to congratulate \r\nMr. Rodney Leon on his being chosen to design the \r\nPermanent Memorial. Mr. Leon, a Haitian-American, \r\nis a celebrated artist whose work has offered our nation \r\nspace and inspiration to reflect on our painful history \r\nas well as on the progress we have made. His design, \r\nArk of Return, will inspire us to remember and honour \r\nthe victims of the transatlantic slave trade, to reflect \r\non the past and the lessons we have learned, and to \r\ncontemplate the steps we each must take to combat \r\nthe lingering consequences of slavery and to eradicate \r\ndiscrimination.\r\nThe United States is honoured to co-sponsor today’s \r\ndraft resolution (A/68/L.7) on the Permanent Memorial \r\nto and remembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntranslatlantic slave trade. We must never forget the \r\nterrible human tragedy of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade and the moral courage of those who worked \r\nto end it.\r\nMr. Magid (Israel): I would like to thank \r\nAmbassador Rattray and the Permanent Mission of \r\nJamaica for their leadership and their efforts to bring \r\nthis important subject to the forefront of the United \r\nNations agenda.\r\nThe American author Robert Heinlein once said, \r\n“A generation that ignores history has no past … and \r\nno future”. Today we recommit ourselves to memory \r\nso as to ensure that the tragedies of the past have clear \r\nlessons for the future. The transatlantic slave trade \r\ncasts a dark shadow over history. The enslavement of \r\nAfricans was cruel and dehumanizing. Thirty million \r\npeople were forced from their homes, uprooted from \r\nvillages and driven into bondage. Many have recalled \r\nthe horrific conditions during their voyages and their \r\nconditions during their enslavement. The dark centuries \r\nof the slave trade represent one of the longest and most \r\nsustained assaults on the life, integrity and dignity of \r\nhuman beings in history, yet even after the abolition \r\nof slavery, living conditions for African communities \r\nremained horrific during the nineteenth century.\r\nThe Jewish people share the story of people who \r\nwere persecuted. The Jewish Bible describes how the \r\nJewish people emerged from bitter enslavement in \r\nancient Egypt to become a nation in the land of Israel. \r\nThey remained there until conquering forces expelled \r\nand other interested parties to make further voluntary \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund. We all have obligations, \r\nwithout exception.\r\nIn our view, the Memorial will not only serve as \r\na hallmark for us to pay our respect but will also be a \r\nreminder for the international community of the grief \r\nand tragedy borne by the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade.\r\nAfrica welcomes the various remembrance activities \r\nand programmes undertaken by the Department of \r\nPublic Information, including the commemorative \r\nactivities at the United Nations in March 2013. We \r\nsupport the continued efforts of the Department of \r\nPublic Information to utilize its network of global \r\ninformation centres to build awareness on the issue. We \r\nalso welcome the initiatives undertaken by States in \r\nreaffirming their commitment to implement paragraphs \r\n101 and 102 of the Durban Declaration of the World \r\nConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, \r\nXenophobia and Related Intolerance, aimed at \r\ncountering the legacy of slavery and honouring the \r\nmemory of the victims of slavery and the slave trade.\r\nAs sponsors of draft resolution A/68/L.7, the States \r\nmembers of the Africa Group fully support the speedy \r\nimplementation of the initiative of Member States \r\nto erect, in a place of prominence at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters that is easily accessible to representatives, \r\nUnited Nations staff and visitors, a permanent memorial \r\nin acknowledgement of the tragedy and in consideration \r\nof the legacy of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. \r\nThe adoption of a draft resolution is the least we can do.\r\nMr. Strickland (United States of America): As \r\na multicultural society, the United States remains \r\ncommitted to fighting racism, safeguarding the \r\ndignity of people regardless of race or background and \r\ncountering the hateful legacy of slavery. We believe \r\nstrongly in spreading awareness of the struggle of the \r\nmen, women and children who fell victim to slavery \r\nand to educating future generations on that tragic past \r\nas a means of combating racism and prejudice. The \r\nUnited States continues to press forward on eliminating \r\ndiscrimination within our own country, as well as in \r\njoining the global community in creating a world of \r\nfreedom and equality for all.\r\nIn addition, the United States has supported \r\nUNESCO’s Breaking the Silence transatlantic slave \r\ntrade education project. As part of that effort, we have \r\nengaged Governments and civil society organizations \r\n6/9 13-52279\r\nA/68/PV.35 21/10/2013\r\nlike to support the statement made by the Ambassador \r\nof Jamaica.\r\nThis morning’s discussion is, for my delegation, \r\na very special one. Indeed, it is occurring only a few \r\ndays after 17 October, the anniversary of the death \r\nof the founder of the Haitian nation, Jean-Jacques \r\nDessalines. It also takes place just a few days after the \r\ncommemorative activities held by the authorities of the \r\ncity of Savannah at the memorial erected to the memory \r\nof the Haitian heroes who took part in the great battle of \r\nSavannah, at the end of the eighteenth century.\r\nThe commemorative activities conducted by our \r\nOrganization, the information provided by its Member \r\nStates in their national educational programmes, \r\nunder paragraph 8 of resolution 67/108, and the many \r\nprogrammes developed by UNESCO all show that we \r\nare on the right path regarding the goals we have set \r\nourselves. My delegation can only encourage staying \r\nthe course.\r\nIn the same vein, we welcome the noble initiative \r\ntaken up by Member States to build a Permanent \r\nMemorial at United Nations Headquarters. The \r\nexecution of such a project will be an important \r\nmoment in the life of our Organization. Beyond its \r\nsymbolic significance, the Memorial should serve as \r\na real catalyst for unity and for a major reconciliation \r\namong peoples. The Memorial must also contribute to \r\ncombating forgetfulness and to building this great work \r\nof memory, so very necessary in order to serve as a \r\nreminder that throughout history thousands of human \r\nbeings have been deprived of their freedom and treated \r\nas things, as merchandise, as something that is valuable \r\nand to be exploited at will.\r\nMy delegation would therefore like to welcome \r\nthe establishment of a trust fund for the Permanent \r\nMemorial, called the United Nations Trust Fund for \r\nPartnerships—Permanent Memorial, and takes this \r\nopportunity to express its deep gratitude to all States \r\nthat have made contributions to the Fund. For my \r\ndelegation, the Permanent Memorial will represent \r\nan acknowledgement of the bitter struggles that \r\nour ancestors waged to eradicate forever that cruel, \r\ninhuman and degrading order that the colonial and \r\nslavery system represented, to bring about a new world. \r\nOur presence here to discuss it is a clear manifestation \r\nof that.\r\nMy country was the pioneer of that great struggle. \r\nHaiti’s contribution to the birth of that free world \r\nand scattered them across the globe. Powerless and \r\npersecuted, they suffered in every country and every \r\ncentury. Every day for 2,000 years, Jews prayed, asking \r\nGod to return them to the land of Israel. At long last, \r\nin 1948, we realized independence and the opportunity \r\nto rebuild our own land. We built our State on the \r\nprinciples of freedom, tolerance and understanding.\r\nThe Jewish people identify with the suffering of \r\nthe peoples of Africa and the Caribbean and all those \r\nwho share a burdened history. Because we were born \r\nin slavery, we understand the yearning for freedom. \r\nBecause we suffered the indignity of persecution, we \r\nunderstand the value of human dignity. And because \r\nfor 2,000 years Jews’ lives were held to be cheap, we \r\nunderstand the sanctity of life.\r\nIsrael is proud of its financial contribution to the \r\nPermanent Memorial in honour of victims of slavery \r\nand the international slave trade. We are honoured to be \r\namong the sponsors of the draft resolution on the topic, \r\nas we have been every year. The Memorial must serve \r\nas a call to action — a call to every nation, every leader \r\nand every citizen — to do everything they can to ensure \r\nthat no human being is ever enslaved.\r\nAll human beings are born free and equal in \r\ndignity and rights. Yet as we gather here today, many \r\naround the world are not free. Every year, hundreds of \r\nthousands of people, mostly women and children, are \r\ntrafficked across borders worldwide. The trafficking of \r\nhuman beings is a grave injustice that has no place in a \r\ncivilized world. There is also no place in the civilized \r\nworld for those who enslave others with hate, racism and \r\nprejudice. They are the fuel that power persecution, war \r\nand violence. We must believe in memorials. Through \r\neducation, remembrance and vigilance we can ensure \r\nthat the tragedies of the past serve as clear lessons for \r\nthe future.\r\nIsrael joins with the international community today \r\nin advancing that work. Together, we must extend a \r\npromise to our children that freedom is universal, \r\ndignity is inherent, and that life is sacred.\r\nMr. Gaspard (Haiti) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, allow me to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports (A/68/135 and A/68/291) and also to welcome \r\nthe excellent work carried out by the commemoration \r\ncommittee for the 200th anniversary under the wise \r\nand energetic leadership of our friend and brother \r\ncountry, Jamaica. In that regard, my delegation would \r\n13-52279 7/9\r\n21/10/2013 A/68/PV.35\r\nHere we would like to show that solidarity is not simply \r\nconnected to the wealth of a State. It is first and foremost \r\na matter of the heart, of generosity, of humanity.\r\nAll that is to say that we attach great importance \r\nto the monitoring of the commemoration of the \r\nbicentenary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade. The choice of theme, “Victory over slavery: Haiti \r\nand beyond,” to commemorate 2014 is for us a source \r\nof pride, satisfaction and recognition of Haiti’s historic \r\nrole in the fight to end slavery. We welcome the choice.\r\nAt the opening of the international conference held \r\nin 2009 on the Haitian Revolution and the universality \r\nof human rights, the then UNESCO Assistant Director-\r\nGeneral for Social and Human Sciences, Mr. Pierre \r\nSané, presented Haiti as the cradle of human rights. He \r\nsaid, “The universality of human rights was conceived \r\nin Paris in 1789, but the birth occurred in Haiti a few \r\nyears later”.\r\nIn conclusion, may the construction of the \r\nPermanent Memorial lead to greater respect for the \r\nrights of all peoples in the world, regardless of their \r\nplace of origin or what they have suffered.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe Cubans are proud of our African roots. The identity \r\nof the Cuban nation was the result of a process of \r\nacculturation that occurred with inputs from various \r\nethnic groups in difficult environments, first colonial, \r\nthen neocolonial. From 1959 onwards, a phase of true \r\nintegration began, where all the components of the \r\nCuban nation were given equal value. We are essentially \r\na blend of our Hispanic and African heritage. We have \r\nalso been influenced by Asia and the Native American \r\npeoples.\r\nIn Cuba as in several other countries in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, we can clearly see the \r\nconsequences of the transatlantic slave trade. The \r\ncolonial plantations of the island saw the arrival, as part \r\nof that cruel trade, of about 1,300,000 Africans. Those \r\nmen, women and children were snatched by force from \r\ntheir African villages and families and sold as slave \r\nlabour on the other side of the Atlantic.\r\nWith the passage of the centuries, Cuban culture \r\nand nationality arose, also nourished by our African \r\nheritage. Cubans are grateful to their African ancestors \r\nfor, among many other things, their wisdom, joy, \r\ncreativity and adaptability to adverse environments, \r\nthe richness of their history and religious beliefs, \r\nis incontestably and universally recognized, even if \r\nsometimes certain events arise to push us to forget or \r\nminimize it. It is important for us to briefly recall some \r\nhistorical facts that are universally recognized and \r\nwhich mark the contribution of Haiti in the liberation \r\nof humanity from slavery.\r\nFirst, as we said at the beginning, Haitian fighters \r\nwere in Savannah in 1779, fighting alongside American \r\ncombatants in their struggle for liberation. Among those \r\nheroes, we can cite Henry Christophe, Jean-Baptiste \r\nChavannes, Jean-Louis Villatte and André Rigaud, to \r\nname just a few. It is to pay tribute to those freedom \r\nfighters that the city of Savannah erected a memorial to \r\ntheir memory in October 2007.\r\nSecondly, in 1804, during an unprecedented \r\nrevolutionary war, we overthrew a colonial and slave \r\norder that was established on the island of Santo \r\nDomingo, which gave birth to the first black republic \r\nin the world. The island of Santo Domingo became \r\nthe Republic of Haiti. One should emphasize that \r\nimmediately after Haitian independence, hospitality \r\nand Haitian nationality were granted to all blacks \r\naround the world who were f leeing the slave order and \r\narrived on Haitian territory.\r\nThirdly, once independent, the generals of that era, \r\nincluding Alexandre Pétion, helped several fraternal \r\nLatin American countries in their liberation struggles \r\nby providing weapons, ammunition and soldiers. In \r\nrecognition of that support, some countries integrated \r\nthe colour red, which is one of the two colours of the \r\nHaitian f lag, into their national f lags. We would also \r\nlike to recall that the f lag of one Latin America country \r\nwas actually sewn in Haiti, and Simón Bolivar made \r\nseveral trips to Haiti.\r\nFourthly, during the Second World War, we granted \r\nhospitality to many peoples who were persecuted in \r\ntheir own homelands and elsewhere, including Jewish \r\npeople.\r\nFifthly, in the 1960s Haiti played a major role in the \r\ndecolonization of the Africa continent. Thus, among \r\nthe other efforts undertaken, it is important to recall \r\nthat many Haitian professors were sent to Africa.\r\nThe list is a long one.\r\nIn recalling those few historical facts, we do not \r\nwant to talk about past behaviour; rather, we want to \r\nrecall that Haiti has always moved forward with history \r\nand always played the role that history assigned to it. \r\n8/9 13-52279\r\nA/68/PV.35 21/10/2013\r\nUnited Nations and other international organizations, \r\nespecially UNESCO, in the matter. It is the minimum \r\nthat the international community can do to repair the \r\ncrime committed against humanity in the form of the \r\ntransatlantic trade that forced Africans into slavery.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on agenda item 120.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.7, entitled “Permanent memorial \r\nto and remembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nannounce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndocument A/68/L.7, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Andorra, \r\nArgentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, \r\nCameroon, Canada, Cape Verde, China, Cyprus, the \r\nCzech Republic, Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Estonia, \r\nFinland, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, \r\nIndonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ireland, Japan, \r\nLatvia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Norway, Paraguay, the \r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, the Republic of Moldova, \r\nRomania, the Russian Federation, Samoa, San Marino, \r\nSerbia, the Republic of Seychelles, Slovakia, Slovenia, \r\nSpain, Thailand, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia and Ukraine.\r\nThe President: May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt draft resolution A/68/L.7?\r\nDraft resolution A/68/L.7 was adopted (resolution \r\n68/7).\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the representative \r\nof Brazil.\r\nMrs. Almeida Watanabe Patriota (Brazil): \r\nBrazil can not overstress its thanks to Member States, \r\nthe United Nations and civil society for their tireless \r\nefforts in organizing and successfully accomplishing \r\nthe international competition to build the Permanent \r\nMemorial on United Nations premises in honour of \r\nthe victims of the transatlantic slave trade. That trade \r\nwas one of the worst tragedies, as it was the largest \r\nthe rhythm of their music, their energy in spirit and, \r\nessentially, their spirit of rebellion against injustice and \r\ntheir dauntless courage in the struggle for independence \r\nand freedom.\r\nFreed slaves and their descendants were the main \r\nactors in the various phases of the wars that made it \r\npossible for the Cuban people to exercise their self-\r\ndetermination. As the commander-in-chief of the \r\nCuban Revolution, Fidel Castro, said in his statement \r\nat the World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in \r\nDurban in 2001:\r\n“The inhuman exploitation to which the \r\npeoples of the three continents, including Asia, \r\nwere subjected affected the destiny and the daily \r\nlives of over 4.5 billion people living in third world \r\ncountries, whose poverty rates, unemployment, \r\nilliteracy, diseases, infant mortality, life \r\nexpectancy, and other innumerable calamities are \r\nimpossible to enumerate briefly, are shocking and \r\nhorrific. They are the contemporary victims of that \r\natrocity, which lasted for centuries, and clearly \r\ndeserve compensation for the horrendous crimes \r\ncommitted against their ancestors and peoples.”\r\nDeveloped countries and their consumer societies, \r\nwhich are responsible for the accelerated and nearly \r\nunstoppable destruction of the environment, have been \r\nthe main beneficiaries of conquest and colonization, \r\ntransatlantic slavery and human trafficking and the \r\nruthless exploitation and extermination of hundreds of \r\nmillions of children of the South. They have also been \r\nenriched through the unjust economic order oppressing \r\nhumankind and the international financial institutions \r\ncreated exclusively by them and for them. That rich and \r\nwasteful world possesses the technical and financial \r\nresources to pay its debt to humankind.\r\nCuba supports the just compensation request \r\nput forward by the States members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM). Cuba also demands the special \r\nand differentiated treatment that developing countries \r\nmerit and need, particularly the African countries, in \r\nterms of international economic relationships. Cuba \r\nrejects the shameful and selfish opulence of the few \r\nthat is guiding the ongoing globalization.\r\nCuba supports and co-sponsors the draft resolution \r\nthat is presented, each year, by the States members of \r\nCARICOM and the African Group. Cuba recognizes \r\nthe importance of strengthening the activities of the \r\n13-52279 9/9\r\n21/10/2013 A/68/PV.35\r\nand necessary path to achieve the broad education of \r\nthe public in order to raise awareness against prejudice, \r\nintolerance and racism. Brazil will endeavour to make \r\nevery necessary effort and work with Member States \r\nand partners towards the adoption of a draft resolution \r\non the international decade for people of African \r\ndescent, as mandated in paragraph 79 of resolution \r\n67/155.\r\nIn conclusion, Brazil would request the decisive \r\nsupport of Member States and the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to that end.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n120.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11 a.m.\r\nand longest-lasting crime ever committed against \r\nhumankind.\r\nBrazil commends the joint efforts of Member States, \r\nin particular the Permanent Mission of Jamaica, for its \r\nleadership of the Permanent Memorial Committee, in \r\nwhich Brazil proudly participates. Brazil is convinced \r\nthat the hour has come for the proclamation by the \r\nUnited Nations of the international decade for people \r\nof African descent.\r\nAs stressed by the representative of Jamaica, \r\nthe establishment of the Permanent Memorial is a \r\nmilestone; however, it is but a first step along the long \r\n"
