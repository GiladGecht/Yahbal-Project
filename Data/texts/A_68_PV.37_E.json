This event is particularly timely since this \r\nyear we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nAfrican Union and the tenth anniversary of the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM). My delegation would \r\nalso like to extend its appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for presenting the reports under consideration \r\ntoday.\r\nAs Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff stated \r\nduring her speech on the occasion of the African Union’s \r\ngolden jubilee in May in Addis Ababa, Brazil sees the \r\nAfrican continent as a brother and close neighbour. Our \r\nAfrican descent constitutes one of the strongest pillars \r\nof our culture and our national identity. Brazil’s support \r\nfor NEPAD reflects that awareness of our inextricable \r\nconnections to Africa.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s eleventh progress report on \r\nNEPAD (A/68/222) confirms that Africa is undergoing \r\nprofound economic and social transformations. Over the \r\nprevious year, encouraging developments continued to \r\nmaterialize in the fields of infrastructure development, \r\nagriculture and food security, health and education, \r\nand information and communications technology. In \r\naddition, the consolidation of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism has helped to strengthen mechanisms to \r\nidentify and put in place African solutions to African \r\nchallenges. In that regard, we wish to commend the \r\nNEPAD Agency, the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica, the African Union and the regional economic \r\ncommissions for their consistent efforts.\r\nWe need to recognize, however, that, despite the \r\nresilience shown by African economies, many challenges \r\npersist on the path to sustainable development. In many \r\ninstances, the chronic lack of resources for public \r\ninvestments hinders the full implementation of NEPAD \r\ndevelopment plans.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.37\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n37th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 25 October 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

To that \r\neffect, we have been working together with a number \r\nof African Governments in order to facilitate access to \r\ndrugs and treatment throughout the continent. In 2012, \r\nin partnership with the Government of Mozambique, \r\nthe Brazilian Government’s health foundation opened \r\na medicine factory in Maputo that has been producing \r\n21 types of antiretroviral drugs to combat HIV/AIDS. \r\nIt is expected that in two years, production will be \r\nsufficient to cater to the demand of the whole of \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. In that regard, it is essential that \r\nAfrican and other affected countries continue to be able \r\nto make full use of the f lexibilities in the World Trade \r\nOrganization Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects \r\nof Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), in accordance \r\nwith the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and public health.\r\nBrazil has also participated actively in United \r\nNations and NEPAD activities aimed at curing and \r\npreventing malaria, including the Roll Back Malaria \r\nPartnership. We have renewed our commitment to \r\ncooperating with African countries based on their \r\nown national experience in the control and elimination \r\nof malaria. At the bilateral level, we have continued \r\nto develop joint training and capacity-building \r\nprogrammes with a number of African countries for \r\nthe prevention and control of malaria and the overall \r\nstrengthening of national health systems.\r\nAll of those initiatives are underpinned by the \r\ncommitments made by African and South American \r\ncountries at the third Africa-South America Summit, \r\nheld in February in Malabo. On that occasion, nations \r\nfrom the two regions reaffirmed the urgency of \r\narticulating policies aimed at improving food security, \r\nincluding access to food. They also committed to \r\nbuilding a productive agenda focused on inclusive, \r\nsustainable economic growth and on prioritizing \r\nproduction by local small and medium-sized farms, \r\nwhile respecting their traditional methods. We also \r\nagreed on 27 different projects for implementation \r\nbetween our two regions in areas of common interest in \r\naddition to agriculture, such as education and culture, \r\ninfrastructure, peace and security, institution-building, \r\ngovernance and public administration, and trade.\r\nIn the area of international trade, African countries \r\nare faced with many structural barriers to their access \r\nto global markets. A lack of trade financing and the \r\nimposition of tariff and non-tariff barriers in developed-\r\ncountry markets, including trade-distorting subsidies, \r\ncontinue to prevent Africa from meeting its full export \r\npotential, especially in agriculture. In that regard, as \r\nwe approach the ministerial conference of the World \r\nTrade Organization to be held in Bali in December, we \r\nmust strive to ensure an outcome that is consistent with \r\nthe central role of agriculture for developing countries.\r\nThe continued decline in official development \r\nassistance (ODA) is another cause of concern when it \r\ncomes to African development initiatives. We call on \r\nall donor countries and development partners to fulfil \r\ntheir ODA commitments and to intensify support for \r\nNEPAD activities in order to sustain the momentum that \r\nhas been achieved, bearing in mind that Africa is the \r\nonly region that is not on track to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) by 2015.\r\nBrazil’s commitment to Africa’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment is permanent and unwavering. Our efforts \r\nto that effect have been concentrated on cooperation in \r\nthe areas of health and agriculture and food security, \r\nalways in accordance with the principles of South-South \r\ncooperation, such as non-conditionality and demand-\r\ndriven assistance. They have also included productive \r\ninvestments in a number of sectors.\r\nAs far as agriculture and food security are concerned, \r\nthe Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, \r\nEMBRAPA — a State enterprise — continues to provide \r\ntechnology and capacity-building through South-South \r\ncooperation to various African countries. Examples of \r\nongoing projects include the creation of community \r\nseed banks in South Africa, Mozambique and Namibia; \r\nfamily agriculture development in Malawi; cooperative \r\ndevelopment in Benin; and biotechnology laboratorial \r\nprocedures in Ghana. In addition, EMBRAPA also \r\nsupports the production of tropical fruit, cocoa, cotton, \r\nrice and horticulture in countries such as Senegal, \r\nTanzania, Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau and the Republic \r\nof the Congo, with a view to improving access to food \r\nand increasing food security and resilience.\r\nThrough the Ministry of Rural Development, the \r\nBrazilian Government is also transferring capacity \r\nto countries such as Zimbabwe, Kenya and Ghana to \r\nhelp them develop local versions of one of our national \r\nprogrammes, which provides finance for family-\r\n13-53103 3/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\ndoes go a long way towards ensuring the availability of \r\nmalaria-control commodities, as well as to consolidating \r\nand preventing a reversal of the gains that African \r\ncountries, particularly malaria-endemic countries, \r\nhave made. Like the rest of Africa, my country faces \r\nsevere resource constraints, which challenges our \r\nability to contribute from our local treasury. Therefore, \r\nby and large, the contribution of the global community \r\nhas gone a long way towards fostering the gains we \r\nhave made in malaria control. Continued support \r\nfor attaining meaningful and sustained progress is \r\ntherefore very much needed.\r\nAfrican countries and their Governments remain \r\ncommitted to malaria-control efforts, and Zambia, like \r\nmany malaria-endemic countries, has made remarkable \r\nreductions in malaria incidence and has embarked on \r\nan ambitious programme to eliminate it altogether, \r\nthrough the use of enhanced surveillance, the assured \r\navailability of commodities and, in particular, \r\nintegrated prevention and treatment interventions \r\nwithin communities.\r\nI am glad to report that by the end of 2012, 72 per \r\ncent of households in our country had at least one \r\nmosquito net, and that all our districts have now been \r\nincluded in indoor residual spraying efforts. Seventy-\r\nfour per cent of households have at least a net or have \r\nbeen sprayed against malaria. Of particular interest is \r\nthe fact that more than 72 per cent of pregnant women \r\nare receiving antimalarial prophylaxis.\r\nThose efforts have resulted in reductions in \r\nmalaria incidence and fatalities of about 66 per cent, \r\nthus contributing to Millennium Development Goal 6. \r\nUltimately, as it is for the rest of Africa, Zambia’s goal \r\nis to eliminate malaria, because we believe that is part \r\nof our development agenda, and the impact of malaria \r\ngoes way beyond the health sector. It is a basic social \r\nand development issue for most African countries.\r\nWhile noting those gains, Zambia, like most \r\nAfrican countries, has experienced some setbacks and \r\nchallenges in scaling up planned interventions, due to \r\nshortfalls in the co-financing of programmes, especially \r\nfrom the global health initiatives. My delegation \r\ntherefore calls for increased resources to be applied to \r\nresearch and surveillance to best inform malaria control \r\nefforts, to prevent the development of resistance to \r\ndrugs used in malaria control and to prevent resurgence \r\nwhere we have elimination within sight. In support \r\nof the Secretary-General’s report (A/68/222) and his \r\nWe also wish to highlight the importance of \r\nthe meeting held in March in Durban, South Africa, \r\nbetween African leaders and leaders of Brazil, Russia, \r\nIndia and China. The meeting focused on the potential \r\nfor cooperation on infrastructure projects, as well as \r\nfurther initiatives in the areas of health, agriculture and \r\nfood production, and the sharing of national experiences \r\nin the design and implementation of public policies \r\naimed at sustainable development and social inclusion.\r\nAll those initiatives are fully aligned with African \r\ndevelopment priorities and are geared towards giving \r\nrenewed strength to the ties between Africa and Brazil \r\nand South America as we strive to achieve all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and advance towards \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMr. Bweupe (Zambia): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for giving my delegation this opportunity to \r\ncontribute to the topic under discussion today.\r\nZambia wishes to align its statement with those \r\nmade this morning by the representatives of Ethiopia, \r\non behalf of the African Group, and Fiji, on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.36).\r\nMost of the development issues concerning the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development have been \r\nvery well articulated, particularly by Ethiopia, and \r\nour delegation would like to narrow the discussion \r\ndown to one key issue that affects our socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, namely, the agenda item on the Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, \r\nParticularly in Africa.\r\nMalaria remains a major public-health concern \r\nin Zambia, particularly among children under 5 and \r\npregnant women, with more than 4 million cases \r\nreported every year. My delegation would like to pay \r\nspecial tribute to the Secretary-General, as well as to \r\nthe global community, for the unprecedented support \r\nthat the fight against malaria has garnered in the past \r\ndecade, a contribution that the Director General of the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) highlighted in his \r\nrecent report (A/67/825) Like the other parts of Africa \r\nwhere malaria is seriously endemic, Zambia has been a \r\nbeneficiary of that unprecedented support.\r\nI wish to echo the concerns in the WHO report \r\non the shortfall in global financing for malaria \r\ncontrol, particularly the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria. We know that increased, \r\nsustained and predictable funding to the Global Fund \r\n4/15 13-53103\r\nA/68/PV.37 25/10/2013\r\nidentified thus far will also lead to improved regional \r\ncooperation and integration and boost intra-African \r\ntrade.\r\nLandlocked African countries are likely to \r\nexperience a reduction in transport costs, resulting from \r\nimproved access to seaports and improved infrastructure \r\nin transit countries. In that regard, progress has been \r\nmade in the project promoted by Algeria to complete \r\nthe trans-Sahara highway and gas pipeline, which will \r\nlink Algeria and Nigeria. In addition, the fibre-optic \r\ncomponent of the project linking Nigeria, the Niger \r\nand Algeria has also seen substantial progress, as \r\nevidenced by the installation of 700 kilometres of the \r\n2,700 kilometres of cable required. Significant progress \r\nhas also been made within the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme, which aims at \r\nachieving a 6 per cent growth rate in the agricultural \r\nsector through the allocation of 10 per cent of national \r\nbudgets. Today 30 countries have committed themselves \r\nto the programme, of which 21 have already adopted a \r\nnational agriculture investment plan.\r\nOn the topic of governance, NEPAD has successfully \r\nlaunched the African Peer Review Mechanism as a \r\nmeans of effectively fostering the adoption of policies, \r\nstandards and practices that lead to political stability, \r\nhigh economic growth, sustainable development and \r\naccelerated subregional and continental economic \r\nintegration. The Peer Review Mechanism, which this \r\nyear celebrates its tenth anniversary, has consolidated \r\nits position as a voluntary instrument for promoting \r\ngood governance. We are pleased to see today that \r\n33 countries have joined the Mechanism, of which 17 \r\nhave been peer-reviewed.\r\nAlthough progress has been made in the past \r\nyear in accelerating growth and social development, \r\npersistent challenges, including limited progress \r\ntowards the attainment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), linger. As such, sustained international \r\nsupport will be crucial if Africa is to meet those \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including and \r\nthrough a global partnership for development. To that \r\nend, we call on development partners to pursue efforts \r\nto deliver on their commitments to the continent’s \r\ndevelopment, including those relating to assistance. \r\nAll stakeholders need to make a strong push towards \r\nthe Goals in Africa, the only region that is unlikely to \r\nattain them by 2015. The launch of the United Nations \r\nmonitoring mechanism to review the implementation of \r\nobservations, we call for the consolidation of the gains \r\nmade by maintaining the aspirations of Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal 6 in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and ensuring that the eradication of malaria \r\nremains a priority global health issue.\r\nMr. Moktefi (Algeria): Allow me, at the outset, to \r\nwelcome Mr. Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki, Chief Executive \r\nOfficer of the Planning and Coordinating Agency of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nAlgeria also welcomes the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on NEPAD (A/68/222) and the insights it \r\nprovides.\r\nMy delegation wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Ethiopia on behalf of the African Group (see \r\nA/68/PV.36).\r\nThis year, the golden jubilee celebration of the \r\nestablishment of the Organization of African Unity, \r\nnow known as the African Union, provides us with an \r\nopportunity to take stock of what has been accomplished \r\nthus far and to look to the future with confidence. \r\nLaunched in Abuja in 2001 to spearhead the African \r\nrenaissance, the idea of NEPAD was born out of the \r\npolitical imperative for Africans to rely primarily on \r\nthemselves to lift the continent out of poverty and to \r\nput an end to the marginalization of Africa from the \r\nglobalization process. For that purpose, NEPAD has \r\nplaced the issues of peace, security, democracy, good \r\ngovernance, human rights, women’s empowerment and \r\nsound economic management at the heart of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWhile recognizing the political, economic and \r\nsocial difficulties that have beset Africa’s development \r\nfor decades, NEPAD is also an expression of Africa’s \r\nwill to establish a new partnership anchored in \r\nthe principle of African leadership and, above all, \r\nownership.\r\nAfter a decade of implementation, NEPAD, as a \r\nprogramme of the African Union, has produced a number \r\nof encouraging results. The promotion of infrastructure \r\ndevelopment as a driving force for Africa’s integration \r\nand development led to the adoption, in 2010, of the \r\nProgramme for Infrastructure Development in Africa \r\n(PIDA) by the African Union’s Heads of State. In \r\naddition to having a significant social impact, PIDA \r\nwill improve Africa’s competitiveness, strengthen its \r\npotential to attract investment and lead to a two-point \r\nincrease in growth. The major infrastructure projects \r\n13-53103 5/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\nand others issued by international conferences, \r\nespecially in the priority areas identified in NEPAD.\r\nThe various statements made over the course of \r\nthe week on Africa, along with the two reports just \r\nmentioned, reassure us that African countries are \r\nengaged in a process of profound changes in their \r\neconomies. Despite the global economic and financial \r\ncrisis, we must look at the indicators. We can see that \r\nthe strategic framework NEPAD offers has allowed \r\nAfrican countries to make encouraging progress. \r\nMoreover, African leadership has become apparent in \r\ntaking ownership of conflict resolution and in the will \r\nto avert conflict through use of African mechanisms.\r\nAfrica possesses the assets to make it an \r\nindispensable player whose weight will be felt in the \r\nglobalization of the world. However — and we cannot \r\nstress this enough — the countries of Africa face, \r\nindividually and collectively, multiple constraints that \r\nare often complex in nature, and they do not always \r\nhave the capacity to overcome them. \r\nAfrica’s destiny is linked to that of the whole world. \r\nThat is an undeniable fact and a reality that should \r\ninspire other regions of the world, and our bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners, to concrete actions and measures \r\nwithin a partnership framework that we envision as \r\ndynamic and innovative. My delegation shares the \r\nanalysis of the Secretary-General in his two reports, \r\nand I wish to align myself with his recommendations, \r\nin particular his emphasis on the need for our partners \r\nto keep their promises and honour their commitments \r\nand, above all, to continue to support the efforts of the \r\nAfrican countries and the African Union in their quest \r\nfor sustainable peace and development. \r\nThat is why the Congo welcomes the commitment of \r\nthe United Nations and of bilateral partners to work with \r\nthe Economic Community of Central African States to \r\nresolve the crisis in the Central African Republic. We \r\nhope that crisis comes to a happy conclusion, based on \r\nthe framework of rules established under the leadership \r\nof the Heads of State of the Economic Community of \r\nCentral African States, in close collaboration with the \r\nAfrican Union supported by the United Nations and \r\nthe bilateral partners. However, the political process \r\nthus undertaken in that country must be accompanied \r\nsimultaneously by actions to effect its economic \r\nand social recovery so as not to dash the hope for a \r\nlasting peace, learning lessons from the challenges \r\nthat prevented a successful outcome of earlier peace \r\nprocesses.\r\ncommitments made to the continent’s development is \r\nlikely to step up efforts towards that full delivery.\r\nWe know too well that the world’s prosperity cannot \r\nbe achieved without that of Africa. African efforts to \r\neradicate hunger, create jobs and ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment must be complemented by sustained \r\nsupport from developing partners. In that context, we \r\nurge the international community to give due attention \r\nto Africa’s priorities, in particular NEPAD, in the \r\nformulation of the post-2015 development agenda. A \r\nglobal partnership for development will be crucial for \r\naccelerating efforts to achieve the MDGs, in addition \r\nto enabling the implementation of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): Today’s debate \r\non agenda item 63 and its sub-items (a) and (b) is the \r\noutcome of the Africa-New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment Week. The Week, which also includes \r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), was \r\nmade possible thanks to the initiative of the Office of \r\nthe Under-Secretary-General and Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica and with valuable input from the Agency of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand the secretariat of the APRM. I would like first \r\nand foremost to express our sincere appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Maged Abdelaziz for the dynamism he \r\nhas brought to leading this Office, as well as to the \r\nExecutive Director of NEPAD’s Office of Planning and \r\nCoordination, Mr. Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki, who has \r\npromoted NEPAD with great conviction.\r\nI welcome that initiative, which has allowed us to \r\npresent an Africa that has overcome the weight of its \r\nhistory to take its destiny in hand, uniting around a \r\nshared vision of development — an Africa that has taken \r\nstock of the challenges of governance and of peace and \r\nsecurity so that the changes required to implement that \r\nvision can f lourish. \r\nMy delegation takes note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s two reports, entitled “New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development: eleventh consolidated progress \r\nreport on implementation and international support” \r\n(A/68/222) and “Causes of conflict and the promotion \r\nof durable peace and sustainable development in \r\nAfrica” (А/68/220). Both provide a thoughtful review \r\nof the actions undertaken or that should be undertaken \r\nby the United Nations and Africa’s other partners to \r\nassist Africa and the various pan-African institutions, \r\npursuant to the relevant General Assembly documents \r\n6/15 13-53103\r\nA/68/PV.37 25/10/2013\r\nintegration: between the Central African Republic \r\nand Chad along the Ouésso-Enyele-Мongoumba axis; \r\nCameroon through Ketta-Sembé-Souanké; Gabon \r\nalong the subregional axis of Doussala-Ndendé-\r\nDolisie, as well as through Okoyo-Lekoni-Franceville; \r\nAngola through Cabinda starting from Nzassi; and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo by the road-\r\nrail bridge from Brazzaville to Kinshasa and Ilebo.\r\nThe majority of those projects are being implemented, \r\nexcept the symbolic integrative project of the road-rail \r\nbridge that will eventually link Brazzaville to Kinshasa, \r\nwhich is still in the preliminary study phase. The same \r\napplies to the project to connect the electrical grids of \r\nCentral Africa.\r\nIt is commonplace to say that agriculture remains \r\nthe structural support of African economies due to its \r\nhigh rate of employment — 90 per cent in rural areas, \r\nand 60 per cent of the combined total for urban and \r\nrural areas. The development of that sector, however, \r\ncontinues to represent a challenge for my country. The \r\nCongo joined the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture \r\nDevelopment Programme (CAADP) in 2010, but it has \r\nnot yet managed to allocate 10 per cent of its budget \r\nto agriculture, as stipulated in the Maputo Declaration. \r\nThe Government has nonetheless embarked on a policy \r\nfor developing that sector. The Congo participated in \r\nsigning the regional framework in Libreville in April \r\n2013. The signing of the National Pact for the CAADP \r\nwill take place next month. A dossier will be presented \r\nto the partners in which they commit to improving \r\nthe macroeconomic and business frameworks and to \r\nconstructing adequate infrastructure. \r\nIn order to implement those programmes, the \r\nCongolese Government intends to improve the \r\nutilization of its own revenues while relying on external \r\nresources, in particular commitments made in the \r\nframework of certain initiatives, such as the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative and the initiative on \r\nthe transparent management of petroleum resources, \r\nwhich should enable the Congo to increase its capacity \r\nto mobilize external resources at favourable rates.\r\nAs we work on the development of the post-2015 \r\nagenda and sustainable development goals, it seems \r\nappropriate to underscore the need to see the two \r\nprocesses as mutually reinforcing and complementary \r\nin a coherent and coordinated manner, without, \r\nhowever, sacrificing the development goals that will not \r\nbe realized, for there are many African countries that \r\nwill not have attained the Millennium Development \r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto stress the importance of and interest in such \r\npartnerships, in which the United Nations and Africa’s \r\nother partners are called upon to support efforts and \r\ninitiatives at the regional and subregional levels, \r\nincluding the prevention and resolution of conflicts \r\nfrom the perspective of priorities defined by African \r\ncountries, the African Union and regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, particularly in post-conflict \r\nsituations. \r\nThe countries of Africa have never shirked \r\ntheir primary responsibility, aware that the future \r\nof the continent requires them to be masters of their \r\nown fate. The strength of that commitment has led \r\nthem, collectively and individually, to overcome \r\nadverse events and obstacles and to persevere in the \r\nimplementation of NEPAD, particularly in the light \r\nof the outcomes, however modest, that have been \r\nachieved in the past decade, as well as the lessons \r\nthey have learned, which have enabled them to bring \r\nhope to millions of Africans and to become a viable \r\npartner. That sustained dynamism has made possible \r\nthe remarkable progress we welcome today.\r\nWith that perspective, the Government of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo has developed its National \r\nDevelopment Programme 2012-2016, which is under \r\nway as part of the extension of a voluntary policy \r\nof integration by undertaking relevant programmes \r\nestablished under the priorities of NEPAD. The \r\nProgramme is based on five pillars, among which \r\ngovernance is rightly considered the cornerstone \r\nof economic and social development. The Congo \r\nhas subscribed to the process of self-evaluation and \r\nevaluation by the African Peer Review Mechanism \r\nfrom its launching in 2003. Internal consultations are \r\nunder way with a view to complying with that process. \r\nProgress towards good governance has become \r\nirreversible. \r\nDiversification and growth, social development and \r\ninclusion, and balanced and sustainable development are \r\nthe other pillars that guide the National Development \r\nProgramme. The development of economic and social \r\ninfrastructures is the pivot, because the services they \r\ngenerate make possible, inter alia, the interconnection \r\nof operators with internal, regional and international \r\nmarkets and ending the isolation of pockets of poverty.\r\nIn the context of interconnecting the neighbouring \r\ncountries of the subregion, the Congo has supported \r\na number of important efforts aimed at regional \r\n13-53103 7/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\nprosperity, which have been the leitmotif of its leaders \r\nsince the dawn of time.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for the great deal \r\nof information has has provided over the past 12 months \r\nwith regard to the support of African countries, their \r\nstrategic partners and the United Nations system in the \r\nNEPAD priority areas.\r\nOn the issue of infrastructure, we agree with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s statement in paragraph 111 \r\nof his report that the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa holds the key to pan-\r\nAfricanism and an African renaissance. The various \r\nprojects envisaged, including in the priority sectors \r\nof transport, energy, information and communications \r\ntechnology, and transboundary transportation, are \r\nclearly detailed in the report. They are of great \r\nrelevance for development of Africa and are in various \r\nstages of planning, programming and implementation. \r\nWe strongly support them. \r\nIt is important to underscore that such projects \r\nbroadly rely on funding from Africa, demonstrating \r\nthat, as African leaders have always asserted, the \r\nprimary responsibility for the development of the \r\ncontinent belongs primarily to them. Cameroon \r\nsupports in particular projects relating to roads, \r\nbridges, telecommunications and African integration \r\nat the national, regional and subregional levels. Our \r\ncountry, for its part, has committed to a broad national \r\nprogramme called Great Achievements, including the \r\nconstruction of ports, power stations and hydroelectric \r\ndams, roads, and new and renewable energy \r\ninfrastructure.\r\nWith regard to agriculture and food security, \r\nthe Secretary-General notes that African countries \r\ncontinue to make progress in implementing the \r\ncommitments made under the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme and the objective \r\nof allocating 10 per cent of their budgets to agricultural \r\ndevelopment. Our country is firmly committed to \r\nthis path through various projects planned or being \r\nimplemented. In his report, the Secretary-General \r\nidentifies challenges that prevent significant progress \r\nby Africa, in particular the lack of funds and the \r\nlimitations in technological capabilities. We call for the \r\novercoming of those challenges.\r\nWith regard to health, the Secretary-General notes \r\nthat progress has been slow with regard to the target \r\nset in the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS of allocating \r\nGoals by 2015. Likewise, it is important that the goals \r\nwe are shaping now reflect the priorities of NEPAD and \r\nof Africa.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in French): \r\nWe have read with great attention and sustained interest \r\nthe reports of the Secretary-General before us today \r\nunder sub-items (a) and (b) of agenda item 63. \r\nAt the outset, we associate ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered on behalf of the African Group on \r\nthese reports (see A/68/PV.36). \r\nWe wish to commend the Secretary-General for the \r\npriority he continues to grant to Africa, in the light of \r\ndecisions taken by the deliberative bodies of the United \r\nNations. We appreciate the foresight, dynamism, \r\nzeal and dedication shown by the President of the \r\nAfrican Union Commission, the Secretary-General’s \r\nSpecial Adviser on Africa, the Executive Secretary \r\nof the Economic Commission for Africa, the head of \r\nthe African Development Bank, the Chief Executive \r\nOfficer of the Planning and Coordinating Agency of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nand their teams in the service of development in Africa, \r\nespecially in making short-, medium- and long-term \r\nprojections, including up to 2063.\r\nWith regard to the reports before us and to agenda \r\nitem 13, we would like to make the following comments \r\nand observations. \r\nFirst, with regard to the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, it should be stressed, as affirmed \r\nby the Secretary-General himself, that the various \r\ncontinental f lagship programmes being implemented \r\nunder NEPAD, including those on infrastructure, \r\nagriculture and governance, are key to realizing the \r\nvision of an integrated, prosperous and peaceful \r\ncontinent. The eleventh report of the Secretary-General \r\non NEPAD (A/68/222) provides an update on progress \r\nin the implementation of, and international support to, \r\nthe NEPAD programme, which is celebrating its tenth \r\nanniversary at the same time as we mark the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the Organization of \r\nAfrican Unity, the predecessor of the African Union. \r\nIt is right that this occasion is being celebrated in the \r\ncontext of pan-Africanism and the African renaissance. \r\nFor those who can recall, our continent has come a long \r\nway since the period of slavery, colonialism and, more \r\nrecently, structural adjustments and the Afro-pessimism \r\nof the 1980s. The continent rose from the ashes of all \r\nof those trying episodes and is regaining its unity and \r\n8/15 13-53103\r\nA/68/PV.37 25/10/2013\r\nanother and with the rest of the world through broadband \r\nfibre-optic submarine cables, and the e-Schools \r\ninitiative, intended to equip all primary and secondary \r\nschools with information and communications \r\ntechnology. African countries have made commendable \r\nprogress in that regard, including in the areas of the \r\nprotection of intellectual property and information and \r\ncommunications technology governance. Our country \r\nis working with the relevant national authorities to \r\ndevelop an extensive programme and projects related to \r\ninformation communications and technology. \r\nNevertheless, as the Secretary-General emphasizes, \r\nsince Africa is a diverse continent with many languages, \r\ntraditions and customs, solutions must be adapted to \r\nspecific countries’ markets, and the African Union \r\nmust receive support to create an attractive regional \r\nhome for the pan-African Internet community and the \r\nGovernmental Advisory Committee of the Internet \r\nCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\r\nWith regard to science and technology, the report \r\nhighlights NEPAD’s efforts to forge partnerships and \r\nutilize them to promote innovation in Africa through \r\nregional networks of centres of excellence in biosciences \r\nand African indicators for science, technology and \r\ninnovation. We support those efforts and emphasize all \r\nthe initiatives undertaken by Cameroon at the national \r\nlevel through the Ministry of Scientific and Technical \r\nResearch and Innovation.\r\nWith regard to gender equality, women’s \r\nempowerment and the participation of civil society, \r\nthe Secretary-General highlights the important \r\ncommitments made  by African Governments in various \r\ninternational instruments and the encouraging progress \r\nin honouring those commitments. Cameroon is in \r\nthe vanguard here as well, with respect to ensuring \r\nthe rights of women, children and the disabled and \r\nthe participation of civil society, including youth, in \r\ndevelopment, for which purpose a national agency has \r\nbeen established.\r\nRegarding the African Peer Review Mechanism, \r\nthe Secretary-General notes that it has continued to \r\nstrengthen and institutionalize good political and \r\neconomic governance and business management in \r\nAfrica. Thirty-three countries, including Cameroon, \r\nhave acceded to the Mechanism, 17 of which have \r\nalready been reviewed. Democracy, good governance \r\nand respect for human rights are increasingly better \r\ndefended in Africa, thanks to the Mechanism, the \r\nPeace and Security Council of the African Union and \r\n15 per cent of national budgets to improving the health \r\nsector. However, many African countries, such as \r\nCameroon, have made remarkable progress in the fight \r\nagainst the HIV/AIDS, malaria and other infectious \r\ndiseases. The Chantal Biya Foundation — she is the \r\nFirst Lady of our country — and the African Synergies \r\norganization, which she set up together with other \r\nAfrican First Ladies, are at the forefront of these \r\nefforts. As emphasized by the Secretary-General, the \r\nmost urgent challenges that must be dealt with in order \r\nto step up progress in the health sector are the lack \r\nof training of qualified staff, international migration, \r\nmorbidity and premature mortality.\r\nOn education and training, the Secretary-General \r\nnotes that African countries have made significant \r\nefforts and achieved significant progress, in particular \r\nin primary and secondary education, especially for \r\ngirls. Our country is among the leaders in this field. As \r\nhe points out in paragraph 38 of his report, regarding \r\nchallenges, African Governments must continue to \r\npromote education policies that better prepare students \r\nwith the right skills and opportunities for decent \r\nemployment.\r\nWith regard to the environment and tourism, \r\nAfrican countries have also made progress in areas \r\nsuch as the fight against soil degradation and drought \r\nand desertification, and in wetland conservation \r\nand protected areas, as well as transboundary water \r\nmanagement and management of natural resources. \r\nThe continent has seen an increase of approximately \r\n52 million tourists, as noted by the Secretary-General. \r\nOur country doubled its share of tourists during the \r\nreporting period.\r\nTo consolidate that progress, especially in terms \r\nof the environment, African countries must receive \r\na fair share of environmental programme funding, \r\nin particular in those relating to forests. Need we \r\nemphasize yet again that the Congo Basin is the second \r\nlargest forest reserve in the world, after the Amazon, \r\nand that countries that have such reserves, such as \r\nCameroon, are contributing to the best interests of \r\nhumankind in terms of climate, biodiversity, economy \r\nand other so-called global goods? We must therefore \r\nensure that such goods can be enjoyed and obtain due \r\nrecompense from sharing them with humankind.\r\nI shall now turn to information and communications \r\ntechnology. In his report, the Secretary-General noted \r\nthe two major NEPAD objectives in that connection, \r\nnamely, connecting all African countries with one \r\n13-53103 9/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\nintegration of African countries into the global economy \r\nthrough dealing with the structural and infrastructure \r\nbarriers that impede their participation in international \r\ntrade.\r\nFinally, we support all the conclusions and \r\nrecommendations made  by the Secretary-General in his \r\nreport, in particular that asking donors to honour their \r\ncommitments to Africa and the one on creating a United \r\nNations mechanism responsible for following up on \r\ncommitments made for the development of Africa. The \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\non Africa, which will serve as the secretariat of that \r\nmechanism, should be strengthened. We support the \r\nSecretary-General’s proposals on this subject, which \r\nwill be considered by the Fifth Committee.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General on the causes \r\nof conflict and the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa (A/68/220) provides \r\nan update on the issue by focusing on the major \r\ndevelopments that occurred during the past 12 months \r\nin Africa, and on the efforts and activities undertaken \r\nto strengthen cooperation, conflict prevention and \r\nmanagement, peacekeeping and peacebuilding, \r\nreconstruction in the aftermath of conflict, human \r\nrights, the rule of law, the administration of justice, \r\nsupport for the reform of the security sector, and \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration. All \r\nthese activities clearly show that our continent is still \r\naffected by turmoil, ideological rivalries and the great \r\ndiversity of its interests.\r\nThe current situation in the Central African \r\nRepublic deserves particular attention with a view \r\nto preventing that brotherly country — which the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission was already dealing \r\nwith — from getting bogged down again in an acute \r\ncrisis with various repercussions for our subregion \r\nand the African continent in general. The countries \r\nof Central Africa and the African Union have taken \r\nimportant measures to safeguard peace and to return to \r\nconstitutional order in that country. \r\nCameroon actively contributes to those measures, \r\nas evidenced by, among other things, the participation \r\nof a contingent from our country in peacekeeping \r\nefforts in Central Africa and the recent appointment \r\nof a Cameroonian general to lead the African-led \r\ninternational support mission for the Central African \r\nRepublic. We call for and welcome the efforts and \r\nsupport provided, or to be provided, by the United \r\nNations and other partners for peace and development \r\nvarious measures taken by African Governments at the \r\nnational, subregional and continental levels.\r\nThe series of commitments and the progress on the \r\npart of Africa, which the Secretary-General notes in his \r\nreport, and in the various areas I have just mentioned, \r\nhave not met with firm and reciprocal commitments on \r\nthe part of the international community. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral deplores several shortcomings, including the \r\nf low of development aid to the continent, which has \r\nremained below the level of the promises made. The \r\nnumber of traditional donors — a source of capital for \r\nAfrica — continues to fall. \r\nThe debt burden of African countries continues to \r\ndecline. Foreign direct investment and other private \r\nf lows increased slightly but are concentrated in a \r\nfew countries and in the extractive industries, while \r\nAfrican priorities for industry are aimed at the rapid \r\ntransformation and enhancement of the added value of \r\nprimary products in all African countries. \r\nAid-for-trade resources allocated to Africa have \r\ndeclined. In this somewhat bleak picture, encouraging \r\nsigns have appeared in Africa’s cooperation with some \r\nof its strategic partners, especially new emerging \r\ncountries, in particular those of the South. The same \r\nis true of cooperation in the Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development process, with \r\nthe announcement by Japan of new funding and with \r\nChina, the Republic of Korea, India, Brazil, Turkey and \r\nthe United States also announcing comprehensive or \r\nsector-specific funding. The fact remains that all these \r\nfunds must materialize in order not to repeat the pattern \r\nof earlier promises that have yet to be fulfilled. It is \r\nwell understood that African countries should make \r\nevery effort to ensure aid effectiveness, as agreed at the \r\nconferences held in Paris and the more recent ones held \r\nin Busan, Republic of Korea.\r\nThe support provided by the United Nations entities \r\nis as diverse as the entities themselves and is focused on \r\ntheir respective areas of competence. We welcome all \r\nsuch contributions and hope that their coverage in future \r\nreports of the Secretary-General will include a critical \r\nanalysis based on a projected matrix that defines, ahead \r\nof time, the nature, objectives and eventual amounts of \r\neach of the expected contributions, validated according \r\nto an implementation time table.\r\nWith respect to trade, the Doha Round of \r\nnegotiations should be concluded as soon as possible \r\nand should adopt recommendations supporting greater \r\n10/15 13-53103\r\nA/68/PV.37 25/10/2013\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to interact in the consideration of the \r\nSecretary-General’s very interesting reports on \r\nsub-items (a) and (b) of agenda item 63 (A/68/222 and \r\nA/68/220). We appreciate the opportunity to deliberate \r\non matters of great importance to our region.\r\nFirst, my delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Ethiopia on \r\nbehalf of the African Group (see A/68/PV.36).\r\nThe economic and development challenges \r\nfacing Africa are indeed unique, and approaches \r\ndesigned to resolve them must lend credence to a \r\ndevelopment philosophy that takes due cognizance \r\nof local circumstances, recognizes the utilization of \r\nsubregional, regional and international mechanisms \r\nfor development, and uses a new paradigm in charting \r\na development path for Africa. Those challenges led \r\nto the creation of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) more than a decade ago, as \r\nAfrica’s blueprint, with an emphasis on ownership and \r\npartnership, geared to securing the economic renewal \r\nand development of the continent.\r\nNigeria reiterates that efforts should be directed \r\ntowards attaining the established targets for each of \r\nthe nine clusters identified by NEPAD, and calls on \r\nall African countries and their partners to build on \r\nexisting progress and fully align themselves with \r\nNEPAD’s operational blueprint. In that regard, we note \r\nthat failures of past development plans in Africa have \r\nhad less to do with the lack of effective frameworks and \r\nmore with haphazard implementation. My delegation \r\ntherefore commends the Economic Commission for \r\nAfrica, the African Development Bank, the United \r\nNations development partners and other regional players \r\nfor their efforts to implement NEPAD’s programmes \r\nand objectives, and for providing technical and other \r\nspecialized services to member States.\r\nSince NEPAD’s inception, there has been renewed \r\nconfidence that through its ongoing strategies, Africa \r\nwill be able to resolve its development challenges. It is, \r\nhowever, imperative to ensure that its broader mandate \r\nremains in focus. In that regard, divergent interests \r\nmust be supplanted by the collective, and member \r\nStates’ commitments to successful partnership must \r\nremain unwavering. \r\nNigeria stresses the need for individual States to \r\nstrive harder to mainstream the development agenda \r\ninto their sectoral programmes, using regional blocs \r\nin Central Africa, following the recent appeal and \r\nmeasures taken or envisaged for the Central African \r\nRepublic by the countries of the community of Central \r\nAfrican States.\r\nBeyond that, and in the Gulf of Guinea as a whole, \r\npiracy and armed robbery have seen something of a \r\nresurgence. It was in order to counteract that phenomenon \r\nthat, at the urging of the Security Council, the countries \r\nof West and Central Africa met in Cameroon on \r\n24 and 25 June and adopted some significant measures, \r\nincluding the creation of a centre for interregional \r\ncoordination based in Yaoundé. Arrangements are \r\nunder way to have the centre up and running as soon \r\nas possible. We will need the cooperation of the United \r\nNations and other international partners in order to \r\nstrengthen its effectiveness.\r\nConcerning the Decade to Roll Back Malaria \r\nin Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa, the \r\nefforts of African countries, which are evaluated \r\nquarterly by the Steering Committee of the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance, continue to have appreciable \r\nresults. Our country is once again in the front line in \r\nterms of policymaking, as well as with robust measures \r\nimplemented by the Ministry of Public Health. It should \r\nbe emphasized that prevention is always better than \r\ncure, and to that end, indoor spraying of homes and free \r\ndistribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets are \r\nvaluable assets in the fight against malaria. Nonetheless, \r\nthe African and world scientific community must \r\ncontinue to work determinedly to find an effective \r\nvaccine against this scourge as soon as possible, with \r\nthe level of commitment that Africa itself has shown in \r\nthe quest to definitively eradicate malaria.\r\nAs officials of NEPAD, the Economic Commission \r\nfor Africa and the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica put it so aptly in their joint publication of August \r\n2012:\r\n“The next decade of development in Africa must \r\nbe driven by renewed efforts towards increasing \r\nownership and maximizing Africa’s own internal \r\npotential, resources and talents for the continent’s \r\ndevelopment. Many challenges and opportunities \r\nlie ahead. Africa will only succeed if it continues \r\non its path of comprehensive political and \r\nsocioeconomic reforms, hinged on the core values \r\nof strong African ownership, leadership and \r\nvalue-driven partnership.” (Africa’s Decade of \r\nChange: Reflections on 10 Years of NEPAD, p. viii)\r\n13-53103 11/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\nduring its campaign for a non-permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council during the past week. There is no \r\ndoubt that the prevention of conflict is a cheaper option \r\nfor maintaining peace and security in the world. Indeed, \r\nit is becoming evident that the prevention of conflict \r\nis the best way to preserve the gains of development. \r\nThere is, therefore, a need to continue to give new \r\nimpetus to all conflict-prevention strategies.\r\nPoverty is both a cause and an effect of conflicts \r\nin Africa and remains a global challenge, since the \r\neffects transcend African frontiers. It is therefore the \r\nresponsibility of all to engage as positive catalysts in \r\nactualizing a conflict-free Africa, in order to ensure \r\nthat the achievements so far recorded in the region are \r\nfurther consolidated. In that regard, we commend the \r\nefforts of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) in reconstructing post-conflict countries and \r\nproviding credible transition and exit strategies. We also \r\ncall for the continued financial and institutional support \r\nof the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nMoving to the next issue on the agenda, which is \r\nthe health-related sector, we note that malaria remains \r\na major public health and development challenge in \r\nAfrica, as well as in Nigeria. However, we have fully \r\nembraced the unique opportunities to scale up malaria-\r\nrelated interventions, strengthen our systems and make \r\na major effort to roll back that disease. \r\nIn our commitment to accelerate and intensify \r\nefforts on malaria control, the Federal Government of \r\nNigeria launched the National Malaria Strategic Plan \r\n2009-2013 for malaria control, which was developed \r\nby the National Malaria Control Programme, together \r\nwith the partners of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, \r\nstate governments and other stakeholders. The Malaria \r\nStrategic Plan addresses national health development \r\npriorities, including the Roll Back Malaria Global \r\nStrategic Plan 2005-2015 and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The Malaria Strategic \r\nPlan is organized around a balanced package of \r\npreventive medicine services to reduce the disease \r\nburden and curative services to care for the sick. \r\nThe Plan also addresses the stated priority of a rapid \r\nscale-up of prevention interventions to decrease the \r\ninfection burden and to rapidly decrease the costs of \r\ncurative care in terms of drug costs, health capacity \r\noperations and household expenditure. \r\nNigeria has also commenced the development of \r\na new Malaria Strategic Plan for 2014-2020, whose \r\nemphasis is on malaria elimination. We also wish to \r\nas tools for continental economic integration. Nigeria \r\ntherefore commends the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States and its member States for their \r\nvarious contributions, which culminated in the signing \r\nin 2009 of the first regional agricultural compact. We \r\nbelieve that such positive steps can be replicated in \r\nother subregions and meshed into the larger continental \r\nproject.\r\nIt has been recognized worldwide that NEPAD \r\nstands on the planks of good governance, capacity-\r\nbuilding and partnership. In order to generate the \r\nmomentum required to guarantee steady progress \r\ntowards implementation of the partnerships’ objectives, \r\nwe must not lose sight of the need to boost the continent’s \r\ncapacity to govern and to develop long-term policies \r\nand strategies.\r\nWhile we acknowledge that much progress \r\nhas been made in implementing NEPAD priority \r\nsectors, we believe that more remains to be done \r\nwith regard to the NEPAD agenda, particularly in \r\nthe area of infrastructure and development. Nigeria \r\ntherefore welcomes the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa and the implementation of the \r\nPresidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative. We \r\nbelieve that the infrastructural deficit is one of the \r\nfactors responsible for the failure to attain of many \r\nof our objectives for development in Africa. Nigeria \r\nis firmly of the view that NEPAD’s goals of building \r\nstrong economic infrastructures and creating a \r\nfavourable environment for investment remain crucial. \r\nIt is through that approach that Africa can be pulled out \r\nof its current economic difficulties in order to enable it \r\nto prosper, as it rightly should. \r\nWith regard to sub-item (b), much has been said \r\nabout the inextricable link between durable peace and \r\nsustainable development in Africa. A continent as \r\ndiverse as Africa can best realize partnership when \r\nrancourous impediments give way to lasting peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\nMy delegation recognizes that conflict, no matter \r\nwhat its size, poses serious challenges to the proper \r\nintegration of African States, as it hampers the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the NEPAD goals. My \r\ndelegation calls for the continued utilization of the \r\ncontinent’s early-warning system aimed at preventing \r\nconflicts. In addition, Member States should embrace \r\nan effective mechanism to mediate between conflicting \r\ninterests. It is for that reason that Nigeria chose the \r\ntheme of advocating preventive diplomacy for peace \r\n12/15 13-53103\r\nA/68/PV.37 25/10/2013\r\nMost importantly, there was renewed commitment \r\nby African leaders to addressing those diseases and \r\npromoting health and well-being in Africa. The Federal \r\nGovernment has a special interest in malaria elimination \r\nand is determined to continue pursuing a framework \r\nthat will give the necessary support to ensure the \r\nelimination of the disease and the achievement of the \r\nMDGs and their relevant targets. \r\nFinally, other issues raised in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report are of great interest to Nigeria and have \r\neither been addressed in Committee meetings or will be \r\ntaken up at appropriate meetings in order to elaborate \r\non their importance and the actions being taken at the \r\nnational level to implement them competently and in a \r\nstructured manner. \r\nMr. Kaganda (United Republic of Tanzania): It is \r\nan honour for the United Republic of Tanzania to address \r\nthe Assembly on this important day for Africa — a day \r\non which we celebrate not only the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the Organization of African Unity and the African \r\nUnion, but also the tenth anniversary of the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism and the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme (CAADP). \r\nWe align ourselves with the statements delivered by \r\nthe representative of Ethiopia on behalf of Africa and \r\nby the representative of China on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China (see A/68/PV.36).\r\nAfrica has made considerable gains in strengthening \r\ngovernance. Efforts are ongoing to promote and \r\nreinforce further governance through the African Peer \r\nReview Mechanism (APRM) of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD). Similarly, many \r\nAfrican countries are now embracing democracy \r\nand the rule of law and promoting transparent public \r\nadministration. However, more work is needed to \r\nstrengthen the gains achieved in that area.\r\nAfrica still faces myriad challenges, some of which \r\nare chronic. Some areas of the continent are entangled \r\nin protracted conflicts that continue to claim the lives \r\nof thousands, while displacing millions and hampering \r\ndevelopment. Steadily, but surely, we are seeing the \r\npositive results of African solutions to those African \r\nchallenges. And we are committed to eradicating \r\nconflicts in the continent by addressing the underlying \r\ncauses.\r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania is among the \r\n31 African countries that have voluntarily acceded to \r\nthe APRM. In so doing, we undertook to promote and \r\ninform the Assembly that Nigeria was selected as one \r\nof the nine countries to pilot the Affordable Medicines \r\nFacility-Malaria. That project, which is managed by the \r\nGlobal Fund, receives financial support from the Joint \r\nUnited Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, the United \r\nKingdom’s Department for International Development \r\nand the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Its goal is \r\nto reduce the retail price of artemisinin combination \r\ntherapies to a point where they are as affordable as \r\nmany of the cheapest antimalarial monotherapies. We \r\nalso wish to inform the Assembly that the United States \r\nAgency for International Development has funded \r\nmalaria activities in Nigeria. \r\nIn 2011, Nigeria became a recipient country under \r\nthe President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) of the United \r\nStates Government. Through the years, we have \r\nreceived a total of $103.7 million in funding for 2011 and \r\n2012. The 2013 PMI operational plan for Nigeria was \r\ndeveloped during a planning visit, carried out in June \r\n2012 with the United States Agency for International \r\nDevelopment and the United States Centers for \r\nDisease Control and Prevention headquarters and field \r\nstaff. The Global Fund’s phase 2 has been targeted at \r\nprocuring 26 million long-lasting insecticide-treated \r\nnets, between 2011 and 2014, with a co-funding option \r\nfor about 10 million more such nets during that time \r\nframe. \r\nNigeria, along with other African countries, \r\nrecently adopted the African Union road map on shared \r\nresponsibility and global solidarity for HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria, based on the three pillars of \r\ninnovative financing, universal access to medicines and \r\ndiagnostics, and committed leadership and governance. \r\nWe will continue to play an active role in vigorously \r\nsupporting the objectives of the road map and their \r\nbeneficial advancement.\r\nIn line with our unwavering commitment to \r\nmultilateral action in the fight against malaria and other \r\ndiseases, Nigeria hosted the Special Summit of the \r\nAfrican Union on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, \r\nheld in Abuja in July 2013. Among other outcomes, the \r\nSummit was able to review the level of achievement \r\nof the targets set at the 2001 and 2006 African Union \r\nmeetings, identify gaps, constraints and challenges \r\nrelating to the achievement of the Abuja Declaration on \r\nHIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious \r\nDiseases and the MDG targets and also identify new \r\nstrategies that will enable Africa to chart a new and \r\nmore realistic course towards achieving those targets. \r\n13-53103 13/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\nIt is a leading killer of children and pregnant women, \r\nwho are dying every day.\r\nMalaria control remains a global emergency — even \r\nmore so for Africa. Malaria-control interventions \r\npositively impact overall child and maternal mortality \r\nrates and could help in reaching the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals — particularly Goals 4 and 5, \r\nconcerning reducing child mortality and improving \r\nmaternal health, respectively — by 2015. That is why \r\nmy Government has implemented several interventions \r\nto address the disease.\r\nMy country has succeeded in reducing malaria \r\nprevalence in young children by 44 percent between \r\n2008 and May 2012. In Zanzibar, death due to malaria \r\nis near zero. Our challenge in Zanzibar is to sustain \r\nthat achievement. As for mainland Tanzania, we are \r\nreplicating the lessons learned from the island of \r\nZanzibar, namely, residual spraying on malaria breeding \r\nsites; making available long-term insecticide-treated \r\nbednets for every bed; early treatment for those infected \r\nwith malaria and control and surveillance to prevent the \r\nre-emergence of the epidemic.\r\nOn the other hand, the Government has embarked \r\non an expensive comprehensive programme to deal with \r\nthe question of access to health care. The programme \r\nwill ensure that there is a dispensary in every village \r\nand a health-care centre in every ward. The programme \r\nwill certainly be instrumental in the success of our \r\nanti-malaria effort, as it will guarantee prompt diagnosis \r\nand treatment. In that endeavour, we need partnerships \r\nand support from the international community. We \r\nthank our bilateral and multilateral partners that have \r\nprovided us with financial and technical support. We \r\ncall for their continued support to complement the \r\nGovernment’s efforts in implementing the malaria \r\nstrategy and eradicating malaria in Tanzania.\r\nThe challenge facing the global community is to \r\nintensify efforts and commitments in order to avoid \r\nreversal of the gains made thus far, and to push for \r\ngreater progress in sustainable interventions. Many \r\nstrategies have been put in place to combat malaria. \r\nIn that regard, we recognize the work of the African \r\nLeaders Malaria Alliance to that end.\r\nWe have learned that the current strategies alone \r\nare unlikely to achieve the goal of eliminating the \r\ndisease. We also risk diminishing efficacy, due to \r\nthe development of drug resistance and insecticide \r\nresistance on the part of parasites and the anopheles \r\nprotect democracy and human rights by developing \r\nclear standards of accountability, transparency and \r\nparticipatory governance. We have submitted periodic \r\nreports to the Mechanism. Our first country report, \r\nissued early this year, records remarkable progress on \r\ndemocratic and economic governance and management. \r\nIt also notes the challenges that remain in translating \r\neconomic growth into broad-based, pro-poor and \r\ninclusive development. The Government has made a \r\ncommitment to the national programme of action as a \r\nway of implementing the APRM recommendations.\r\nOur main task consists of efforts to reduce \r\npoverty, inequality and youth unemployment and foster \r\ninclusive, transformative development. We believe we \r\ncan succeed. In doing so, we will count on all social \r\nactors and development partners in the spirit of NEPAD.\r\nIn celebrating the tenth anniversary of CAADP, we \r\nare reminded that agriculture is the backbone of most \r\nAfrican countries, including my country, Tanzania, \r\nwhere about 70 per cent of the population depends \r\non agriculture for its livelihood. In that regard, many \r\nGovernments have undertaken to increase investment \r\nin agriculture so as to increase crop productivity and, \r\nultimately, food security. My Government allocates \r\nalmost 10 per cent of the national budget to agricultural \r\ndevelopment and food security and has initiated several \r\npublic-private partnerships in that sector, taking full \r\nadvantage of the conducive investment climate in the \r\ncountry.\r\nAnother challenge for Africa is malaria. Since \r\n2001, when the General Assembly adopted its first \r\nresolution on malaria in Africa (resolution 55/284), we \r\nhave witnessed enhanced political commitment and \r\nglobal attention in the fight against malaria. At least \r\n11 African countries and 32 malaria-endemic countries \r\noutside Africa have reduced the number of confirmed \r\ncases of malaria recorded between 2000 and 2009 by \r\nmore than 50 per cent. Hundreds of thousands of lives \r\nhave been saved.\r\nDespite the fact that malaria is an entirely \r\npreventable and treatable disease, too many people \r\ncontinue to suffer and die from malaria. When 100 \r\npeople die in an accident, or in war, we are shocked. \r\nWe should, however, remember that in 2010 alone \r\nthe disease killed an estimated 660,000 people. In \r\nTanzania, malaria is a leading cause of inpatient and \r\noutpatient visits and deaths. Between 30 and 40 per \r\ncent of all outpatient visits are attributable to malaria. \r\n14/15 13-53103\r\nA/68/PV.37 25/10/2013\r\nthe principles and values of pan-Africanism and \r\nAfrican renaissance. It has been a year of acclamation \r\nof Africa’s accomplishments and of reaffirmation of \r\nits resolve to fulfil the vision of social progress for \r\nthe peoples of Africa through democratic governance \r\nand economic emancipation. It would therefore have \r\nbeen desirable that this historic moment be celebrated \r\nin peace to permit us to focus our attention on our \r\ndevelopment goals. That is an aspiration that we will \r\ncontinue to pursue with resolve.\r\nIn that regard, I welcome the two reports of the \r\nSecretary-General under consideration (A/68/220 and \r\nA/68/222) and would like to seize this opportunity to \r\nexpress our appreciation for his tireless efforts to uphold \r\nthe United Nations commitment to supporting Africa’s \r\nagenda for peace and sustainable development. I also \r\nwish to commend the Special Adviser on Africa for his \r\ncontinued engagement to generate effective support for \r\nAfrica and for undertaking the various initiatives that \r\nmarked the tenth anniversary of the New Economic \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development and the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism.\r\nSince the 1990s, Africa has been engaged in \r\na democratization process that, in its essence, is a \r\nrecognition that peace and stability can be sustained \r\nonly in an inclusive society. As a result, at this early \r\nstage of our democracies, the steps taken to modernize \r\nthe judicial system, the consolidation of the role of our \r\ncivil society and the culture of the rule of law in Africa \r\nis a clear and positive indication that we are indeed on \r\nthe right path.\r\nGalvanized by that belief and by the desire for peace, \r\nMozambique embarked on a democratization process \r\ninvolving a review of its Constitution in 1990 and 2004, \r\nfirst in order to introduce the essential principles for \r\nthe exercise of a multiparty democracy — namely, the \r\ndemocratic rule of law, the separation of powers and \r\npolitical pluralism — and, secondly, to reaffirm and \r\ndeepen those democratic principles. In that endeavour, \r\ncitizen participation in all spheres of life proved to \r\nbe an enabling tool for inclusive governance. Giving \r\na voice to the people is fundamental in a democratic \r\nsociety, as it allows them to be conscious participants \r\nin the national development process. In that regard, the \r\ndecentralization and devolution of decision-making \r\nprocesses undoubtedly contribute to fostering \r\nsocial inclusion and thus reinforce democracy and \r\nprevent conflicts. Similarly, strengthening integrity \r\nand transparency mechanisms to guarantee a fair \r\nmosquito, respectively. That is why, on 24 September, \r\nthe Multisectoral Action Framework for Malaria was \r\nlaunched. The Action Framework proposes broad \r\nadvances in human development and further joint action \r\nfrom global and sectoral ministries directed at village \r\nlevel. We call on Member States and the international \r\ncommunity to support that broad global effort.\r\nWe also take the opportunity to welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s selection of malaria as a priority \r\nof his five-year action agenda covering the period \r\n2012-2017. We believe that commitment will promote \r\nnew partnerships and improve existing ones, with \r\nthe aim of scaling up high-impact interventions and \r\nsignificantly reducing the number of malaria deaths.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to urge the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations to work more \r\nclosely and actively with the African Union in an effort \r\nto resolve the remaining conflicts and consolidate \r\npeace and security in Africa. We need to work together \r\nto ensure that malaria control and elimination remains \r\na key priority in the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nWe must also ensure sustained focus and attention \r\non strengthening health systems and human capacity \r\ndevelopment to enable malaria-endemic countries to \r\nimprove their overall response to the challenges.\r\nPermit me to conclude by reiterating our national \r\nmotto with respect to malaria: “Malaria is unacceptable; \r\nlet us join hands to eliminate it”.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique): As this is the first \r\ntime I take the f loor since the President assumed his \r\nfunctions as President of the General Assembly, allow \r\nme to start by warmly congratulating him and all \r\nmembers of the Bureau on their elections to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. \r\nI wish to reiterate the commitment expressed by His \r\nExcellency President Armando Guebuza in the general \r\ndebate (see A/68/PV.5) to render all our support to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for the successful \r\noutcome of this session. \r\nMozambique aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of Ethiopia on behalf of \r\nthe African Group and by the representative of Fiji on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/68/PV.36).\r\nThis joint debate is being held against the backdrop \r\nof the momentum created by the commemoration of the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the formation of the Organization \r\nof African Unity and the tenth anniversary of the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) — a celebration that has reaffirmed \r\n13-53103 15/15\r\n25/10/2013 A/68/PV.37\r\nreaffirmation of our national commitment to values and \r\nprinciples in political and economic governance.\r\nGood governance demands respect for basic human \r\nrights, from civil and political rights to economic, \r\nsocial to cultural rights — all inalienable rights \r\nembedded in our overarching goals of peace, stability \r\nand sustainable development. As we approach the \r\n2015 deadline for the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the uneven progress in attaining those goals, \r\nin particular in Africa, demands that special attention \r\nbe devoted to Africa’s needs. We should therefore \r\nstrengthen the momentum generated by the Decade to \r\nRoll Back Malaria and direct our efforts to measures \r\nthat go beyond the goal of malaria prevention. Malaria \r\nremains a great challenge to Africa’s efforts to achieve \r\nthe MDGs, as it has a direct impact on social and \r\neconomic structures, affecting the most vulnerable, in \r\nparticular children under the age of 5, pregnant women, \r\nsocially disadvantaged groups and people living with \r\nHIV/AIDS.\r\nTo address the scourge of malaria, as well the \r\nother challenges facing Africa, partnerships are of \r\nparamount importance. In that regard, we reiterate \r\nthe call made by the Secretary-General for the United \r\nNations system, Member States and other partners to \r\ncontinue to strengthen their support to and cooperation \r\nwith Africa.\r\nI would like to conclude by stressing that we are \r\nconfident that the engagement of Africa, coupled with \r\nthe commitment of partners such as the Group of 20, \r\nthe Group of Eight, Brazil, Russia, India, China, South \r\nAfrica and others to support Africa’s efforts to attain \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, will allow us to \r\nlook at the future of Africa with increasing hope and \r\noptimism.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on these items.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 63 and its sub-items (a) \r\nand (b) and agenda item 13.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.35 p.m.\r\ndistribution of resources, through improved access to \r\npublic goods and services such as education, health, \r\nsafe drinking water and job opportunities, adds to those \r\nnoble goals.\r\nAs part of its development agenda, Mozambique \r\nembarked on a decentralization and devolution process \r\nthat seeks to ensure a more inclusive and participatory \r\nrole for all stakeholders, including local communities. \r\nTo that end, the Government established, among other \r\nmeasures, the District Consultative Board, an institution \r\nthrough which local communities have a decisive role in \r\ngovernance. To further empower the communities, the \r\nGovernment also established an Annual Fund for Local \r\nDevelopment, commonly known as the Seven Million \r\nFund, to finance food production and initiatives that \r\nhave the potential to generate employment in rural and \r\nurban areas. Local communities are the sole managers \r\nof those initiatives. As a result, we have upheld the \r\nrule of law, promoted development and forged more \r\npolitically and economically empowered communities.\r\nWith the advent of multiparty democracy, the \r\nholding of multiparty democratic elections became part \r\nof our commitment to good governance and the rule of \r\nlaw. Unfortunately, progress in that area is challenged \r\nnot only by the scourges of poverty and disease, which \r\nregrettably continue to affect a substantial part of our \r\npopulation, but also by the occurrence of incidents that \r\nare disruptive in their nature and peculiar to countries in \r\npost-conflict situations. Our experience has shown that \r\npolitical dialogue and robust democratic institutions \r\nand processes represent the most sustainable solution \r\nto political instability. To that end, we will continue \r\nto use dialogue as the vehicle to nurture a democratic \r\nculture under which political forces learn to conform \r\nto democratic principles and rules. We also reiterate \r\nour commitment to building credible institutions that \r\ncan adequately address the challenges brought about by \r\ndemocratic governance in our particular context.\r\nIn addition, we will continue to count on the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism to address policy challenges, \r\ntaking advantage of its constructive and inclusive \r\ndialogue with all stakeholders. That is, without a doubt, \r\nanother instrument for confidence-building and for the \r\n"
