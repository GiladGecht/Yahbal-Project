"The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 40\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/116)\r\nDraft resolution (A/68/L.6)\r\nMr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): We welcome the participation in today’s \r\ndiscussion of Mr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General for his comprehensive report \r\n(A/68/116), which presents the views of Member \r\nStates condemning the unilateral and extraterritorial \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America on Cuba.\r\nRussia’s principled position is well known and \r\nremains unchanged. Our country, along with an \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community, \r\nsupports the immediate lifting of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade of Cuba by the \r\nUnited States. The ideologically motivated and decades-\r\nlong anti-Cuba embargo is a historical anachronism, \r\nan echo of the long-dead era of the Cold War. This \r\nunfriendly act, carried out in violation of numerous \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, inflicts serious damage \r\non Cuba’s national economy, infringes on its citizens’ \r\nlegal rights, worsens their living conditions and has a \r\nnegative impact on the interests of third-party countries.\r\nWe believe such damaging unilateral political \r\ncoercion to be incompatible with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and conducive to an atmosphere of \r\nincreased confrontation in international relations. \r\nIn that regard, on 22 October, the State Duma of the \r\nRussian Federation appealed unanimously to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the national parliaments of States \r\nMembers of the United Nations and international \r\nparliamentary organizations to help end the sanctions \r\nagainst Cuba. Expressing their solidarity with the \r\npeople of Cuba, Russia’s lawmakers emphasized \r\nCuba’s right to determine its own path to political and \r\neconomic development.\r\nGuided by the fundamental principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, based on the inadmissibility of \r\nany discriminatory action or interference in States’ \r\ninternal affairs, the Russian delegation supports the \r\ndraft resolution of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session (A/68/L.6) with its demand for abolition \r\nof the blockade imposed by the United States on Cuba.\r\nMr. Thomson (Fiji): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China on agenda item 40, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nI would first like to acknowledge the presence of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.38\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n38th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 29 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Such a goal requires that all nations adhere to \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\npeaceful conduct of relations among nations and the \r\nrule of law, including international law.\r\nWe recall that last year 188 Member States voted in \r\nfavour of the resolution introduced by the representative \r\nof Cuba (resolution 67/4). That number represented an \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community, \r\ndemanding an end to the five-decades-old embargo \r\nand full adherence to the principles of mutual respect \r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of a State \r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China will again fully support \r\nthe draft resolution against the embargo (A/68/L.6) and \r\nurges all Member States to do likewise.\r\nMr. Montaño (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): For \r\nmore than 20 years, Mexico has come to this forum to \r\nexpress its strong rejection of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba and to set out its opposition to \r\nthe use of coercive measures that are not supported in \r\nlaw.\r\nWe recognize the progress Cuba has made towards \r\nmeeting the targets established for the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals despite the negative impact of \r\nthe embargo, which over half a century has been the \r\nmain obstacle to the country’s further development and \r\ntherefore to improving the life of the people.\r\nThe Government of Mexico reiterates its firm \r\nrejection of the application of unilateral measures or \r\nlaws such as this economic embargo against any State. \r\nWe must underscore that what is occurring in Cuba \r\nf louts and goes against the stance of our countries. No \r\nkind of political, economic or military sanctions can \r\nbe imposed on a State except on the basis of decisions \r\nor recommendations by the Security Council or the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMexico and Cuba enjoy historic ties in a climate \r\nof renewed confidence, invariably observing the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, in particular peaceful coexistence. \r\nThe Group of 77 and China expresses its deep \r\nconcern about the continued economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo unilaterally imposed for more \r\nthan half a century by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. The Group of 77 and China reiterates that \r\nthe embargo against Cuba contravenes the fundamental \r\nnorms of international law, international humanitarian \r\nlaw, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and \r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States. \r\nIts continued application violates the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and of non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in one another’s domestic affairs.\r\nThe embargo continues to impose severe economic \r\nand financial restrictions on Cuba. It has caused and \r\ncontinues to cause a high degree of economic and \r\nfinancial damage. It has a negative impact on the welfare \r\nand well-being of the people of Cuba and constitutes \r\na very significant hindrance to Cuba’s economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nThe deepening impact of the ongoing global \r\neconomic and financial crisis and the continued \r\nembargo imposed by the Government of the United \r\nStates — which includes sanctions and the application \r\nof extraterritorial national laws against third-party \r\ncountries’ citizens, institutions and companies that \r\nestablish economic, commercial and financial relations \r\nwith Cuba — will contribute to further aggravating the \r\nCuban people’s hardships. Furthermore, the embargo \r\nfrustrates efforts to achieve all the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including the all-important \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and negatively affects \r\nregional cooperation in the area.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China has always been \r\nfirmly against the embargo. That position has been \r\nreiterated at its major summits, where the Group firmly \r\nhas rejected the imposition of laws and regulations \r\nwith extraterritorial impact and all other forms of \r\ncoercive economic measures, including unilateral \r\nsanctions against developing countries, and has called \r\non the United States Government to put an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would like to reiterate \r\nonce again its long-standing and principled position \r\non this important matter, and to recall the ministerial \r\ndeclaration of the thirty-seventh annual Meeting of the \r\nMinisters for Foreign Affairs of the Group, held in New \r\nYork in September. The Ministers firmly rejected the \r\nimposition of laws and regulations with extraterritorial \r\n13-53496 3/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations enshrines rights, \r\nobligations and principles that have become part of \r\nthe legal corpus not only of international law but of \r\nhumankind. It must not be violated or harmed by any \r\nMember. Member States must align their national and \r\ninternational behaviour with the rights, obligations and \r\nprinciples enshrined in our founding Charter. CELAC \r\nreiterates those principles, including the principles of \r\nthe sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs, freedom of trade \r\nand navigation, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed against Cuba began in 1959 and continues to \r\nthis day. Today, the embargo has become a rigid system \r\nof unilateral measures that has been extended over time, \r\ncreating severe economic losses for the Cuban people, \r\nwhich are felt in the most sensitive areas of their life. \r\nWe express our deep concern on the strengthening of \r\nthe extraterritorial dimensions of the embargo, as well \r\nas on the increasing persecution of Cuba’s international \r\nfinancial transactions, which is contrary to the political \r\nwill of the international community, as reflected in the \r\nresolution.\r\nCELAC reiterates the concern, already expressed \r\nin resolution 67/4, regarding the application by States \r\nMembers of the United Nations of laws and regulations \r\nsuch as the so-called Helms-Burton Act, the \r\nextraterritorial effects of which affect the sovereignty \r\nof other States and the legitimate interests of entities \r\nor persons under their jurisdiction, and the freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation. The unilateral measures applied \r\nunder the embargo imposed on Cuba are affecting \r\nmany companies that conduct business with Cuba in \r\naccordance with international law, including the norms \r\nestablished by the World Trade Organization. Over the \r\npast year, numerous restrictions and fines have been \r\nimposed on international companies, some of them \r\nbelonging to members of our Community.\r\nWe would like to recall that at the CELAC Summit \r\nheld in Santiago de Chile on 28 January, the member \r\nStates of our Community issued a special communiqué \r\non the need to put an end to the economic, trade and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba, in which they reiterated their strongest \r\ncondemnation of the application of laws and measures \r\ncontrary to international law, such as the Helms-Burton \r\nAct, including its extraterritorial effect, and called on \r\nthe Government of the United States to put an end to the \r\napplication of that Act.\r\nDuring his recent visit to Cuba, the Foreign Minister of \r\nMexico recognized the reform process in Cuba and the \r\nopportunities it presented for increasing investment, \r\nbilateral trade and cooperation programmes and for \r\ncontinuing our high-level political dialogue.\r\nThe Government of Mexico has reiterated its firm \r\nopposition to the economic, political and diplomatic \r\nisolation of Cuba. We therefore have decisively \r\nsupported Cuba’s incorporation into regional integration \r\nmechanisms with a view to promoting economic and \r\ntrade exchanges, cooperation and development.\r\nIn keeping with what I have said, and in a gesture \r\nof great significance for relations between our two \r\ncountries, Mexico will vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6 before us today. We believe that this is the \r\nleast we can do to bring to an end a deplorable state of \r\naffairs that has persisted for more than 40 years.\r\nMr. Gálvez (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): I have the \r\nhonour to address the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(CELAC) on the occasion of the introduction of draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.6, entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nSince the adoption of resolution 47/19 on \r\n24 November 1992, the General Assembly has \r\nsuccessively adopted, each year, a resolution \r\nemphasizing the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. It should be \r\nrecalled that at its sixty-seventh session, the Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 67/4 with the same title, with the \r\noverwhelming support of the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. Since 1992, 21 resolutions of the most \r\nrepresentative and democratic organ of the United \r\nNations, namely, the General Assembly, have time and \r\nagain requested an end to the embargo imposed on \r\nCuba.\r\nToday, we are meeting to consider this resolution \r\nonce again. The Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States wishes to affirm its support for what \r\nwill be the Assembly’s twenty-second resolution on \r\nthis matter. It is important to reiterate the underlying \r\nmotivations for the position of CELAC on this subject. \r\nIn our view, the commercial, economic and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba is contrary to the letter, \r\nspirit, and principles and purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law.\r\n4/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nan end to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, which is unilateral and \r\ncontrary to international law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. In addition, it causes huge material \r\nlosses and economic damage to the people of Cuba. \r\nThe NAM Summit further expressed deep concern \r\nover the widening of the extraterritorial nature of the \r\nembargo and rejected the reinforcement of the measure \r\nadopted by the Government of the United States aimed \r\nat tightening the embargo, as well as all other recent \r\nmeasures carried out by that Government against the \r\npeople of Cuba. They reiterated that those measures \r\nconstitute a violation of Cuba’s sovereignty and a \r\nmassive violation of the human rights of its people. The \r\nNAM Summit also urged strict compliance with the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutionson this issue.\r\nThe coercive measures in place are more than just \r\na bilateral embargo against Cuba, as the Government \r\nof the United States claims. They in fact consist of an \r\nextraterritorial embargo that affects Cuba’s dealings \r\nwith third countries, which violates State sovereignty \r\nand the right to free trade. In so doing, it further f louts \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe embargo, which has been in place for more than \r\n50 years, is also a despicable practice, as it undermines \r\nthe human rights of the Cuban people. For over 50 years, \r\nthe embargo has sought a change of Government in \r\nCuba through pressuring and punishing the Cuban \r\npeople. It has so far failed to achieve that goal, and it \r\nwill not ever be able to achieve it.\r\nThe attempt on the part of the United States \r\nGovernment is characteristic of an era in which lawless \r\nactions and behaviours prevailed in relations among \r\nStates. Despite the huge pressure, the people of Cuba \r\nhave endured hardship resulting from the embargo over \r\nso many decades. They are indeed worthy of praise for \r\nthe significant progress they have made, specifically \r\nin sensitive areas like education, health care and \r\ninternational cooperation, among others. Undoubtedly, \r\nthe embargo has denied Cuba access to markets, \r\nto development aid from international financial \r\ninstitutions, and to technology transfer, which are of \r\ngreat importance for the development of the Cuban \r\neconomy and for the well-being and advancement of its \r\npeople.\r\nIn closing, my delegation reiterates, on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, its call on the Government \r\nof the United States of America to comply with the \r\nprovisions of the 21 resolutions already adopted by the \r\nThe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates strongly supports the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”. We emphasize \r\nthe incompatibility of the application of unilateral \r\nmeasures, which have no backing in international law, \r\nwith the letter, spirit, and principles and purposes of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We call urgently \r\non the United States of America to align its relevant \r\nnational legislation with the Charter, the resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly, the views of the countries of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean and of all the regions \r\nof the world, as well as with the voice of its own people.\r\nCELAC is counting on the support traditionally \r\ngiven to the resolution submitted today for the \r\nconsideration of this body, which refers to the adverse \r\neffects being inflicted on one of our members.\r\nFinally, we call for the respect, with no excuses, \r\nfor the sovereignty and self-determination of the Cuban \r\nnation.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM).\r\nAllow me to begin by recognizing the presence at \r\nthis meeing of His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba. Through \r\nhim we offer our greetings to and solidarity with the \r\npeople and Government of Cuba.\r\nToday, we are considering for the twenty-second \r\ntime a draft resolution on the embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States Government against Cuba (A/68/L.6). \r\nLast year, in an historic move, 188 Member States in \r\nthe Assembly voted in favour of a similar resolution \r\n(resolution 67/4), thereby expressing their support to \r\nthe people of Cuba and overwhelmingly denouncing the \r\nillegal embargo against that country. The overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States that supported the resolution \r\nclearly showed how the international community stands \r\non this important issue.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement has always reiterated \r\nits strongest opposition to unilateral coercive measures \r\nwith extraterritoriality effects.\r\nAt the most recent Summit of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, held in Tehran in August 2012, the Heads \r\nof State or Government reiterated their call on the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America to put \r\n13-53496 5/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nremember that role, and the people of Cuba should \r\ncontinue to be proud of that historic contribution.\r\nMr. Olhaye (Djibouti): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation \r\n(O1C) on agenda item 40, : “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. \r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report on \r\nthe embargo (A/68/116), which has been in place for \r\nhalf a century despite its repeated rejection by Member \r\nStates, the United Nations system and regional and \r\nnon-governmental organizations.\r\nAs it has done in the past, the OIC expresses its \r\ndeep concern at the lingering embargo against Cuba, \r\nwhich contravenes the basic principles governing \r\npeaceful relations among States and also violates the \r\nprinciples of non-intervention and non-interference in \r\nthe domestic affairs of States, as well as the sovereign \r\nequality of States.\r\nSince 1992, every year, the General Assembly has \r\nadopted a resolution highlighting the unacceptable \r\nhumanitarian cost and effects on the Cuban population \r\nof the embargo’s many direct and indirect punitive \r\nmeasures, which in all probability have been \r\ncounterproductive in terms of their impact on Cuba’s \r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThose unilateral measures have helped to infringe \r\nupon and impede the development aspirations of the \r\npeople of Cuba and have continuously frustrated the \r\nefforts of Cubans to enjoy decent living conditions. \r\nThe OIC stresses that the unilateral measures of the \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba have severely affected many \r\ncompanies and entities that conduct normal business \r\nwith Cuba in accordance with international law and \r\nwithin the regulatory framework of the World Trade \r\nOrganization, thereby causing severe economic and \r\ncommercial hardship in the nation.\r\nThe OIC is fully committed to contributing towards \r\nthe achievement of peaceful coexistence among nations \r\nand adhering to the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. In the same vain, all nations, regardless \r\nof their power, size or natural endowment, are called \r\nupon to fully adhere to the principles of mutual respect, \r\nthe peaceful conduct of relations among nations and the \r\nrule of law. \r\nThe normalization of relations between the United \r\nStates of America and Cuba is long overdue; the \r\nprevailing situation is unsustainable. We all agree that \r\nGeneral Assembly on this issue and to put an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nMr. Bame (Ethiopia): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the African Group on agenda item 40, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nThe African Group associates itself with the \r\nstatement made earlier by the representative of Fiji on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nFor over two decades, the General Assembly has \r\nadopted, by an overwhelming majority, resolutions \r\nsubmitted by Cuba on this agenda item. However, over \r\nthose years, the resolutions have not been implemented \r\nat all. The economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade has not been lifted, and it continues to cause \r\nunnecessary hardship on Cuba and its people.\r\nIn today’s world, dialogue and negotiation remain \r\nthe appropriate way to settle disputes and to ensure \r\npeaceful coexistence among States. Africa hopes that \r\nthe United States, in accordance with the purposes and \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe relevant General Assembly resolutions, will put an \r\nend to its embargo against Cuba. The African Group \r\nalso hopes that relations between the two countries will \r\nsignificantly improve. Apart from the benefits in the \r\nbilateral area, that will contribute to the promotion of \r\nstability and development in the entire region.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to reiterate the decision \r\nof the 21st Ordinary Session of the Assembly of Heads \r\nof State and Government of the African Union on the \r\nmatter at its meeting held in Addis Ababa on 26 May \r\n2013. Our Heads of State and Government reiterated \r\ntheir call on and once again invited the Government of \r\nthe United States of America to lift the economic and \r\ntrade embargo imposed on Cuba. It is our hope that the \r\nUnited States, in line with the resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly, will consider its position with the view to \r\ncreating a situation for a new chapter in United States-\r\nCuba relations, for which the lifting of the embargo \r\nwould no doubt lay a very solid foundation.\r\nAfrica affirms its full support for draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6 before us on the necessity of ending the \r\nembargo against Cuba. We do so, first of all, because \r\nit is right. We do so also because Cuba has a proud \r\nhistory in Africa because of its role in Africa’s struggle \r\nfor liberation. The people of Africa will continue to \r\n6/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nmeasures are against the rights to peace, development \r\nand the security of sovereign States. Moreover, those \r\nmeasures contravene the norms of the multilateral \r\ntrade system and the very nature of the World Trade \r\nOrganization.\r\nThe embargo also violates the principles of justice \r\nand human rights, and causes hardship and suffering \r\namong the entire Cuba people. It restricts economic \r\nand social progress and prevents the achievement \r\nof international development goals, including the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We therefore regret the \r\nfact that the embargo imposed unilaterally on Cuba by \r\nthe United States of America still remains unchanged, \r\neven in the twenty-first century. An increase in the \r\nrestrictions on financial transactions between Cuba and \r\nthird countries is a major hindrance to direct dialogue.\r\nThe States members of MERCOSUR and \r\nassociated States reject, on principle, all unilateral \r\nand extraterritorial measures. We believe that such \r\nmeasures cause irreparable damage to the well-being of \r\npeople and prevent the process of regional integration. \r\nWe also condemn the implementation of coercive \r\nunilateral measures contrary to the principles of free \r\ntrade. The blockade has been the main obstacle to the \r\neconomic and social development of Cuba and has \r\nhampered international cooperation. MERCOSUR \r\nand its associated States reiterate their unconditional \r\nsupport for draft resolution A/68/L.6, reaffirming \r\nour commitment to multilateralism as the legitimate \r\ninstrument for resolving conflicts, an effective way to \r\npromote international cooperation and understanding \r\namong peoples.\r\nIt is clear that the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community reject the inhumane measures \r\nin question, which was made clear to us in 2012, when \r\n188 Member States voted in favour of the resolution.\r\nTrying to restrict the ability of the Cuban \r\nGovernment to gain access to what it needs in order \r\nto ensure health care, education and technological \r\nassistance and to provide food to its people only harms \r\nCubans, who have the right to development. The \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\non Cuba is nothing other than an example of obsolete \r\npolicies that have no place in today’s world. In adopting \r\nthe draft resolution, the Assembly will prove once \r\nagain its undeniable political will to defend the ideals \r\nof freedom, solidarity and respect for sovereignty and \r\ninternational law.\r\nit is high time that pragmatism and a sense of purpose \r\novertake the long-running inertia, innuendos, acrimony \r\nand distrust. Because of its uniqueness in this otherwise \r\nharmonious and f lourishing hemisphere, the blockade \r\nserves no purpose; it is an anomaly and, indeed, an \r\nanachronism that can no longer be justified on political \r\nor moral grounds, or in the context of international \r\ncooperation.\r\nFinally, the OIC joins the overwhelming majority of \r\nMember States in acknowledging the negative impact \r\nthat the blockade has had, and continues to have, on \r\nthe welfare and well-being of the people of Cuba, and \r\nin calling upon the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica to put an end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba.\r\nMember States of the OIC will again this year \r\nfully support the draft resolution against the embargo \r\n(A/68/L.6), and urge all other States to do so.\r\nThe President: Before giving the f loor to the next \r\nspeaker, I would like to propose that the list of speakers \r\nbe closed in view of the large number of delegations on \r\nthe list.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Moncada (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): I have the honour of speaking on \r\nbehalf of the member States of Southern Common \r\nMarket (MERCOSUR), including the associated States \r\nof Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. \r\nI should also like to pay tribute to the presence of \r\nMr. Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba.\r\nMERCOSUR was founded on the principles of \r\nsolidarity, interdependence and peaceful coexistence \r\namong our countries. We believe that tolerance is \r\nthe foundation that has made possible the historic \r\nconvergence on our continent of peoples from all corners \r\nof the world. We are linked to our Latin American \r\nneighbours by the desire to live in peace, promote \r\nmutual understanding, and defend independence and \r\nequality among States.\r\nAfter 53 years of the policy of economic asphyxiation \r\nagainst Cuba, MERCOSUR and its associated States \r\ncontinue to believe that the embargo violates the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe norms of international law, in particular, equality \r\namong States, non-interference in their internal affairs \r\nand the peaceful resolution of conflicts. The embargo \r\n13-53496 7/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nto multilateralism based on respect for international \r\nlaw, which is a key factor in strengthening peace, \r\ncooperative solidarity and sustainable economic and \r\nsocial development, including respect for human rights \r\nand understanding between peoples.\r\nFinally, we enthusiastically support draft resolution \r\nA/67/L.6, which is no less than a cry on the part of the \r\nvast majority of the peoples and Governments of the \r\nworld, asking the United States Government to abide by \r\nthe standards of international law.\r\nMr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I have the honour \r\nto address the Assembly on behalf of the 14 member \r\nStates of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \r\nnamely, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, \r\nBelize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nSuriname, Trinidad and Tobago and Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis. \r\nCARICOM aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby the representatives of Fiji on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, and of Chile on behalf \r\nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates.\r\nEvery year for the past 22 consecutive years, we \r\nhave gathered in this setting to mingle our voices \r\nwith the many others opposed to the imposition by the \r\nUnited States of its economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo on the Republic of Cuba. For 53 years the \r\nCuban people have endured severe economic loss and \r\nstagnation, preventing the expansion of their country’s \r\ncommercial ties to the rest of the world. The embargo \r\nhas persisted for too long, in spite of the unambiguous \r\nand overwhelming objection of a majority of Member \r\nStates, as demonstrated by the annual adoption of a \r\ndraft resolution, such as that before us today (A/68/L.6).\r\nLast year, 188 Member States voted in favour of \r\nthe resolution 67/4, under the same agenda item. The \r\nUnited Nations is made up of 193 Member States. That \r\nspeaks volumes in the international community. The \r\npeople of Cuba, however, continue to be stif led by the \r\nblockade. The social, economic and humanitarian costs \r\nof the embargo are becoming more and more acute. \r\nCuba’s security and advance preparedness and the pace \r\nof its recovery from disasters are compromised by the \r\nembargo’s many direct and indirect effects. Indeed, it \r\nis in such times of national crisis that the fundamental \r\ninjustice of the Cuban embargo is brought into sharpest \r\nI shall now speak in my national capacity.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates \r\nits firm rejection and denunciation of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America on the brotherly people \r\nof Cuba. Such measures are a f lagrant violation of \r\ninternational law and particularly of the respect for State \r\nsovereignty, the right of a people to self-determination, \r\nnon-intervention in Cuba’s internal affairs, freedom \r\nof navigation and trade and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. We have emphasized that such unilateral \r\ncoercive measures have an extraterritorial impact that \r\naffects the freedom to trade enshrined in the World \r\nTrade Organization and its constituent instruments and \r\nprevents third-party States from maintaining free and \r\nsovereign economic, financial and trade relations with \r\nthe Republic of Cuba.\r\nHowever, the United States Government’s illegal \r\nblockade of Cuba has not blocked solidarity among \r\npeoples, particularly the cooperation and reciprocity \r\nthat exist between Venezuela and Cuba. One of the \r\nbeneficiaries of the cooperation between Cuba and \r\nVenezuela has been the pressing issue of our people’s \r\nwelfare in the area of health care. I would like to recall \r\nthat on 30 October 2000, the then-Presidents of Cuba \r\nand Venezuela, Fidel Castro and Hugo Chávez Frías, \r\nsigned a historically significant cooperative agreement \r\non health, designed to improve Venezuela’s health-care \r\nsystem. Tomorrow is the thirteenth anniversary of that \r\nagreement, which has made a significant contribution \r\nto raising Venezuela’s human development indicators \r\nand thus to the country’s ability to meet the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2015.\r\nAttempting to use an embargo to diminish the \r\nGovernment of Cuba’s capacity is an interventionist \r\naction on the part of the United States Government, \r\nbut what is even more serious is the attempt to punish \r\na people for choosing their own Government, an issue \r\nthat runs contrary to the nature of the American people \r\nthemselves, who surely do not support such a position.\r\nOur Bolivarian Government and people demand \r\nthat the Government of the United States comply with \r\nthe resolutions that the General Assembly has adopted \r\nsince 1991 by an overwhelming majority, and move to \r\nimmediately and definitively lift the inhumane, more \r\nthan 50-year-long blockade, which constitutes a morally \r\nunacceptable collective punishment. Removing those \r\nunilateral measures would represent a demonstration \r\non the part of the United States of its commitment \r\n8/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nCommunity have benefited from university educations \r\nin Cuba free of charge, and Cuba has unselfishly \r\nextended much generosity to the CARICOM member \r\nState of Haiti, following the devastating earthquake \r\nthere. During the fourth CARICOM-Cuba Summit, \r\nheld in December 2011 in Port-of-Spain, the heads of \r\nState and Government of CARICOM issued a statement \r\nstrongly rejecting the imposition of the embargo and its \r\nextraterritorial effects and celebrating the outcome of \r\nthe Summit in its reinforcement of the strong fraternal \r\nbonds between CARICOM and Cuba. That position is \r\nreiterated here today.\r\nCARICOM member States also continue to value \r\nand enjoy long-established, warm and friendly relations \r\nwith the United States of America. It is, therefore, in \r\nthat spirit that we urge its Government to heed the calls \r\nof the international community to end the embargo. \r\nIn that regard, we also encourage engagement in a \r\nconstructive process of dialogue and the normalization \r\nof relations. We believe that that would be in the interest \r\nof all parties and would significantly contribute to \r\ngreater peaceful development and cooperation within \r\nthe Americas.\r\nWe must not be content to be a mere symbol \r\nof change. Accordingly, CARICOM delegations \r\nfully support the draft resolution before the General \r\nAssembly entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/68/L.6), \r\nand we will vote for its adoption.\r\nMr. Adeeb (India): I am honoured to make \r\na statement on this important agenda item. India \r\nassociates itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nthe representative of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nThis is the twenty-second successive year that the \r\nAssembly has been deliberating on the decades-old \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\non Cuba. Every one of those years, the Assembly \r\nhas repeatedly rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of coercive economic measures that hurt the \r\nprogress and prosperity of people around the world. The \r\nAssembly has also called upon all States to respect their \r\nobligations under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law and to repeal and invalidate laws \r\nand measures that have extraterritorial effects on the \r\nsovereignty of other States and affect the legitimate \r\nfocus. When viewed in the light of the generosity and \r\nself less assistance that Cuba has kindly accorded other \r\nStates in times of need, the unilateral application of \r\nthe embargo against Cuba is seen to be especially ill \r\nconceived. Such events underscore the need, not for \r\nintensification of punitive measures, but rather for \r\ngreater regional and international cooperation and \r\nsolidarity.\r\nAs a bloc of States that are small in size, the \r\nCaribbean Community greatly values the strength that \r\nlies in its collective capacity and will, and maintains \r\na firm stance on common principles that promote our \r\nshared objectives. Those principles include adherence \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations, multilateralism, \r\nsovereignty and free trade. It is in that spirit that the \r\nCaribbean Community has remained unstinting in \r\nits solidarity with Cuba and in calling for an end to a \r\nembargo that runs counter to both the letter and the spirit \r\nof the Charter and serves no justifiable legal, political \r\nor moral purpose within contemporary international \r\nrelations.\r\nDespite such significant challenges, Cuba \r\ncontinues to show itself to be a key regional and \r\ninternational partner and actor. CARICOM member \r\nStates, in keeping with our policy of mutual respect, of \r\nbeing good neighbours and of respect for the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, continue to \r\nhave good relations with Cuba, which have remained \r\ncordial and resilient despite the continually evolving \r\nhemispheric and international geopolitical landscape. \r\nCuba maintains embassies in all independent countries \r\nof the Caribbean Community and continues to prove \r\nitself to be an integral part of the Caribbean.\r\nIn that context, CARICOM and Cuba have \r\ndeveloped and enjoyed mutually beneficial \r\nprogrammes of cooperation and trade in a number \r\nof key areas, including physical education, sports, \r\naccounting, the natural sciences, the humanities, the \r\neconomy, special education, and health and medicine. \r\nIn that regard, CARICOM also profoundly appreciates \r\nCuba’s proposals for other areas of cooperation with \r\nthe Community, such as the treatment of physical \r\ndisabilities, the arts, language training, agriculture and \r\nfisheries, water and infrastructure.\r\nIn the Caribbean alone, Cuba has built hospitals and \r\nclinics, provided medicines and furnished doctors, nurses \r\nand other health-care professionals — contributions \r\nthat continue to be received and remembered with \r\nthe utmost appreciation. Students from the Caribbean \r\n13-53496 9/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nBefore concluding, permit me to reiterate India’s \r\nopposition to unilateral measures that are taken by \r\ncountries and impinge on the sovereignty of other \r\ncountries, including attempts to extend the application \r\nof a country’s laws extraterritorially to other sovereign \r\nnations. India joins other nations in calling for an \r\nimmediate end to the embargo against Cuba. India \r\nsupports the draft resolution sponsored by Cuba \r\n(A/68/L.6).\r\nMr. Lasso Mendoza (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the Republic of Ecuador, I have the honour \r\nof welcoming the presence here today of the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the sisterly Republic of Cuba, \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, who will introduce, on \r\nbehalf of his people and for the twenty-second time, the \r\ntext of a draft resolution that is aimed only at achieving \r\njustice and is entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nEcuador will, as always, vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution, because it is a clear way to express our \r\nsolidarity and consistency in this matter. Furthermore, \r\nour Constitution condemns interference by States in \r\nthe internal affairs of other States, whatever form such \r\ninterference takes. We therefore openly condemn and \r\nreject the infamous Helms-Burton Act, which is indeed \r\nthe basis for the immoral embargo against the sisterly \r\nRepublic of Cuba. That unilateral action by the United \r\nStates generates serious consequences with broad \r\nimpact and constitutes a clear violation of the principles \r\nof sovereign equality of States, non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States, \r\nand freedom of international trade and navigation, \r\nenshrined in both the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nother international legal instruments.\r\nIt is disconcerting that within this Organization \r\nwe should be talking about the post-2015 development \r\nprogramme and the integration of the pillars of \r\nsustainable development, while at the same time we \r\nare assessing the economic damage to Cuba’s trade and \r\nexternal sector caused by the embargo. It blockades the \r\ncountry’s population and clearly weakens all efforts to \r\nachieving the internationally agreed goals.\r\nIt seems only right that the resolutions of the United \r\nNations be implemented. We have voted in favour of \r\nthis resolution for 22 years. Not only it is frustrating \r\nnot to put an end to the infamous embargo, but we are \r\ndemonstrating the inability of the Organization to bring \r\nto fruition processes that are undoubtedly in the interest \r\ninterests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction \r\nand freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nDespite the repeated calls of the General Assembly, \r\nits resolutions remain unimplemented, in contravention \r\nof world opinion. Such disregard of the collective will \r\nof the international community expressed through \r\nthe United Nations undermines the credibility of this \r\ninstitution and weakens multilateralism. India strongly \r\nsupports the categorical rejection by the international \r\ncommunity of domestic laws with extraterritorial \r\nimpact.\r\nThe embargo on Cuba has resulted in immense \r\nsuffering for the Cuban people. It is a violation of \r\nthe right of a sovereign State to develop and to enjoy \r\nfreedom of trade, economy and navigation. The \r\nembargo has denied a life of dignity to the people of \r\nCuba and has severely undermined the progress of \r\nthat country. The adverse impact of the embargo has \r\nbeen made worse by the global economic and financial \r\ncrisis and the rise in global food and energy prices. The \r\nembargo has also denied the Cuban economy access to \r\nmarkets, investments and technology, which are needed \r\nfor rapid and inclusive development.\r\nThe Economic Commission for Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean has noted that the embargo limits \r\nkey policy options for the Cuban Government, and its \r\nefforts to update the economic model of the country are \r\nhampered by the embargo. The Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations has pointed out that \r\nthe embargo has very negative implications for Cuba’s \r\nbalance of trade and foreign exchange earnings and the \r\ncountry’s supply of food and agriculture products, and \r\nhas a direct effect on the food security of the vulnerable \r\nsegments of the population. The Office of the Resident \r\nCoordinator of the United Nations system in Cuba \r\nhas further brought to our attention the fact that the \r\nembargo has a pervasive impact on the social, economic \r\nand environmental dimensions of human development \r\nin Cuba, affecting the most vulnerable socioeconomic \r\ngroups of the Cuban population in particular. Those \r\ninstances are clear evidence of the immense suffering \r\ncaused to the Cuban people as a result of the embargo.\r\nWe believe that differences between countries \r\nshould be solved through dialogue and negotiation in a \r\nspirit of mutual respect for each other’s independence \r\nand sovereignty and of non-interference in others’ \r\ninternal affairs. It is of utmost importance that the spirit \r\nof multilateralism embodied by the United Nations be \r\nrespected.\r\n10/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\ntoday we once again send this message to the United \r\nStates:\r\n(spoke in Spanish):\r\nEnd the embargo now.\r\n(spoke in English):\r\nWe hope that this time our call will not go unheard.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I wish to start my statement \r\nby welcoming the presence among us of Comrade \r\nBruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Cuba.\r\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made earlier on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nand the Southern Common Market.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General (A/68/116) \r\nonce again makes apparent the global rejection of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo that the \r\nUnited States of America has arbitrarily and unilaterally \r\nimposed against the Cuban people and against humanity. \r\nThe embargo affects international cooperation. It affects \r\nhealth and food, education, culture and sports in Cuba. \r\nIt affects Cuba’s foreign trade and foreign investment. \r\nIt has banking and financial consequences. It affects \r\nconstruction, tourism, industry, communications, the \r\nenergy and mining sector, transportation, civil aviation \r\nand the sugar industry. The embargo is an example of \r\nthe unilateralism with which the United States operates \r\nin the world. Despite the embargo, however, Cuba is an \r\nexample of socioeconomic development, cooperation \r\nand solidarity.\r\nBolivia comes again to join the community of \r\nnations to repudiate most energetically the criminal \r\nembargo, which has become one of the deepest open \r\nwounds that lacerate the spirit of the whole human \r\nfamily. The United States is unilaterally imposing \r\nan unjust embargo. The United States is unilaterally \r\nimposing an illegitimate embargo. The United States is \r\nunilaterally imposing an immoral embargo. The United \r\nStates is unilaterally imposing an illegal embargo. The \r\nUnited States is unilaterally imposing an extraterritorial \r\nembargo that violates the aims, principles and purposes \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. The United States \r\nis imposing an embargo that is damaging the principles \r\nof sovereignty, non-intervention in internal affairs, \r\nand freedom of trade and navigation. It is imposing an \r\nof international peace and security — fundamental \r\nprecepts of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Khalil (Egypt): First of all, I would like to \r\nwelcome His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and assure him of \r\nEgypt’s continued support and solidarity.\r\nI align myself with the statements made earlier \r\nby the representatives of Fiji on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China; Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement; Ethiopia on behalf of the African Group; \r\nand Djibouti on behalf of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation.\r\nSixty-eight years ago, almost to the day, on \r\n24 October 1945, the Charter of the United Nations \r\nentered into force. One of its main purposes is to develop \r\nfriendly relations among nations based on respect for \r\nthe principle of equal rights and self-determination \r\nof peoples. For the past 53 years, the United States of \r\nAmerica, one of the founders of the United Nations, \r\nhas been violating that noble purpose by imposing a \r\nunilateral embargo against Cuba — an embargo that \r\nis morally unjustifiable and legally indefensible and \r\nwhich runs counter to the norms of international law.\r\nLast year, 188 countries voted in favour of \r\nresolution 67/4, calling for an immediate end to the \r\nembargo. Egypt finds it troubling that despite that \r\nquasi-unanimous rejection of the embargo, the screws \r\nare still being tightened against Cuba, in total disregard \r\nof the stance of the international community. The \r\ndamage caused by the embargo on Cuba is enormous. \r\nIt affects crucial sectors of the country’s economy and \r\nthe well-being of the Cuban people. The embargo also \r\nhas negative repercussions on companies and citizens \r\nfrom third countries.\r\nDespite the undue economic and social hardship, \r\nCubans have continued to make developmental gains, \r\nmost notably in education, health care and gender \r\nequality. We salute their determination and resilience \r\nin the face of adversity.\r\nThe American Administration has recently stated \r\nthat it will engage with Cuba. Those encouraging \r\nwords have regrettably not been translated into action. \r\nThe punitive measures imposed on Cuba persist, and \r\nwith them the suffering of a brave nation continues. \r\nThe United States cannot indefinitely ignore the will \r\nof the international community. It cannot forever turn a \r\nblind eye to what is right and what is wrong. That goes \r\nagainst its values, history and tradition. That is why \r\n13-53496 11/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nthe need to end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. In them the Assembly urges all countries \r\nto abide by the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nnorms of international law and to repeal or invalidate \r\nany laws or measures that are of an extraterritorial \r\nnature, that infringe upon the sovereignty of another \r\nState or the legitimate rights and interests of the entities \r\nand individuals under the jurisdiction of that State, and \r\nthat have an adverse impact on freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation.\r\nRegrettably, however, those resolutions have never \r\nbeen effectively implemented, and the United States \r\ncontinues to impose an economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba. That has inflicted \r\nenormous economic and financial losses on Cuba. The \r\ndata shows that, taking into account the depreciation of \r\nthe dollar against gold in the international markets, by \r\nApril 2013, the embargo had resulted in direct economic \r\nlosses to Cuba in the amount of $1,157,327,000,000.\r\nThe embargo has led to shortages of supplies and \r\nseriously undermined the Cuban economy, creating \r\ntremendous obstacles to Cuba’s economic and social \r\ndevelopment. The embargo has caused enormous \r\nsuffering for the Cuban people and has severely impeded \r\ntheir efforts to eradicate poverty, promote economic \r\nand social development and achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It has violated the basic human \r\nrights of the Cuban people to food, health and education \r\nand their right to survival and development. It has not \r\nonly caused major setbacks for the Cuban economy, \r\nbut also affected the normal economic, commercial \r\nand financial interactions between Cuba and other \r\ncountries, thereby undermining the interests and \r\nsovereignty of third countries.\r\nThe embargo against Cuba is strongly opposed by \r\nthe majority of Member States, as it is a blatant violation \r\nof the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions. The call of the international community is \r\ngetting louder and louder, demanding that the United \r\nStates Government change its policy towards Cuba, lift \r\nthe embargo and normalize its relations with Cuba. That \r\nfact has been fully reflected in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport this year.\r\nThe Chinese Government has always advocated \r\nthat countries develop mutual relations on the basis \r\nof the purposes and principles of the Charter while \r\nrespecting the right of other countries to independently \r\nembargo that seeks to undermine the Cuban people’s \r\nright to self-determination and the efforts of their \r\nGovernment to fight poverty and inequality.\r\nI have here with me all the resolutions that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has adopted against the embargo. \r\nFor more than 20 years, one resolution after another \r\nhas rejected the embargo that the United States has \r\nunilaterally imposed on the Cuban people. Now is the \r\ntime for the Assembly and the United Nations to ensure \r\nrespect for the decisions that the Assembly has adopted.\r\nFrom this rostrum, the President of the United \r\nStates described to the members of the Assembly what \r\nhe called the “exceptional” nature of his country (see \r\nA/68/PV.5). If that country is exceptional, then the rest \r\nof us, the other members of the international community, \r\nby some twist of destiny have not been blessed with \r\nsuch exceptionality. Not only is that speech dangerous; \r\nnot only is it offensive; not only does it reveal criminal \r\nintent with regard to the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the purposes of this Organization; it also shows, as \r\nPresident Evo Morales has stated, the arrogance of a \r\nGovernment that is against all peoples. The Government \r\nof the United States is not exceptional, although it is \r\nunique. It is responsible for this genocidal blockade, \r\nwhich is without parallel in the history of mankind. It is \r\nunique because it does not respect international law. It \r\nis unique because it is not interested in multilateralism. \r\nIt is unique because it also acts with the most f lagrant \r\nimpunity.\r\nBolivia once again decisively supports the draft \r\nresolution that will be presented to the Assembly today \r\n(A/68/L.6). We also would like to thank the Cuban \r\npeople for their wonderful solidarity, which has saved \r\ntens of thousands of lives in my country. Once again in \r\nthis Assembly, the world calls for, the world requests, \r\nthe world demands an end to the blockade against Cuba.\r\nAllow me, Mr. President, to break with protocol for \r\na moment and conclude my statement by saying: Viva \r\nCuba!\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): Let me \r\nbegin by welcoming the report of the Secretary-General \r\non this agenda item (A/68/116).\r\nThe Chinese delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement delivered earlier by the representative of Fiji \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nFor 21 consecutive years, the General Assembly has \r\nadopted, by an overwhelming majority, resolutions on \r\n12/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nof the United Nations and of non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in one another’s domestic affairs. It \r\nviolates international humanitarian law, the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the norms and principles \r\ngoverning peaceful relations among States.\r\nThe Charter is clear on the need for nations to \r\ndevelop friendly relations among themselves. It is \r\nequally emphatic about the importance of nations \r\nrefraining from actions that threaten the political \r\nindependence of others or lead to interventions in \r\nmatters that are essentially within a State’s domestic \r\njurisdiction.\r\nUnfortunately, the sanctions have also had an indirect \r\nimpact on countries with economic and commercial ties \r\nto Cuba and thus encroach on the sovereignty of other \r\nStates and their national jurisdictions. The embargo \r\nnot only creates political complications, it also causes \r\neconomic, commercial and financial hardships that, \r\non humanitarian grounds, cannot be justified. That is \r\na great burden for a developing country whose people \r\nwould benefit tremendously from cooperation rather \r\nthan confrontation. The embargo has caused hardships \r\nfor the people of Cuba, particularly vulnerable groups. \r\nAgainst that backdrop, the General Assembly must \r\nonce again reaffirm its position by supporting draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.6.\r\nThe international community is quite confident \r\nthat engagement will do more than isolation to advance \r\nthe noble causes that all States Members of the United \r\nNations subscribe to. Dialogue has always been a \r\nconstructive avenue for dissolving tensions. The time is \r\nripe for relations between the two principal parties to be \r\ntransformed through constructive engagement. Lifting \r\nthe embargo would be in keeping with the spirit of the \r\ntimes. It would also demonstrate unambiguous respect \r\nfor the principle of non-intervention, as embodied in \r\nthe Charter and in international law. While it is true \r\nthat some small, meaningful changes have occurred in \r\nrecent times, such as the easing of restrictions on travel \r\nto Cuba and the removal of obstacles to the transfer of \r\nremittances, the preferable outcome is for the embargo \r\nto be lifted immediately. We all hope to see the tensions \r\nbetween the two countries resolved and harmonious, \r\npeaceful coexistence permeating their relations.\r\nIn an international climate marked by cooperation, \r\nthe embargo has become an anachronistic policy. \r\nIndonesia has repeatedly voted in favour of lifting \r\nthe embargo on Cuba, as an expression of our long-\r\nstanding and irrevocable commitment to the principles \r\nchoose their own social system and development path. \r\nChina is opposed to any unilateral sanctions against \r\nother countries by military, political, economic or other \r\nmeans. Meanwhile, China has strictly followed and \r\nimplemented the relevant Assembly resolutions. China \r\nand Cuba have maintained normal economic, trade \r\nand personnel exchanges. Our friendly and mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation in various fields has been \r\ngrowing. This is what our two peoples want, and it is in \r\nthe interest of Cuba’s economic and social development.\r\nIn today’s world, dialogue, exchanges and \r\nharmonious coexistence represent the mainstream of \r\ninternational relations. Exchanges and cooperation on \r\nan equal footing among countries have become the \r\ndominant trend. The best way to settle differences and \r\ndisputes is dialogue on an equal footing and friendly \r\nconsultation. China hopes that the United States will \r\nact according to the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter and the relevant Assembly resolutions and \r\nterminate its embargo against Cuba as soon as possible. \r\nChina also hopes for a steady improvement of the \r\nUnited States-Cuba relationship, which would in turn \r\nadvance stability and development in Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean region.\r\nChina will once again vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution submitted by Cuba under this agenda item \r\n(A/68/L.6).\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): Let me begin by warmly \r\nwelcoming Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla and \r\nassuring him of Indonesia’s unwavering support for \r\nending the embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe delegation of Indonesia associates itself with \r\nthe statements made earlier by the representatives of \r\nFiji and the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation, respectively.\r\nThe General Assembly, as the highest political \r\nforum of the United Nations, has consistently opposed \r\nthe unilateral policy imposed by the United States on \r\nCuba. The majority of Member States have expressed \r\ntheir concern about the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba and the adverse effects \r\nof such measures on the Cuban people. While the \r\nCuban people have endured the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo valiantly for 52 years, that has \r\ncome at a forbidding cost.\r\nThe continued imposition of that embargo violates \r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of all Members \r\n13-53496 13/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nand financial embargo against Cuba, which contradicts \r\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Every Member State \r\nshould respect the principles of the Charter, including, \r\nin particular, the sovereign equality of States, territorial \r\nintegrity, and non-intervention and non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of any other State.\r\nIt is a fact that the blockade has a negative effect \r\non the well-being of the Cuban people on a daily basis \r\nand causes huge material losses and economic damage \r\nto Cuba. Those consequences have been exacerbated \r\nby the adverse effects of the ongoing global economic \r\nand financial crisis, which has seriously compromised \r\nCuba’s development efforts. This is highlighted \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General (A/68/116), \r\nbased on information provided by more than 100 \r\nGovernments and by a significant number of entities \r\nand agencies of the United Nations system concerning \r\nthe implementation of last year’s resolution 67/4. \r\nThe embargo frustrates efforts to achieve all the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe all-important Millennium Development Goals, \r\nand negatively affects South-South cooperation and \r\ninternational cooperation generally.\r\nHere it is important to recall the long-standing \r\npositions of the Non-Aligned Movement and the Group \r\nof 77 and China on the issue. Accordingly, Algeria will \r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/68/L.6, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nMr. Imakando (Zambia): I have the honour to \r\naddress the Assembly on the matter relating to the draft \r\nresolution on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo on Cuba (A/68/L.6).\r\nMy delegation wishes to align this statement with \r\nthose delivered earlier by the representatives of Fiji \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China; Ethiopia on \r\nbehalf of the African Group; and Iran on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nZambia is concerned that after more than two \r\ndecades, the General Assembly is still debating an \r\nagenda item on which there has been overwhelming \r\nconsensus. This is so because, despite the clear \r\nmessage from the United Nations, the United States has \r\nmaintained the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba. Unless immediate efforts are \r\nundertaken to restore normalcy in economic relations, \r\nand purposes enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Indonesia rejects the use of any unilateral \r\nmeasures to exert pressure on States. For that reason, it \r\nhas never promulgated or applied any laws of the type \r\nreferred to in the draft resolution. We do not support \r\nor apply any laws and policies of an extraterritorial \r\nnature, since that would interfere with others’ domestic \r\naffairs as well as with freedom of international trade \r\nand navigation.\r\nIndonesia urges the renunciation of the application \r\nof laws and measures of an extraterritorial nature \r\nthat affect the sovereignty of other States, the lawful \r\ninterests of their subjects or other persons under their \r\njurisdiction, and freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nFinally, Indonesia supports and calls for the \r\nimmediate cessation of such an embargo.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to welcome His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and to \r\nconvey through him the greetings of the people and \r\nleadership of Algeria to the people and leadership of \r\nCuba.\r\nAlgeria aligns itself with the statements made \r\nearlier by the representatives of Iran on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement; Fiji on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China; Ethiopia on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates; and Djibouti on behalf of the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation.\r\nAlgeria would like to reiterate its deep concern \r\nabout the continuation of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo unilaterally imposed for more \r\nthan five decades now by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba. Annually, for many consecutive years, the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly have adopted, almost \r\nunanimously, a resolution calling for the lifting of the \r\nembargo against Cuba. That reflects the international \r\ncommunity’s profound determination to put an end to \r\na situation that has lasted far too long. Through those \r\nresolutions, the international community has continued \r\nto reaffirm that Cuba, like all other States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, has the right to freedom of trade \r\nand navigation and to expand trade with its economic \r\npartners.\r\nIn accordance with the principles of its foreign \r\npolicy, Algeria has always condemned the extraterritorial \r\napplication of laws and all forms of coercive economic \r\nand trade measures, such as this economic, commercial \r\n14/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nelection to serve as President of the General Assembly. \r\nI am convinced that with your excellent skill and \r\nexperience, you will guide this session of the Assembly \r\nmost successfully.\r\nWe welcome His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\ndelivered earlier by the representatives of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, and of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations have \r\nheld substantive and serious discussions, at many \r\nsuccessive sessions, on the absolute necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against the Republic \r\nof Cuba. Their common view is that this issue has \r\nhad significant and wide-reaching implications for \r\ninternational relations and the fundamental principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. The great majority \r\nof Member States have expressed their staunch protest \r\nagainst this embargo and have urgently called for it to \r\nbe brought to an end.\r\nViet Nam will once again join with the international \r\ncommunity to vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn so doing, Viet Nam entirely shares the view that the \r\nembargo unilaterally imposed by the United States is at \r\nvariance with the purposes of the United Nations and \r\nconstitutes a violation of the fundamental principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and of international \r\nlaw. These include sovereign equality, non-interference \r\nin internal affairs, the right of self-determination, \r\npeaceful coexistence and freedom of trade. This issue \r\nis very much a case about upholding the rule of law at \r\nthe international level.\r\nWe would again like to stress in particular the need \r\nfor dialogue and negotiations to settle differences or \r\ndisputes among States. This has proven to be essential \r\nto the strengthening of peace and security in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. It is also essential for peace, \r\nsecurity and normal international interactions in all \r\nother parts of the world, and for enhancing international \r\ncooperation as the international community is facing so \r\nmany challenges. In this regard, we welcome the call \r\nand proposal by the Government of Cuba to discuss \r\nhistory will judge all of us in the United Nations family \r\nrather harshly.\r\nThe Cold War is long over, and in its place nations \r\nhave been seeking to consolidate the era of international \r\ncooperation, with the United Nations taking centre \r\nstage. My delegation therefore urges that we not lose \r\nthis opportunity for all-inclusive global prosperity \r\nand for securing the peaceful coexistence of future \r\ngenerations.\r\nMy delegation wishes further to stress that the \r\nUnited States embargo against the people of Cuba \r\ncannot have a place in the twenty-first century. \r\nInstead, the world should rightly focus its attention on \r\nenhancing the livelihoods of all people in all nations, \r\nCuba included. Indeed, the Cuban nation should be \r\nhelped to consolidate its growth and development in \r\na manner that allows for the free participation of all \r\ncitizens. In other words, the unilateral embargo has \r\nno role when we are setting the stage for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. It is on this score that we stand \r\nwith the global chorus for the unconditional lifting of \r\nthe embargo against Cuba.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nZambia has no doubt that the time is ripe for Cuba and \r\nthe United States to free themselves from a stand-off \r\ndating from a long-gone era, when the majority of their \r\ncurrent citizens had not even been born. The present \r\ngenerations know little of the cause of the age-old \r\nimpasse, hence we must give them a chance to enjoy \r\nnormalcy. We therefore reiterate once again our call on \r\nthe United States to lift the embargo.\r\nDuring the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly, Zambia was one of the 188 countries that \r\nsupported resolution 67/4. Our stance is rooted in \r\nprinciple, and we wish to use this occasion to re-state \r\nour solidarity with the Cuban people. We remain \r\nconcerned that their development continues to be \r\nunnecessarily impeded to this day. That is in direct \r\ncontradiction of the spirit of international cooperation \r\nthat we have all been aspiring towards. For this reason, \r\nmy delegation is confident that the Assembly will once \r\nagain deliver a clear message of its support, which His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, will take back to the Cuban \r\npeople.\r\nMr. Le Hoai Trung (Viet Nam) (spoke in French): \r\nAs this is the first time I have taken the f loor at this \r\nsession, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\n13-53496 15/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\ntrade and financial embargoes that have been adopted \r\nunilaterally.\r\nAs a founding nation of the Organization, which \r\nwas born out of the rubble and bloody remnants of \r\nwar to celebrate a culture of peace, we call on all \r\nGovernments to demonstrate their full commitment to \r\ninternational law, diplomacy, the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, cooperation in the economic and trade area \r\nand the primacy of the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nResolution 67/4 calls for an immediate end to the \r\nadoption and implementation of unilateral measures \r\nthat have an adverse effect on other nations and \r\npeople. The extraterritorial nature of such measures \r\nis a f lagrant contravention of the basic principles of \r\ninternational law, particularly sovereignty and freedom \r\nof trade and navigation. Such action is unacceptable, \r\nparticularly when it has an impact on humanitarian aid, \r\nsuch as when the Brazilian contribution of $100,000 \r\nto the Cuban victims of Hurricane Sandy was blocked \r\nby the United States authorities last year. The transfer \r\nof funds from the Bank of Brazil branch in Miami to \r\na bank in Geneva is still awaiting clearance from the \r\nOffice of Foreign Assets Control of the United States \r\nDepartment of the Treasury.\r\nThus, apart from the illegal blockade, which runs \r\ncounter to the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the embargo also affects human rights, the \r\nrights of refugees and the rights of women and children, \r\nwho should, first and foremost, be given priority as \r\nthe poorest and most vulnerable among us. Brazil \r\ncommends Cuba for updating its economic model and \r\nsupports it in its domestic and foreign policies. Cuba’s \r\nprogress is being impeded by the economic embargo, \r\nwhich has aff licted its people for decades.\r\nThe Brazilian Government will continue not \r\nonly to oppose the economic, financial and trade \r\nembargo against Cuba, but also to foster friendlier and \r\nwarmer political and economic relations as a gesture \r\nfrom Brazil in solidarity with Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean. We believe that there is no America \r\nwithout the full participation of Cuba in all areas of \r\ninternational relations. Today, there is consensus \r\namong Latin American and Caribbean countries \r\nregarding the impossibility of holding future American \r\nsummits without Cuba being present. Calls for Cuba’s \r\nfull freedom and independence have always been made \r\nby Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole. Today, \r\nthat is true more than ever before.\r\nwith the United States their differences and issues of \r\nmutual interest.\r\nThe embargo has obviously caused enormous \r\ndamage to the socioeconomic development of Cuba and \r\nthe life of the country’s people, especially women and \r\nchildren. For all the many updates and reports about \r\nnegative impact of the embargo, the human suffering \r\nis undoubtedly immeasurable. The embargo is an \r\nencroachment on human rights. It is also one of the \r\nobstacles that need to be removed to the attainment \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, the reduction \r\nof poverty and the advancement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the post-2015 period. It is very pertinent \r\nto the theme of this session of the General Assembly, \r\n“The post-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. \r\nViet Nam therefore calls on the United States, in \r\nimplementation of relevant United Nations resolutions, \r\nto lift the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity \r\nto reiterate Viet Nam’s support for the right of the \r\npeople of Cuba to choose their path of development. \r\nWe appreciate the significant achievements that the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba have made in many \r\nareas, in spite of the numerous challenges. We welcome \r\ntheir active contribution to international cooperation in \r\nthe region and in other parts of the world to promote \r\nfriendly relations among countries and in the resolution \r\nof issues related to socioeconomic development.\r\nViet Nam fully subscribes to the contents of the \r\ndraft resolution before us and again urges its full \r\nimplementation after its adoption.\r\nMr. Patriota (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I too \r\nshould like to greet Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla \r\nof Cuba, who is here among us today. \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Fiji on behalf of the \r\nGropu of 77 and China, of Chile on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nand of Venezuela on behalf of the Southern Common \r\nMarket.\r\nBrazil reiterates its firm opposition to the \r\neconomic, trade and financial embargo imposed on \r\nCuba, as well as to the extraterritorial application of \r\ndomestic laws and discriminatory trade practices. \r\nBrazil urges Governments that have not complied with \r\nresolution 67/4 to take immediate measures to put an \r\nend to discriminatory trade practices and economic, \r\n16/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nsince it prevents the implementation of economic \r\nprogrammes aimed at the socioeconomic stability of \r\nthe country as well as its global integration.\r\nAngola reaffirms its commitment to international \r\nlaw, and from that perspective, it supports decisions that \r\ncontribute to the elimination of all coercive unilateral \r\neconomic measures used as a means of political \r\npersuasion against any sovereign State.\r\nWe call on the international community to continue \r\nits efforts to deepen its commitment to promoting a \r\nconstructive dialogue between the two countries for a \r\npermanent solution to the problem and to finding a path \r\nof normalization in their relations. After more than half \r\na century, the embargo on Cuba is a clear demonstration \r\nof a lack of political will, and it is also anachronistic.\r\nTo conclude, we appeal to the United States to \r\nreconsider its unilateral position, whose negative \r\nimpact on the life of the Cuban people shows clear signs \r\nof inhumanity.\r\nMr. Govender (South Africa): South Africa aligns \r\nitself with the statements made by the representatives \r\nof Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, of \r\nEthiopia on behalf of the Africa Group and of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. \r\nMy delegation also extends greetings to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, who is present here today.\r\nSouth Africa acknowledges the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/68/116), which emphasizes, \r\namong other principles, the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-intervention and non-interference in their \r\ninternal affairs and the freedom of international trade \r\nand navigation, which are also enshrined in many \r\ninternational legal instruments.\r\nCuba is still in the clutches of the unilateral \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo that was \r\nimposed on it by the United States of America over five \r\ndecades ago, despite the fact that the Assembly has \r\nbeen seized with the matter since its forty-sixth session, \r\nwhich was 22 years ago. The continued unilateral \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba constitutes clear disregard \r\nfor international law. It is also a f lagrant violation of \r\nthe Cuban people’s right to development, peace and \r\nsecurity. Furthermore, the embargo runs contrary to \r\nthe principles, purposes and spirit of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, especially the principles of the \r\nMr. Martins (Angola): Allow me to begin by \r\nextending a warm welcome to His Excellency Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs for \r\nCuba. I wish him a very fruitful stay at the United \r\nNations, a place he knows well. \r\nThe Republic of Angola associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representatives of Ethiopia on \r\nbehalf of the African Group, of Fiji on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe Republic of Angola reaffirms its commitment to \r\nputting an immediate end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba, and with that in mind, we will \r\nvote in favour of draft resolution A/68/L.6, which we \r\nhope will be adopted by a majority during this meeting \r\nand implemented thereafter.\r\nAngola joins the international community in \r\ncondemning the embargo against Cuba, which has \r\nlasted more than half a century and which f lagrantly \r\nviolates the inalienable rights of the Cuban people. \r\nIt is unacceptable that in the twenty-first century, \r\none country’s unilateral decision can deprive another \r\ncountry and its people of their right to enjoy their \r\nfundamental freedoms and to exercise freely their \r\npolitical, economic or commercial rights.\r\nAngola regrets the continuation of the embargo, \r\neven after the General Assembly’s successive \r\nresolutions requesting all member States, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, to repeal all \r\nlaws, regulations and extraterritorial measures that \r\nundermine the sovereignty of States, and the rights \r\nand legitimate interests of entities and persons under \r\nthe jurisdiction of such States and that have negative \r\nimpact on their freedom and their trade and navigation \r\nrights.\r\nAccording to the report of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/68/166), there is no record of measures by the \r\nGovernment of the United States that would contribute \r\nto ending the embargo against Cuba, even though the \r\nrestrictions it imposes are contrary to the purposes of the \r\nCharter and constitute a violation of international law. \r\nIn that sense, what is happening in Cuba is a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the rights to peace and development and to \r\nsafeguarding the sovereignty of States.\r\nThe ban goes beyond the commercial and financial \r\nrelations between the United States and Cuba; it has \r\nimplications that severely penalize the Cuban people, \r\n13-53496 17/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nthat has suffocated their country’s livelihood for over \r\n50 years now.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Department of Commerce of the United States has \r\nlaid out the following conditions that must be met for a \r\nlicense to be issued authorizing any equipment, device \r\nor medicine to be supplied to Havana’s William Soler \r\nChildren’s Heart Centre: the items in question must \r\nbe used exclusively to treat Cuban patients; the final \r\ndestination of the items must be monitored; they must \r\nnot be used to commit acts of torture or human rights \r\nviolations; and they must not be used in biotechnological \r\nproduction processes or re-exported. Appendix E of the \r\nlicense questionnaire requires copious documentation \r\nto ensure that the Heart Centre is in no way linked \r\nto the production of chemical or biological weapons, \r\nmissile technologies or nuclear weapons.\r\nDozens of prestigious specialists, at least five \r\nrenowned United States hospitals and many others \r\naround the world know the Cuban Centre very well \r\nand know that it specializes in paediatric cardiology \r\nand cardiological surgery. Since 2010, it has performed \r\nheart surgery on 1,101 children and cared for tens \r\nof thousands of little patients. However, the Heart \r\nCentre continues to be classified by the Department of \r\nCommerce as a “denied” hospital.\r\nConsequently, Cuban boys and girls cannot be \r\ntreated with an Amplatzer device, which is used to cure \r\ninter-atrial communication problems or close vascular \r\nshort-circuits inside the heart’s arterial pathways. Nor \r\ncan they be treated with devices commonly used for \r\ncatheterization or receive better quality, cutting-edge \r\nanti-arrhythmic and antibiotic drugs for the treatment \r\nof heart failure. As a result, dozens of minors have had \r\nto undergo thoracic surgeries that could have otherwise \r\nbeen avoided. Another 102 children suffering from \r\npulmonary hypertension could not be treated with \r\nnitric oxide, which is one of the best therapeutic drugs \r\navailable.\r\nLikewise, the Cardiovascular Surgery Institute \r\nlacks the spare parts, opaque dyes and complex software \r\nnecessary to perform echocardiograms. The Frank País \r\nOrthopaedic Hospital cannot replace its Sopha gamma \r\ncamera, which is required for diagnosing malignant \r\nsovereign equality of States and of non-intervention in \r\nthe domestic affairs of Member States.\r\nIn essence, however, what is at the heart of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo is an \r\nattempt to prevent Cuba from freely deciding on its \r\nown political and economic system. After more than \r\n50 years of the embargo, Cuba’s economic, social and \r\noverall development has been stunted. Misguided as it \r\nis, the embargo is one of the major causes of Cuba’s \r\neconomic problems and the main obstacle to its \r\neconomic and social development. The embargo has \r\nunfortunately inhibited every aspect of Cuba’s trade, \r\nincluding free access to humanitarian materials such as \r\nfood and medicines.\r\nThere is no legitimate or moral reason to maintain \r\nthe embargo. We therefore call for the embargo to be \r\nlifted urgently. Cuba’s prospects for economic recovery \r\nand social development will remain elusive unless the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo is lifted. \r\nWhat is also clear is that as long as the status quo \r\npersists, there are very limited prospects for Cuba to \r\nbenefit in a meaningful way from the United Nations-\r\ndriven post-2015 development agenda.\r\nWhat exacerbates the matter even further is that \r\nthe punitive measures of the economic embargo are \r\napplied extraterritorially. Companies, which naturally \r\nmigrate to larger and more lucrative markets, shy away \r\nfrom conducting business or having trade relations \r\nwith Cuba. That is due to the fear of the economic and \r\npolitical repercussions that are imposed against parties \r\nwho are alleged to have violated the blockade. Given that \r\nfact, we can say that the prospects for Cuba’s economic \r\ndevelopment are stif led owing to the continued lack of \r\naccess to foreign direct investment, large-scale tourism \r\nand even foreign banking institutions. Despite such \r\nchallenges, the Cuban people have always remained \r\ntrue to the principle of solidarity, even beyond their \r\nown borders. We know this because we have benefited \r\nfrom their solidarity.\r\nIt is for those reasons that South Africa has \r\nalways voted in favour of the draft resolutions on the \r\nnecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba and will always be committed \r\nto the principles, purpose and spirit of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Furthermore, we support draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.6 because it is the people of Cuba \r\nthemselves — women, children, the elderly and the \r\nvulnerable — who bear the brunt of the stranglehold \r\n18/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nparticipation in Government decisions, reversals of \r\nenvironmental deterioration and the development \r\nof international cooperation with 100 third-world \r\ncountries. How much more could we have done without \r\nthat colossal obstacle to our development and the \r\nenormous human and financial costs it has imposed on \r\nus?\r\nUnder President Obama’s Administration the \r\nblockade has grown even more severe, particularly in \r\nthe financial sector. Historically, the United States has \r\nused the enormous technological power of its recently \r\ndenounced massive global espionage system to follow \r\nand monitor our financial transactions and economic \r\nrelations. From January 2009 to September 2013, the \r\nfines imposed on 30 North American and foreign entities \r\nfor their relations with Cuba and other countries have \r\namounted to more than $2.446 billion. In December \r\n2012, for the same reason, the British bank HSBC and \r\nthe Japanese bank Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ were fined \r\n$375 million and $8.6 million, respectively. In March \r\n2013, the Reuters press agency suspended its banking \r\nand financial information services. The economic siege \r\nhas been ramped up, and its impact can be seen in the \r\nscarcities and difficulties that Cuban families suffer \r\nfrom in every aspect of their lives.\r\nThe United States is not a trading partner of Cuba, \r\ndespite what has been shamelessly asserted by its \r\nrepresentatives, because a State to which it is impossible \r\nto export products or from which it is impossible to buy \r\nservices and products cannot be said to be a trading \r\npartner. Nor can a State where United States dollars \r\ncannot be used in transactions, or whose subsidiaries in \r\nthird-party countries are forbidden to buy foodstuffs or \r\nmedicines, owing to the Torricelli Act, which also bans \r\nthe entry into United States ports for 180 days of any \r\nship in the world that has docked at our island; or a State \r\nthat prevents other nations from selling to Cuba any \r\nmerchandise containing more than 10 per cent of United \r\nStates components or from exporting to the United \r\nStates any product containing Cuban raw materials. No \r\nState can be a trading partner when it implements the \r\nHelms-Burton Act, which expanded the extraterritorial \r\nscope of the blockade and comprehensively codified the \r\nregime change and the eventual intervention in Cuba. \r\nNo State can be a trading partner when it invokes the \r\nTrade with the Enemy Act of 1917, which applies only \r\nin war situations and is enforced only for Cuba.\r\nOur small island poses no threat to the national \r\nsecurity of the super-Power. Why, then, can Americans \r\ntumours and bone and joint infections. The Pedro Kouri \r\nInstitute of Tropical Medicine is not allowed to purchase \r\nKaletra, an anti-viral oral solution for children, since \r\nit has no license from the Treasury Department to \r\nimport it. That medicine inhibits the replication of the \r\nHIV virus in children who are born with HIV, boosts \r\ntheir immunological system and prevents opportunistic \r\ndiseases.\r\nThe human suffering caused by the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba is incalculable. It imposes \r\nhardship and is a massive, f lagrant and systematic \r\nviolation of human rights. 76 per cent of Cubans have \r\nlived under its devastating effects their entire lives. \r\nThe blockade has been classified as an act of genocide \r\nunder article II of the Convention on the Prevention \r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and an act \r\nof economic warfare under the Declaration concerning \r\nthe Laws of Naval War adopted in 1909.\r\nThe State Department lies about and manipulates \r\nthe data on remittances sent by émigrés and creates \r\nobstacles to the transfer of small donations by \r\nnon-governmental organizations, with the purpose of \r\nportraying its Government as a donor of humanitarian \r\nassistance to our nation. A memorandum from the then \r\nUnited States Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, \r\nLester Mallory, dated 6 April 1960 and declassified \r\n30 years later, states:\r\n“The majority of Cubans support Castro ... \r\nThere is no effective political opposition ... The only \r\nforeseeable means of alienating internal support \r\nis through disenchantment and disaffection based \r\non economic dissatisfaction and hardship ... Every \r\npossible means should be undertaken promptly \r\nto weaken the economic life [of Cuba], denying \r\nmoney and supplies ... to decrease monetary and \r\nreal wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and \r\nthe overthrow of the Government”.\r\nIt is barbaric and incredible that 53 years later, the same \r\npolicy still prevails.\r\nThe economic damage that has accumulated \r\nafter half a century of the blockade amounts to \r\n$1,126 billion — more than $1 trillion. Nevertheless, \r\nwe have achieved undeniable results in the eradication \r\nof hunger and poverty and with health and education \r\nindicators that are renowned worldwide, as well as in \r\npromoting gender equality, equality in freedom and \r\nwell-being, social consensus, citizens’ democratic \r\n13-53496 19/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nCuriously, the United States Office of Foreign \r\nAssets Control confiscated the funds of a British \r\nnon-governmental organization intended for the \r\npurchase and distribution in the United Kingdom of a \r\nbook by a European author entitled The Economic War \r\nAgainst Cuba, published by Monthly Review Press, \r\nbased in New York. The funds of the Latin American \r\nCouncil of Churches that were intended to cover the costs \r\nof its sixth General Assembly in Havana were withheld \r\nfor three months. The humanitarian cooperation that \r\nwe extend to dozens of countries, primarily in the areas \r\nof medicine and education, is also subject to repression. \r\nThe blockade is an uncivilized act that prevents the \r\nfree circulation of persons, the free f low of information, \r\nthe exchange of ideas and the development of cultural, \r\nsporting and scientific relations.\r\nThe United States policy against Cuba suffers \r\nfrom absolute international isolation and disrepute. It \r\nlacks all ethical or legal grounds. That has been shown \r\nby the more than 180 votes in the General Assembly, \r\nthe statements made by dozens of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment in the general debate and the opinions \r\ncontributed by Member States and international \r\norganizations to the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/68/116).\r\nPresident Obama could make use of his ample \r\nconstitutional powers, without going to Congress, to \r\ngenerate a dynamic that would change the situation. \r\nAfter all, Americans elected him to bring about \r\nchange. What is to be gained from the inertia of an old, \r\nobsolete policy, borne of an antagonistic, unhealthy \r\nand ethically unacceptable confrontation that has failed \r\nfor fifty years? Why not listen to the increasingly \r\nprevailing opinion in United States society and among \r\nCuban emigrants, even in Florida, that supports the \r\nnormalization of bilateral relations and opposes the \r\nembargo and the travel ban? Why not accept the fact that \r\nwe are an independent State with equal sovereignty? \r\nWould it not be better to pragmatically renounce the \r\nideological obsession, inherited from United States \r\npoliticians of two generations ago, a policy that has \r\nnot worked, and stop spending taxpayer dollars trying, \r\nunsuccessfully, to change the Cuban Government?\r\nThe State Department’s persistence in labelling \r\nCuba, arbitrarily and without grounds, as a State that \r\nsponsors international terrorism harms the credibility \r\nof the United States, since it was precisely on United \r\nStates territory that the terrorist actions that caused the \r\nnot have access to top-quality Cuban products or \r\nCuban next-generation medicines? Why are their \r\nbusinesspeople losing opportunities? Why are \r\nbusinesses not being opened that could create jobs in \r\na time of crisis? Why can American companies not \r\nhave access to the new Mariel special development \r\nzone? The sanctions remain intact and are being fully \r\nimplemented. That is not a bilateral issue. The blockade \r\nis aggressively extraterritorial and is a violation of \r\ninternational law that damages the sovereignty of every \r\nState. It transgresses the international rules that govern \r\ntrade and the freedom of navigation. The cruel inclusion \r\nof medicines and foodstuffs violates international \r\nhumanitarian law. It is a hostile and unilateral act that \r\nshould cease unilaterally.\r\nThe blockade is the chief obstacle to broader access \r\nto the Internet and information and communication \r\ntechnologies, since it restricts our island’s bandwidth, \r\nincreases the cost of connectivity and prevents our \r\nconnecting to nearby submarine cables. The sanctions \r\nseriously restrict contacts between both peoples, \r\nand those that are authorized are subject to various \r\nconditions and are designed to produce regime change \r\nand internal destabilization. Despite the fact that \r\nWashington, D.C., has very selectively authorized \r\nsome cultural, academic and scientific exchanges, they \r\nare still severely restricted, while many projects of \r\nthat kind have not materialized, owing to the denial of \r\nlicences, visas and other bureaucratic authorizations. \r\nCuba is the only destination on the planet forbidden \r\nto United States citizens. It is a relevant constitutional \r\nissue in that American citizens are not equal before the \r\nlaw in such matters, according to whether or not they \r\nare of Cuban origin. Cuba’s national baseball team has \r\nnot been able to collect the money owed to it for its \r\nparticipation in the second and third World Baseball \r\nClassics, held in 2009 and 2013. The visas of 300 \r\nUnited States runners who intended to participate in \r\nthe 2012 Marabana marathon were denied. More than \r\n300 musicians who participated in dozens of artistic \r\nprojects in the United States have not been able to \r\nreceive their payments.\r\nCuban emigration is suffering from discriminatory \r\nmeasures. The response to the reform of Cuba’s \r\nmigration law in January has been the continued \r\nenforcement of the Cuban Adjustment Act and the “wet \r\nfoot/dry foot” policy, which encourages illegal and \r\nunsafe emigration and human trafficking, resulting in \r\nthe loss of human lives.\r\n20/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nreiterates its determination to make progress towards \r\nthe normalization of bilateral relations and reiterates \r\nits willingness to establish a serious and constructive \r\ndialogue on an equal footing and with full respect for \r\nour independence.\r\nOnce again, on behalf of the self less, heroic and \r\nfraternal people of Cuba, I ask the representatives of \r\nthe Member States to vote in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6 entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.6.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the vote, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Godard (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States strongly supports the Cuban people’s \r\ndesire to freely determine their own future. It is the \r\nCuban Government that continues to deprive the Cuban \r\npeople of the realization of that aspiration.\r\nLike all Member States, the United States conducts \r\nits economic relationships with other countries in \r\naccordance with its national interests and principles. \r\nOur sanctions policy towards Cuba is just one of the \r\ntools in our overall effort to encourage respect for \r\ncivil and human rights in a manner consistent with the \r\nUniversal Declaration, to which the United Nations \r\nitself is committed. We therefore stand in opposition \r\nto this draft resolution, and we call on all other nations \r\nthat support the Cuban people to oppose this draft \r\nresolution.\r\nThe United States places the highest priority \r\non building and strengthening connections between \r\nthe Cuban and American people. Those connections \r\ngive Cubans the support and tools they need to move \r\nforward, independent of their Government. United \r\nStates citizens engaging in well-defined, purposeful \r\ntravel remain the best ambassadors for our democratic \r\nideals. The hundreds of thousands of Americans who \r\nhave sent remittances and travelled to the island under \r\nvarious categories of purposeful travel, as promoted \r\nby President Obama, are a central part of a strategy to \r\nensure that Cubans have the opportunities they deserve.\r\ndeath of 3,478 persons and disabilities to 2,099 were \r\norganized. The notorious international terrorist Posada \r\nCarriles has found comfortable refuge in Miami, while \r\nfour of the five Cuban anti-terrorists are serving long \r\nand unjust imprisonment sentences. What is preventing \r\nthe United States Government from setting them free \r\nas a humanitarian gesture or act of justice?\r\nThe Government of Cuba, with the support of the \r\noverwhelming majority and the active participation \r\nof its people, continues to pursue a process of far-\r\nreaching economic transformation aimed at making our \r\nsocialist economy more efficient, improving the living \r\nstandards of the population and preserving the social \r\nachievements of the Revolution. Our transformations \r\nenjoy broad international recognition and ever-growing \r\ncooperation with many nations, in particular those of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, with which various \r\nforms of integration are being strengthened.\r\nThe essence of the United States policy towards \r\nCuba remains unaltered and anchored in the Cold War.\r\nThe dangers that threaten the existence of our \r\nspecies are grave and imminent. To safeguard human \r\nlife, we must safeguard peace, and to do so we need \r\na profound change in the way the world’s problems \r\nand conflicts are addressed and resolved, relying on \r\ndialogue and cooperation, without the egocentrism \r\nand the philosophy of dispossession that have led to \r\nwars and without the use of force or coercive economic \r\nmeasures, which also injure and kill in silence.\r\nIt is true that there are big differences between \r\nthe two Governments, but the only productive way to \r\nproceed is to find a civilized way to interact, recognizing \r\nthat we are neighbouring States but different States and \r\nthat it is up to each and every people to decide on its \r\nown affairs, its political system and its economy, in \r\nkeeping with its legitimate interests. We must therefore \r\nprivilege dialogue, negotiation and even cooperation, \r\nas far as possible and practicable, to the benefit of both \r\npeoples and relations in the hemisphere as a whole.\r\nThe recent resumption of talks on migration and \r\npostal services, as well as the development of contacts \r\non other issues of mutual interest, such as oil-spill \r\nresponse operations, air and sea search and rescue \r\noperations, and air and aviation safety, show that that is \r\nboth possible and useful.\r\nThe Government of Cuba, as an expression of its \r\naspirations towards peace and respectful coexistence, \r\n13-53496 21/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\ninformation and ideas through any media, as set forth \r\nin article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. To help further the enjoyment of that right, \r\nwe support Cubans in their aspirations for access to \r\nthe Internet, a goal that the Cuban Government itself \r\nnow also claims to support. The Cuban Government \r\nhas failed, however, to offer widespread access to the \r\nInternet through its high-speed cable with Venezuela or \r\nto pursue other available avenues for increasing Cubans’ \r\naccess to the Internet. Instead, it continues to impose \r\nisolation on the Cuban people, while disingenuously \r\nblaming the embargo.\r\nMoreover, the Cuban Government continues to \r\ndetain Alan Gross, an American citizen, who was \r\nsentenced to 15 years in prison for facilitating Internet \r\naccess for Cuba’s small Jewish community. The United \r\nStates calls on Cuba to release Mr. Gross and to tear \r\ndown the wall of censorship that it has erected around \r\nthe Cuban people.\r\nThe United States continues to call on the Cuban \r\nGovernment to finally allow Cuban citizens to \r\nenjoy the political and economic freedoms to which \r\nthis Organization is committed. The international \r\ncommunity cannot in good conscience ignore the ease \r\nand frequency with which the Cuban regime silences \r\ncritics, disrupts peaceful assembly, impedes independent \r\njournalism and, despite positive reforms, continues to \r\nprevent some Cubans from leaving or returning to the \r\nisland. The Cuban Government continues its tactics of \r\npolitically motivated detentions, harassment and police \r\nviolence against Cuban citizens, such as the Ladies \r\nin White, who peacefully seek freedom for political \r\nprisoners and advocate on behalf of positive political \r\nand social change. The draft resolution serves only \r\nto distract from the real problems facing the Cuban \r\npeople, and therefore, my delegation will oppose it.\r\nWe encourage this organ to support the desires of \r\nthe Cuban people to freely determine their own future. \r\nBy doing that, it would truly advance the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the purposes for \r\nwhich the United Nations was created.\r\nMs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Once again the international community is \r\nmeeting in the General Assembly to discuss and approve \r\nthe draft resolution submitted by the sister Republic \r\nof Cuba, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/68/L.6).\r\nCubans are helped by the revised travel, remittance, \r\ninformation exchange, humanitarian and people-to-\r\npeople policies, as well as the alternative sources of \r\ninformation, the chance to take advantage of emerging \r\nopportunities for self-employment and private \r\nproperty, and the strengthening of independent civil \r\nsociety. In contrast, Cuba’s draft resolution (A/68/L.6) \r\nseeks to identify an external scapegoat and excuse the \r\nCuban Government for the island’s economic problems. \r\nHowever, the Cuban Government has now publicly \r\nrecognized that those problems are caused by the very \r\neconomic policies that it has pursued for the past half-\r\ncentury.\r\nWhile we note and welcome recent changes, \r\nsuch as those that allow greater self-employment and \r\nliberalization of the real estate market, Cuba still \r\nhas one of the most restricted economic systems in \r\nthe world. Irrespective of United States policy, it is \r\nunrealistic to expect the Cuban economy to thrive until \r\nthe Cuban Government opens its State monopolies \r\nto private competition, fully empowers Cuban \r\nentrepreneurs, respects intellectual property rights, \r\nallows unfettered access to the Internet and adopts the \r\nsound macroeconomic policies that have contributed to \r\nthe success of many of Cuba’s neighbouring countries \r\nin Latin America.\r\nI want to make clear that the United States is, in \r\nfact, a deep and abiding friend of the Cuban people. In \r\n2012, the Cuban people received more than $2 billion in \r\nremittances and other private support from the United \r\nStates. That was made possible by United States policy \r\nchoices. In 2012, the United States was Cuba’s largest \r\nsupplier of food and agricultural products; it exported \r\nnearly $465 million in agricultural products, medical \r\ndevices, medicine and humanitarian items to Cuba.\r\nBy the Cuban Government’s own account, the \r\nUnited States is one of Cuba’s principal trading \r\npartners. Far from restricting aid to the Cuban people, \r\nwe are proud that the American people and United \r\nStates companies are among the leading providers \r\nof humanitarian assistance to Cuba. All of that trade \r\nand assistance is conducted in conformity with our \r\nsanctions programme, which is carefully calibrated \r\nto allow and encourage the provision of support to the \r\nCuban people.\r\nWe remain committed to policies that support \r\nthe welfare and human rights of individuals in \r\nCuba, including the right to seek, receive and impart \r\n22/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nsame explanation of vote, the same arrogance and the \r\nsame arguments to justify that absurd, out-dated, illegal \r\nand morally unsustainable policy that we hear in this \r\nAssembly year after year. Not only have those arguments \r\nbeen rejected by the international community, but every \r\nday more sectors of American society — academics, \r\nbusinessmen, members of the religious community, \r\nscientists and social organizations — are demanding \r\nan end to the blockade and the resumption of friendly \r\nand cooperative relations with Cuba, as befits two \r\nneighbours on an equal footing, without external \r\ninterference, imperial impositions, blockades or \r\ncoercive economic measures.\r\nToday, as it has done year after year, the international \r\ncommunity will respond once again in support of Cuba \r\nand for the lifting of the unjust, illegal and inhumane \r\nblockade. We will vote green — the colour of hope, of \r\nnature, of life itself — in honour of and with respect for \r\nthe people and Government of Cuba, which for over 50 \r\nyears have resisted and fought and will continue doing \r\nso, because the United States will never — and I repeat \r\nnever — break the will of that heroic people in their \r\nstruggle for their sovereignty, independence, right to \r\nself-determination and policies of solidarity, support, \r\nfraternity and brotherhood with the people of the world.\r\nAs our President, Comandante Daniel Ortega, \r\nrecently stated:\r\n“Cuba, subjected to the most brutal aggressions \r\nof the Empire, is the best testimony that peoples’ \r\nfreedom, sovereignty, justice, independence and \r\nright to peace can be defended and safeguarded, \r\nwhen a revolution,  its ideas and its principles  is \r\nundertaken by a whole population.”\r\nWe hope that the current United States \r\nAdministration will ref lect and rectify itself by voting \r\nin favour of this twenty-second draft resolution, which \r\nvoices the international community’s call for an end \r\nonce and for all to the inhuman and criminal economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade against Cuba.\r\nIt is imperative that, in the reflection on and \r\nrectification of the anachronistic and arbitrary \r\npolicies towards Cuba that we demand, the United \r\nStates Government decide once and for all to return \r\nthe occupied territory of Guantánamo; immediately \r\nand unconditionally free the five Cuban anti-terrorist \r\nheroes who have suffered in United States prisons for \r\nover 15 years, and allow them to return to their families \r\nand their people; and immediately remove Cuba from \r\nNicaragua, in explaining its vote on the draft \r\nresolution submitted by the representative of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba, takes the opportunity to add its \r\nvoice to the statements made by representatives of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nthe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, and the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. \r\nNicaragua also welcomes the statements by the \r\nrepresentatives of the Caribbean Community, the Union \r\nof South American Nations, the Southern Common \r\nMarket, the African Union, and the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation on the issue before us.\r\nWe appreciate the information provided by our \r\nfellow colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, brother Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, keeping us up \r\nto date on the resurgence of the economic suffocation \r\npolicy pursued by the United States of America through \r\nits continued economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade, the resurgence of the extraterritorial \r\ndimension of the blockade and its increased persecution \r\nof Cuba’s international financial transactions.\r\nIt is quite clear to the international community \r\nthat the blockade is the main obstacle to the economic \r\nand social development of that sister nation and its \r\ntrade ties with the world, and it is an obstacle to the \r\ninternational cooperation that Cuba gives and receives. \r\nOur colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nhas provided data revealing the depth of the effects \r\non their exports and imports; the lack of access to \r\ninternational credit; the effects on their health system, \r\neducation system — in sum, damages in all spheres of \r\nlife affecting the brotherly people of Cuba.\r\nWe have listened again, with pain and indignation, \r\nand it is increasingly reprehensible to us that a country \r\nas powerful as the United States of America should \r\ninsist on increasing the suffering of the Cuban people \r\nby continuing to violate their most basic rights to life, \r\ndevelopment, health and education.\r\nWe are astounded by the cruelty shown by the \r\nvarious United States Administrations from 1959 to \r\nthe present day against Cuba — a small, wonderful, \r\nsupportive and fraternal Caribbean island, as \r\ntransparent as its waters — only because, following \r\nits glorious revolution, it did not continue to allow the \r\nUnited States to use its island as its favourite backyard \r\non our continent.\r\nWe have just heard the representative of the United \r\nStates of America explain his country’s vote. It was the \r\n13-53496 23/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nEritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, \r\nGabon, Gambia, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, \r\nGreece, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea-Bissau, \r\nGuyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, \r\nIndia, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, \r\nIreland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, \r\nLesotho, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, \r\nLuxembourg, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, \r\nMaldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nMozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, \r\nNigeria, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South Africa, \r\nSouth Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, \r\nSwaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-Leste, \r\nTogo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, \r\nTurkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, United \r\nArab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, \r\nVanuatu, Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet \r\nNam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, United States of America\r\nAbstaining:\r\nMarshall Islands, Micronesia (Federated States of), \r\nPalau\r\nDraft resolution A/68/L.6 was adopted by 188 votes \r\nto 2, with 3 abstentions (resolution 68/8).\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to those \r\nrepresentatives wishing to explain their votes on the \r\nresolution just adopted.\r\nMrs. Kazragienė (Lithuania): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU)and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland \r\nand Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nthe list of countries that sponsor terrorism, which is \r\nnothing more than a justification by the United States \r\nof America for intensifying its practices and policies \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nNicaragua reaffirms its well-known position of \r\nsupport for and complete solidarity with the brotherly \r\npeople and Government of Cuba. As always, we will \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution on the issue \r\n(A/68/L.6). That affirmative vote will ref lect the \r\ngratitude of hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguans who \r\nhave received the militant solidarity of the brotherly \r\npeople and Government of Cuba in our struggle for our \r\npolitical and economic independence.\r\nThe United States no longer has any argument; \r\nthe international community knows it and so does the \r\nUnited States. The result of the vote will be more than \r\nclear. The United States of America, in its imperial \r\nobsession with trying to defeat that heroic people \r\nthrough its blockade, has become a State that violates \r\nand disrespects the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law \r\nand the only obstructionist State to the agreement of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to immediately end this cruel and \r\ninhuman blockade against Cuba.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.6, entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, \r\nCambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Cabo Verde, \r\nCentral African Republic, Chad, Chile, China, \r\nColombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Denmark, \r\nDjibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, \r\nEcuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, \r\n24/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nof the Cuban citizens to make independent decisions \r\nabout their future. We reiterate our call on the Cuban \r\nGovernment to fully grant its citizens internationally \r\nrecognized civil, political and economic rights and \r\nfreedoms, including the freedom of assembly, freedom \r\nof expression and free access to information. We call \r\non it to ratify the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights and the Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights and, following the visit of \r\nthe United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right \r\nto food, to extend invitations to other rapporteurs to \r\nvisit Cuba. In that context, we welcome the adoption \r\nof a new migration law by the Cuban Government as \r\nan important step towards the freedom of movement of \r\nCuban citizens.\r\nThe existing restrictions on rights and freedoms \r\nundermine and offset the Cuban achievements in \r\nhealth care and education. Similarly, domestic Cuban \r\neconomic policy seriously hampers its own economic \r\ndevelopment. In that context, we note the adoption \r\nby the Cuban Parliament in August 2011 of a package \r\nof economic and social reforms, and we expect that \r\nthose reforms will be extended and implemented in a \r\nmanner that will address the key concerns of the Cuban \r\npopulation.\r\nThe economic, commercial, and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States contributes to the \r\neconomic problems in Cuba, negatively affecting the \r\nliving standards of the Cuban people. The lifting of the \r\nUnited States embargo would facilitate an opening of \r\nthe Cuban economy, to the benefit of the Cuban people.\r\nTogether, we again express our rejection of all \r\nunilateral measures directed against Cuba that are \r\ncontrary to commonly accepted rules of international \r\ntrade. We urge the Cuban authorities to bring about real \r\nimprovements in all the areas mentioned.\r\nIn spite of continued concerns and criticisms on \r\nthe aforementioned human rights situation in Cuba, \r\nthe member States of the European Union unanimously \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 68/8.\r\nMs. King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines voted in favour of \r\nresolution 68/8.\r\nWe align ourselves fully with the statements made \r\nearlier today by representatives who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe Caribbean Community, the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, and the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well the Republic of \r\nMoldova, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe United States trade policy towards Cuba is \r\nfundamentally a bilateral issue. However, American \r\nlegislation such as the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 \r\nand the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 has extended the \r\neffects of the United States embargo to third-party \r\ncountries. In the framework of the common commercial \r\npolicy, the European Union has firmly and continuously \r\nopposed such extraterritorial measures.\r\nWe appreciate the decision of the Government of \r\nthe United States to lift restrictions on remittances \r\nand family travel to Cuba, but we cannot accept that \r\nunilaterally imposed measures impede our economic \r\nand commercial relations with that country. \r\nTo address the problem, in November 1996, the \r\nEU Council of Ministers adopted a regulation and a \r\njoint action to protect the interests of natural or legal \r\npersons residing in Europe against the consequences \r\nof those Acts. Furthermore, at the summit between the \r\nEuropean Union and the United States held in London \r\nin May 1998, a package was agreed that also sought \r\nto alleviate the problems brought by extraterritorial \r\nlegislation. It covered waivers to Titles III and IV of \r\nthe Helms-Burton Act, a commitment by the United \r\nStates Government to resist future extraterritorial \r\nlegislation of that kind, and an understanding regarding \r\nthe disciplines for the strengthening of investment \r\nprotection. It is urgent that the United States implement \r\nthat agreement.\r\nThe European Union’s policy towards Cuba was \r\nset out in a common position in 1996. Reaffirming the \r\nvalidity of the common position, the European Union \r\nin June 2008 lifted the restrictive measures imposed \r\non Cuba in 2003. The dialogue with the authorities \r\nin Havana was resumed without preconditions and \r\non the basis of reciprocity and non-discrimination. \r\nFive political dialogue ministerial sessions have been \r\nheld with the Cuban Government addressing issues of \r\ncommon interest, including human rights — a question \r\nat the core of relations with all third countries, including \r\nCuba.\r\nWe reaffirm our determination to pursue a \r\ncomprehensive, results-oriented dialogue with the \r\nCuban authorities and with representatives of civil \r\nsociety and the peaceful pro-democracy opposition, \r\nin accordance with EU policies. We reiterate the right \r\n13-53496 25/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\npeople have rolled up their sleeves and given freely of \r\nthemselves in a manner that has touched the hearts and \r\nsouls of the Vincentian people. No dollar amount can \r\nadequately reflect the value of that support, solidarity \r\nand partnership, for which the Cuban people have \r\nasked nothing in return. Our appreciation cannot be \r\noverstated.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to \r\nhope for an evolution in the thinking and actions of our \r\nfriends in the United States of America on the matter \r\nbefore us today, and we remain unequivocal in our call \r\nfor the removal of that constraint on the development of \r\nour Caribbean neighbour.\r\nMr. Sin Son Ho (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): It is my pleasure to speak before the General \r\nAssembly on the important agenda item before \r\nus, namely, the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba.\r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade earlier by representatives who spoke on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and other regional groups.\r\nTwenty years have passed since the United Nations \r\nstarted its debates on ending the unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. The United \r\nStates blockade against Cuba is the legacy of the Cold \r\nWar. It is intended to overthrow the legitimate social \r\nsystem chosen by the Cuban people, and it has turned \r\nthat country into a quiet backyard of the United States.\r\nDue to the United States embargo, the new \r\ndevelopment efforts by the Cuban Government to \r\nimprove the livelihood and social welfare of the \r\nCuban people have encountered great obstacles. \r\nTo make things worse, the United States Congress \r\npassed the Helms-Burton Act, expanding sanctions to \r\nother countries that wanted to develop economic and \r\ntrade relations with Cuba. That is an inhumane and \r\nundemocratic action, a mockery of the common efforts \r\nof the regional countries for peaceful development. The \r\nUnited States embargo against Cuba clearly constitutes \r\na grave violation against basic rights and human rights \r\nof the Cuban people.\r\nThe anti-Cuban blockade is also a wanton \r\nviolation of principles stipulated in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations on the right to self-determination, \r\nsovereign equality, non-interference in internal affairs \r\nThe embargo has been and continues to be a violation \r\nof international law. It is contrary to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Charter. We take the \r\nf loor at this time to re-emphasize our deeply held \r\nconviction that the ongoing embargo has served only to \r\ncause undue suffering to the Cuban people.\r\nIn his inaugural address to the United Nations in \r\n2009, President Obama told us:\r\n“No one nation can or should try to dominate another \r\nnation. No world order that elevates one nation or \r\ngroup of people over another will succeed ... The \r\ntraditional divisions between nations of the South \r\nand the North make no sense in an interconnected \r\nworld, nor do alignments of nations rooted in \r\nthe cleavages of a long-gone cold war. The time \r\nhas come to realize that the old habits, the old \r\narguments, are irrelevant to the challenges faced \r\nby our peoples... The world must stand together to \r\ndemonstrate that international law is not an empty \r\npromise.” (A/64/PV.3, pp. 10-11)\r\nWe must continue to ask ourselves what place \r\nthis embargo has in our modern world. And in \r\nan interconnected world of open borders and the \r\nfree movement of people, goods and capital, how \r\ncan the champions and architects of globalization \r\nsimultaneously legislate the isolation of one State or \r\nplace extraterritorial restrictions on commerce, global \r\ntrade and the movement of individuals? How can the \r\nelectorate of one country or one constituency or one \r\ndistrict determine the cargo and path of a ship sailing \r\ninto and out of Cuban waters, or the manner in which \r\nbanks and corporations of other countries conduct their \r\nbusiness with Cuba?\r\nVersions of resolution 68/8, adopted today, have \r\nbeen introduced for the past 21 sessions of the General \r\nAssembly and have enjoyed near-unanimous support \r\nfor years. There is no other example of the international \r\ncommunity speaking so overwhelmingly and so \r\nconsistently. However, the embargo remains stubbornly \r\nin place, and its negative impacts have intensified since \r\nthe recent global financial crisis.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is aware that our \r\nsmall population and economy and the waning military \r\nsignificance of the Caribbean region have allowed our \r\nneeds and concerns to be overlooked by many. As far \r\nwealthier nations and institutions have looked askance \r\nat our developmental struggles and offer only dubious \r\nprescriptions, platitudes and trite clichés, the Cuban \r\n26/27 13-53496\r\nA/68/PV.38 29/10/2013\r\nsolution, one that would restore the relations that \r\nexisted between the two peoples and countries long \r\nbefore the embargo was imposed. We are encouraged \r\nby the steps taken by the United States since 2009. We \r\nsee the lifting of the restrictions on family travel and \r\nremittances to Cuba, the expansion of humanitarian \r\nexports and the review of regulations for United States \r\ntelecommunications companies, among others, as \r\npromising steps. Much more needs to be done.\r\nOn 4 April 2002, then United States President \r\nGeorge W. Bush observed, in his remarks on the Trade \r\nPromotion Authority Legislation and Extension of the \r\nAndean Trade Preference Act:\r\n“[T]rade creates the habits of freedom [which \r\ncreate] the expectations of democracy and demands \r\nfor better democratic institutions. Societies that are \r\nopen to commerce across their borders are more \r\nopen to democracy within their borders.\r\n“And for those of us who care about values, \r\nbelieve in values, not just American values, but \r\nuniversal values that promote human dignity, trade \r\nis a good way to do that.”\r\nWe agree with former President Bush. Commercial \r\nengagement is the best way to encourage more open \r\nsocieties. Indeed, ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba would be a \r\ngreat victory for the values that we have collectively \r\nundertaken to uphold, values enshrined in the Charter \r\nof this Organization.\r\nMrs. Perceval (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina’s vote in favour of resolution 68/8 reaffirms \r\nthe rejection by the Government and people of the \r\nArgentine nation of that type of unilateral, illegal and \r\nillegitimate measure. The economic sanctions imposed \r\nby the United States since 1962, called an embargo, can \r\nbe interpreted by some only as a trade and financial \r\nwar, which could be highly criticized, but let there be \r\nno mistake. Its substance, its main goal is political, \r\nagainst the Government of the Republic of Cuba and \r\nagainst what the Cuban people have freely chosen as a \r\nway of life.\r\nThose measures are not merely arbitrary and \r\nillegal. They also run counter to what the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations have been demanding \r\nfor more than 20 years. Over the years, Governments of \r\nthe United States have put forward various arguments \r\npublicly to justify the blockade. However, we know that \r\nthe public arguments have changed. But if we look at \r\nand freedom of trade. It is a typical example of a \r\nextraterritorial act to force another country to change \r\nits political, economic and social system according to \r\na particular country’s values. That cannot be justified \r\nunder any circumstances. Ending the unilateral \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba is today the unanimous \r\ndemand of the Member States of the United Nations, \r\nincluding Cuba, that aspire to sustainable development \r\nin a peaceful environment.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea strongly \r\ncondemns the United States for the embargo against the \r\nCuban people and demands the immediate lifting of this \r\nsanction, in accordance with the many relevant United \r\nNations resolutions. Based on its consistent stand to \r\noppose all sorts of interference and sanctions against \r\na sovereign State, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, as in the past, voted in support of the resolution \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba (resolution 68/8).\r\nOnce again, we strongly urge the United States to \r\nimmediately abandon its blockade against Cuba.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our support for and solidarity \r\nwith the Cuban Government and people in their struggle \r\nto safeguard their national dignity and sovereignty \r\nagainst the United States’ attempt at a unilateral \r\nblockade.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nThe unilateral sanctions imposed against Cuba and \r\nits people have endured for over 50 years and have not \r\nengendered the intended consequences. That is why we \r\nhave often appealed to our friend, the United States, \r\nthat it is about time they were brought to an end. Today, \r\nonce again, in adopting resolution 68/8 we in this \r\nAssembly joined to reiterate our collective call for the \r\nunconditional cessation of the embargo against Cuba.\r\nFor 50 years the sanctions have had no evident \r\neffect except as a curtailment of the basic right of \r\nordinary Cubans to development and happiness. We \r\nbelieve that ending the sanctions would have obvious \r\neconomic benefits for both Cuba and the United States. \r\nAs a friend and ally of the United States and Cuba, we \r\nsee a glittering light at the end of the tunnel. There is \r\nhope on the horizon, hope for a lasting solution to an \r\nunfortunate situation.\r\nWe hope and believe that both the United States \r\nand the Cuban Governments can work towards a lasting \r\n13-53496 27/27\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.38\r\nimpair the equality of opportunities. Thus, Law 24871 \r\nestablishes the normative framework with respect to the \r\nreach of foreign laws on Argentine territory. It provides \r\nthat foreign laws will be absolutely inapplicable and \r\nwithout any legal effect if they are intended to cause \r\nextraterritorial legal effects through imposing an \r\neconomic blockade or by limiting investment in a given \r\ncountry in order to bring about a change of Government \r\nin that country or to have an effect on the right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nIt is unacceptable that, despite the repeated and \r\npractically unanimous appeal of the international \r\ncommunity, especially by the General Assembly, for \r\nelimination of the embargo against Cuba, that embargo \r\npersists. Cuba is suffering unilateral aggression \r\ndisguised as mere commercial aggression. I insist \r\nthat that is unjustified. We must stress the fact that \r\nmultilateralism defends true democracy throughout \r\nthe world. True democracy means acknowledging that \r\nfreedom is the condition of liberation. Some countries \r\nsimply understand that freedom is freedom of the \r\nmarket and subjugate other countries to military or \r\neconomic hegemony.\r\nLastly, Argentina reiterates its position against \r\nsuch measures. We stand together with Cuba as an \r\nactive member of the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States. With passion, agreement and \r\nconviction, we shall continue to fully implement the \r\nprovisions of resolution 68/8.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\nthe documents of the various Administrations, we see \r\nthe real reason behind the maintenance of the blockade. \r\nIt is what has been said since the very beginning, that \r\nits goal is to increase discomfort among the Cuban \r\npeople through hunger and thus to bring about despair \r\nand the fall of the Government.\r\nThat endeavour has already failed. It has failed, \r\nnot just because of the courage of the Cuban people, \r\nbut because the international community has just \r\nexpressed itself, with an overwhelming majority, in \r\nfavour of putting an end to the unfair, arbitrary and \r\nillegal measure.\r\nArgentina is firmly committed to multilateralism \r\nas a legitimate instrument for the settlement of disputes \r\nbetween States. We believe that the embargo against \r\nCuba, far from resolving disputes, creates new ones. It \r\nviolates the rules of international law and the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. As the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba just said, it blocks a free people \r\nfrom access to minimum goods for health, technology \r\nand education. In fact, here, in the United Nations, \r\nwhere we support and want a more just international \r\norder, in reality, the disproportionate exercise of the \r\neconomic clout of one nation against a weaker one \r\nnot only is unequal but accentuates the inequality and \r\ndistances us from true multilateralism.\r\nArgentina defends free trade, but not through the \r\nsurvival of the fittest or the law of the jungle. Free trade \r\nis also trade that is free of arbitrary impositions that \r\n"
