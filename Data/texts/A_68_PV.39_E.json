"In the absence of the President, Mr. Rosenthal \r\n(Guatemala), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m. \r\nAgenda item 40 (continued)\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/116)\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nspeakers in explanation of vote or position, I would \r\nlike to remind delegations that explanations of vote are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats. \r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands): Solomon Islands \r\nvoted today in favour of resolution 68/8, “Necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”. \r\nSolomon Islands commends Cuba for taking the \r\nmost peaceful path in seeking the unconditional lifting \r\nof the blockade through the United Nations. This is \r\nthe only place where we the international community, \r\ncountries big and small, gather to ensure that what is \r\nmoral is upheld, what is right is respected, and what \r\nmust be undone is lifted. \r\nWe continue to believe that each and every country \r\nhas inalienable rights to define and determine its own \r\npolitical system and to participate in international trade. \r\nThese are the fundamental principles of international \r\nlaw. The 53-year-old coercive economic, financial and \r\ncommercial blockade on Cuba has an adverse impact on \r\nthe people of Cuba and hampers their development and \r\nprogress, as indicated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in document A/68/116. This morning Solomon \r\nIslands was one of the 188 countries that voted in favour \r\nof the resolution. \r\nFor the past 22 years, since 1991, the world has \r\nannually called on our partner and friend, the United \r\nStates of America, to end the economic, financial \r\nand commercial blockade against the peaceful people \r\nof Cuba. The resolution reaffirms a commitment of \r\nSolomon Islands and the General Assembly to the \r\nprinciples, letter and spirit of the Charter of the United \r\nNations — respect for the principles of sovereign \r\nequality among member States, and non-interference \r\nand non-intervention in the domestic and internal \r\naffairs of another State. \r\nThe world is changing, and changing fast. We \r\nspeak of rights. Let us uphold those rights. We speak of \r\nfreedom. Let us respect each State’s freedom to adopt \r\nits own political system. We speak of the rule of law. Let \r\nus conduct ourselves in conformity with international \r\nlaw. We speak of multilateralism. Let us do away with \r\nunilateralism. \r\nSolomon Islands has continued to develop and \r\nbolster its relations with both the United States and \r\nCuba. We have more than 100 medical students \r\nstudying in Cuba. As part of growing relations, we \r\nhave established an embassy in Havana this year. The \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.39\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n39th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 29 October 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Belarus does not cease to admire the courage of \r\nthe Cuban people, who continue to fight to defend their \r\nState, national digity and sovereignty. \r\nBelarus is proud to support the Cuban sisters and \r\nbrothers and calls for for an end to the blockade against \r\nthe Cuban people. We voted in favour of resolution \r\n68/8, with more than 180 other Members of the United \r\nNations.\r\nMr. Chipaziwa (Zimbabwe): We associate \r\nourselves with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, the representative of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and by \r\nthe representative of Ethiopia on behalf of the African \r\nStates (see A/68/PV.38).\r\nWe voted for resolution 68/8. Zimbabwe once again \r\nexpresses its deep concern over the continuation of \r\nthe comprehensive unilateral economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade imposed against the Republic \r\nof Cuba. Those vicious sanctions, which have spanned \r\nmore than half a century, continue to inflict severe \r\neconomic hardships on the people of Cuba. Similarly \r\nthe economic sanctions prohibit Cuba from reaching its \r\nmaximum potential for trade, economic development \r\nand prosperity. The economic blockade also undermines \r\nCuba’s right to development.\r\nFor twenty-one consecutive years the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the international community represented \r\nin this Hall have consistently demanded the lifting \r\nof the trade embargo against Cuba. However, the \r\nAssembly’s call to lift it have been met with complete \r\ndefiance. Zimbabwe is of the view that any reasons for \r\nthe continuation of the economic blockade of Cuba are \r\nindefensible, hypocritical and counterproductive. The \r\nmajority of the Member States of the United Nations \r\nhave consistently rejected the passing of national laws \r\nwith extraterritorial impact, and all other coercive \r\neconomic measures, including unilateral sanctions \r\nwhich are targeted mainly at developing countries that \r\nseek to reassert their sovereignty. As a victim of those \r\nPacific Islands Forum admitted Cuba as a Post Forum \r\nDialogue Partner. Cuba joins the United States as a \r\nDialogue Partner in my region.\r\nIn closing, Solomon Islands calls for the full \r\nimplementation of the resolution and hopes to see the \r\nlifting of the embargo give way to a peaceful coexistence \r\nbetween two great States, the United States and Cuba, \r\nas a spirit and constructive engagement unites two very \r\nclose neighbours.\r\nMr. Pisarevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Today, \r\njust as has been the case for more than two decades, the \r\nmajority of the Member States of the United Nations, \r\nincluding the Republic of Belarus, advocated in the \r\nGeneral Assembly a clear and valid demand to put an \r\nend to the economic, commercial and financil embargo \r\nof Cuba.\r\nWe are convinced that it is an uncivilized and \r\nunconstructive way of dealing with disputes in \r\ncontemporary international relations. The Republic of \r\nBelarus continues to deem any unilateral economic \r\nmeasures to be a means of exerting political and \r\neconomic pressure against developing countries. We \r\nbelieve they are contrary to the basic principles of \r\ninternational law and the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and other international \r\nlegal documents. \r\nWe advocate the inalienable right of every State to \r\ndetermine its own development model. Any unilateral \r\nattempts by any States to involve themselves in the \r\ninternal political affairs of other States by using \r\nmilitary, political, economic or other forms of pressure \r\nare not acceptable.\r\nBelarus calls upon the United States to undertake \r\npolicies based on unconditional respect for the \r\ncommonly recognized principles of international law \r\nin its relations with Cuba and any other countries in \r\nregard to which it is taking coercive measures. Those \r\nprinciples include the sovereign equality of States and \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs, and respect for \r\nthe freedom of international trade and internatonal \r\nmerchant shipping.\r\nAt the same time, we believe we must ensure \r\nthat the Secretary-General, the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights and other \r\nrepresentatives of the United Nations having \r\nresponsibilities in international affairs in the areas \r\nof peace, security, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are more involved in the problem of \r\n13-53630 3/8\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.39\r\nStates and non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nMember States, and to the international instruments \r\npertaining to human rights, international humanitarian \r\nlaw and the principles of international trade.\r\nRegrettably, and despite several resolutions adopted \r\nby the General Assembly by an overwhelming majority \r\nand several resolutions adopted by other regional, \r\nspecialized and political organizations, the economic, \r\nfinancial and commercial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba since 1959 is still in force \r\ntoday, as if nothing had happened. The support by 188 \r\nMember States for resolution 68/8 during this session \r\nonce more reaffirms that the Member States do not see \r\nany legal basis for the embargo imposed on Cuba, and \r\nthat it must be lifted.\r\nThe fact that, in this very Hall, Israel voted against \r\nthe resolution only confirms that it does not respect \r\ninternational law and that it violates international law, \r\nclearly supporting illegitimate practices against the \r\nrights of Member States of the United Nations. \r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic confirms that the \r\nunilateral coercive economic measures imposed by the \r\nUnited States and the European Union against Syria are \r\na f lagrant violation of the principles of international \r\nlaw. They represent a hegemonic tool of the West and \r\nserve only the purposes of oppression and economic and \r\npolitical coercion. Such measures seek to undermine \r\nthe independence of national political decisions and to \r\ninterfere in the internal affairs of Member States in a \r\nway that runs counter to the provisions of the Charter. \r\nThey are also a manifestation of a policy of collective \r\npunishment that those States pursue.\r\nSuch illegitimate and unjust measures can only \r\nfoment negative feelings towards the West, as the \r\nmajority of such measures have been imposed by \r\nWestern States, particularly the United States of \r\nAmerica and the States of the European Union. Such \r\nmeasures seek to weaken the Governments of other \r\nMember States or to bring pressure to bear on those \r\nGovernments in order to force them to change their \r\nnational policies.\r\nMy country reiterates its condemnation of the \r\nsanctions imposed by the United States of America and \r\nthe European Union on the Syrian people. We stress \r\nthe toll of and adverse effects that such illegitimate \r\nunilateral measures have had on the life and prosperity \r\nof our people. Such unilateral illegitimate measures \r\nprevent Syrians from meeting their basic needs, \r\nvery same ill-conceived illegal, immoral sanctions, \r\nZimbabwe fully understands their impact.\r\nZimbabwe shares the view that the trade \r\nembargo against Cuba contravenes the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations in regard to all the norms and \r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States. \r\nThe sanctions constitute an egregious violation of \r\nfundamental norms of international law, as they \r\ninfringe on the sovereignty of Cuba. Furthermore, the \r\nembargo is a violation of the principles of the sovereign \r\nequality of States and non-interference in one another’s \r\ndomestic affairs.\r\nLastly, the embargo against Cuba is contrary to \r\naccepted international trade regulations. Zimbabwe \r\ntherefore joins other countries in condemning the \r\npernicious trade embargo against Cuba and calls for its \r\nimmediate and unconditional lifting in order to enable \r\nthe people of Cuba to pursue their economic and social \r\ndestiny. That, by any definition, cannot constitute a \r\nthreat to any other State.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, let me welcome the presence of \r\nHis Excellency Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and renew our total support \r\nto the Government and people of Cuba in the face of the \r\nembargo imposed by the United States against Cuba.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, as \r\nwell as the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nFiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/68/\r\nPV.38).\r\nThe embargo imposed on Cuba for several decades \r\nhas created an unacceptable precedent in dealings \r\nbetween Member States in a manner that is contrary \r\nto international law. It has unnecessarily subjected \r\nthe people of Cuba to several economic, social and \r\npolitical hardship. It has deepened the suffering of the \r\nCuban people and placed the United States in direct \r\nconfrontation with the universal consensus rejects the \r\nembargo, an embargo that has so far caused losses of \r\nmore than a trillion dollars for Cuba. \r\nFor the twenty-second year, the General Assembly \r\nis meeting to reaffirm, by an overwhelming majority, \r\nthe illegitimacy and inhumanity of the embargo \r\nimposed by the United States on Cuba and its people. \r\nThe embargo is contrary to the provisions of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the principles of international \r\nlaw, notably the principle of equal sovereignty among \r\n4/8 13-53630\r\nA/68/PV.39 29/10/2013\r\nof resolution 68/8, entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. \r\nFirst, we would like to highlight the fact that this \r\nis the first time that El Salvador is making a statement \r\non the embargo before the General Assembly. In a \r\nstatement he made in the general debate last September, \r\nPresident Mauricio Funes Cartagena said: \r\n“[We] advocate once again for the lifting of the \r\nblockade against Cuba... as I believe that Cuba is \r\npart of the American soul and that the blockade \r\nis a relic of the past. The brotherly people of \r\nCuba, like all peoples of the world, have the right \r\nto seek development and well-being through \r\ncomprehensive integration.” (A/68/PV.10, p. 4) \r\nIn that context, El Salvador would like to reiterate \r\nthe importance of fulfilling the provisions of resolution \r\n47/19 of 24 November 1992, which emphasizes the need \r\nto put an end to the financial, commercial, economic \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba and calls for an end to that the embargo. \r\nIt also indicates that under Cuban jurisdiction, the \r\napplication of national laws with extraterritorial effect \r\nviolates the legitimate interests of the people as well \r\nas the right to all forms of trade and navigation. Those \r\nlaws are an impediment to all efforts by the Cuban \r\npeople to ensure social and economic development. \r\nMoreover, the mechanisms currently in place to \r\nimpose the embargo violate the principles governing \r\nglobal economic, commercial, monetary and financial \r\nrelations as well as numerous resolutions of the United \r\nNations and many other international organizations.\r\nEl Salvador reiterates the call contained in a special \r\ncommuniqué issued by a number of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment from South America who met in Panama \r\nCity at the twenty-third Ibero-American Summit, held \r\non 18 and 19 October. They reaffirmed free exchange \r\nand transparent practices in international trade and \r\nrejected unilateral coercive measures that affect the \r\nwell-being of all peoples and their access to and full \r\nenjoyment of the benefits of international cooperation \r\nin all arenas, and impede the process of integration. One \r\nsuch case is the financial, commercial and economic \r\nblockade of the United States against Cuba. \r\nTo conclude, I underscore and defend the Cuban \r\ncause, and demand an end to the embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States, which has caused enormous damage to \r\nthe people and has made no headway towards attaining \r\nin terms of access to medications, food, medical \r\nequipment, fuel for heating, agricultural needs, civil \r\naviation transportation services and communications \r\nequipment. Besides harming the country’s economy, \r\nsuch measures also constitute a violation of the \r\ncollective human rights of the Syrian people.\r\nIn that context, we recall that the imposition of \r\ncoercive unilateral measures is a violation of the relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, including resolution \r\n66/186, entitled “Unilateral economic measures as \r\na means of political and economic coercion against \r\ndeveloping countries” and resolution 66/156, entitled \r\n“Human rights and unilateral coercive measures”, in \r\nwhich the General Assembly stressed its condemnation \r\nand rejection of unilateral economic measures, as it \r\nconsidered such measures to be an impediment to \r\nhealthy trade relations among States and an obstruction \r\nto the full realization of the rights provided for in the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights and other \r\ninternational human rights instruments. In that context, \r\nI would mention the right of individuals and peoples to \r\ndevelopment. Such measures prevent the enjoyment by \r\neach and every individual of a standard of living that \r\nensures enjoyment of the rights to health, prosperity \r\nand access to food, medical treatment, education and \r\nthe necessary social services. \r\nIn accordance with its mandate, the General \r\nAssembly is called upon to take the necessary measures \r\nto put an end to the unilateral, unjust and hostile \r\nembargoes and economic sanctions policies that are \r\nbeing pursued by some States of the Organization in \r\nviolation of international law.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would hope that all \r\nforms of embargo and unilateral sanctions imposed \r\nby the United States on Cuba and many other States, \r\nincluding my country, Syria, will be brought to an end. \r\nMy country also hopes that the illegitimate, immoral \r\nand inhumane embargo imposed by Israel on the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, including the occupied \r\nGolan, will be lifted as well. We hope that the voice \r\nof the international community, as expressed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and other international institutions \r\nand organizations, will be respected by the United \r\nStates of America and fully taken into account by its \r\nlegislative institutions. Accordingly, Syria has voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 68/8. \r\nMs. Rivera Sánchez (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to make the following general \r\nstatement after the voting. El Slavador voted in favour \r\n13-53630 5/8\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.39\r\nRepresentative of the Islamic of Republic of Iran \r\non behalf the Non-Aligned Movement, and by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Fiji on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China (see A/68/PV.38). \r\nWe are here today to express our sympathy to \r\nthe innocent and peace-loving people of Cuba, who \r\nhave continued to endure the misery resulting from \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed against them. That embargo has impeded \r\nthe Cuban Government’s efforts to eliminate poverty, \r\npromote economic and social development and achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Moreover, the \r\nembargo violates international law, goes against the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nconstitutes a transgression of the rights of sovereign \r\nStates to peace, development and security. \r\nIn accordance with resolution 68/8, Member \r\nStates must neither promulgate nor enforce any \r\nlaw, regulation or measure that jeopardizes the \r\nsovereign right of Member States to participate in the \r\ninternational financial and commercial system. Based \r\non the universal principle of sovereign equality under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law, \r\nno nation has the right to interfere in the internal affairs \r\nof another nation, despite any differences that may \r\nexist in their sociopolitical systems. As a sovereign and \r\nindependent nation, the Republic of Cuba has the right \r\nto choose its own political system, as well as its path of \r\ndevelopment, based on its specific conditions. \r\nIn 2012, 188 Member States voted in favour of \r\nresolution 67/4 on this item, and this year again 188 \r\nMember States voted in favour of resolution 68/8 on the \r\nsame item. That is irrefutable proof that the battle for \r\nthe lifting of the blockade is recognized and supported \r\nby the vast majority of the international community. \r\nTherefore, the blockade must be lifted immediately and \r\nunconditionally. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\njoins the majority of Member States in supporting the \r\nCuban people in that fight. As Members of the United \r\nNations, we should do everything we can to help Cuba \r\nto fully reclaim its legitimate right to integrate into the \r\nglobalized economy. \r\nIn that spirit, my delegation voted in favour of \r\nresolution 68/8, entitled “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”. \r\nMr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nwe wish to align ourselves with the statement made by \r\nthe goals set by those who originally advocated it. In \r\naddition, I reiterate the deep sympathy and solidarity \r\nof the people and Government of El Salvador with the \r\npeople and Government of Cuba in this cause. There \r\nso many reasons to dismantle this anachronism in the \r\ntwenty-first-century. \r\nMr. Aung Kyaw Zan (Myanmar): I am taking the \r\nf loor to explain my delegation’s position on resolution \r\n68/8, which was adopted this morning. \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, and by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (see \r\nA/68/PV.38).\r\nIn keeping with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, Myanmar has always \r\nstrived to promote respect for the sovereign equality \r\nand territorial equality of States. Similarly, as a \r\nmember of the Non-Aligned Movement, Myanmar has \r\nsteadfastly adhered to the principled position of the \r\nMovement in opposing the use of unilateral trade and \r\neconomic sanctions that have been imposed against \r\nsome members of the Movement for the purpose of \r\nexerting political pressure. \r\nAs a country that has experienced similar unilateral \r\nsanctions before, Myanmar fully understands that \r\nthe imposition of sanctions on developing countries \r\ncan have a devastating impact on the efforts of those \r\ncountries to achieve sustainable development. Myanmar \r\ntherefore supports the final document adopted at the \r\nsixteenth Summit of Heads of State and Government of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, which calls \r\nfor the international community to adopt all necessary \r\nmeasures to put an end to the embargo against the \r\npeople and Government of Cuba and protect the \r\nsovereign right of all other countries to expand trade \r\nand economic relations with Cuba.\r\nIn line with previous United Nations resolutions on \r\nthis item, we firmly believe that constructive dialogue \r\nis needed to foster mutual trust and understanding, as \r\nwell as harmony and peaceful coexistence among the \r\nnations of the world. It was in that context that Myanmar \r\nvoted in favour of the resolution.\r\nMr. Khitchadeth (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): At the outset, I would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/68/116) under \r\nthis agenda item. My delegation wishes to associate \r\nitself with the statements made by the Permanent \r\n6/8 13-53630\r\nA/68/PV.39 29/10/2013\r\nThat being said, I wonder — and we believe that this \r\nAssembly agrees with us — how the United Nations can \r\ndraw up a road map for a post-2015 development agenda, \r\ncombat poverty and achieve sustainable development \r\nwhile we face laws that hinder international trade and \r\nimpose blockades and embargoes on countries that are \r\nstriving to achieve a life with dignity for their people \r\nand the right livelihood for their nations. How can we \r\nsave lives, ensure medication, help the elderly, children \r\nand the poor while there are countries that deprive \r\npeople of their basic needs to live and survive? We do \r\nnot believe that such actions represent the principles for \r\nwhich the United Nations was established. \r\nToday, I call upon the President of this important \r\nforum, which represents the voice of all humankind, \r\nand the Secretary-General — and I know that both the \r\nAssembly and the Secretary-General wish to promote \r\nthe principles of this international Organization — to \r\nspeak out, as representatives have already done, and \r\nreject any unilateral measures that can undermine the \r\nproper foundations of international relations. \r\nWe have heard many previous speakers list the \r\nunilateral economic measures imposed by certain \r\nStates. Those measures are in line with other coercive \r\nsteps that go beyond the sphere of trade and affect other \r\nsectors, such as the refusal to grant Heads of State visas \r\nand preventing them from attending the meetings of \r\nthe General Assembly, as happened to His Excellency \r\nMr. Al-Bashir, President of the Republic of the Sudan. \r\nSuch measures undermine the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations. Moreover, if they continue, they will \r\nundermine the lofty principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the foremost among them being \r\nthe equal sovereignty between States and the promotion \r\nof friendly relations among States. \r\nThat is why we look to the President and the \r\nSecretary-General to raise their voices and reject \r\nmeasures, such as the one by the United States of \r\nAmerica that deprived the President of the Sudan an \r\nentry visa in violation of the host country agreement. \r\nThat is a unilateral measure similar to the unilateral \r\neconomic embargo on Cuba and the Sudan, which has \r\nbeen in effect for many decades. We strongly call upon \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, as it is his moral \r\nresponsibility to stop any measures that violate the \r\nhost country agreement. That is why this morning the \r\nSudan voted in favour of resolution 68/8, which calls \r\nfor putting an end to the unfair economic embargo. \r\nthe representative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and with those made on behalf of the African \r\nGroup and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba (see A/68/PV.38).\r\nWe welcome the presence of the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba in the Assembly today. \r\nWe confirm that we support Cuba’s position, as \r\nexpressed by the aforementioned representatives and \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs. For many decades, \r\nthe General Assembly, the most representative and \r\nsignificant organ of the United Nations, has called for \r\nan end to that coercive measure, which contravenes \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law, namely, the unilateral and \r\nextraterritorial economic blockade against Cuba. \r\nHowever, that call has been made in vain. \r\nThe overwhelming majority of Member States have \r\nbeen calling for an end to that blockade. Today once \r\nagain, the General Assembly affirmed its position, \r\nwhen 188 Member States voted in favour of resolution \r\n68/8. My country, the Sudan, also voted in favour of that \r\nresolution. We have listened to the representatives of \r\nseveral Member States, who stated that the imposition \r\nof extraterritorial law contravenes the principles of the \r\nequal sovereignty of States and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States. That is an issue that we all \r\nagree on. However, we have failed to put an end to that \r\npractice to date. \r\nUnfortunately, my country, the Sudan, is also a \r\nvictim, like Cuba, of a unilateral blockade imposed by \r\nthe United States of America that affects all walks of \r\nlife, as described by the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Cuba. It has especially affected the economic, social \r\nand development sectors of the Sudan, just as Cuba has \r\nbeen deprived of its ability to import spare parts for vital \r\nsectors of the economy that are needed for development, \r\nsuch as communication, railways and civil aviation, as \r\nwell as the sugar industry and medication.\r\nI am not exaggerating when I say that the \r\nembargo has fuelled conflict in my country, because \r\nall the areas that are conflict-ridden are plagued by \r\nunderdevelopment. The failure to achieve development, \r\nwhich is the result of a lack of resources, can also be \r\nattributed to the lack of spare parts for sugar factories \r\nand other vital sectors of our economy.\r\n13-53630 7/8\r\n29/10/2013 A/68/PV.39\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. Godard knows he is lying when he asserts that the \r\nUnited States Government promotes respect for human \r\nrights in Cuba (see A/68/PV.38). The embargo is a \r\nmassive, f lagrant and systematic violation of the human \r\nrights of the Cuban people and is an act of genocide, \r\naccording to article 2, subparagraphs (b) and (c) of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide. The United States Government has \r\nno moral authority whatsoever to present itself as an \r\naccuser in that regard. It is responsible for wars that have \r\nkilled millions of civilians. It carries out extrajudicial \r\nexecutions with drones and deadly technologies. It \r\napplies the death penalty in a racially and socially \r\ndiscriminatory manner, and it commits horrendous \r\nlegal errors. It also kidnaps people and isolates them \r\nfrom justice in arbitrary detention. It cruelly uses \r\ntorture and forced feeding in the case of hunger strikes. \r\nThe Government of the United States \r\nmanipulates the issue of human rights as it sees fit. \r\nIts double standards destroyed the old and discredited \r\nCommission on Human Rights, which imploded when \r\nthe United States prevented a resolution whose sole \r\nintent was to investigate human rights violations at the \r\nGuantánamo naval base, which have been committed \r\nand are committed against foreign prisoners. With the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council hope was \r\nrenewed, but the United States very quickly boycotted \r\nit. Today American delegations are again generating \r\npressure, promoting resolutions to support their \r\nown narrow self-interests and that lack objectivity, \r\nimpartiality and universality. \r\nMr. Godard also lies when he says that the United \r\nStates provides medical supplies and equipment to \r\nCuba. I ask him if he could give some examples of that, \r\nand I invite him to keep doing so. Why then does the \r\nUnited States not lift the embargo on medicines and \r\nmedical equipment? If what Mr. Godard claims were \r\ntrue, then why is the United States is impeding the free \r\nf low of information and Cubans’ access to the Internet \r\nby preventing Cuba’s connection to nearby submarine \r\ncables? \r\nIt is not true that the United States Government \r\nsupports the Cuban people’s desire to freely decide their \r\nown destiny. That country usurped the independence \r\nthat the Cuban people won against Spanish colonialism, \r\nimposed the Platt Amendment, intervened militarily, \r\noccupied parts of our territory like the Guantánamo \r\nnaval base and supported bloody dictatorships. In \r\nMr. Vidal (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): As \r\nin previous years, Uruguay voted in favour of the \r\nresolution on this item (resolution 68/8), introduced by \r\nthe delegation of Cuba, as we believe that the embargo \r\nagainst that country is contrary to the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ncontravenes the rules of international law, in particular \r\nthe rules governing international trade and those of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization.\r\nUruguay’s position fits into the broader context of \r\nthe defence of multilateralism, non-intervention and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, which are fundamental \r\nprinciples of our diplomacy. That situation also affects \r\nanother fundamental principle — the legal equality of \r\nStates. It is precisely out of respect for that principle \r\nthat our country rejects any unilateral or extraterritorial \r\ncoercive measure that violates the rules of international \r\nlaw and the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The clearest contemporary example is the \r\nembargo unfairly imposed against the Republic of Cuba. \r\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay has expressed on \r\nmany occasions and repeats again today its opposition \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nagainst Cuba, which severely affects the well-being of \r\nthe Cuban people. \r\nAs a matter of principle, Uruguay rejects and \r\ndoes not recognize the extraterritorial application of \r\ndomestic laws of other States in its national legislation. \r\nIn that regard, we condemn the application of unilateral \r\ncoercive measures by the United States against Cuba, \r\nas they represent a form of pressure and an obstacle \r\nto dialogue and the necessary rapprochement between \r\nthe parties, which we hope will be resumed. By \r\nvoting in favour of the resolution, Uruguay reiterates \r\nits commitment to multilateralism as a legitimate \r\ninstrument for resolving disputes between States and \r\nfor promoting effective international cooperation, \r\nhuman rights, security and understanding between \r\npeoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote.\r\nThe representative of Cuba has asked to take the \r\nf loor in exercise of the right of reply. I remind him \r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and \r\nto 5 minutes for the second, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\n8/8 13-53630\r\nA/68/PV.39 29/10/2013\r\nof more than $196 million to produce supposed \r\ndissidents. Mr. Alan Gross, who was punished under \r\ndue process and who was cared for with the greatest \r\nconsideration for humanitarian concerns, is a United \r\nStates contractor who charged large sums of money to \r\nundertake subversive activities, using non-commercial \r\ntechnology, against the constitutional order of Cuba. \r\nThose acts are also provided for and sanctioned in \r\nthe United States. The United States Government is \r\nresponsible for the situation of Mr. Gross and should \r\nbegin by sitting down and talking seriously if it wishes \r\nto find a solution to his case. \r\nThe entire world better understands the United \r\nStates use of new technologies and its networks to \r\nimpose its military and economic hegemony following \r\nthe revelations confirming the existence of a United \r\nStates system of global espionage, including against its \r\nown citizens and those of other countries, including the \r\nforeign diplomats of its closest allies. The United States \r\nis constantly riding roughshod over international law \r\nand the basic principles and purposes of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which Mr. Godard says it promotes.\r\nThe updating of the economic model, Mr. Godard, \r\nis an issue of the sovereignty of the Cuban people. We \r\nare not in the least bit interested in his opinion, nor in \r\nthe opinion of the United States Government.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 41?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4 p.m.\r\ntaking our freedom, the United States established an \r\neconomic, political and media blockade, launched an \r\ninvasion of Playa Girón, exercised State terrorism and \r\nadopted legislation, including the Helms-Burton Act, \r\nthat authorizes full intervention in Cuba. It supports a \r\npolicy of destabilization and regime change. \r\nThe United States delegation is lying when it says \r\nthat its Government provides humanitarian assistance. \r\nIn so doing, it cynically counts the multimillion-dollar \r\nfunds earmarked by the United States Agency for \r\nInternational Development for subversion in our \r\ncountry, the hard-earned remittances and packages  sent \r\nby Cuban emigrants to their families and the modest \r\ndonations sent by non-governmental organizations \r\nafter having overcome numerous obstacles. \r\nWhy does the United States Government not \r\nrespect the constitutional right and the freedom of \r\nUnited States citizens to travel to Cuba as they travel \r\nto any other country, including in times of war? Why \r\ndoes it not lift the embargo on the telecommunications \r\nsector? Why does it not allow Cuba to be connected to \r\nsubmarine cables to access the Internet? Why does it not \r\neliminate its illegal and subversive radio and television \r\nbroadcasts? It would be better if it allowed the purchase \r\nof American software and the training of specialists, \r\neliminated the restrictions on information, and allowed \r\nthe use of services that provide technological support, \r\nwhich are currently prohibited in Cuba. Why does it not \r\nallow cooperation and exchange programmes between \r\nuniversities and provide scholarships in various areas \r\nof science and technology? \r\nThe United States pays mercenaries and agents \r\nin Cuba. It maintains a quadrennial public budget \r\n"
