"The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 115\r\nElections to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs and \r\nother elections\r\n(a) Election of seven members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/68/302)\r\nThe President: Pursuant to General Assembly \r\ndecision 42/450, of 17 December 1987, and upon \r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nAssembly elects the members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination.\r\nThe Assembly has before it document A/68/302, \r\nwhich contains the nominations by the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to fill the vacancies in the Committee \r\nthat will occur as a result of the expiration on \r\n31 December 2013 of the terms of office of Algeria, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Benin, China, Eritrea, Japan \r\nand the Republic of Korea. Those States are eligible for \r\nimmediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1 January \r\n2014, the following States will remain members of the \r\nCommittee: Argentina, Botswana, Belarus, Brazil, \r\nBulgaria, Cameroon, Cuba, El Salvador, France, \r\nGuinea, Guinea-Bissau, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, Italy, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Peru, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, the United States of \r\nAmerica, Uruguay and Zimbabwe. Those 24 States are \r\ntherefore not eligible in this election.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the \r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Benin and Ethiopia for two of the \r\nthree seats among the African States; China and Japan \r\nfor two of the three seats among the Asia-Pacific States; \r\nand Haiti for the one seat among the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States;\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot and there \r\nshall be no nominations. However, I should like to \r\nrecall paragraph 16 of General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing with the \r\nsecret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when \r\nthe number of candidates corresponds to the number \r\nof seats to be filled should become standard, unless \r\na delegation specifically requests a vote on a given \r\nelection. Today is not that day.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The number of States nominated \r\nfrom among the African States, the Asia-Pacific States \r\nand the Latin American and Caribbean States is equal \r\nto or less than the number of seats to be filled in each \r\nof those groups.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto declare those States nominated by the Economic \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.40\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n40th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 30 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Corrections should be submitted to the original \r\nlanguages only. They should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature \r\nof a member of the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room \r\nU-506. Corrections will be issued after the end of the session in a consolidated corrigendum.\r\n*1353755*\r\n13-53755 (E)\r\n2/4 13-53755\r\nA/68/PV.40 30/10/2013\r\nEthiopia, France, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, \r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, Libya, Mauritius, Nepal, \r\nthe Netherlands, Nigeria, San Marino, South Africa, \r\nSpain, the Sudan, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and \r\nthe United States of America. The names of those \r\n36 States should therefore not appear on the ballots.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI), of 20 December \r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that \r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January \r\n2014, the 18 members should be elected as follows: four \r\nfrom African States, four from Asia-Pacific States, \r\nthree from Eastern European States, three from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and four from the \r\nWestern European and other States. The ballot papers \r\nreflect that pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates — their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds majority \r\nand the greatest number of votes by members present \r\nand voting, will be declared elected. Consistent with \r\npast practice, in the case of a tie vote making it necessary \r\nto determine the candidate to be elected or that will \r\nproceed to the next round of restricted balloting, there \r\nwill be a special restricted ballot limited to those \r\ncandidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures of the respective regional \r\ngroups, the Secretariat has been informed of the \r\nfollowing. For the four vacant seats from among the \r\nAfrican States, the Group has endorsed four candidates: \r\nBotswana, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and Togo. For the four vacant \r\nseats from among the Asia-Pacific States, the Group \r\nhas endorsed four candidates: Bangladesh, China, \r\nKazakhstan and the Republic of Korea. For the three \r\nvacant seats from among the Eastern European States, \r\nthe Group has endorsed three candidates: Georgia, the \r\nRussian Federation and Serbia. For the three vacant \r\nseats from among the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, the Group has endorsed three candidates: \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Guatemala and Panama. For the \r\nand Social Council — Benin, China, Ethiopia, Haiti \r\nand Japan — elected members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination for a three-year term of \r\noffice beginning on 1 January 2014?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that \r\nhave just been elected members of the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination.\r\nMembers are reminded that the Economic and \r\nSocial Council postponed the nomination of one \r\nmember from the African States and one member from \r\nthe Asia-Pacific States for election for a three-year \r\nterm beginning on 1 January 2014. Members are also \r\nreminded that there remain two vacancies from among \r\nthe Western European and other States for terms \r\nbeginning on the date of election and expiring on \r\n31 December 2014, and one vacancy, also from among \r\nthe Western European and other States, for a term \r\nbeginning on the date of appointment and expiring on \r\n31 December 2015. The General Assembly will be in a \r\nposition to act on those vacancies upon nomination by \r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 115.\r\nAgenda item 114 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now \r\nproceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council to replace those members whose \r\nterm of office expires on 31 December 2013.\r\nThe 18 outgoing members are: Bulgaria, Cameroon, \r\nChina, Denmark, Ecuador, Gabon, Latvia, Malawi, \r\nMexico, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Qatar, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Senegal, \r\nSweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland.

In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s name plate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of \r\nthe States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be \r\ndeclared invalid if it contains more names of Member \r\nStates from the relevant region than the number of seats \r\nassigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if \r\nnone of the names of the Member States on that ballot \r\nbelongs to the relevant region. If a ballot paper of a \r\nregion contains both the names of Member States that \r\nbelong to and that are outside that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid but only the names of the Member States \r\nthat belong to the relevant region will be counted. The \r\nnames of Member States that do not belong to that \r\nregion will not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Canadas \r\nBorjas (Andorra), Mr. Israfilov (Azerbaijan), \r\nMs. Kamis (Brunei Darussalam), Ms. Tambunan \r\n(Indonesia), Ms. Karamane (Latvia), Mrs. Reetoo \r\n(Mauritius), Ms. Roopnarine (Trinidad and Tobago) \r\nand Mr. Silwamba (Zambia) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.35 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 188\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members present and voting: 187\r\n4/4 13-53755\r\nA/68/PV.40 30/10/2013\r\nChina, the Congo, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, Denmark, Georgia, Guatemala, \r\nKazakhstan, New Zealand, Panama, the Republic \r\nof Korea, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Sweden, \r\nTogo and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have \r\nbeen elected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nBefore concluding, I should like to announce that \r\nthe by-election to fill the vacancies resulting from four \r\nmembers from the Group of Western European and \r\nother States relinquishing their seats will be held on \r\nMonday, 18 November 2013.\r\nThis concludes this stage of our consideration of \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 114.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.45 a.m.\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumber of members present and voting: 184\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 123\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nNew Zealand 179\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nNorthern Ireland 178\r\nSweden 176\r\nDenmark 175\r\nGreece 6\r\nItaly 2\r\nPortugal 1\r\nGermany 1\r\nSwitzerland 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nof members present and voting and the largest \r\nnumber of votes, the following 18 States were elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council for \r\na three-year term beginning on 1 January 2014: \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Bangladesh, Botswana, \r\n"
