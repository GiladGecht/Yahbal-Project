"In the absence of the President, Ms. Picco (Monaco), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 72\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of  \r\nJustice (A/68/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/349)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): It \r\nis my great honour to welcome to United Nations \r\nHeadquarters His Excellency Peter Tomka, President \r\nof the International Court of Justice, and to invite him \r\nto take the f loor.\r\nMr. Tomka, President of the International Court of \r\nJustice (spoke in French): It is a great pleasure for me to \r\nintroduce the report on the activities of the International \r\nCourt of the Justice (A/68/4) to the General Assembly \r\ntoday. The President of the Assembly at the current \r\nsession demonstrated his competent leadership two years \r\nago, when he so brilliantly chaired the Assembly’s Legal \r\nCommittee (Sixth Committee).\r\n(spoke in English):\r\nI would like to thank the General Assembly for \r\ncontinuing the practice of allowing the President of \r\nthe Court to present a review of its judicial activities \r\nover the previous judicial year. This practice reflects \r\nthe interest in and support for the Court shown by the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nDuring the past 12 months, the Court has continued \r\nto fulfil its role as the forum of choice of the international \r\ncommunity of States for the peaceful settlement of \r\nevery kind of international dispute over which it has \r\njurisdiction. As illustrated in the report that I have the \r\nhonour to introduce to the Assembly today, the Court \r\nhas made every effort to meet the expectations of the \r\nparties appearing before it in a timely manner. It should \r\nbe emphasized once again in that regard that, since the \r\nCourt has been able to clear its backlog of cases, States \r\nthinking of submitting cases to the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations can be confident that as \r\nsoon as they have completed their written exchanges, \r\nthe Court will move to the hearings stage without delay.\r\nDuring the period under review, as many as \r\n11 contentious cases were pending before the Court, \r\nwhich held public hearings in the following three in \r\nturn: the case concerning Maritime Dispute (Peru v. \r\nChile), the request for interpretation of the Judgment \r\nof 15 June 1962 in the case concerning Temple of \r\nPreah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand), and the case \r\nconcerning Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. \r\nJapan: New Zealand intervening). The Court is now \r\ndeliberating in two of those cases. In the third, having \r\ncompleted its work, the Court will deliver its judgment \r\nin early November. During the reporting period, \r\nthe Court also delivered two judgments — the first \r\nin Territorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. \r\nColombia) and the second in Frontier Dispute (Burkina \r\nFaso/Niger) — and six orders.\r\nAs is traditional, I shall now report briefly on \r\nthe main decisions of the Court from the past year. \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.41\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n41st plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 31 October 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Also taking into \r\naccount the practice of third States and the existing \r\nmaps — while emphasizing that the latter are not \r\nevidence of sovereignty — the Court concluded that \r\nColombia, and not Nicaragua, has sovereignty over \r\nthose features.\r\nWith that issue resolved, the Court addressed \r\nNicaragua’s request asking it to delimit a continental \r\nshelf beyond 200 nautical miles. After finding that \r\nrequest to be admissible, the Court examined the \r\nmerits. In that regard, it recalled its statement in its \r\n2007 judgment in the case concerning the Territorial \r\nand Maritime Dispute between Nicaragua and \r\nHonduras in the Caribbean Sea, namely, that “any \r\nclaim of continental shelf rights beyond 200 miles” by \r\na State party to the 1982 Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea (UNCLOS) “must be in accordance with article 76 \r\nof UNCLOS and reviewed by the Commission on the \r\nLimits of the Continental Shelf”.\r\nThe Court made it clear that, given the object and \r\npurpose of the Convention on the Law of the Sea as \r\nstipulated in its Preamble, the fact that Colombia is not a \r\nparty thereto did not relieve Nicaragua of its obligations \r\nunder article 76 of that instrument. The Court noted \r\nthat Nicaragua had submitted to the Commission only \r\npreliminary information, which fell short of meeting \r\nthe requirements for the Commission to be able to make \r\na recommendation. As the Court was not presented \r\nwith any further information, it found that, in the case \r\nin question, Nicaragua had not established that it had a \r\ncontinental margin that extended far enough to overlap \r\nwith Colombia’s 200-nautical-mile entitlement to the \r\ncontinental shelf, measured from Colombia’s mainland \r\ncoast. The Court thus declared that it was not in a \r\nposition to delimit the boundary between the extended \r\ncontinental shelf claimed by Nicaragua and the \r\ncontinental shelf of Colombia, and therefore concluded \r\nthat Nicaragua’s claim could not be upheld.\r\nIn the light of that decision, the Court considered \r\nwhat maritime delimitation should be effected. It \r\nobserved that in its final submissions, Nicaragua had \r\nrequested that the Court not only delimit the continental \r\nshelf between the mainland coasts of the two parties, but \r\nalso adjudge and declare that the islands of San Andrés \r\nand Providencia and Santa Catalina should be enclaved \r\nand accorded a maritime entitlement of 12 nautical \r\nmiles, and that the equitable solution for any cay that \r\nmight be found on the Colombian side was to delimit \r\nI shall deal first with the judgment delivered in the \r\ncase concerning Territorial and Maritime Dispute \r\n(Nicaragua v. Colombia), before turning to the \r\njudgment rendered in the case concerning Frontier \r\nDispute (Burkina Faso/Niger) and then to certain orders \r\nissued in the cases concerning Whaling in the Antarctic \r\n(Australia v. Japan), Certain Activities carried out by \r\nNicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) \r\nand Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San \r\nJuan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica). Lastly, I shall \r\nrefer to an order made in the case concerning Aerial \r\nHerbicide Spraying (Ecuador v. Colombia).\r\nThe first judgment delivered by the Court during \r\nthe period under review was given on 19 November \r\n2012, in the case concerning Territorial and Maritime \r\nDispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia). The proceedings \r\nhad been instituted by Nicaragua against Colombia in \r\nrespect of a dispute concerning “a group of related legal \r\nissues subsisting” between the two States “concerning \r\ntitle to territory and maritime delimitation” in the \r\nwestern Caribbean. A first decision was adopted in the \r\ncase on 13 December 2007, since the Court had been \r\ncalled upon to rule on preliminary objections raised by \r\nColombia. At that time, the Court found that the issue of \r\nsovereignty over certain islands — namely, those of San \r\nAndrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina — had been \r\nsettled, within the meaning of article VI of the Pact of \r\nBogotá, by a treaty concluded between Nicaragua and \r\nColombia in 1928, and that therefore the Court had no \r\njurisdiction to rule on that point.\r\nHowever, it considered that it had jurisdiction to \r\nadjudicate the dispute concerning sovereignty over \r\nthe other maritime features claimed by the parties, \r\nas well as the dispute concerning the delimitation of \r\nthe maritime spaces appertaining to each of them in \r\nthe region. In particular, the Court considered that \r\nthe 82nd meridian, which under the 1930 Protocol of \r\nExchange of Ratifications of the 1928 Treaty “fixes the \r\nwestern limit of the San Andrés Archipelago”, did not \r\nmark the maritime boundary between the two States, as \r\noriginally claimed by Colombia.\r\nIn its judgment of 19 November 2012, the Court \r\nfirst dealt with the question of sovereignty over the \r\nmaritime features claimed by Nicaragua and Colombia. \r\nAfter considering not only the 1928 agreement between \r\nthe two parties and various historical documents, but \r\nalso the arguments put forward on the basis of uti \r\npossidetis juris and effectivités, the Court found that \r\nfor many decades Colombia had acted continuously \r\n13-53979 3/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nwhat adjustment to make to the provisional line or in \r\nwhat way that line should be shifted, the conduct of \r\nthe parties, issues of access to natural resources and \r\ndelimitations already effected in the area were not \r\nrelevant circumstances in the case.\r\nWith respect to the latter two points, the Court \r\nfirst recalled that although both parties had raised the \r\nquestion of equitable access to natural resources, neither \r\nhad offered evidence of particular circumstances that \r\nshould be treated as relevant. It considered that the case \r\ndid not present issues of access to natural resources \r\nso exceptional as to warrant the Court’s treating them \r\nas a relevant consideration. In regard to delimitations \r\nalready effected in the area, the Court then indicated \r\nthat the agreements concluded by Colombia with some \r\nother States in the region were without legal effect \r\nwith regard to Nicaragua, in accordance with the well-\r\nestablished principle of res inter alios acta. In the light \r\nof all those findings, the Court proceeded to shift the \r\nprovisional median line.\r\nIn the third stage, the Court ascertains whether \r\nthe effect of the line, once it has been shifted, is that \r\nthe maritime areas attributed to each of the parties in \r\nthe relevant zone — that is to say, the portion of the \r\nmaritime area in which the parties’ claims overlap — are \r\nmarkedly disproportionate to their respective relevant \r\ncoasts. In the case in question, the Court noted that the \r\nboundary line had the effect of dividing the relevant \r\nzone between the parties in a ratio of approximately \r\n1:3.44 in Nicaragua’s favour. As indicated previously, \r\nsince the ratio between the relevant coasts was \r\napproximately 1:8.2, the question arose as to whether, \r\ngiven the circumstances of the case, that disproportion \r\nwas so great as to render the result inequitable.\r\nThe Court concluded that, taking account of all \r\nthe circumstances of the case, the result achieved \r\nby the maritime delimitation did not entail such \r\ndisproportionality as to create an inequitable result. \r\nAccordingly, it unanimously fixed the definitive course \r\nof the boundary between Nicaragua and Colombia, \r\na decision that included the judges ad hoc chosen by \r\nNicaragua and Colombia, respectively. I regret that it was \r\nnot possible to display here some of the maps depicting \r\nthose boundaries, as that would have facilitated better \r\nunderstanding of the Court’s judgment and visualizing \r\nthe final result.\r\nFinally, the Court considered that Nicaragua’s \r\nrequest, asking it to adjudge and declare that\r\na maritime boundary by drawing a three-nautical-mile \r\nenclave around it. The Court also noted that Colombia, \r\nfor its part, had requested that the delimitation should \r\nbe effected by a single maritime boundary, constructed \r\nas a median line between Nicaraguan fringing islands \r\nand the islands of the San Andrés Archipelago.\r\nThe Court concluded that notwithstanding its \r\naforementioned decision regarding Nicaragua’s \r\nrequest that it delimit an extended continental shelf, \r\nit was still called on to effect a delimitation between \r\nthe overlapping maritime entitlements of Colombia, \r\nbased on its sovereignty over the islands forming the \r\nSan Andrés Archipelago, and Nicaragua, within 200 \r\nnautical miles of the Nicaraguan coast. To that end, it \r\napplied its standard methodology, a method that it set \r\nout clearly in its seminal 2009 judgment in the case \r\nconcerning Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea \r\n(Romania v. Ukraine), a methodology that consists of \r\nthree stages.\r\nThe Court first determines base points and \r\nconstructs a provisional median line between the \r\nrelevant coasts of the parties, namely, those coasts \r\nwhose projections overlap. In the case at hand, the \r\nCourt found that for Nicaragua the relevant coast was \r\nits whole coast projecting into the area where the claims \r\nof the two parties overlap. Since the mainland coast of \r\nColombia does not generate any entitlement in that \r\narea, the Court considered that it could not be regarded \r\nas part of the relevant coast for the purposes of the case. \r\nThe Court found that the relevant Colombian coast was \r\nconfined to the coasts of the islands under Colombian \r\nsovereignty. Since the area of the overlapping claims of \r\nthe parties extended well to the east of the Colombian \r\nislands, the Court considered that it was the entire \r\ncoastline of those islands, not merely the west-facing \r\ncoasts, that had to be taken into account.\r\nIn the second stage, the Court considers whether \r\nthere are any relevant circumstances that may call for \r\nan adjustment or shift of the provisional line so as to \r\nachieve an equitable result. In the present case, the Court \r\nnoted that the substantial disparity between the relevant \r\ncoast of the Colombian islands and that of Nicaragua, \r\na ratio of approximately 1 to 8.2 — that is, the coast of \r\nNicaragua being more than eight times longer than that \r\nof Colombia — as well as the need to avoid cutting off \r\neither party from the maritime spaces into which its \r\ncoasts project, were both relevant circumstances. The \r\nCourt further observed that while legitimate security \r\nconsiderations had to be borne in mind in determining \r\n4/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nCourt to include their course in the operative part of \r\nits judgment, so that the parties would be bound in that \r\nrespect in the same way that they would be bound with \r\nregard to the frontier line in the central sector.\r\nThe Court first recalled that, when it is seized on the \r\nbasis of a special agreement, any request made by a party \r\nin its final submissions can fall within the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court only if it remains within the limits defined \r\nby the provisions of that special agreement. In this \r\ncase, however, the Court considered that the request \r\nmade by Burkina Faso did not correspond to the terms \r\nof the special agreement, since Burkina Faso was not \r\nrequesting it to place on record the parties’ agreement \r\nregarding the delimitation of the frontier in the two \r\ndemarcated sectors, but rather to delimit itself the \r\nfrontier according to a line that corresponded to the \r\nconclusions of the Joint Technical Commission.\r\nThe Court pointed out that, while it has the power \r\nto interpret the final submissions of the parties in \r\nsuch a way as to maintain them within the limits of its \r\njurisdiction, that is not sufficient for it to entertain such \r\na request; it would still have to be verified that the object \r\nof that request falls within the Court’s judicial function, \r\nwhich is to decide in accordance with international law \r\nsuch disputes as are submitted to it. In this case, neither \r\nof the parties had ever claimed that a dispute existed \r\nbetween them concerning the delimitation of the \r\nfrontier in the two sectors in question on the date when \r\nthe proceedings were instituted, nor, indeed, that such \r\na dispute had subsequently arisen. Accordingly, the \r\nCourt considered that Burkina Faso’s request exceeded \r\nthe limits of its judicial function.\r\nThat being established, the Court addressed the \r\nquestion of the course of the section of the frontier \r\nremaining in dispute. To that end, it first determined \r\nthe applicable law.\r\nAfter recalling that article 6 of the special \r\nagreement highlighted the principle of the intangibility \r\nof boundaries inherited from colonization and the \r\nAgreement between the two States of 28 March 1987, the \r\nCourt noted that the latter instrument specified the acts \r\nand documents of the French colonial administration \r\nthat must be used to determine the delimitation line that \r\nexisted when the two countries gained independence.\r\nThose acts and documents were the Arrêté of 31 August \r\n1927 adopted by the Governor-General ad interim of \r\nFrench West Africa with a view to fixing the boundaries \r\nof the colonies of Upper Volta and Niger, as clarified \r\nby its Erratum of 5 October 1927. The Court further \r\n“Colombia [wa]s not acting in accordance with her \r\nobligations under international law by stopping \r\nand otherwise hindering [it] from accessing and \r\ndisposing of her natural resources to the east of the \r\n82nd meridian”\r\nwas unfounded in the context of the proceedings \r\nregarding a maritime boundary that had not been settled \r\nprior to the decision of the Court.\r\nIt should be stressed that, in accordance with Article \r\n59 of the Statute of the Court, the Court’s judgment in \r\nthe case has no binding force except between the parties \r\nand in respect of that particular case. This judgment \r\naddresses only Nicaragua’s rights as against Colombia \r\nand vice versa; it is without prejudice to any claim by \r\na third State or any claim that either party may have \r\nagainst a third State. Moreover, as it expressly recalled \r\nin this decision and in the judgments rendered on 4 May \r\n2011 in respect of the applications by Costa Rica and \r\nHonduras for permission to intervene, the Court always \r\ntakes care not to draw a boundary line that extends into \r\nareas where the rights of third States may be affected.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court delivered \r\na second judgment, on 16 April 2013, in the case \r\nconcerning the Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger). \r\nThe proceedings had been instituted in July 2010 by a \r\nspecial agreement under which the two parties agreed \r\nto submit to the Court the frontier dispute between \r\nthem concerning a section of their common boundary.\r\nThe frontier between Burkina Faso and Niger \r\nconsists of three main sectors. The northern sector, \r\nwhich runs from the heights of N’Gouma to the \r\nastronomic marker of Tong-Tong, and the southern \r\nsector, which runs from the beginning of the Botou \r\nbend to the River Mekrou, had been demarcated by a \r\njoint commission before the case was brought. There \r\nremained to be delimited only the central sector, \r\nrunning from the Tong-Tong astronomic marker to \r\nthe beginning of the Botou bend. However, under the \r\nspecial agreement, the Court was asked not only to \r\ndetermine the course of the frontier between Burkina \r\nFaso and Niger in the central sector, but also to place on \r\nrecord the parties’ agreement on the results of the work \r\nof the Joint Technical Commission on Demarcation.\r\nIn its judgment, the Court examined, as a \r\npreliminary issue, a request by Burkina Faso regarding \r\nthe two sectors of the frontier that were already \r\ndemarcated. In particular, Burkina Faso asked the \r\n13-53979 5/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nin article 82 of the Rules of Court, the Court concluded \r\nthat New Zealand’s declaration of intervention was \r\nadmissible.\r\nAccordingly, the Court authorized New Zealand \r\nto submit written and oral observations on the subject-\r\nmatter of its intervention, and the Parties to comment \r\non those observations. New Zealand participated in the \r\nhearings on the merits held in the case by the Court \r\nbetween 26 June and 16 July 2013.\r\nSubsequently, the Court handed down four orders \r\nin two cases between Costa Rica and Nicaragua, \r\nnamely the case concerning Certain Activities carried \r\nout by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. \r\nNicaragua) and the case concerning Construction \r\nof a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River \r\n(Nicaragua v. Costa Rica).\r\nFirst of all, the Court, in conformity with the \r\nprinciple of the sound administration of justice and with \r\nthe need for judicial economy, considered it appropriate \r\nto join the proceedings in the two cases by two separate \r\norders dated 17 April 2013.\r\nThe Court then handed down an order on 18 April \r\n2013 regarding four counter-claims submitted by \r\nNicaragua in its counter-memorial filed in the case \r\nconcerning Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua \r\nin the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua). The Court \r\nfirst found, unanimously, that there was no need for it \r\nto adjudicate on the admissibility of Nicaragua’s first \r\ncounter-claim, since that claim had become without \r\nobject by reason of the fact that the proceedings in the \r\nCosta Rica v. Nicaragua and Nicaragua v. Costa Rica \r\ncases had been joined by the aforementioned order.\r\nThe Court further found, unanimously, that the \r\nsecond and third counter-claims, which concerned, \r\nrespectively, the status of the Bay of San Juan del \r\nNorte and the right to free navigation on the Colorado \r\nRiver, were inadmissible as such and did not form part \r\nof the current proceedings, since there was no direct \r\nconnection, either in fact or in law, between those \r\nclaims and the principal claims of Costa Rica. The \r\nCourt lastly found, unanimously, that there was no \r\nneed for it to entertain the fourth counter-claim, which \r\nrelated to alleged breaches of the order indicating \r\nprovisional measures made by the Court on 8 March \r\n2011. It specified that the question of compliance by \r\nboth parties with the provisional measures indicated \r\nin the case might be considered by the Court in the \r\nprincipal proceedings, irrespective of whether or not \r\nobserved that the 1987 Agreement provided for the \r\npossibility of the Arrêté and Erratum not sufficing and \r\nestablished that, in that event, the course should be \r\nthat shown on the 1:200,000-scale map of the Institut \r\ngéographique national de France, 1960 edition. It was \r\ntherefore in the light of those elements that the Court \r\ndetermined the course of the frontier between the Tong-\r\nTong astronomic marker and the beginning of the Botou \r\nbend. I should like to point out that that judgment was \r\nadopted unanimously, including by the ad hoc judges \r\nchosen by Burkina Faso and Niger, respectively.\r\nOnce that course had been established, the Court \r\nwas lastly required to rule on one final request of the \r\nparties, which had asked it to nominate three neutral \r\nexperts to assist them in the demarcation of their \r\nfrontier in the area in dispute. The Court did so by \r\nmeans of an order dated 12 July 2013.\r\nAs I have already mentioned, during the period \r\nunder review the Court also handed down five other \r\norders. I shall now refer to them briefly in chronological \r\norder.\r\nThe first order was handed down on 6 February \r\n2013 in the case concerning Whaling in the Antarctic \r\n(Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening). That \r\norder followed a declaration whereby New Zealand \r\navailed itself of the right conferred on it by Article 63, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute to intervene as a non-party \r\nin the proceedings before the Court. According \r\nto that provision, whenever the interpretation of a \r\nconvention is in question, States that are not parties \r\nto the proceedings but are parties to that convention \r\nmay intervene for the sole purpose of addressing to the \r\nCourt their observations on the interpretation of the said \r\nconvention. The interpretation given by the Court is \r\nthen binding upon them. New Zealand’s declaration of \r\nintervention was directed to questions of interpretation \r\narising in the case, relating in particular to article VIII, \r\nparagraph 1, of the International Convention for the \r\nRegulation of Whaling, which lies at the heart of the \r\ndispute between Australia and Japan.\r\nIn its decision, the Court pointed out that the fact \r\nthat intervention under Article 63 of the Statute is \r\nbased on a right is not sufficient for the submission of \r\na “declaration” to that end to confer ipso facto on the \r\ndeclarant State the status of intervener, and that such \r\nright to intervene exists only when the declaration \r\nconcerned falls within the provisions of Article 63 of the \r\nStatute. After considering whether it fell within those \r\nprovisions and whether it met the requirements set out \r\n6/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nThe agreement sets out operational parameters for \r\nColombia’s spraying programme, records the agreement \r\nof the two Governments to carry out ongoing exchanges \r\nof information in that regard, and establishes a dispute \r\nsettlement mechanism. The agreement also stipulates \r\nthat Colombia will provide a financial contribution to \r\nEcuador for the economic and social development of \r\nits provinces located near the northern border. I would \r\nadd that both parties expressed their gratitude to the \r\nCourt for its efforts and praised the role it had played in \r\nenabling them to achieve a settlement.\r\nHaving thus recalled the principal decisions \r\nrendered by the International Court of Justice during \r\nthe past year, I shall now turn to two new cases that \r\nhave been submitted to it.\r\nThe first case was brought before it on 24 April 2013 \r\nby the Plurinational State of Bolivia, which instituted \r\nproceedings against the Republic of Chile concerning a \r\ndispute in relation to Chile’s obligation to negotiate in \r\ngood faith and effectively with Bolivia in order to reach \r\nan agreement granting Bolivia a fully sovereign access \r\nto the Pacific Ocean.\r\nThe second case was brought on 16 September \r\n2013. Nicaragua informed the Court of a dispute with \r\nColombia concerning the delimitation of the boundaries \r\nbetween, on the one hand, the continental shelf of \r\nNicaragua beyond the 200-nautical-mile limit from the \r\nbaselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea \r\nof Nicaragua is measured, and on the other hand, the \r\ncontinental shelf of Colombia.\r\nThere are, therefore, currently 10 cases on the \r\nCourt’s General List. On 11 November 2013, the Court \r\nwill deliver its judgment in the case concerning the \r\nRequest for Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June \r\n1962 in the Case concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand) (Cambodia v. Thailand).\r\nFinally, I would like to point out that the Court held \r\npublic hearings in mid-October on a new request for \r\nthe indication of provisional measures submitted by \r\nCosta Rica in the case concerning Certain Activities \r\ncarried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa \r\nRica v. Nicaragua). As this is an urgent procedure, the \r\nCourt will hand down its order on this request as soon \r\nas possible. The Court has also decided to hold hearings \r\nsome time next week on the request for the indication \r\nof provisional measures submitted by Nicaragua in the \r\ncase concerning the Construction of a road in Costa \r\nRica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica).\r\nthe respondent State raised that issue by way of a \r\ncounter-claim.\r\nIn the same cases, which are now joined, the \r\nCourt was lastly called upon to rule on two requests, \r\nsubmitted respectively by Costa Rica in late May 2013, \r\nand Nicaragua in mid-June 2013, for the modification \r\nof the order of 8 March 2011 indicating provisional \r\nmeasures in the case concerning Certain Activities \r\ncarried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa \r\nRica v. Nicaragua). \r\nBy an order dated 16 July 2013, the Court stated that \r\nthe same general conditions governed the modification \r\nand indication of provisional measures, and that the \r\ncircumstances, as they then presented themselves to \r\nthe Court, were not such as to require the exercise of \r\nits power to modify the measures indicated in its order \r\nof 8 March 2011. The Court nevertheless reaffirmed \r\nthose measures, and in particular the requirement \r\nthat the parties should “refrain from any action which \r\nmight aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court \r\nor make it more difficult to resolve”, noting that the \r\nactions thus referred to could consist of either acts or \r\nomissions.\r\nI would also like to mention that, by an order which \r\nI made on 13 September 2013, the case concerning \r\nAerial Herbicide Spraying (Ecuador v. Colombia) was \r\nremoved from the Court’s list at the request of Ecuador. \r\nThe hearings in that case had been scheduled to take \r\nplace between 30 September and 18 October of this year. \r\nBy a letter dated 12 September 2013, Ecuador, referring \r\nto article 89 of the Rules of Court and to an agreement \r\nbetween the parties dated 9 September 2013, notified \r\nthe Court that it wished to discontinue the proceedings \r\nin the case. By a letter of the same day, Colombia then \r\ninformed the Court, pursuant to article 89, paragraph 2, \r\nof the Rules of Court, that it made no objection to that \r\ndiscontinuance.\r\nThe agreement in question fully and finally \r\nresolves all of Ecuador’s claims against Colombia in the \r\ndispute concerning Colombia’s aerial spraying of toxic \r\nherbicides at locations near its border with Ecuador, \r\nin order to eradicate coca plantations. It establishes, \r\namong other things, an exclusion zone in which \r\nColombia will not conduct aerial spraying operations; \r\ncreates a Joint Commission to ensure that spraying \r\noperations outside that zone have not caused herbicides \r\nto drift into Ecuador; and, so long as they have not, \r\nprovides a mechanism for the gradual reduction in the \r\nwidth of the said zone.\r\n13-53979 7/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nInternational Court of Justice” and takes note of the \r\nreport contained in document A/68/4, regarding the \r\nactivities of the Court between 1 August 2012 to 31 July \r\n2013, as requested by the decision of the Assembly last \r\nyear. I would also like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for introducing the report \r\nto the Assembly.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms and \r\nunderscores its principled positions concerning the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use, or \r\nthreat of use, of force. The International Court of \r\nJustice has a significant role to play in promoting and \r\nencouraging the settlement of international disputes \r\nby peaceful means, as reflected in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, and in such a manner that international \r\npeace and security, and justice are not endangered.\r\nThe Movement endeavours to generate further \r\nprogress towards achieving full respect for international \r\nlaw and, in that regard, commends the role of the Court \r\nin promoting the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes, in accordance with the relevant provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the Statute of the \r\nCourt, in particular, Articles 33 and 94 of the Charter.\r\nIn regard to the advisory opinions of the Court, \r\nnoting the fact that the Security Council has not sought \r\nany advisory opinion from the Court since 1970, NAM \r\nurges the Security Council to make greater use of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, as a source of advisory \r\nopinions and the interpretation of relevant norms of \r\ninternational law, and on controversial issues. It further \r\nrequests the Council to use the Court as a source for \r\ninterpreting relevant international law and also urges \r\nthe Council to consider having its decisions be reviewed \r\nby the Court, bearing in mind the need to ensure their \r\nadherence to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Movement also invites the General Assembly, \r\nother organs of the United Nations and the duly \r\nauthorized specialized agencies to request advisory \r\nopinions of the International Court of Justice on legal \r\nquestions arising within the scope of their activities.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms the \r\nimportance of the unanimous advisory opinion issued \r\nby the International Court of Justice on 8 July 1996 on \r\nthe Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. In \r\nthat opinion, the Court concluded that\r\nI should also like to mention that the Court \r\nis now working in the renovated and modernized \r\nGreat Hall of Justice, thanks, in large part, to the \r\ncontributions provided by the General Assembly and \r\nthe Carnegie Foundation. The renovation project, \r\nwhich coincided with the centenary of the Peace \r\nPalace, was unparalleled in the history of the Peace \r\nPalace. While minor refurbishment work had been \r\ndone in the past, such as extending the Bench in view \r\nof the enlarged composition of the Court’s predecessor, \r\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice, no major \r\nreconfiguration of this magnitude had been carried out \r\nin the Great Hall. The Court met for the first time in \r\nthe renovated Great Hall in April, and henceforth it will \r\nhave access to improved technical facilities offering a \r\nwide range of possibilities. Therefore, the Court will \r\nbe able to hear the cases submitted to it faithfully and \r\nimpartially — as it always does by virtue of its noble \r\njudicial mission — but it will do so in a more modern \r\nsetting.\r\nIn fact, the Great Hall of Justice was the venue \r\nfor speakers and guests on the occasion of a recent \r\nconference organized by the Court to celebrate the \r\ncentenary of the Peace Palace on 23 September. In that \r\ncontext, the Court hosted eminent guests and brought \r\ntogether panels of very distinguished speakers. That \r\nresulted in a conference programme that was as rich \r\nas it was balanced in engaging the past and present \r\nof international justice, while also contemplating the \r\nopportunities that will arise in the future, including at \r\nthe Court.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall that the Court \r\nmust do its utmost to serve the noble purposes and \r\ngoals of the United Nations using limited resources, \r\nsince the Member States award it less than 1 per cent of \r\nthe Organization’s regular budget. Nevertheless, I hope \r\nthat I have shown that the recent contributions of the \r\nCourt are not to be measured in terms of the financial \r\nresources that sustain it, but against the great progress \r\nmade in the advancement of international justice and \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes between States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I thank \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM).\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to agenda item 72, “Report of the \r\n8/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nmembers of the Court and the fiscal responsibilities of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe delegations of our three countries have \r\ntremendous respect both for the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and for the quality and dedication of the \r\njudges who sit on that important body. Our confidence \r\nin the Court and in its ability to render considered \r\njudgments on complex international legal issues is \r\nreflected in our acceptance of the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. We encourage other Members of the \r\nUnited Nations who have not yet done so to deposit \r\nwith the Secretary-General a declaration of acceptance \r\nof the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. There could be \r\nno more affirmative way of declaring confidence in the \r\nCourt and in the fair and impartial application of the \r\ninternational rule of law.\r\nMs. Orosan (Romania): Romania is a strong \r\nsupporter of the role played by the International \r\nCourt of Justice in the promotion of the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations and is grateful to the President of \r\nthe Court for the comprehensive report on the intensive \r\nactivity of the Court over the past year (A/68/4).\r\nThe role of the International Court of Justice in \r\npromoting the rule of law by applying the principles \r\nand norms of international law, thus contributing to \r\nfriendly relations among States and to international \r\npeace and security, is undisputed. The increasing \r\nnumber of cases on the docket of the Court and the \r\nreferral of disputes involving numerous conventions \r\nof universal application to the international court’s \r\njurisdiction stand as proof.\r\nThe influence of the Court in international relations \r\nis thus felt increasingly broadly. In our view, that is \r\na positive development indicating that the Court’s \r\njudgments are perceived as free of bias and as fully \r\nreflecting international law and contributing to its \r\ndevelopment.\r\nRomania has some experience in relation to \r\nproceedings before the Court, namely, the case \r\nconcerning Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea \r\n(Romania v. Ukraine), which was settled by the Court in \r\na judgment rendered unanimously on 3 February 2009, \r\nand the proceedings relating to the advisory opinion on \r\nthe question of the accordance with international law of \r\nthe unilateral declaration of independence in respect of \r\nKosovo. Our experience has been thoroughly positive, \r\nserving as a significant impetus in our decision to \r\n“there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith \r\nand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to \r\nnuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict \r\nand effective international control”.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement continues to call on \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, to fully respect the 9 July \r\n2004 advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice on the Legal Consequences of the Construction \r\nof a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and calls \r\nupon all States to ensure respect for the provisions \r\ntherein for the realization of the end of the Israeli \r\noccupation that began in 1967 and the independence of \r\nthe State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): Australia, Canada and \r\nNew Zealand thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Tomka, for introducing the \r\nreport on the work of the Court over the past year \r\n(A/68/4).\r\nUniversal adherence to the international rule of \r\nlaw is crucial for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nand the avoidance of conflict. As countries that are \r\nfirmly committed to the rule of law, Australia, Canada \r\nand New Zealand have always been, and will continue \r\nto be, strong supporters of the Court as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. The Court is \r\ncentral to ensuring that the rule of law is maintained \r\nand strengthened at the international level and, for that \r\nreason, deserves our continuing support. Australia, \r\nCanada and New Zealand therefore welcome the \r\nCourt’s efficient handling of the cases before it and the \r\nsteps it continues to take to improve its overall working \r\nmethods.\r\nWe are pleased that, during the 2012-2013 reporting \r\nperiod, the Court finalized a range of complex cases \r\naddressing a diversity of legal issues, subject matters \r\nand geographical regions — as evidenced by Judge \r\nTomka’s statement — thereby contributing greatly to \r\nthe development and clarification of international legal \r\nprinciples. The increased willingness of States to turn \r\nto judicial settlement for the resolution of their disputes \r\nis welcome and is testimony to the confidence of the \r\ninternational community in the work of the Court.\r\nWe have taken note of then-President Judge Owada’s \r\npaper (A/66/726, annex) setting out the Court’s response \r\nto the Secretary-General’s report on the comprehensive \r\nreview of the pension scheme of the members of the \r\nCourt. In our view, it is highly important to strike the \r\nright balance between the principles of equality of the \r\n13-53979 9/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nthe context of Romania’s overall foreign policy. The \r\npublic discussion evinced general support for the \r\ninitiative of accepting the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court, an approach shared by the Romanian \r\nauthorities, specialists in the fields of international law \r\nand the general public. We can therefore envisage that \r\nRomania will soon join the group of States that have \r\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nThe Court is the highest judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations and has an acknowledged body of \r\nthe most prominent professionals in the legal field. \r\nWe think the United Nations and its Member States \r\nmust do everything to assist the Court in fulfilling its \r\nnoble mandate, to maintain and consolidate its highest \r\nprofessional status and to improve the procedures of the \r\nCourt, while complying with its Statute.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, I thank Judge Peter Tomka, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for \r\nintroducing to the Assembly the comprehensive report \r\non the work of the Court during the judicial year from \r\n1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013 (A/68/4).\r\nIn 1970, the General Assembly, in its resolution \r\n2625 (XXV), developed the principle of peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes as one of the main \r\ntenets of international law concerning friendly relations \r\nand cooperation among States in accordance with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Some years later, \r\nthat principle was ratified by the Manila Declaration, \r\naccepted by the General Assembly in 1982 as resolution \r\n37/10. It highlights the worked carried out by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the Organization and states that legal disputes \r\nshould, in general, be submitted to the Court.\r\nIn 2012, in adopting the Declaration of the High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels (resolution 67/1), the General \r\nAssembly recognized the positive contribution to peace \r\nand international security made by the International \r\nCourt of Justice through, among other things, its \r\ndecisions on disputes between States and its promotion \r\nof international law. Consequently, the Assembly \r\nreaffirmed the obligation of all States to comply with \r\nits decisions in cases to which they are parties, and \r\nurged those States that had not yet done so to consider \r\naccepting its jurisdiction.\r\nPeru, pursuant to its tradition of full respect \r\nfor international law, has accepted the compulsory \r\ninitiate a process leading to the eventual acceptance of \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nA year ago, on the occasion of the High-level Meeting \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels (see A/67/PV.3), which took place under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations on 24 September 2012, \r\nthe Romanian Minister for Foreign Affairs announced \r\nRomania’s intention to initiate an internal debate on \r\nthe acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nThe public debate was launched on 4 February 2013, \r\nwith the organization in Bucharest of a conference on \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice and the four years since the Court’s judgment \r\nin the case concerning Maritime Delimitation in the \r\nBlack Sea (Romania v. Ukraine). The event had two-\r\nfold significance: recalling the execution of the Court’s \r\njudgment in the case concerning the delimitation of the \r\ncontinental shelf and the exclusive economic zones of \r\nRomania and Ukraine in the Black Sea, and the formal \r\nlaunching of the public debate on the acceptance by \r\nRomania of the Court’s jurisdiction.\r\nThe connection between the two issues is obvious. \r\nThe 2009 judgment of the Court represented undeniable \r\nproof of the impartiality and professionalism of the \r\nInternational Court, thus strongly advocating in favour \r\nof the acceptance by Romania of its jurisdiction. Other \r\npublic conferences on the subject were organized in \r\nseveral important legal studies centres in Romania, \r\nwhich were all well attended, in particular by \r\nrepresentatives of academia.\r\nThat internal process was concluded by an event \r\nthat took place on 14 June at the Faculty of Law of the \r\nUniversity of Bucharest. President Tomka attended the \r\nevent and delivered a very eloquent speech explaining \r\nthe significance of accepting the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and \r\nwhy it would be advantageous for Romania, as well as \r\nfor any other State, for that matter, to take such a step. \r\nI avail myself of the opportunity to thank President \r\nTomka again for kindly accepting our invitation to visit \r\nRomania and take part in the conference.\r\nFollowing the internal debate, the meaning of \r\naccepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\nbecame clearer — for both the practitioners of \r\ninternational law in Romania and the general public — in \r\nterms of what was involved from a legal perspective \r\nand, perhaps more significantly and more broadly, in \r\n10/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\ncapacities. We therefore support the report and the \r\n2014-2015 budget.\r\nMs. Natividad (Philippines): We thank President \r\nPeter Tomka and his team at The Hague for the \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice over the past year (A/68/4). \r\nThe Philippines associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe Court continues to play a vital role in \r\ninternational relations. As the principal judicial organ \r\nof the United Nations, the Court resolves disputes \r\nwhich cannot otherwise be resolved by or through the \r\npolitical organs of the United Nations. Under Article \r\n38 of the Statute of the Court, these are disputes that \r\ncan be settled through the application of the sources \r\nof international law — treaties, international custom, \r\ngeneral principles of law and, as subsidiary sources, \r\njudicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly \r\nqualified authors.\r\nLast year, for the first time ever, the General \r\nAssembly held the High-level Meeting on the Rule \r\nof Law at the National and International Levels. We \r\nadopted an outcome document as resolution 67/1. That \r\ndocument recognizes that, within the United Nations \r\nsystem and beyond, we have the institutions, working \r\nmethods and relationships needed to make the rule of \r\nlaw relevant to peace and security, human rights and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nOne of those institutions is none other than the \r\nCourt. In paragraph 31 of the outcome document of \r\nthe High-level Meeting, we recognized the Court’s \r\npositive contribution to promoting the rule of law. We \r\nalso affirmed our duty to comply with its decisions \r\nin contentious cases. We are reminded of Article 1, \r\nparagraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nour duty\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”.\r\nThis is the very rationale for the 1982 Manila \r\nDeclaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International \r\nDisputes (resolution 37/10), the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of which we celebrated in November \r\nlast year. The Manila Declaration was negotiated and \r\njurisdiction of the Court in contentious cases and \r\nstrongly supports the campaign launched by the \r\nSecretary-General aimed at extending that jurisdiction \r\nto all States. \r\nStates must also ensure that the Court has adequate \r\nresources to do its job. We therefore agree with the \r\nrecommendation made in the report on the need to \r\nestablish three new posts, which would strengthen the \r\nmanagement of the workload of the Court.\r\nWe are pleased to note in the report that the \r\nworkload is ever more intense and that cases submitted \r\nto the Court are increasingly complex. That accounts \r\nfor the growing number of States placing their trust \r\nin its serious and impartial character, in its viability \r\nas a peaceful option and in its capacity to promote \r\nthe rule of law at the international level. We note that \r\nhalf of the disputes currently before the Court relate to \r\nLatin American countries, which reinforces peace and \r\nstability in our region.\r\nAs President Tomka mentioned, the past year \r\nsaw the holding of the oral phase of the maritime \r\ndelimitation process involving my country and Chile. \r\nFor the first time in its history, the Court allowed \r\nunofficial simultaneous interpretation into Spanish. As \r\na result of that and of the use of audiovisual technology \r\non its website, mass public opinion in both countries \r\nwas able to follow the hearings in their entirety and \r\nform a comprehensive understanding of the controversy \r\nin question and the functioning of the Court.\r\nAt the conclusion of the oral phase, we were able \r\nto commend the decorous, harmonious and respectful \r\nconduct of both parties. In keeping with that the \r\nAssembly said more than 30 years ago in the Manila \r\nDeclaration, it was found that recourse to the Court \r\nis an opportunity for States to promote the mutual \r\nconfidence in which to pursue the peace and security \r\nthat our people yearn for and deserve.\r\nIn that spirit, at the opening of the general debate \r\nof this session of the Assembly (see A/68/PV.8), the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru, Ollanta Humala \r\nTasso, said that it is a matter of pride for our country \r\nthat we have dealt with our maritime boundary dispute \r\nwith Chile in a constructive and cooperative manner. \r\nMy delegation therefore understands very well that the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Court, to be observed \r\nin 2016, is an important opportunity to raise greater \r\nawareness of its contributions to the international \r\ncommunity in its advisory and dispute settlement \r\n13-53979 11/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nexperience of the International Court of Justice, can \r\nteach us, it is that if their cause is just, the weak should \r\nhave no fear of the mighty. It is through the work of the \r\nCourt that the rule of law in international relations has \r\na chance to prevail. In accordance with the provisions \r\nof resolutions 67/1 and 67/97, the Philippines renews \r\nits call on Member States that have not yet done so to \r\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nFinally, we also call on the Security Council to \r\ntake Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\ninto serious consideration, and to make greater use \r\nof the Court as a source of advisory opinions and of \r\ninterpretation of the relevant norms of international \r\nlaw, particularly on the most current and controversial \r\nissues affecting international peace and security.\r\nMr. Diener Sala (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Mexico wishes to express its deep \r\nappreciation to the International Court of Justice for its \r\nhard work this year and to welcome its annual report \r\n(A/68/4). Mexico would also like to commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his hard work and commitment to \r\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with \r\nthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, through \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to Assist States in \r\nthe Settlement of Disputes through the International \r\nCourt of Justice, created in 1989 to facilitate States’ \r\napplications to the Court to resolve their differences.\r\nMy country reaffirms its confidence in the Court \r\nas the principal international organ of justice and in \r\nits commitment to the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, particularly the duty \r\nof States to resort to peaceful means to settle their \r\ndisputes and comply with international law and the \r\nprinciple of justice. My delegation also congratulates \r\nthe Court on the judgments it has produced during the \r\npast year. Mexico stresses the confidence that States \r\nhave in the Court’s ability to improve understanding of \r\nthe cases brought before it as well as the commitment of \r\nthe countries on both sides to abide by their obligation \r\nto settle disputes peacefully.\r\nMy country reaffirms its respect for and recognition \r\nof the value of the Court’s decisions for the development \r\nof international law regardless of their source, as laid \r\ndown in article 38 of its Statute. As has been expressed \r\nin various forums, Mexico is convinced that the work \r\nof the International Court of Justice in the resolution \r\nof disputes is crucial to the promotion of and respect \r\nfor the rule of law in the international arena. Mexico \r\nadopted by the General Assembly during the Cold War, \r\nwhen non-aligned countries were seeking to consolidate \r\ntheir political and economic independence. The \r\nDeclaration supported their aspirations by articulating \r\nthe norms for the peaceful settlement of disputes, as \r\noutlined in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nBeginning with the Corfu Channel case in 1947 \r\nuntil the adoption in 1982 of the Manila Declaration, \r\nover the span of 35 years the Court disposed of 49 \r\ncontentious cases. Since 1982, however, the caseload \r\nof the Court has increased, and the Court disposed of \r\n78 contentious cases in a comparatively shorter period.\r\nThe 10 contentious cases currently on the Court’s \r\ndocket come from all over the world: half from Latin \r\nAmerica, two cases involving States from the Asia-\r\nPacific region, and others from Africa. That increasing \r\nconfidence, especially among developing countries, \r\nin the capabilities, credibility and impartiality of the \r\nCourt to settle disputes exclusively by peaceful means \r\nis not unrelated to the norms, values and aspirations \r\narticulated in the Manila Declaration. The most \r\nfundamental of them is the non-use or threat of use of \r\nforce. The Manila Declaration reflects the international \r\ncommunity’s increasing reliance on the rule of law as \r\na cornerstone not only of the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, but also of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nOnly the strong rule of law at the international \r\nlevel can guarantee the respect, order and stability that \r\nwe desire and deserve. That is how we contribute to \r\nthe progressive development of international law. The \r\nmandate and jurisdiction of the Court have become \r\nsharper than ever. The creation of the International \r\nCriminal Court and specialized mechanisms for \r\nsettling disputes, such as the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Law of the Sea and the Appellate Body of the World \r\nTrade Organization, do not make the Court any less \r\nimportant in the twenty-first century. On the contrary, \r\nthe new international legal architecture strengthens \r\nthe Court as the only forum for resolving adjudicable \r\ndisputes between States in the vast field of general \r\ninternational law. In fact, the Court is still seized of \r\ndisputes concerning territorial and maritime issues, \r\nenvironmental damage and the conservation of living \r\nresources.\r\nIf there is anything that the Charter of the United \r\nNations, together with the Statute, jurisprudence and \r\n12/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nindependent international justice, whose authoritative \r\nopinion on highly complex disputes will continue to \r\ncontribute to strengthening international law.\r\nMr. Joyini (South Africa): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nPeter Tomka, for his presentation and for the Court’s \r\nreport (A/68/4).\r\nAt the outset, I associate myself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nMy delegation continues to consider the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to be the pre-eminent \r\nmechanism for the peaceful settlement of disputes at \r\nthe international level. It should be kept in mind that the \r\nCourt, as a court of justice and, moreover, the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, occupies a special \r\nposition. Everything it does is aimed at promoting \r\nthe rule of law. It hands down judgments and gives \r\nadvisory opinions in accordance with its Statute, which \r\nis an integral part of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand thus contributes to promoting and clarifying \r\ninternational law.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and the reaffirmed \r\nconfidence that States have shown in its ability to \r\nresolve their disputes. In particular, we are pleased to \r\nsee that States continue to refer disputes to the Court.\r\nThe number of pending cases on the Court’s docket \r\nis a reflection of the esteem in which the States hold it. \r\nWe note with particular appreciation the information \r\nprovided by the Court that the parties to the case of Armed \r\nActivities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo v. Uganda) are making progress \r\nin the implementation of the Court’s judgment of \r\n19 December 2005. That case also technically remains \r\npending in the sense that the parties could again turn to \r\nthe Court, as they are entitled to do under the judgment, \r\nto decide the question of reparation if they are unable to \r\nagree on that point.\r\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of mechanisms \r\nfor the international judicial settlement of disputes on \r\na specialized or regional basis, the International Court \r\nof Justice continues to attract a wide range of cases, \r\ncovering many areas.\r\nThe list of cases pending before the Court includes \r\nthose pertaining to the demarcation of boundaries, such \r\nas Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger), wherein a joint \r\nwould like to commend the Secretary of the Court for \r\ndoing three high-level jobs — in the legal, diplomatic \r\nand administrative arenas — in carrying out his work. \r\nFinally, Mexico urges those States that have not \r\nyet done so to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as soon as possible, in \r\nkeeping with paragraph 2 of article 36 of the Statute, in \r\norder to fulfil their duty to settle disputes peacefully, \r\nwith respect for international law and the principle of \r\ngood faith.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We would also like to thank the President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, Mr. Peter Tomka, for \r\nhis detailed briefing on the work of the Court.\r\nRussia is traditionally committed to the principle \r\nof the peaceful resolution of disputes, and the rule of \r\nlaw. We consider the International Court of Justice to \r\nbe very important as a key organ dealing with settling \r\ndisputes between States and ensuring the primacy of \r\nthe rule of law in international relations.\r\nWe have been closely monitoring the progress of \r\nthe judicial proceedings of the Court, whose current \r\nphase is one of the most active in its entire history. \r\nDuring the most recent reporting period it issued two \r\njudgments on highly complex territorial disputes and \r\nheld substantive hearings on four cases. The Court \r\nhas also maintained a broad range of subject matter \r\nin the cases before it, confirming its universality and \r\npopularity among States. In our view, the energy of \r\nthe Court’s proceedings is a not insignificant factor in \r\ncreating confidence in it. Moreover, it has continued \r\nto maintain the quality of its decisions, which not only \r\nrespond to the issues that States present it with but \r\nalso lay a foundation for the development of modern \r\ninternational law, at the same high level.\r\nRussia has had the opportunity through its own \r\nexperience to be convinced of the Court’s high standards \r\nin its legal proceedings. In that regard, the Court should \r\nbe an example to other international judicial bodies, \r\nparticularly the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda, whose low level of effectiveness \r\nhas long been a subject of discussion in the Organization.\r\nWe believe that in order to develop the potential of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, it must have help in \r\naddressing its practical and material problems. We are \r\nconfident that the Court will be a model of objective, \r\n13-53979 13/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\navailing itself of its right to intervene, it accepts that the \r\nconstruction given by the judgment in the case will be \r\nequally binding upon it.\r\nThe importance of advisory opinions on legal \r\nquestions referred to the International Court of Justice \r\ncannot be overstated in the pursuit of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It is therefore rather disappointing \r\nthat during the period under review, no requests for \r\nadvisory opinions were made.\r\nMr. Gálvez (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): Allow me to \r\nconvey my country’s greetings to the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Peter Tomka, who \r\nintroduced a comprehensive report covering the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013 (A/68/4).\r\nWe value the lofty responsibilities of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and its work as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations. The report introduced by \r\nthe Court’s President clearly reflects that tradition and \r\ndeserves our gratitude. \r\nAs members of the international community, \r\nwe share with other nations respect for the Court’s \r\ninstitutional structure, its mission and its work \r\nreflecting the pre-eminence of international law. \r\nWe add our voice to those that have highlighted the \r\nfundamental advisory function entrusted to the Court \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations, which it has \r\nperformed with exemplary clarity and commitment, \r\nproviding, through its findings and rulings, guidelines \r\nand counsel to the United Nations and to the States in \r\ngeneral. We particularly emphasize the contribution \r\nof the Court to relations between States by applying \r\ninternational law and contributing to its effectiveness.\r\nThis year we celebrate the centennial anniversary \r\nof the Peace Palace, which is the headquarters of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and the Permanent Court \r\nof Arbitration and which once housed the Permanent \r\nInternational Court of Justice. The 100 years of existence \r\nof the Peace Palace illustrate the determination of \r\npeoples to resolve their disputes on the basis of \r\ninternational law by peaceful means and thereby to \r\npromote international peace and security. My country \r\ncannot fail to highlight the contribution to the legacy of \r\ninternational law, especially Latin American law, made \r\nby Chilean legal expert Alejandro Álvarez, among the \r\nearliest Judges of the Court.\r\nThe Court is an essential component of the \r\ninternational legal system, and our States acknowledge \r\nletter of notification dated 12 May 2010 was transmitted \r\nto the Registrar as a special agreement, whereby both \r\ncountries agreed to submit to the Court the frontier \r\ndispute between them over a section of their common \r\nboundary. In the Court’s judgment dated 16 April 2013, \r\nthe Court settled that long-standing border dispute \r\nbetween the two countries by demarcating territory \r\nthat spans an area of 380 kilometres, which is over half \r\nthe length of the border. By an order dated 12 July 2013, \r\nthe Court nominated three experts who would assist the \r\nparties in the demarcation of their common frontier in \r\nthe disputed area, pursuant to  article 7, paragraph 4, of \r\nthe special agreement concluded between the parties on \r\n24 February 2009 and to paragraph 113 of the judgment \r\ndelivered by the Court on 16 April 2013.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the fact that the Court \r\nsets itself a particularly demanding schedule of hearings \r\nand deliberations in order to consider several cases at \r\nthe same time and to deal as promptly as possible with \r\nincidental proceedings, which are tending to increase, \r\nincluding requests for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures, preliminary measures, counterclaims, \r\napplications for permission to intervene and declarations \r\nof intervention. \r\nWe keenly await the Court’s judgment in the Aerial \r\nHerbicide Spraying (Ecuador v. Colombia) case and \r\nhope that it will contribute to the relevant principles. We \r\nhave also noted that another environmental case — that \r\nconcerning Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. \r\nJapan) — has been added to the Court’s docket. We \r\nlook forward to the Court’s decision in that case, which \r\nwe hope will similarly contribute to the body of law \r\ngoverning the environment, particularly in respect to \r\nthe law of the sea.\r\nMy delegation has also noted that through an order \r\nof 6 February 2013, the Court authorized New Zealand \r\nto intervene in the case concerning Whaling in the \r\nAntarctic (Australia v. Japan). On 20 November 2012, \r\nNew Zealand filed with the Registry a declaration \r\nof intervention in the case. In order to avail itself of \r\nthe right of intervention conferred by Article 63 of \r\nthe Statute of the Court, New Zealand relied on its \r\nstatus as a party to the International Convention for \r\nthe Regulation of Whaling. It contended that as a \r\nparty to the Convention, it had a direct interest in the \r\nconstruction that might be placed upon the Convention \r\nby the Court in its decision in these proceedings. New \r\nZealand underlined in its declaration that it did not seek \r\nto be a party to the proceedings and confirmed that, by \r\n14/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nof Justice, for introducing the comprehensive report \r\ncovering the judicial activities of the Court over the \r\npast year (A/68/4). I also thank him and Vice-President \r\nBernardo Sepúlveda-Amor for guiding the work of the \r\nCourt.\r\nAs the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the Court is entrusted with the task of \r\npromoting the peaceful resolution of disputes between \r\nStates, which is fundamental to the fulfilment of one \r\nof the purposes of the United Nations, namely, the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. We \r\nacknowledge the fact that the Court has fulfilled that \r\ntask admirably since its establishment and that it has \r\nacquired a well-deserved reputation as an impartial \r\ninstitution maintaining the highest legal standards in \r\naccordance with its mandate under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, of which the Statute of the Court is an \r\nintegral part.\r\nOne of the primary goals of the United Nations, as \r\nstated in the Preamble to the Charter, is to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for \r\ninternational obligations can be maintained. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as the only Court with \r\ngeneral international law jurisdiction, is uniquely \r\nplaced to fulfil that role.\r\nThe Court’s report illustrates the importance that \r\nStates attach to the Court and the confidence they place \r\nin it, as is clearly evident from the number, nature and \r\nvariety of cases it deals with and through its ability to \r\naddress the complex aspects of public international \r\nlaw. The cases before the Court involve a wide \r\nvariety of subjects, including territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes, environmental damage, the conservation \r\nof living resources, violations of territorial integrity, \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights, genocide, the interpretation and application \r\nof international conventions and treaties, and the \r\ninterpretation of the Court’s own judgments.\r\nThe judgments delivered by the International \r\nCourt of Justice have played an important role in \r\nthe interpretation and clarification of the rules of \r\ninternational law, as embodied in the progressive \r\ndevelopment and codification of international law. In \r\nthe performance of its judicial functions, the Court \r\nhas remained highly sensitive to political realities and \r\nsentiments of taste by acting in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations, its own \r\nStatute and other applicable rules of international law.\r\nand appreciate its leading role and the guarantees \r\nprovided to all members of the international \r\ncommunity under its sphere of competence. Through \r\nits decisions, the Court has facilitated the establishment \r\nof an international legal order designed to strengthen \r\nthe peaceful coexistence of peoples. As President \r\nTomka stated, the jurisdiction of the Court arises from \r\nmultilateral and bilateral treaties and from the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of States, all in conformity with the system \r\nprescribed in the Rome Statute.\r\nThe system of judicial settlement of disputes \r\nidentified by the Court embodies one of the essential \r\ngoals of the international legal order concerning the \r\nstability of relations among States and the solidity of the \r\nrules in force. We are convinced that, in the framework \r\nof international peace and security, the Court helps to \r\nenhance relations between countries and to impose on \r\nthe international legal order a sense of respect for the \r\nlaw, the concept of the rule of law and human rights, \r\ncombining the fundamental principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations with the requirements of modern \r\nlife.\r\nWe join with others in the General Assembly in \r\nexpressing respect and support for the Court as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations system \r\nin the conviction that the Organization will continue to \r\ngive it the autonomy and to provide it with the human \r\nand material resources necessary, commensurate with \r\nits caseload and lofty functions. \r\nIn that connection, we value the participation of \r\nexperts and the specialized technical knowledge that \r\nthey contribute. My country highly values the Court’s \r\npublic dissemination of its work and the access it \r\nprovides to its teachings and activities. We hope that it \r\nwill receive the resources to pursue those efforts with \r\nthe requisite means and technologies. We know how \r\nhard the Court strives to disseminate its work and to \r\nsupport the work of those who consult its documents. \r\nInternational law is undoubtedly strengthened by that \r\neffort. We want to do our part to ensure that this stance \r\ncontinues to prevail among our countries.\r\nTo conclude, I recall that recognition of the \r\npraiseworthy work of the Court over which Judge \r\nTomka presides goes hand in hand with respect for \r\ninternational law and makes a vital contribution to its \r\neffectiveness and application.\r\nMs. Patil (India): At the outset, I would like to thank \r\nJudge Peter Tomka, President of the International Court \r\n13-53979 15/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\ncommunity continues to increase. Cases referred to the \r\nCourt involve a wide variety of subjects, including \r\nterritorial and maritime disputes, environmental \r\ndisputes and violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law.\r\nWhile the issues on which Member States file \r\nclaims with the Court are growing more complex in \r\nfactual and legal terms, Japan is confident that the Court \r\nwill maintain the high quality of its work through the \r\njudicial rigour of its members and with the support of its \r\nhighly dedicated Registry, an element that truly makes \r\nthe Court the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. Japan commends the Court for its continuing \r\nefforts to examine its procedures and working methods \r\nin order to conduct its work in a sustainable manner, \r\nwhile assuming the challenging task of guaranteeing its \r\nimpartiality against political pressures and maintaing \r\nits respect for equality between the parties to disputes.\r\nAs Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said from this \r\nrostrum during the general debate of the current session \r\n(see A/68/PV.12), Japan attaches great importance \r\nto enhancing the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. Indeed, there are rising expectations across \r\nthe globe for international law to serve as a means \r\nfor resolving heated controversies and diffusing \r\ntensions by providing those involved with a common \r\nlanguage. My Government strongly believes that the \r\ninternational community must seize this moment to \r\nmake international law play a more important role \r\nin international relations. The universal acceptance \r\nof the Court’s jurisdiction by Member States would \r\nenable the enhancement of this function by the Court. \r\nJapan itself has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the International Court of Justice since 1958. Our \r\ndelegation calls upon all Member States that have not \r\ndone so to follow suit.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to refer \r\nto Japan’s experience in the peaceful of settlement of \r\ndisputes through the international judicial process. \r\nThis year has been an important one for Japan as it \r\nhas participated in all the proceedings of Japan’s first \r\nCourt case in its history concerning the legality of \r\nJapan’s special whaling permit in the Antarctic. As \r\nJapan’s agent stated in his concluding remarks, the oral \r\nproceedings gave Japan the opportunity to thoroughly \r\npresent its case about the Japanese research whaling \r\nto the Court and, by extension, to the entire world. In \r\nthat sense, Japan demonstrated, based on law and facts, \r\nthat its special whaling permit was in full accordance \r\nDuring the 2012-2013 judicial year, the Court \r\ndelivered two judgments, held public hearings in \r\nfour cases and handed down six orders. The number \r\nof continuing cases presently on the Court’s docket \r\nstands at 10. Among the cases before the Court, there \r\nare five from Latin American States, two from Europe, \r\none each from African and Asian States and one of an \r\nintercontinental character, which shows the universality \r\nof the Court.\r\nThe Court’s second function of providing advisory \r\nopinions on legal questions referred to it by the organs \r\nand specialized agencies of the United Nations adds \r\nto its important role of clarifying key international \r\nlegal issues. The Court’s report rightly points out that \r\neverything the Court does is aimed at promoting the \r\nrule of law, in particular through its judgments and \r\nadvisory opinions.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the Court ensures the \r\ngreatest possible global awareness of its decisions \r\nthrough its publications, multimedia offerings and \r\nits website, which now features the Court’s entire \r\njurisprudence as well as that of its predecessor, the \r\nPermanent Court of International Justice. Those \r\nsources provide useful information for States wishing \r\nto submit a potential dispute to the Court.\r\nWe are glad to note that the three posts sought by \r\nthe Court in different service categories have been \r\nfilled pursuant to the approval of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich will help to strengthen the Court’s security-\r\nrelated aspects and will expedite the publication of the \r\nCourt’s work. It is also a matter of satisfaction that the \r\nGreat Hall of Justice, in which public hearings are held, \r\nhas been refurbished with modern equipment.\r\nFinally, India wishes to reaffirms its strong support \r\nto the Court and acknowledges the importance that the \r\ninternational community attaches to its work.\r\nMr. Ishikawa (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank President Peter Tomka for introducing the \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice (A/68/4). His report highlights the ever-\r\nincreasing need for the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nbetween States and the crucial role that the Court plays \r\nin resolving them by applying international law. Allow \r\nme to take this opportunity to commend the work of the \r\nCourt under the leadership of President Tomka.\r\nAs the President’s report clearly points out, the use \r\nof the International Court of Justice as the forum of \r\nchoice for the settlement of disputes in the international \r\n16/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nits workload and its commitment to continually review \r\nand refine its procedures and working methods to keep \r\npace with the rapidly changing times. By working to \r\nresolve some disputes up front, helping to diffuse other \r\ndisputes before they escalate, and providing a trusted \r\nchannel for States to address and resolve disputes about \r\nlegal issues, the Court is fulfilling its Chapter XIV \r\nmandate. We hope the Court will continue to receive \r\nappropriate resources for carrying out its important \r\nfunctions.\r\nWe also want to commend the Court’s continued \r\npublic outreach to educate key sectors of society — law \r\nprofessors and students, judicial officials, Government \r\nofficials and the general public — on the work of the \r\nCourt and to increase understanding of the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. From a transparency \r\nstandpoint, we note in particular that the Court’s \r\nproceedings are now available to watch live and on \r\ndemand on United Nations Web TV. All these efforts \r\ncomplement and expand the efforts of the United \r\nNations to promote the rule of law globally and a better \r\nunderstanding of public international law.\r\nIn closing, we want to express our appreciation for \r\nthe hard work of President Tomka, the other judges who \r\ncurrently serve on the Court, and all of the members of \r\nthe Court’s staff who contribute on a daily basis to the \r\ncontinuing productive work of that institution.\r\nMr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo) (spoke in French): My delegation takes \r\nnote of the report submitted to the General Assembly \r\nby the International Court of Justice (A/68/4), covering \r\nthe period from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013. We note \r\nthat during the reporting period, 12 contentious cases \r\nwere brought before the Court, which delivered two \r\njudgments and eight orders.\r\nMy delegation attaches great importance to the \r\nwork of the International Court of Justice because it \r\nrecognizes that, as the principal body of the United \r\nNations, its role is to bring about by peaceful means, \r\nand in conformity with the principles of justice \r\nand internatinoal law, adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations which might lead to \r\na breach of the peace. My delegation appreciates the \r\noutstanding role played by the Court in promoting the \r\nrule of law and encourages it to pursue its efforts in this \r\ndirection.\r\nWe must recognize the skill with which the Court \r\nhas conducted its deliberations in the cases before it \r\nwith the International Convention for the Regulation \r\nof Whaling. Japan trusts that the Court will arrive \r\nat its conclusion based on the clearly presented legal \r\narguments and factual evidence.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate Japan’s unwavering \r\nsupport for the Court.\r\nMs. Bagley (United States of America): We would \r\nlike to thank President Tomka for his leadership as \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, and for \r\nthe Court’s recent report regarding its activities over \r\nthe past year (A/68/4). We are struck by the continuing \r\nforward momentum of the Court reflected in the report.\r\nOver the past year, the Court has issued two judgments \r\nrelated to the demarcation of boundaries both on land \r\nand in the sea and six orders, and held hearings open to \r\nthe public in four complex cases. In addition, the Court \r\nhas 10 more contentious cases in its pipeline spanning \r\nthe gamut of issues including border disputes — again, \r\nterritorial and maritime — environmental matters and \r\nthe interpretation of treaties among multilateral parties, \r\nto reference just a few. Five of the pending cases are \r\nbetween Latin American States, two between European \r\nStates, one between African States and one between \r\nAsian States, while one is intercontinental in character. \r\nTruly, the caseload of the Court is global and mirrors \r\nthe work of the General Assembly itself in this regard.\r\nThe International Court of Justice is the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. The preamble \r\nof the Charter underscores the determination of its \r\ndrafters\r\n“to establish conditions under which justice and \r\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties \r\nand other sources of international law can be \r\nmaintained”.\r\nThis goal lies at the core of the Charter system, and in \r\nparticular the role of the Court. Taking stock today of \r\napproximately 70 years of the Court’s jurisprudence, \r\nit is clear that the Court has made a significant \r\ncontribution to establishing legal norms and clarifying \r\nlegal principles in multiple areas of international law.\r\nWe see an increased tendency among \r\nStates — reaffirmed again this past year — to take \r\ndisputes to the Court and to vigorously advocate on \r\nbehalf of their interests before it. In turn, the Court \r\nhas continued to become more responsive to them in \r\nmultiple ways, including through measures to enhance \r\nits efficiency to cope in a timely way with the increase in \r\n13-53979 17/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nof international law, both as an applicant and as a \r\nrespondent State. Indeed, it is no fantasy to claim that \r\nfor more than a decade the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo has been one of the main applicant countries \r\nsubmitting cases to the International Court of Justice, \r\nfive of which appear on the current docket and are close \r\nto being decided.\r\nMy delegation supports the activities of the Court \r\nand encourages States to refer their disputes to it in \r\norder to promote peace through the rule of law and \r\nfacilitate peaceful coexistence. It is alarmed to note \r\nthat barely one third of the States Members of the \r\nOrganization have made declarations with respect to \r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of the Court, that\r\n“they recognize as compulsory ipso facto and \r\nwithout special agreement, in relation to any other \r\nstate accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court in all legal disputes”.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation encourages States that \r\nhave not yet done so to adhere to the declaration accepting \r\nthe Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, pursuant to Article \r\n36, paragraph 2, of the Statute and in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of resolution 67/1, of 24 September 2012, \r\nand of resolution 67/97, of 14 December 2012, by which \r\nthe General Assembly calls upon States that have not \r\nyet accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\non that basis to consider doing so.\r\nMy delegation considers this to be an effective \r\nmethod of referral to the Court that allows States parties \r\nto the Statute to recognize as compulsory ipso facto and \r\nwithout special agreement, with respect to any other \r\nState accepting the same obligation, the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court in all legal disputes. The report of the \r\nPresident tell us that, of the 194 States  Members that \r\nmake up this universal Organization, only 70 States, \r\nincluding the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have \r\naccepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction pursuant \r\nto Article 36 of the Statute.\r\nFinally, the fact that many of the statements made \r\nby the representatives of Member States contain \r\nreservations or limitations that exclude certain dispute \r\ncategories or require certain conditions to be met in \r\norder to accept the Court’s competence in the matter \r\nof a dispute represents a practice that my delegation \r\ncannot support.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the Plurinational State \r\nin recent years. It has not only managed an increasing \r\nnumber of cases, but has further established itself as \r\nthe main judicial body of the United Nations mandated \r\nto settle legal disputes that States have submitted to \r\nit, in accordance with international law. Seeking to \r\ndeliver impartial justice, it has also established its \r\nindependence vis-à-vis the Security Council, which is \r\na political body of the United Nations, as occurred in \r\nits judgment of 24 May 1980 in the case concerning \r\nUnited States Diplomatic and Consular Staff in Tehran \r\n(United States of America v. Iran), following the events \r\nof 4 November 1979.\r\nRegarding recourse to the use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \r\nState, or in any other manner inconsistent with the \r\npurposes of the United Nations, referred to in Article \r\n2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the United Nations, I \r\nrefer to the 19 December 2005 Judgment rendered by \r\nthe Court in the case concerning Armed Activities on \r\nthe Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo v. Uganda), cited in paragraph 31 of the report \r\nof the International Court of Justice. As the eminent \r\nCongolese jurist Sayeman Bula-Bula once said, this \r\ncase surpassed the case concerning Corfu Channel \r\n(United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nv. Albania) of 1949, the case concerning Border and \r\nTransborder Armed Actions (Nicaruaga v. Honduras) of \r\n1986, and the case concerning Oil Platforms (Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran v. United States of America) of 2003. \r\nWhile the Court’s observations could have been more \r\nclearly expressed in its decision, as some have rightly \r\nsaid, they still stand regardless of their semantics. In \r\nthat regard, it is important to closely read the entirety \r\nof the judgment, in particular paragraphs 153, 304 and \r\n345.\r\nIn his report on this subject, the President of the \r\nCourt lays out the development of the negotiations held \r\nby parties to settle the question of reparations. Given \r\nthe friendly relations and climate of cooperation that \r\nhave progressively been re-established between the \r\nformer belligerent parties, my delegation hopes that the \r\nissue of reparations will find a just, prompt and fair \r\nsolution through the means stipulated in the judgment \r\nof 19 December 2005.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo has \r\nmade a valuable contribution to the development of \r\ninternational law and to what is known today as “the \r\nreturn to international law”. Our enormous contribution \r\nhas allowed us to adhere to the rule of law, respectful \r\n18/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and \r\nto accept its rulings in order to reaffirm respect for \r\ninternational law and the quest for peace, international \r\nsecurity and justice.\r\nMr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): It is an \r\nhonour to participate once again in the annual meeting \r\nof the General Assembly to consider the report on the \r\nwork of the International Court of Justice, which is the \r\nonly international tribunal of a universal character with \r\ngeneral jurisdiction. My delegation thanks Judge Peter \r\nTomka, President of the Court, for his introduction of \r\nthe report on the work of the Court (A/68/4) and for his \r\nimportant appearance before the Assembly.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes is \r\nan essential purpose of the United Nations. The role of \r\nthe Court in maintaining peace and security is therefore \r\ncritical, giving rise to the responsibility of the United \r\nNations and its Member States to support the Court \r\nin fulfilling its duties and to scrupulously implement \r\nits decisions, as well as the importance of ensuring its \r\nlegal and procedural independence.\r\nTo that end, the Court must, inter alia, enjoy the \r\nnecessary resources to fulfil its mandate, in view of \r\nthe substantial increase in its workload. In that matter, \r\nand thanks to the support of the Organization and the \r\nefforts of the Court, we welcome the elimination of the \r\ncase-processing backlog and the fact that the conclusion \r\nof the written phase can now lead seamlessly to the oral \r\nproceedings.\r\nA basic minimum requirement of strengthening \r\nrespect for the rule of law and the Court itself is the \r\nrespect and compliance of States with it decisions, \r\nincluding orders, opinions or even precautionary \r\nmeasures imposed on parties to a dispute. Such \r\nmeasures, as the Court has pointed out, are “binding \r\n... and therefore, create international ... obligations”. \r\nThere must be full compliance based on good faith to \r\nensure the integrity of each process and consolidate the \r\nundisputed role of the Court in ensuring justice, peace \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes. Costa Rica \r\nbelieves that the time has come to provide a procedure \r\nto follow up the Court’s decisions and to reflect cases of \r\nnon-compliance in order to avoid situations that violate \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nAlthough 193 countries are party to the Statute \r\nof the Court, only 67 have recognized its compulsory \r\njurisdiction in accordance with Article 36, paragraphs \r\n2 and 5, of of the Statute. Costa Rica has accepted its \r\nof Bolivia, I extend our warm welcome and thanks to \r\nJudge Peter Tomka, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, for introducing the extensive report detailing \r\nthe work of the Court from 1 August 2012 to 31 July \r\n2013 (A/68/4).\r\nThe International Court of Justice represents the \r\nprimary embodiment of universal justice as understood \r\nby the international community. It serves above all as \r\na mechanism for the peaceful and just settlement of \r\ndisputes based on legal agreement, which is considered \r\nto be the civilized way to address differences among \r\nStates.\r\nProgress in international law made it possible to \r\nbanish old practices, such as unilateral acts to assert \r\npower by strong nations over weak ones, the prohibition \r\nof the threat or use of force and the unilateral imposition \r\nof power by strong nations over weak, the prohibition \r\nof the threat or use of force, and the elimination of the \r\nright of States to territorial conquest. \r\nThe indisputable guarantor has been the \r\nInternational Court of Justice as the main judicial body \r\nof the United Nations system charged with protecting \r\nthe interests of the parties concerned, as well as those \r\nof any State affected by a dispute. In that context, it \r\nis important to highlight the resolutions of the United \r\nNations that crystallize the principles of international \r\nlaw and have served as the basis for the judgments of \r\nthe Court.\r\nBolivia therefore reiterates its adherence to \r\nthe Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement \r\nof International Disputes (resolution 37/10). The \r\ncurrent tendency of States to refer their disputes to \r\nthat mechanism is a clear and healthy sign that they \r\nacting in accordance with the most up-to-date legal \r\npractices of the international community, which, \r\ninstead of deepening antagonism, reduce controversies \r\nand maintain friendly relations that are not tainted by \r\naggression.\r\nIt is the keen desire of the great majority of the \r\nmembers of the international community that the \r\nmechanism for the judicial settlement of disputes, the \r\nresponsibility for which falls to the International Court \r\nof Justice, will be accepted in a comprehensive manner \r\nin such a way that, each day, increasing numbers of \r\nStates will accept the Court’s jurisdiction with a view to \r\nrecognizing its role as a protagonist in the maintenance \r\nof international peace. In that context, we urge the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to recognize the \r\n13-53979 19/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song (International Criminal \r\nCourt): It is an honour to appear for the fifth time \r\nbefore the Assembly to introduce the annual report of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (see A/68/314). As \r\nmembers are aware, the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) is an independent institution, but it was born \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. The two \r\norganizations engage in practical cooperation under \r\nthe Relationship Agreement concluded in the spirit of \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express the \r\nICC’s deep gratitude for the United Nations steadfast \r\nsupport of the Court in the context of global efforts \r\nto strengthen the rule of law and to promote peace, \r\nsecurity and human rights everywhere.\r\nSince I last addressed the Assembly (see \r\nA/67/PV.29), Côte d’Ivoire has become the 122nd State \r\nparty to the Rome Statute. Nine further States parties \r\nhave ratified the amendments to the Rome Statute \r\non the crime of aggression, and 10 States parties \r\nhave ratified the amendment, which makes the use of \r\nchemical weapons in non-international conflicts a war \r\ncrime punishable by the International Criminal Court. \r\nI congratulate those countries on strengthening the \r\ninternational fight against impunity through the Rome \r\nStatute system. I also encourage all States to consider \r\nratifying these instruments if they have not already \r\ndone so.\r\nAllow me to recall that the International Criminal \r\nCourt does not have universal jurisdiction. The Court \r\ncan prosecute crimes committed on the territory of a \r\nState party or by a national of a State party. The only \r\nexception is that the Security Council can decide to \r\nrefer a situation to the ICC Prosecutor under Chapter \r\nVII of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn the past year, the ICC has continued to work \r\nvery hard on the mandate that States have given it. \r\nThe Prosecutor has opened an eighth investigation, \r\nin Mali. The Court has issued its first judgement of \r\nacquittal, which is now on appeal. Two arrest warrants \r\nwere unsealed and one suspect surrendered to the \r\nCourt. Three trials are continuing and another is set \r\nto start very soon. Several important decisions have \r\nbeen issued, breaking new legal ground in the Court’s \r\njurisprudence.\r\nIn institutional developments, Mr. Herman von \r\nHebel has been sworn in as the new International \r\njurisdiction since 1973, but we note with concern that \r\nin recent years the number of countries recognizing the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court has not grown. \r\nAlthough this has not affected the legal activities of \r\nthe Court, we would respectfully invite States that have \r\nnot as yet done so, to consider using the mechanism \r\nprovided in Article 36 of the Court’s Statute.\r\nFor a number of years the Court has made  significant \r\ncontributions to the development of international law \r\nthrough its judgments and advisory opinions since it \r\nsetted its first case concerning Corfu Channel (United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. \r\nAlbania). In that regard, we applaud the statement made \r\nby the President during the centennial anniversary of \r\nthe Peace Palace:\r\n“[T]he Court will continue to work hard to meet \r\nthese challenges as they arise, always careful \r\nto settle the disputes submitted to it faithfully \r\nand impartially, as dictated by the noble judicial \r\nmission entrusted to it under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.”\r\nCosta Rica reaffirms its absolute respect for the \r\ninstruments and organizations of international law and \r\nits commitment to respecting and complying faithfully \r\nwith all decisions handed down by them. We reiterate \r\nour full trust that the Court it will continue to strengthen \r\npeace and justice through the exercise of its duties.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I take \r\nit that the General Assembly takes note of the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/68/4)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded its consideration \r\nof agena item 72.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 75\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/68/314)\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/68/364 and \r\nA/68/366)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): It is now \r\nmy great honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. I now give him the f loor.\r\n20/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nKivus region of eastern Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo.\r\nIn the situation in the Central African Republic, the \r\ntrial of Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba has continued, with the \r\npresentation of defence evidence expected to conclude \r\nshortly.\r\nIn the situation in Darfur, the Sudan, the trial of \r\nMr. Abdallah Banda is set to commence on 5 May 2014. \r\nThe proceedings against his co-accused, Mr. Saleh \r\nJerbo, were terminated on 5 October on the basis of \r\ninformation indicating that he had died earlier this year. \r\nRegrettably, arrest warrants remain pending against \r\nfour persons suspected of having committed very grave \r\ncrimes in the Darfur situation. The active support of \r\nthe Security Council will be essential in ensuring that \r\nthose persons are brought before the Court to face the \r\ncharges against them in compliance with the Council’s \r\noriginal resolution 1593 (2005).\r\nIn the situation in Libya, questions of admissibility \r\nhave featured significantly in the proceedings during the \r\npast year. As members are aware, the Rome Statute gives \r\nprimacy to national jurisdictions under the principle of \r\ncomplementarity, and if a Government can demonstrate \r\nthat it is genuinely investigating or prosecuting the \r\nperson before the ICC for the same crimes, the ICC will \r\nstep back, declaring the case inadmissible. On 31 May, \r\nPre-Trial Chamber I rejected Libya’s admissibility \r\nchallenge with respect to Mr. Saif Al-Islam Al-Qadhafi \r\nin light of the specific circumstances of that case. Libya \r\nhas appealed against that decision, but remains under a \r\nlegal obligation to transfer Mr. Al-Qadhafi to the ICC.\r\nOn the other hand, on 11 October the Pre-Trial \r\nChamber declared the case of Abdullah Al-Senussi \r\ninadmissible before the ICC, again in light of the \r\nspecific circumstances of the case, opening the way \r\nfor proceedings against Mr. Al-Senussi to continue \r\nat the national level. That was the first decision of \r\nthis kind issued by a Chamber of the ICC. However, \r\nI should stress that the decision has been appealed by \r\nMr. Al-Senussi and is therefore not final.\r\nIn the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, the only suspect \r\ncurrently in the custody of the ICC is Mr. Laurent \r\nGbagbo. Following a hearing on the confirmation \r\nof charges, the Pre-Trial Chamber requested the \r\nProsecutor to consider providing further evidence and \r\ngave her until 15 November to do so. Arrest warrants \r\nagainst two other suspects, Mrs. Simone Gbagbo and \r\nMr. Charles Blé Goudé, were unsealed during the \r\nCriminal Court Registrar and Mr. James Stewart as the \r\nnew Deputy Prosecutor.\r\nI will give a brief overview of the main judicial \r\ndevelopments in the eight situations before the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nTo date, four State parties to the Rome \r\nStatute — Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Central African Republic and Mali — have \r\nreferrred situations occurring on their territories \r\nto the Court. In the two situations in Kenya and the \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, the previous Prosecutor commenced \r\ninvestigations on his own initiative, with the knowledge \r\nand support of the Governments concerned. In addition, \r\nthe Security Council referred the situations in Darfur, \r\nthe Sudan, and in Libya, both of which are non-States \r\nparties.\r\nIn the situation in Uganda, regrettably, the arrest \r\nwarrants against Mr. Joseph Kony and three other \r\nalleged leaders of the Lord’s Resistance Army remain \r\noutstanding. Once again, I implore all States to \r\ncooperate in bringing those persons before justice to \r\nface the very serious charges against them.\r\nIn the situation in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Appeals Chamber is currently considering \r\nappeals against last year’s conviction, sentence and \r\nreparations decision in the case of The Prosecutor v. \r\nThomas Lubanga Dyilo.\r\nOn 21 November 2012, the first judgement of \r\nacquittal at the ICC was issued when Trial Chamber II \r\nfound Mr. Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui not guilty of crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. The Prosecutor’s \r\nappeal against that judgment is also under consideration \r\nby the Appeals Chamber. The trial of Mr. Germain \r\nKatanga has ended and the Trial Chamber is expected \r\nto issue its judgment in the near future.\r\nIn a very welcome development, Mr. Bosco \r\nNtaganda, charged with the use of child soldiers, murder, \r\nrape, sexual slavery and other crimes, was transferred \r\nto the ICC on 22 March. He is the first person subject to \r\nan ICC arrest warrant to have voluntarily surrendered \r\nto the Court. I would like to express the ICC’s gratitude \r\nto the countries that facilitated his transfer. Following a \r\nprocess of disclosure, the hearing on the confirmation \r\nof charges against Mr. Ntaganda is set to commence \r\non 22 February 2014. An arrest warrant against \r\nMr. Sylvestre Mudacumura remains outstanding. He \r\nis charged with alleged war crimes committed in the \r\n13-53979 21/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\naround the world with a view to determining whether \r\nthe opening of a formal ICC investigation is warranted. \r\nThose examinations concern Afghanistan, Colombia, \r\nGeorgia, Guinea, Honduras, the Republic of Korea, \r\nNigeria and, finally, a situation referred by the Union \r\nof the Comoros concerning crimes allegedly committed \r\non 31 May 2010 aboard vessels reportedly registered in \r\nComoros, Greece and Cambodia that formed part of a \r\nf lotilla bound for the Gaza Strip.\r\nFairness is a cornerstone of ICC judicial work. The \r\ninternationally recognized rights of the accused are \r\nmeticulously respected. No one can be convicted unless \r\nhis or her guilt is proved beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\nThe Registry of the ICC makes legal aid available to \r\nthe accused and to victims if they cannot afford legal \r\nrepresentation. The legal aid extended to victims assists \r\nthem in asserting their rights under the Rome Statute \r\nto present their views in the context of cases against \r\nthe suspects and the accused and to seek reparations \r\nfor harm suffered. Thus far, the ICC has provided \r\nlegal assistance to more than 7,000 victims who have \r\nparticipated in the proceedings.\r\nParallel to the judicial proceedings at the Court, the \r\nICC Trust Fund for Victims provides a very concrete \r\nresponse to the urgent needs of numerous victims and \r\ntheir families who have suffered from the worst crimes \r\nunder international law. The Trust Fund currently \r\nsupports 28 projects that reach an estimated 110,000 \r\nvictims and their families in northern Uganda and the \r\neastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nOf those beneficiaries, over 5,000 are survivors of \r\nsexual and gender-based violence. \r\nThe Trust Fund considers the empowerment of \r\nwomen and girls to be a fundamental requirement \r\nof any justice, reparation, assistance, reconciliation \r\nand peacebuilding process. The assistance that the \r\nTrust Fund is able to provide to victims depends upon \r\nvoluntary donations, which are also needed to fund \r\nreparations when a convicted person is indigent. Once \r\nagain, I thank those States that have already generously \r\nsupported the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, and I call on \r\nothers States to consider doing so for the benefit of the \r\nvictims of atrocious crimes.\r\nThe ICC has attracted considerable international \r\nattention in the past months, especially with respect \r\nto Africa. Some voices have urged the Court to show \r\nflexibility on certain issues. I would like to underline \r\nthat while the ICC will naturally try to find practical \r\nreporting period, but the requests for their arrest and \r\nsurrender to the ICC remain outstanding.\r\nIn the situation in Kenya, the trial of Mr. William \r\nSamoei Ruto and Mr. Joshua Arap Sang commenced \r\non 10 September, and the presentation of prosecution \r\nevidence is currently under way. That is the first \r\ncriminal trial hearing before any international court \r\nin which the accused are not in custody, but appear \r\nas free men, having voluntarily complied with the \r\nsummons to appear issued by the ICC. In the light of \r\nrecent submissions by the parties to the other trial in \r\nthe Kenya situation, that of Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, the \r\nChamber earlier today issued a decision postponing the \r\nstart of the trial until 5 February.\r\nA legal question that has recently attracted \r\nconsiderable attention in the Kenya situation is the \r\nrequirement of an accused person’s presence at trial. \r\nThe relevant provision of the Rome Statute is article \r\n63, which provides in its first paragraph that “[t]he \r\naccused shall be present during the trial”. Last week, \r\nthe ICC Appeals Chamber issued its first-ever ruling \r\non the interpretation of that provision, finding that the \r\nabsence of an accused from trial is permissible under \r\nexceptional circumstances when strictly necessary and \r\nif a number of specific criteria are fulfilled, including \r\nthe prior exploration of other possible solutions.\r\nOn 16 January, the Prosecutor formally opened \r\nan investigation into alleged crimes committed on the \r\nterritory of Mali since January 2012, following the Mali \r\nGovernment’s referral of the situation to the Prosecutor \r\nlast year. Based on her preliminary examination, the \r\nProsecutor initially focused her investigation on three \r\nnorthern regions of Mali and on allegations concerning \r\nintentional attacks on buildings dedicated to religion \r\nand historic monuments, including those with World \r\nHeritage status. The Prosecutor has accordingly \r\ncooperated with UNESCO and has sought cooperation \r\nwith a number of other United Nations agencies present \r\nin Mali.\r\nIndeed, United Nations logistical and other types of \r\nassistance are of crucial importance to the ICC’s ability \r\nto conduct effective investigations and other operations \r\nin the situation countries. The ICC is extremely grateful \r\nfor the continuing cooperation with the United Nations \r\nin that respect.\r\nIn addition to the investigations related to the eight \r\nsituations I have just discussed, the ICC Prosecutor is \r\nconducting another eight preliminary examinations \r\n22/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\n(ICC) for its ninth annual report to the United Nations \r\n(see A/68/314), covering the period from 1 August \r\n2012 to 31 July 2013, detailing what is described as \r\nanother increasingly busy year for the ICC.\r\nWe welcome the ratification of the Rome Statute \r\nby Côte D’Ivoire on 15 February, which brought the \r\nnumber of States parties to 122.\r\nWe are firm supporters of the ICC. We note that \r\nwith eight situations under investigation and a further \r\neight under preliminary examination, the ICC is facing \r\nan increasing workload. The Prosecutor is currently \r\ninvestigating more allegations involving more suspects \r\nthan ever before. We acknowledge, in that regard, \r\nthe opening in January of investigations concerning \r\nallegations of crimes occurring in Mali since January \r\n2012. The Court has given hope to victims of the \r\nmost serious crimes, and more than 110,000 victims \r\nhave already benefitted from the concrete assistance \r\nprogrammes of the ICC Trust Fund for Victims.\r\nThe recent report of the ICC describes the efforts \r\nthat the Court has made in fulfilling its mission. It also \r\ndescribes the challenges that the ICC is facing. The \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute, which continues to be \r\none of the main challenges faced by the ICC, is essential \r\nfor ensuring accountability for the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community. \r\nThe perpetrators of such crimes, regardless of their \r\nstatus, must be held accountable for their actions. A \r\nkey element of the Rome Statute is its equal application \r\nto all persons, without distinction based on official \r\ncapacity.\r\nWe need to continue to work tirelessly to make \r\nthe Rome Statute truly universal and to extend the \r\nparticipation to the Agreement on the Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the ICC. In that regard, the EU and \r\nits member States reiterate their call upon all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations not yet parties to the \r\nRome Statute and the Agreement on the Privileges \r\nand Immunities of the ICC to ratify or accede to both \r\nagreements, as well as upon all States parties that have \r\nnot yet done so to implement them under their national \r\nlegal order.\r\nAnother fundamental challenge remains in the \r\nnecessity to ensure cooperation with the ICC, and in \r\nparticular how to react to instances of non-cooperation \r\nof States that are in violation of their obligations with \r\nregard to the ICC. Cooperation with the Court and the \r\nenforcement of its decisions are indeed equally essential \r\nsolutions to the challenges it faces, such solutions must \r\nbe consistent with the legal framework set by States \r\nunder the Rome Statute. That is also what I ask of the \r\nother stakeholders in the ICC system — to uphold the \r\nintegrity of the Rome Statute and to respect the roles \r\nassigned to each entity under the Statute. Whereas the \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court can consider legislative \r\nissues and discuss political questions, the ICC must \r\nremain an independent judicial institution that relies on \r\nthe States for enforcement and cooperation.\r\nIn the words of the preamble to the Rome Statute, \r\nthe grave crimes under ICC jurisdiction “threaten the \r\npeace, security and well-being of the world”. It is not \r\ndifficult to see why. Mass murder, the use of armed \r\nforce against civilians, the deportation of populations, \r\nthe use of child soldiers, and rape used as a weapon of \r\nwar are atrocious acts that inflict irreparable suffering, \r\noften across generations. The issues that fall under the \r\nICC mandate have tremendous societal and political \r\nsignificance in the countries concerned. ICC decisions \r\nwill often be welcome to some and disappointing to \r\nothers, but the reasons driving the Court’s decisions are \r\nalways legal, not political.\r\nIn five years’ time, many ad hoc courts and tribunals \r\nwill have closed their doors. The role of the ICC in global \r\nefforts for peace, security and the prevention of mass \r\natrocities will be even more pronounced than it is today. \r\nLet us work together to further enhance that system. \r\nThe ICC can properly deliver its mandate only if States \r\ncooperate in accordance with the obligations they have \r\naccepted under the Rome Statute. I also appeal to those \r\nStates that have not yet joined the Statute to give active \r\nconsideration to doing so. Ultimately, the success of the \r\nICC in suppressing impunity depends upon the support \r\nof Member States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the observer of the European Union.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) \r\nand its member States. The candidate countries the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro \r\nand Serbia; the countries of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidates Albania \r\nand Bosnia and Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine and \r\nGeorgia, align themselves with this statement.\r\nAt the outset, we thank President Song for his \r\npresentation and the International Criminal Court \r\n13-53979 23/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nIt is essential that concerns about the ICC and its \r\nproceedings are presented within the framework of the \r\nRome Statute. Our common goal to further strengthen \r\nthe Court to fulfil its mandate is clear. There are \r\nStates parties to the ICC across all parts of the world, \r\nand they all share ownership of the Statute. We will \r\ncontinue to encourage the widest possible participation \r\nin the Rome Statute and are dedicated to preserving \r\nthe Statute’s integrity, supporting the independence of \r\nthe Court and ensuring cooperation with the Court. We \r\nare also committed to fully implementing the principle \r\nof complementarity enshrined in the Rome Statute by \r\nfacilitating effective and efficient interplay between \r\nnational justice systems and the ICC in the fight against \r\nimpunity.\r\nMr. Ronquist (Sweden): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the five Nordic countries: Denmark, \r\nFinland, Iceland, Norway and my own country, Sweden.\r\nLet me start by thanking the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its annual report to the United Nations \r\n(see A/68/314). I would also like to thank Judge Song, \r\nPresident of the ICC, personally, for providing a \r\nthorough presentation of the main issues in the report.\r\nThe Nordic countries would like to express their \r\nsincere appreciation to the Court for its significant \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity worldwide. \r\nFrom the report and President Song’s introduction, it is \r\nevident that the caseload of the Court has continued to \r\nincrease. In addition to the eight ongoing proceedings \r\nor investigations, the Office of the Prosecutor continued \r\nits preliminary examinations in Afghanistan, Colombia, \r\nGeorgia, Guinea, Honduras, the Republic of Korea and \r\nNigeria, and opened a preliminary examination on \r\nregistered vessels of the Union of the Comoros, Greece \r\nand the Kingdom of Cambodia. The activities of the \r\nCourt therefore reach worldwide.\r\nVictims’ issues are key for the Nordic countries, \r\nespecially regarding those suffering from sexual and \r\ngender-based crimes, as well as other vulnerable \r\npersons. We encourage States to contribute to the ICC \r\nTrust Fund for Victims. Increased resources for the \r\nFund will enable victims to truly enjoy their rights.\r\nThe Nordic countries warmly welcome Côte \r\nD’Ivoire as a new State party during the reporting \r\nperiod. The quest for universal adherence to and \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute continues and \r\nshould be intensified. We also stress the need for all \r\nStates parties, as well as non-State parties that have not \r\nif the Court is to be able to carry out its mandate. That \r\napplies to all States parties to the Rome Statue, as well \r\nas when the Security Council has referred a situation \r\nto the Court in accordance with Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nWe note with concern that arrest warrants issued \r\nby the Court — some dating back to 2005 — remain \r\noutstanding. A total of 13 persons are currently \r\nsubject to outstanding arrest warrants. We recall \r\nthat non-cooperation with the Court in respect of the \r\nexecution of arrest warrants constitutes a violation of \r\ninternational obligations and stif les the ICC’s capacity \r\nto deliver justice. We therefore call upon all States to \r\ntake consistent actions to encourage appropriate and \r\nfull cooperation with the Court, including the prompt \r\nexecution of arrest warrants. We also reiterate the \r\ncrucial importance for all States to refrain from helping \r\nto shelter or hide the perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes and to take the necessary steps to bring those \r\nperpetrators to justice in order to end impunity.\r\nWe note that on 11 October, Pre-Trial Chamber I of \r\nthe ICC decided that the case against Mr. Al-Senussi \r\nwas inadmissible before the Court, in accordance \r\nwith the principle of complementarity. The primary \r\nresponsibility for bringing offenders to justice lies \r\nwith States themselves, in conformity with the relevant \r\nprovisions of the Rome Statute. Complementarity is a \r\ncore principle of the Rome Statute; in order to make it \r\noperational, all States parties need to prepare and adopt \r\neffective national legislation to implement the Rome \r\nStatute in national systems.\r\nWe welcome the actions undertaken by States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society to increase \r\ntheir cooperation with and assistance to the ICC. We \r\nparticularly praise the ongoing cooperation of the \r\nUnited Nations with the Court, which is acknowledged \r\nin the report. We also welcome the guidance issued \r\nby the Secretary-General earlier this year on contacts \r\nwith persons who are the subject of arrest warrants or \r\nsummonses issued by the International Criminal Court \r\nand the practice of informing the Prosecutor and the \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute beforehand of any meetings with persons who \r\nare the subject of arrest warrants issued by the Court that \r\nare considered necessary for the performance of United \r\nNations-mandated tasks. The European Union and its \r\nmember States undertake, on their part, to pursue their \r\nefforts in the area of the fight against impunity, notably \r\nby giving the Court full diplomatic support.\r\n24/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\nissued by the International Criminal Court should \r\nbe limited to those which are strictly required for \r\ncarrying out essential United Nations mandated \r\nactivities.” (A/67/828, annex, p. 2)\r\nThe Nordic countries, as well as the European Union, \r\napply a similar contact policy. By mainstreaming our \r\nICC policy into regular bilateral diplomacy, we enhance \r\nthe reach and relevance of the Court.\r\nBeing independent does not mean that the Court \r\nstands alone. We are heartened by the detailed \r\ndescription in the report of multifold communication \r\nand interaction between the United Nations and the \r\nICC. Particularly, we welcome the first open debate \r\nin the Security Council on 17 October 2012 on peace \r\nand justice, with a special focus on the role of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (see S/PV.6849). We look \r\nforward to regular follow-up on the topic, in particular on \r\nhow the Council can lend stronger support to the Court \r\nin cases of non-cooperation with the ICC. The Security \r\nCouncil must do its part to ensure accountability when \r\ngross violations of international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights law have occurred.\r\nWe believe that the Court has delivered upon, if not \r\nexceeded, our high expectations of 15 years ago, when \r\nwe adopted the Rome Statute. The Court has become \r\nthe most important international actor in efforts to \r\nfight impunity and develop international criminal \r\nlaw. We recognize, however, that scepticism has been \r\nexpressed about the Court’s situations and indictments. \r\nThat concern is mainly raised by a number of African \r\nGovernments, questioning why the eight situations \r\ncurrently under the Court’s jurisdiction are all from \r\nAfrica. It is important, however, to bear in mind that \r\nalthough the current proceedings before the ICC \r\nconcern African situations, the largest numbers of such \r\nsituations have been referred to the Court by States \r\nthemselves. Furthermore, the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nis conducting preliminary examinations relating to \r\ncountries in all parts of the world. On that note, let me \r\nrefer to former Secretary-General Kofi Annan’s words \r\nin a speech this month in Cape Town:\r\n“Let me stress that it is the culture of impunity and \r\nindividuals who are on trial at the International \r\nCriminal Court, not Africa.”\r\nTo give a fair reflection of the perception of the \r\nICC in Africa, we should also recognize the general \r\nsupport of Governments, civil society and victims in \r\nAfrica, which remains strong. In that regard, the Nordic \r\nyet done, so to ratify and fully observe the Agreement \r\non the Privileges and Immunities of the ICC as a matter \r\nof priority.\r\nStates have the primary responsibility to investigate \r\nand prosecute crimes falling under ICC jurisdiction. The \r\nICC is a court of last resort. Ideally, it should have no \r\ncases. We must, however, acknowledge that many States \r\nlack the resources and capacity to exercise criminal law \r\nproceedings for such complex and large-scale crimes \r\nas genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \r\nThe Nordic countries are prepared to assist those States \r\nparties that are willing to enhance their national legal \r\ncapacities in that field.\r\nA substantial achievement for the cause of justice \r\nduring the reporting period was that Congolese war \r\ncrimes suspect, Bosco Ntaganda, became the first person \r\nsubject to an arrest warrant of the ICC to surrender \r\nhimself to the Court. It was also positive to see that the \r\nUnited States of America and Rwanda — two non-State \r\nparties — cooperated with the Court on the matter.\r\nDespite such successes, it is a cause for concern \r\nthat the number of outstanding arrest warrants remains \r\nhigh. Progress has to be made. States’ cooperation with \r\nthe Court, including the Office of the Prosecutor, must \r\nimprove. States parties have a legal obligation under \r\nthe Rome Statute to cooperate fully with the Court. \r\nTherefore, we urge all States parties to strengthen their \r\nefforts to execute the orders of the Court and to abstain \r\nfrom inviting and receiving suspects that are under an \r\narrest warrant of the ICC.\r\nAll States must also fully comply with their \r\nobligations under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand Security Council resolutions 1593 (2005) and 1970 \r\n(2011), concerning the situations in Darfur and in Libya. \r\nThe Government of the Sudan and all other parties to \r\nthe conflict in Darfur, as well as the Libyan authorities, \r\nrespectively, must cooperate fully with the Court and \r\nthe Prosecutor.\r\nIn addition to the execution of arrest warrants, \r\nthere are other ways for States and international \r\norganizations to engage in proactive measures that \r\nstrengthen the Court. The Nordic countries commend \r\nthe Secretary-General for his very clear guidelines, \r\nissued in April, on contacts with persons who are the \r\nsubject of arrest warrants or summonses issued by the \r\nICC. The guidelines provide that:\r\n“Contacts between United Nations officials and \r\npersons who are the subject of warrants of arrest \r\n13-53979 25/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nRomania continues to strongly support the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in accomplishing its \r\ncrucial role in the promotion of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level and in the fight against impunity \r\nfor the most serious crimes. We are pleased that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court is today not only a \r\ncommunity of States and ideals but a fully functioning \r\ninstitution.\r\nThe report reveals the progress in the judicial \r\nproceedings both in substance and in volume. We \r\ncommend the efforts of the Office of the Prosecutor, \r\nand we regard the new strategic plan released publicly \r\nthis month as an important step to increase the quality \r\nof its investigations and prosecutions. At the same time, \r\nwe acknowledge the growing caseload of the Court \r\nand we will carefully consider proposals to augment \r\nits resources in order to meet the needs of a highly \r\nperforming justice body. We congratulate Mr. Von \r\nHebel on his appointment as the new Registrar of the \r\nCourt, and we would like to assure him of Romania’s \r\nsupport as he undertakes his activities and efforts to \r\nachieve better coordination and coherence between the \r\ndifferent organs of the Court.\r\nThe International Criminal Court relies heavily \r\non the cooperation of the international community. \r\nAs a matter of fact, the Court will always rely on the \r\ncooperation of the States since there is no special \r\npolice authority available to it. From that perspective, \r\nStates should be aware of their important role in the \r\nrealization of the international judicial act and adopt \r\nmeasures to ensure full and prompt cooperation with \r\nthe Court, including with respect to the execution of the \r\noutstanding arrest warrants listed in the 2013 report, in \r\naccordance with the legal obligations stemming from \r\nthe Rome Statute and/or relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions.\r\nNon-cooperation is not only a violation of \r\ninternational obligations, but it also has the effect of \r\nundermining the efforts of the Court to deliver justice \r\nand ensure respect for the rule of law. It could also \r\naffect the Court’s credibility by failing to meet victims’ \r\nexpectations for justice. Therefore, an important \r\nresponsibility in seeing to the success of the Court \r\nlies with States parties, which must act consistently \r\nand persistently to support the Court’s activity and \r\npreserve its independence. At the same time, States \r\nparties should creatively join efforts in fostering the \r\nwillingness of third States to cooperate. In that respect, \r\ncountries welcome the Court’s intention to increase \r\nits presence in the field. In our view, that is crucial \r\nfor showing our commitment to the victims and the \r\nexecution of justice under the Rome Statute system. \r\nThe ICC must be an institution that is both visible and \r\naccessible to the people on the ground.\r\nAfrican countries were instrumental in the \r\nnegotiations of the Rome Statute that led to the \r\ncreation of the ICC. Today, the African continent is \r\nthe continent that boasts the highest number of States \r\nparties — 34 — to the Rome Statute. Africa’s present \r\nand future commitment to the ICC will remain critical \r\nto the global success of the Court and to its effectiveness \r\nand its legitimacy.\r\nAll me to take a step back to the drafting of the \r\nRome Statute and the main reason for which the ICC \r\nwas established. I would like to quote the second \r\npreambular paragraph of the Statute:\r\n“Mindful that during this century millions of \r\nchildren, women and men have been victims of \r\nunimaginable atrocities that deeply shock the \r\nconscience of humanity”.\r\nVictims of war crimes, crimes against humanity and \r\ngenocides, wherever they are found, deserve justice. \r\nBut we must do our best to encourage all States to live \r\nup to their obligations to investigate and prosecute. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court was created to take up the \r\ncases that States were not able or willing to take up. \r\nI am sure that we all aim for a world where the ICC \r\nhas become obsolete. But in today’s reality, an effective \r\nand independent ICC is needed and should be fully \r\nsupported by all States.\r\nLet me conclude by renewing our pledge that the \r\nNordic countries will remain principal supporters of \r\nthe ICC. We are committed to continue working for the \r\nCourt’s effectiveness, professionalism, independence \r\nand integrity.\r\nMs. Orosan (Romania): I would like to start my \r\nintervention by thanking President Song for the ninth \r\nannual report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(see A/68/314), submitted to the United Nations in \r\naccordance with article 6 of the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court. At the outset, I would like stress that \r\nwe fully subscribe to the statement delivered on behalf \r\nof the European Union.\r\n26/27 13-53979\r\nA/68/PV.41 31/10/2013\r\ncriminal jurisdiction that is impartial, non-selective, \r\nefficient, just and complementary to national systems \r\nof justice, truly independent and therefore exempt from \r\nsubordination to political interests that might strip it of \r\nits essence. \r\nCuba notes with concern that certain events of the \r\npast year highlight ongoing problems with the lack of \r\nautonomy of the International Criminal Court as a result \r\nof the provisions set forth in article 16 of the Rome \r\nStatute and the broad powers granted to the Security \r\nCouncil with regard to the Court’s work. Beyond \r\nstripping the Court of its jurisdiction, this issue violates \r\nthe principle of independence of legal bodies, as well \r\nas transparency and impartiality in the administration \r\nof justice. Unfortunately, problems concerning this \r\nmatter were not resolved in the outcome of the Review \r\nConference on the Rome Statute held in Kampala from \r\n31 May to 11 June 2010, and the Court, as a body of \r\ninternational criminal jurisdiction, remains bound by \r\ndecisions of other bodies.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba reiterates that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court should not ignore \r\ninternational treaties and the principles of international \r\nlaw. The Court should respect the principle of law \r\nrelative to the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty, \r\nas set forth in article 11 of the Vienna Convention on \r\nthe Law of Treaties. Cuba reiterates its serious concern \r\nover the precedent set by the decisions of the Court in \r\nwhich it initiated judicial proceedings against nationals \r\nof States that are not party to the Rome Statute and \r\nthat have not accepted its jurisdiction in accordance \r\nwith article 12 of the Statute. We must not lose sight \r\nof the fact that the jurisdiction of the ICC should be \r\nkept independent of the political bodies of the United \r\nNations and always work in a complementary manner \r\nto national criminal jurisdictions.\r\nThe people of Cuba have been victims of the most \r\ndiverse forms of aggression for 50 years. As a result \r\nof the various types of aggression against our country, \r\nwe have suffered the deaths of thousands of Cubans, \r\nwith hundreds of families losing their children, parents \r\nand siblings, in addition to untold economic, financial \r\nand material losses. However, the definition of the \r\ncrime of aggression reached in the Review Conference \r\nin Kampala in no way includes such violations in that \r\ncategory of crime.\r\nThe definition of the crime of aggression should be \r\nestablished along generic lines to include all forms of \r\nthe dialogue between the ICC and the United Nations \r\nshould also be enhanced.\r\nWe welcome Côte d’Ivoire’s joining the Rome \r\nStatute in February as its 122nd party. We strongly \r\nconsider that the quest for universality should continue \r\nand, in that respect, we encourage all States that \r\nhave not yet done so to become parties to the Rome \r\nStatute. It is also our belief that strengthening the \r\nICC by achieving its universality is the most powerful \r\npreventive approach, reducing the risk of impunity \r\nand ensuring the compliance with the most important \r\nnorms of international law.\r\nRomania, as a focal point for achieving universality \r\nof the Rome Statute, makes every effort to assist parties \r\nin joining the Rome Statute and will remain engaged in \r\nthose efforts even beyond that capacity. Throughout the \r\nreporting period, Romania organized a series of events \r\nin Bucharest and New York. The event we organized \r\nthis summer in New York, in collaboration with the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, was \r\nattended by officials from the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nof the ICC. The most recent event that we organized \r\nas focal point was a regional conference that took \r\nplace in Bucharest on 17 October. The conference \r\nwas dedicated to three key areas relating to the Rome \r\nStatute and the International Criminal Court, namely, \r\nuniversality, the Kampala Amendments and the issue \r\nof cooperation with the International Criminal Court. \r\nPresident Song and the President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, Ambassador Intelmann, were keynote \r\nspeakers at the event, and I would like to thank them \r\nagain for accepting our invitation and for their tireless \r\nefforts within and beyond the ICC.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Romania’s \r\nfull support to the International Criminal Court and by \r\nendorsing the conclusion of the report on the need for \r\nstrong, consistent and continuous support for the ICC \r\nfrom States and the international community, support \r\nthat would permit that unique international body to \r\nfulfil the mandate we have entrusted to it.\r\nMr. Pírez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Cuban delegation takes note of the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) (see A/68/314) and \r\nwishes to express before the plenary once again its \r\ncommitment to fighting impunity against crimes that \r\naffect the international community.\r\nMy delegation believes that the fight against \r\nimpunity should be based on the establishment of a \r\n13-53979 27/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.41\r\nindependence and impartiality, and the unrestricted \r\napplication of and respect for international law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this agenda item \r\nfor this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\naggression that arise in international relations between \r\nStates and that affect sovereignty, territorial integrity \r\nand political independence of States. It should not be \r\nlimited to the use of armed force. Our country reaffirms \r\nits resolve to fight against impunity and upholds its \r\ncommitment to international criminal justice and \r\nits attachment to the principles of transparency, \r\n"
