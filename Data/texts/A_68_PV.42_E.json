"In the absence of the President, Ms. Picco (Monaco), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 75 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (see A/68/314)\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/68/364  \r\nand A/68/366)\r\nMr. Estremé (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina expresses its appreciation and recognition \r\nof the President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song, for presenting the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (see A/68/314) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We also particularly acknowledge \r\nthe presentation of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, which contains information relevant to \r\nthe implementation of article 3 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (A/68/364), as requested \r\nby the General Assembly in resolution 67/295.\r\nThe Rome Statute and the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) are among the most notable achievements \r\nof multilateral diplomacy, and their contribution to the \r\nfight against impunity with regard to crimes against \r\nhumanity, genocide and war crimes is evident. Little \r\nmore than a decade since the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute, the Court is a fully functioning permanent \r\ninternational criminal tribunal. Argentina commends \r\nthe fact that there are to date 122 States parties to the \r\nRome Statute, and 11 States have ratified the Kampala \r\namendments.\r\nThe other issue that I would like to highlight \r\nconcerns the crime of aggression. My country, like \r\nmany other States parties, is committed to the earliest \r\npossible ratification of the Kampala amendments. \r\nDespite the great difficulty of having a substantive \r\nreference to the crime of aggression in the Assembly \r\nresolution, owing to the strong opposition of a small \r\nhandful of delegations, Argentina will continue to work \r\ntowards achieving 30 ratifications before 2017 so as to \r\nbe able to establish the Court’s jurisdiction in that way, \r\nas foreseen in Kampala.\r\nWith the passing of time since the entry into force \r\nof the Rome Statute, the necessary accountability \r\nfor crimes under the Statute has become integrated \r\nin a tangible way into the deliberations of the United \r\nNations and of the entire international community. The \r\nSecurity Council has done so, integrating the Court \r\nitself in its consideration of specific situations. All that \r\nhas strengthened the fight against impunity. However, \r\nthere remain challenges that must be overcome.\r\nMutual cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Court is crucial, with full respect \r\nfor the Court’s judicial independence. The issue of \r\nnon-essential contacts with persons upon whom arrest \r\nwarrants have been served falls under the cooperation \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations provided \r\nfor in the Relationship Agreement. Argentina thanks \r\nthe Secretary-General for having included such \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.42\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n42nd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 31 October 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

However, that \r\nobjective must go hand in hand with the commitment to \r\nprovide the Court with the resources necessary for it to \r\ndischarge its mandate.\r\nThat commitment is not foreign to the United \r\nNations, given that it has been evident with respect \r\nto the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security \r\nCouncil. It must now be addressed with respect to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. The lack of any action \r\nwith regard to the funding to be provided by the United \r\nNations under article 115 of the Rome Statute will \r\nonly negatively impact those cases currently before the \r\nCourt and the proprio motu work of the Prosecutor.\r\nIn 2012, 10 years had elapsed since the establishment \r\nof the International Criminal Court. Today, the Court is \r\na permanent and fully mature tribunal, the centre of the \r\ncriminal justice system of the international community. \r\nHowever, we States parties face challenges. The issues \r\nraised by the African Union are central to the current \r\ndebate concerning the International Criminal Court. \r\nArgentina believes that we must continue a frank \r\ndialogue among all actors regarding such issues and \r\nconcerns, with care not to impinge on the judicial \r\nindependence of the Court.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to state once again that \r\nArgentina believes that the International Criminal Court \r\nis one of the most notable contributions to the fight \r\nagainst impunity. I wish to recall that one of our stated \r\naims is to ensure the noble mission and the function \r\nof the International Criminal Court in a multilateral \r\nsystem that seeks to end impunity, to establish the rule \r\nof law, to promote and support respect of human rights \r\nand to achieve a lasting peace, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. I would like to reiterate \r\nthat the Argentine Republic is fully committed to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): This year’s \r\ndebate on the report (see A/68/314) of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) comes at a time when the Court \r\nfinds itself in the headlines more frequently than any \r\nof us could have imagined at the Rome Conference \r\n15 years ago. Some of the Court’s activities are evoking \r\nstrong reactions, particularly in Africa, where the \r\nCourt has been most active so far. The challenge for us, \r\ncollectively, is to address those political challenges in a \r\ninformation in his report (A/68/364). Essentially, \r\nhowever, it is the cooperation of States with the Court \r\nthat is the fundamental aspect of the Court’s ability to \r\ndischarge its mandate. The requirement to cooperate is \r\nparticularly relevant to arrest warrants.\r\nWith regard to referrals made by the Security \r\nCouncil, Argentina understands that the Council cannot \r\njust take note of the reports of the Prosecutor or of the \r\nCourt without following up on compliance with the \r\nrequirement to cooperate with the Court, or on certain \r\nsituations in the field such as the detention of Court \r\npersonnel in 2012.\r\nArgentina, which is currently a member of the \r\nSecurity Council, welcomes the commitment made by \r\nthe Council in presidential statement S/PRST/2013/2 of \r\n12 February 2013, to an effective follow-up of Council \r\ndecisions with regard to international tribunals, \r\nincluding the ICC. We therefore urge Council members \r\nto make that commitment effective through a specific \r\nfollow-up mechanism for the situations that the Council \r\nhas referred to the Court.\r\nThere are other elements about which my delegation \r\nis concerned. However, I would like to highlight one \r\naspect relating to the way in which the Council has \r\nmade referrals to the ICC and the way in which the \r\nGeneral Assembly deals with that. It involves an issue \r\nthat can seriously impact the Court.\r\nIn establishing that none of the costs stemming from \r\nthe two referrals to the Court would be met by the United \r\nNations but by the States parties to the Rome Statute, \r\nthe Council has distanced itself from the provision of \r\narticle 115 (b) of the Rome Statute and article 13 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement. With the increasing number \r\nof cases, the pressures on the resources available to the \r\nCourt have been acknowledged. In practical terms, not \r\nto consider the funding of referrals could jeopardize the \r\nCourt’s long-term viability.\r\nResolution 67/295, adopted in August, acknowledged, \r\nas the resolution to that effect does every year, the need \r\nfor funding for the investigations and judgements of \r\nthe Court, including for the situations referred by the \r\nSecurity Council. The resolution, however, makes no \r\nmention of the way in which the funding should be \r\nprovided for, in particular with regard to referrals by \r\nthe Council. That was owing to the opposition of a very \r\nfew delegations, despite the fact that it concerns a norm \r\nof the Rome Statute and the Relationship Agreement, as \r\nI have just pointed out.\r\n13-54081 3/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nimportant measure in that respect. Recent experience \r\nalso illustrates that we must put greater emphasis on \r\nensuring witness protection. That is an urgent task \r\nand of essential importance for the effectiveness of \r\nthe Court. Much can be learned from the experience of \r\nother international and mixed tribunals in that regard.\r\nFinally, we must also ensure that we equip the \r\nCourt with the financial resources it needs to fulfil its \r\nmandate successfully. Otherwise, budget constraints \r\ncould hamper the quality of ongoing activities and \r\nprevent the Court from opening new investigations, \r\nas the Prosecutor has warned. We also must also find \r\na sustainable solution for the financing of Security \r\nCouncil referrals, in accordance with the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the Court.\r\nWe welcome the increased collaboration between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC. We commend the \r\nSecretary-General for issuing thoughtful guidance \r\non limiting contacts with persons who are the subject \r\nof arrest warrants or summonses. It is essential that \r\nthose guidelines are implemented consistently and \r\nthat their implementation continue to be monitored \r\nby the Secretary-General’s office. We welcome the \r\nefforts of certain high-level United Nations officials \r\nto communicate essential contacts with persons who \r\nare the subject of arrest warrants well in advance. At \r\nthe same time, we believe that it is important that all \r\nUnited Nations personnel not engage with indictees on \r\ntheir own authority. We hope that States that have not \r\nyet done so will develop their own policies on limiting \r\ncontacts with fugitives, based on those principles.\r\nA significant advance in the relationship between \r\nthe Court and the United Nations was the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2100 (2013). That decision \r\nmandated the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali to support \r\nefforts to execute ICC arrest warrants related to \r\ncrimes committed in that country. That could serve as \r\na blueprint for other situations as well, in particular \r\nthose referred to the ICC by the Council itself. That \r\npositive step, however, cannot mask the fact that, \r\noverall, the manner in which the Council deals with the \r\nCourt remains problematic. Greater consistency by the \r\nCouncil and, most of all, more credible follow-up on its \r\nown referral decisions would be in the interest of both \r\nthe Council and the Court.\r\nThe recent events in Syria have reminded us of \r\nthe importance of the Kampala amendments to the \r\nmanner that is fully consistent with the law contained \r\nin the Rome Statute. We are satisfied to see that the \r\nnecessary dialogue has commenced and look forward \r\nto continuing it, particularly among States parties.\r\nThe Rome Statute system has put accountability for \r\nthe most serious crimes within the reach of conflict and \r\npost-conflict societies. That is a profound paradigm \r\nshift following decades of impunity in many parts of \r\nthe world, a shift made possible by the strong political \r\nwill of the States that gathered in Rome. They did so \r\nnot because they thought that fighting impunity would \r\nbe an easy thing to do, but because it was the right \r\nthing to do. Today, as we discuss the work of the Court, \r\nwe should remember the spirit of Rome. We should be \r\nready for constructive dialogue with the critics, but also \r\nready to stand up for our principles.\r\nLooking at the Court’s judicial record, we believe \r\nthat it has been doing precisely what we have asked it \r\nto do: investigate and prosecute those who are alleged \r\nto bear the greatest responsibility for crimes under \r\nthe Rome Statute, follow the evidence and apply the \r\nlaw. Nevertheless, the Court has been subject to much \r\ncriticism. Such criticism is in reality often directed \r\nagainst the Security Council, which has referred two \r\ncases to the ICC and thereby extended its jurisdiction \r\nover non-States parties. We do not find any evidence \r\nthat the decisions of the Court itself are in any manner \r\nmotivated by politics rather than the law.\r\nIn order to counteract misconceptions and \r\npolitically motivated criticism, all States that believe \r\nin justice should strengthen their support for the Court, \r\ndiplomatically, politically, financially. We must show \r\ngreater ownership over the system we have established \r\nand continue to improve it from within. In that regard, I \r\nwould like to draw the Assembly’s attention to a recent \r\ninitiative by Botswana, Jordan and Liechtenstein that \r\nwould add a provision to the Court’s rules of procedure \r\nand evidence. The proposal addresses the important \r\nissue of presence at trial and the possibility of presence \r\nvia videoconferencing, if exceptional circumstances \r\nso require. We hope that the initiative can be one \r\nsignificant part of a more comprehensive response to \r\nthe recent controversies. Most importantly, it would \r\nillustrate the willingness of States parties to do their \r\npart to assist the Court at a difficult time.\r\nStates parties should also make every effort to ensure \r\nthe highest possible quality of judges. Nominating \r\nthe most qualified judicial candidates is the most \r\n4/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nthe light of the evolving situations in some African \r\ncountries. It is highly regrettable that its repeated \r\nrequests regarding certain cases have not been acted \r\nupon by the International Criminal Court, the Security \r\nCouncil or the Assembly of States Parties.\r\nMoreover, in September, Eritrea, along with other \r\nAfrican States, filed an amicus curiae observation \r\nto the Appeals Chamber that elaborates on how a \r\ncooperating individual who concurrently occupies a \r\nhigh Government office should be handled in order \r\nto encourage State cooperation without endangering \r\nthat office-holder’s constitutional rights. Eritrea, \r\nas a non-State party to the ICC, willingly joined the \r\nobservation with information that could help the court \r\napply the law impartially.\r\nThe unacceptable treatment of African States and \r\ntheir leaders by the ICC is aggravating the current \r\nsituation rather than addressing the root cause of the \r\nproblem. The present challenge concerns not only the \r\nfuture management of international criminal justice, \r\nincluding cases of impunity and violence in the world, \r\nbut also the way in which States relate to each other in \r\nthe context of the international justice system.\r\nChallenges are better addressed through a candid \r\nand realistic exchange of views, based on full respect \r\nfor the rule of law within the family of nations. We hope \r\nwe will be able to act in a manner that reflects a deep \r\nunderstanding of the complexities of nation-building \r\nas revealed by several African cases and the African \r\nUnion discussions on the ICC.\r\nIn that context, let me add the voice of Eritrea in \r\nurging the General Assembly to work for comprehensive \r\nreform of multilateral institutions, including the \r\nSecurity Council and the ICC. Our collective efforts \r\nfor justice, equality and fairness must continue to be \r\nconsolidated.\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress that the notion of \r\nan effective multilateral system can be achieved only if \r\nit is based on unambiguous and transparent rules that \r\napply to all players without selectivity, politicization \r\nor double standards, in order to build an enduring \r\nrelationship based on a shared commitment to peace, \r\nsecurity, justice and opportunity.\r\nMr. Rowe (Australia): Australia would like to \r\nthank President Song for his report (see A/68/314).\r\nAustralia is both shocked and appalled that today, \r\nsome 70 years after the Second World War, and \r\nRome Statute adopted in 2010. At the Kampala Review \r\nConference, we added provisions that criminalize the \r\nuse of poisonous and other gases no matter whether \r\nthey are used in international or in non-international \r\narmed conflict.\r\nBut the biggest step forward made in Kampala \r\nare the amendments on the crime of aggression. They \r\ncomplement the prohibition of the illegal use of force \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nmost serious forms of the illegal use of force by one \r\nState against another will become a punishable offence \r\nbefore the Court. The ICC will thereby help enforce \r\nthe core principle of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel.\r\nWith the recent ratifications by Andorra, Cyprus, \r\nSlovenia and Uruguay, we have come an important \r\nstep closer to the activation of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression in the year 2017. We \r\nwill continue to offer assistance to States that are \r\ninterested in ratifying and implementing the Kampala \r\namendments, and we will encourage States that are \r\ninterested in joining the ICC to ratify the Rome Statute \r\nin its 2010 version.\r\nMr. Giorgio (Eritrea): My delegation takes note of \r\nthe report (see A/68/614) of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) and would like to offer some comments on \r\nagenda item 75.\r\nEritrea firmly believes in an international order \r\nwell grounded in full respect for the rule of law. Eritrea \r\nis a signatory to the Rome Statute and signed it in good \r\nfaith. Although not a State party, Eritrea is seriously \r\nconcerned about the development of ICC activities. The \r\ncurrent state of implementation does not seem to do \r\nwhat was envisaged at the entry into force of the Rome \r\nStatute on 1 July 2002.\r\nEritrea shares the same concerns raised by African \r\nHeads of State and Government during the recent \r\nExtraordinary Session of the African Union Executive \r\nCouncil, held in Addis Ababa, with the theme of Africa’s \r\nrelationship with the International Criminal Court.\r\nIndeed, over the past years, instead of serving \r\njustice and fairness, more consideration has been \r\ngiven to politics. Unless adequately and immediately \r\nredressed, that approach will further undermine the \r\nentire international criminal justice system.\r\nThe African Union has intensively discussed its \r\nrelationship with the International Criminal Court in \r\n13-54081 5/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nforward, and also look forward to discussions on this \r\nissue at the upcoming meeting of the ICC Assembly of \r\nStates Parties.\r\nWhile solutions are being discussed, it is important \r\nto recall that all States must fulfil their obligations \r\nunder international law, whether such obligations \r\nderive from being a party to the Rome Statute or from \r\nresolutions of the Security Council.\r\nWe also take this opportunity to underscore our \r\nview that it is imperative that the Security Council \r\nprovide ongoing support to the ICC, especially in \r\nrelation to situations it has referred to the Court. At \r\nthe same time, we wish to welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s guidance to the Secretariat on contact with \r\npersons subject to arrest warrants. We call on the \r\nUnited Nations to implement that policy strictly.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was born out of \r\nthe international community’s collective commitment \r\nto hold those accused of serious international crimes to \r\naccount and to bring at least a measure of justice to the \r\nvictims of those crimes. That is a goal that we surely \r\nall share. Australia, for its part, remains committed \r\nto working with all States to ensure that we turn that \r\naspiration into a reality.\r\nMr. Diener Sala (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico would like to thank Judge Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, for his \r\npresentation of the Court’s ninth annual report (see \r\nA/68/314) to the General Assembly. We welcome \r\nMr. Herman von Hebel as Registrar of the Court and \r\nMr. James Stewart as Deputy Prosecutor, both of whom \r\nhave been in their positions since the start of 2013. We \r\nwish them every success as they proceed to discharge \r\ntheir responsibilities.\r\nMexico welcomes Côte d’Ivoire’s adherence to the \r\nRome Statute during the reporting period, which brings \r\nthe number of States parties to 122. We reiterate our \r\nenergetic call on those States that have not yet done \r\nso to adhere to the Rome Statute without delay. The \r\nearliest possible universalization of that important \r\ninstrument is a goal of which we must not lose sight \r\nin our common effort to combat impunity for the most \r\nheinous crimes in the world.\r\nThe report presented today demonstrates the \r\nreal progress made in the judicial activities and \r\ninvestigations of the Court. The period under review \r\nincludes, among other things, the first voluntary \r\n20 years after the tragedies in the former Yugoslavia \r\nand Rwanda, serious international crimes are \r\ncontinuing to be committed, and committed on an \r\nalarming scale. Every day we are presented with fresh \r\nevidence that children, women and men have been the \r\nvictims of unimaginable atrocities that deeply shock \r\nthe conscience of humankind. All too often such crimes \r\nare neither investigated nor prosecuted, which sends a \r\ndangerous message to would-be perpetrators that their \r\nacts will be tolerated.\r\nIt was in response to such concerns that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) was established. \r\nStates have the primary responsibility to prosecute \r\nserious international crimes committed on their \r\nterritory or by their nationals. However, as a court \r\nof last resort, the ICC has a critical role to play in \r\nadvancing the international community’s fight against \r\nimpunity. That is why Australia is, and will remain, an \r\nunflinching supporter of the ICC, and why we will do \r\neverything in our power to help achieve the aims and \r\nobjectives of the Rome Statute.\r\nWe commend all organs of the Court on the \r\ncontribution they have made so far to the establishment \r\nof the Court as a significant part of the international \r\narchitecture. The international community can take \r\ngreat pride in the progress that has been made since \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute. In particular, we \r\nwelcome the surrender this year of Bosco Ntaganda \r\nand the ratifications by a growing number of States of \r\namendments on war crimes and the crime of aggression.\r\nWe also welcome the ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute this year by Côte d’Ivoire and the progress \r\nbeing made towards universalization of the Statute, on \r\nwhich Australia is actively working, including in the \r\nPacific region. We encourage States that have not yet \r\ndone so to ratify the Rome Statute and to join Australia \r\nand the parties to the Statute in seeking justice for the \r\nvictims of serious international crimes.\r\nIn providing our unwavering support to the Court, \r\nwe acknowledge the concerns raised regarding the \r\nICC’s approach to a number of matters, including \r\nconcerns raised by the African Union in relation to \r\nthe cases against Kenya’s President Kenyatta and \r\nDeputy President Ruto. Australia has welcomed the \r\nopportunity to engage in an exchange of views with the \r\nAfrican Union and with Kenya. We are ready to listen \r\nclosely to those concerns. We are also confident that we \r\nwill be able to work together to find a constructive way \r\n6/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\ncooperation from both the States and other States. In \r\nsome cases the Court notified the Security Council of \r\nthe lack of cooperation. There is an urgent need for the \r\nSecurity Council to immediately follow up on situations \r\nreferred to the Court so as to promote cooperation \r\nbetween States and the Court. We welcome the open \r\ndebate held by the Security Council in October 2012 \r\non the role of the Court (see S/PV.6849), and we urge \r\nthe Council to continue with initiatives that promote \r\nthe strengthening of the relationship between the two \r\nbodies.\r\nThirdly, Mexico would like to recall one \r\nfundamental issue that must be dealt with if the Court is \r\nto be strengthened, namely, the allocation of adequate \r\nresources so that it can carry out its work effectively. \r\nIn that regard, we urge the General Assembly, in \r\naccordance with its powers, to implement the provisions \r\nof article 115 of the Rome Statute in order to allocate \r\nsufficient funds to finance the Court’s expenditures \r\noccurring in situations referred to it by the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nFinally, given the violations currently being \r\ncommitted in various parts of the world, Mexico \r\nwould stress that the Security Council must be guided \r\nby objective criteria and not by politicized criteria, \r\nin referring situations to the International Criminal \r\nCourt. In that way the international community can \r\nhelp to ensure that international crimes do not remain \r\nunpunished.\r\nMexico reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and stands ready to work \r\ntowards the common goal of combatting impunity for \r\ninternational crimes, both within the United Nations \r\nand in other relevant forums.\r\nMs. Intelmann (Estonia): Estonia aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. The present statement is delivered in my \r\ncapacity as President of the Assembly of States Parties \r\nto the Rome Statute and as Estonia’s Ambassador-at-\r\nlarge for the International Criminal Court.\r\nThe report of the Court (see A/68/314) demonstrates \r\nhow the Court is working to meet the challenging \r\nmandate that States gave to it under the Rome Statute. \r\nThere are now eight active situations under the Court’s \r\nconsideration, a considerable number of which were \r\nreferred by the States concerned. During the past year, \r\ntwo more countries referred their situations to the \r\nsurrender by a person subject to an arrest warrant of \r\nthe Court, more extensive judicial activity by the Court \r\nregarding participation by victims and reparations, \r\nand the launching of an investigation into a situation \r\nreferred by a State in 2012. That, together with legal \r\ndevelopments in the various situations that the Court \r\nhas been examining, shows not only the progressive \r\nconsolidation of international criminal jurisprudence, \r\nbut also the growing credibility and trust in the system \r\nset up by the Rome Statute. Despite the undeniable \r\nprogress, fundamental challenges remain to be solved \r\nbefore the Court can effectively discharge its mandate, \r\nand we believe that the United Nations makes a positive \r\ncontribution to that end as well.\r\nFirst, we agree with the President of the Court that \r\nthere is a need for the firm and constant support of the \r\ninternational community. Mexico is and always has \r\nbeen an active supporter of the Court, and it reaffirms \r\nits continued support to the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the objectives for which it was created. \r\nWe underscore the relevance and value of the Court \r\nas an independent permanent judicial body to combat \r\nimpunity in respect of the most egregious crimes at the \r\ninternational level, when the State involved is unwilling \r\nor unable to actually take action.\r\nWe commend the ongoing dialogue and collaboration \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Court, and we urge \r\nthe United Nations to continue that work. In the same \r\nregard, we commend the President of the Court and its \r\nother organs for participating in the special session on \r\ninternational criminal law, a meeting held in April at \r\nthe Organization of American States, on the basis of \r\na resolution which Mexico submits biannually to that \r\norganization.\r\nSecondly, my delegation wishes to stress the \r\ncritical importance of the cooperation of States in \r\nexecuting arrest warrants and detention orders issued \r\nby the Court. Mexico deplores the lack of cooperation, \r\nsometimes open and explicit, exhibited by some \r\nStates. That affects the effectiveness of the system and \r\nperpetuates impunity for serious crimes. We welcome \r\nthe adoption of the United Nations revised policy on \r\nnon-essential contacts with persons subject to arrest \r\nwarrants from the Court. We urge the United Nations \r\nto implement its policy strictly in order to help promote \r\ncooperation with the Court.\r\nThe report shows that the two situations referred \r\nby the Security Council to the Court faced a lack of \r\n13-54081 7/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nof the Assembly of States Parties in order to strengthen \r\nour work to ensure accountability for the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community as a \r\nwhole.\r\nMr. Zack (United States of America): We would \r\nlike to thank President Song of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for his presentation of the ninth \r\nannual report of the ICC to the General Assembly \r\n(see A/68/314), covering the period from 1 August \r\n2012 to 31 July 2013. We recognize President Song for \r\nhis continued service to the ICC.\r\nStrengthening accountability for those responsible \r\nfor the worst atrocities remains an important priority \r\nfor the United States. President Obama has repeatedly \r\nemphasized the importance of preventing mass \r\natrocities and genocide as a core national security \r\ninterest and a core moral responsibility for the United \r\nStates. The United States is committed to working \r\nwith the international community to bring concerted \r\ninternational pressure to bear, so as to prevent atrocities \r\nand ensure accountability for the perpetrators of such \r\ncrimes. Although the United States is not a party to \r\nthe Rome Statute, we recognize that the ICC can and \r\ndoes play an important role in a multilateral system that \r\nseeks to ensure accountability and end impunity.\r\nThe ICC is, by its nature, designed only to pursue \r\nthose accused of bearing the greatest responsibility for \r\nthe most serious crimes within its jurisdiction, when \r\nStates are not willing or able to genuinely investigate \r\nor prosecute. We therefore continue to support positive \r\ncomplementarity initiatives by assisting countries \r\nin their efforts to develop domestic accountability \r\nprocesses for atrocity crimes. Accountability and peace \r\nbegin with Governments taking care of their own \r\npeople.\r\nThe international community must continue to \r\nsupport rule-of-law capacity-building initiatives, \r\nincluding the creation of hybrid structures where \r\nappropriate, in order to advance transitional justice, \r\nand it must develop a shared approach to recurring \r\nissues, such as coordinated and effective protection for \r\nwitnesses and judicial personnel. From the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo to Senegal’s efforts with the \r\nAfrican Union to prosecute Hissène Habré, the United \r\nStates continues to support efforts to build fair, \r\nimpartial and capable national justice systems and \r\nhybrid tribunals where appropriate.\r\nCourt, thereby expressing confidence in that judicial \r\ninstitution.\r\nThe growing membership of States parties to the \r\nStatute further demonstrates that confidence. Over the \r\npast years, we have witnessed a steady increase in the \r\nnumber of States parties. The number now stands at \r\n122. Eleven States have ratified both amendments to the \r\nRome Statute, which were adopted at the Assembly’s \r\nreview conference in Kampala in 2010. Three more \r\nStates have ratified one amendment to the Statute.\r\nStates are responsible for the Rome Statute system. \r\nStates negotiated the Rome Statute, and States are \r\nresponsible for the Court’s success and development. \r\nStates within the Assembly have been working \r\ncollectively throughout the past year to reinforce their \r\nsupport to the Court in critical areas like cooperation \r\nand assistance to victims. Some of those activities \r\nhave taken place outside the two traditional places \r\nwhere Assembly members work — The Hague and \r\nNew York — in various capitals, where they advocate \r\nfor reinforced assistance and to conduct very focused \r\ndiscussions with policy makers.\r\nThe Assembly holds one annual session this year \r\nin The Hague starting on 20 November. It is crucial \r\nthat all parties to the Statute participate in the meeting, \r\nas the Court and the Rome Statute have come under \r\nincreased scrutiny in different forums. The coming \r\nsession will be a critical moment to demonstrate \r\nour resolve to fight impunity. The annual Assembly \r\nsession provides an excellent opportunity for a political \r\ndiscussion on all matters of concern to States Parties. \r\nOne such opportunity is the general debate. This year \r\nStates are also encouraged to speak on the subject of \r\ncomplementarity — to provide information about their \r\nefforts to create genuine domestic infrastructures for \r\naccountability for atrocity crimes.\r\nAdditionally, given that all of the active situations \r\nare on the African continent, the coming Assembly \r\nsession will, at the request of African States, allocate \r\na special segment to discussing some of the concerns \r\nvoiced by African States parties. I have also invited \r\na high-level representative of the African Union to \r\naddress the opening plenary of the Assembly.\r\nAs we prepare for the upcoming Assembly session, \r\nwe must also bear in mind the victims of atrocity \r\ncrimes. That includes assistance and reparations, as \r\nprovided under the Statute. States are encouraged to \r\nattend and actively participate in the annual meeting \r\n8/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nd’être. The independence of such an important judicial \r\ninstitution and the universality of its reach provide the \r\nfoundation for its legitimacy, and legitimacy is perhaps \r\nthe single most important basis for bringing accused \r\npersons to justice with fairness and full respect for their \r\nrights.\r\nTherefore, Brazil is a staunch supporter of \r\nCourt’s universality. Two thirds of the United Nations \r\nmembership have ratified the Rome Statute, but that \r\ndoes not make it universal. We need to ensure further \r\nprogress towards the adherence of all Member States. \r\nEnhancing the Court’s legitimacy through universality \r\nis a means to promote peace and justice. In that context, \r\nI am pleased to recall that all South American countries \r\nare parties to the Rome Statute.\r\nLet me underscore the importance that we attach \r\nto the first Review Conference of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich took place in Kampala in 2010 and in which \r\nBrazil was an active participant. The activation of the \r\nKampala amendments, in 2017, will represent a major \r\ncontribution to completing the international criminal \r\njustice system adopted in Rome in 1998.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that the Court has also \r\nissued its first judgement, in the Lubanga case, while \r\nnoting that its workload is increasing, including through \r\nterritorial State referrals — or self-referrals — by a \r\nnumber of countries. On the other hand, Brazil has \r\nspoken out about issues of a structural nature that go to \r\nthe heart of the relationship between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFirst of all, we reiterate that the prerogative of the \r\nSecurity Council to refer cases to the ICC must be used \r\nwith caution and only after other tools have proved \r\nto be inadequate or insufficient and after thorough \r\nconsideration has been given to its repercussions for \r\nthe prospects of peace and reconciliation. Moreover, \r\nthe Council must be rigorous and take a principled \r\napproach when pursuing the referral track, avoiding \r\ndouble standards and selectivity. However, we regret \r\nthat the two referrals thus far have been stained with \r\nthe notion of selective criminal accountability, by \r\nwhich certain categories of individuals are exempted \r\nfrom ICC jurisdiction.\r\nAlso, the acknowledgement of the importance of \r\narticle 13 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the ICC on the conditions under \r\nwhich funds may be provided to the Court when it incurs \r\nexpenses as the result of Security Council referrals \r\nAt the same time, we must strengthen accountability \r\nmechanisms at the international level. We will continue \r\nto work with the ICC to identify practical ways in which \r\nwe can work to advance our mutual goals on a case-by-\r\ncase basis and consistent with United States policy and \r\nlaws. In the past year, for example, we worked with the \r\nCourt and other States to help assist in the voluntary \r\nsurrender to the ICC in March of Bosco Ntaganda, \r\nallegedly responsible for atrocities committed in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo. That was an \r\nimportant moment for all who believe in justice and \r\naccountability.\r\nIn January, President Obama signed into law an \r\nexpansion of the United States War Crimes Rewards \r\nProgram to permit the offer of rewards for information \r\nleading to the arrest, transfer or conviction of individuals \r\naccused of criminal responsibility for genocide, war \r\ncrimes or crimes against humanity by any hybrid or \r\ninternational criminal tribunal, including the ICC. \r\nShortly thereafter, we added a number of individuals \r\nsubject to ICC arrest warrants to our rewards list, \r\nincluding Joseph Kony in the Uganda situation and \r\nSylvestre Mudacumura, who is still at large, in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo situation. We look \r\nforward to continuing to engage with States parties and \r\nother States on those and other shared issues of concern, \r\nsuch as information-sharing and witness protection.\r\nIt is critical that the international community \r\nremain committed to working towards coordinated \r\nefforts, both to prevent atrocities before they occur \r\nand to provide accountability for those responsible for \r\natrocities that do happen. Although the international \r\ncommunity has made progress on both fronts, much \r\nwork remains. The United States remains committed \r\nto working in partnership with others to achieve those \r\ngoals. We look forward to continued discussions here at \r\nthe United Nations and to our upcoming participation \r\nas an observer at the Assembly of States Parties to the \r\nRome Statute of the ICC in The Hague next month.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): I join others in \r\nthanking the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for his statement \r\nand for presenting the ninth report of the Court to \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/68/314). I commend the \r\njudges of the ICC for their role in contributing to the \r\nrule of law and to the development of international \r\ncriminal law.\r\nBrazil remains steadfast in its commitment to the \r\nRome Statute and to the cause of justice that is its raison \r\n13-54081 9/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nNew Zealand is committed to the principle of \r\naccountability and to the fight against impunity. \r\nWe also recognize that there are a variety of ways to \r\naddress grave crimes committed in conflict situations \r\nand to rebuild communities once atrocities have \r\nbeen committed. National courts have the primary \r\nresponsibility for the prosecution of such crimes, and \r\nNew Zealand supports a focus on complementarity. We \r\nhave also seen the real value of alternatives to formal \r\njudicial processes, such as truth and reconciliation \r\ncommissions.\r\nMoreover, in particular situations, regional Courts \r\nalso make a lot of sense. They are complementary to \r\nboth national and international mechanisms. In that \r\nregard, New Zealand is pleased to be involved in \r\nsupporting the development of the African Court on \r\nHuman and Peoples’ Rights.\r\nThe diversity of judicial and non-judicial responses \r\nto allegations that grave crimes have been committed \r\nin conflict situations demonstrates that every situation \r\nhas its own complex dynamics. There is no single right \r\nanswer. Finding a sustainable solution to a particular \r\nconflict situation, which is also inevitably riven \r\nwith politics, requires much more than the technical \r\napplication of criminal law.\r\nWe cannot hide from the reality that the Court \r\nis currently facing the strongest challenge of its \r\n10-year existence. New Zealand recognizes the very \r\nreal concerns of the African Union and Kenya and \r\nbelieves that those concerns require careful and serious \r\nconsideration. We also see the current challenges to the \r\nCourt as an opportunity to put the Court on a more solid \r\nfooting, so that it can continue to serve the international \r\ncommunity in the future. The independence and \r\nimpartiality of the Court and its processes are of \r\nthe utmost importance, and they must be protected. \r\nHowever, as States, we have the responsibility to \r\nengage in open dialogue on those challenges. Most \r\nimportantly, we should be prepared to state when we \r\nthink changes might be required.\r\nWhen a Court loses its credibility in the eyes of a \r\nlarge segment of the community, those with political \r\nand legislative responsibility have a right and a duty \r\nto act so as to restore its effectiveness and credibility. \r\nTo that end, New Zealand believes that there are ways \r\nin which member States of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute can and should respond to \r\nthe concerns of those States parties that have raised \r\nmust go beyond rhetoric. President Song himself has \r\nquestioned the sustainability of a system under which \r\nreferrals are made but the costs of any investigation and \r\ntrial proceedings are met exclusively by the Parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nBrazil made a statement in explanation of vote \r\nafter the adoption of resolution 67/295 to voice in \r\nunambiguous terms our deep concern over that issue. \r\nWe agree with South Africa that any say by the \r\nSecurity Council on the budgetary aspects of a referral \r\nwould usurp the competence of the Assembly, violating \r\nArticle 17 of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe latest developments in Africa, including the \r\noutcomes of the latest Extraordinary Summit of the \r\nAfrican Union, are a powerful reminder of the need for \r\nthe Security Council and member States of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties to engage constructively with African \r\nStates. We need to exercise diplomatic wisdom in order, \r\non the one hand, to preserve the international criminal \r\njustice instruments that we have been building, while on \r\nthe other hand, remaining sensitive to requests that are \r\nlegally sound and enjoy widespread political support.\r\nWe must be able to hear the concerns expressed by \r\nAfrican States, without reservations. We are convinced \r\nthat there exists an institutional space to diffuse \r\npolarization, uphold respect for international law and \r\nthe rule of law, and address questions raised by member \r\nStates of the African Union.\r\nThe quest for peace and justice is always \r\nchallenging. It is a key common purpose of both the \r\nUnited Nations and the Court. Our efforts in that regard \r\nmust be informed by the shared values that bring the \r\nGeneral Assembly together, having made the first \r\npermanent, treaty-based International Criminal Court \r\na reality. Brazil stands ready to continue to contribute \r\nto strengthen both objectives.\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand thanks \r\nPresident Song for his report (see A/68/314), and pays \r\ntribute to his ongoing service and that of his fellow \r\njudges on the International Criminal Court.\r\nNew Zealand has traditionally been a very strong \r\nsupporter of the Court. We have invested in the success \r\nof international judicial mechanisms, particularly the \r\nCourt, and we have been active in encouraging a wide \r\nmembership in the Rome Statute, including through \r\nwork to that end in the Pacific region. We continue to \r\nurge widespread membership in the Statute, and we \r\nwill maintain that effort.\r\n10/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nthe Assembly of States Parties to work on resolving the \r\nconcerns raised by Africa.\r\nIn order for the Court to remain viable, there \r\nneeds to be an honest and respectful recognition of the \r\nchallenges and an openness to have dialogue on how best \r\nto address those challenges. Because of our consistent \r\nand strong support for the Court, New Zealand believes \r\nit is necessary to urge the Court and the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties to work on addressing the concerns that \r\nhave been raised.\r\nIn short, New Zealand is committed to playing its \r\npart in these challenging times and to resolving those \r\nissues in a manner that will allow the Court to thrive \r\nas a significant and permanent part of the international \r\narchitecture.\r\nMr. Cancela (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I wish \r\nto thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, Sang-Hyun Song, for presenting the annual \r\nreport of the Court (see A/68/314).\r\nUruguay has historically supported resolving \r\ndisputes through the law, in accordance with the \r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations. Today \r\nwe would like to highlight the important activity of the \r\ninternational courts in meting out justice, and trying \r\noffenders, whoever they may be and wherever they may \r\nbe. After the atrocious violations of human rights in \r\nthe 1990s in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and \r\nthe establishment of the respective ad hoc tribunals, \r\nthe international community understood that an \r\ninternational criminal court was finally needed to \r\ndiscourage any repetition of such aberrations and so \r\nthat those responsible for any such acts could be judged \r\nwith the full weight of the law, whether at the national \r\nor international level.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the fifteenth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. As we mark this anniversary, we \r\nwelcome the development and historical evolution of \r\ninternational law, but fundamentally it is to pay tribute \r\nto the maturity of the international community in its \r\nfight against impunity.\r\nOur country notes with satisfaction that since \r\nthe signing of the Rome treaty, membership in the \r\nCourt has increased significantly. It now has 122 \r\nmembers, equivalent to almost two thirds of the \r\ncurrent membership of the United Nations. We hope \r\nthat this trend will continue and increase so that the \r\nconcerns. Both individually and collectively, through \r\nthe Assembly, States parties have a responsibility to \r\nshoulder some of the burden for making the Court work \r\neffectively.\r\nRules are important and must be respected. But they \r\nare never cast in stone. If there is a problem with the \r\nrules, Member States must be willing to sit down with \r\ncolleagues to work constructively in order to address \r\nthose concerns. We must look for procedural solutions, \r\nincluding the use of modern technology, and find \r\npragmatic ways to address the reality of summoning \r\na sitting head of State before the Court. We urge all \r\nStates parties and Member States to go to the Assembly \r\nof States Parties meeting in November, ready to engage \r\nin its work and with the political will to find solutions.\r\nThe Court and its rules must not make it difficult \r\nfor States parties to cooperate. The Court’s framework \r\nshould be able to accommodate a more f lexible and \r\npragmatic approach to participation in proceedings, an \r\napproach that recognizes exceptional circumstances. \r\nIn such situations, we need to empower the Court to \r\nfacilitate cooperation. All those involved in the work \r\nof the Court, including the Office of the Prosecutor as \r\nwell as States parties, must act in ways that support and \r\nencourage cooperation, taking into account the long-\r\nterm interests of the Court and the wider international \r\ncommunity.\r\nAs a result of concerns with regard to current cases \r\nbefore the Court and other matters, Kenya and members \r\nof the African Union have called on the Security \r\nCouncil to defer those cases. Under article 16 of the \r\nRome Statute, the right to request a unquestionable \r\ndeferral exists, and that should be recognized. There \r\nis a legitimate expectation that when issues related \r\nto the Court are raised, the Security Council will act \r\nresponsibly and respectfully. The request by the African \r\nUnion and Kenya must, therefore, be considered by \r\nthe Security Council with an open mind and a true \r\nwillingness to hear and give proper consideration to all \r\nsides of the argument.\r\nNew Zealand therefore believes that the power of \r\ndeferral, like the power of referral, should be used with \r\ngreat care and restraint, as mentioned by Brazil earlier. \r\nIt also believes that we should not be afraid to use that \r\npower in appropriate circumstances. Deferral should \r\ncontribute to international peace and security, and it \r\nmust be temporary. In that regard, New Zealand notes \r\nthat a deferral might allow more time for the Court and \r\n13-54081 11/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nviolations in Syria to the Court so that perpetrators can \r\nbe brought to trial, regardless of who they are or who \r\nthey represent. In that context, we understand that it \r\nwould be advisable that the permanent members of the \r\nCouncil consider refraining from using their veto to \r\nblock Council action.\r\nIt is quite clear that according to article 115 (b) of \r\nthe Rome Statute, the United Nations should help to \r\npay expenses arising from cases that the Organization \r\nrefers to the Court  through the Security Council so as \r\nto share the financial burden of international criminal \r\njustice. On that basis, we expect that, in accordance \r\nwith article 13 of the Relationship Agreement between \r\nthe Court and the United Nations, the necessary \r\narrangements will be made as soon as possible so that \r\nthat cooperation can be implemented.\r\nWe believe that the existing cooperation between \r\nthe Security Council and the Court should be deepened. \r\nThat means that there has to be some mechanism to \r\nfollow up on cases referred by the Council to the Court.\r\nMs. Paik Ji-ah (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset my delegation would like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for his \r\nprominent leadership and for his comprehensive report \r\non the current activities of the Court. My delegation \r\nalso commends the joint efforts of the Chambers, the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor and the Registry, which have \r\nlaid solid foundations for the effective functioning of \r\nthe Court. We also take this opportunity to welcome the \r\nsolemn undertakings of the new Registrar and Deputy \r\nProsecutor.\r\nSo far, the Court has demonstrated notable \r\nachievements with its involvement in eight situations, \r\nin Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nCentral African Republic, Kenya, Côte d’Ivoire, the \r\nSudan, Libya and Mali. We note that the caseload of the \r\nChambers has increased significantly in the past year.\r\nThe Trial Chamber issued its first acquittal \r\nregarding the situation in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo last December. The Pre-Trial Chamber \r\nissued very contrasting decisions on Libya’s \r\nadmissibility challenges on two cases. We expect \r\nthat when the screening procedure of the Appeals \r\nChamber is completed, those two examples will \r\ncontribute to the precise interpretation of the principle \r\nof complementarity and the related articles of the Rome \r\nStatute.\r\nmemberships of both organs will be equal in the near \r\nfuture, and so that the jurisdiction of the Court can \r\nextend automatically to all of humanity. Likewise, we \r\nhope that member States will remain such and will \r\nreconsider the idea of denouncing the Rome treaty, \r\nbecause that would be a harmful step backwards in \r\nterms of the primacy of justice in acts committed by \r\nmen.\r\nUruguay, after ratifying the Rome Statute, was the \r\nfirst country in Latin America to deposit its instrument \r\nof ratification. This year we have the high honour of \r\nbeing the first in Latin America to have deposited the \r\ninstrument of ratification of the Kampala amendments \r\nto the Statute of the International Criminal Court. \r\nThese two acts demonstrate our level of commitment to \r\nthe Court. Currently 11 member States have ratified the \r\namendments. We urge other member States in the region \r\nand other regions to do so, so that the amendments can \r\nenter into force as soon as possible, that is, by 2017.\r\nWe decided to take on the responsibility of becoming \r\nthe regional coordinator for the Group of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean Countries for cases of non-cooperation \r\nwith the Court. That is a considerable task, and, \r\ntogether with the other three coordinators, we can help \r\nthe President of the Assembly of States Parties to the \r\nStaatute whenever there is a case of non-cooperation. \r\nWe hope soon to have the last regional coordinator, for \r\na region that is not yet represented. Both steps taken this \r\nyear denote Uruguay’s strong commitment to the Court \r\nas representative of international criminal justice.\r\nWith regard to cases referred to the Court by the \r\nSecurity Council, we are pleased that this practice was \r\nestablished and trust that its use will continue. The \r\nimpact of armed conflicts and the growing number of \r\nthose responsible for serious violations of human rights \r\ncontinue to be quite disturbing. As a corollary, we \r\nbelieve that the Security Council should act consistently \r\nwhen faced with similar cases or situations.\r\nWe cannot pretend that the Council feels bound \r\nby its previous actions because it is not a court, but \r\na political body. But it is also the organ empowered \r\nby the Charter to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, acting on behalf of the entire international \r\ncommunity. We believe it should act responsibly and in \r\na non-selective manner in dealing with each situation \r\nwhere the peace is threatened. For that reason, we agree \r\nwith a group of countries that believe that the Council \r\nshould be asked to refer the case of human rights \r\n12/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nstrengthen their relationship by building upon the \r\nexisting agreement. Moreover, it is also critical for the \r\nCourt to garner ample support and cooperation from \r\nall States Members of the United Nations. For example, \r\nwithout their full cooperation the ICC cannot execute \r\nthe outstanding arrest warrants for perpetrators of \r\ngrave crimes, nor conduct thorough investigations for \r\nthe appropriate prosecutions.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was established \r\nto embody the principles of the Rome Statute so as \r\nto end impunity and contribute to the prevention of \r\ngrave crimes, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. To fulfil its mandate, the ICC must \r\nbe respected as a non-political, independent judicial \r\ninstitution by all the stakeholders, as well as by States \r\nparties to the Rome Statues. That is how we can expect \r\nthe ICC to continue to pursue criminal accountability \r\nagainst the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern, and thus to continue its positive contribution \r\nto laying a solid foundation for sustainable peace for \r\nthe future.\r\nMy delegation strongly believes that it is in the \r\ninterest of humanity as a whole to uphold the principle \r\nof the rule of law by promoting the functions and work \r\nof the ICC. The Republic of Korea will remain one of \r\nthe strongest supporters of the Rome Statute and of the \r\nICC, and will continue to work tirelessly to attain that \r\ncommon goal of the international community.\r\nMr. Salinas Burgos (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, we would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, the Honourable Judge \r\nSang-Hyun Song, for presenting to the Assembly the \r\nCourt’s comprehensive report covering the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013 (see A/68/314). It \r\ndescribes, inter alia, the investigations currently under \r\nway and reflects the growth in the Court’s activities. \r\nWe also take this opportunity to welcome the new \r\nRegistrar and Deputy Prosecutor of the Court.\r\nThe important responsibilities of the International \r\nCriminal Court and its work undoubtedly merit the \r\nattention of the international community. For Chile, \r\nthe Court has become the most advanced expression \r\nof the development of international criminal justice \r\nand represents one of the most relevant initiatives in \r\nthat domain in recent times. From the viewpoint of the \r\nprotection of human rights, the establishment of the \r\nCourt is clearly a major advance in the fight against \r\nimpunity, and a clear sign that its States parties are \r\nRegarding the situation in Kenya, we wish to note \r\nthat the case of Mr. Ruto and Mr. Sang is now at the \r\nongoing trial stage in which the accused are present \r\nbefore the judges without any arrest. The recent decision \r\non excusal from continuous presence of the accused at \r\ntrial, made by the Appeals Chamber last week, will \r\nbe a valuable precedent to help international criminal \r\nlawyers understand the legal logic of article 63 of the \r\nStatute.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has devoted itself to \r\nundertaking its duties in spite of an increased workload \r\nin the past year. We wish to note with appreciation that \r\nthere has been progress on the case of Mr. Abdallah \r\nBanda Abakaer Nourain, despite the difficult situation \r\nin Darfur. We also expect that the Prosecutor will keep \r\non doing her best in the prosecution of Mr. Laurent \r\nGbagbo of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nWe note in particular that the Prosecutor has \r\nsucceeded in detaining Mr. Bosco Ntaganda, who is \r\nthe first indictee subject to an ICC arrest warrant to \r\nsurrender of his own will to the custody of the Court. My \r\ndelegation would like to deliver our special appreciation \r\nto the countries contributing in transferring him to The \r\nHague. We believe that the case effectively shows that \r\nthe ICC has now firmly established itself and is widely \r\nrespected as the core institution bringing justice in the \r\nmost heinous crimes taking place throughout the world.\r\nWe may recall that, during our debate on the \r\ndrafting of the Rome Statute in the twentieth century, \r\nnot all of us shared the same view on the establishment \r\nof a permanent court to pursue international criminal \r\njustice. However, since the Statute’s entry into force \r\nin 2002, the number of the State parties has steadily \r\ngrown to 122. During the past year, Côte D’Ivoire has \r\njoined the members as a new State party to the Statute. \r\nThe steps taken have moved us closer to universality \r\nand have simultaneously promoted the overall integrity \r\nof the ICC.\r\nDespite the Court’s remarkable achievements and \r\nconstructive role in strengthening the tribunal system, \r\nthere is still a lot more to do in order to accomplish its \r\nmandate. In addition, those goals cannot be completely \r\nachieved by the efforts of the ICC alone. It is also \r\ncrucial to enhance the international community’s \r\nongoing endeavours in the pursuit of justice, the rule of \r\nlaw and sustainable peace.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize that it is absolutely \r\nvital for the United Nations and the ICC to further \r\n13-54081 13/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nLastly, it would also be appropriate, whenever the \r\nSecurity Council makes a referral to the Court, for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to make suitable arrangements to \r\nensure the financial resources necessary for the Court \r\nto deal with the referral. We reiterate, in that regard, \r\nthat it is important for the Court, in carrying out its \r\nmandate, to have the necessary material and human \r\nresources, in keeping with its judicial tasks and the \r\nlofty functions it must perform.\r\nThe principle of complementarity is the cornerstone \r\nof the Rome Statute, by virtue of which national \r\ntribunals have the primary responsibility to investigate, \r\nbring to trial and punish those guilty of the most serious \r\ncrimes of international concern, as established in the \r\nRome Statue. The International Criminal Court must \r\nbe called on to intervene only in those cases when the \r\nStates in which crimes within their competence have \r\nbeen committed are unable or unwilling to conduct the \r\nrelevant legal proceedings.\r\nIn that connection, we believe it is crucial to the \r\nwork of the Court that the crimes specified under the \r\nRome Statute should be so characterized in domestic \r\nlaw. It is also vital for States to cooperate with the \r\nCourt. For those reasons, my country has made \r\nprogress on legislation to that effect, in accordance \r\nwith the Declaration of the High-level Meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the Rule of Law at the National \r\nand International Levels, adopted on 24 September a \r\nyear ago (resolution 67/1).\r\nWe call on the States that have not yet done so to \r\nbecome parties to the Rome Statute in order to achieve \r\nits universality. We also call on the States parties to \r\nadopt the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute, \r\napproved in 2010. My country is working towards \r\nachieving that goal.\r\nAllow me to take the opportunity to again express \r\nour appreciation to the President of the Court for the \r\nvaluable work of the Court under his presidency and \r\nfor the invaluable contribution it is making in the fight \r\nagainst impunity.\r\nMr. Zellweger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): All \r\nof us gathered here are guided by the same values and \r\nby the same concern that justice must be rendered to \r\nvictims and impunity for the most serious crimes must \r\nend.\r\nThe 20 years that have elapsed since the modern \r\nera of international criminal justice began provide \r\ncommitted, with the international community, to \r\ntravelling further on that path. Chile therefore strongly \r\nsupports the work of the International Criminal Court.\r\nAt the previous session, the Assembly had the \r\nopportunity to commemorate the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute. As the Criminal \r\nCourt enters its second decade, it should continue to \r\nconsolidated as an independent international criminal \r\ntribunal until it acquires a universal character. In that \r\nconnection, we welcome Côte D’Ivoire as a new State \r\nparty to the Rome Statute, becoming the 122th State \r\nparty to the international treaty.\r\nWe are convinced that a close relationship between \r\nthe International Criminal Court and the United \r\nNations, through the latter’s principal organs — the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council — is vital \r\nto the performance of the functions of this international \r\ncriminal tribunal. In sum, the Court assists in \r\nstrengthening the promotion of the rule of law, respect \r\nfor human rights and the fight against impunity, and \r\nthus in achieving international peace and security in \r\naccordance with international law and the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nRome Statute.\r\nWe welcome the existing cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court, \r\nwhich is reflected, for instance, in the report that \r\nthe President of the Court presented to the Assembly \r\nand in the reports of the Prosecutor to the Security \r\nCouncil on situations referred by the Council. Also, the \r\nCourt’s New York Liaison Office is vital in promoting \r\ncooperation and representing the Court at various \r\nmeetings, following developments that are relevant to \r\nit.\r\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate that the \r\nlinkage existing between the Security Council and \r\nthe International Criminal Court, and specifically the \r\npowers of the Council to refer situations or suspend \r\ninvestigations in accordance with articles 13 and 16 of \r\nthe Rome Statute, must be based on consistent criteria \r\nthat demonstrate that the decisions are not arbitrary. \r\nAs a new member of the Security Council, Chile will \r\nemphasize that point. We are also convinced that the \r\nCouncil must follow up on its referrals, in addition to \r\nsupporting its decisions by setting up those criteria, \r\nand without that involving interference in the Court’s \r\nactivities. In addition, with regard to the referrals, \r\nspecial attention must be paid to the refusal of States to \r\ncooperate with the Court.\r\n14/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nsuch a measure is all the more necessary. We therefore \r\nreiterate our call to States from all regions of the world \r\nto join us in demanding accountability in Syria. While \r\nthere is currently no consensus for a referral, the issue \r\nof accountability will not go away. It is essential to \r\ndeal with this question without reservations in the \r\nframework of the upcoming Geneva talks on Syria if \r\nthat country is ever to achieve sustainable peace.\r\nTurning now to the relationship between the ICC \r\nand the United Nations, my delegation welcomes the \r\npublication of the revised guidelines on contacts \r\nbetween United Nations personnel and persons who are \r\nthe subject of an arrest warrant or summonses issued \r\nby the Court. We encourage the Secretariat to strictly \r\nimplement the guidelines and to continue the positive \r\npractice of informing the President of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties and the ICC Prosecutor of relevant \r\ncontacts.\r\nThere cannot be a strong ICC without the support \r\nof the United Nations and the support the entire staff \r\nof the ICC, which enables the Court to handle its ever-\r\ngrowing caseload. We take this opportunity to express \r\nour gratitude for their hard work. It is our sincere hope \r\nthat we will keep working together to make a reality of \r\nour shared values, to render justice to the victims, and \r\nput an end to impunity for the most serious crimes.\r\nMr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): Representing \r\nthe host country to the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) and as the facilitator of last year’s resolution on \r\nthe report of the Court (resolution 67/295), I would like \r\nto thank the President of the Court, Judge Sang-Hyun \r\nSong, for presenting to the General Assembly the ninth \r\nannual report of the International Criminal Court (see \r\nA/68/314) and for his personal efforts to safeguard the \r\nintegrity and independence of the Court. This annual \r\nreport to the United Nations and this very debate we \r\nare having today in the General Assembly highlight the \r\nimportant role the Court plays in our common efforts to \r\nbuild an international community that is characterized \r\nby the rule of law and the respect for human rights, an \r\ninternational community in which there is no place for \r\nimpunity.\r\nAs we have seen time and again, sustainable peace \r\nand security cannot be achieved if the perpetrators of \r\nthe most serious crimes are not brought to justice. To \r\nensure the Court’s success in fighting impunity for \r\nthe most heinous crimes of international concern, we \r\nas an international community must all work together. \r\nample evidence that translating those values into reality \r\nis difficult. It is difficult because the work often has \r\nto be carried out in conflict or fragile post-conflict \r\nsituations, because it is part of the much greater \r\nchallenge of establishing or restoring the rule of law, \r\nand because convicting the perpetrators of crimes is not \r\nenough to meet the essential needs of the victims. It is \r\nalso difficult because we do not always agree on how \r\nwe should accomplish that seemingly unachievable \r\ntask.\r\nThe diverging expectations regarding international \r\ncriminal justice have been expressed more vigorously in \r\nrecent times. Switzerland has been listening carefully, \r\nespecially to the concerns that have been expressed \r\nby some African States. Today we acknowledge that \r\nthat we could have done more to enter into a dialogue \r\nwith those who shared their concerns with us. Today, \r\nhowever, we underline our readiness to openly discuss \r\nthe challenges facing both the States parties and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). Five weeks ago, \r\nat the initiative of Switzerland, 24 ministers from \r\nall regions of the world adopted a declaration of \r\ncommitment to the International Criminal Court. They \r\naffirmed in particular their readiness to engage in \r\ndialogue to resolve outstanding issues that affect the \r\nrole of the Court in the fight against impunity. That \r\noffer is earnest and sincere.\r\nSwitzerland is open for a constructive discussion on \r\nthe functioning of the Rome Statute system, here, in the \r\nframework of bilateral exchanges and at the upcoming \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, in The \r\nHague. The dialogue would be based on our shared \r\nvalues, as mentioned.\r\nThe 122 States parties, including 34 from Africa, \r\nhave voluntarily acceded to the Rome Statute in a \r\ncommon understanding. It is understood that the judicial \r\nindependence of the Court and the irrelevance of the \r\nofficial position of the accused are absolutely essential \r\nfor the credibility and proper functioning of the Court. \r\nStates were willing to confer those rights on the Court \r\nbecause, under the principle of complementarity, \r\neach States retains the sovereign choice to conduct \r\nproceedings at the national level.\r\nNo genuine national proceedings are taking place \r\nin Syria despite all the serious crimes committed there. \r\nSwitzerland and 57 other States have written to the \r\nSecurity Council, calling for a referral to the ICC. In \r\nthe aftermath of the use of chemical weapons in Syria, \r\n13-54081 15/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nIn The Hague just last month, my country \r\norganized a retreat to which all ICC States parties were \r\ninvited. The main topic of discussion was improving \r\nthe relationship between the ICC and several countries \r\nfrom the African region in order to promote and sustain \r\ndialogue among all States parties. Such dialogue should \r\naddress all valid concerns, including those of the \r\nvictims and their communities.\r\nThe Trust Fund for Victims is increasingly important \r\nin supporting both communities and individual victims \r\nof international crimes, including children and victims \r\nof sexual violence. We call on all States to continue \r\ntheir voluntary contributions to that important tool for \r\ncompensation in the future.\r\nBoth the Court’s workload and the expectations \r\nit must meet are high. This year, the Court has made \r\nimportant institutional progress. Steps must be taken \r\nto further enhance the efficiency of the Court, both by \r\nthe Court and by its States parties. As the focal point \r\nof the study group on governance, we will present \r\nseveral concrete, constructive suggestions during the \r\nupcoming Assembly of States Parties.\r\nIt is important to stress here that fighting impunity \r\nfor the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity \r\nand war crimes is a responsibility shared by all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, not just the States \r\nparties to the ICC. Only if States are not willing or \r\nable to fulfil their obligations themselves do we look \r\nto the Court to step in. That has been the case, either \r\nthrough referral or self-referral, in the situations the \r\nCourt currently has under investigation. We must \r\ntherefore strengthen the principle of complementarity \r\nand enhance States’ domestic capacities to investigate \r\nand prosecute the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern. That would strengthen complementarity.\r\nTogether with Argentina, Belgium and Slovenia, \r\nthe Netherlands and an ever-increasing number of \r\nlike-minded States are advocating negotiations with all \r\nMember States on a multilateral treaty to fill the gaps \r\nin the international legal framework for extradition \r\nand mutual legal assistance for the crime of genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. We invite \r\nall those present here today to join us in these efforts \r\nto promote inter-State cooperation in the domestic \r\ninvestigation and prosecution of those crimes.\r\nAt the end of the day, the ICC remains the leading \r\ninternational institution in the fight against impunity \r\nfor the gravest crimes. The report presented here today \r\nAll States have a duty to investigate and prosecute \r\nthose suspected of such crimes, both nationally and \r\ninternationally.\r\nUniversal adherence to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court therefore remains crucial. \r\nMy country, like many others, is pleased to welcome \r\nCôte d’Ivoire’s ratification of the Rome Statute, \r\nbringing the total number of States that have ratified \r\nor acceded to it to 122. It is our sincere hope that many \r\nmore countries will join in the near future. We also \r\ncall on all States parties to swiftly ratify the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression.\r\nThe cooperation and assistance provided by States \r\nparties, non-States parties, the United Nations and other \r\ninternational and regional organizations is important \r\nfor the Court to function well. That is especially true \r\nwith regard to the arrest and surrender of suspects, the \r\nprovision of evidence, the protection and relocation of \r\nvictims and witnesses and the enforcement of sentences.\r\nAs representative bodies of the international \r\ncommunity, the United Nations and its Security \r\nCouncil have an especially important role to play in \r\nsupporting the work of the Court. In that regard, the \r\nNetherlands welcomes the constructive and increased \r\ncooperation between the Council and the Court over \r\nthe past decade. The Security Council in particular \r\nhas a responsibility to provide political and financial \r\nsupport with respect to the situations that it refers to the \r\nCourt. The Netherlands therefore calls on the Council \r\nto remain actively engaged in the situations it refers to \r\nthe Court.\r\nThe Netherlands is also in favour of referring \r\nthe situation in Syria to the ICC, and we regret the \r\ncontinuing disagreement on that issue within the \r\nSecurity Council. A great number of Member States \r\nsigned a letter urging the Security Council to take on its \r\nresponsibility in this matter (A/67/694, annex). Since \r\nthen, a chemical weapons attack against civilians has \r\ntaken place in Syria. The crimes committed cannot and \r\nmust not go unpunished. We remain convinced that a \r\nreferral is appropriate in the absence of alternatives.\r\nAfrican States contributed greatly to the \r\nestablishment of the Rome Statute, and their continuing \r\nsupport for the ICC remains important. It is crucial that \r\nthe concerns regarding the ICC voiced at the most recent \r\nAfrican Union Summit be addressed at the upcoming \r\nAssembly of States Parties through open, constructive \r\ndialogue.\r\n16/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nno impunity for the perpetrators of the most heinous \r\ncrimes. Therefore, the ICC’s complementary role \r\nin deterring and prosecuting such crimes cannot be \r\noverstated. The Court is intended to be a court of \r\nlast resort in the exercise of jurisdiction over crimes \r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court. States parties \r\nhave the primary responsibility to facilitate the legal \r\nand technical capacity of their domestic institutions to \r\ninvestigate and adjudicate international crimes without \r\nreference to the International Criminal Court.\r\nWe welcome the Court’s efforts to promote \r\nthe adoption of implementing legislation and the \r\nreview of domestic laws to facilitate different forms \r\nof cooperation with the Court when it exercises \r\ncomplementary jurisdiction in respect of international \r\ncrimes. An increase in the availability of domestic \r\navenues for the prosecution of international crimes will \r\nnot only reduce the number of cases coming before the \r\nCourt, but will immensely contribute to the suppression \r\nof international crimes, as mandated by the Rome \r\nStatute. States parties are therefore reminded of their \r\nresponsibilities to investigate and try international \r\ncrimes in their domestic jurisdictions.\r\nThe cooperation of States parties with the Court \r\nis critical to the Court’s effectiveness and credibility. \r\nArticle 86 of the Rome Statute imposes an obligation \r\non States parties to cooperate fully with the Court in \r\nits investigation and prosecution of crimes within the \r\njurisdiction of the Court. The extent to which States \r\ncooperate with the Court, as envisaged in article 86 \r\nand other forms of cooperation set out in part 9 of the \r\nStatute, depends on the manner in which the Court \r\ncame to assume the jurisdiction in a situation in \r\nquestion. Where referrals have been made by States \r\nparties, cooperation from such States has invariably \r\nbeen forthcoming. That has largely been demonstrated \r\nin the cooperation of States such as the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, \r\nUganda and Kenya, which resulted in the surrender of \r\nsuspects to the Court.\r\nHowever, with regard to referrals by the Security \r\nCouncil, State cooperation in effecting arrests mandated \r\nby the Court pursuant to such referrals has largely not \r\nbeen forthcoming. The non-cooperation of some States \r\nhas been informed by different considerations about \r\nthe relative balance between the pursuit of justice and \r\npeacemaking efforts in conflict situations. In both \r\nthe Darfur and Libya situations, indictments were \r\nissued without adequate regard for the impact of such \r\nby President Song shows that the Court is working \r\nvery hard to meet the international community’s high \r\nexpectations of it in regard to delivering justice — not \r\nin the last place — to the myriad victims of these crimes \r\naround the world. We commend the Court for its efforts \r\nin improving efficiency and enhancing investigative \r\ncapacities.\r\nFor the Court to continue to bring justice to the \r\nvictims of the most heinous of crimes worldwide, we \r\ncannot stress enough the importance of its independent \r\njudicial role. We as States have a responsibility to \r\nsupport it and keep it free from political considerations.\r\nWe cannot and must not underestimate the \r\npositive impact the Court has had in the first decade \r\nof its existence. It has contributed greatly to the \r\nfight against impunity, making our time the age of \r\naccountability. As my Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nFranciscus Timmermans, said last year at the tenth \r\nanniversary of the ICC in The Hague, in the Hall of \r\nKnights, prevention, protection and prosecution are \r\nclosely linked. If the ICC truly fulfils its mission, its \r\nefforts will and do contribute to the prevention of the \r\nmost heinous crimes, leading to additional protection \r\nof civilians. It is up to all of us here to ensure that the \r\nICC can continue to fulfil its mission.\r\nMr. Naanda (Namibia): My delegation welcomes \r\nthe latest report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) submitted to the General Assembly (see A/68/314). \r\nWe wish to welcome the President of the Court, Judge \r\nSang-Hyun Song, and to thank him for presenting an \r\nin-depth briefing on the latest engagements of the \r\nCourt.\r\nThe establishment of the Court signified the \r\nfoundation of the principal forum for international \r\ncriminal justice. As the number of States parties \r\ncontinues to increase, we are making good progress \r\nin realizing the full implementation of and universal \r\nparticipation in the Rome Statute. We welcome \r\nthe recent ratification of the Rome Statute by the \r\nGovernment of Côte d’Ivoire, bringing the total number \r\nof African States parties to 35 and the total number of \r\nStates parties to 122. That is a significant achievement.\r\nOur debate on the report of the ICC demonstrates \r\nthe role of the Court in our common efforts to build \r\nan international community characterized by the rule \r\nof law, respect for human rights and a commitment \r\nto global peace and security. My delegation reaffirms \r\nthat for sustainable peace to be achieved, there can be \r\n13-54081 17/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nof last resort. It should intervene only when concerned \r\nnational courts are unable or unwilling to try cases \r\ncommitted on their own territory.\r\nRwanda is of the view that the Republic of Kenya \r\nis able and willing to prosecute all cases related to the \r\n2007 post-election violence, including the cases of its \r\nPresident and Deputy President. Rwanda expresses the \r\nconcern that the trial of Kenyan leaders outside their \r\ncountry would undermine the sovereignty, stability \r\nand peace in that country and in all neighbouring \r\nStates, as well as the reconciliation and reconstruction \r\nprocess and the normal functioning of constitutional \r\ninstitutions. Furthermore, Rwanda would like to \r\nunderline the principles deriving from national laws \r\nand customary international law that Heads of States \r\nand other States’ senior officials are granted immunity \r\nduring their tenure of office. The immunity of sitting \r\nHeads of States was also recognized by the International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nRwanda believes in justice and in international \r\njustice. But my country is of the view that the search for \r\njustice should be pursued in a way that does not impede \r\nor jeopardize efforts aimed at promoting lasting peace. \r\nThat is why, in the aftermath of the 1994 genocide \r\nagainst the Tutsis in Rwanda, Rwanda put in place a \r\nrestorative justice through gacaca courts, which at the \r\nsame time allowed for truth, justice and reconciliation. \r\nThe result is that, despite the genocide that took the \r\nlives of more than 1 million people 19 years ago, \r\nthe social fabric has been rebuilt and Rwandans live \r\ntogether peacefully.\r\nIn conclusion, let me point out that one can rightly \r\nsay that international criminal justice is experiencing \r\na credibility crisis. Hence the need to review what we \r\nhave achieved over the past decades and to chart a way \r\nforward. The key principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, notably the sovereign equality \r\nof States, require that all peoples of the United Nations \r\nfamily — mighty or weak, rich or poor, white, yellow \r\nor black, man or woman — be treated equally. We do \r\nnot want that noble principle to be deformed into a \r\nprocess in which the mighty must sit in judgement of \r\nthe weaker, even when the mighty is guilty of a crime \r\nagainst a weaker counterpart.\r\nMr. Mukongo Ngay (Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo) (spoke in French): Мy delegation has taken note \r\nof the ninth annual report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to the United Nations (see A/68/314), as presented \r\nindictments on the prospects of ending the conflicts in \r\nthose countries. The referral of situations to the ICC by \r\nthe Security Council has proved to be highly political \r\nand controversial, and those situations enjoy the lowest \r\ndegree of State cooperation in the enforcement of court \r\norders.\r\nThe history of the ICC’s creation and the active \r\ninvolvement of African States demonstrate that the \r\nCourt was created for the benefit of victims of serious \r\ncrimes around the world, in particular those in Africa. \r\nIt is therefore not surprising that African States parties \r\nconstitute the biggest bloc in the membership of the \r\nCourt, which is a clear demonstration of the continent’s \r\ncommitment to the work of the Court. It is therefore \r\nimportant to note that the African Union (AU) has \r\nraised concerns with regard to the indictments of sitting \r\nHeads of States, which led to several AU decisions on \r\nthe matter. We therefore underline the need for greater \r\nunderstanding of the concerns raised by the AU, as they \r\nare genuine concerns that may impact on the prospects \r\nof peace and security on the continent.\r\nMrs. Byaje (Rwanda): I thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, for allowing me to present the views of \r\nRwanda on this important topic. Rwanda values this \r\nmeeting, in which we are afforded the opportunity to \r\nconsider whether the international criminal system in \r\nplace has met the expectation of ensuring accountability.\r\nWith regard to the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Rwanda shares the views expressed by the \r\nExtraordinary Summit of the African Union held in \r\nAddis Ababa on 12 October.\r\nThe rule of law is strengthened if there are no \r\nexceptions or double standards in the application of \r\njustice, including international justice. The ICC was \r\nmeant to act independently of political interference. \r\nUnfortunately, its activities have not always lived up \r\nto that expectation. The ICC has been selective in its \r\nmethods of investigating and prosecuting perpetrators \r\nof serious international crimes in that it has so far \r\nfailed to accept the glaring truth that similar crimes \r\nhave been committed with impunity in different parts \r\nof the world. It is evident that political bias and control \r\nand a f lawed methodology are being deployed in the \r\nname of international justice. Yet the ICC proponents \r\nare ostensibly deaf to the increasingly vocal criticism \r\nagainst the Court’s bias regarding Africa.\r\nWith regard to the principle of complementarity, we \r\nare of the view that the ICC should be seen as a court \r\n18/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nand unacceptable. It affects us all, and cooperation \r\nwith the International Criminal Court should form the \r\nfoundation of that concern.\r\nIn terms of cooperation, we always say the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo was the first State \r\nparty to develop significant cooperation with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. My country’s cooperation \r\nwith the Court serves as a model, and several legal \r\ninstruments attest to that. The Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo did not wait for the entry into force of the \r\nRome Statute to ratify it. It ratified it on 30 March 2002, \r\nmore than three months before its entry into force.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo took the \r\ninitiative to refer its situation to the International \r\nCriminal Court itself on 3 March 2004, and signed \r\na judicial cooperation agreement with the Court on \r\n6 October 2004. It also signed a judicial assistance \r\nagreement with the United Nations Organization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nwith the International Criminal Court. In connection \r\nwith the proceedings before the Court, on three \r\noccasions the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nproperly executed arrest warrants issued by the Court \r\nwith regard to its nationals.\r\nAs can be seen, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo is convinced that peace and justice are \r\ncomplementary. It has experienced the irreplaceable \r\nrole of justice as a factor of social harmony, national \r\nreconciliation, peace, security and stability.\r\nThe annual report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to the United Nations, which is now before the \r\nAssembly, underscores the growing importance of \r\nthe work of the Court and of the Rome Statute on the \r\ninternational scene. It reports very significant progress \r\nin the work of the Court, with the start of trials in \r\ncertain cases, the confirmation of charges in others and \r\nthe opening of new investigations in still others.\r\nThe progress in the work of international criminal \r\njustice occurs in the context of the major challenges \r\nthe Court faces, the most important of which remains \r\nnon-cooperation. In that regard, the reality of change \r\nin the perception of the Court, even by some States \r\nthat had previously shown great support for it, should \r\nbe recognized. A sense of injustice and the perception \r\nof unfairness is slowly taking root in the minds of \r\nsome Africans who believe that international justice \r\nhas become a sort of tool for applying pressure on \r\nAfrican leaders. It is essential that the Court put in \r\nby the President of the Court, Judge Song. The Court’s \r\nworkload continues to increase, with eight cases under \r\ninvestigation and eight situations under preliminary \r\nexamination, and two cases have moved to the appeals \r\nstage.\r\nIt is important to recall that the situation in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo was voluntarily referred \r\nto the International Criminal Court by the country’s \r\nauthorities, who acted on behalf of the wounded \r\npopulation of a post-conflict country where what some \r\nrightly called “the first African world war” had taken \r\nplace. The International Criminal Court was created \r\nprecisely to take charge in that type of situation. \r\nTherefore, the creation of the Rome Statute, which is \r\na matter of mere theory for some, remains a tangible \r\nreality that the Congolese people, particularly those in \r\nthe eastern part of the country, experience daily.\r\nIn that regard, it should be noted that the Mouvement \r\ndu 23 mars (M-23), a band of negative forces bankrolled \r\nby foreign interests, was created to prevent the arrest \r\nof Mr. Bosco Ntaganda, who is responsible for war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity — massacres, \r\nassassinations, rape, child recruitment, and so \r\non — that earned him an arrest warrant from the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. The rest is well known. \r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo remains firm \r\nand has paid a heavy price in that difficult fight against \r\nimpunity.\r\nIn the same vein, the recent discovery of two mass \r\ngraves in Kibumba, in the eastern part of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, where it is clear that the negative \r\nforces of the М-23 executed their victims, including \r\nchildren, should lead swiftly to an investigation by \r\nthe International Criminal Court. Furthermore, the \r\nleaders of that terrorist movement, who have long been \r\non the updated lists of persons targeted for sanctions \r\nby the United Nations, the European Union and the \r\nAmerican Government, although they are protected by \r\nneighbouring countries where they have found refuge, \r\nmust know that there will be no impunity. They must \r\nanswer for their acts before the Court. We call on the \r\ncountries harbouring them to cooperate in their arrest \r\nand transfer to the competent legal authorities.\r\nWars and all forms of violence that deny the dignity \r\nand sanctity of human beings do not have a nationality. \r\nThat reality, which some want to limit only to the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in order to evade \r\ntheir obligations and responsibilities, is intolerable \r\n13-54081 19/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nInternational Criminal Court, so that together we can \r\ncontribute to the universalization of the fight against \r\nimpunity.\r\nMr. Ishikawa (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank President Sang-Hyun Song for presenting the \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the International \r\nCriminal Court (see A/68/314). As my delegation has \r\nsaid on many occasions, Japan attaches great importance \r\nto the central role of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) in enhancing the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nIt need be said only once that the ICC plays a \r\nkey role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security through the achievement of justice \r\nand the prevention of grave crimes and violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law.\r\nThe ICC enjoys high credibility throughout the \r\nworld. One hundred and twenty-two States are now \r\nparty to the Rome Statute. Japan would like to extend \r\na warm welcome to Côte d’Ivoire on its joining the \r\nStates parties to the Statute in February 2013. As a \r\nleading supporter of the Court in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion, which as of now is the most underrepresented \r\nregion in the Assembly of States Parties, Japan renews \r\nits commitment to continuing to encourage our Asia-\r\nPacific friends that have not yet done so to ratify or to \r\naccede to the Statute by providing assistance for the \r\ndevelopment of legal systems and human resources.\r\nWe all know that the Court has been playing a \r\nremarkable role in putting an end to impunity against \r\nthe most serious crimes, such as genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. However, it must \r\nalso be acknowledged that the Court cannot achieve its \r\npurpose alone. In that regard, allow me to commend \r\nthe tireless efforts of Ambassador Tiina Intelmann, \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, in addressing the non-cooperation issue by \r\nlistening carefully to the concerns of the relevant States \r\nparties. The difficulties that we now face in that context \r\nmust be overcome in order to advance the cause of the \r\nrule of law.\r\nAs the focal point on non-cooperation for the \r\nAsia-Pacific Group in the Bureau, Japan continues \r\nto underline the importance of cooperating with the \r\nCourt in terms of the execution of the mandate under \r\nthe Rome Statute. Mutual cooperation between the \r\nICC and the United Nations is also crucial. That is \r\nparticularly relevant with regard to the cases referred \r\nplace mechanisms that can curb that perception, which \r\nthreatens to undermine the Court’s reputation and \r\njeopardize its success, even though more than half \r\nof the States Members of the universal Organization \r\njoined the Court less than five years after its entry into \r\nforce.\r\nBut it is equally important that the Court focus on \r\nits own operations, reflect on its working methods and \r\nbecome more professional and less political. Politics \r\nand justice do not necessarily make a good combination.\r\nTo restore the climate of trust between the Court \r\nand the African Union, which is still deteriorating, \r\nsome solutions are needed. First, the dialogue already \r\nunder way between the African Union and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court must be strengthened \r\nin order to revive State cooperation. Secondly, the \r\nprinciple of complementarity in African countries must \r\nbe implemented, while acknowledging that it is first \r\nup to each State to investigate and prosecute the most \r\nserious crimes of international significance. Thirdly, \r\nwe must make the best use possible of the initiative to \r\nexpand the mandate of the African Court on Human \r\nand Peoples’ Rights to include the legal jurisdiction to \r\nrule on international crimes.\r\nIn order to close this chapter, my delegation would \r\nlike to welcome Côte d’Ivoire’s recent entry into the \r\nclub of States parties to the Statute, bringing the \r\nnumber of States parties to 122.\r\nThe Review Conference of the Rome Statute, held \r\nin Kampala in May and June 2010, was a valuable \r\nopportunity for Member States to acknowledge the \r\nachievements of the Rome Statute and reinforce the \r\nbelief that the International Criminal Court is a gift of \r\nhope for future generations and a very important step \r\ntowards the respect of human rights and the rule of law.\r\nIn the Kampala Declaration, States reaffirmed \r\ntheir will to promote the Rome Statute and its full \r\nimplementation, as well as its universality, the record \r\nof international criminal justice and the amendment \r\nof the Rome Statute that now defines the crime of \r\naggression and the conditions under which the Court has \r\njurisdiction over that crime. Those are all achievements \r\nthat we must carefully protect.\r\nIn conclusion, and reiterating my delegation’s \r\ndetermination to ensure the integrity of the Court’s \r\nStatute, I would like to once again urge States that \r\nhave not yet done so to join the mechanism of the \r\n20/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nIn the context of the ICC, there remains a significant \r\nissue regarding the inclusion of the crime of aggression \r\nin its Statute. We believe that the Kampala amendments \r\ndo not fully take into account the Security Council’s \r\npowers under the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nbelieve it to be extremely undesirable that the Court \r\nhave jurisdiction over the crime of aggression without \r\nan appropriate definition by the members of the \r\nSecurity Council. There are some issues concerning \r\nthe implementation of the Kampala amendments on the \r\ncrime of aggression. Such issues could, in our view, \r\njeopardize the Court’s future work.\r\nWe hope that the ICC will continue to work to \r\novercome the challenges that it faces and that it can \r\nfully and effectively implement its mandate. Ultimately, \r\nthe Court’s response to such issues will determine \r\nits future effectiveness as the universal body as the \r\nprincipal international court of law.\r\nMr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): Costa \r\nRica thanks Judge Sang-Hyun Song for presenting \r\nthe most recent report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (see A/68/314) in accordance with article 6 of \r\nthe Relationship Agreement between the International \r\nCriminal Court and the United Nations. We particularly \r\nunderscore its clear and detailed account of the situation \r\nconcerning the most significant judicial and procedural \r\ndevelopments facing the Court. We would like to \r\nwelcome Judge James Stewart as the Deputy Prosecutor \r\nand the election of Herman von Hebel as Registrar of \r\nthe Court.\r\nCosta Rica views with satisfaction the increase in \r\nthe number of States parties to the Rome Statute. We \r\nwelcome its ratification by Côte d’Ivoire in February, \r\nwhich raised the number of States parties to 122. My \r\ncountry is committed to continuing to work for the \r\nuniversality and integrity of the Statute and for the \r\nentry into force of the Court’s jurisdiction over all \r\ncrimes covered by the Statute. In that regard, we wish \r\nto express our gratitude for the work carried out by \r\nthe delegation of Romania in the working group on the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute and to commend the \r\npraiseworthy efforts of the delegation of Liechtenstein \r\ntowards the ratification of the amendment on the crime \r\nof aggression.\r\nThe resolution on the ratification of the \r\namendments to the Rome Statute adopted in Kampala \r\nin 2010 was adopted in the Foreign Affairs Committee \r\nof the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica in August. \r\nby the Security Council. Cooperation strengthens the \r\nCourt’s credibility by meeting the expectations of \r\nvictims and the international community.\r\nIt cannot be overemphasized that the key priority \r\nof international criminal justice is to serve those \r\npeople who have suffered most from grave crimes and \r\nto ensure that such victims and affected communities \r\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Court are supported. In \r\nthat regard, Japan commends the praiseworthy work of \r\nthe Trust Fund for Victims of the ICC for the benefit of \r\nvictims and their families under the leadership of the \r\nChair of the Board of Directors of the Fund, Mr. Motoo \r\nNoguchi.\r\nIn conclusion, Japan remains deeply committed \r\nto providing the ICC its unwavering support, to \r\nfostering an ICC that will be even more efficient, \r\neffective, universal and systemically sustainable and \r\nto contributing to our common goal of ensuring that \r\nthe perpetrators of the most serious crimes are held \r\naccountable.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We have carefully examined the most recent \r\nreport of the International Criminal Court (see A/68/314), \r\nand thank the President of the Court for having prepared \r\nit. Our country is committed to combating impunity for \r\nthe most serious violations of international law that are \r\nof concern to the entire international community. In \r\nthat context, we attach great importance to the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nAs the report of the Court notes, some difficulties \r\nremain regarding its functioning, the key issue being the \r\nfailure of States to execute arrest warrants. In the view \r\nof the ICC leadership, the main negative factor in that \r\nregard arises from the low level of State cooperation \r\nwith the Court. We believe that it is not only an issue \r\nof States and their unwillingness to cooperate with \r\nthe Court. The problems are more systemic, their root \r\ncauses are primarily to be found in the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich, unfortunately, is not an agreed instrument. It \r\nconcerns the inadequate reflection of the powers of the \r\nSecurity Council in that document and the difficulties \r\nin interpreting the provisions of the Statute with regard \r\nto the immunities of State leaders. As a result, in our \r\nview, not without reason the Court often blames regional \r\nshortcomings without taking into account a country’s \r\nparticularities. The concerns recently expressed by the \r\nStates of the African Union affirm that observation.\r\n13-54081 21/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nThe driving force of the Court must remain the \r\npursuit of justice, ending impunity for the worst crimes \r\nand ensuring care for victims, without neglecting its \r\noutreach and information activities. The quantity and \r\nquality of those functions of the Court should not be \r\ninfluenced by financial issues.\r\nGiven the new and timely challenges facing \r\nthe Court, we echo the words of President Song in \r\naffirming our view that the only matters that can \r\nand should be addressed are requests from States or \r\nparties involving proceedings that are fully compatible \r\nwith the legal framework of the Rome Statute and the \r\njudicial powers of its bodies. The legal legitimacy of \r\nthe Court represents its greatest value, and all States \r\nhave the duty to respect and protect it.\r\nIn conclusion, Costa Rica will continue to support \r\nthe universalization, independence and legitimacy of \r\nthe Court, so that we, together with other States parties, \r\ncan “guarantee lasting respect for and the enforcement \r\nof international justice”, as set forth in the preamble of \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nMr. Osman (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation \r\nacknowledges the report (see A/68/314) before the \r\nAssembly today. We believe that the purpose of this \r\ninternational Organization is to actively promote the \r\nvalues of international peace and security and respect \r\nfor human rights, based on the noble purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nemphasizes the important principles of equality among \r\nStates and non-interference in their internal affairs. \r\nOur high hopes for the Organization and its principles \r\nare, however, being threatened and undermined by \r\nthe conduct of certain countries in their dealings with \r\nother States based on a colonial perspective and an \r\ninterpretation of the Charter in a way that suits their \r\nagenda and interests and that reflects negatively on \r\ninternational relations.\r\nAs we review today’s report, it must be acknowledged \r\nthat the current practices of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) and the Office of the Prosecutor clearly \r\nshow a distortion, from a political point of view, in \r\nthe role played by the Court since its inception. In that \r\nframework, we would recall the various reservations \r\nexpressed with respect to the Rome Statute regarding \r\nthe role of the Prosecutor.\r\nEnding impunity remains a goal of justice that is \r\nagreed upon by all and is first, foremost and directly the \r\nresponsibility of the national jurisdiction concerned. \r\nApproval in the plenary remains pending. We hope \r\nthat it will take place in the coming months. Moreover, \r\nmy country ratified the Agreement on Privileges and \r\nImmunities of the International Criminal Court in 2011.\r\nWe also welcome the fact that the working group \r\non the independent oversight mechanism, facilitated by \r\nCosta Rica in The Hague, was able to be agreed. That \r\nwill enable that subsidiary body to begin its monitoring \r\ntasks in accordance with the provisions of article 112 of \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nThe repeated failure of some States parties not to \r\ncomply with the clear and binding obligations under \r\nthe Rome Statute are of great concern to us. Especially \r\nserious is the non-compliance manifested by the refusal \r\nto execute outstanding arrest warrants.\r\nIt must be kept in mind that the Court’s cases, as \r\nPresident Song recalled today, involve the most serious \r\ncrimes against humanity, the victims of which are real \r\npeople, not legal abstractions; they deserve to have the \r\nalleged perpetrators held accountable for their actions. \r\nAs history has shown, there can be no lasting peace \r\nwithout justice.\r\nAnother issue that deserves full attention is the \r\nCourt’s financial situation. Despite the clearly difficult \r\nglobal economic situation, budgetary constraints \r\nmust not be allowed to threaten the functioning of the \r\nCourt, or worse, its independence. The Court’s activity \r\nhas grown substantially owing to grave violations of \r\nhuman rights and dignity and greater acknowledgment \r\nof its jurisdiction. The Court’s docket includes eight \r\ninvestigations, eight preliminary examinations and 23 \r\narrest warrants in relation to eight situations. More than \r\n5,000 victims are participating in its proceedings. All of \r\nthis is reflected in its operating costs and programmes.\r\nFor the coming year, the Court has conducted an \r\nexercise aimed at analysing costs and the efficient \r\nuse of resources and has established a reasonable \r\nand transparent budget. Costa Rica does not support \r\ninitiatives that seek to limit the Court’s scope or \r\ncapacity. That is why we will not support any proposal \r\naimed at a zero-growth budget or the inclusion of a \r\nnew item that relates to the rental costs of the Court’s \r\nheadquarters. We thank the Kingdom of the Netherlands \r\nfor its offer to cover 50 per cent of the rental of the \r\nCourt’s temporary headquarters. However, a balance \r\nof €3 million remains, and my delegation believes it \r\nshould be considered under the Court’s next operational \r\nbudget.\r\n22/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nby members of the African Union, a few metres away. \r\nAt the meeting, five Ministers for Foreign Affairs from \r\nAfrican countries, having been delegated by the African \r\nGroup, are meeting with Security Council members \r\nto express the position that I just now explained, \r\nnamely, that the International Criminal Court has been \r\ntargeting the African continent and African Presidents. \r\nThe ministers are asking the Security Council to defer \r\nall cases previously referred to the Court. The Sudan \r\nwould like to join those ministers in condemning what \r\nhas been taking place in regard to the ICC’s stance \r\ntowards African leaders.\r\nFinally, we are all aware of the selectiveness and \r\ndouble standards that the ICC implements. The ICC has \r\noften overlooked heinous crimes that have occurred \r\nand that continue to occur in several regions outside \r\nAfrica, such as those still being committed against \r\nthe Palestinian people. Where is international justice \r\nthere? Where is the ICC? Where are those who claim \r\nto support the ICC and the Security Council? The \r\nPalestinian people are being killed, and their rights are \r\nbeing violated on a daily basis.\r\nIn conclusion, in the light of the negative practices \r\nof the ICC since its inception, the Sudan today calls \r\non States to reconsider the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court, as noted in today’s report, in order to \r\nensure the sovereignty and independence of the United \r\nNations from that new institution, which has, so far, not \r\nacquired global or universal acceptance.\r\nMr. Huang Huikang (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nChina has always valued the role of international \r\ncriminal justice institutions in promoting the \r\ninternational rule of law and in punishing the most \r\nserious international crimes. China is consistently and \r\nactively engaged in efforts to build the international \r\ncriminal justice system. China supports the \r\nestablishment of an independent, impartial, effective \r\nand universal International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nand we have attended the successive sessions of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court as an observer.\r\nChina wishes to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nsubmitting the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (see A/68/314) to the General Assembly in \r\naccordance with article 6 of the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court and paragraph 19 of resolution 66/262. \r\nThe relationship between the Security Council and the \r\nICC has been rejected by numerous countries because \r\nit has consecrated the influence of a political body over \r\na judicial body. That opinion was reflected by several \r\ncountries participating in the 1998 Conference in Rome.\r\nMy country rejects the politicization of justice, \r\nand consequently considers the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the ICC to be wholly invalid. \r\nThat was shown in the adoption of resolution 1593 \r\n(2005), under which the Security Council referred the \r\nsituation in Darfur to the ICC — a resolution that was \r\nnot adopted unanimously.\r\nLast year during the discussion on this item, my \r\ndelegation warned that the United Nations could \r\nbecome the secretariat of the Office of the Prosecutor. \r\nWe stated that rights given to the ICC in the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the ICC and the United Nations \r\nwere groundless and without legal effect.\r\nThe report indicates the missions that have been \r\nentrusted to United Nations officials and how they \r\nshould deal with the ICC. That reinforces our comments \r\nand endangers the impartiality and the responsible \r\nwork of United Nations officials, as today the Court \r\nis defining the activities and communications of those \r\nUnited Nations officials.\r\nThe current international reality, especially on \r\nthe African continent, has clearly proved that the ICC \r\nhas politicized the concept of justice. That is why the \r\nstance of the ICC has been increasingly rejected on \r\nthe African continent. It all started when the African \r\nUnion requested that the Security Council defer the \r\ncase against the Sudanese President, and recently, that \r\nit defer the prosecution against the Kenyan President \r\nas well. At that Extraordinary Summit of the African \r\nUnion, leaders also strongly condemned the fact that \r\nthe Court had been targeting African leaders, and \r\nit issued a decision that no sitting African President \r\nshould appear before any foreign court.\r\nWe would also like to add that numerous African \r\nleaders and heads of delegations, some of whose \r\ncountries are States parties to the Rome Statute, have \r\nexpressed their concerns as to what is happening on the \r\nAfrican continent and the negative effect it will have \r\non peace and security in Africa. They expressed those \r\nconcerns when discussing the issue during the high-\r\nlevel meetings at the sixty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly in September. Today, as I am addressing the \r\nAssembly, a meeting is being held here in New York \r\n13-54081 23/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\ndevelopment. We maintain that the ICC must strictly \r\ncomply with the complementarity principle, fully \r\nrespect the needs and wishes of national courts to \r\nhandle cases themselves, give positive consideration to \r\nthe legitimate demands of the regional organizations \r\nconcerned, and take actions to assist with national \r\ncapacity-building so as to promote effective jurisdiction \r\nby the countries concerned over the relevant cases.\r\nThirdly, China wishes to reiterate that we support \r\nthe international community in its endeavour to punish \r\nserious international crimes and deliver judicial justice. \r\nAt the same time, we hope that the ICC will ensure that \r\nits efforts to safeguard judicial justice will be conducive \r\nto peace and avoid any negative impacts on the situation \r\nof the countries and regions concerned and the relevant \r\npolitical processes, so that its work will truly advance \r\nthe well-being of populations on the ground. China will \r\ncontinue to follow the ICC’s work and hopes that the \r\nICC will win wider confidence and support through its \r\npractice.\r\nLast but not least, the Chinese delegation would \r\nlike to thank President Sang-Hyun Song of the ICC for \r\ninforming us in a timely way of the latest developments \r\nin the case of President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya. \r\nThe Chinese delegation welcomes the decision issued \r\nearlier today by the ICC deferring the start of the trial \r\nof the case. My delegation holds the view that the \r\nconcerns of Kenya and the African Union should be \r\naddressed properly. China will pay close attention to \r\nthe development of the relevant cases.\r\nMr. Kihurani (Kenya): We appreciate receiving \r\nthe report of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\n(see A/68/314), which provides useful insights into \r\nthe activities of the Court for the period under review, \r\nnamely, 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013.\r\nThe Assembly of State Parties to the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court established an \r\nindependent permanent International Criminal Court \r\nwith authority over the most serious crimes that \r\nthreaten peace and security. The Court, operating under \r\nthe principle of complementarity to national criminal \r\njurisdictions, ensures that effective prosecution \r\nmeasures are taken at the national level with enhanced \r\ninternational cooperation and, where necessary, the \r\nCourt seeks to strengthen that capacity. The Preamble \r\nto the Rome Statute, while recognizing the primacy of \r\nnational criminal jurisdictions, recalls that it is the duty \r\nof every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over \r\nthe perpetrators of serious crimes.\r\nOur thanks go also to President Sang-Hyun Song of the \r\nICC for preparing that report.\r\nI would like to make a few comments on the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the ICC \r\nand on some aspects of the ICC’s work.\r\nFirst, on the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the ICC, China supports cooperation \r\nbetween the two bodies in a manner that conforms to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, Security Council \r\nresolutions and the Relationship Agreement between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Criminal \r\nCourt, as noted in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/68/364). The United Nations and the ICC are closely \r\nlinked. As one of the trigger mechanisms for ICC \r\njurisdiction, the United Nations, through the Security \r\nCouncil, has the right to refer situations to the ICC. As \r\na control mechanism, article 16 of the Rome Statute \r\nstates that the Security Council may request in a \r\nresolution, adopted under Chapter VII of the Charter, \r\nthat no investigation or prosecution be commenced or \r\nproceeded with for a period of 12 months by the ICC, \r\nand the Security Council may renew such a request \r\nunder the same conditions. China believes that for \r\nthe two bodies to fulfil their respective functions and \r\ngoals, the United Nations and the ICC must carry out \r\ncooperation within the legal framework specified in \r\nthe Charter, the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand the Relationship Agreement between the United \r\nNations and the ICC. That is the only way for both sides \r\nto derive benefits from their cooperation.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the principle of the \r\ncomplementarity of ICC jurisdiction, China believes \r\nthat, with the ICC becoming fully operational, the \r\neffective implementation of the complementarity \r\nprinciple has taken on greater importance. Under that \r\nprinciple, national courts have the primary role in the \r\njurisdiction and trial of international crimes. Only \r\nwhen a State is unable or unwilling to deal with the \r\ninternational crimes in question can the ICC step in \r\nto complement the national court vis-à-vis the cases. \r\nHowever, in practice, disputes may arise over whether \r\na particular case falls under the purview of the national \r\ncourt in the country concerned or under that of the ICC.\r\nChina has noted that multiple recent controversies \r\nover cases involving certain African countries, handled \r\nby the ICC, have given rise to resentment and worries \r\non the part of the countries concerned and some \r\nAfrican countries. China is deeply concerned at that \r\n24/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nand the well-being of the world. It is regrettable that \r\nthe Court is not seized of several ongoing situations \r\naffecting large populations of women and children who \r\nbear the brunt of the effects of the commission of the \r\nserious crimes. In that regard, we call upon the Court \r\nto prioritize its resource allocations so as to ensure \r\nthat the finite financial resources, human capital and \r\nconstrained judicial time are directed to areas that \r\nwarrant urgent intervention and involvement; that \r\nis, in places and situations where such interventions \r\nare urgently needed and the impact of which will be \r\nimmediate and have a causal effect on alleviating \r\nhuman suffering.\r\nKenya considers that the Rome Statute is undergoing \r\na test as to its veracity, usefulness and impartiality. The \r\nway in which the Rome Statue is now being implemented \r\ncontradicts what was envisaged during the negotiations \r\non the Rome Statute. In the current implementation of \r\nRome Statute, the international criminal justice system \r\nis faced with a unique historical conundrum that \r\nneeds to be approached constructively, intellectually, \r\npolitically and with a view towards achieving a positive \r\nand constructive outcome and the full realization of the \r\nideals espoused by the Rome Statute’s creators.\r\nIt may appear to the innocent eye that, in the present \r\nstate of interpretation and implementation, the ideals \r\nof Rome Statute, namely, the punishment of serious \r\ncrimes, the fight against impunity, the promotion of \r\nnational healing and reconciliation and reparations \r\nfor victims, may be achieved. However, it is Kenya’s \r\ncontention that the current implementation of the Rome \r\nStatute is counterproductive and antagonistic to those \r\nvery ideals.\r\nIt is in that regard that the international community \r\nand the Court have a very special obligation. We should \r\nrestrain ourselves from adopting a narrow, rigid and \r\nagenda-driven interpretation of the Rome Statute \r\nthat seeks to exclude all other processes relevant and \r\nimportant for sustained international as well as national \r\npeace. Instead, we should advocate for an all-inclusive \r\nand carefully calibrated system with clear benchmarks \r\nand achievable standards. To that end, we must prioritize \r\nand build on the gains of reconciliation, promote \r\nrestorative justice and foster national reconciliation \r\nrather than focusing on meting out raw punishment.\r\nKenya, as a proud member of the community \r\nof nations, has contributed immensely with limited \r\nresources to the achievement of peace, security and \r\nWe note that the report refers, and rightfully so, \r\nto the fact that public and diplomatic support for the \r\nmandate of the Court further contributes to its effective \r\nfunctioning and, furthermore, that the Court requires \r\ntimely and full support from State parties in order to \r\nassist and support the Court in its activities. While \r\nwe agree with those sentiments, we hasten to add that \r\nthe cooperation referred to therein is and should be \r\na two-way process that requires the Court to extend \r\nits cooperation, considerations, accommodation and \r\nsupport, especially those that are mutually beneficial, \r\nto States parties.\r\nThe current superficial, and in our understanding, \r\nwrong interpretation and implementation of the \r\nRome Statute in relation to Kenya shows little or no \r\naccommodation to the concerns of an active, cooperating \r\nState party with a rich history of local jurisprudence. \r\nThe Statute is clearly being applied in a manner that \r\nis highly prejudicial to a Member State’s national, \r\nregional and international interests. In fact, we believe \r\nit is an interpretation consistent with a political agenda \r\nrather than a quest for fighting impunity or a search for \r\nlasting peace or justice.\r\nJustice not only needs to be done but also needs \r\nto be seen to be done. Likewise, perhaps more \r\nimportant, the independence of the Court must not \r\nonly be declared, but should also be seen to be present, \r\napparent and real. Kenya is of the considered view that \r\nsuch is often not the case. We call upon all organs of the \r\nCourt — the presidency, the Office of the Prosecutor, \r\nthe three judicial divisions, the Registry and other \r\noffices — to take immediate action to ensure that their \r\nindependence and that of the Court are not undermined. \r\nCollectively, we need to take urgent steps to ensure that \r\nsuch independence is actualized sooner rather than \r\nlater.\r\nIn that regard, all State parties to the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court should feel that \r\nthey have equal access to the Court and to the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor and that no State party, or non-State \r\nparty for that matter, should have privileged access to \r\nthe Court or the Office of the Prosecutor.\r\nIt is a matter of public notoriety that the Court faces \r\nresource constraints. That has often been cited as a cause \r\nfor its limited operations or involvement in situations \r\nthat warrant the Court’s urgent interventions aimed \r\nat curbing the escalation of crimes against humanity \r\nand other serious crimes that threaten peace, security \r\n13-54081 25/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nand principles of the United Nations — namely, to \r\nmaintain international peace and security and to bring \r\nabout peaceful solutions to conflict in conformity with \r\nthe principles of justice and international law.\r\nInternational criminal law as it stands today is built \r\nupon the pursuit of peace through the fight against \r\nimpunity. Already in 1946, the Nuremburg Tribunal \r\nrecognized that only through fighting impunity can the \r\nprovisions of international law be enforced and peace \r\nattained. The relationship between peace and justice \r\nis therefore ubiquitous in the development of modern \r\ninternational law. That relationship between peace and \r\njustice was evident to the drafters of the ICC Statute. \r\nWe are firmly committed to the idea that peace and \r\nsecurity, on the one hand, and justice and the fight \r\nagainst impunity, on the other, must go hand in hand. \r\nWe find those values, which we emphasize are the \r\nfoundation of the modern system in which we interact, \r\nref lected in the Rome Statute.\r\nIt is important that we remember what we have said \r\nhere, namely, that the relationship between peace and \r\njustice is ubiquitous in the foundation of our modern \r\nsystem and it is similarly present in the Rome Statute. \r\nTherefore, peace is also important, and peace must be \r\ngiven an opportunity to f lourish in any given situation. \r\nBy now all of us are familiar with the contents \r\nof article 16, which provides that investigations and \r\nprosecutions may not be proceeded with for a period of \r\na year after the adoption of a resolution by the Security \r\nCouncil under Chapter VII. Article 16 is present \r\nin the Statute precisely to ensure a complementary \r\nrelationship between the pursuit of justice, on the one \r\nhand, and the attainment of peace on the other. It exists \r\nin the Statute precisely to ensure that, in the pursuit of \r\njustice, peace must be given a chance to f lourish.\r\nAs members of the international community \r\nconcerned about peace and justice, we are concerned \r\nabout indictments that may derail peace processes. For \r\nthat reason, we support the call made by the African \r\nUnion for the Security Council to adopt an article 16 \r\nresolution in the context of Kenya. A precedent was \r\ncreated by resolution 1422 (2002), which the Security \r\nCouncil adopted at its 4572nd meeting, on 12 July \r\n2002. The Security Council, during its adoption of that \r\nresolution, emphasized the importance of international \r\npeace and security. In paragraph 1 of the resolution, the \r\nCouncil, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter,\r\nmultilateralism. We will continue to engage actively \r\nin matters relating to the Rome Statute and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Joyini (South Africa): I am delighted to \r\nwelcome His Excellency Judge Song, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), to New York. We \r\nthank him and his team of judges, not only for the \r\nannual report for the period 1 August 2012 to 31 July \r\n2013 (see A/68/314), but also for their tireless efforts \r\nto promote international criminal justice, with the \r\nultimate objective of securing a peaceful world for all \r\nof us who live in it. As always, we found the report \r\nto be comprehensive, and it touches on very important \r\naspects relating to the work of the ICC.\r\nWe have taken particular note of part II of the \r\nreport, entitled “Judicial proceedings”. As a firm \r\nbeliever in judicial independence, we shall restrict our \r\ncomments to that section. The effective and efficient \r\nfunctioning of the ICC itself, being independent but \r\nalso accountable in its administration, is an important \r\nfactor in bringing an end to impunity and for setting \r\nstandards for the prosecution and adjudication of the \r\nmost heinous crimes of concern to humanity. By trying \r\nthose responsible, the world exposes the truth of the \r\natrocities, deters future crimes and helps to attain \r\njustice for the victims. Victims deserve justice. That \r\nwill happen by strengthening institutions of justice \r\nnationally and internationally. The ICC is central \r\nto that vision, and it must be strengthened to deliver \r\njustice everywhere.\r\nSouth Africa continues to believe that an \r\nimportant tool in the fight against impunity remains \r\nthe efforts to build national capacities to investigate \r\nand prosecute serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community. It is therefore appropriate \r\nthat complementarity is at the heart of the Rome \r\nStatute. It is for that reason that South Africa, together \r\nwith Denmark, continues to exert efforts to mainstream \r\ncomplementarity-related activities.\r\nFor South Africa, the Rome Statute, and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court it created, does not \r\noperate in a vacuum but rather is an important element \r\nin a new system of international law. That modern \r\nsystem is one characterized by greater solidarity that, \r\nwhile remaining true to the principle of sovereignty, \r\nprioritizes the common good. The foundations for that \r\nmodern system of law are of course, contained in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, in particular the purposes \r\n26/27 13-54081\r\nA/68/PV.42 31/10/2013\r\nCanada takes note of the fact that that 122 States \r\nare now parties to the Rome Statute, following the \r\nratification by Côte d’Ivoire on 15 February. We note \r\nthat concerns have been raised by the African Union \r\nand several States in relation to the Court. We are \r\nhopeful that the upcoming Assembly of States Parties \r\nwill provide us with an opportunity to understand those \r\nconcerns better.\r\nCanada encourages all States to abide by their \r\ninternational commitments. It is disturbing that some \r\narrest warrants are not being executed.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada reiterates the need for fiscal discipline. \r\nStates are accountable to their taxpayers, and we \r\ntherefore have to insist on international mechanisms \r\ndeliver good value for the money. While we note that \r\nthe Court has realized savings over the past few years \r\nby way of administrative efficiencies and prioritization, \r\nmore must be done to ensure that costs do not increase.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 75. \r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in exercise \r\nof the right of reply, may I remind members that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Aldahhak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I want to respond to certain statements that \r\nwere made with regard to the situation in Syria today. \r\nWithin the framework of the right to reply, we would \r\nlike to emphasize the following points.\r\nFirst, the primary responsibility for promoting \r\njustice and accountability belongs to States.\r\nSecondly, we cannot accept the use of noble values \r\nsuch as the promotion of justice to serve political or \r\nsuspect agendas. Rather than there being consensus on \r\nsuch values, we have before us a conflict of interest.\r\nThirdly, selective analyses of events in Syria today \r\nwould have it that responsibility lies solely with the \r\nSyrian Government. That does not take into account \r\nthe crimes being committed by armed terrorist groups, \r\nincluding thousands of Takfiris and extremists from \r\nabroad, as well as foreign mercenaries. Not taking \r\nthose crimes into account shows the duplicity of some \r\nin several international forums.\r\n“Requests, consistent with the provisions of \r\nArticle 16 of the Rome Statute, that the ICC, if a \r\ncase arises involving current or former officials or \r\npersonnel from a contributing State not a Party to \r\nthe Rome Statute over acts or omissions relating to a \r\nUnited Nations established or authorized operation, \r\nshall for a twelve-month period starting 1 July \r\n2002 not commence or proceed with investigation \r\nor prosecution of any such case, unless the Security \r\nCouncil decides otherwise”.\r\nIt is because of the relationship between peace and \r\njustice, as it exists in the new value-laden system of \r\ninternational law, that we see no contradiction between \r\nSouth Africa’s continued support for the ICC as a \r\njudicial body mandated to dispense justice, on the one \r\nhand, and our pursuit of the attainment of peace in \r\nKenya through political means, including through the \r\nprocess provided for in article 16 of the Statute, on the \r\nother. For South Africa, therefore, peace and justice \r\nmust necessarily go together. We cannot pursue one \r\nwithout regard to the other, and we certainly cannot \r\npursue one at the expense of the other. They are two \r\nsides of the same coin. And while the Court continues \r\nto pursue justice, the political organs of the system \r\nwe have created, including the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council and the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil, must use all means available to them to ensure \r\nthe attainment and maintenance of peace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, the International Criminal Court is \r\nan institution designed to create a better world through \r\nfighting impunity. We will continue to support the \r\nCourt so that it can grow from strength to strength.\r\nMr. Norman (Canada): Let me first thank President \r\nSong for his report on the activities of the International \r\nCriminal Court (see A/68/314). \r\nCanada supports efforts to ensure that the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern are held to account. It is the duty of all States to \r\nprosecute within their jurisdiction those responsible for \r\nserious international crimes, but if States are unwilling \r\nor unable to do so, international mechanisms may fill \r\nthe gaps and serve as a court of last resort. \r\nThe Court’s decision on 11 October that the case \r\nagainst Mr. Al-Senussi is inadmissible, as he is currently \r\nsubject to domestic proceedings conducted by the \r\nLibyan competent authorities, provides an illustration \r\nof the principle of complementarity in action.\r\n13-54081 27/27\r\n31/10/2013 A/68/PV.42\r\nOne is that it is first and foremost up to the Syrian \r\nauthorities to see to it that the crimes currently being \r\ncommitted are addressed by judicial means. That was \r\nalso something we stressed in our statement, indicating \r\nthat such proceedings had not taken place, and hence \r\nthe letter to the Security Council asking it to refer the \r\nsituation in Syria to the International Criminal Court \r\n(A/67/694, annex).\r\nSecondly, we mentioned the situation in Syria. \r\nWe did not speak of any side in the conflict, we did \r\nnot pinpoint that any side had committed crimes. We \r\nmentioned the situation in the whole of Syria.\r\nThirdly, on the suggestion that Syrian people had \r\nbeen killed by bombs manufactured in Switzerland, I \r\njust wish to say, first of all, that there were no bombs; \r\nthey were hand grenades. We certainly deeply regret \r\nthat Syrian people have lost their lives because of hand \r\ngrenades manufactured in Switzerland. But it is equally \r\nimportant to stress that Switzerland did not export those \r\nhand grenades to Syria. We have not done so in the past \r\nand we are not doing so at present. Those hand grenades \r\nwere brought to Syria by other countries, independent \r\nof the will and control of the Swiss Government. The \r\nSwiss Government has publicly stated how deeply sorry \r\nit is that those hand grenades found their way to Syria \r\nand killed Syrian people. I reiterate that deep regret on \r\nour side. That was the case, but I also stress that we had \r\nno control over the use of those hand grenades.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 75?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\nJustice must be free of selectivity, politicization and \r\nduplicity. That means not closing our eyes to certain \r\nverified war crimes and ensuring accountability for \r\nofficials of certain known Governments deploying \r\nterrorists and mercenaries to Syria from all regions \r\nof the world. Those parties are providing training and \r\nweapons for the commission of terrorist crimes. The \r\nacts of those States that support terrorists are targeting \r\nSyria as a State and the Syrians as a people. It is clear \r\nthat the interests of the Syrian people are not served by \r\nsending terrorists and mercenaries and destroying the \r\ncountry.\r\nWe are grateful to all those who are looking after \r\nthe interests of the Syrian people. We reiterate that \r\nthe only way to protect the Syrian people and to take \r\nsincere steps towards ending the violence is to support \r\nefforts that can lead to the holding of the “Geneva II” \r\nconference in order to arrive at a solution by means of \r\nan inclusive dialogue among Syrians. Only the Syrians \r\ncan determine their future, by exercising their own will \r\nand independence through elections.\r\nWe call on the Swiss Government, which will \r\nserve as host of the Geneva conference, to respect the \r\nright of the Syrian people to make their own decisions \r\nthrough free will. We also call on them to be vigilant \r\non military exports. We regret that a number of Syrians \r\nhave been killed as a result of attacks using bombs \r\nmanufactured in Switzerland. Switzerland is a signatory \r\nto conventions under international law, as pointed out \r\nin Le Matin Dimanche and Sonntags Zeitung. Those \r\nSwiss newspapers have confirmed those events.\r\nMr. Zellweger (Switzerland): I take the liberty of \r\ntaking the f loor again, since the representative of Syria \r\nhas mentioned Switzerland. There are certain points on \r\nwhich we would even agree with the statement made by \r\nthe Syrian representative.\r\n"
