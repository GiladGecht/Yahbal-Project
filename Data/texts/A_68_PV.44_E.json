"The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nSport for peace and development: building a \r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/68/L.8)\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the representative \r\nof the Russian Federation to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.8.\r\nMr. Chernyshenko (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): As the President of the Organizing Committee \r\nfor the XXII Olympic Winter Games and the XI \r\nParalympic Winter Games to be held in Sochi, Russia, \r\nin 2014 — the first time the Games have been held in \r\nmy country — I have the honour to introduce to the \r\nGeneral Assembly a draft resolution entitled “Sport for \r\npeace and development: building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal” (A/68/L.8).\r\nThe draft resolution is inspired mainly by the \r\n2,000-year-old ancient Greek tradition of calling for \r\na truce during the Olympic Games in order to ensure \r\nthe safe passage of athletes to and from the site of the \r\nGames. Together with an appeal for a truce during \r\nthe forthcoming Olympic Games in Sochi, the draft \r\nresolution also calls upon the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to cooperate with the International \r\nOlympic Committee and the International Paralympic \r\nCommittee in their efforts to use sport as a tool for \r\nreconciliation. The draft resolution welcomes the \r\nUnited Nations initiative to designate 6 April as \r\nthe International Day of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace. The Olympic Games in Sochi are to become a \r\nsymbol of constructive dialogue among peoples. The \r\ndraft resolution pays a particular attention to the Sochi \r\n2014 cultural and educational programmes as well as \r\npeacebuilding.\r\nSince the announcement of Russia as host of the \r\nGames, a historic event, we have set ourselves the \r\nambitious goal of conducting innovative Games that \r\nwill express the character of a new, modern Russia and \r\npromote sustainable positive changes. Our vision of the \r\nOlympic Games in Sochi has relied on the consolidation \r\nof the entire nation united by the Olympic dream, the \r\nlegendary athletic traditions of Russia, and the overall \r\nsupport we have for the Olympic values of friendship, \r\nrespect and aspiration to perfection. It is precisely that \r\nvision that has been driving our decisions, efforts and \r\nexpectations on the long road to the Olympic Games.\r\nWe can see already now how our goals are \r\nbecoming a reality. The Games in Sochi have exerted \r\na significant influence on our country by giving an \r\nimpetus, in particular, to the development in Russia \r\nof such socially important phenomena as the volunteer \r\nmovement, the creation of an environment accessible to \r\nall, and the practical implementation of the principles \r\nof sustainable development in accordance with green \r\nstandards.\r\nIn recent years, Sochi has become a venue for \r\nmajor forums dedicated to the strengthening of peace. \r\nThe Generations for Peace International Camp has \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.44\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n44th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 6 November 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Let me note that, for the first time \r\nin the history of the Olympic Games, the Sochi 2014 \r\nOrganizing Committee has engaged volunteer students \r\nin the drafting of an Olympic Truce resolution. \r\nStudents of the Moscow State Institute of International \r\nRelations — future diplomats and policymakers — have \r\nformulated proposals for the initial draft.\r\nThe draft resolution focuses on the need to ensure \r\nand protect the rights of persons with disabilities. \r\nThanks to the Sochi Games, we have managed to make \r\nthe standards of access to buildings and infrastructure \r\nan indispensable and compulsory requirement for \r\nall regions of Russia. The all-Russia project of an \r\naccessibility map makes it possible for persons \r\nwith disabilities to find accessible facilities in their \r\nhometowns, allowing them to become more actively \r\ninvolved in social life.\r\nThe 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics torch relay \r\nhas helped to bring together all of the more than 200 \r\nnationalities living in Russia. The relay started on \r\n7 October in the capital of our homeland, Moscow, \r\nand will be the longest national torch relay in the \r\nhistory of the Winter Olympics in terms of both \r\nduration — 123 days — and distance covered — over \r\n65,000 kilometres. The torch has already visited the \r\nNorth Pole as part of the international research expedition \r\nand became a symbol of joint exploration of the Arctic \r\nby all eight Arctic Powers. And today, at 11.14 p.m. \r\nNew York time, the Olympic torch will be launched \r\ninto space in the international space station and for the \r\nfirst time carried in a spacewalk. This event is one more \r\nstep into the future, and the appearance of the Olympic \r\ntorch in space will be a symbol of the limitlessness of \r\nhuman possibility and of the striving of athletes from \r\nevery country to reach ever new heights in sport.\r\nRussia commends the fruitful cooperation among \r\nStates Members of the United Nations and their \r\ncontributions to the drafting of the text of this year’s \r\ndraft resolution. We are grateful to the International \r\nOlympic Committee, the International Paralympic \r\nCommittee and the Special Adviser of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace for their \r\nconstant support. We are also grateful to the Group of \r\nFriends of Sport for Development and Peace for their \r\nvaluable help.\r\nbeen held in Sochi since 2010. The participants in the \r\nGenerations for Peace International Camp will meet \r\nagain during the Paralympic Games in Sochi in 2014. In \r\n2012, the capital of the future Olympic Games hosted a \r\nprestigious Forum on Sport for Peace. Representatives \r\nof 90 countries participated in its work. The Cultural \r\nOlympiad Sochi 2014, which was launched in 2010, has \r\nunited our country from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok. \r\nFor four years, tens of thousands of events have been \r\nheld across Russia for millions of spectators. The \r\nCultural Olympiad is successfully fulfilling its mission \r\nof preserving and promoting the cultural wealth \r\nof Russia and demonstrating the best examples of \r\nthat wealth to our compatriots and the guests of our \r\ncountry. The best that our culture has to offer will be on \r\ndisplay to visitors at the Games and to the entire world \r\ncommunity during the finals of the Cultural Olympiad \r\nin Sochi.\r\nAn extensive Olympic educational programme, \r\nknown as Sochi 2014, is being rolled out. Annually, \r\nOlympic classes have been attended by over 5 million \r\nRussian high-school students, and thematic shifts \r\ndedicated to the Olympic Truce have been organized \r\nin summer camps. The establishment of the world’s \r\nfirst Russian International Olympic University, \r\noffering education for representatives of all 205 \r\nNational Olympic Committees, is the pinnacle of the \r\nSochi 2014 educational programme. The University \r\nwas inaugurated by Mr. Vladimir Putin, President \r\nof the Russian Federation. Recently, the President of \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, Mr. Thomas Bach, \r\nmet with the students of the University. The first \r\nenrolment in the University included students from 15 \r\ncountries, and there will be a unique opportunity to \r\nput all of their learning into practice during the Sochi \r\nGames.\r\nWe have emphasized in the draft resolution the \r\nimportance of the volunteer movement, both in the \r\nframework of the Games and on a global scale. The \r\nSochi Games have become a powerful catalyst for the \r\nemergence of the volunteer movement in Russia. Based \r\non the volunteer centres located in all federal districts \r\nof the country, hundreds of thousands of Sochi 2014 \r\nvolunteers are conducting their daily work in the regions, \r\nhelping vulnerable groups within the population and \r\naddressing essential social and environmental issues. \r\nSochi 2014 volunteer centres throughout Russia have \r\nalready implemented over 3,000 volunteer projects of \r\ntheir own in addition to preparing for the Games.\r\n13-54989 3/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\ncivilization of ancient Greece, the progenitor of the \r\nmodern Olympic movement.\r\nIn India, sports and physical activities have also \r\nbeen an integral part of our civilization, through the \r\npractice of yoga and its highly evolved system of \r\nphysical, mental and spiritual regimens. Yoga, as a form \r\nof physical and mental exercise, is now popular across \r\nthe world. In addition, India also has a range of highly \r\ndeveloped indigenous games and martial arts. After \r\nIndia attained independence in 1947, the integration \r\nof physical education and sports into formal education \r\nwas emphasized in our first five-year plan. A separate \r\nDepartment of Sports was subsequently set up in 1982, \r\nand a national sports policy was announced in 1984, \r\na year that also saw the establishment of the Sports \r\nAuthority of India, aimed at ensuring the effective and \r\noptimum utilization of various sports facilities, and \r\noverseeing all matters pertaining to sports promotion \r\nand management. India has encouraged the autonomous \r\nfunctioning of national sports federations, and we are \r\nproud to say that the Board of Control of Cricket in India \r\nis one of the most resourceful autonomous sports bodies \r\nin the world. All sectors of our society, including the \r\nmedia and the corporate sector, are actively involved in \r\npromoting sports.\r\nSport is a highly effective tools in achieving \r\ndevelopment objectives in the areas of health, education \r\nand child development. It helps generate public \r\nawareness and inspires broad and inclusive action in \r\nsupport of the development agenda. It is heartening \r\nto note that sport has been recognized as one of the \r\ntools to address development challenges. We appreciate \r\nthe work of the United Nations Office on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, and of the Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace in bringing the worlds of sport and development \r\ncloser together. Efforts should continue to focus on \r\nsport for development, and to root it in the United \r\nNations system.\r\nAssociating sports personalities with the United \r\nNations in order to create public awareness of education, \r\nhealth and development issues, and promoting \r\ntolerance, understanding and peace within and between \r\ncommunities and cultures, is a praiseworthy endeavour. \r\nI would like to mention here that Indian athletes have \r\nalso been associated with different United Nations \r\nentities — the Indian tennis star Vijay Amritraj has been \r\na United Nations Messenger of Peace, and our cricketing \r\nThere are 93 days left until the opening ceremony \r\nof the Sochi Olympic Games, and 121 until that of the \r\nParalympic Games. The Olympic villages, housing \r\nathletes from 85 countries, will be open even sooner, \r\nand within them will rise the walls of the Olympic \r\nTruce, where the athletes can leave their wishes. The \r\nblue f lags of the United Nations will be unfurled above \r\nthe Olympic stadium and villages. We are eagerly \r\nlooking forward to hosting the whole world as our \r\nguests and will do everything we can to ensure that \r\nthe Sochi Olympics are remembered first of all as a \r\ncontest among the greatest athletes of the world in an \r\natmosphere of hospitality, intercultural exchange and \r\nmutual respect.\r\nOn behalf of the Russian Federation, the city of \r\nSochi, the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee and \r\nall our partners, I would like to thank the General \r\nAssembly for its attention and to ask that it support our \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nMs. Singh (India): I feel honoured and privileged to \r\nparticipate in today’s debate on agenda item 11, entitled \r\n“Sport for peace and development: building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nIndia welcomes resolution 67/296, adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session and \r\nproclaiming 6 April as the International Day of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace. We hope that its observance \r\nwill help spread awareness about the importance of \r\nsport as a tool for development and peace. We are also \r\nhappy to be a sponsor of draft resolution A/68/L.8, \r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”, to be adopted by the \r\nAssembly today.\r\nWe also welcome the deliberations in the \r\nthird International Forum on Sport for Peace and \r\nDevelopment, organized jointly in June at United \r\nNations Headquarters in New York by the United \r\nNations Office on Sport for Development and Peace \r\nand the International Olympic Committee (IOC). We \r\nare confident that the collaboration between the United \r\nNations and the IOC will lead to the integration of sport \r\ninto all areas of development and peace and help to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nSince the dawn of human civilization, the intrinsic \r\nlinks between sports, games and the human pursuit \r\nof excellence have been recognized. That pursuit of \r\nexcellence through sport reached its epitome in the \r\n4/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\npreserved and promoted as they can be powerful tools to \r\nhelp educate and send messages of peace, non-violence, \r\nfairness and tolerance to current and future generations.\r\nWe all share the aspiration to live harmoniously \r\nin peace and prosperity. Sport is an exemplary way to \r\ntransmit our shared values through friendly, peaceful \r\ninteractions. It gives us a means to demonstrate the shared \r\nhumanity in all of us and has a unique and strategic role \r\nto play in energizing the public by encouraging actions \r\nat the local, regional and international level in support \r\nof the development agenda. With its power to attract, \r\ninspire and mobilize people, sport can be an effective \r\ntool for conveying crucial messages on matters related \r\nto education, conflict prevention, post-disaster relief \r\nand normalization of life, economic development, as \r\nwell as on issues related to the environment.\r\nMeanwhile, at the international level, Indonesia is \r\nhonoured to take part in the Group of Friends of Sport \r\nfor Peace and Development initiative and to co-sponsor \r\ntoday’s draft resolution with a view to fostering the \r\nculture of sport as an integral part of our life.\r\nFinally, as highlighted by the draft resolution, \r\nIndonesia wishes to underscore the importance of \r\npartnerships among related stakeholders, undertaking \r\nconcrete actions at the local, national, regional and \r\ninternational levels, and promoting and strengthening \r\na culture of peace based on the spirit of sport and the \r\nOlympic Truce. In that regard, Indonesia reiterates its \r\nongoing support for advancing cooperation through \r\nsport for peace and development.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): On \r\n6 February 2014, the United Nations f lag will again f ly \r\nat the Olympic site, side by side with the five rings and \r\nthe Russian f lag, when the Olympic and Paralympic \r\nWinter Games open in Sochi.\r\nOur consideration of agenda item 11, “Sport \r\nfor peace and development: building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, has \r\nspecial and symbolic significance this year because \r\nit allows Monaco to celebrate a moving anniversary. \r\nTwenty years ago, on 25 October 1993, the General \r\nAssembly adopted for the first time a resolution entitled \r\n“Observance of the Olympic Truce” (resolution 48/11) \r\nfollowing an initiative of the Organization of African \r\nUnity presented by Egypt. That was the first draft \r\nresolution that the Principality of Monaco, which had \r\nbecome the 183rd Member State of the Organization a \r\nfew months earlier, had co-authored.\r\nhero Sachin Tendulkar is a Goodwill Ambassador for \r\nthe United Nations Environment Programme.\r\nIndia welcomes the work of the International \r\nOlympic Committee and the International Paralympics \r\nCommittee in promoting and strengthening a culture of \r\npeace based on the spirit of the Olympic Truce. I assure \r\nthem of India’s full cooperation and support in their \r\nefforts to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue \r\nand reconciliation. India also cherishes and celebrates \r\nthe noble ideals and values of the Olympic movement, \r\nand stands committed to furthering international \r\nfraternity, friendship, goodwill and unity. We believe \r\nthat there is no better medium than sport to inculcate \r\nand foster the values of respect, diversity and tolerance \r\nacross communities, civilizations and cultures.\r\nMr. Wijaya (Indonesia): Organized sport enjoys \r\nan honoured tradition, as it has promoted peaceful \r\ninternational interaction among diverse peoples \r\nand nations competing without strife and despite \r\ngeopolitical differences. In that context, we welcome \r\nthe adoption of the biannual draft resolution (A/68/L.8) \r\nbeing considered under the current agenda item, which \r\nshowcases, inter alia, the recognition by Member States \r\nof the unique potential of sport to promote peace and \r\ndevelopment and the valuable contribution of sport in \r\ncreating an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding \r\namong peoples and nations.\r\nAs we are now entering the final push towards the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) before the 2015 deadline, sport can play an \r\nimportant role that generates broad, inclusive and \r\ncommitted action in support of the MDGs and make a \r\nmeaningful difference in the life of people.\r\nIn Indonesia, we have a Ministry of Youth and \r\nSports which is a Government institution dedicated \r\nto developing and integrating sport into our national \r\ndevelopment strategy. The commemoration every \r\n9 September of the National Day of Sports and the \r\nimplementation of the law on the national sport system, \r\nLaw No. 3 of 2005, mark our deep commitment to \r\nnurturing the culture of sport within our society. The \r\nlaw on the national sport system provides a legal basis \r\nfor, inter alia, raising awareness of the relevance of sport \r\nto character-building in our nation and galvanizing \r\nefforts to cultivate in young generations the strong \r\ntraits of discipline, perseverance, competitiveness, \r\nsportsmanship, friendship and unity. The traditions of \r\nthe Olympic Truce and the Olympic ideal need to be \r\n13-54989 5/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nAllow me also to mention the importance of the \r\nUniversiades, organized by the International University \r\nSports Federation, which, like the Olympic Games, \r\ntake place every two years in summer and winter, the \r\nlatest of which was held in Kazan in July. Some 10,000 \r\nuniversity athletes thus carried the f lags of the 162 \r\nparticipating countries. \r\nThe many partnerships among the United Nations, \r\nthe United Nations Office on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, the International Olympic Committee and the \r\norganizers of the Olympic host countries are promising. \r\nThey encourage us to seek all possible contributions to \r\nthe great scheme that inspires us, namely, to achieve a \r\npeaceful and better world.\r\nThe peoples of the world have never been so able to \r\ntravel, meet, engage and fraternize. The arrival of the \r\nOlympic torch in the host country is always a moving \r\nmoment. Following its arrival in Moscow on 6 October, \r\nit has now embarked on one of the longest odysseys of \r\nits history before being set alight in Sochi on 7 February \r\nnext year. It will have travelled no less than 65,000 \r\nkilometres in 123 days from Olympia to Moscow, from \r\nKaliningrad to Anadyr, from Vladivostok to Lake \r\nBaikal and the Black Sea, and even to space, as we \r\nheard this morning.\r\nBut travelling through such a vast area must be more \r\nthan a mere statistic. That unique unifying momentum \r\nhas been fully embraced by the host country, as reflected \r\nin the unparalleled number of 14,000 relay runners who \r\nwill have participated in the torch’s journey.\r\nFor all participants, spectators and fans, the \r\nOlympic Games are not confined to competition or to \r\nseeking a record. Each Olympian takes part in a huge \r\ncommon human adventure with thousands of other \r\nathletes of all outlooks and cultures. Sport is above \r\nall a human voyage within oneself, on the one hand, \r\nto surpass one’s own limits and towards others, on the \r\nother hand, as the main aim is not necessarily to win \r\nbut to share in respecting others.\r\nI congratulate the delegation of the Russian \r\nFederation on the draft resolution and join millions \r\nof spectators who are keenly awaiting the opening of \r\nthe winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in the hope \r\nthat, in line with the Greek tradition for thousands of \r\nyears now, weapons will fall silent. \r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express our appreciation for the \r\nSince then, and during the then-presidency of \r\nJuan Antonio Samaranch, the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC) were able \r\nto forge an increasingly fruitful partnership. That \r\nstrong link was affirmed when the IOC was granted \r\nobserver status in the General Assembly in 2009, under \r\nthe presidency of Mr. Jacques Rogge, whom I wish to \r\ncommend once again for his dynamic accomplishments \r\noriented towards the inclusion of sport for development \r\nand peace. I am also absolutely certain that Mr. Thomas \r\nBach’s vast knowledge of the Committee will allow it \r\npush the shared action of our two organizations even \r\nfurther. I can therefore strongly reaffirm the full support \r\nof my delegation for the work of the Committee, in full \r\ncompliance with the unwavering commitment to the \r\nOlympic ideal of His Serene Highness Prince Albert II, \r\nIOC member and five-time Olympian.\r\nAs resolution 67/296, declaring the International \r\nDay of Sport for Development and Peace, recently \r\nreaffirmed, the mission and role of the International \r\nOlympic Committee — which are to place sport in the \r\nservice of humankind, promote a peaceful society and a \r\nhealthy lifestyle, align sport with culture and education, \r\nand preserve human dignity — have always been held \r\nin our highest esteem. In that context, it is therefore \r\nnatural that the International Olympic Truce Centre in \r\nAthens should be a key player in promoting the ideals \r\nof peace, tolerance, understanding and mutual respect, \r\nunder the banner of the Olympic truce.\r\nThe Olympic Games always arouse strong feelings \r\nand great joy, despite ongoing conflicts. The noble \r\nmission of the Olympic Truce during the Games \r\nreminds us of our lofty commitment to the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe Olympic Charter. On another level, like any sports \r\nevent intended both for professionals and amateurs and \r\nyoung people, the Games also promote values intrinsic \r\nto the exercise of outdoing oneself, respecting others \r\nand bringing cultures closer together.\r\nThat focus inspires the work of the Office of the \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke. Here, I \r\nwelcome the initiative of the youth leadership camps, \r\nthe seventh of which took place from 23 August to \r\n2 September in Gwangju, Republic of Korea, bringing \r\ntogether young people from all regions of the world to \r\nshare, in the context of sport, a unique experience of \r\nlearning from and understanding others.\r\n6/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\nwould also like to congratulate Japan, which will host \r\nthe Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2020. \r\nAs I said earlier, in order to foster that momentum \r\nand to make sport a means for promoting the universal \r\nprinciple of international solidarity, I congratulate \r\nthe Russian Federation on the draft resolution that it \r\nintroduced, entitled “Building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal” (A/68/L.8). \r\nThe draft resolution affirms respect for the Olympic \r\nTruce and the ideals of the United Nations and the \r\nOlympic Movement, namely, friendship among peoples, \r\nharmony, non-violence and non-discrimination. I hope \r\nthat all Member States will support the draft resolution, \r\nthereby sending a strong message to all those that work \r\nfor the noble practice of sport and greatly encouraging \r\nevery athlete. \r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe are grateful for the presentation given on behalf \r\nof the Organizing Committee of the Sochi Winter \r\nOlympics, which we know will be a great success.\r\nSport is an important activity for human development \r\nand cooperation at the national and international levels. \r\nCuba believes that sport is a practice that strengthens \r\nsolidarity and friendship among peoples as essential \r\ncomponents of the promotion of peace, development \r\nand cooperation among nations.\r\nFollowing the triumph of the Cuban Revolution in \r\n1959, sport was no longer an exclusive pursuit in our \r\ncountry and became a right enjoyed by all. In order to \r\nguarantee that right, we have promoted a pedagogical \r\nsystem that incorporates physical education as an \r\nintegral component of education at all stages, which has \r\nled to significant successes in regional and international \r\ncompetitions. At the London 2012 Olympic Games, \r\nCuba, though only a small developing country, took \r\nsixteenth place in the medals table. Cuba also ranked \r\nfifteenth in the Paralympic Games this year, achieving \r\nits best-ever performance with nine gold medals.\r\nIn Cuba, we work to provide sports training from \r\nan early age, which allows us to promote talented \r\nindividuals who go on to become distinguished athletes. \r\nAt the same time, we reject the notion that money is \r\nthe only reward of athletic activity, and we therefore \r\ndenounce the theft of talented athletes from developing \r\ncountries.\r\nFor years, the Cuban sports movement, headed \r\nby the Cuban Olympic Committee and the National \r\nactivities of the United Nations in the area of sport \r\nand the work of the United Nations Office on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace. I would also like to commend \r\nthe efforts of Mr. Wilfried Lemke, Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, and to convey to him our support for peace \r\nand development throughout the world by means of \r\nsport. I also thank Mr. Thomas Bach, President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee. I am convinced that \r\nhe will strengthen the United Nations partnership with \r\nsport.\r\nSport shows how peace can be strengthened because \r\nit has no geographical or social boundaries. Sport is a \r\nway to strengthen social and economic integration at \r\nall levels. It is also a way to develop friendship through \r\nnon-violence, tolerance and justice. Through sport, we \r\ncan resolve problems that arise from crises since it is a \r\nway of bringing people together.\r\nIn view of the importance of sport, the United \r\nNations believes that it can improve and promote \r\nsolidarity among peoples. Given the importance of \r\nsport and physical activity, the connection between \r\nsport and human rights is evident. It helps us to meet \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, as mentioned by \r\nthe Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace.\r\nSport can also be a way to promote peace and \r\nsecurity. In that connection, I would like to thank \r\nthe representative of the Russian Federation for \r\nstrengthening solidarity through sport and the efforts in \r\nthat regard. I express my appreciation for the importance \r\nthat Member States give to sport and its place in national \r\npolicymaking and international policies. It is a way to \r\nstrengthen the bases for education and health.\r\nAllow me also to thank and reiterate my \r\ncongratulations to the Government of the United \r\nKingdom on its successful thirtieth Olympic Games \r\nand fourteenth Paralympics. That helps to strengthen \r\nthe culture of peace and harmony in the spirit of the \r\nOlympic Truce. It can also to act as a catalyst for \r\nfriendship and the spirit of sportsmanship among \r\nathletes whatever their religion or belief.\r\nI would also like to thank all Member States for \r\nthe Truce and for declaring 6 April International Day \r\nof Sport for Development and Peace. Allow me also \r\nto express my support to Brazil for hosting the World \r\nCup and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. I \r\n13-54989 7/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\npeople. Sport will continue to be a major component of \r\nour efforts for the betterment of humankind.\r\nMr. Spinellis (Greece): Dating back to the eighth \r\ncentury B.C., the ancient Olympic Games were meant \r\nto be a force for peace and solidarity among ancient \r\nGreek city-States, which declared a truce for a period \r\nof seven days before the beginning and seven days after \r\nthe end of the Games. Before every Olympiad, heralds \r\nin the city of Elis announced the truce, which was \r\nimplemented as a cessation of hostilities, a prohibition \r\nof entry into the city of military forces, a pause of any \r\nlegal dispute and the suspension of the imposition of \r\ndeath penalties. The ultimate goal was the peaceful \r\nconduct of the Games by protecting the city from \r\ninvasion and ordering individuals and State authorities \r\nto refrain from interfering with the safe passage of the \r\nathletes. As Thucydides claims, if States violated the \r\ntruce, their athletes were banned from participating.\r\nThe concept of the Olympic Truce once born was \r\ncarried out for a period of 1,200 years. Greeks saw in \r\nthe Games a chance to replace conflict with friendly \r\ncompetition. This aspect of Olympism was of great \r\nimportance to Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who revived \r\nthe Olympic Games as a firm believer in their potential \r\nto advance international understanding and promote \r\nworld peace. His initiative paved the way for the \r\nembodiment of the ideal of the Olympic Truce to the \r\nmodern Olympic Games.\r\nIn today’s world, emphasis on Olympic peace has \r\nbecome a major feature of modern Olympic ideology. \r\nThe foundation of the International Olympic Truce \r\nCentre, for the creation of which Greece actively \r\ntoiled alongside the International Olympic Committee, \r\ngave new dynamism to the pursuit of peace. Most \r\nimportantly, the inclusion of the Olympic Truce in the \r\nUnited Nations framework for the first time through \r\nresolution 48/11, in 1993, granted a distinct role to the \r\nideal, given that the United Nations and the Olympic \r\nmovement share common values and goals. We should \r\nbear in mind that in a world of differences, inequalities \r\nand conflicts, even an agreement for a temporary truce \r\nis an achievement for the international community. It \r\nis therefore our responsibility to continue to herald the \r\nOlympic Truce and spare no effort to ensure its actual \r\nimplementation.\r\nIn the context of the United Nations and its role as \r\na forum for world peace, this year’s draft resolution, \r\nentitled “Sport for peace and development: building \r\nInstitute of Sports, Physical Education and Recreation, \r\nhas pursued collaboration with several developing \r\ncountries. Through bilateral agreements, Cuban \r\ntechnicians, teachers and coaches share their sports \r\ntraining methods with many developing countries, \r\nthereby helping to attain even better sporting results \r\nand raise even further the popularity of sport. This \r\ncontributes ultimately to strengthening the bonds of \r\nfriendship among peoples.\r\nCuba has also made its Institute of Sports Medicine \r\nand anti-doping laboratory available to the countries of \r\nthe South in order to contribute to the fight against the \r\nscourge of drugs and and cheating that, in exceptional \r\ncases, corrupts athletes and impedes fair play. The \r\nInternational School of Physical Education and Sport \r\nin Havana trains professionals whose core values are \r\nsolidarity and respect for human dignity.\r\nCuba congratulates the city of Sochi in the Russian \r\nFederation on hosting the XXII Olympic Winter Games \r\nin February 2014 and commends the work carried out \r\nso far. We wish the Games all the success they deserve. \r\nMoreover, we trust that the 2016 Olympics in Rio de \r\nJaneiro, Brazil, will be a success for all of the peoples \r\nof the South, and for those of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean in particular.\r\nThe choice of Sochi and Rio de Janeiro to host \r\nthe Olympic Games is also due recognition of the \r\nefforts devoted and results achieved by the peoples and \r\nGovernments of both countries in terms of economic \r\nand social development for the benefit of their citizens \r\nand others who live on their territories. They can count \r\non our respect and support in their mission to ensure the \r\nsuccess of these celebrations of sport and friendship.\r\nWe emphasize the need to further develop \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity through the \r\nOlympic ideal. Cuba urges greater investment in \r\neducation, health, culture and sport projects by drawing \r\non the billions of dollars currently spent on weapons. A \r\ngreat deal could be done for the right to development of \r\nmillions of people around the world with the resources \r\navailable. All that is needed is political will.\r\nFinally, Cuba reiterates its decision to continue \r\nsharing its greatest sporting asset — the human capital \r\ncreated by the revolution. A genuine commitment to \r\nthe Olympic ideal, our efforts to realize international \r\nlaw and solidarity, and the ongoing struggle for social \r\njustice continue to guide the efforts of the Cuban \r\n8/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\nSport provides a great opportunity for peace \r\nand friendly relations to prevail, and constitutes an \r\nimportant driving force at the national and international \r\nlevels. It spreads the spirit of peace and teamwork, and \r\nit mitigates the threat of wars and animosity. Sport \r\nplays a prominent role in improving the lives of peoples \r\nworldwide. It builds bridges between individuals and \r\nsocieties and provides a fertile ground for peaceful \r\ncordiality. Sport is considered to be a powerful \r\ntool in fostering social links between countries and \r\npromoting peace, solidarity and justice. It also plays \r\na prominent role in enhancing social integration, \r\neconomic development and sustainable development in \r\nall fields, and plays an important role in enhancing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nYoung people are the cornerstone of social \r\ndevelopment. We must therefore exploit their potential \r\nthrough policies, programmes and plans that will \r\ninevitably lead to a prosperous future for nations. The \r\nState of Kuwait attaches great importance to the role \r\nof youth through its Ministry of Youth Affairs and its \r\nPublic Authority for Youth and Sport, which play an \r\nimportant role in training and guiding young people, \r\nimproving their sports achievements and administering \r\ntheir participation in various tournaments, especially \r\nthe Olympic Games. \r\nIn addition, we cannot forget the role of women \r\nin the fields of sport, culture and society. My country \r\nhas worked eagerly to remove all barriers hindering \r\nwomen’s participation in sport games. My country \r\norganized the first Gulf Cooperation Council women’s \r\nhandball tournament in October, in which five Gulf \r\ncountries participated. We also participated in the \r\nXXX Olympic Games in London in 2011, in which 11 \r\nKuwaiti men and women participated. \r\nSport has become an integral part of the United \r\nNations objectives and an effective tool to foster the \r\nprinciples of peace and justice, solidarity and cultural \r\nand humanitarian diversity among peoples. I reaffirm \r\nmy country’s support for making sports a priority at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to commend the interest \r\naccorded by all Member States to the universal nature \r\nof sport as an important tool in fostering peace, \r\ndevelopment, education and health. \r\na peaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal” (A/68/L.8), specifies the request to \r\nStates to observe the Olympic Truce from seven days \r\nbefore until seven days after the Games, mirroring the \r\nperiod of the ancient truce. The draft resolution’s goal \r\nis to reiterate the value of sports, culture, education and \r\nsustainable development towards a peaceful planet. It \r\nfurther elaborates on the role of sports in promoting \r\nsocial inclusion without discrimination of any kind, \r\ntolerance and understanding, aiming at raising \r\nawareness around their potential for peace. In the same \r\nvein, the draft resolution welcomes the establishment \r\nof the International Day of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, the sole goal of which has been set as mobilizing \r\nfor action towards peace.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn 2014, the Russian Federation will host the Winter \r\nOlympic Games in Sochi. I seize this opportunity to \r\nwish Russia every success in that difficult endeavour. \r\nThe task of the rest of us is to meet our responsibilities \r\nby observing the Olympic Truce and making peace a \r\nfeasible goal. We should all find inspiration in next \r\nyear’s Olympic Games and reflect on how sports can \r\nbe used as a propitious tool to reduce tensions and to \r\nbuild bridges. \r\nFinally, with a sense of collectivity, we should \r\nmake a difference and, for the first time — even for a \r\nbrief period of time — we should lay down our arms \r\nand make the Olympic Truce a reality.\r\nMs. Al-Mulla (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): It is a \r\npleasure for my delegation to take part in this meeting \r\nand to deliver a statement on agenda item 11, “Sport for \r\npeace and development: building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”, based on \r\nthe State of Kuwait’s belief in the importance of sports \r\nand the great service it provides to the international \r\ncommunity and to improving relations between nations. \r\nThe State of Kuwait affirms the importance of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s deliberations on sport for peace \r\nand development. It expresses its appreciation for the \r\nwork of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on \r\nSport for Development and Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, \r\nand it pledges to do its utmost to promote the United \r\nNations endeavours in that field. We were honoured \r\nto join in the consensus adoption of resolution 66/5, \r\nentitled “Building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal”, in 2011. We congratulate \r\nRussia on submitting draft resolution A/68/L.8.\r\n13-54989 9/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nthat we want firmly rooted not just in our athletes, but \r\nthroughout our society, in our schools and universities, \r\nas well as in our workforce. We believe we can live \r\nbetter through sports.\r\nSingapore will continue to champion the Olympic \r\nideals through sports. We competed in the 2012 Summer \r\nOlympic Games and the Summer Paralympic Games \r\nwith our largest ever Olympic contingent — 23 athletes \r\nand 8 parathletes, respectively. In 2015, Singapore will \r\nhost the twenty-eighth Southeast Asian Games, which \r\nwill also coincide with our fiftieth anniversary as a \r\nnation and is therefore doubly significant and historic. \r\nOur athletes and parathletes, champions in their own \r\nright, will continue to blaze the trail and inspire many \r\nyoung people to dream bigger.\r\nThe 65,000-kilometre Sochi Winter Olympic torch \r\nrelay has already begun, with the torch recently reaching \r\nthe North Pole. Singapore extends its best wishes to \r\nRussia in hosting a successful Olympic Winter Games \r\nand Paralympic Winter Games in Sochi in February \r\nnext year. We also wish China every success in hosting \r\nthe second Youth Olympic Games in Nanjing in August \r\n2014. We believe that through these Games, sports and \r\nthe Olympic vision will remain a force for good and \r\npeace in this uncertain world.\r\nMs. Cousens (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Sport for peace and development: \r\nbuilding a peaceful and better world through sport and \r\nthe Olympic ideal” (A/68/L.8). We especially want to \r\ndraw attention to the language in the draft resolution \r\n“calling upon host countries to promote social inclusion \r\nwithout discrimination of any kind”. This is the first \r\ntime that language of that kind appears in a resolution \r\non the Olympic Truce, and it sends a powerful message \r\nhighlighting the role that sport plays for all people. \r\nThe phrase emphasizes the importance of the inclusion \r\nand participation of all people in sporting activity, \r\nregardless of identity, including persons of different \r\nsexual orientations and gender identities.\r\nIn its recitation of the fundamental principles of \r\nOlympism, the Olympic Charter states that\r\n“[e]very individual must have the possibility of \r\npracticing sport, without discrimination of any \r\nkind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires \r\nmutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, \r\nsolidarity and fair play”.\r\nMr. Lee (Singapore): Singapore looks forward to \r\nthe adoption today of draft resolution A/68/L.8, entitled \r\n“Sport for peace and development: building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”. \r\nWe are pleased to co-sponsor the draft resolution and \r\nwelcome the ideals that the Olympic Truce represents.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank the former President \r\nof the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Jacques \r\nRogge, for his invaluable contributions to the Olympic \r\nmovement during his 12-year tenure. I also offer our \r\nwarmest congratulations to the new President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, Mr. Thomas Bach, \r\nand am confident that the Olympic ideals will continue \r\nto f lourish under his stewardship.\r\nSport brings many benefits to individuals and \r\ncommunities. It encourages healthy lifestyles and \r\ninculcates the values of humility, hard work, discipline, \r\nfair play and determination. The timeless Olympic \r\nvalues of striving for excellence, demonstrating \r\nrespect and celebrating friendship have inspired our \r\ntop sportsmen and sportswomen to do their best and to \r\novercome their personal limitations through peaceful \r\nrivalry. More importantly, sport has a profound way \r\nof bringing people together in the pursuit of sporting \r\nexcellence, transcending differences in socioeconomic \r\nbackgrounds, cultures and nationalities. And the \r\nOlympic Games, standing at the pinnacle of sporting \r\nachievement, have contributed immeasurably to \r\nthe promotion of peace and greater tolerance and \r\nunderstanding in the world.\r\nSingapore is honoured to be part of Olympic \r\nhistory through our hosting of the inaugural Youth \r\nOlympic Games in 2010. The Games have been a source \r\nof inspiration for us to continue to do everything we \r\ncan to develop and build a strong sporting culture in \r\nSingapore. Our Vision 2030 master plan is a national \r\nstrategy to stimulate positive, deeply embedded values \r\nfor Singaporeans and our nation through sport. We \r\nbelieve that sport can help maintain Singapore’s social \r\nintegrity and economic strength. It can help us overcome \r\nthe challenges presented by an ageing population, rising \r\nregional and international competition, and increased \r\ndiversity within our multicultural and multiracial \r\nsociety.\r\nSport is more than winning medals or keeping fit. \r\nBy its very nature, sport develops the attributes that we \r\nneed to compete in the evolving global conditions: a \r\nwinning spirit, a respect for teamwork, a commitment \r\nto leadership and a love of country. Those are principles \r\n10/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\namong schools, colleges, universities and other learning \r\ninstitutions.\r\nAs the world grapples with the issue of high \r\nunemployment, sport is becoming a sector that is \r\nundeniably creating employment, particularly among \r\nthe young. In a bid to encourage Zambians to get more \r\ninvolved in sports, our Members of Parliament from all \r\npolitical parties regularly play football and other games. \r\nA football team of Zambian Members of Parliament \r\nhas from time to time hosted informal games with \r\ntheir counterparts from Malawi and other countries \r\nof the Southern African Development Community. It \r\nis gratifying to report that our Members of Parliament \r\nhave also engaged diplomats accredited to Zambia in \r\nsports competitions as a means of enhancing mutual \r\nunderstanding and improve mutual cooperation.\r\nMy Government encourages the private sector, as \r\npart of its corporate social responsibility, to support \r\nsports in all parts of the country. Working with \r\nseveral partners, including the International Olympics \r\nCommittee (IOC) and friendly countries like China, the \r\nZambian Government has embarked on the construction \r\nof sports infrastructure, including large-capacity \r\nfootball stadiums, in various parts of the country. To \r\nour gratification, the International Olympic Committee \r\nin 2010 constructed the Olympic Youth Development \r\nCentre in the capital city, Lusaka. The Centre is a pilot-\r\nproject in the series of multi-sport facilities scheduled \r\nto be built in developing countries as part of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee’s Sports for Hope \r\nprogramme.\r\nThe Centre in Lusaka comprises football and \r\nhockey pitches, a running track, tennis courts, a boxing \r\nring and multi-purpose areas that can accommodate \r\nsuch sports as basketball, handball, weight-lifting, \r\nvolleyball, judo and gymnastics. The Olympic Youth \r\nDevelopment Centre is home to some 10,906 children \r\naged between 10 and 17 years who are registered and \r\nactively participate in various sporting activities there. \r\nOf these, 6,624 are male and 4,282 are female. Between \r\n500 and 700 children and youths visit the Centre on a \r\ndaily basis. The Centre offers a wide range of educational \r\nprogrammes, health services and community activities \r\naimed at improving young people’s quality of life.\r\nThousands of athletes from Zambia and \r\nneighbouring countries have already been to the \r\nOlympic Youth Development Centre for training. Since \r\nits inception, it has hosted international tournaments \r\nwith four to eight countries participating. The Centre \r\nMany of the most inspirational moments in the Olympics \r\nhave come through the ever-broadening participation \r\nof persons of various backgrounds in the Games, \r\nincluding Native American Jim Thorpe’s decathlon and \r\npentathlon gold medals in the 1912 Olympics; the four \r\ngold medals African-American Jesse Owens won at the \r\n1936 Berlin Olympics; the three 1960 gold medals of \r\nWilma Rudolph, an African-American woman stricken \r\nwith polio at age 4 whose childhood doctors feared \r\nshe might never walk without wearing a leg brace; and \r\nthe recent inspirational performance of South African \r\nCaster Semenya, who faced unprecedented challenges \r\nand unfair gender testing in 2009, only to return proudly \r\nand medal in the London Games, where her teammates \r\nselected her for the honour of serving as her nation’s \r\nf lag-bearer during the opening ceremony.\r\nPart of what makes sport so important is that it \r\npromotes inclusion, bringing together people of different \r\nages, races, religions, social status, disabilities, sexual \r\norientation and gender identity. Sport embraces all \r\nsegments of society and is instrumental in empowering \r\npeople of diverse backgrounds, while fostering \r\ntolerance and respect for all people, no matter what they \r\nlook like, where they come from, where they worship, \r\nor whom they love.\r\nMr. Silwamba (Zambia): Zambia believes that \r\nsports can play an important role in our societies. \r\nSports promote excellence and a healthier lifestyle and \r\nis a wonderful way of bringing people together from \r\nall walks of life. In Zambia, sports has been a means \r\nof recreation, promoting healthier life styles and, \r\nmore importantly, transmitting life-serving messages, \r\nespecially to young people. Sports has helped my \r\ncountry, especially its young, by keeping them \r\naway from vices such as drug abuse, premarital and \r\nunprotected sex, and beer drinking, among other bad \r\nhabits. Sport has also been an avenue that has helped to \r\nreduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.\r\nSports knows neither gender, tribe, race nor \r\nreligious affiliation. It is a unifier of humankind. The \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Zambia is encouraging \r\ngender mainstreaming in sports and urges more girls \r\nand women to get involved in games. In that regard, the \r\nZambian Government has seen an increase in women \r\nparticipating and winning prizes in sports tournaments. \r\nMany women are now participating in boxing, a sport \r\ntraditionally regarded as a male preserve. Furthermore, \r\nsports is now incorporated into school programmes, \r\nwith regular tournaments held in various disciplines \r\n13-54989 11/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nbody”. Through the strategic plan, we aim to become a \r\ntrue sporting nation whose people engage in physical \r\nexercise and play various sports on a daily basis, \r\nemulating positives trends in many countries around \r\nthe world. Some of the main initiatives to achieve that \r\ntarget include the following.\r\nFirst, in order to cultivate sports for all, the Ministry \r\nof Youth and Sports has undertaken programmes and \r\nactivities to ensure the participation of all, including \r\nthrough the establishment of a variety of sports clubs; \r\nthe promotion and demonstration of various sports; \r\nthe building and upgrading of sports infrastructure \r\nand facilities; and the combining of efforts with the \r\nMinistry of Education and the Ministry of Health in \r\ncreating awareness of the merits of being actively \r\nengaged in sports and its relationship with good health \r\nand good results in education.\r\nThus far, our efforts, along with relentless \r\nawareness campaigns, have yielded encouraging results, \r\nas Malaysians show great interest in running, futsal, \r\npaintball, cycling, wall-climbing and more. In line with \r\nthe spirit of ensuring access to sports for all, Malaysia \r\nhas also undertaken initiatives to promote and raise \r\nawareness of sport and disabilities, and is developing \r\nthat concept to ensure our active participation in \r\nvarious multi-disability competitions, single-disability \r\ncompetitions and single-sport competitions, including \r\nthe Paralympic Games.\r\nSecondly, in order to strengthen the development \r\nof high-performance sports, Malaysia is currently \r\nproducing champions in certain sports. Nevertheless, \r\nwe cannot rest on our laurels, because compared to the \r\nsport achievements of major sporting countries, there \r\nis still a long way to go for Malaysia. Malaysia aims \r\nto increase its performance and improve its ranking \r\nin several sports by investing in their development, \r\nidentifying and nurturing talent and producing \r\nworld-class national coaches via a train-the-trainers \r\nprogramme. The success of that strategic initiative can \r\nbe measured by only one outcome — the number of \r\nmedals achieved in international arenas, including the \r\nOlympic, Commonwealth and Asian Games.\r\nThirdly, in terms of developing sport as industry, \r\nMalaysia has a vision to create a strong industry \r\nbased on sport that can boost the economy and further \r\ncontribute to our gross domestic product. To achieve \r\nthat, strong partnerships between the corporate sector \r\nand the sporting industry must be fostered. Progress \r\ntowards achieving that goal is on the right track, with \r\nhas embarked on a programme to build accommodation \r\nfacilities to house athletes from other parts of Africa \r\nduring training camps and tournaments.\r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and International \r\nOlympics Committee President Mr. Jacques Rogge \r\nvisited the Centre on 25 February 2012 to encourage \r\nyouth participation in sports. My Government \r\nappreciates such support and calls upon our partners \r\nto continue working with us to ensure that the Centre \r\ncontinues to be a model of excellence and a model that \r\ncan be replicated in other parts of the world. Zambia \r\nreaffirms its commitment to promoting sports and to \r\nencourage the young and old alike to get involved in \r\none form of sport or another for their well-being.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): Before the first Olympic \r\ntorch was lit and before a ball was kicked for the first \r\ntime in the World Cup, sports had become part of \r\nour social and cultural identity. Many types of sport \r\nhave evolved since and the spirit of the competition \r\ncarried by each sport is no longer just about winning \r\nor losing. It has gone beyond that. Sport is associated \r\nwith everything that defines us as human: courage, \r\ndetermination, emotions, perseverance, acceptance, \r\ndiscipline, teamwork and much more.\r\nSport somehow has a unique charisma to attract, \r\nmobilize and inspire people all around the world. It is \r\nlike a language that we all speak and understand. It \r\nplays a significant role as a social instrument that can \r\npromote social integration and economic development, \r\nstrengthen social ties and networks, and promote the \r\nideals of peace, fraternity, solidarity, non-violence, \r\ntolerance and justice.\r\nAs a developing nation, Malaysia has identified \r\nsport as a medium that serves as a catalyst to its \r\nnation-building process. Since independence, sport \r\nhas been seen as a means of contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of the spirit of nationalism and national \r\nintegration. In sports, nationalism forms the natural \r\nframework into which people unite and structures the \r\nvaluable consolidation of Malaysia’s society. Malaysia \r\nis fully aware of the positive influence of sport and will \r\ncontinue to utilize sport and its potential by integrating \r\nits values into our national development strategies and \r\napproaches in our society’s capacity-building process.\r\nThe Ministry of Youth and Sports of Malaysia has \r\noutlined its strategic plan for the period 2010-2015 with \r\nthe objective of encouraging Malaysians from all walks \r\nof life to embrace the motto “a healthy mind in a healthy \r\n12/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\npotential to empower, motivate and inspire is amazing \r\nand has no boundaries.\r\nMr. Roet (Israel): On behalf of the State of \r\nIsrael, I would like to thank the Special Adviser to \r\nthe Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, for his important work \r\nencouraging dialogue, collaboration and partnership.\r\nIsrael is proud to be one of the sponsors of today’s \r\ndraft resolution (A/68/L.8), which focuses on sport \r\nas a rallying point. It is interesting that sport, which \r\nbrings people to compete against one another, can \r\ntranscend differences and establish common ground. \r\nPut more simply, sport fosters friendship, cooperation \r\nand understanding. Sport has the ability to touch hearts \r\nand minds and bring tangible benefits to every corner \r\nof the globe.\r\nThroughout the world, there are hundreds of \r\nnon-profit organizations that seek to bridge cultural \r\ndivides and eliminate hatred through sport. In Israel, \r\nthe Peres Center for Peace was founded by Israel’s \r\nPresident Peres to further his vision of having people \r\nin the Middle East work together in genuine friendship.\r\nOne of the programmes run by the Center is the \r\nTwinned Peace Sport Schools. It is the longest-running \r\ncoexistence sport project in the Middle East. Every \r\nyear, close to 2,000 Israeli and Palestinian children \r\nparticipate in programmes with twinned communities \r\nacross the country. The project fosters peace and \r\ncoexistence between young Palestinians and Israelis \r\nby challenging stereotypes. Palestinian and Israeli \r\nchildren unite under a common banner to cheer each \r\nother on and build lasting friendships. Programmes like \r\nthose have two goals: teaching children how to score \r\ngoals and, more importantly, teaching them mutual \r\nrespect, equity and reciprocity. In the process, they can \r\nheal wounds, mend fences and overcome differences.\r\nSadly, not all sporting events have been driven \r\nby those ideals. We recall the 1972 Olympic Games \r\nmassacre in Munich, when Palestinian terrorists \r\nkilled 11 Israeli athletes, coaches and a referee under \r\nthe interlocking rings of the Olympic banner. It is \r\nregrettable that, more than 40 years after the Munich \r\nmassacre, the International Olympic Committee has \r\nrefused all requests to observe a moment of silence in \r\ntheir honour. The memory of that inhumane act is still \r\nfelt in Israel and is a warning for the ages that sports \r\ncannot be used as a vehicle for incitement and hatred.\r\nMalaysia being continually entrusted to host various \r\ninternational sporting events, such as Formula 1, \r\nMotoGP, Le Tour de Langkawi and regattas in Selangor, \r\nKedah, Terengganu and Sarawak, to name a few.\r\nMalaysia’s efforts are not confined to our national \r\ninitiatives. Through the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) ministerial meeting on sports, \r\nMalaysia pursues its interest in sport development and \r\nlends its support to ASEAN and its various bodies, \r\nincluding the ASEAN Football Federation, ASEAN \r\nBasketball League, ASEAN Volleyball Tournament \r\nand ASEAN Para Sports Federation. Realizing \r\nASEAN’s potential for sport in a region of 600 million \r\npeople, Malaysia has proposed that 2013 be designated \r\nthe ASEAN Sports Industry Year, a proposal that \r\nwas accepted by the ASEAN ministerial meeting on \r\nsports. Malaysia is optimistic that the sports industry \r\nwill benefit ASEAN, as the latter is moving towards \r\nbecoming a single community by 2015.\r\nThe free movement of trades and goods will also \r\naccelerate the growth of the sports industry, which \r\npresents valuable commercial opportunities through an \r\nopen market, allowing larger cross-border transactions \r\nin sponsorships, licensing and merchandising; sports \r\ntourism; and broadcasting distribution rights. In \r\naddition, the sports industry will also encourage the \r\ngrowth of areas related to sports medicine, marketing, \r\nevents and management.\r\nIn conjunction with the ASEAN Sports Industry \r\nYear, Malaysia will convene MYSportsFest this year, \r\nan event that will feature 100 sports-related activities, \r\nincluding competitions, exhibitions, carnivals, sports \r\nclinics and talent searches. Apart from encouraging \r\nMalaysians to lead a healthy lifestyle, MYSportsFest \r\nwill provide an opportunity for companies involved in \r\nthe sports industry to promote their products.\r\nWhile sports alone cannot prevent conflict or build \r\npeace, it can assist in peacebuilding interventions. \r\nSports can contribute to an atmosphere of tolerance and \r\nunderstanding among peoples and nations. Through \r\ncollaboration and cooperation, Governments should \r\nstrengthen their efforts to use sports to overcome \r\ndevelopment challenges and, in turn, achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals by 2015.\r\nTo conclude, Malaysia believes in the concept \r\nof sport for development and peace, as it transcends \r\nsociocultural and political barriers. The ability of sport \r\nto reach millions of people all over the world and its \r\n13-54989 13/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nof the General Assembly, towards achieving human \r\ndevelopment and peace through sport.\r\nSports can connect the world. Sports are capable of \r\nuniting and inspiring people in a way that transcends \r\ndifferences such as nationality, ethnicity, gender and \r\npolitical persuasion. Sports are a gift that can be shared \r\nby all, despite our varying abilities. It is for reasons such \r\nas those that Japan is strongly committed to conveying \r\nand sharing the joy of sports and creating a better world \r\nthrough sport. In line with that commitment, we believe \r\nthat sport should be promoted by the international \r\ncommunity and that it should be made available and \r\naccessible to all. No one should be left out, and in \r\nparticular, women and people with disabilities should \r\nbe able to enjoy the same benefits and pleasures of \r\nsports as everyone else.\r\nJapan appreciates the various efforts of the \r\ninternational community to promote the positive use of \r\nsports to build a peaceful and better world. For example, \r\nJapan, as a sponsor, welcomes resolution 67/296, on the \r\nInternational Day of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nwhich was adopted in August under the initiative of \r\nthe United Nations and the International Olympic \r\nCommittee (IOC). I would also like to commend the \r\nRussian Federation for promoting this year’s draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.8, on the Olympic Truce. Japan, as \r\na sponsor of the draft resolution, strongly supports its \r\nspirit of building a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal. We firmly believe that the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Winter Games to be hosted in \r\nSochi next year will realize the ideals and objectives of \r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nOn 7 September, Tokyo was selected to host \r\nthe 2020 Olympic Games. I would like to express \r\nmy sincere appreciation to all those who supported \r\nTokyo’s candidacy to host the Games. I also wish to \r\nheartily commend the tireless efforts of the campaigns \r\nconducted by both Madrid and Istanbul. We were in a \r\ntruly neck-and-neck competition right down to the very \r\nfinal moments.\r\nTowards the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, we are \r\ncommitted to conveying and sharing the joy of sports \r\nand creating a better world through sport. To that end, \r\nas Prime Minister Shinzo Abe stated in the IOC session, \r\nJapan will further contribute to the Olympic movement \r\nby implementing various programmes under our new \r\nplan Sports for Tomorrow, targeted towards more than \r\n10 million people in more than 100 countries, including \r\ndeveloping countries, over the next seven years.\r\nWhile we like to think that the days of discrimination \r\nare behind us, Israel continues to suffer from prejudice \r\nin certain sporting arenas. Only weeks ago, a Tunisian \r\nathlete was ordered to forfeit a quarterfinal match \r\nagainst his Israeli opponent in the Association of Tennis \r\nProfessionals Challenger Tour tennis tournament in \r\nUzbekistan. That f lies in the face of everything that \r\nsportsmanship represents.\r\nToday, we must recommit to advancing sports and \r\nensuring that every athlete is given the opportunity to \r\ncompete. We must commit to being the torchbearers \r\nof the true Olympic spirit, ensuring that sport carries \r\nconnotations of peace, harmony and tolerance and that \r\nit is not hijacked by those committed to fundamentalist \r\nideologies. Sporting initiatives in Israel break down \r\nboundaries such as class, religion, race and even \r\nphysical abilities. Such institutions as the Israel \r\nSports Center for the Disabled are helping to integrate \r\nevery member of society. By encouraging youth with \r\ndisabilities to participate in sports, the organization is \r\nhelping heal psychological and physical wounds while \r\nbuilding self-confidence.\r\nIsrael is sharing its experience using sports to \r\npromote peace and tolerance with countries throughout \r\nthe developing world. Mifalot is the largest and most \r\ndiverse sport-for-development and peace organization \r\nin the Middle East. With over 300 programmes, \r\nMifalot harnesses the power and popularity of football \r\nto build compassionate and cohesive communities. \r\nFrom leadership training to assisting new immigrants, \r\nMifalot helps thousands of people with educational \r\nand social needs. Today, Mifalot applies its successful \r\nmodel to utilize football — the world’s game — as a \r\nplatform for social change in countries ranging from \r\nJordan to Rwanda and from Haiti to Nigeria.\r\nAs Israel’s President Shimon Peres said, “Peace \r\nshould be done not only among Governments but among \r\npeople”. Sports have the ability to unite us, but only \r\nif the politics of coexistence come before the politics \r\nof hate and division. We encourage all people in the \r\nMiddle East and throughout the world to use sports to \r\npromote coexistence, to learn from one another and to \r\nfoster peace and harmony.\r\nMr. Umemoto (Japan): Japan highly appreciates \r\nthe efforts made by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon; \r\nhis Special Adviser on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke; and Mr. John Ashe and \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić, the current and the former Presidents \r\n14/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\nIn recognition of the central and inherent potential \r\nrole that global and traditional sports play in economic \r\nand social development, Ethiopia has made sport one of \r\nits development priorities and been actively working to \r\npromote and develop national sports by incorporating \r\nthem into our overall development agenda, including \r\nin our international relations, in order to develop and \r\nfurther strengthen bonds of friendship and cooperation.\r\nAt the national level, the Government has \r\ndeveloped a comprehensive national sport policy and \r\nstrategic implementation plans. The basic objectives \r\nof this policy are to enhance the participation of the \r\ncommunity in traditional and modern sports and to \r\nmake sporting activities accessible to all, consistent \r\nwith their capacities and preferences, so as to realize \r\nthe fundamental rights of citizens to the enjoyment \r\nof sports. The policy also aims to register great \r\nachievements of international scope by tapping the \r\nhuge potential resources existing in communities, \r\nand in particular among young people, by creating \r\nawareness and enabling environments for various \r\nsocietal purposes.\r\nMore importantly, we are exerting every effort to \r\nuse sport to foster social integration, development and \r\npeace, further promote our national image, enhance the \r\ninclusion of persons with disabilities, ensure that all \r\nschools provide opportunities for students to engage in \r\nphysical exercise during and after school, improve the \r\nquality of education, bring about sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment, promote employment and curb poverty, \r\nand recognize and motivate sport volunteerism in \r\nnational and local sport events by making it an integral \r\nand indispensable part of our sport initiatives. In short, \r\nour Government has been running community-, school- \r\nand youth-based sport development programmes with a \r\nview to realizing our people’s basic right of participation \r\nin sport and leisure activities.\r\nObviously, ensuring and sustaining community \r\nsport and developing elite sport programmes across \r\nthe country requires the investment of a huge amount \r\nof resources. In other words, sport development or \r\npromotion through increasing public participation \r\ncannot be achieved by one particular body alone; \r\nimplementation must be supported with adequate \r\nresources and a broad range of individual, societal and \r\ninternational organizations on the basis of partnerships. \r\nAccordingly, changing our existing low-level sport \r\ndevelopment requires the optimal involvement of all \r\nstakeholders as partners. Sport, as a cross-cutting \r\nSpecifically, we intend to concentrate on the \r\nimprovement of sports facilities, cooperation in sports \r\ncurricula design and the development of international \r\nhuman resources in the sporting arena through \r\ninvitational programmes and by dispatching coaches \r\nand athletes. In addition, we will work closely with \r\nconcerned organizations in further strengthening \r\ninternational anti-doping activities.\r\nJapan will continue to collaborate with Mr. Lemke \r\nand the United Nations Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace (UNOSDP). Among its initiatives, Tokyo \r\nwill host the UNOSDP Youth Leadership Camp in \r\nJanuary next year.\r\nIn the wake of the earthquake of 2011, the people of \r\nJapan received warm support and encouragement from \r\nthe IOC and the international sports community. The \r\n2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London served \r\nas a great source of inspiration to the people of Japan, \r\nand once again opened our eyes to the inherent power of \r\nsports to inspire dreams, hopes and aspirations and to \r\nstrengthen the bonds between people, thus experiencing \r\nourselves the power of sport to make the world a better \r\nplace.\r\nNow it is our turn to do the same. Towards the 2020 \r\nOlympic Games in Tokyo, Japan will strengthen our \r\ncontribution to the achievement of human development \r\nand peace through sports. Japan will make every effort \r\nso that the 2020 Olympic Games can captivate and \r\ninspire people all over the world. We look forward to \r\nthe Assembly’s support and cooperation.\r\nMr. Kebret (Ethiopia): Ethiopia recognizes the \r\nhistorical and diverse roles of sport, be it in the form of \r\ncompetitive sports, physical activities or play. Indeed, \r\nsports not only are physical exercise and games, but \r\nalso have the universal potential power and means to \r\nan end in the sphere of economic, political and social \r\nchange and/or development, as well as in the promotion \r\nof peace and cultural understanding in every society. \r\nHence, sport has become a universal phenomenon and a \r\nlanguage of communication and information that have \r\na potential positive impact on human relations. This is \r\nnot only because sport possesses such unique attributes \r\nnot only for developing healthy human relations in \r\nsociety and with respect to the peaceful relationship \r\nand coexistence of States, but also because it has long \r\nbeen recognized as an essential factor in the realization \r\nof development and peace objectives.\r\n13-54989 15/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nthe Olympic and Paralympic movements to cooperate \r\nwith national and international sports organizations \r\non the use of sport for the purpose of contributing to \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). In addition, acknowledging the contribution \r\nof the volunteer movement to the Olympic Games, \r\nthe draft resolution calls on host countries to promote \r\nsocial inclusion without discrimination of any kind and \r\nrecognize the role of sports in building tolerance and \r\nmutual understanding.\r\nWe believe that the international community must \r\nseek to address and fight all forms of discrimination on \r\nthe basis of race, sex, gender, sexual orientation, gender \r\norientation, disability, age, religion, political or other \r\nopinion, national, social or ethnic origin, or any other \r\ngrounds and to promote respect for diversity.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to restate our commitment \r\nto support the peaceful resolution of existing conflicts \r\nand use this opportunity to urge all Member States to \r\nsend a message of unity and to preserve the Olympic \r\nTruce during the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.\r\nMrs. Gatto (Italy): Italy aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered on behalf of the European Union \r\nand wishes to make the following additional remarks in \r\nits national capacity.\r\nItaly welcomes the imminent adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.8 today and is proud to be among its \r\nsponsors. The strong consensus that we expect today \r\nin the General Assembly demonstrates that the ideal \r\nof the Olympic truce is alive and powerful. We must \r\nnow translate that commitment into reality. Looking at \r\nthe many conflicts taking place around the world, the \r\nchallenge seems daunting, yet ancient history is there \r\nto prove that strong ideals backed by serious political \r\ncommitment can overcome such challenges.\r\nItaly appreciates the new elements introduced into \r\nthe draft resolution this year, in particular the extension \r\nof the period of truce from seven days prior to the \r\nbeginning to seven days following the conclusion of \r\nthe Games, in line with the Greek tradition. The draft \r\nresolution also recognizes the important role of the \r\nInternational Olympic and Paralympic Committees, \r\nas well as their partnership with the United Nations, \r\nin particular the United Nations Office on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace. Along with civil society \r\norganizations and the media, they are actors who \r\nare crucial to raising awareness of the extraordinary \r\nopportunity represented by the Olympic Truce. Special \r\nissue, therefore needs the action-oriented collaboration \r\nof all relevant bodies, such as the United Nations and its \r\nagencies and international sporting organizations.\r\nUnfortunately, in that regard, few or no meaningful \r\npartnerships have been established. For this reason, we \r\nare aware of the need to effectively implement our policy \r\nfor improving national sport development and to work \r\non resource- and capacity-development programmes \r\nin partnership with development agencies, United \r\nNations bodies and international sport movements. It \r\nis only when we act decisively and in collaboration that \r\nwe can harness the power of sport for realization of \r\ndevelopment and peace endeavours.\r\nMy delegation therefore calls upon the international \r\ncommunity, sport partners and other stakeholders to \r\ndevelop and establish partnerships for meaningful and \r\nbeneficial cooperation in the field of sport to enhance \r\nits positive contribution to the sustainable development \r\nand promotion of lasting peace.\r\nFinally, I wish to announce on behalf of my \r\ndelegation that Ethiopia is glad to join the sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/68/L.8, introduced by the Russian \r\nFederation.\r\nMrs. Kazragienė (Lithuania): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the European Union and its member \r\nStates.\r\nThe adoption of draft resolution A/68/L.8, entitled \r\n“Sport for peace and development: building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, \r\nwould put the indispensable interaction between peace \r\nand sport on the front page. The European Union and its \r\nmember States remain faithful advocates of the values \r\nof Olympism and will spare no effort in promoting the \r\nOlympic Truce as an effective means of building peace \r\nand solidarity.\r\nThe Olympic Games have always been inherently \r\nassociated with the ideal of truce. We consider sport \r\nto be an invaluable tool to encourage dialogue and \r\neffectively mobilize the world for the accomplishment \r\nof peace. Furthermore, the concept of the Olympic \r\nTruce provides us with a unique opportunity to achieve \r\nthe cessation of hostilities, even temporarily, and to \r\npromote the peaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nThis year, draft resolution A/68/L.8 increases the \r\nperiod of the observance of the Olympic Truce from \r\nseven days before the beginning until seven days after \r\nthe conclusion of the Games. Moreover, it encourages \r\n16/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\ncountries are prepared to meet their obligations to \r\nabide in good faith by the Olympic principles to which \r\nthey commit when they are given the lofty honour of \r\norganizing the Olympic Games. We are convinced that \r\nsuch actions should be appropriately evaluated at the \r\ninternational level, particularly on the part and at the \r\ninitiative of the leadership of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee and the United Nations. Unfortunately, that \r\nmechanism is not yet functioning effectively.\r\nBelarus is convinced that the XXII Winter \r\nOlympic Games and XI Winter Paralympic Games in \r\nSochi will be conducted at a high level and will be a \r\nvisible affirmation of the contribution that sport and \r\nthe Olympic movement make to building a peaceful and \r\nhappy world. We wish our Russian colleagues every \r\nsuccess in the preparation and holding of the Olympic \r\nand Paralympic Games.\r\nMr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): Ukraine has \r\ntraditionally recognized the value of sport in building \r\na peaceful and better world, promoting tolerance, \r\nequality and understanding among people and nations. \r\nThrough its unique power to bring us together, sport \r\ncan transcend boundaries and unite people irrespective \r\nof their race, religion or political views.\r\nThe Government of Ukraine firmly believes \r\nin sport’s potential to contribute to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and to make \r\na real difference in people’s lives, including those \r\nfrom the most vulnerable groups. In Ukraine sport \r\nand physical education are considered as part of a \r\nbroader perspective on promoting healthy lifestyles and \r\nconstitute a strategic priority in Government policy. We \r\nbelieve that a holistic multisectoral approach to sport \r\ncan be very effective in helpting to achieve the MDGs, \r\nincluding those relating to health and education.\r\nGuided by the noble ideals and principles of \r\nthe Paralympic movement, Ukraine pays particular \r\nattention to the use of sport as a means to rehabilitate \r\npersons with disabilities and enhance their social \r\ninclusion. My country runs a unique State sports \r\ninstitution, the Ukrainian Centre for Physical Education \r\nand Sport for Persons with Disabilities. It consists of \r\n27 regional centres and 106 local offices, with 26 sport \r\nschools for children with disabilities. More than 50,000 \r\npersons with disabilities actively practice sport and use \r\nit for rehabilitation.\r\nUkraine is committed to promoting sport as a \r\nmeans to advance peace and development around the \r\nefforts must be devoted to mobilizing the young people \r\nof the world.\r\nItaly is a strong believer in sport as a powerful tool \r\nand vehicle for promoting peace and development. In \r\n2009 we actively supported the adoption of resolution \r\n64/3, granting observer status to the International \r\nOlympic Committee. Last year in the United Nations we \r\nintroduced the Intercampus Programme, a non-profit \r\nsocial initiative of the Italian soccer team F.C. \r\nInternazionale providing assistance to needy children \r\nand young people in 24 countries around the world. Its \r\naim is to give back to those children their right to play. \r\nThrough football programmes, young people learn \r\nteamwork and the meaning of fair play, and gain access \r\nto health and education services often absent from their \r\nown villages. Intercampus proves that sport can make \r\na difference in the daily lives of many people around \r\nthe world.\r\nAs Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon once said, sport \r\nhas become a world language, a common denominator \r\nthat breaks down all the walls, all the barriers. We hope \r\nthat next February sport will speak the language of \r\npeace and inclusivity. It is in that spirit that we wish \r\nthe Russian Federation every success in organizing the \r\n2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.\r\nMr. Lazarev (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus welcomes draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.8, entitled “Sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment: building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal”, before the \r\nAssembly today. Belarus has joined the list of the draft \r\nresolution’s sponsors.\r\nWe welcome this recognition of the importance of \r\nobserving the Olympic principles at the high level of a \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution. The draft resolution we \r\nwill adopt today can serve as a foundation basis for the \r\nfuture strengthening and observation of the principle of \r\nthe Olympic Truce. That can be ensured if States, the \r\nUnited Nations, the International Olympic Committee \r\nand the chief officials of those organizations play an \r\nactive role in promoting and protecting the Olympic \r\nideals.\r\nWe are convinced that the politicization of issues \r\nrelating to sport and the Olympic Games is contrary \r\nto the principles of friendly and civilized international \r\nrelations, the ideals and principles of sport and the \r\nspirit and letter of the Olympic Charter. Unfortunately, \r\nthe last Summer Olympic Games showed that not all \r\n13-54989 17/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\ndivides, to inspire and unite us all, and to promote peace, \r\ncooperation, intercultural understanding, education \r\nand development. In that regard, we acknowledge \r\nand support the efforts of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee, the International Paralympic Committee, \r\nand the United Nations Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace in areas including poverty alleviation, gender \r\nequality, health promotion, child and youth education, \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention, peacebuilding and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nClearly, the Olympics has an important role to play \r\nin contributing to the promotion of social inclusion; in \r\nbringing together people of differing ages, genders, \r\nraces, cultures, faiths and status; in educating people \r\non such traditional values as respect, diversity, \r\ntolerance and fairness; and in combating all forms of \r\ndiscrimination, including on the grounds of sexual \r\norientation and gender identity. We commend the \r\ninclusion of the simple but comprehensive language in \r\nthe draft resolution calling on all host countries of the \r\nOlympic Games to promote social inclusion without \r\ndiscrimination of any kind.\r\nThe realization of the Sochi 2014 cultural and \r\neducational programmes, which aim to promote cultural \r\ndiversity and enhance understanding between diverse \r\ncommunities, can also contribute to our peaceful \r\ncoexistence. Australia looks forward to participating in \r\nthe Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games and Paralympic \r\nWinter Games.\r\nMr. Elshareef (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of the Sudan would like to express its \r\ncontinued support for the biannual resolution first \r\nadopted in 2011 and entitled “Sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment: building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal”, which is before \r\nus today as draft resolution A/68/L.8.\r\nThe Sudan recognizes that all forms of sports \r\nhave since time immemorial played an important and \r\neffective role in building and promoting relations \r\namong diverse peoples and nations. Sports has played \r\nan important role in modern times both in bringing \r\npeople closer and in effecting a thaw between countries \r\nwith heretofore very icy relations. The delegation of \r\nthe Sudan appreciates the central role played by sports \r\nin promoting the values of patience, cooperation, \r\nperseverance, respect for others and tireless efforts.\r\nThe Sudan, convinced of the importance and value \r\nof sports, including traditional ones, in all societies, \r\nworld. Last year, as a contribution to that goal, Ukraine, \r\ntogether with Poland, hosted the fourteenth Union of \r\nEuropean Football Associations (UEFA) championship. \r\nIt was the first UEFA championship held in Eastern \r\nEurope, and it is our sincere hope that this major \r\nevent succeeded in contributing to a renewed spirit of \r\nfriendship and solidarity in the region and to its social \r\nand economic development as a whole. In 2013 we \r\nhosted the thirty-second Rhythmic Gymnastics World \r\nChampionship, as well as world youth championships \r\nin boxing and athletics, and in 2015 we will host the \r\nthirty-ninth European Basketball Championship.\r\nI have the pleasure to inform the General Assembly \r\nthat yesterday the National Olympic Committee of \r\nUkraine, supported by the Government of Ukraine, \r\nofficially declared its intention to hold the 2022 \r\nWinter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Lviv. \r\nOur vision for the Games goes far beyond economic \r\noutlook, improved infrastructure, new facilities or \r\npromoting Ukraine’s global image. For us it is rather \r\nabout developing a legacy for future generations \r\nbuilt on our collective respect for sport and its basic \r\nvalues — friendship, goodwill, tolerance and fair play \r\nin competition. We have launched a national project, \r\nOlympic Hope — 2022, in support of realizing this \r\ninitiative, with the aim of creating a sports and tourism \r\ninfrastructure in Ukraine suitable for hosting the 2022 \r\nWinter Olympic and Paralympic Games.\r\nMy delegation commends the continued work of \r\nthe United Nations Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace and of the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, in advocating sport as a \r\ntool for achieving peacebuilding, development and \r\nhumanitarian objectives. We would like to assure them \r\nof our full support for their activities. Ukraine is also \r\npleased to be a sponsor of today’s draft resolution \r\nand would like to wish our Russian colleagues well-\r\ndeserved success with the upcoming Winter Games in \r\nSochi.\r\nMs. Hewanpola (Australia): Australia is pleased to \r\nco-sponsor draft resolution A/68/L.8, entitled “Sport \r\nfor peace and development: building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nAs a proud sporting nation and a past Olympics \r\nhost, Australia appreciates the valuable contribution \r\nthat sport and the Olympics have made to enabling \r\npeople to cross language, cultural and geographic \r\n18/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“Olympic principles are United Nations principles,” \r\nsaid Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his keynote \r\nspeech to the 2009 Olympic Congress in Copenhagen. \r\nOur bond became even stronger after the General \r\nAssembly granted the IOC Permanent Observer status \r\nthat same year.\r\nOlympic principles are United Nations principles. \r\nThat is just as true today as the General Assembly \r\naddresses a tradition dating back thousands of years \r\nago in ancient Greece — the ekecheiria. That sacred \r\ntruce, the Olympic Truce, is based on the tradition \r\nthat followed an agreement among three ancient \r\nGreek kings. At that time, the Olympic Games were \r\nthe only bond that linked the Greeks. There was no \r\npolitical unity. Only the Games brought Greeks from \r\nthe mainland and the colonies together, just for a few \r\ndays every four years. The ekecheiria ensured a halt \r\nto hostilities, allowing athletes and spectators to travel \r\nsafely to and from Olympia.\r\nThis shows that even thousands of years ago, \r\na partnership between sports and politics already \r\nexisted. That partnership has been, and is, not without \r\nits frictions, but it endures. Now is the time to adapt it \r\nfor today’s world.\r\nOur partnership today has a completely different \r\ndimension. At the time three city-States came together. \r\nAt the United Nations today we are talking about an \r\nassociation of 193 States, and, at the International \r\nOlympic Committee, 204 recognized National Olympic \r\nCommittees. That is a new dimension of the challenge \r\nin our partnership between politics and sport.\r\nThe IOC is, above all, a sports organization: sport \r\nis its first priority. The IOC recognizes its obligation to \r\nyouth and society by contributing to the betterment of \r\nthe quality of life, in accordance with its fundamental \r\nprinciples as set out in the Olympic Charter, namely:\r\n“to place sport at the service of the harmonious \r\ndevelopment of humankind, with a view to \r\npromoting a peaceful society concerned with the \r\npreservation of human dignity”.\r\nThat describes universal values and goals similar to \r\nthose of the United Nations.\r\nSport is a good starting point for putting those \r\nvalues and goals into practice, being truly the only area \r\nof human existence to have achieved what is known \r\nhas promoted sports policies to consolidate the values \r\nI have mentioned and to employ the energies of youth \r\nin fruitful activities that help to forge a national \r\nidentity, thereby contributing to the Sudan’s national \r\ndevelopment efforts, to the creation of an atmosphere \r\nof tolerance and understanding among nations and \r\npeoples, and to the promotion of the culture of peace. \r\nAgainst that backdrop and in that spirit, my delegation \r\nwould like to pay tribute to all the international bodies \r\nthat promote the role of sports across the globe.\r\nWe wish every success to the organizers of the XXII \r\nWinter Olympics, to be held next year in Sochi in the \r\nRussian Federation. My delegation also acknowledges \r\nthe establishment of the Russian International \r\nOlympic University in Sochi, which will be dedicated \r\nto promoting knowledge and lofty Olympic values, \r\nideals and traditions, including the activities of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee. The delegation of \r\nthe Sudan also welcomes the reference in the draft \r\nresolution to the use of sports to promote peace and \r\nreconciliation in conflict zones.\r\nIn conclusion, the delegation of the Sudan has \r\nsupported and co-sponsored the draft resolution before \r\nthe Assembly today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 64/3, of 19 October 2009, I \r\nnow give the f loor to the President of the International \r\nOlympic Committee.\r\nMr. Bach (International Olympic Committee) \r\n(spoke in French): The International Olympic Committee \r\n(IOC) presents its compliments to the General Assembly \r\nand is honoured to have the opportunity to address the \r\nAssembly today, just three months before the opening \r\nof the 2014 Olympic Games and Paralympic Games \r\nin Sochi, in the framework of the debate on the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Sport for peace and development: \r\nbuilding a peaceful and better world through sport and \r\nthe Olympic ideal” (A/68/L.8).\r\nI wish to thank all those who made it possible for \r\nus to be here today. The IOC expresses its most sincere \r\ngratitude to the Government of the Russian Federation \r\nand its representatives to the United Nations; to the \r\nSochi 2014 Organizing Committee and its president, \r\nMr. Dmitry Chernyshenko; to the Group of Friends of \r\nSport for Development and Peace; and to the United \r\nNations Special Adviser on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke. Once again, we ask for \r\nsupport for the Olympic Truce.\r\n13-54989 19/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nexample of mutual respect and non-discrimination. And \r\nit is always moving, not least for me as a former athlete, \r\nto see how, in the Olympic Village, young people from \r\nall parts of the world live together harmoniously and \r\npeacefully in one place. There the Olympic spirit is \r\nalive.\r\nBeyond that, Organizing Committees are \r\nincreasingly taking up the vision of the Olympic Truce. \r\nThe London 2012 programme offered young people in \r\nevery school and college across the United Kingdom a \r\nchance to take part in sporting and cultural activities, \r\nwhich helped encourage peace in their schools and \r\ncommunities.\r\nThe Sochi 2014 youth initiatives are also aimed \r\nat promoting peace, harmony and respect. As part of \r\nthat programme, the Sochi Organizing Committee \r\nis devoting a great deal of attention to working with \r\nyoung people all over Russia, as well as internationally, \r\nwhile drawing their attention to peace, tolerance and \r\nparticipation.\r\nGoing beyond the Games themselves, the IOC seeks \r\nto set examples of mutual understanding and solidarity. \r\nThrough the programmes run by Olympic Solidarity, \r\nthe International Sports Federation and the National \r\nOlympic Committees, we emphasize that striving for \r\npeace also requires sustainable development, solidarity \r\nand support. In the current Olympiad, the Olympic \r\nfamily is investing more than $600 million into putting \r\nthat solidarity into practice.\r\nPrecisely because many of our principles are \r\nthe same, it must always be clear in the relationship \r\nbetween sport and politics that the role of sport is \r\nalways to build bridges; it is never to build walls. Sport \r\nstands for dialogue and understanding, which transcend \r\nall differences. Sport, and the Olympic Movement \r\nespecially, understands the global diversity of cultures, \r\nsocieties and life designs as a source of richness. We \r\nnever accuse or exclude anyone.\r\nFor that reason, we oppose boycotts of any kind. \r\nBoycotts are a fundamental contradiction to the spirit \r\nof sport, depriving it of the means to continue working \r\nfor peace, mutual understanding and solidarity. This is \r\neven more true if sport is the sole instrument misused \r\nfor the boycott, while political, economic and cultural \r\nrelations continue as normal.\r\nIf the IOC and the United Nations stand side by \r\nside in this partnership, understood in this way, even \r\nin political philosophy as universal law and in moral \r\nphilosophy as a global ethic. Regardless of where in the \r\nworld we practise sport, the rules are the same. They are \r\nrecognized worldwide. They are based on a common \r\nglobal ethic of fair play, tolerance and friendship. \r\nBut to apply this universal law worldwide and spread \r\nour values globally, sport has to enjoy responsible \r\nautonomy. Politics must respect that sporting autonomy, \r\nfor only then can sport organizations implement those \r\nuniversal values amid all the differing laws, customs \r\nand traditions.\r\nResponsible autonomy does not mean that sport \r\nshould operate in a law-free environment. It does mean \r\nthat we respect national laws that are not targeted \r\nagainst sport and its organizations alone, sometimes for \r\nchiefly political reasons.\r\nIn many States Members of the United Nations, the \r\nfact that sport can hold its international competitions \r\nand promote its values only if enjoying autonomy is not \r\nalways understood or accepted. For that reason, I ask \r\nmembers to take this message back to their countries: \r\nin the mutual interests of both sport and politics, please \r\nhelp to protect and strengthen the autonomy of sport. \r\nOnly in that way can we create the win-win situation \r\nof a fruitful partnership for the benefit of youth and \r\nsociety in general.\r\nNaturally, that means that sport, too, must live up to \r\nits responsibilities. Our partners in politics, whom we \r\nexpect to respect our autonomy, are entitled to expect \r\nthat we exercise that autonomy responsibly, and in \r\naccordance with the rules of good governance. The IOC \r\nsets an example in that regard. We want the Universal \r\nPrinciples of Good Governance of the Olympic \r\nMovement to be accepted as a minimum standard and \r\nimplemented at all levels of sport.\r\nWithin that partnership, sport must remain \r\npolitically neutral. That does not mean that sport is \r\napolitical. Sport must include political considerations \r\nin its decisions. It must also consider the political, \r\neconomic and social implications of its decisions. \r\nThat is true in particular when choosing the venues for \r\nmajor sports events — above all, of the largest and most \r\nimportant of those, the Olympic Games.\r\nWith the Olympic Games, the IOC sets an example \r\nof peaceful interaction. The Olympic Games, the \r\nOlympic athletes and in particular the Olympic Village \r\nare a powerful symbol of that. They break down the \r\nbarriers of cultural differences. They serve as an \r\n20/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\nsymbols, and in particular the peaceful competition at \r\nthe Olympic Games, should inspire all people. They \r\nshould show that rivalries and disputes can be resolved \r\npeacefully. They should show that people can transcend \r\nall boundaries by agreeing on universal rules to govern \r\nhuman competition and resolve conflicts. For that \r\nreason, the Olympic Truce is of particular significance. \r\nWe set great store by that common endeavour, which is \r\nsuch a splendid example of how, through partnership, \r\npolitics and sport can complement each other.\r\nWe are grateful to the General Assembly and the \r\nSecretary-General for the fruitful cooperation that \r\nhas been built on trust. Together with the political \r\nauthorities, the IOC wishes to set an example for peace \r\nand solidarity in the quest for a more humane society. \r\nOur partnership clearly illustrates that Olympic \r\nprinciples are United Nations principles. Let us work \r\ntogether to make those universal principles a reality,\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 11.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.8.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the vote, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): Sporting events, and \r\nabove all the Olympic Games, provide us with a unique \r\nopportunity to celebrate the supremacy of peace over \r\nconflict and the pre-eminence of friendship over \r\nhostility. The peaceful spirit and ritual in which the \r\nGames were held in ancient Greece 28 centuries ago \r\nstill inspire and encourage all countries to be part \r\nof such a special experience every four years. They \r\ncontribute to an atmosphere of tolerance, solidarity and \r\nconfidence among different peoples and nations.\r\nIt is precisely that noble character of the Olympic \r\nGames that explains our decision today not to \r\nundermine the consensual nature of the draft resolution \r\n(A/68/L.8) introduced today. Yet, while we all have \r\nonce again reaffirmed our willingness to further the \r\nrole of sport in building a peaceful and safe world, we \r\nneed to acknowledge that, unfortunately, reality often \r\ncasts a shadow on our declared aspirations. Not only is \r\nthe very notion of the Olympic Truce being distorted, \r\nthe Olympics are also being used to divert attention \r\nmore fruitful cooperation is possible, in particular in \r\nthe areas of education, development, integration and \r\nefforts for peace.\r\nSport is not just physical activity; it promotes health \r\nand helps prevent, or even cure, the diseases of modern \r\ncivilization. It is also an educational tool that fosters \r\ncognitive development, teaches social behaviour and \r\nhelps to integrate communities. For that reason, we offer \r\neven more intensive dialogue with the United Nations \r\nand its agencies, in particular UNESCO. Education and \r\nlearning are the keys to the future of all our societies.\r\nMens sana in corpore sano. That old Latin phrase \r\nputs the idea in a nutshell — a healthy mind in a healthy \r\nbody. I therefore plead for the educational asset that \r\nsport represents and that the teaching of values through \r\nsport be included in school curriculums all over the \r\nworld. Both our organizations feel obliged to help \r\nyoung people enjoy a better future. The IOC therefore \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s United Nations youth \r\nstrategy and the appointment of the Envoy on Youth. \r\nWe are thankful for the contribution of United Nations \r\nagencies to the Culture and Education Programme at \r\nthe Youth Olympic Games.\r\nIn order to work together even more closely, we \r\nsuggest enhancing our cooperation with respect to \r\nsport as an instrument for development and peace. \r\nWe applaud the General Assembly’s historic decision \r\nin August to establish the International Day of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace (resolution 67/296). In that \r\ncontext, the General Assembly recalled the IOC’s role \r\nin promoting healthy lifestyles and creating access to \r\nsport for as many people as possible. Sport promotes \r\nintegration; it boosts self-esteem and joie de vivre, \r\nwhich can play an important role in the integration \r\nof societies, including in crisis areas, where the IOC \r\nworks with humanitarian and development agencies. \r\nWe are prepared to do even more. The integrative power \r\nof sport can work its magic in crisis areas, helping to \r\nbuild understanding and reconciliation while, at the \r\nsame time, improving quality of life.\r\nAll such measures can be ways to build a better and \r\nmore peaceful world. We know, of course, that, as in \r\nancient Greece, sport and the Olympic Games cannot \r\non their own solve political problems or achieve peace. \r\nPeacebuilding is a long process. Sport wants to be part of \r\nthat process. We are aware of our limits, but we want to \r\nuse the power of our values and symbols to promote the \r\npositive, peaceful development of global society. Those \r\n13-54989 21/22\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.44\r\nHowever, despite the difficult political context \r\nand notwithstanding the destabilizing process and \r\nprovocative acts illustrated heretofore, Georgia remains \r\nfully committed to its peaceful and constructive \r\napproach, the spirit of the present draft resolution and \r\nthe common international interest. We are therefore not \r\ngoing to break the consensus and remain in favour of \r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the only speaker in explanation of vote before the \r\nvoting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.8, entitled “Sport for peace and \r\ndevelopment: building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin document A/68/L.8, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Argentina, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, \r\nBenin, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, \r\nthe Czech Republic, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, Ethiopia, Haiti, \r\nIceland, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Jamaica, \r\nJordan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liechtenstein, \r\nLithuania, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mexico, Myanmar, \r\nNepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Saint Lucia, Samoa, San Marino, Seychelles, \r\nthe Sudan, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkmenistan, \r\nUkraine, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam and Zimbabwe.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.8?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 68/9).\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the representative \r\nof Brazil.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): As the first \r\ncountry to sponsor the text contained in resolution 66/5, \r\n“Sport for peace and development: building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal,” \r\nfrom acts of violence and military aggression and veil \r\nabuses and violations of human rights and freedoms.\r\nWhile we are looking forward to once again \r\nreviving the Olympic Truce, we need to remember \r\nthat only 40 kilometres from Sochi, an occupation is \r\ntaking place; indeed, the country hosting the Games \r\ncontinues to occupy 20 per cent of Georgia’s sovereign \r\nterritory in violation of the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of my country. In addition, while in the \r\ndraft resolution we recognize that the Olympic Truce \r\nprovides humanitarian opportunities, it is important to \r\nconsider that, in fact, the occupied regions of Georgia \r\nare still blocked for humanitarian access and the local \r\npopulation is deprived of humanitarian assistance.\r\nDespite the crucial political, security and \r\nhumanitarian context, the Government of Georgia \r\nopted for the depoliticization of the Olympics, the \r\nidea of which is founded on peace and should lead to \r\ncooperation. In October 2012, the new Government of \r\nGeorgia made a difficult decision to stop boycotting \r\nthe Sochi Olympics. Furthermore, that decision showed \r\nthe Government of Georgia’s willingness to de-escalate \r\nthe existing crisis between Russia and Georgia and \r\nnormalize relations in humanitarian or people-to-\r\npeople spheres.\r\nUnfortunately, in January 2013, shortly after the \r\ndeclaration of Georgia’s constructive decision, the \r\noccupation forces began the large-scale installation \r\nof barbed-wire fences and embankments along the \r\noccupation line in the Tskhinvali and Abkhazia regions \r\nof Georgia. Those illegal activities significantly affect \r\nthe livelihoods of the local population, divide families \r\nand communities, prevent people-to-people contacts, \r\nand deprive the people of their fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms. We hope that the installation of the \r\naforementioned artificial obstacles will not be resumed \r\nand will be reversed.\r\nWe further regret that, in response to the \r\nGovernment of Georgia’s demonstration of goodwill, \r\nMoscow decided to use the Olympic Games for \r\npolitical purposes and opted for still more provocative \r\nacts, including naming “the August war hero”, pilot \r\nIvan Nechaev — so called because of his excellence \r\nin bombing Georgian villages — one of the Olympic \r\ntorchbearers. Such a politicized approach totally \r\ndisregards and contradicts the genesis of the draft \r\nresolution.\r\n22/22 13-54989\r\nA/68/PV.44 06/11/2013\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): One \r\nrepresentative has asked to speak in exercise of the \r\nright of reply. I would remind him that, in accordance \r\nwith General Assembly decision 34/401, statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention and to five minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We are compelled to exercise our right to \r\nreply to the statement made by Georgia. Only a few \r\nminutes ago, the President of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee (IOC) said that we should refrain from the \r\npolitical exploitation of sports. Unfortunately, that \r\nappeal was not heard by the delegation of Georgia. \r\nWe regret that even as we discuss the theme of the \r\nOlympic Truce, which is by definition is a uniter of \r\npeople, the Georgian delegation could not refrain from \r\nits habitual attacks on Russia. That may be explained \r\nby the fact that it was Georgia itself that, on the eve of \r\nthe Beijing Olympic Games in 2008, launched an attack \r\non the people of South Ossetia and even on Russian \r\npeacekeepers. \r\nNow, instead of showing the political will and desire \r\nto normalize the situation in the region, and instead of \r\nusing this unique opportunity to show its respect for the \r\ntradition of the Olympic Truce, the Georgian delegation \r\nhas once again resorted to fabricated reasons for \r\nunjustified accusations against the Russian Federation. \r\nWe repudiate all of them. The Russian Federation has \r\nalways followed the ideals and principles of the Olympic \r\nCharter and has strictly followed the rules of the IOC \r\nregulating the organization of the Olympic Games.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to stress that, despite \r\nGeorgia’s attempts to wage political battle against the \r\nSochi Olympic Games, its athletes and fans will be \r\nreceived in Sochi with all the respect that they deserve.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 11.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.25 p.m.\r\nadopted by consensus in October 2011, and adopted \r\nonce again here today in resolution 68/9, Brazil is \r\ncommitted to the promotion of sports as an instrument \r\nfor development and peace. Sports are deeply rooted \r\nin Brazilian culture and society, and our Constitution \r\nrecognizes its practice as a fundamental social right.\r\nWe find ourselves at the beginning of a sports-\r\ncentred decade. In the next few years, Brazil will \r\nhost important mega-events: the World Cup of the \r\nInternational Federation of Association Football, in \r\n2014, and the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016. \r\nThe decision to host those events took into account not \r\nonly their positive impact on disseminating the Olympic \r\nideals throughout Brazilian society, particularly \r\namong youth, but also the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and social inclusiveness. The preparation \r\nprocess for those events includes sensitizing and \r\neducating the public on the need to promote diversity \r\nand to combat racism and discrimination. \r\nAt the twenty-fourth session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in September, Brazil was a member of the \r\ncore group that presented resolution 24/1, entitled \r\n“Promoting human rights through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal”, adopted by consensus with more than \r\n130 sponsors. The resolution recognizes sport as a \r\nuniversal language that can help educate people on the \r\nvalues of respect, diversity, tolerance and fairness. It is \r\nan important tool in the fight against discrimination of \r\nany kind.\r\nBrazil is a strong advocate for Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 17/19 on human rights, sexual \r\norientation and gender identity, and an active member \r\nof the LGBT core group at the United Nations. In \r\nSeptember, Brazil took a decisive stand in support of \r\nthe joint ministerial declaration on ending violence \r\nand discrimination against individuals based on their \r\nsexual orientation and gender identity. In the spirit of \r\nbuilding a peaceful world through sports and without \r\ndiscrimination, we will welcome the world to our \r\ncountry as host of the 2014 soccer World Cup and the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.\r\n"
