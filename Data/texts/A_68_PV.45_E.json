"In the absence of the President, Mr. Sinhaseni \r\n(Thailand), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 88 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary General transmitting \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/68/324)\r\nDraft resolution (A/68/L.10)\r\nMr. Khazaee (Islamic Republic of Iran): This is \r\na new experience for me here, and I appreciate it very \r\nmuch. Let me first thank you, Sir. I would like to \r\nexpress my thanks to Director General Amano for his \r\nreport (see A/68/PV,43).\r\nAs a cost-effective, environmentally friendly \r\nand climatically benign source of energy, nuclear \r\ntechnology has gained a prominent position in the \r\nsustainable development of nations, in particular in \r\nthe industrial, medical and agricultural fields and \r\nin producing electricity. The inalienable right to \r\ndevelop, research, produce and use nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes without discrimination, including \r\nthe inherent right to develop a full national nuclear \r\nfuel cycle for peaceful purposes, is the very foundation \r\nand one of the fundamental pillars of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Those \r\ninherent rights can never be suspended or restricted.\r\nAccording to article IV of the NPT, not only shall \r\nnothing in the Treaty be interpreted as affecting those \r\nrights, but all parties have a firm legal obligation\r\n“to facilitate, and have the right to participate in, the \r\nfullest possible exchange of equipment, materials \r\nand scientific and technological information for the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy”.\r\nFurthermore, in accordance with article III, paragraph 3, \r\neven the required safeguards\r\n“shall be implemented in a manner designed \r\nto comply with Article IV of this Treaty, and to \r\navoid hampering the economic or technological \r\ndevelopment of the Parties or international \r\nco-operation in the field of peaceful nuclear \r\nactivities, including the international exchange of \r\nnuclear material and equipment for the processing, \r\nuse or production of nuclear material for peaceful \r\npurposes”.\r\nLikewise, according to articles II and III of the \r\nStatute of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), the Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge \r\nthe contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and \r\nprosperity throughout the world. It shall also foster \r\nthe exchange of scientific and technical information \r\nand assist research on, and development and practical \r\napplication of, atomic energy for peaceful uses.\r\nAccordingly, along with other statutory functions \r\nof the Agency, to assist member States in research on, \r\nand development and practical application of, nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful uses is its primary responsibility. \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.45\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n45th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 6 November 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We will continue this approach at the new \r\nround of negotiations with the Agency. We stand ready \r\nto make the upcoming negotiations a success. Based on \r\nour new approach, we will continue our constructive \r\nengagement with the parties concerned, in particular \r\nthe group made up of the five permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council plus Germany.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to resolve \r\nall outstanding issues through meaningful, time-bound \r\nand results-oriented negotiations. The adoption of \r\na win-win approach is essential to ensuring that \r\nnegotiations will result in the removal of the legitimate \r\nconcerns of the other parties and the acknowledgement \r\nof the inherent right of Iran to peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy, including to develop a full national nuclear fuel \r\ncycle, and the lifting of all multilateral and unilateral \r\nsanctions. Through its constructive engagement and by \r\npresenting practical proposals, Iran has demonstrated \r\nthe seriousness of its desire to solve the outstanding \r\nissues once and for all. Therefore, the other parties \r\nshould prove their genuine political will by seizing this \r\nopportunity.\r\nMr. Back (Australia): Australia is pleased to have \r\nthe opportunity to commend Director General Yukiya \r\nAmano for his briefing on the achievements of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the \r\nchallenges that it will face over the coming years (see \r\nA/68/PV.43). We congratulate the Director General on \r\nhis election to a new term in that most important role. \r\nAustralia is honoured to a member of the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors and a non-permanent member \r\nof the Security Council for 2013-2014. We take very \r\nseriously the responsibilities that that entails. Australia \r\nattaches great importance to the central role played \r\nby the IAEA in improving the safety and security \r\nof nuclear activities, enlarging the humanitarian \r\ncontribution of nuclear technology and verifying \r\nStates’ non-proliferation commitments.\r\nAustralia fully supports the right of IAEA member \r\nStates to enjoy the benefits of the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy in accordance with their international \r\nobligations. All States members of the Agency must \r\nwork together to ensure an effective safeguards system. \r\nConfidence in that system provides the necessary \r\nassurances about the peaceful nature of nuclear \r\nactivities and is the basic foundation for nuclear trade \r\nand cooperation, security and continuing progress on \r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nWe believe that this role of the IAEA should be further \r\npromoted. The IAEA should be allowed to work \r\nimpartially and professionally. That is necessary for \r\npreserving the authority, efficiency and credibility of \r\nthe IAEA and the continued relevance and credibility \r\nof the NPT.\r\nIn exercising its inalienable right to the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, Iran is committed to its legal \r\nobligations. The Islamic Republic of Iran’s nuclear \r\nactivities are, and have always been, exclusively for \r\npeaceful purposes. Iran continues to cooperate with \r\nthe IAEA. All activities in the Iranian nuclear sites are \r\nunder the 24-hour surveillance cameras of the Agency. \r\nIn addition, the resident inspectors of the IAEA regularly \r\nvisit those sites and measure and seal enriched uranium \r\ncontainers. The Agency’s inspectors have carried \r\nout over 8,000 person-days of inspection in Iranian \r\nfacilities, including 100 unannounced inspections. \r\nSuch an inspections record is unprecedented in the \r\nhistory of the Agency.\r\nBased on the most recent IAEA safeguards \r\nimplementation report, just in 2012, Iran dispatched \r\nwithout delay over 4,000 accounting reports to \r\nthe Agency. On many occasions, as trust and \r\nconfidence-building measures, Iran has cooperated \r\nwith the Agency well beyond its legal obligations. As \r\na result, the non-diversion of declared nuclear material \r\nin Iran has always been confirmed by all IAEA reports, \r\nincluding its most recent report, dated 28 August 2013.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is determined to \r\ncontinue its cooperation with the Agency based on \r\nits Safeguards Agreement. According to the joint \r\nstatement by IAEA and the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nissued following the recent talks at IAEA headquarters \r\nin Vienna,\r\n“delegations of the Agency and the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran had a very productive meeting covering past \r\nand present issues on the 28 and 29 of October here \r\nin Vienna;\r\n“Iran presented a new proposal on practical \r\nmeasures as a constructive contribution to \r\nstrengthen cooperation and dialogue with a view to \r\nfuture resolution of all outstanding issues;\r\n“Following the substantive discussions it \r\nwas decided that a further meeting will be held \r\non 11 November in Tehran in order to take this \r\ncooperation forward.”\r\n13-54995 3/13\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.45\r\nKazakhstan notes with great satisfaction its \r\ncollaboration with the IAEA on its own nuclear energy, \r\nas well as on non-proliferation and disarmament \r\npolicies at the regional and global levels. The Agency \r\nnot only protects us from nuclear weapons and nuclear \r\nterrorism but also advances human betterment through \r\npeaceful purposes. To achieve that, it is important to \r\nbring international legal norms into line with the reality \r\nof de facto nuclear-weapon States.\r\nAt the same time, the greatest risks are associated \r\nwith States that are involved in the black market in \r\nnuclear technologies. Compliance with the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons by State \r\nparties and the improvement of global mechanisms \r\nfor managing processes in the development of nuclear \r\npower and the safety of nuclear facilities are therefore \r\nof extreme importance. My country therefore proposes \r\nconducting regular stress tests of nuclear plants \r\nand protection systems and developing rapid rescue \r\nresponses under the auspices of the IAEA.\r\nTo harness nuclear capabilities for peaceful \r\npurposes, my country collaborates with the Russian \r\nFederation on making our uranium available for \r\nenrichment at the National Nuclear Centre in Angarsk, \r\nSiberia, for use as nuclear fuel in power reactors. We \r\nare also working developing the Kurchatov Nuclear \r\nTechnology Park under IAEA surveillance.\r\nWe support the IAEA initiative to develop a new \r\nnon-political and non-discriminatory framework \r\nfor utilizing nuclear energy based on multilateral \r\napproaches to the nuclear energy fuel cycle. Kazakhstan \r\nis currently finalizing negotiations with the IAEA on \r\nhosting a nuclear fuel bank on its territory.\r\nBeing part of the Central Asian Nuclear \r\nWeapon-Free Zone, Kazakhstan strictly abides by the \r\nIAEA safeguards agreement. We also adhere to the \r\nadditional protocol in order to reduce the risk of nuclear \r\nterrorism and the smuggling of nuclear weapons and \r\nradioactive materials in the region. We collaborate \r\nwith the IAEA in order to address the environmental \r\nconcerns of ecological radiation specific to Central \r\nAsia, as we are currently doing for north-east Japan. \r\nMy delegation endorses the IAEA road map proposed \r\nat its most recent ministerial meeting.\r\nKazakhstan supports the establishment of a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East as a \r\nsolution that supports peace in the region and therefore \r\ncommends the work of the IAEA towards that objective. \r\nAustralia welcomes the Director General’s efforts \r\nto improve the effectiveness of the safeguards system, \r\nincluding in relation to the conceptualization and \r\ndevelopment of safeguards implementation at the State \r\nlevel. Australia urges all States yet to do so to bring into \r\nforce an additional protocol as soon as possible as an \r\nessential step in ensuring the maximum effectiveness \r\nof the safeguards system. As Director General Amano \r\nreminded us in July, constant vigilance and collective \r\naction are necessary to ensure nuclear security. This \r\nyear, we were pleased to note that the Agency and \r\nmember States continued along that path. Australia also \r\nacknowledges the Agency’s efforts in implementing the \r\nIAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety, including a series \r\nof international experts meetings on topics central \r\nto understanding the causes and consequences of the \r\nFukushima nuclear accident.\r\nWe strongly support the efforts of the contracting \r\nparties to identify suitable options to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the Convention on Nuclear Safety, \r\nwhich is the principal international instrument for \r\npromoting the safety of nuclear power reactors. We also \r\nsupport the Agency’s continued efforts to strengthen the \r\nsafety and security of radioactive sources, highlighted \r\nas recently as last week at the Agency’s conference on \r\nthat subject in the United Arab Emirates.\r\nIn conclusion, the external environment in which \r\nthe Agency operates is highly f luid. The Agency must \r\nmaintain the capacity to respond quickly and effectively \r\nto external developments be they related to nuclear \r\nsafety, physical protection, nuclear proliferation or \r\nsustainable development. Australia will continue to \r\nsupport Director General Amano’s efforts to strengthen \r\nthe contribution the Agency in promoting the use of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes in areas ranging \r\nfrom cancer treatment to water resources and to the \r\ncause of international peace and security.\r\nAustralia is pleased to co-sponsor and support the \r\ndraft resolution on the report of the IAEA (A/68/L.10).\r\nMr. Tilegen (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan wishes to \r\nexpress its warm appreciation to Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for introducing a most comprehensive \r\nanalysis of the work of the Agency (see A/68/PV.43). \r\nIt highlights the current and future roles of the IAEA \r\nin pointing the way for applications of nuclear energy \r\nand technical cooperation, with a stronger focus also \r\non safety and security measures rather than purely \r\nverification.\r\n4/13 13-54995\r\nA/68/PV.45 06/11/2013\r\nTests and in the Nuclear Discussion Forum, initiated by \r\nKazakhstan together with the EastWest Institute.\r\nIn conclusion, we look forward to another cycle \r\nof even more productive collaboration with the IAEA \r\nto address global issues of nuclear technology and \r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): My delegation joins \r\nothers in thanking Director General Yukiya Amano \r\nfor his introduction of the 2012 annual report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (see \r\nA/68/324). Also allow me to congratulate Director \r\nGeneral Amano on being elected for a second four-year \r\nterm, a reflection of the confidence placed in him by \r\nmembers of the organization.\r\nJamaica attaches great importance to the vital work \r\nof the IAEA in fostering nuclear safety and security \r\nand promoting peaceful uses of nuclear technology. \r\nThe Agency’s practical and meaningful technical \r\ncooperation projects are greatly appreciated by my \r\ncountry and many small developing member States.\r\nIt is in the promotion of peaceful uses of technology \r\nto help improve the lives of people that Jamaica finds \r\nits relations with the IAEA to be the most significant. \r\nWe have a strong interest in IAEA activities related to \r\nnuclear science, technology and applications, and we \r\ncontinue to benefit significantly from them.\r\nJamaica became a State party to the Regional \r\nCooperative Agreement for the Promotion of Nuclear \r\nScience and Technology in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean in November 2011 and attaches great \r\nimportance to its cooperation through that regional \r\nmechanism.\r\nWe are pleased that the IAEA has been taking steps \r\nto deepen its collaboration with the Caribbean. That \r\nhas no doubt contributed to the fact that a Caribbean \r\ncountry has been among the group of new members \r\nadmitted in each of the last three General Conferences. \r\nThose three are Dominica, Trinidad and Tobago, and \r\nthe Bahamas. Jamaica welcomes the IAEA’s increasing \r\nefforts to collaborate with our subregion and continues \r\nto take tangible steps to support those efforts through a \r\nnumber of initiatives, including through the co-hosting \r\nof subregional workshops.\r\nJamaica has benefited from projects in several \r\nareas and is actively engaged with the Department of \r\nTechnical Cooperation, Division for Latin America, in \r\ndeveloping projects in areas of high national importance, \r\nKazakhstan is ready to host any future deliberations to \r\nmove the process forward.\r\nWe are consistently implementing the International \r\nConvention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear \r\nTerrorism and Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) \r\nin order to strengthen measures to combat the illegal \r\ntrafficking of nuclear and other materials. In 2011, \r\nwith the support of the United Nations Office for \r\nDisarmament Affairs and the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe, we hosted a training \r\nworkshop under Security Council resolution 1540 \r\n(2004) for 30 experts from the Central Asian region, \r\nfunded by the Governments of Norway and the United \r\nStates of America. We are currently viewing prospects \r\nfor a similar training workshop in early 2014. \r\nAs a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and \r\nthe Zangger Committee, Kazakhstan maintains the \r\nstrictest control over its equipment and installations \r\nthat enrich uranium and reprocess spent nuclear fuel. \r\nIt is diligently implementing the recommendations of \r\nthe first and second Nuclear Security Summits, held \r\nin Washington, D.C., in April 2010 and in Seoul in \r\n2012, respectively, and looks forward to The Hague \r\nSummit in 2014. My country has ratified and acceded \r\nto four major conventions of nuclear security, including \r\nthe Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear \r\nDamage.\r\nIn view of the growing importance of nuclear \r\nenergy, Kazakhstan has entered into an agreement with \r\nthe IAEA on technical cooperation for 2010-2015 to \r\ndevelop nuclear energy for nuclear education, medicine \r\nand agriculture, research reactor safety, nuclear \r\ntechnology and radioisotope and radiation applications \r\nfor collective global human security.\r\nAn issue of great importance to us is that \r\nKazakhstan, though a key and responsible member \r\nof the IAEA, is being denied the opportunity to \r\nparticipate in the work of elective bodies because of the \r\nrules of procedure currently in place. Kazakhstan fully \r\nsupports the early entry into force of the amendments \r\nto article VI of the IAEA Statute, and we are confident \r\nthat a solution will be found. I would like to state that \r\nKazakhstan contributes regularly to the IAEA budget \r\nand the Technical Cooperation Fund in fulfilment of its \r\nfinancial obligations.\r\nWe thank the IAEA for its collaboration in the \r\nobservance of the International Day against Nuclear \r\n13-54995 5/13\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.45\r\nall members to ensure that their nuclear programmes \r\nare brought under the appropriate safeguards regime.\r\nWe remain supportive of actions to improve nuclear \r\nsecurity, given the lethal and devastating impact \r\nthat a nuclear disaster can have on our viability and \r\nsurvival. For our part, we acceded to the Convention \r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Materials in 2005 \r\nand have signed the International Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\r\nWe continue to be disturbed at the frequent reports \r\non the loss of nuclear materials. We therefore support \r\nthe efforts of the IAEA Illicit Trafficking Database, \r\nwhich records and analyses incidents involving nuclear \r\nand other radioactive material in an attempt to identify \r\ntrends and/or characteristics to assist in the prevention \r\nof the misuse of nuclear or radioactive material.\r\nIn conclusion, Jamaica is confident that the \r\nvaluable and practical cooperation that it has enjoyed \r\nwith the IAEA will continue and that the fruits of that \r\ncooperation will redound to the benefit of all. We remain \r\ndeeply committed to the goals of this important Agency \r\nand will do our part to ensure that nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity goals are maintained and strengthened through \r\ncompliance with the agreements and mechanisms on \r\nwhich we are agreed.\r\nMr. Langeland (Norway): Norway is pleased to \r\nbe among the sponsors draft resolution A/68/L.10, on \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) (see A/68/324).\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation are a \r\ncornerstone of Norwegian foreign policy. We place the \r\nutmost importance on the universalization of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\nWe therefore call upon States that have not yet done so \r\nto join the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. The \r\nIAEA plays a crucial role in sustaining the regime, \r\nwhich is essential for international peace and security \r\nand in moving forward towards our collective objective \r\nof a world without nuclear weapons.\r\nNorway reiterates its call for the full universal \r\napplication of the comprehensive safeguards agreement \r\nand the additional protocol and stresses the need to \r\nresolve all cases of non-compliance. We are deeply \r\nconcerned about the prolonged and grave challenges \r\nto the non-proliferation regime posed by the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nin particular health and water resources management. \r\nThe project in health complements the initiatives that \r\nJamaica and sister Caribbean Community States have \r\nspearheaded in the United Nations and the World Health \r\nOrganization to address the grave challenges posed by \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs). Our efforts are \r\nfocused on both prevention and cure. With regard to \r\nthe latter, we consider the use of nuclear medicine to \r\nbe critical. The support of the IAEA for our efforts \r\nto re-establish a nuclear medicine capacity for the \r\nmanagement of NCDs, including cardiac diseases and \r\ncancers, is therefore of vital importance.\r\nIn recognition of the value and importance of the \r\ncooperation projects being undertaken with the support \r\nof the IAEA, we have taken steps to meet our current \r\nobligations in relation to the technical cooperation \r\nagreements. We will make further efforts to meet \r\nour obligations in that area, despite serious resource \r\nchallenges.\r\nIn the field of research and technology, we are now \r\nembarked on the conversion of our reactor from highly \r\nenriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium \r\n(LEU). We express appreciation to the IAEA and the \r\nGovernment of the United States for the assistance \r\nthat is being given to Jamaica, in particular under the \r\nPeaceful Uses Initiative. In fact, we are embarked on a \r\nproject, in partnership with the IAEA and the United \r\nStates, aimed at converting the fuel used in our nuclear \r\nresearch reactor from HEU to LEU.\r\nNuclear technology is perhaps the most sensitive \r\nfield of human technological activity. The benefits and \r\ndangers associated with the harnessing of the awesome \r\npower of the atom require careful study, safety and \r\nsecurity protocols and measures, as well as constant \r\nvigilance.\r\nIn the area of nuclear security, compliance by all \r\nmembers of the international community with treaties \r\nand mechanisms that govern the development and use of \r\nnuclear material is most important. We look forward to \r\nthe elimination of all nuclear weapons and the securing \r\nof a world free of all nuclear weapons. In the meantime, \r\nwe resolutely oppose any expansion in the number of \r\nStates developing or possessing nuclear weapons. It \r\nis for those reasons that we regard the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), and \r\ncompliance with it, to be of paramount importance. We \r\nshare the expressions of concern that have been voiced \r\nregarding the failure of certain members to comply with \r\ntheir obligations under the NPT, and we therefore urge \r\n6/13 13-54995\r\nA/68/PV.45 06/11/2013\r\nis an important partner as we intensify our efforts to \r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nFukushima reminded us once again that tragic \r\naccidents occur and that their effects transcend borders. \r\nWe all have a stake in improving nuclear safety. \r\nOver the past year, Norway has contributed and will \r\ncontinue to contribute substantial financial resources \r\nto the IAEA Action Plan for Nuclear Safety, including \r\nfor the Agency’s work to strengthen safety capacity in \r\ndeveloping countries that are embarking on nuclear \r\npower programmes or have existing programmes. In \r\naddition to improving nuclear safety, we must also do \r\nmore in emergency preparedness and response.\r\nTo conclude, the IAEA remains an indispensable \r\npartner for our common security and development. We \r\nmust provide the Agency with the necessary political \r\nsupport and ensure it is fully equipped to meet current \r\nand emerging challenges.\r\nMr. Kebret (Ethiopia): It gives me great pleasure to \r\naddress this Assembly on behalf of my delegation on the \r\nagenda item under consideration. My delegation would \r\nlike to thank the Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nfor introducing the Agency’s informative and \r\ncomprehensive report (see A/68/324), which details the \r\nAgency’s activities during the past year in the areas \r\nof nuclear technology, safety and security, nuclear \r\nverification and technical cooperation, inter alia. We \r\nalso wish to congratulate Mr. Amano on his well-\r\ndeserved re-election.\r\nEthiopia joins other delegations in welcoming the \r\nBahamas, Brunei Darussalam and Swaziland as new \r\nIAEA member States as of this year. We consider \r\ntheir decision to be another positive indication of the \r\nimportance of the work of the IAEA.\r\nMy delegation commends the IAEA for its continued \r\nefforts in discharging its responsibilities to help member \r\nStates use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. The \r\nIAEA technical cooperation programme, including the \r\nprovision of guidance to member States in the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, is of critical importance. In that \r\nregard, the development of nuclear power projects and \r\nthe promotion of the application of nuclear technology \r\nto the service of human health, medical service, food \r\nand agriculture and environmental protection are worth \r\nmentioning.\r\nWe also believe that national measures and \r\ninternational cooperation are equally essential for \r\nThe IAEA must be given sufficient resources to \r\nkeep its safeguards capabilities strong and independent \r\nand to be able to evolve safeguards in the light of new \r\nchallenges and technologies. Norway has therefore \r\nbeen supporting the IAEA in developing the State-level \r\nconcept in the implementation of safeguards and \r\nconsiders it as an objective, efficient and effective \r\nmeasure in that regard. Norway supports multilateral \r\napproaches to the nuclear fuel cycle and appreciates \r\nthe contribution by the Agency in setting up the low \r\nenriched uranium fuel bank in Kazakhstan. Norway, \r\nfurthermore, values the contribution by the Agency in \r\nresolving current outstanding proliferation concerns. \r\nNorway will contribute financially to strengthening \r\nIAEA capabilities in those activities.\r\nThe IAEA is the keystone of international nuclear \r\nsecurity cooperation. We welcome the International \r\nConference on Nuclear Security: Enhancing Global \r\nEfforts, organized by the Agency in July. Effective \r\nphysical protection is crucial to preventing nuclear \r\nmaterial from falling into the hands of terrorists and \r\nto protecting nuclear facilities against unauthorized \r\nuse and malicious acts. We therefore urge all States that \r\nhave not done so to become party to the Convention on \r\nthe Physical Protection of Nuclear Material and its 2005 \r\nAmendment.\r\nAt the same time, we must recognize that other \r\nmultilateral efforts, such as the Nuclear Security \r\nSummit process, the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004) and the Global \r\nInitiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism are essential to \r\nprevent nuclear weapons or sensitive nuclear material \r\nfrom falling into the wrong hands. Those efforts are \r\nmutually reinforcing.\r\nNorway has devoted particular attention to \r\nminimizing the use of highly enriched uranium and \r\ngreatly appreciates its excellent cooperation with \r\nthe Agency in this field. My country has contributed \r\nsubstantial voluntary funding to the IAEA Nuclear \r\nSecurity Fund.\r\nNorway fully supports the right to peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, as stipulated by article IV of \r\nthe NPT. The purpose of multilateral fuel banks is \r\nindeed to promote that right, while sustaining the \r\nglobal non-proliferation regime. The application of \r\nnuclear technology involves far more than generating \r\nelectricity. The IAEA provides essential technical \r\nassistance in the use of nuclear technology in health \r\ncare, agriculture and water management. The Agency \r\n13-54995 7/13\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.45\r\ncrucial role as a means to transfer nuclear technology \r\nto developing countries.\r\nEthiopia has benefited from the joint activities of \r\nthe IAEA and the United Nations Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization in the application of nuclear techniques in \r\nthe fields of crop and livestock production, sustainable \r\ncontrol of major insect pests, soil degradation, and food \r\nquality and safety. Ethiopia views that as an important \r\ncontribution to helping developing countries to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, including, inter alia, \r\nthrough the improvement of agricultural productivity \r\nand childhood nutrition, poverty reduction, ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability and the development of \r\nglobal partnerships for development.\r\nIn closing, I wish to express my Government’s \r\nsincere gratitude to the IAEA, particularly its \r\ngoverning body and its leadership, for the vital \r\ntechnical support and continued cooperation that the \r\nAgency renders to my country. I would also to reiterate \r\nEthiopia’s commitment — in addition to abiding by its \r\ninternational obligations as a State party to the NPT \r\nand other disarmament conventions — to continuing to \r\ndo its level best to further enhance the positive spirit of \r\ncooperation with the Agency.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): I would like \r\nfirst to thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\nhis briefing on the Agency’s work and his report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly (see A/68/PV.43). \r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate the commitment \r\nof my Government to two aspects of the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy, an essential element to development. \r\nAs recalled by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II at \r\nthe opening of the Scientific Forum in September,\r\n“[t]here is no peace without development and, more \r\nspecifically, without sustainable development. That \r\nis the premise on which the IAEA was established \r\nas an organization of Atoms for Peace”.\r\nMonaco has been a member of the Agency since \r\nits inception in 1957 and has hosted the headquarters \r\nof its Marine Environment Laboratories since 1961. In \r\n2010, the activities of the Laboratories were expanded \r\nto the terrestrial environment, thereby becoming the \r\nIAEA Environment Laboratories. As stated by the \r\nDirector General, Monaco is also the host of the Ocean \r\nAcidification International Coordination Centre, \r\ncreated in 2012 in the context of the IAEA Peaceful Uses \r\nInitiative, launched by the United States of America. \r\nnuclear and radiation safety. We would like to underline \r\nthat the Agency has a key role to play in ensuring that \r\nsafeguards to address nuclear accidents are strictly \r\nimplemented, and that the global nuclear safety culture \r\nis promoted in a comprehensive and sustainable manner. \r\nThat is because we believe that the Agency’s safeguards \r\nare fundamental to creating an environment conducive \r\nto international nuclear energy cooperation in reducing \r\nthe possibilities of dangerous radioactive leaks through \r\nhuman error or for technical reasons.\r\nI would like to reaffirm the commitment of \r\nEthiopia, as one of the Agency’s founding members, \r\nto practising the peaceful use of nuclear technologies \r\nby respecting global and regional security monitoring \r\nand safeguarding mechanisms. In that regard, the \r\nGovernment of Ethiopia is committed to strengthening \r\nthe national radiation and nuclear safety infrastructure \r\nto ensure the safe operation of equipment that uses \r\nradiation sources and other nuclear materials by \r\nadhering to the promotion of peaceful use of nuclear \r\napplications.\r\nThe Agency’s responsibilities for ensuring nuclear \r\ndisarmament under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) are universal, and States \r\nparties to treaties related to nuclear disarmament \r\nand weapons of mass destruction also have equal \r\nresponsibility for halting the spread of nuclear weapons. \r\nIn particular, the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolutions 1540 (2004) and 1887 (2009) is essential to \r\nnuclear disarmament and to addressing nuclear-related \r\nthreats, including those posed by non-State actors who \r\nseek to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe Agency’s continued technical assistance to \r\nour Government’s efforts to develop capabilities in \r\nthe control of tsetse f lies, cancer treatment, diagnostic \r\nnuclear medicine services, isotope hydrological \r\nanalysis, non-destructive quality testing, and national \r\nnuclear science and technology infrastructure has been \r\nuseful in many ways. Indeed, we have improved our \r\ncapacity in several areas, in particular in manpower \r\ntraining, equipment acquisition and expert missions.\r\nEthiopia appreciates the Agency’s consistent \r\nand continued advocacy for peaceful use of nuclear \r\ntechnology. It believes that the provision of sufficient \r\nand predictable resources to the Agency’s programmes \r\nand, more importantly, a balanced distribution of \r\nresources among its safeguards, nuclear safety and \r\ntechnical cooperation activities need to be ensured. The \r\ntechnical cooperation programme is in fact playing a \r\n8/13 13-54995\r\nA/68/PV.45 06/11/2013\r\nIt is evident that such a partial and non-objective \r\napproach exposes the falsity of their allegations and \r\nof their declared interest in creating a region free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \r\nin the Middle East. Although they have supplied Israel \r\nfor decades with the nuclear technology and material \r\nthat have enabled it to possess nuclear weapons and \r\ntheir means of delivery, including advanced submarines \r\ncapable of carrying and launching nuclear weapons, they \r\ntried their best, though vainly, to remove those Israeli \r\nnuclear weapons from the main discussion during the \r\n2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\nfailed 2012 Helsinki conference. They did so in order \r\nto distract attention from Israel’s continuing possession \r\nof nuclear weapons to the detriment of the safety \r\nand security of the other peoples of the region. That \r\nunequivocally demonstrates their double standards.\r\nIn his statement yesterday (see A/68/PV.43), the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) stated that the Agency recently came \r\nto the conclusion that\r\n“it was very likely that a building destroyed at the \r\nDair Alzour site [in Syria] was a nuclear reactor \r\nthat should have been declared to the Agency”.\r\nIn this context, I would like to make the following \r\ncomments on that statement. \r\nFirst, the Director General knows that Syria made \r\nthe issue of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) a national priority in letter \r\nand spirit. In 1968, Syria became an early adherent \r\nto the NPT, and in 1992 it signed a Comprehensive \r\nSafeguards Agreement with the Agency. Moreover, \r\non 27 December 2003 Syria submitted, on behalf \r\nof the Arab Group, a draft resolution that is still in \r\nblue, circulating as an unofficial draft in the Security \r\nCouncil, aimed at creating a zone in the Middle East \r\nfree of nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. The credibility of our national commitment \r\nto non-proliferation cannot be questioned, particularly \r\nsince the text of the aforementioned draft resolution \r\nconforms to the provisions and goals of the IAEA. At the \r\ntime, as is well known, it was rejected by an influential \r\nnuclear-weapon State member of the Security Council \r\nthat threatened to use its privilege — not its right — of \r\nveto.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council and the IAEA have \r\nnot condemned Israel’s f lagrant military aggression \r\nThe work of this international coordination platform \r\nserves the Agency’s member States with the aim of \r\nenhancing research and cooperation in countering \r\nthe consequences of climate change, which acidifies \r\nthe oceans and poses a serious threat to many marine \r\norganisms, especially shellfish and corals.\r\nThe acidification of the oceans has been the subject \r\nof efforts by the Scientific Centre of Monaco for a \r\nnumber of years. I should note that representatives of the \r\nIAEA’s Ocean Acidification International Coordination \r\nCentre and the Scientific Centre of Monaco presented \r\ntheir work on the subject to the Member States at \r\nthe June meeting of the United Nations Open-ended \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea.\r\nNuclear applications in the area of health are \r\nalso essential. In September 2011, on the occasion \r\nof the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nEnvironmental Laboratories and on the margins of \r\nDirector General Amano’s visit to the Principality, a \r\nframework agreement was signed aimed at strengthening \r\ncooperation in the use of nuclear technologies in the \r\narea of health. As a result, Monaco has committed to \r\nworking with the IAEA in support of the Programme \r\nof Action for Cancer Therapy, designed to respond \r\nto a crisis of a global scale. Through the partnership, \r\nMonaco intends to make a major contribution to \r\nthe prevention, detection and treatment of cancer in \r\nlow- and middle-income countries, where more than \r\n100 million people could die of the disease by 2020 .\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco’s support for the IAEA and \r\nits Director General, and to congratulate him on his \r\nleadership. I would also like to thank the Agency’s \r\nrepresentative to the United Nations, Mr. Geoffrey \r\nShaw, in whom we always find a reliable and effective \r\npartner. It is in testimony to that support for continued \r\ncooperation that Monaco has co-sponsored draft \r\nresolution A/68/L.10.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): Although the international community \r\nunanimously agrees that the sole real nuclear danger in \r\nthe Middle East resides in Israel’s possession of nuclear \r\narms and the means of delivering them to distant \r\ndestinations — Israel’s nuclear weapons can reach \r\n5,000 miles, as far as the borders of China — some of \r\nthose who turn a blind eye to that crystal-clear reality \r\nare nonetheless quite happy to open illusory fronts on \r\ndubious motives.\r\n13-54995 9/13\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.45\r\nFourthly, under the Statute of the Agency the United \r\nStates of America was required to inform the IAEA \r\nof the information in its possession before destroying \r\nthe installation, and not after eight months. The same \r\napplies to Israel, which did not supply the Agency \r\nwith any information, accurate or otherwise. Rather, it \r\nperpetrated a condemnable military aggression against \r\nour sovereign territory, infiltrating our air space from \r\na neighbouring State, Turkey. The Agency did not \r\naddress this violation pursuant to its mandate it or take \r\nany of the necessary measures, in accordance with its \r\ncompetencies and responsibility, with regard to Israel’s \r\nbreach of its international obligations.\r\nMost of the contents of the report of the Agency \r\non the Dair Alzour site, drawn up by the current \r\nDirector General, relied on the imagery and analyses \r\nsubmitted eight months later by the United States \r\nCentral Intelligence Agency. This raises many \r\nquestions regarding the information received by the \r\nAgency, including on the nature of the authenticating \r\ndocuments, given the fact that such information was \r\nsubmitted by a State with a political agenda inimical \r\nto the interests of my country, Syria, and taking into \r\nconsideration the precedent set in this regard, namely, \r\nthe Iraqi dossier, of which everyone is aware.\r\nMr. Umemoto (Japan): Let me begin by thanking \r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, for introducing \r\nthe IAEA’s annual report (see A/68/PV.43). Let me also \r\ncongratulate Mr. Amano on his re-election as Director \r\nGeneral. I would like to assure him that the full support \r\nof my Government will be extended to him.\r\nThe Government of Japan also welcomes Brunei \r\nDarussalam and the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as \r\nnew members of the IAEA.\r\nThe Government of Japan would like to express \r\ngratitude once again for the great support and assistance \r\nthat has been provided by the international community \r\nfor more than two and a half years since the earthquake \r\nof 2011, its resulting tsunami and the accident at the \r\nFukushima Daiichi nuclear power station of the Tokyo \r\nElectric Power Company (TEPCO). I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to briefly explain our current efforts to \r\naddress that accident. \r\nTaking countermeasures against the leakage of \r\ncontaminated water is the most urgent task for us. As \r\nPrime Minister Abe has stated, the entire Government \r\nwill continue to work in an integrated manner to put \r\nagainst Syria at the time, probably because they are used \r\nto Israel’s violating their international and legitimate \r\nresolutions relating to our region with impunity. Israel \r\nhas refused to cooperate with the Agency and to allow \r\nits inspectors to verify the possible contamination \r\nemanating from Israeli rockets, as well as the material \r\nused to destroy the site at Dair Alzour. \r\nIsrael’s lack of cooperation with the Agency’s \r\ndemands, its ongoing development of its military-\r\nnuclear capacity without international supervision, \r\nand its disregard of every call for the establishment \r\nof a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East undermine the \r\ncredibility of the NPT system, threaten the security and \r\nstability of the peoples and States of the Middle East, \r\nand weaken the NPT’s universality. All these serious \r\nissues are documented and well known to the IAEA. \r\nWe expected the Director General to raise these facts \r\ninstead of using such indecisive phrases as “it was very \r\nlikely”, as he said yesterday.\r\nThirdly, it will be very helpful to read to the \r\nAssembly a paragraph from pages 228 and 229 of a \r\nbook by the previous Director General of the IAEA, \r\nMr. Mohamed ElBaradei, The Age of Deception: \r\nNuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous Times.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“One of the strangest and most striking \r\nexamples of nuclear hypocrisy, multilateral and \r\nmultifaceted, must surely be Israel’s bombing of \r\nthe Dair Alzour installation in Syria in September \r\n2007, and the aftermath of that attack. Speculation \r\nbegan almost immediately that the site had housed a \r\nnuclear facility. Syria denied the accusations. Israel \r\nand the United States remained officially silent, \r\nalthough American officials talked anonymously \r\non the subject to the media. I spoke out strongly, \r\nnoting that any country with information indicating \r\nthat the bombed facility was nuclear was under a \r\nlegal obligation to report it to the IAEA, but no one \r\ncame forward with such a report. For the six weeks \r\nfollowing the bombing — the most crucial period \r\nin terms of seeing inside the facility — we were \r\nunable to obtain any high-resolution imagery from \r\ncommercial satellites.”\r\nElbaradei goes on for pages and pages on this issue, \r\ndenying that the site of Dair Alzour in Syria was hosting \r\na nuclear facility. He was Mr. Amano’s predecessor.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\n10/13 13-54995\r\nA/68/PV.45 06/11/2013\r\nthat Japan will actively cooperate with the IAEA to \r\nformulate the Agency’s comprehensive report on the \r\nFukushima Daiichi accident.\r\nIn July, the IAEA successfully organized the \r\nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security, the \r\nfirst-ever ministerial-level conference on this issue \r\nat the IAEA. Japan would once again like to express \r\nits great appreciation for the efforts made by Director \r\nGeneral Amano and his staff. Japan continues to play a \r\nresponsible role in strengthening nuclear security as a \r\ncountry utilizing nuclear energy.\r\nIn order to promote the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy, it is essential that we strengthen safeguards \r\nwhile ensuring nuclear safety and security. Japan \r\ntherefore advocates the universalization of the additional \r\nprotocol in the context of strengthening safeguards. In \r\nthat regard, Japan welcomes the fact that five States \r\nconcluded additional protocols in 2012 and is grateful \r\nfor the work of the IAEA secretariat in this regard. \r\nJapan, in cooperation with the IAEA and other member \r\nStates, will continue to work on the universalization of \r\nthe additional protocol.\r\nThe nuclear and missile development programmes \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nincluding its work on uranium enrichment, are serious \r\nviolations of the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nA nuclear test by the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea is totally unacceptable, as it represents a grave \r\nchallenge to the international non-proliferation regime \r\ncentred on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, and seriously undermines the peace \r\nand security of North-East Asia and the international \r\ncommunity as a whole.\r\nFurthermore, Japan is gravely concerned about the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s announcement \r\nin April revealing its intention to readjust and restart its \r\nYongbyon nuclear facilities. Japan strongly urges the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to comply fully \r\nwith all its international obligations and commitments \r\nunder Security Council resolutions and the 2005 Joint \r\nStatement of the Six-Party Talks, and to completely \r\nabandon all its nuclear weapons and missile development \r\nprogrammes in a verifiable and irreversible manner. \r\nJapan supports the critical role that the IAEA continues \r\nto play in resolving the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea nuclear issue.\r\nThe Iranian nuclear issue is also a serious concern \r\nfor the whole international community. While taking \r\nits full weight behind resolving the contaminated \r\nwater issue, while also enhancing the dissemination of \r\naccurate information to the international community.\r\nWith regard to the impact of the contaminated \r\nwater, increased radioactivity was observed within the \r\nport of TEPCO’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power \r\nstation in an area smaller than 0.3 square kilometres. \r\nNo significant increase in radioactive levels has been \r\ndetected outside the port at present, and the radioactive \r\nlevel outside the port and in the open sea remains below \r\nthe limit of the World Health Organization guideline \r\nfor drinking water quality.\r\nThe nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nnuclear power station were cooled down and stabilized \r\nby the end of 2011. A significant decrease in radioactive \r\nreleases has also been achieved. The Government of \r\nJapan and TEPCO are steadily taking measures to \r\ndecommission the reactors. The decommissioning \r\nof the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station \r\nand resolution of the contaminated water issue are \r\nunprecedented tasks in which we are facing a series of \r\ndifficulties. A structure to bring together technologies, \r\nexpertise and wisdom from Japan and the international \r\ncommunity, including the IAEA, is needed.\r\nIn this context, the second IAEA decommissioning \r\nmission to address the contaminated water issue will \r\nbe in Japan towards the end of November, following \r\nthe mission that took place in April. Currently, two \r\nIAEA experts on marine monitoring are visiting Japan \r\nin preparation for the decommissioning mission. \r\nJapan will deal with the contaminated water issue \r\nand the decommissioning work in an internationally \r\nopen manner and will welcome recommendations \r\nand cooperation from the IAEA and the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nJapan is determined to further contribute to the \r\nstrengthening of nuclear safety worldwide by sharing \r\nits experiences and lessons learned from the Fukushima \r\nDaiichi accident with the international community. \r\nTo this end, Japan hosted the Fukushima Ministerial \r\nConference on Nuclear Safety in December last year, in \r\ncooperation with the IAEA. One hundred and seventeen \r\nStates and 13 international organizations participated \r\nin the Conference and reaffirmed the importance of \r\nstrengthening nuclear safety. Japan expresses gratitude \r\nto the Malaysian Government for co-chairing the \r\nConference, member States for their participation, and \r\nthe IAEA secretariat for its invaluable contribution to \r\nthe success of the Conference. It goes without saying \r\n13-54995 11/13\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.45\r\nfootprints and preserve dwindling natural resources, \r\non the other. The Agency has provided important \r\nsupport to newcomer countries as well as those that are \r\nexpanding their nuclear power generation.\r\nAnother important pillar of the Agency is its work \r\nin verification. The IAEA has unquestionably proved to \r\nbe an independent and impartial organization that fulfils \r\nthe task of safeguards implementation in accordance \r\nwith established agreements with individual member \r\nStates. South Africa supports the Agency’s efforts to \r\nstrengthen the safeguards system in all States with \r\nsafeguards agreements in force and within its legal \r\nmandate.\r\nIn response to the Fukushima nuclear power plant \r\naccident two years ago, the IAEA took decisive steps \r\nto strengthen the global nuclear safety framework. The \r\nadoption of the Action Plan on Nuclear Safety was a \r\nmilestone and an important display of the secretariat’s \r\nand member States’ commitments to taking \r\nresponsibility for nuclear safety. While nuclear security \r\nremains the responsibility of each member State, South \r\nAfrica welcomes the progress made to strengthen \r\nnuclear security at the international level through the \r\nimportant work of the IAEA, which included its hosting \r\nof the first ministerial-level conference on nuclear \r\nsecurity earlier this year.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa remains firm in \r\nits commitment to nuclear disarmament, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. We support the IAEA as the only internationally \r\nrecognized competent authority responsible for verifying \r\nand ensuring compliance with safeguards agreements \r\nof States parties, concluded in compliance with their \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. South Africa stands ready to work \r\nwith all member States to strengthen the work of the \r\nAgency across all pillars of the IAEA’s work.\r\nThe Acting President: We have now heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 88.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.10. Before giving the f loor to the speaker \r\nin explanation of vote before the vote, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has before it draft resolution \r\nnote of the recent positive atmosphere brought about \r\nby the new Iranian Government, Japan urges Iran to \r\ncomply with the demands of the relevant resolutions \r\nof the Security Council and the IAEA Board of \r\nGovernors. We also call on Iran to take substantive \r\naction to resolve the issue peacefully. Japan notes that \r\nat the most recent meeting between the IAEA and Iran, \r\non 28 and 29 October, there were positive developments \r\nthat could be conducive to substantive progress towards \r\nresolving Iran’s nuclear issue. Japan continues to \r\nsupport the IAEA’s efforts in that regard. We expect \r\nto see meaningful negotiations between Iran, the E3+3 \r\nand the IAEA, hoping that the negotiations will soon \r\nlead to concrete results.\r\nMr. Wensley (South Africa): South Africa wishes \r\nto congratulate Mr. Yukiya Amano on his re-election \r\nas Director General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), and to thank him for introducing the \r\n2012 annual report on the work of the Agency (see \r\nA/68/PV.43).\r\nOver several decades, the work of the IAEA has \r\nadvanced the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The \r\nIAEA’s interventions in an array of important sectors \r\nsuch as human health, water and agriculture have \r\nsought to contribute to food security and poverty \r\nreduction. The Agency’s interventions in those areas \r\nare unique, due to its specific nature, and South Africa \r\ngreatly values the development and application of \r\ntechnologies that have the potential to profoundly \r\ninfluence socioeconomic development, especially in \r\ncountries on the African continent. It can be expected \r\nthat the Agency will continue to do more in those areas, \r\ngiven the growing number of its member States in the \r\ndeveloping world. The Agency is also to be lauded for \r\nthe partnerships it has established in that regard with \r\nother relevant agencies of the broader United Nations \r\nfamily. \r\nThe Agency’s key goal is to accelerate and enlarge \r\nthe contribution of atomic energy to peace, health and \r\nprosperity throughout the world. Member States of the \r\nIAEA should therefore continue to work together to \r\nenhance the capacity of the Agency to provide more \r\ntechnical cooperation.\r\nEvents over the past few years have focused much \r\nattention on nuclear power generation. A number of \r\nStates are engaged in processes to increase nuclear \r\npower’s share of their energy mix, a move necessitated \r\nby the imperatives of economic growth and security of \r\nsupply, on the one hand, and by the need to reduce carbon \r\n12/13 13-54995\r\nA/68/PV.45 06/11/2013\r\nUnfortunately, the report does not reflect any \r\nof those facts. Therefore, if the IAEA is supposed to \r\nintervene to settle the nuclear dispute in the Korean \r\npeninsula peacefully, it should consider our country and \r\nthe Korean peninsula with neutrality and impartiality. \r\nAs to a statement made yesterday, referring once again \r\nto nuclear tests and Security Council resolutions, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea has made \r\nit clear time and time again that those nuclear tests \r\nwere conducted in response to the rampant and violent \r\ninfringement of our sovereignty and to the insult to \r\nthe dignity and national pride of our people, who had \r\nsuccessfully launched a peaceful satellite in December \r\n2012.\r\nOnce again, we would like to make it clear that that \r\nwas a legitimate exercise of our sovereign power and \r\nright under the Charter of the United Nations. It cannot \r\nbe considered a violation of the Security Council \r\nresolutions, which purely reflect the manipulations of \r\nthe United States and its abuse of power. If our use of \r\nballistic missiles to launch satellites is to be singled \r\nout for questioning, the United States is the country \r\nthat should be brought before and sanctioned by the \r\nSecurity Council. Of all the space-faring countries, it \r\nis the number-one launcher and champion of satellites \r\nin outer space.\r\nAs for the position of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea concerning the settlement of the \r\nnuclear issue, in view of all the aforementioned factors \r\nwe would like to make it clear once again that, under \r\nthe principle of action for action, the United States — as \r\nthe creator and producer of nuclear weapon and the \r\nperpetrator of nuclea blackmail and hostility against \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea — should \r\nmake the first move. If the United States moves, we \r\ncan move, but so long as it does not move we are in \r\nno position to move. As long as the nuclear blackmail \r\nand hostility continue, we have no other option but to \r\ncontinue strengthening our war deterrent — that is, our \r\nnuclear weapon capability. We disassociate ourselves \r\nfrom the adoption of draft resolution A/68/L.10.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake action on draft resolution A/68/L.10, entitled \r\n“Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nA/68/L.10, on the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency. Regarding the draft resolution, the \r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea once again considers one part of the report to \r\nbe completely biased, one-sided and without any \r\nimpartiality. My delegation would therefore like to \r\npoint to two factors that are critical to understanding \r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\r\nFirst, the report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (see A/68/324) has once again ignored the fact \r\nthat the United States is the creator, progenitor and \r\noriginator of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. \r\nIt was the United States that brought nuclear weapons \r\nto South Korea in 1957, not the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. Again, it was the United States that \r\nincreased the number of weapons deployed to more than \r\n1,000 in the 1970s; it was not the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nSecondly, the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency has once again ignored the fact that the \r\nUnited States is the perpetrator of nuclear blackmail \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and \r\nits people. Again, it was the United States conducting \r\nblackmail, as early as the 1950s, during the time of the \r\nKorean War. Accounts of that time claimed that, by \r\norder of Mr. Truman, who was President at the time, \r\nthe United States would turn the Korean peninsula into \r\na radioactive corridor. By 1957, they were bringing in \r\nmore and more nuclear weapons. In 2002, the United \r\nStates officially declared the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea part of the axis of evil, which meant \r\nthat it was to be eliminated, and listed my country as a \r\ntarget for pre-emptive nuclear strike.\r\nEarlier this year, the United States, jointly with \r\nSouth Korea, listed the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea as a target for nuclear deterrence. Under \r\nthis policy, the United States continues to carry out \r\nsuccessive military excercises with South Korea. Every \r\ntime they come, they bring whatever they have got, \r\nincluding a triad of nuclear weapons launchable by air, \r\nsea and land, B-52 bombers, the USS George Washington \r\naircraft carrier, and nuclear-powered submarines. All \r\nthese vectors carry live nuclear weapons to threaten and \r\nblackmail the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand its people, sovereignty, dignity, security and safety. \r\nAll of this reveal the true creator and perpetrator of \r\nnuclear blackmail. The Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea is simply and purely a victim of such hostilities.\r\n13-54995 13/13\r\n06/11/2013 A/68/PV.45\r\nabout nuclear tests launched by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea? There is no moral justification \r\nfor Japan to raise the issue of anybody else’s nuclear \r\nactivity. It is Japan that should be questioned first.\r\nSecondly, the representative of Japan made \r\nreference to obligations pursuant to that Security \r\nCouncil resolution. Once again, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea would like to make it clear \r\nthat it totally rejects that resolution, which was adopted \r\nillegally and manipulated by one so-called permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council.\r\nThirdly, he made the reference to the peace and \r\nsecurity of North-East Asia. He gave the strong \r\nimpression that Japan is a peace-loving country, but it \r\nis the opposite. It is becoming a nuclear Power under \r\nthe nuclear umbrella of the United States. It has aligned \r\nits entire territory as a launch pad for attack against \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Under the \r\nbilateral agreement, Japan is supposed to open all its \r\nfacilities for the military activities of the United States. \r\nTherefore, who is the perpetrator and offender of peace \r\nand security in the region? It is clearly Japan.\r\nFourthly, he again made reference to the Six-\r\nParty Talks. In the process of the Six-Party Talks, the \r\nJapanese delegation raised the abduction issue, which \r\nhas nothing to do with the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula. It invited the criticism of all the other five \r\nparticipants, but it has never honoured its commitments \r\nunder the Six-Party Talks. Every one of the six parties \r\nhas the commitment and obligation to fully honour it, \r\nbut Japan was the only country that has never, ever \r\nhonoured its commitment. Therefore, again, Japan has \r\nno moral or legal authority or justification.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 88?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.40 p.m.\r\nannounce that, in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin document A/68/L.10 or previously mentioned during \r\nthe introduction of the draft resolution, the following \r\ncountries have also become sponsors: Albania, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Colombia, \r\nCosta Rica, Croatia, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, \r\nIceland, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, Peru, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, \r\nSan Marino, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/68/L.10?\r\nDraft resolution A/68/L.10 was adopted (resolution \r\n68/10).\r\nThe Acting President: One representatives has \r\nasked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I remind \r\nhim that statements in the exercise of the right of reply \r\nare limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and \r\nto five minutes for the second intervention, and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea): I am sorry to ask for the f loor again. Regarding \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Japan, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea would like to \r\nclarify its position.\r\nThe representative of Japan made reference to \r\nmany issues concerning our country’s so-called nuclear \r\nactivities. I believe that, as usual, he made reference to \r\nfive major factors.\r\nFirst, he referred again to the nuclear test, which \r\nraises a question. Why is Japan clamouring against \r\nnuclear testing when it joined the United States \r\nin manipulating the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2087 (2013) against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea’s peaceful satellite launch? The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea launch was \r\nfollowed by a Japanese launch. The United States and \r\nthe Security Council kept silent. Why are we still talking \r\n"
