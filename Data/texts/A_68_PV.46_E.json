Similarly, the group does not have a negotiating \r\nmandate. That mandate belongs to Member States in \r\nthe format of the intergovernmental negotiations of \r\nthe Open-ended Working Group on Security Council \r\nReform.\r\nEqually important, the advisory group does not \r\nhave a mandate to draft a resolution, declaration or \r\ndocument of any kind. Rather, drawing upon decision \r\n62/557, the discussions that have taken place in the \r\nintergovernmental framework and the content of \r\nthis debate, the advisory group has been tasked with \r\nproviding ideas to me as President of the General \r\nAssembly to help start the negotiations that will begin \r\non or about 15 November, under the auspices of the \r\nappointed Chair, Ambassador Tanin of Afghanistan. It \r\nwill be my prerogative whether or not to accept the ideas \r\nof my advisory group. I hope that the deliberations here \r\ntoday will provide it with food for thought.\r\nIn my time at the United Nations, I have presided \r\nover a fair number of negotiating processes. None of \r\nthem can be described as easy and some were extremely \r\ndifficult, but they have all taught me valuable lessons. \r\nOne of those is that when representatives come to the \r\ntable in a true negotiating spirit, prepared to make \r\nthe necessary compromises to create an acceptable \r\noutcome, negotiations are almost always successful. \r\nEqually true is the fact that where there is no willingness \r\nto compromise, negotiations invariably end in failure. I \r\ntherefore urge you not to let that be the case on this \r\nvery important item, perhaps the most important on \r\nthis Assembly’s agenda.\r\nOur United Nations is and must remain a place \r\nwhere we collectively reach compromise, a place \r\nof accommodation. The essence of the process of \r\nnegotiations is compromise. Each and every side on \r\nthat question must make concessions if we are to find \r\nan acceptable common ground.\r\nAt the start of the general debate, I promised that \r\nwhenever and wherever true leadership was required \r\nand whenever deadlocks must be broken and processes \r\nadvanced, I would do my utmost to be resolute, \r\nfair, even-handed and unequivocal. The question of \r\nSecurity Council reform demands that I remain true \r\nto that promise. Today, I wish to assure members that \r\nI will. However, I am sure that all understand that, \r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 113?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 29 and 123\r\nReport of the Security Council\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/68/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters\r\nThe President: Today, we are here to discuss \r\nan issue that is important to each and every Member \r\nState, namely, the question of Security Council reform. \r\nKnowing well the interests and concerns that we all \r\nshare in the singular goal of making progress on that \r\nimportant question, I am pleased to welcome you to this \r\ndebate.\r\nMany will recall that, on my election as President \r\nof the General Assembly, I emphasized the need to \r\nreinvigorate and advance the question of Security \r\nCouncil reform and stressed that I would make it a \r\npriority. While that commitment remains solid, the \r\nextent of the challenge is not lost on me. My team and \r\nI have been increasingly committed to identifying how \r\nto give new life to the established intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating process on the question. To that end, we \r\nheld consultations with virtually every interest group \r\non the issue to ascertain the thoughts of Member States \r\nand, more important, their expectations. Based on the \r\nfeedback that I received, I created an advisory group \r\nto assist me in identifying ways by which the process \r\ncould move forward.\r\nAs stated in my letter of 22 October to Member \r\nStates, the advisory group comprises the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Belgium, Brazil, Liechtenstein, \r\nPapua New Guinea, San Marino and Sierra Leone. I \r\nwould like to clarify that its membership was not chosen \r\non the basis of geographical representation. Rather, \r\nthere were three primary areas of consideration, namely, \r\nthe size of the group, representation of the various \r\ninterests in the debate, and the fact that its members, \r\never mindful of their individual or group positions, \r\nwould seek to look past interests and provide me with \r\nadvice on how to move the discussions forward.\r\n13-55224 3/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nOver the past year, the Council, in close cooperation \r\nwith such regional and subregional organizations as \r\nthe African Union and the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States, has worked for a settlement to \r\nthe conflict in Mali through active mediation and has \r\npromoted the restoration of constitutional order and \r\nnational stability in that country by taking swift actions \r\nto authorize the establishment of the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nMali.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nCouncil strengthened the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand endorsed the Peace, Security and Cooperation \r\nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the region. In Somalia, the Council established \r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia to \r\nsupport the Somali Government’s efforts for security \r\nand reconciliation as well as to enhance coordination \r\namong various United Nations agencies in Somalia. \r\nThe Council followed closely the situation in the Sudan \r\nand South Sudan, supported the efforts of the African \r\nUnion and subregional organizations to stabilize the \r\nCentral African Republic, and undertook peacebuilding \r\noperations in Burundi, Sierra Leone and Guinea-\r\nBissau, thus playing an important role in maintaining \r\npeace and stability in Africa.\r\nThe Council also made great efforts to promote \r\npeace and stability in the Middle East. Over the past \r\nyear, the Council held monthly discussions on the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian issue and supported the efforts \r\nof the parties involved to promote the resumption of \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian negotiations and advance the Middle \r\nEast peace process. The Council remained focused \r\non the situation in Syria, drawing on a high number \r\nof briefings from a range of relevant senior United \r\nNations officials in conducting a total of 28 meetings \r\nand consultations and releasing four press statements on \r\nSyria. The Council also followed closely the situation \r\nin other parts of the Middle East, including Lebanon, \r\nLibya, Iraq and Yemen. The Council visited Yemen \r\nearlier this year, reaffirming its continued support for \r\nthe ongoing political transition process, in accordance \r\nwith the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative.\r\nThe Council has long paid equally close attention \r\non its agenda to issues in Asia and Europe. A case that is \r\nworth mentioning is Timor-Leste. Thanks to the tireless \r\nefforts of the Government of Timor-Leste and strong \r\nsupport from the international community, Timor-Leste \r\nin the final analysis, the success or otherwise of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations will ultimately depend \r\non Member States. The negotiations are their process, \r\nand their success depends entirely on how members \r\nchoose to carry them forward. Whenever I am called \r\nupon to assist members I am fully prepared to do so.\r\nUltimately, we are all stakeholders in the success \r\nof the process. I would therefore like to think that after \r\nthe statements have been delivered in this debate, and \r\nwhen the time for hard negotiations comes, each of you \r\nwill be willing to show openness and f lexibility. That \r\nis absolutely critical if we are to make progress in the \r\nnegotiations, and it is my challenge to you now: stay \r\nfocused on the long-term goal and be f lexible in the \r\nprocess.\r\nI now give the f loor to the President of the Security \r\nCouncil to introduce the report of the Council.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China), President of the Security \r\nCouncil (spoke in Chinese): First of all, I would like \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on behalf of all the members \r\nof the Security Council, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly. I thank you for arranging \r\ntoday’s meeting.\r\nAs the President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of November, it is my honour to introduce the \r\nannual report of the Security Council, contained in \r\ndocument A/68/2. The report covers the period from \r\n1 August 2012 through 31 July 2013.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations entrusts the \r\nSecurity Council with the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nOver the past year, with the support of the whole \r\nUnited Nations membership, the Security Council has \r\nsought to actively discharge its responsibilities, urging \r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and undertaking a \r\nseries of peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities all \r\nover the world. It has responded to a variety of security \r\nthreats, leading to some positive results and playing a \r\ncentral role in efforts to maintain international peace \r\nand security.\r\nAddressing hot-spot issues on the African continent \r\nhas long been a focus of the Council’s work. More than \r\n60 per cent of the Council’s agenda items are related \r\nto Africa, and half of the United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations are deployed on that continent. The peace \r\nand security of Africa are inseparable from those of the \r\nwhole world.\r\n4/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nbe happy to convey your views to my colleagues at the \r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Minah (Sierra Leone): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the African Union \r\nand to thank you, Sir, for convening this joint debate \r\non item 29, entitled “Report of the Security Council”, \r\nand agenda item 123, entitled “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”, as well as \r\nthe report of the Security Council (A/68/2).\r\nMr. President, we greatly appreciate your forward-\r\nlooking and instructive opening remarks this morning. \r\nWe wish to assure you of our support throughout the \r\nperiod of your presidency. I would also like to thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of China for introducing the \r\nreport on the Security Council covering the activities of \r\nthe Council from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013 (A/68/2). \r\nI also wish to congratulate Ambassador Zahir Tanin on \r\nhis reappointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and to reiterate our commitment to work \r\nwith him to ensure a speedy and comprehensive reform \r\nof the Council.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of the States members of the African \r\nUnion to this very important issue. We look forward \r\nto working with all interest groups in making decisive \r\nprogress during this session.We are heartened that \r\nsince the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1), many Heads of States and Government taking the \r\nf loor during the Assembly’s general debate continue \r\nto reaffirm the need to reform the Security Council \r\nin order to make it more representative, democratic, \r\neffective, transparent and legitimate. Therefore we \r\nmust all continue to strive to reach an early agreement \r\non a reform model that takes into account the core \r\nvalues of the United Nations: inclusiveness, democracy, \r\naccountability, equality and transparency.\r\nAfrica’s continued participation in this debate \r\nis firmly rooted in our commitment to the African \r\ncommon position as articulated in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration on the reform of \r\nthe United Nations. We remain convinced of the need \r\nfor comprehensive reform of the United Nations system \r\nthat upholds the very principles of the Charter for a \r\nfairer world, one based on universalism, equity and \r\nregional balance. Within this reform process, we remain \r\npersuaded that the reform of the United Nations should \r\nbe all-inclusive, encompassing all the components \r\nentered a new stage in its national development, and \r\nthe United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste \r\nsuccessfully completed its mandate on 31 December \r\n2012.\r\nWhile actively dealing with regional hot-spot \r\nissues, the Council never slackened in its close attention \r\nto thematic issues in the area of international peace \r\nand security. It adopted a series of effective actions \r\nand promoted international cooperation in such areas \r\nas counter-terrorism, non-proliferation and combating \r\ntransnational organized crime. It also strengthened the \r\ncapacity of the international community in collectively \r\nresponding to security threats and challenges of all \r\nkinds. The Council held a number of thematic debates \r\non such topics as the protection of civilians in armed \r\nconflict, children and armed conflict, women and \r\npeace and security, peacekeeping and post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding, piracy, peace and security in Africa, \r\nand the rule of law.\r\nThose debates enabled the Council to hear the \r\nviews of the membership of the United Nations \r\nand helped foster international consensus on the \r\nissues concerned. The Council worked persistently \r\nto strengthen communication and exchanges with \r\nregional organizations such as the African Union, the \r\nLeague of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation and conducted fruitful cooperation with \r\nthem in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nIn order to better fulfil its responsibilities under the \r\nCharter and respond to the calls of the Member States, \r\nthe Council attaches great importance to improving \r\nits working methods and has worked tirelessly in that \r\nregard. The Council held 174 public meetings over the \r\npast year. To implement the note by the President of the \r\nCouncil in document S/2010/507, five wrap-up sessions \r\nwere convened in 2013.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the \r\nCouncil also deliberated on many other issues that had \r\nlong captured international attention. I will not go into \r\ndetails here. As a general practice, the introduction to \r\nthe report was prepared by the delegation of the United \r\nStates, which held the presidency of the Council in July \r\n2013. Members of the Council also contributed to the \r\npreparation of the report, and the Secretariat worked \r\ndiligently to compile it. I would like to express my \r\ngratitude to all those involved. I welcome the discussion \r\nby Member States on the report at this meeting and will \r\n13-55224 5/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nTo that end, we urge the wider United Nations \r\nmembership to step up its efforts in working with Africa \r\nto urgently address what we consider an injustice. We \r\nconsider that procrastination in that matter is a travesty \r\nof justice and fair play that continues to undermine \r\nthe dignity of the African people and diminishes the \r\nlegitimacy of the Security Council.\r\nIn seeking progress on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increasing the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters, we must at \r\nthis stage endeavour to reach an agreement on how \r\nto move forward with the updated third revision of \r\nthe compiled text. That should take into account \r\nthe various suggestions made to date, as well as the \r\nconcerns raised on how to proceed with the documents, \r\nincluding the letter by the African Union’s Committee \r\nof Ten Heads of State (C-10) of 16 May 2013, addressed \r\nto Ambassador Tanin. There is therefore a need for the \r\nmembership to first agree on the principles and criteria \r\nof the negotiations vis-à-vis the five negotiables and \r\nthe interlinkages, before embarking on any drafting \r\nexercise.\r\nWhile taking note of your letter of 22 October, \r\nMr. President, we continue to advise that when \r\nnecessary you continue to clarify, for the benefit of \r\nthe general membership, the role of the advisory group \r\nand how it relates to the work of the facilitator and the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process, in particular \r\nthe implication of that group producing a basis for the \r\nstart of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nDecision 62/557, in laying the basis for \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, identified the five \r\nnegotiable issues that, for the most part, are interlinked: \r\ncategories of membership, the question of the veto, \r\nregional representation, the size of an enlarged \r\nCouncil, and the working methods of the Council, and \r\nthe relationship between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nOn the question of the relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly and the \r\nworking methods, the C-10 at all times maintained a \r\nprincipled position on those issues, underscoring the \r\nneed to uphold the primacy of, and full respect for, \r\nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nappertaining to the powers and functions of the General \r\nAssembly. The two clusters are inextricably linked, and \r\nthere has been some convergence of views in general. \r\nThat notwithstanding, several concrete proposals on \r\nof the United Nations system, including the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council.\r\nIn that regard, we continue the call for comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council as contained in General \r\nAssembly decision 62/557, which provides the basis of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations and guidance on \r\nthe interconnectedness of the five clusters of Security \r\nCouncil reform. We remain firmly convinced that the \r\nAfrican common position continues to enjoy broad \r\nsupport among the majority of the membership and \r\nremains a viable option for Council reform.\r\nWe note that the main thrust of all various groups \r\nand stakeholder positions advanced to date is to ensure \r\nthat the Security Council is inclusive, accountable, \r\ntransparent, accessible and effective. That, we believe, \r\nwill help ensure the promotion and preservation of the \r\nprinciples of equity and democracy and further enhance \r\nthe legitimacy of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe must reiterate that correcting the historical \r\ninjustice suffered by the African continent — as the \r\nonly continent not represented in the permanent \r\ncategory of the Council and underrepresented in \r\nthe non-permanent category — is imperative and \r\nlong overdue. In pursuit of that objective, we remain \r\ncommitted to building alliances on the basis of the \r\nAfrican common position, with diverse interest groups \r\nand Member States engaged in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. That would be with a view to achieving \r\nthe much desired reform of the Security Council.\r\nIt is manifestly clear that Africa’s position is a \r\ncontinental aspiration, which we believe all Member \r\nStates and other stakeholders are familiar with. In that \r\nregard, it is important to recall that in 1945, when the \r\nUnited Nations was established, most of Africa was \r\nnot represented, and when the first reform took place \r\nin 1963, Africa was not considered for inclusion in the \r\npermanent category, even though it was represented.\r\nCircumstances have now changed. It is proper for \r\nAfrica to be fully represented in all decision-making \r\norgans of the United Nations, including the Security \r\nCouncil. Full representation of Africa in the Council, \r\nwe say, should be according to the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nand the Sirte Declaration. That, in brief, means no less \r\nthan two permanent seats with all the prerogatives \r\nand privileges of permanent membership, including \r\nthe right of veto, if it continues to exist, and also two \r\nadditional non-permanent seats.\r\n6/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\ntake this opportunity to thank the representative of \r\nChina for presenting the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil for the period from 1 August 2012 to 31 July \r\n2013 (A/68/2), and the United States delegation for \r\npreparing its introduction.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to achieving concrete results in Security \r\nCouncil reform through intergovernmental negotiations \r\non the basis of decision 62/557 and subsequent decisions, \r\nending with decision 67/561.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should be \r\naddressed in an early, comprehensive, transparent and \r\nbalanced manner, without setting artificial deadlines. \r\nIt should ensure that the Council’s agenda reflects the \r\nneeds and interests of both developing and developed \r\ncountries in an objective, rational, non-selective and \r\nnon-arbitrary manner. It should address all substantive \r\nissues relating, inter alia, to the questions of membership \r\nand regional representation and the Council’s agenda, \r\nworking methods and decision-making process, \r\nincluding the veto. It should also garner the widest \r\npossible political acceptance by Member States in line \r\nwith the provisions of the Charter and the Assembly’s \r\nrelevant decisions, particularly decision 62/557.\r\nThe enlargement of the Security Council and the \r\nreform of its working methods should lead to a more \r\ndemocratic, representative, accountable and effective \r\nCouncil. The sixteenth Summit of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, held in Tehran, acknowledged the historical \r\ninjustice against Africa with regard to its representation \r\nin the Security Council. It expressed support for \r\nincreased and enhanced representation for Africa in a \r\nreformed Council. The Summit also took note of the \r\nAfrican common position as reflected in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration.\r\nThe Movement continues to call upon the Security \r\nCouncil to uphold the primacy of, and respect for, the \r\nCharter in connection with its functions and powers. We \r\nstress that a decision by the Council to initiate formal or \r\ninformal discussions on any issue that does not pertain \r\nto its mandate or on a situation in any Member State \r\nthat does not constitute a threat to international peace \r\nand security is contrary to Article 24 of the Charter.\r\nSanctions imposed by the Security Council \r\nremain an issue of serious concern to the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement. The objectives of sanctions regimes should \r\nbe clearly defined. Their application should be set for \r\nhow to improve the transparency of and access to the \r\nCouncil, including adopting set rules of procedure, \r\nremain actively on the table.\r\nImproving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil is an integral part of the reform process. We \r\ntherefore reiterate Africa’s readiness to work with all \r\ninterest groups and other Member States to achieve \r\ndecisive progress in that area — but as a comprehensive \r\npackage, not in isolation in the reform process. We hope \r\nthat work at this session will build on the progress made \r\nso far, as well as increase the pace to secure concrete \r\ngains ahead of the 2015 world summit. We do hope \r\nit will generate the necessary political will and the \r\nrequired collective f lexibility for reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in fulfilment of the forthright vision of our \r\nprinciples at the 2005 World Summit.\r\nWe look forward to working with you, \r\nMr. President, and the general membership within \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations towards a \r\ncomprehensive reform, as stipulated by decision 62/557 \r\nand other relevant Assembly decisions on the reform \r\nprocess.\r\nLet me affirm our commitment to the process \r\ntowards achieving the acknowledged common will of \r\nthe majority of the membership to correct a matter of \r\ninjustice done to Africa, which in our view, should be \r\nviewed alongside Africa’s demand, as contained in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. We call \r\non the conscience of the Assembly to continue to embrace \r\nAfrica’s aspirations for equitable representation on, and \r\nan effective voice in, the Council.\r\nThe C-10 remains open, ready and willing to enter \r\ninto consultations, both formal and informal, with all \r\ninterest groups in the interest of our collective objective.\r\nMr. Mootaz Ahmadein Khalil (Egypt): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nAt the outset, Mr. President, I would like to \r\nexpress the Movement’s appreciation for your pledge \r\nin your acceptance speech, on 14 June, to advance \r\nthe reform processes of all the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations during the sixty-eighth session \r\n(see A/67/PV.87). I would also like to congratulate \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Afghanistan on his \r\nreappointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council for \r\nthe current session. The Movement would also like to \r\n13-55224 7/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nsupport of the general membership during the sixty-\r\nseventh session. Egypt believes that the same top-\r\ndown approach will not be useful, but will only further \r\ncomplicate the process. That is why decision 62/557, \r\nwhich establishes the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, has set clear parameters \r\nfor the process. Paragraph (d) of the decision states that \r\nthe negotiations should be based on proposals submitted \r\nby Member States, not otherwise. The rationale is to \r\nmaintain the membership-driven nature of the process \r\nand preserve the impartiality of the roles of both the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nMr. President, yesterday, through your letter \r\ndated 6 November, you invited Member States to \r\nidentify the directions in which the search for common \r\nground might be undertaken in the negotiations. \r\nWe believe that in order to facilitate a smooth start \r\nfor the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\ncurrent session, we should begin by addressing all \r\nconcerns raised with regard to the third revision of \r\nthe compilation text. Time and again, concerns were \r\nraised by the African Group on merging language \r\nand streamlining positions without agreeing first on \r\nprinciples and criteria regarding the five key issues. \r\nThe Arab Group voiced similar concerns in its letter \r\ndated 31 October, stressing that merging positions and \r\nproposals regarding the reform and expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council should be done after consulting with, \r\nand obtaining the approval of, the concerned State or \r\ngroup of States.\r\nWe should not be looking for just any agreement. We \r\nare mandated here to seek a comprehensive agreement \r\nthat allows for equitable and effective representation for \r\nall regions and groups. The African common position \r\nreflected in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration aims at achieving the legitimate aspirations \r\nof a whole continent, comprising 54 countries. Its \r\nobjective is to rectify the historical injustice to Africa \r\nregarding its representation in the Security Council. \r\nIt does not seek to achieve narrow national political \r\ninterests.\r\nIt is also important to duly take into account the \r\nArab position, adopted at the summit level in 2010, \r\nrequesting a permanent seat for the Arab Group in \r\nany future expansion of the category of permanent \r\nmembership in the Security Council. We wish to remind \r\nthe Assembly as well that the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation is calling for adequate representation of \r\na specific time frame and should be based on tenable \r\nlegal grounds.\r\nThe General Assembly’s consideration of the \r\nCouncil’s annual report is a core element in the \r\nrelationship between these two principal organs. \r\nResolution 67/297, on the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly, welcomes the improvements in \r\nthe quality of the Security Council’s annual reports and \r\nencourages the Council to make further improvements \r\nas necessary. Having examined this year’s annual report \r\nof the Security Council, prepared in accordance with \r\nCouncil presidential note S/2010/507, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement acknowledges the improvement in quality. \r\nNevertheless, further steps are still needed to make \r\nthe annual report more explanatory and analytical in \r\nassessing the work of the Council. It is also imperative \r\nthat future reports reflect the general views expressed \r\nby non-Council members during open debates.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement remains committed \r\nto the ongoing process of the overall reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, including the reform and expansion \r\nof the Security Council. Any reform measures should \r\nbe decided by the general membership through a \r\ntransparent and inclusive intergovernmental process. \r\nThe voice of each Member State must be heard and \r\nrespected.\r\nThe foregoing was a statement made on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement. I shall now offer few more \r\nwords in my national capacity.\r\nI would like first to associate my remarks with the \r\nstatement just delivered by the representative of Sierra \r\nLeone on behalf of the African Group.\r\nMr. President, we have received your letter of \r\n22 October 2013 on the proposed way forward for \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the reform of \r\nthe Security Council during the sixty-eighth session, \r\nincluding the establishment of an advisory group. We \r\nhave taken note of the fact that the letter clarifies that \r\nthe advisory group does not have a negotiating role and \r\nthat it aims only to give you advice for producing a basis \r\nfor the start of the intergovernmental negotiations that \r\nwould reflect the ideas put forward in the negotiations \r\nso far.\r\nWe stress once again that the basis for the \r\nnegotiations is the collective will of all Member States. \r\nIn July 2012, a similar attempt to push the reset button \r\nby producing a concise document failed to garner the \r\n8/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\ncommitment to the issue clearly stated in your letters of \r\n22 October and 6 November.\r\nThe G-4 countries would also like to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Zahir Tanin on his \r\nreappointment as Chair of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We look forward to his continuing \r\nstewardship of the process.\r\nAs the United Nations approaches the General \r\nAssembly’s seventieth session, it is time to reflect on \r\npast achievements, current developments and future \r\nchallenges. The approaching year 2015 reminds us that \r\n10 years after the World Summit, not everything that \r\nwas agreed upon has been realized. We therefore need \r\nto intensify efforts to translate the existing agreement \r\ninto concrete outcomes, by 2015 at the latest.\r\nThe 2005 World Summit Outcome document \r\n(resolution 60/1), which was agreed to at the highest \r\npolitical level, serves as a yardstick to help us deliver \r\non the mandate given collectively by our leaders. While \r\nimportant progress has been achieved over the past \r\nyears, including in the reform of the United Nations \r\narchitecture, a severe shortcoming remains, that is, \r\nthe lack of Security Council reform. Only a reformed \r\nSecurity Council that reflects contemporary realities \r\nwill be able to deal with the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nIt is worth recalling that the 2005 Outcome calls \r\nfor an early reform — I underline early reform — of \r\nthe Security Council. It is in that spirit that the G-4 \r\ncountries have reached out to all regional groups. \r\nWe aim to find a path that will ref lect the dominant \r\ncall by Member States for a reform of the Security \r\nCouncil that leads to an expansion in both categories \r\nof membership, the permanent and non-permanent. In \r\nso doing, we have, together with our partners, pursued \r\na constructive approach, calling for action, not only \r\nwords, and for progress, not the status quo. We are \r\nencouraged by the broad and cross-regional support \r\nthat our efforts continue to enjoy.\r\nOur position is well known. As recently as \r\n26 September, the G-4 Foreign Ministers reiterated \r\ntheir common vision of a reformed Security Council. \r\nWe took into consideration the contributions made by \r\ncountries to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and other purposes of the Organization, \r\nas well as the need for the increased representation \r\nof developing countries, especially African, in both \r\ncategories of membership in an enlarged Council. We \r\nthe Muslim world in any category of membership in an \r\nexpanded Security Council.\r\nMr. President, we count on your wisdom in building \r\non the progress achieved so far in the negotiations, \r\naccording to decision 67/561. We are confident that you \r\nwill lead a transparent process, owned by all Member \r\nStates and groups of States without exclusion, and that \r\nyou will take into account all the views and concerns \r\nexpressed in today’s debate.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of \r\nAlgeria on a point of order.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria): I raise a point of order, \r\nMr. President, to ask you to request that representatives \r\ntaking the f loor on behalf of groups refrain from \r\nspeaking in their national capacity during those \r\nstatements. We have just heard views expressed by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Egypt speaking in his \r\nnational capacity, distorting the position of the Arab \r\nGroup concerning the Security Council reform. I would \r\nlike to protest, and I will take the opportunity to make \r\nthe appropriate clarifications when I make a statement \r\nin my national capacity.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly takes note \r\nof the observation of the Permanent Representative of \r\nAlgeria and his early notification that he intends to \r\nredress any grievances in his national capacity.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): Before I make a statement \r\non behalf of the group of four (G-4) countries, \r\nMr. President, I wish to express my thanks for your \r\nvery constructive statement earlier. I wish to assure \r\nthe Assembly that Japan will participate in the \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform with openness \r\nand f lexibility, to use your words. I also thank the \r\nPermanent Representative of China for introducing the \r\nreport of the Security Council (A/68/2).\r\nNow I wish to make a statement on behalf of the \r\nG-4 countries, namely, Brazil, Germany, India and \r\nJapan.\r\nWe wish to take the opportunity to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session and to \r\nensure you of our steadfast support. The G-4 countries \r\ngreatly appreciate the fact that you have chosen to give \r\nthe reform of the Security Council the attention that it \r\ndeserves. We also commend the concrete initiative to \r\ndrive the process forward. We further appreciate the \r\n13-55224 9/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nearlier by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, and with the statement that \r\nwill be delivered on behalf of the L.69 Group.\r\nJust a few weeks from today, on 17 December, the \r\nAssembly will be witness, wittingly or unwittingly, to \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 1991 \r\n(XVIII), entitled “Question of equitable representation \r\non the Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil”. With respect to section A of that resolution, \r\nthe object was strikingly modest, that is, to increase \r\nthe number of non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil from 6 to 10, in order to take into account the \r\nchanged reality of the world of 1963.\r\nThe resolution was adopted by vote in the face of \r\nconstraining odds: none of the permanent members \r\n(P-5) of the Security Council found it possible to support \r\nthat modest aspiration. One of the P-5 was even unable \r\nto vote, having been denied a seat in the United Nations \r\non that day. At that time, two countries — Jamaica \r\nand Trinidad and Tobago — were the only members \r\nof today’s Caribbean Community that were Members \r\nof the United Nations. But as sponsors of the proposal \r\nfor expansion and as active supporters of the process \r\nthat led to its adoption, they were counted among the \r\nprotagonists for meaningful change.\r\nTherefore, in welcoming the convening of \r\ntoday’s debate on the reform of the Security Council, \r\nCARICOM is conscious of the responsibility we all \r\nshare to bring about meaningful reform in the best \r\ninterest of the United Nations and the peoples it serves. \r\nThe object of such reform, in our view, should be to \r\nmake the Organization and all of its principal organs \r\nfit for the twenty-first century. It should render the \r\nSecurity Council more representative, democratic, \r\naccountable, accessible and effective.\r\nIn that regard, it is apposite to recall the words of \r\nthe representative of one of the Member States that \r\nparticipated in that fateful vote process decades ago:\r\n“the United Nations should faithfully bear in mind, \r\nand reflect, the interests of the groups of States \r\nwhich really exist in the world today, rather than \r\nallow itself to become a conservative body divorced \r\nfrom reality” (A/PV.1285, para. 79).\r\nhave also repeatedly emphasized that the Council’s \r\nworking methods need to be improved in order for the \r\nCouncil to become more transparent and effective. The \r\nproposals contained in our comprehensive 2005 draft \r\nresolution (A/60/L.46) remain valid.\r\nDespite all differences among members on the \r\ncontext of reform, it should be not be difficult to find \r\ncommon ground on at least one aspect, nemely, the \r\nneed to finally start text-based negotiations. Only then \r\nwill there be a chance to identify areas of commonality \r\namong the membership and to engage in a real give-and-\r\ntake process.\r\nWe therefore compliment you, Mr. President, on \r\nthe initiative and welcome the decision to establish \r\nan advisory group of eminent ambassadors to provide \r\ninput for the start of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nAs you indicate, such input should reflect the ideas put \r\nforward in the negotiations so far and identify available \r\noptions. We, the G4, firmly believe that the work of \r\nthe advisory group will enable the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to move to text-based negotiations. We \r\ncongratulate our colleagues on their appointment \r\nand look forward to the result of their work and the \r\nresumption of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nFor our part, in response to the call in the letter of \r\n6 November, Sir, the G-4 countries are ready to take \r\npart in collective actions in order to seek common \r\nground on the issue of Security Council reform. We \r\nstand ready to actively contribute to that process in a \r\nspirit of f lexibility. We also encourage others to show \r\nthe same spirit of compromise required to engage in \r\na negotiation process that deserves to be called so in \r\ncontent and not in name only. Objections to text-based \r\nnegotiations run counter not only to the spirit of the \r\nOutcome but also to the basic logic of multilateral \r\ndiplomacy. Let us strive together to fulfil the tasks that \r\nremain and prove that a reform of the Security Council \r\nis possible.\r\nIn conclusion, we thank you once again, \r\nMr. President, for your initiative, which has the \r\npotential to bring us one important step closer towards \r\nour common goal, namely, a Security Council that is \r\nmore broadly representative, effective and transparent.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): In today’s joint debate on \r\nthe report of the Security Council (A/68/2) and on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\n10/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nthe way forward, the basis presented must clearly show \r\nwhere the varying positions of Member States converge \r\nand where gaps remain, and must be reflective of the \r\npositions of all Member States, including, of course, the \r\nmajority.\r\nIn this endeavour, we have the fullest confidence \r\nin your judgement, Sir, as President of the General \r\nAssembly. Your initiative to appoint an advisory group \r\nto assist you in this endeavour is an added guarantee \r\nthat all views will be duly reflected. We have every \r\nconfidence that Ambassador Tanin, whom you have \r\nreappointed to chair the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nand the ambassadors who comprise your advisory \r\ngroup will act in the best interest of the process and of \r\nprogress, and we congratulate them and offer them our \r\nfullest support.\r\nCARICOM has remained seized at the highest \r\npolitical level of the need for definitive progress on this \r\nimportant issue, and our delegations are fully committed \r\nto playing a constructive role in the process. The twenty-\r\nfourth intersessional conference of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Caribbean Community, held in \r\nPort-Au-Prince in February, recalled “CARICOM’s \r\nlong-standing activism in the negotiations to reform \r\nthe United Nations Security Council” and called for \r\ngreater urgency in achieving lasting Security Council \r\nreform. Allow me therefore to reiterate the position of \r\nthe region on the key aspects of reform of the Council.\r\nCARICOM supports expansion in both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. We call for an increase in the size \r\nof Security Council membership from 15 to 27. \r\nCARICOM maintains that the role of developing \r\ncountries should be enhanced in both categories. In \r\nthat regard, CARICOM has been resolute in its support \r\nfor the inclusion of Africa in the permanent category \r\nof membership in the Council. CARICOM calls for \r\nprovision for a special seat for small island developing \r\nStates in a reformed Security Council. CARICOM \r\nsupports the elimination of the veto. However, in the \r\nevent of its retention, we consider that all permanent \r\nmembers of a reformed Security Council must have \r\nthe same rights and privileges. CARICOM calls for \r\nimproved working methods of the Council so as to \r\nincrease the involvement of non-members in its work \r\nand to enhance its accountability and transparency. \r\nOn the relationship between the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly, CARICOM recommends \r\nthat appropriate measures be adopted to enable the \r\nWhatever their intended meaning at the time first \r\nspoken, those words now echo with a resonance that \r\nbefits our present consideration.\r\nDoes the Security Council of today faithfully \r\nreflect the interests of the groups of States that exist in \r\nthe world today? CARICOM submits that any objective \r\nanswer to that question can be registered only in the \r\nnegative. To the Assembly, therefore, falls the task of \r\nensuring a positive and fitting response.\r\nWe therefore commend your leadership, \r\nMr. President, in bringing the issue of Security Council \r\nreform once again to the fore. It is without question the \r\ngreatest imperative for the future of the United Nations. \r\nThat is undoubtedly the reason that world leaders at \r\nthe Millennium Summit in 2000 pledged “to intensify \r\nour efforts to achieve a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in all its aspects” (resolution 55/2, \r\npara. 30); and why, at the 2005 World Summit, they \r\nagain supported early reform of the Security Council as\r\n“an essential element in the overall effort to reform \r\nthe United Nations — in order to make it more \r\nbroadly representative, efficient and transparent \r\nand thus to further enhance its effectiveness and \r\nthe legitimacy and implementation of its decisions” \r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 153).\r\nThey further committed themselves to continuing \r\nefforts to achieve a decision to that end and requested \r\nthe General Assembly to review progress by the end of \r\n2005.\r\nDespite those undertakings, the support for early \r\nreform will be effectively bereft of meaning unless \r\nthe Assembly acts to translate that consensus of \r\nintent into a meaningful plan of action. The world has \r\nchanged so much in the past five decades that the need \r\nfor a Council that is more reflective of contemporary \r\ngeopolitical realties has become a greater imperative \r\nthan ever before.The intergovernmental negotiations \r\nlaunched five years ago by decision 62/557 must now \r\nbe re-energized and reoriented to produce results.\r\nCARICOM therefore welcomes your intention, \r\nMr. President, to provide a basis for negotiations, \r\nincluding options on the way forward. Such options \r\nshould be based on an objective assessment of \r\nour discussions today and the nine rounds of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations held to date. They must \r\nbe presented in a practical, negotiable format in which \r\nreal give-and-take negotiations can begin. As we chart \r\n13-55224 11/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and related matters”, and does not cover the \r\nagenda item on the report of the Security Council.\r\nWe thank you, Sir, for having imparted leadership \r\nand momentum to this seemingly intractable debate \r\non Security Council reform by convening an advisory \r\ngroup that has been mandated to provide inputs in the \r\nform of options on the way forward, we hope by as \r\nearly as next week. The proposed input of your advisory \r\ngroup will help fill in the most critical missing link \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations thus far, which \r\nhas been the absence of a text. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations were mandated to commence text-based \r\nnegotiations, and therefore conducting negotiations in \r\na vacuum by repeatedly airing statements of known \r\npositions again and again and then going back to the \r\ndrawing board belies the mandate and is simply not \r\nleading to progress.\r\nText-based negotiations were also the way forward \r\nproposed by the Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in his letter of 25 July 2012, in which he \r\nclearly outlined the need for the production of a concise \r\nworking document that would become the basis for real \r\ngive-and-take negotiations.\r\nThe most recent meeting of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, on 27 June, also heard 33 of the \r\n44 speakers ask specifically for the convening of text-\r\nbased negotiations, with several delegations calling for \r\nthese as the only next logical step, and for the text to \r\nrecognize the imperative of expansion in both categories \r\nof membership, a proposal that has already received the \r\noverwhelming support of the larger membership from \r\nthe f loor of the intergovernmental negotiations. This, \r\ntoo, was recognized in the Chair’s own assessment of \r\n25 July 2012.\r\nWe therefore laud your initiative, Sir, to inject \r\nmomentum into this debate by convening an advisory \r\ngroup to produce an input for the start of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations by 15 November. We \r\nare assured that the intergovernmental negotiations can \r\nmake tangible progress under your able stewardship this \r\nyear on the basis of the President’s text that is currently \r\nbeing discussed by the advisory group. A select few, \r\nhowever, appear to be holding the larger membership \r\nhostage in order to prevent it from making any kind \r\nof movement forward. Challenging the authority of a \r\nPresident of the General Assembly who was collectively \r\nand unanimously elected does not bode well for that \r\nGeneral Assembly to function effectively as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nI close by expressing the fervent hope of \r\nthe Caribbean Community that under your able \r\nstewardship, Sir, the General Assembly will be able \r\nto cross the Rubicon in our quest for a reform of the \r\nSecurity Council that will make it more broadly \r\nrepresentative, efficient, transparent and accountable. \r\nWithout such reform, the effectiveness, legitimacy and \r\nimplementation of the Council’s decisions will likely \r\nwane with the passage of time.\r\nAs was the case 50 years ago and throughout the \r\nprocess of consideration of this important issue, the \r\nconstructive engagement of CARICOM member States \r\nwill be on the side of meaningful reform.\r\nMr. Bart (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I take the f loor \r\ntoday on behalf of the L.69 group on agenda item 123, \r\n“Question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters”.\r\nI have the honour to take the f loor today on behalf \r\na diverse group of 42 developing countries from Africa, \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, and Asia and the \r\nPacific that are united by a common cause — to achieve \r\nlasting and comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Our group is bound by the firm conviction that \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership of the Security Council \r\nis imperative to better reflect contemporary world \r\nrealities and achieve a more accountable, representative, \r\ntransparent and, more importantly, relevant Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nWe congratulate you, Sir, on your election as the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession, and we also compliment you for reappointing \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, as the Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to lead us forward on this important \r\ndebate. His reappointment is a welcome reflection \r\nof the collective trust invested in him by the wider \r\nmembership of the United Nations and, as rightly \r\npointed out in your letter, helps maintain continuity \r\nbased on institutional memory of the history of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nLet me clarify that this statement pertains only to \r\nagenda item 123, “Question of equitable representation \r\n12/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nwho addressed the General Assembly from this very \r\nrostrum in the general debate at the Assembly’s sixty-\r\neighth session called categorically for speedy reform of \r\nthe Council. We must therefore deliver on our leaders’ \r\nmandate by working towards a text-based process that \r\ncan deliver concrete outcomes in 2015. Failure to do so \r\nwill be seen as a collective failure to deliver on what all \r\nour leaders signed on to in 2005.\r\nAs the only group whose membership has \r\nincreased over the years, and in keeping with our \r\ntradition of active support for the reform process, the \r\nL.69 Group has also put forward a number of proposals \r\nfor transforming our interactions and deliberations into \r\nreal negotiations. We hope that the advisory group will \r\nfactor the L.69’s proposals into its inputs. As a group \r\nwith perhaps the largest convergence of like-minded \r\ncountries from the developing world, the L.69 has been \r\nable to significantly enhance its convergence with the \r\nAfrican Group and forge a common position. It is a \r\nposition that embraces comprehensive reforms and \r\nhas deliberately avoided the piecemeal approach that \r\nsome of the detractors of any forward movement on \r\nreforms have used to hold the process hostage. Let me \r\nreiterate that the L.69 acknowledges and supports the \r\nAfrican shared position as enunciated in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus. Such enhancement of convergence benefits \r\nthe momentum contributing to the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process, which should also be recognized \r\nin the input of the President’s advisory group.\r\nToday, when we see the Security Council’s inability \r\nto respond in a timely manner to pressing issues of \r\nwar and peace; when we see Council decisions being \r\nincreasingly exposed to scrutiny by the public and large \r\nsections of civil society and academia, who question \r\nnot just its representativeness but its credibility, even \r\nto the extent of Member States rejecting seats on \r\nthe Council, we should be seen to be constructively \r\nengaged in restoring the dignity of that premier body \r\nby reforming it to reflect contemporary realities. Your \r\ninitiative, Mr. President, is therefore a most welcome \r\nopportunity for us all to seize the present momentum \r\nand drive the intergovernmental negotiations process to \r\nits logical conclusion.\r\nThe L.69 Group is committed to playing its part \r\nin ensuring that the result we all envisage is not left \r\nto future generations, but brought about now and here, \r\nunder your able stewardship, Mr. President.\r\nbody, particularly when the President has clarified that \r\nthe group’s role is purely advisory in nature and does \r\nnot have a negotiating role.\r\nWe therefore urge you, Mr. President, to take the \r\nprocess you have embarked on to its logical conclusion, \r\nbecause in doing so you have the full support of the \r\noverwhelming majority of the membership. The efforts \r\nof a few perpetual naysayers to any progress, if they \r\nsucceed in any way in scuttling your initiative, will be \r\nonly a bump in the road for any forward movement. \r\nYou have all the authority necessary for the successful \r\ncompletion of your initiative. It is important that these \r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform do not go on \r\nad infinitum. We submit that consideration should be \r\ngiven to conducting these discussions within some sort \r\nof time frame.\r\nIt was in 1963, 50 years ago, that the most recent \r\nexpansion enlarged the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil from 11 to 15 — a modest increase of four, \r\nin the non-permanent category only. Since then the \r\nmembership of the United Nations has increased from \r\n113 to 193. Eighty Members have been added, but \r\nthat has not altered by an inch the composition of the \r\nOrganization’s premier body mandated to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. We are in a truly \r\nbizarre position, where nearly 75 per cent of the work \r\nof the Security Council is focused exclusively on the \r\ncontinent of Africa and yet since its inception that \r\nbody has not had even one permanent member from the \r\nwhole of the 53-strong African continent. It is therefore \r\ncritical that we move ahead with a results-based timeline \r\nas an absolute imperative. Failure to do so would be \r\nseen only as stalling any progress, and all through the \r\nself-defeating plea of not imposing artificial timelines.\r\nIt is our Group’s firm conviction that 2015 — which \r\nwill witness the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, as well as being 10 years since the 2005 World \r\nSummit, when all our Heads of States and Government \r\nmandated us to reform the Security Council as soon \r\nas possible — would be the right occasion to deliver \r\nconcrete outcomes on this pressing subject. Eight years \r\nhave elapsed since we were mandated by our Heads \r\nof State in paragraph 153 of the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1) to reform the Security \r\nCouncil as soon as possible in order to make it more \r\nbroadly representative, efficient and transparent, \r\nand thus enhance its effectiveness and legitimacy \r\nin implementing its decisions. Seventy-nine of the \r\napproximately 120 Heads of State and Government \r\n13-55224 13/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nbehalf of and for the entire African continent. It is not \r\nthe same individual pursuit of power and privilege that \r\nit is for others. We appreciate that the strength of the \r\nAfrican position results from its unity and consensus. \r\nWe also believe in regional ownership and consensus \r\nand therefore respect that position. We remain ready \r\nto continue working with Africa in promoting equal \r\nand non-discriminatory approaches for all groups with \r\nregard to their representation on the Council.\r\nThe Security Council, in line with decision \r\n62/557, needs comprehensive reform based on all five \r\ninterrelated clusters: categories of membership, the \r\nveto, size and working methods, regional representation, \r\nand the relationship between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly. Nobody would benefit from a \r\npiecemeal approach or rushed solutions motivated \r\nmainly by the desire to increase the number of seats in \r\nthe Security Council. We should not repeat the mistakes \r\nmade in the past, when attempts to push through hurried \r\nand divisive solutions both failed and made the entire \r\nreform exercise even more complicated.\r\nIn your opening remarks, Mr. President, you \r\nmentioned the need to compromise. Uniting for \r\nConsensus is the only negotiating group that has \r\nalready officially tabled two concrete proposals \r\nfor Security Council reform, in 2005 and in 2009, \r\nfor the purpose of contributing actively to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process, suggesting, \r\nfor example, the allocation of long-term non-permanent \r\nseats on a regional basis. Uniting for Consensus is \r\nopen to considering other new ideas for the purpose of \r\nbridging the gap with other groups, taking into account \r\neveryone’s proposals and legitimate aspirations.\r\nLet me reiterate the full commitment of Uniting for \r\nConsensus to decision 62/557, also with respect to the \r\nprinciple that the intergovernmental negotiations are \r\nthe only legitimate forum to take decisions on Security \r\nCouncil reform and find a solution that can garner \r\nthe widest possible acceptance. In that respect, with \r\nreference to the recent decision of creating an advisory \r\ngroup to the President of the General Assembly on the \r\nSecurity Council reform process, Uniting for Consensus \r\nmembers have already conveyed their assessment \r\nin their letter of 21 October, which you, Sir, kindly \r\nagreed to respond to by meeting with us yesterday. \r\nYou stressed the fact that the group would have only \r\na consultative purpose and not be representative of \r\nany of the negotiating parties, that the advisory group \r\nwould not have a negotiating role or a mandate to draft \r\nMr. Bernardini (Italy): On behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus Group, I would first like to express our \r\nappreciation to you, Mr. President, for reiterating your \r\ndesire to make reform of the Security Council a priority \r\nfor your mandate. As your letter of 22 October states, \r\nthis issue is an important element in our overall effort \r\nto strengthen the United Nations Organization. That \r\neffort, I would add, is now more urgent than ever as we \r\nnear the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nand as the Security Council faces more compelling \r\nand challenging times. The future and credibility of \r\nthe entire United Nations system will depend on what I \r\nhope we will be able to do.\r\nWe also wish to join previous speakers in thanking \r\nChina for presenting the Security Council’s annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly (A/68/2) and the United \r\nStates for preparing its introduction.\r\nThese many years of negotiations have not passed \r\nin vain. We have shared our views, in a transparent and \r\ncollegial way, on a particularly thorny issue that is of \r\ninterest to the entire membership. Dialogue, when open \r\nand genuine, is always constructive, even if there are \r\ndifferences. It is precisely in awareness and full respect \r\nof those persistent divisions among the membership, not \r\nonly on the substance of Security Council reform, but \r\nalso with regard to how to move the process forward, \r\nthat I would like to briefly summarize the key elements \r\nof the proposal of the Uniting for Consensus Group.\r\nWe remain absolutely convinced that the creation \r\nof new permanent individual members would be a \r\nmistake. We invite the entire membership to carefully \r\nweigh the consequences of such a solution. In our view, \r\nthat approach would not be in line with the interests of \r\nthe vast majority of Member States from all regional \r\ngroups. It would in fact benefit only a handful of the \r\n193 Member States, and it would not be a step towards \r\na more democratic Security Council. Such an outcome \r\nwould add another unjustifiable layer of hierarchy \r\nnot only within single regional groups but also in the \r\nlarger framework of the international community, \r\nexacerbating rather than reconciling severe differences \r\nand divisions.\r\nUniting for Consensus understands the aspirations \r\nof the African Group for equitable representation and \r\nits desire to play its rightful role in the work of the \r\nCouncil. We recognize in particular that the African \r\ndemand for equal rights and for a solution to the problem \r\nof its historic underrepresentation is a demand on \r\n14/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nMr. van Oosterom (Netherlands): I have the \r\npleasure to speak on behalf of the Kingdom of Belgium \r\nand the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nI thank you, Sir, for your timely convening of this \r\nannual debate of the General Assembly on Security \r\nCouncil reform. I would also like to thank you for your \r\nletters of 22 October and 6 November and for putting \r\nthis issue back on the agenda. We commend your \r\ndecision to reappoint Ambassador Tanin. We believe he \r\ndeserves praise for his constructive and energetic role \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nover the past few years, and we are convinced that he \r\nwill continue the good work.\r\nThe intergovernmental process indeed needed an \r\nearly resumption. We support your idea, Sir, to produce a \r\nbasis for the start of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome the establishment of an \r\nadvisory group. We hope that your determination can \r\ncreate a new momentum, because the ultimate goal \r\nof our endeavour — a more effective, transparent \r\nand representative Security Council that reflects the \r\ngeopolitical realities of the twenty-first century and \r\ncontributes to a more credible United Nations and a \r\nreinforced international system — remains as important \r\nas ever.\r\nThe main ideas about Security Council reform \r\nfrom the different groups in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are well known. Some are shared by a vast \r\nmajority of Member States, including Belgium and the \r\nNetherlands. For instance, we believe that there should \r\nbe an expansion of the Council in both categories of \r\nmembership, permanent and non-permanent. Other \r\nideas and proposals are more recent but deserve our \r\ncareful attention. In particular, support of the French \r\nproposal of a code of conduct for the voluntary limitation \r\nof the use of the veto right in case of mass atrocities \r\ncomes to mind. It is both ambitious and heartening. We \r\nencourage the other permanent members of the Council \r\nto consider it with an open mind.\r\nWhatever the proposals on the table, Belgium and \r\nthe Netherlands would like to stress that all Member \r\nStates should be genuinely willing to engage in a \r\nprocess of give and take. Compromises will be required \r\nof all of us. There is no alternative, should we indeed \r\nwant to make progress. We have said it many times \r\nbefore — we need to take action to change the status \r\nquo.\r\nor streamline any negotiating document or a basis for \r\nnegotiations, and, lastly, that the advisory group would \r\nnot overlap or substitute for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We thank you for those clarifications.\r\nOn the other hand, as we mentioned yesterday, \r\nthere are still conflicting interpretations of the group’s \r\nmandate and some of them, stated publicly this morning \r\nby some Member States, do not seem to ensure the \r\nbalance, equity, accountability and transparency that an \r\nissue of such complexity would require. In that regard, \r\nwe draw the Assembly’s attention to our aforementioned \r\nletter on the composition of the advisory group and its \r\nmandate as mentioned in your communication. Thus, \r\nas a group that has hinged its negotiating activities on \r\nthe respect of those principles, we deem it crucial to \r\nreiterate today, before the entire membership, the firm \r\nposition of Uniting for Consensus on the matter.\r\nIn particular, the members of the advisory group, \r\ngiven their undeniable experience and professionalism, \r\nwill undoubtedly be able to provide the President with \r\na useful contribution of ideas. We underscore that \r\nsuch a group cannot bypass the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process and the framework provided by \r\ndecision 62/557, as well as subsequent decisions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and that it must not jeopardize the \r\nmembership-driven nature of the process. Therefore, \r\nwe do not recognize the group as entitled to perform \r\nany drafting role on behalf of Member States, including \r\nimposing any kind of negotiating text on behalf of \r\nothers. That would indeed go fully counter to the \r\nmembership-driven nature of the process.\r\nAllow me to conclude by stressing that any future \r\nsolution to the Security Council reform process will \r\nrequire bold leadership and willingness on the part \r\nof our Governments to compromise. That approach \r\nhas been at the core of Uniting for Consensus’s \r\nengagement in all nine previous negotiating sessions \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. Unfortunately, \r\nbut frankly, our efforts have not been reciprocated so \r\nfar. Nevertheless, let me reaffirm, on behalf of the \r\nentire Uniting for Consensus group, that we also intend \r\nto maintain that stance at the next intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations sessions. We are determined to continue \r\nto engage with f lexibility and a genuine political \r\nopenness so that together we may update the Security \r\nCouncil to today’s new reality, increasing the Council’s \r\naccountability, transparency and effectiveness.\r\n13-55224 15/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nof the report when the debate under agenda item 29 is \r\nresumed on 21 November.\r\nMr. Manjeev Singh Puri (India): I am especially \r\nhonoured to speak here today. As I prepare to leave after \r\nfour and a half years at the Indian Mission to the United \r\nNations, it is a great honour for me to see as President \r\nof the General Assembly someone whom I have always \r\nseen as a leader and who has been a great friend and \r\nmentor to me. I am very honoured, Sir, to speak here \r\ntoday as you preside over this meeting. Our delegation \r\nat the highest level has of course congratulated you \r\nand offered its fullest support. Please allow me at the \r\npersonal level also to congratulate you and to offer \r\nthe full support of our delegation as you conduct the \r\nbusiness of the current session.\r\nWe very much welcome your initiatives and your \r\nleadership, Mr. President, to strongly invigorate the \r\nprocess of Security Council reform. As my colleague \r\nfrom the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has said, \r\nthis is one of the most important issues before the \r\nOrganization today.\r\nWe would also like to thank the representative of \r\nChina for presenting the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/68/2).\r\nThe main purpose of my statement today is to \r\naddress the issue of equitable representation on and \r\nan increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other related matters. At the outset, I would like to \r\nwelcome the the reappointment of Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nwhich is a most positive development and brings much-\r\nneeded institutional continuity to this debate.\r\nBefore I delve into the substance of my remarks, \r\nallow me to align myself with the statements delivered \r\nearlier by the representative of Japan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Four, and by the representative of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis on behalf of the L.69 group. I would also like \r\nto lend my fullest support to the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of Guyana on behalf of CARICOM \r\nand would request all of those present to pay special \r\nheed to what he said.\r\nHaving closely followed the debate on the reform \r\nof the Security Council over the past four and a half \r\nyears in New York, as well as for nearly a decade before \r\nthat, I would like to submit a few myth-busters to set \r\nthe record straight on some of the key issues that have \r\nrecently been raised.\r\nAfter the conclusion of today’s general debate, \r\nwe will be looking forward to the first meeting of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. It will allow us \r\nto go into more detail. We hope it will set the stage \r\nfor concrete, informed and conclusive negotiations. \r\nBelgium and the Netherlands assure you, Sir, and the \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations of our \r\nfull support for any genuine effort that can lead to real \r\nprogress.\r\nMr. Guerber (Switzerland): I am pleased to take \r\nthe f loor in my capacity as the coordinator of the \r\naccountability, coherence and transparency (ACT) \r\ngroup, a cross-regional group of 22 States, to make \r\na brief statement in relation only to agenda item 29, \r\nentitled “Report of the Security Council”.\r\nACT is currently composed of Austria, Chile, \r\nCosta Rica, Estonia, Finland, Gabon, Hungary, Ireland, \r\nJordan, Lichtenstein, Maldives, New Zealand, Norway, \r\nPapua New Guinea, Peru, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, \r\nSlovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Tanzania and Uruguay. \r\nThe group was launched in May as a new initiative to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council. \r\nThe name group’s name — and acronym — reflects our \r\ncommon conviction that those qualities are needed in \r\nall the Security Council’s activities.\r\nACT wishes to thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nproviding us with this opportunity to discuss the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/68/2). This is \r\nthe key moment with respect to the interaction between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, and is \r\nan important point of reflection on what lies behind us.\r\nACT would also like to thank the representative \r\nof China, in his capacity as President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, for introducing the \r\nreport to the wider membership.\r\nACT strongly believes that the content of the \r\nreport is of high importance and would welcome the \r\nopportunity to examine its content in depth before \r\ncommenting on it. We were therefore pleased to \r\nreceive assurances from the President’s Office that \r\nhe will convene a separate meeting at the end of \r\nNovember — presumably on 21 November — to allow \r\nmore thorough debate on agenda item 29. On behalf of \r\nACT, I wish to thank you, Sir, for giving Member States \r\nthe time necessary to thoroughly read and analyse the \r\nreport, thus enhancing the quality of the discussion. \r\nACT will deliver a detailed statement on the content \r\n16/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nto the position of any group, or as diluting it, nor as \r\nthe final word, for as and when such input is presented \r\nby the President to the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\neach and every Member State will have full authority \r\nto propose additions, deletions or amendments and to \r\nbuild upon the President’s initiative. But not even to let \r\nan input emerge and to cast aspersions does not reflect \r\nwell on any of us.\r\nA second myth that I would like to touch upon today \r\nis the often-cited need for complete consensus by the \r\nsame set of naysayers as being the only way forward.\r\nOn a matter as complex and pressing as Security \r\nCouncil reform, we all know that as and when it \r\nhappens it will eventually have to be tested from the \r\nf loor of the General Assembly through a vote. That is \r\nwhat the Charter of the United Nations prescribes. We \r\nalso agree and acknowledge that we are not there yet, \r\nbut to insist that no forward movement can take place \r\nuntil we have complete consensus is only tantamount to \r\ndelaying any kind of progress.\r\nTime and again, repeated articulations from all \r\nthe major stakeholders have proved from the f loor \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations, as well as the \r\nGeneral Assembly, that an overwhelming majority \r\nsupports expansion in both categories of membership. \r\nThat is also an observation made by the Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, having heard \r\nstatements from Member States over the past five \r\nyears. We therefore hope that the advisory group will \r\nfactor that into its input under consideration.\r\nThe third misplaced myth that I would like to \r\ntouch upon is the perceived apprehension that, through \r\nthe process of intergovernmental negotiations, some \r\ncountries will make it to the expanded setting, while \r\nothers will not. We are at present in a process that shall \r\nnot decide or indicate which countries would be members \r\nof the expanded setting. We are attempting only to \r\nnegotiate, through the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nthe broad parameters of what the expanded Security \r\nCouncil would be like and provide workable options on \r\neach of the five key issues identified in decision 62/557.\r\nThrough the 2005 World Summit, we have a \r\nmandate from our Heads of State that we need to \r\nfulfil. If we let the small yet vocal minority of counter-\r\naspirants to the aspirants scuttle this process going \r\nforward, then we will fail in our obligation to deliver \r\non that commitment.\r\nFirst, we have been involved in nine rounds of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations since 2009, all of them \r\nliterally conducted in the air. That might well be the \r\nonly instance of negotiations in a multilateral setting \r\nhaving been conducted so far without any text, which \r\ngoes against the very logic of multilateral diplomacy. \r\nThe process should have started off in the first instance \r\non the basis of a text. It seems to me that anyone who \r\nsays that we cannot move to text-based negotiations is \r\na naysayer to any forward movement. For if we do not \r\nnegotiate on the basis of a text, then on what basis do \r\nwe conduct negotiations?\r\nThe Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nhaving presided over eight rounds of negotiations over \r\nfive years, and having heard loud and clear the views \r\nof all interest groups and each Member State, came \r\nto that very conclusion in his letter of 25 July 2012, \r\nrecommending that, as in all other United Nations \r\nprocesses, he should be authorized to produce what he \r\ncalled a concise working document to enable the process \r\nto move towards real give-and-take negotiations. That \r\nplea received broad support from the f loor at the latest \r\nmeeting of the intergovernmental negotiations, held on \r\n27 June.\r\nWe subsequently learned, however, that a \r\nselect handful of naysayers protested the role of \r\nthe Chair and his recommendations, even though \r\nthose recommendations had been recognized in the \r\nAssembly’s rollover decision on the subject. To address \r\ntheir concern, the President of the General Assembly \r\nlater formed an advisory group to assist him in providing \r\ninput to become the basis for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, and that same group of naysayers are now \r\nquestioning his authority to do so. That is indeed an \r\noutright absurdity. One simply cannot have one’s cake \r\nand eat it too. It is our delegation’s firm belief that, \r\nhaving been unanimously elected, the President has \r\nfull authority to choose whom he wants as advisers, \r\nwhat and how to be advised on, and what to make of \r\nthat advice. I must, in that context, mention that I see \r\nAmbassador Noel Sinclair here and appreciate very \r\nmuch his role and efforts too.\r\nLet me reiterate that we welcome the President’s \r\ninitiative and hope that the input of the advisory group \r\nwill help us move forward on the basis of a text provided \r\nby the President of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to ask all Member States not to \r\nview text-based negotiations as necessarily inimical \r\n13-55224 17/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nchallenges arising in the international political arena \r\nrequire us to step up the negotiations and collectively to \r\nachieve a higher and nobler goal, including international \r\nconsensus and viable recommendations for improving \r\nthe working methods of the Council. These negotiations \r\nmust include most if not all States. \r\nIn recent years, our position vis-à-vis Security \r\nCouncil reform has remained firm and is based on the \r\nfollowing main principles.\r\nFirst, reform of the Security Council must take \r\nplace in accordance with a general vision embracing the \r\nongoing reform and improvement of all the organs of \r\nthe United Nations, and seeking more complementarity \r\nand balance in the work of the Organization. We \r\nshould focus on advancing the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the other organs, especialy \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, whose prerogatives must not be encroached \r\nupon. The Security Council’s role should be restricted \r\nto the tasks entrusted to it under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nSecondly, any idea on reforming the Security \r\nCouncil should be shaped by our desire to make the \r\nCouncil more representative of the overall membership \r\nof the Organization, which reflects an international \r\nreality that has changed considerably since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations in 1945.\r\nThirdly, it is important to continue improving the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council and adding \r\nfurther transparency and clarity to its work. Permanent \r\nrules of procedure must be adopted to improve and \r\nreorganize the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nFourthly, the veto must be exercised in accordance \r\nwith specific guidelines and controls. It should be used \r\nonly pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nFifthly, any increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council must be designed to give further \r\nopportunities to small States to contribute to the \r\nCouncil’s work. The rights of the Arab and Islamic \r\ncountries should not be disregarded in the representation, \r\ngiven their numbers, importance and contributions to \r\ndefending the purposes and principles of the Charter.\r\nWith regard to improving the working methods of \r\nthe Council, including calls for rationalizing the veto, \r\nThat brings me to my final submission. The exercise \r\nof Security Council reform cannot be seen to be going on \r\ntill the cows come home. Recent developments around \r\nthe world have increasingly brought into question not \r\njust the representativeness but also the credibility of the \r\nSecurity Council, and the clarion call for change is only \r\ngrowing louder by the day.\r\nAll those are important tidings that cannot be \r\nignored in our collective quest to achieve Security \r\nCouncil reform. We need to have a results-based \r\ntimeline, and the year 2015 — which will be the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations and mark \r\ntenth year since the 2005 World Summit, when all our \r\nHeads of State and Government mandated us to achieve \r\nearly reforms of the Security Council — will be an \r\nimportant occasion for delivering concrete outcomes \r\non that most pressing subject.\r\nWe hope that we can collectively work together in \r\na constructive and forward-looking manner, not just on \r\nthe process but on the substance as well, in the interim, \r\nto deliver on that long-due mandate. Mr. President, \r\nyour initiative and personal commitment are most \r\nappreciated, and in your success lies our collective \r\nendeavour.\r\nMr. Al-Otaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to extend our thanks and \r\nappreciation to the President of the Security Council, \r\nMr. Liu Jieyi, Permanent Representative of China, \r\nfor introducing the Council’s annual report (A/68/2), \r\nfor the period 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013. I also \r\nwould like to thank the United States for preparing the \r\nintroduction to the report and for its increased activities \r\nin the Council.\r\nWe congratulate our friends the new non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council for the term 2014-\r\n2015. We express our support for the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, and welcome the efforts of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin in his capacity as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. We hope that he \r\nwill achieve progress towards Security Council reform \r\nand fulfil the long-awaited aspiration and hopes to \r\nreactivate and enhance the role of the Council.\r\nMore than 20 years have elapsed since discussions \r\nbegan on expanding and improving the modus operandi \r\nof the Council, yet the case is still faltering and requires \r\nthe political will to bring views together in order to \r\nachieve the desired goals. The ever-more-frequent \r\n18/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\naffecting international peace and security. Despite \r\nall the politicized criticism, an objective comparative \r\nanalysis reveals that the Council is one of the most \r\neffective international institutions.\r\nReforming the Security Council is clearly very \r\nimportant, but it should not be allowed to detract from \r\nthe ability of the Council and the General Assembly to \r\nresolve real global challenges so as to avoid problems \r\nin the future. Let us not assume that a broader Security \r\nCouncil would be more able to find the appropriate \r\nsolutions. It would more than likely complicate that \r\nprocess. In considering specific reforms of the Security \r\nCouncil, we should ask ourselves if they would genuinely \r\nlead to a more balanced Council or to a fragmented \r\nbody in which certain regions and States are favoured \r\nat the expense of others. Would a reformed Council be \r\nequipped to deal with a fast-changing world?\r\nRussia has championed making the Security Council \r\na more representative body. However, such efforts \r\nshould not affect the Council’s ability to respond to \r\nemerging crises and challenges rapidly and effectively, \r\nall the more pressing today as we witness a growing \r\nnumber of conflicts throughout the world. We are in \r\nfavour of keeping the Council as it is, namely, compact. \r\nIts optimal number should not exceed 20 members. \r\nIn our view, it would be unacceptable to restrict the \r\nprerogatives of the permanent five members, such as the \r\nveto, which are a reflection of the historic contribution \r\nmade by the permanent five to the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations. I should also like to recall that the veto \r\nis an important factor that has prompted members of \r\nthe Security Council to find balanced solutions, and \r\ninfringing on that prerogative would be wrong from \r\nboth the historical and the political points of view. The \r\nright of veto has in the past allowed us to avoid taking \r\ndecisions that would have advanced the political agenda \r\nof a single group of States, thereby complicating efforts \r\nto resolve problems that required rapid and appropriate \r\nsolutions.\r\nWe, like many others, fully support the idea of a \r\nCouncil reform process that would belong entirely to \r\nMember States. In that regard, we are doubtful about \r\na non-transparent practice involving the creation of \r\nvarious groups with limited membership that, without a \r\nmandate from the General Assembly to do so, would seek \r\nto find grounds for continuing the negotiations. That \r\nwould lead to more division among Member States, and \r\nwe doubt that it would encourage a constructive reform \r\nprocess. The General Assembly is, of course, free to \r\nwe welcome French President Hollande’s proposal \r\nwhereby the five permanent members would voluntarily \r\nabstain from using the veto in cases of crimes against \r\nhumanity. In that context, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation for, and understanding of, the position of \r\nSaudi Arabia with regard to membership on the Council. \r\nWe share its resentment over the Council’s impotence \r\nin fulfilling its responsibilities and commitments \r\nvis-à-vis the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, particularly with respect to Arab and Islamic \r\nissues.\r\nMy delegation expresses its backing of the letter \r\nof 31 October addressed by Bahrain, the Chair of \r\nthe Arab Group, to the President of the General \r\nAssembly, emphasizing the position of the members \r\nof the League of Arab States with regard to reform \r\nof the Security Council that a permanent seat should \r\nbe assigned to the Arab Group in accordance with the \r\ncompendium document presented by the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are the only forum for reaching agreement \r\non expanding the reform of the Security Council in \r\naccordance with decision 62/557. \r\nThe rapid challenges and intertwined issues facing \r\nthe international community compel us to persist in \r\nand insistent on intensifying efforts to promote and \r\nreactivate the role and effectiveness of the Security \r\nCouncil in order to enable it to meet the challenges \r\nbefore it and to be more representative, transparent, \r\ncredible and impartial.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We welcome today’s meeting, which gives \r\nall Member States a good opportunity to discuss the \r\nSecurity Council and its work, as well as the efforts to \r\nreform the Council. Such transparent discussions are \r\nextremely important. We are grateful to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of China, Ambassador Liu Jieyi, who as \r\nPresident of the Security Council this month introduced \r\nthe Council’s annual report (A/68/2).\r\nWe would also like to thank the delegation of the \r\nUnited States of America, which carried out significant \r\nwork in preparing and elaborating the report. On the \r\nwhole, it ref lects objectively the work of the Council \r\nover the past year. The Council has continued to work \r\nactively towards resolving today’s most pressing \r\nchallenges, a fact that demonstrates the Council’s \r\nunique legitimacy in the eyes of the international \r\ncommunity as the body charged with settling disputes \r\n13-55224 19/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nprocess on this issue within the framework of a General \r\nAssembly mandate, as stated in decision 62/557.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the facilitator \r\nof the negotiations, the Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, Mr Tanin, for his tireless efforts in \r\ncoordinating discussions on Security Council reform \r\nand to congratulate him upon the renewal of his \r\nmandate during this session. \r\nThe delegation of my country associates itself \r\nin that connection with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Sierra Leone, on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, and of Egypt, on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nAs the world undergoes profound geostrategic \r\nchanges, almost all countries now recognize the need \r\nto readjust international relations and the dynamics \r\ngoverning them to current international and regional \r\nrealities. The Security Council, which is at the very \r\nheart of those dynamics as the body charged with \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, cannot \r\nbe spared from such reform. The Security Council \r\nmust be reformed so as to enable us to bolster its \r\neffectiveness and its ability to function, fully assuming \r\nits responsibilities on behalf of all Member States in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nTunisia, which has participated in various \r\npeacekeeping operations since the 1960s, and which \r\nhas contributed to conflict resolution through its \r\ncontingents and its diplomacy, knows well the \r\nchallenges of war and hotbeds of tensions. My country \r\nremains convinced that a Security Council with such \r\na restrictive composition and such rigid mechanisms \r\nas today would find it difficult to meet the current \r\nneeds for rapid, effective and appropriate intervention \r\nin emerging conflicts or the aspirations of peoples \r\nall over the world who see in the United Nations and \r\nits executive body the only recourse when hope has \r\nvanished. The hotbeds of tension in the Middle East, \r\nboth long-standing and new, are the best illustration of \r\nthat.\r\nWithin that framework, my delegation would like \r\nto reiterate its support for efforts undertaken within \r\nthe framework of intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nthe question of equitable representation on the Security \r\nCouncil. The goal of such efforts is to reach, in a \r\ntransparent and inclusive manner, a consensus solution \r\nthat would enjoy the broadest possible political support \r\nof Member States.\r\nlisten to advice of various kinds, as long as it does not \r\nimpose those views on Members trying to negotiate \r\nreform of the Security Council. We are convinced \r\nthat the Security Council cannot be reformed through \r\narithmetic by establishing various voting models for \r\nobtaining the minimum necessary number of votes. \r\nThat would neither boost the Security Council’s \r\nauthority nor strengthen the world Organization.\r\nIf we cannot reach consensus on reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, we certainly need, for political \r\nreasons, to gain the overwhelming support of Member \r\nStates, certainly more than the minimum two-thirds \r\nmajority vote offered by the General Assembly. We \r\nare prepared to look into reasonable options, including \r\ninterim and compromise solutions, for expanding the \r\nSecurity Council, provided that they enjoy the broadest \r\npossible support of Members of the Organization. \r\nTalks have shown that we are not getting any closer to \r\na comprehensive formula for reforming the Security \r\nCouncil that could enjoy the broadest possible support. \r\nThere is no common understanding, which makes it \r\nimpossible to go forward with substantive work.\r\nIn such circumstances, we see no other alternative \r\nbut to work towards converging the outcomes of talks \r\nduring the Assembly. We anticipate that the efforts of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, Mr. John Ashe, \r\nand the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, \r\nAmbassador Tanin, who is mediating the talks, will \r\nprovide all the assistance required, on the understanding \r\nthat the negotiation process remains firmly in the hands \r\nof Member States.  We are convinced that such work \r\nmust take place in a calm, transparent and inclusive \r\nmanner, devoid of tentative time frames, since it is of \r\nthe utmost importance to ensure that Member States of \r\nthe United Nations make the right decision.\r\nIn conclusion, we believe that progress in reforming \r\nthe Security Council hinges solely on the political \r\nwill of Member States and their readiness to reach a \r\nreasonable compromise.\r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to thank the Permanant Representative \r\nof China for introducing the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/68/2) and the delegation of the United \r\nStates for contributing to its elaboration. I would like to \r\nconvey to you, Mr. President, my heartfelt gratitude for \r\nmaking the reform of the Security Council one of your \r\npriorities. I assure the Assembly of my country’s firm \r\nsupport for any effort to advance an intergovernmental \r\n20/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nto highlight our clear commitment to reforming the \r\nSecurity Council so that it is more representative of \r\nthe modern world. We know that the vast majority of \r\nMember States share that overarching aim. However, \r\nthe proposals for what shape the reform should take \r\ndiffer and will require genuine negotiation to find a \r\ncommon view. It is time for that negotiation to start.\r\nThe United Kingdom supports broadening Council \r\nmembership to include permanent seats for Brazil, \r\nGermany, India and Japan, along with permanent \r\nAfrican representation. We also support the expansion \r\nin the non-permanent category of members. But while \r\nour positive position on reform is well established, we \r\nnonetheless welcome new initiatives that can provide \r\nmuch needed momentum to the reform debate, and we \r\nremain willing to work with all parties and groups that \r\nshare that commitment.\r\nIn that spirit, we welcome the reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Tanin as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. He has worked tirelessly in that role, and \r\nwe support his continued efforts to find a way forward \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations. We also welcome \r\nyour initiative, Mr. President, to create an advisory \r\ngroup and we look forward to discussing their ideas \r\nand proposals with the wider membership. The key to \r\nunlocking progress on reform is to establish a common \r\nposition from which we can all move forward together.\r\nWe note the French proposal on the use of the veto \r\nand agree that it is essential that the Security Council \r\nact to stop mass atrocities and crimes against humanity. \r\nFor our part, the United Kingdom cannot envisage \r\ncircumstances where we would use our veto to block \r\naction to avert a mass atrocity or to stop crimes against \r\nhumanity. We will continue to work within the Council \r\nto ensure that it meets its responsibilities, as set out in \r\nthe Charter, and with the wider membership for a reform \r\nof the Council that both makes it more representative \r\nand enhances its effectiveness.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm \r\nthe United Kingdom’s commitment to improving the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods and its efforts \r\nin that regard. Much has been achieved in the past \r\nfew years to improve both the transparency and the \r\neffectiveness of the Security Council, including more \r\nopen debates. We heard from my Chinese colleague that \r\nthere were 174 open meetings of the Security Council \r\nin the past 12 months. There have been more Arria-\r\nstyle meetings and an increased use of videoconference \r\nIn the same context, Tunisia welcomes the \r\ncommitment expressed by the President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. John Ashe, in his letters addressed \r\nto Member States to step up efforts to give a new \r\nimpetus to the intergovernmental negotiations process. \r\nThat should remain the sole appropriate institutional \r\nframework mandated by the General Assembly to deal \r\nwith the issue of Security Council reform.\r\nWe believe that the ultimate aim of any Security \r\nCouncil reform must be to strengthen equitable \r\nrepresentation within that body. That will enable the \r\nCouncil to acquire the necessary legitimacy to act on \r\nbehalf of the international community. That objective \r\ncan be achieved only if the restructured Security \r\nCouncil ref lects all viewpoints of the international \r\ncommunity and gives developing countries in particular \r\ntheir rightful place on the Security Council.\r\nIn that context, Tunisia continues to strongly \r\nsupport the position of the African Union, as reflected \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus. We believe that it is time \r\nto redress the current situation whereby the African \r\ncontinent remains deprived of a permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council. The same goes for the Arab region. \r\nThat is why my country also supports the position of the \r\nArab Group, as contained in the summary document of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council must be \r\ncomprehensive, transparent and balanced. We must \r\nensure that the Council agenda reflects the needs and \r\ninterests of both developed and developing countries \r\nin an objective, rational and non-selective manner. All \r\nsubstantive issues must be addressed, including its \r\ncomposition, regional representation, agenda, working \r\nmethods and decision-making process, including the \r\nright of veto. The reform must also take into account \r\nthe relationships between the Security Council and the \r\nother principal organs of the United Nations, as well \r\nas full respect by the Council for the prerogatives and \r\nfunctions of each of those bodies, in particular the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Such issues should be accorded the \r\nsame importance and consistency as other categories of \r\nthe reform.\r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): I would \r\nlike to thank the Permanent Representative of China for \r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council (A/68/2) \r\nthis morning.\r\nThe United Kingdom is pleased to make a statement \r\non Security Council reform. It is an opportunity for us \r\n13-55224 21/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\ninternational peace and security, the efforts of regional \r\norganizations to take ownership and to resolve their \r\nown issues should be strongly supported. The continued \r\nengagement of the AU Peace and Security Council on \r\nthe pending issues between the Sudan and South Sudan \r\nis a case that underlines that point.\r\nAmong the work of the Council in other regions, \r\nthe completion of the mandate of the United Nations \r\nIntegrated Mission in Timor-Leste last year is a \r\ntestament to what the international community can \r\nachieve by working together and is the model of a \r\nsuccessful exit strategy.\r\nNotwithstanding the progress made, the situation \r\nin Syria continues to be the biggest challenge facing \r\nthe Council. Too much bloodshed has occurred, and we \r\nare deeply concerned about the continued violations of \r\nhuman rights and the deterioration of the humanitarian \r\nsituation in Syria. The Security Council was only \r\nrecently able to adopt resolution 2118 (2013) on chemical \r\nweapons and to issue a presidential statement on the \r\nhumanitarian situation (S/PRST/2013/15). While their \r\nfull implementation is a vital requirement, a political \r\nsettlement should end the crisis without further delay. \r\nWe urge that a “Geneva II” conference be held as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nAnother continuing issue for the Security Council \r\nis the process aimed at achieving peace between Israel \r\nand Palestine. The Republic of Korea supports a two-\r\nState solution, which envisages both the Israeli and \r\nPalestinian peoples living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. We hope that the two sides remain firmly \r\ncommitted and reach an agreement within the agreed \r\ntime frame.\r\nTurning to the area of non-proliferation, the \r\nCouncil took robust action against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s December 2012 launch \r\nusing ballistic missile technology, and its third nuclear \r\ntest, in February of this year. Resolutions 2087 (2013) \r\nand 2094 (2013) strongly condemned those actions as \r\nviolations of the Council’s relevant resolutions, and \r\nfurther strengthened the sanctions regime on North \r\nKorea. The adoption of those resolutions has reaffirmed \r\nthe Council’s credibility and authority in preserving \r\ninternational peace and security and upholding the \r\nprinciple of non-proliferation. The work of the Security \r\nCouncil Committee established pursuant to resolution \r\n1718 (2006) has been instrumental in that regard.\r\nfacilities. At the Council debate on working methods on \r\n29 October (see S/PV.7052), I suggested measures for \r\nimproving the Council’s efficiency, including keeping \r\ninterventions to the allotted time, and advocated that the \r\nCouncil expand its work on conflict prevention through \r\nmechanisms already at its disposal, such as horizon \r\nscanning. We will continue to make such proposals in \r\nthe belief that an effective and transparent Council is in \r\nthe interest of all Member States.\r\nMr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation to you, Sir, as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, for convening this meeting. I also \r\nthank Ambassador Liu Jieyi of China for introducing \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/68/2) on \r\nbehalf of the Council.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Council’s daily \r\nefforts to fulfil its mandate to maintain peace and \r\nsecurity covered virtually all regions of the world. \r\nAfrican issues remained at the forefront, representing \r\nmore than 60 per cent of the Council’s work. The \r\nCouncil’s vigorous engagement was essential in \r\nbringing positive developments in countries such as the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and Somalia.\r\nPeacekeeping operations proved in most cases to be \r\neffective in advancing peace and security in Africa. The \r\nCouncil has reaffirmed its commitment to enhancing \r\nstability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by \r\nauthorizing the deployment of the Intervention Brigade \r\nwithin the United Nations Organization Stabilization \r\nMission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nthrough resolution 2098 (2013).\r\nIn Mali, the adoption of resolution 2100 (2013), \r\nwhich established the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, represented a \r\nsignificant step in improving the security situation and \r\nin accelerating the political process in that country.\r\nOn Somalia, we value the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Somalia through \r\nresolution 2102 (2013) with a mandate to support the \r\npeace and reconciliation efforts of the Government of \r\nSomalia.\r\nSuch achievements would not have been possible \r\nwithout the Council’s constructive engagement with \r\nregional and subregional organizations, such as the \r\nAfrican Union (AU) and the Economic Community \r\nof West African States. While the Security Council \r\nhas the primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\n22/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nis of critical importance for the future of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, as a current non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, will continue its efforts \r\nto realize a more accountable and efficient Council.\r\nMrs. DiCarlo (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to participate in this annual \r\nplenary debate on the important topic of Security \r\nCouncil reform. First, however, I would like to thank \r\nthe President of the Security Council, Ambassador Liu \r\nJieyi of China, for his introduction to the Council’s \r\nannual report to the General Assembly (A/68/2). The \r\nreport, a requirement under Articles 15 and 24 of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, ensures that all \r\nMember States can be kept apprised of the Council’s \r\nwork throughout the reporting period. This year, the \r\nUnited States delegation was responsible for preparing \r\nthe introduction of the annual report. One of our goals \r\nwas to keep it as concise and readable as possible, \r\nwhile also summarizing the large amount of content. \r\nMy delegation thanks the current and former Council \r\nmembers who assisted in that task.\r\nToday’s debate occurs just before the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the creation of the Open-ended Working \r\nGroup on Security Council Reform in December 1993, \r\nwhen we adopted resolution 48/26 by consensus. \r\nSince then, 79 different Member States have served \r\nas non-permanent members on the Council. We have \r\ncollectively addressed many different topics over \r\nthat period with those many partners, each of whom \r\ncontributed to the important work of the Council. Their \r\ncontributions demonstrate that we need a Security \r\nCouncil that better represents twenty-first-century \r\nrealities and is maximally capable of carrying out its \r\nmandate and effectively meeting the global challenges \r\nof this century.\r\nThe United States is open to modest expansion of \r\nthe Council in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories. Any consideration of which countries merit \r\nfuture permanent membership should take into account \r\ntheir ability and willingness to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and \r\nto other purposes of the United Nations, and to exercise \r\nthe heavy responsibility that comes with Security \r\nCouncil membership.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan to chair the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nAmong other thematic issues, significant progress \r\nhas been made in advancing the agenda of the protection \r\nof civilians in armed conflict. The Republic of Korea, as \r\nPresident of the Council in February, convened a high-\r\nlevel open debate on the issue (see S/PV.6917), in which \r\nthe Council rightly reaffirmed that protecting civilians \r\nis one of its fundamental responsibilities. The issuing \r\nof a related presidential statement (S/PRST/2013/2) \r\nunderlined the Council’s commitment to countering \r\nimpunity and ensuring peacekeeping missions’ \r\neffective implementation of protection mandates. The \r\ncontinuing high level of casualties in many conflict \r\nsituations demonstrates clearly that the protection of \r\ncivilians, particularly women and children, should \r\nremain a priority in the work of the Council.\r\nImproving the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods is an important element in bolstering the \r\neffectiveness and legitimacy of its work. During the \r\nreporting period, the Council has undertaken efforts \r\nto enhance transparency and efficiency as well as to \r\nstrengthen interaction with the wider United Nations \r\nmembership. Encouraging developments include \r\nthe holding of wrap-up sessions and briefings by the \r\npresidencies, the use of formats such as informal \r\ninteractive dialogues, and the convening of meetings \r\nwith troop- and police-contributing countries on a more \r\nregular basis. We are pleased to note that the Security \r\nCouncil Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions has advanced transparency in \r\nthe Council’s work through the adoption of presidential \r\nnotes S/2013/515 and S/2013/630.\r\nThe Republic of Korea believes that in pursuing \r\nreform of the Council, all of us should also strive to \r\nstrengthen its democratic underpinnings so as to \r\nenhance its accountability to the general membership. \r\nIn that connection, we are of the view that the only \r\nplausible way to bring about a more representative, \r\ndemocratic and effective Security Council is through \r\nthe holding of periodic elections.\r\nWe thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor his letter dated 22 October, which conveys his \r\nintention to continue intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform during the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We remain convinced \r\nthat Security Council reform should be firmly based \r\non a membership-driven and comprehensive approach, \r\nas stipulated in Assembly decision 62/557. In line with \r\nthat, the intergovernmental negotiations are the only \r\nforum for reaching an agreement on the issue, which \r\n13-55224 23/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nmissions. Pakistan takes pride in its role as a troop-\r\ncontributing country. Resolution 2086 (2013) on a \r\nmultidimensional approach to peacekeeping, adopted \r\nduring Pakistan’s presidency in January, gives a \r\nblueprint for handling complex crises, inducting \r\npost-conflict peacebuilding into the conceptual and \r\nearly planning stages of peacekeeping missions, and \r\npreventing the relapse of conflicts.\r\nIn terms of the conduct of its business, the Council \r\nis efficient and effective. The agenda is for the most part \r\npredictable. Very little time is devoted to procedural \r\ndebates or wrangling. Members go straight to the heart \r\nof the substance. Even the configuration of the agenda \r\nis well known. Roughly two thirds of the agenda relates \r\nto Africa. The working environment is collegial. Of \r\ncourse, differences exist on a wide range of issues that \r\nare resolved through negotiations. We have proposed \r\nthat communication between the permanent five, the \r\nnon-permanent members and the general membership \r\nduring serious crises be improved by using the office \r\nof the President of the Security Council.\r\nOn issues not related to the Middle East, the \r\nCouncil’s delivery and results range from good to \r\noutstanding, depending on various situations. The \r\nSecurity Council has succeeded in Somalia, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire and Liberia. It has attained impressive progress \r\nin Mali despite daunting challenges. The Council has \r\nshown resilience in chronic conflict situations in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \r\nRepublic, the Sudan and South Sudan, which require \r\nstrategic thinking and the support of regional partners \r\nfor achieving durable peace. Yemen is moving towards \r\nstability and democratic governance and Timor-Leste is \r\nundergoing a successful transition. In the years to come, \r\nwe would welcome close United Nations involvement \r\nin Afghanistan as it negotiates delicate and momentous \r\npolitical, security and economic transitions.\r\nNew paradigms and concepts have emerged from \r\nCouncil’s resolutions in the realm of peacekeeping. \r\nThese are, first, a region-wide approach, such as in \r\nthe Sahel and the Great Lakes region; secondly, robust \r\npeacekeeping manifested by the induction of the Force \r\nIntervention Brigade in the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo; thirdly, deployment of unmanned aerial \r\nsystems and growing demand for them; and fourthly, \r\nthe growing cooperation of the Council with regional \r\nand subregional organizations, especially in Africa.\r\nreform, and we look forward to resuming those \r\nmeetings this month. Mr. President, we have also read \r\nattentively your letter dated 22 October, in which you \r\nnotified Member States that a new advisory group had \r\nbeen formed to produce a basis for the resumption of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. The United States \r\nlooks forward to receiving the group’s ideas.\r\nFinally, we should all approach the upcoming \r\nsessions on Security Council reform constructively. \r\nWe know that many Member States feel that the issue \r\nhas in fact been studied far too long without action. \r\nBut hopefully, by working together, we can consider a \r\nway forward that is agreeable to the broadest possible \r\nmajority of United Nations members and that can best \r\npromote the Council’s primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and \r\nother purposes of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this meeting on the two \r\nvery important subjects of how the Security Council \r\nhas been working in the past year and how its reform \r\nhas been proceeding. We thank the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, Ambassador Liu Jieyi, for introducing \r\nthe Council’s annual report (A/68/2). \r\nThe leitmotif of this discussion is the accountability \r\nthat accompanies the Security Council’s primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Accountability helps improve the \r\nCouncil’s efficiency and effectiveness. It also creates \r\nconditions for comprehensive reform of the Council’s \r\ncomposition and working methods.\r\nSmall, incremental and yet significant measures \r\nhave been taken on working methods in the form \r\nof presidential notes. The Council has focused its \r\nefforts on transparency, interaction and dialogue \r\nwith non-Council members, and on strengthening \r\ncooperation with the troop- and police- contributing \r\ncountries. The process of appointing the chairs of the \r\nCouncil’s subsidiary bodies is also being made more \r\ntransparent, balanced and inclusive. Wrap-up sessions, \r\nrevived during Pakistan’s presidency of the Council \r\nin January, have been widely applauded. Pakistan has \r\nre-energized the Security Council Working Group on \r\nPeacekeeping, which has this year taken up the important \r\nsubjects of safety and security, new technologies, robust \r\npeacekeeping, transition and drawdown.\r\nThe Council owes much of its success to United \r\nNations peacekeeping, particularly its multidimensional \r\n24/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nWe will continue to be supportive of Africa’s just cause \r\nfor a greater role in the Security Council.\r\nWe need to explore the best ways of moving forward \r\nin intergovernmental negotiations. At this stage, it is \r\nbetter to have clarity and common understanding, \r\nor the “common ground” mentioned in your letter of \r\nyesterday, Mr. President. Decision 62/557 clearly spells \r\nout the framework and mandate of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating process, and sets the following parameters.\r\nFirst, it is a membership-driven process based \r\non the positions and proposals of Member States and \r\ngroups. Secondly, the goal is to achieve a comprehensive \r\nreform comprising the five key issues: categories of \r\nmembership, veto, size and working methods, regional \r\nrepresentation, and the relationship between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly. Thirdly, \r\nit is a process to be pursued in good faith, with mutual \r\nrespect, and in an open, inclusive and transparent \r\nmanner with the objective of seeking a solution that \r\ncan garner the widest possible political acceptance of \r\nMember States.\r\nWe are now into the sixth year of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, a process that has \r\nswung between high expectations and frustrations. \r\nThe rationale for starting the negotiations was that no \r\nproposal for reform of the Security Council had been \r\nable to muster the required support in the General \r\nAssembly. All Member States and groups agreed to \r\nengage in a negotiating process to find a solution. Such \r\nan engagement would be useful only in an environment \r\nof f lexibility. Without the readiness to meet half way, \r\nprogress was bound to be difficult. In the past five \r\nyears, the Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nhas also made frequent calls for f lexibility. That, \r\nincidentally, is the crux of the President’s letter issued \r\nyesterday and his remarks made today.\r\nIn comparative terms, let us look at the negotiating \r\npositions and postures of some groups. The Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group has always been ready for \r\nnegotiations and has demonstrated f lexibility. It took \r\nthe bold initiative to unilaterally shift from its initial \r\nposition and come up with a revised proposal, the Italy-\r\nColombia document. Our compromise proposal is an \r\nattempt to aggregate and reflect the interests of large, \r\nmedium-sized and small States as well as regions. Ours \r\nis not a take-it-or-leave-it-proposal. It is subject to \r\nnegotiations.\r\nOn the Palestinian issue, the Council plays a \r\nperipheral but very significant role. The Council, \r\nthrough its debates, keeps the spotlight on the Middle \r\nEast. We sincerely hope that the negotiations between \r\nPalestine and Israel, renewed with the help of the United \r\nStates, will lead to a genuine and result-oriented peace \r\nprocess.\r\nThe Council has moved swiftly in launching a \r\nprocess for securing and destroying Syria’s chemical \r\nweapons. We hope that the newfound goodwill \r\nbetween countries with influence in the region, and \r\nthe successful collaboration on the chemical weapons \r\nissue, will pave the way for the “Geneva II” conference \r\nand enable it to engender a political solution.\r\nLet me turn to the issue of Security Council reform. \r\nPakistan fully associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group. While addressing the Assembly \r\nin September, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan \r\nsaid:\r\n“The United Nations needs reform ... that \r\nreflects the interests of all, not just the ambitions \r\nof a few ... The intended reforms must ... plan \r\nfor a dynamic future, not entrench or replicate \r\noutdated historical patterns based on privileges.” \r\n(A/68/PV.15, p. 22)\r\nWe oppose in principle the notion of new, individual \r\npermanent members because it runs counter to the \r\navowed objectives of transparency, democratization \r\nand inclusive decision-making. There should no new \r\ncentres of privilege.\r\nPakistan is a member of the Uniting for Consensus \r\ngroup, which is one of the major stakeholders in the \r\nreform process. We also subscribe to the positions of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement and the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation. We will engage constructively \r\nwith all sides to make progress on reform.\r\nWithin the confines of this approach, we have also \r\nexpressed our respect and understanding regarding the \r\nAfrican common position, the Ezulwini Consensus, \r\nwhich we see as a collective demand of the entire \r\ncontinent and a position based on consensus and \r\nlegitimacy. That is fundamentally different from the \r\nindividual pursuit of permanent membership by a \r\nfew countries from other regions, which runs the risk \r\nof exacerbating divisions and tensions. The African \r\nposition is a special case and should be treated as such. \r\n13-55224 25/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nThirdly, a similar mandate sought by the chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations was not given \r\nto him by the general membership last session, as I \r\nmentioned earlier.\r\nFourthly, such a group cannot bypass the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process and the \r\nframework provided by decision 62/557 and it must \r\nnot jeopardize the membership-driven nature of this \r\nprocess. Only the intergovernmental negotiations can \r\ntake decisions on matters and procedures that impinge \r\non negotiations.\r\nAs stated by the representative of Italy, who spoke \r\non behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group, we do \r\nnot recognize the advisory group as being entitled to \r\nperform any drafting role on behalf of other Member \r\nStates or imposing any kind of negotiating text. That \r\nwould run counter to the membership-driven nature of \r\nthe process.\r\nPrivately, Sir, you conveyed to us and reiterated \r\ntoday that you have not authorized the advisory group \r\nto draft a resolution or a document that would serve \r\nas a basis for negotiations. Your assurance on record \r\nshould quash the misperception created by the earlier \r\ncommunication. However, misinterpretations persist, \r\nas we have heard today by some who have shared their \r\nunderstanding and perception that the advisory group \r\nwill in fact produce a concise text that would form the \r\nbasis for negotiations, and a new term, a “PGA’s text”, \r\nhas been used.\r\nAt this point, it is very important to have absolute \r\nclarity about the next steps in the reform process. \r\nCourse correction is important to ensure transparency \r\nand inclusiveness and to pursue Security Council \r\nreform in full conformity with the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations framework. We remain confident that on \r\nthe President’s watch there will be no cherry-picking, \r\nno slant towards one position or another. We deeply \r\nappreciate Ambassador Zahir Tanin’s resolute efforts \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nfor the past five years. It is important that we make \r\nprogress. Now is the time to build bridges and forge \r\nconsensus. As President of the Assembly and a neutral \r\nand independent guardian of the process, you, Sir, are \r\nbest placed to play that role.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nUnited Nations was established as a result of the \r\nSecond World War. Its purpose is to prevent the scourge \r\nof war and maintain international peace and security. \r\nOn the other hand, we see the Group of Four \r\nsticking to their original position, while paradoxically \r\nasking others to be f lexible. They would rather foist \r\ntheir position upon others as a fait accompli. For them, \r\nother reform issues are peripheral. Their position \r\nseems to be anchored in power politics. They seem to \r\nbe saying that, because of their political stature and \r\neconomic prowess, they now qualify for special status \r\nat the United Nations, whereas other Member State do \r\nnot. At times one gets the impression that they scuttle \r\nnegotiations or press the Chair to produce documents \r\nthat do not reflect wider interests.\r\nI am afraid that, in this process, the majority-\r\nminority calculus will not work. We cannot precipitate \r\ndecisions by mounting political pressure before \r\nimportant anniversaries, and there are no procedural \r\nshortcuts. In all sincerity, last year the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations sought the general \r\nmembership’s approval to produce a short document \r\nto serve as a basis for negotiations. But since that \r\nwould have been contrary to the comprehensive and \r\nMember State-driven nature of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process, the Chair was not given that \r\nmandate.\r\nWe have immense respect for you, Mr. President, \r\nbecause of your high standing and professional \r\nqualities. You were unanimously elected by the entire \r\nmembership. You have our support for the entire \r\nspectrum of issues on the agenda of the General \r\nAssembly. We respect your prerogative to seek advice \r\nand to consult. We were, however, dismayed when \r\nwe received your communication of 22 October. The \r\nUniting for Consensus group responded to your letter \r\nalong the following lines.\r\nFirst, the process to establish the advisory group \r\nlacked transparency, inclusiveness and extensive \r\nconsultations, which are necessary to clarify the \r\nobjectives, terms of reference, composition and working \r\nmethods of such a group.\r\nSecondly, your letter stated that the group is \r\nadvisory in nature and does not have a negotiating role, \r\nbut you also point out that the group’s purpose is to \r\nproduce a basis for the start of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations that reflects the ideas put forward in the \r\nnegotiations so far. In other words, it will put forward a \r\nsynthesis or a shorter document — those are my words, \r\nnot the Uniting for Consensus group’s words.\r\n26/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nthe common interest of the broad membership in the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nSecondly, Security Council reform should reflect \r\ndemocratic consultation and uphold the solidarity of \r\nMember States. At present, serious differences still exist \r\non the question of Security Council reform and related \r\nmatters, which should be settled through continuous, \r\nextensive and democratic consultation. Security \r\nCouncil reform cannot be achieved at the expense of \r\nthe solidarity among Member States, nor can progress \r\nbe achieved to the detriment of the solidarity that exists \r\namong Member States. Only consensual decisions, \r\nbased on broad consultation, can gain the unanimous \r\ntrust and support of Member States and stand the test \r\nof time and history. Setting up arbitrary timelines \r\nfor pressing forward on  reform of specific aspects, \r\nwhen conditions are not mature, is not conducive to \r\nsubstantive reform. That leads to deviation from the \r\nright direction of the reform and will therefore make \r\nthe process even more difficult to carry out.\r\nThirdly, intergovernmental negotiations are a \r\nuniversally recognized platform for discussion of \r\nSecurity Council reform. Maintaining the authority \r\nand role of the intergovernmental negotiations will \r\nhelp keep the reform process on the right track. \r\nIntergovernmental negotiations must be guided by the \r\nprinciple of ownership by Members States and must be \r\nbased on their positions and ideas. Without the common \r\nunderstanding and the authorization of Member States, \r\npositions and negotiating options cannot be streamlined. \r\nChina has noted that the President of the General \r\nAssembly, in his letter to the entire membership dated \r\n22 October 2013, has established an advisory group \r\non Security Council reform. China has also taken \r\nnote of the explanations made by the President this \r\nmorning. China has exchanged views on the issue with \r\nthe President and the countries concerned. We believe \r\nthat the advisory group can advise the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly informally, but has no negotiating \r\nmandate or drafting role.\r\nSecurity Council reform can be advanced only \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations framework. \r\nChina hopes that Member States will continue the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly, in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of resolution 62/557 of 15 September \r\n2008 and in an open, inclusive and transparent manner. \r\nWe will continue to work actively with other Member \r\nIn the course of nearly 70 years since its inception, \r\nthe international situation has undergone major and \r\nprofound changes. The United Nations membership \r\nhas increased tremendously. Common threats and \r\nchallenges faced by all countries have multiplied. The \r\nexpectations of Member States for the United Nations \r\nand the Security Council increase continuously. As the \r\nmain organ of the United Nations with a mandate to \r\nmaintain international peace and security, the Security \r\nCouncil must adapt to the changing international \r\nsituation through reform so that it can better fulfil \r\nits sacred responsibility given by the United Nations \r\nCharter.\r\nThe priority in reforming the Security Council \r\nshould be to increase the representation of the \r\ndeveloping countries, in particular the countries of \r\nAfrica, and provide more opportunities for medium-\r\nsized and small-sized countries, which constitute the \r\nmajority of the United Nations membership, to enter the \r\nSecurity Council and participate in its decision-making. \r\nSince Security Council reform involves the future of \r\nthe United Nations Organization and the fundamental \r\ninterests of the entire membership, it can be achieved \r\nonly through democratic discussion and patient \r\nconsultation among Members to build upon common \r\nunderstanding and to search for a package solution \r\nbased on the broad understanding among Member \r\nStates.\r\nOn the advancement of the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, I would like to emphasize the following three \r\npoints. \r\nFirst, the reform of the Security Council must be \r\nmoved forward in the right direction. The Council is \r\nmandated with the important responsibility to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. The purpose of \r\nCouncil reform should be to safeguard its authority, \r\nincrease its efficiency, expand its representation, \r\nand strengthen its role so that it can better meet the \r\nexpectations and the trust of Member States.\r\nA highly effective, responsible, and representative \r\nSecurity Council is in the common interest of all \r\nMember States. All countries should work together \r\nin that process, taking into consideration each other’s \r\nconcerns and interests for the sake of promoting mutual \r\ntrust, an essential ingredient in a joint effort to advance \r\nSecurity Council reform. Reform should be conducive \r\nto the long-term development of the United Nations and \r\n13-55224 27/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nin both categories, permanent and non-permanent, in \r\naccordance with the African common position stated \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \r\nAny expansion of the permanent category Council \r\nmembership should include a seat for the Arab States \r\nas well, in accordance with the decision of the Arab \r\nSummit held in Sirte in 2010, and the compendium \r\ndocument prepared by the head of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.\r\nLibya believes that the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil should also include the introduction of genuine \r\nimprovements in its working methods, activities and \r\nprocedures, including, as a first stage, ensuring the \r\nrestriction on the use of the veto power in cases of crimes \r\nagainst humanity, genocide or foreign occupation, until \r\nthat right is completely abolished. Transparency and \r\nopenness should prevail in the work of the Council. \r\nNon-members should be able to contribute to its work, \r\nparticularly the countries most directly concerned with \r\nthe issues on its agenda.\r\nWe welcome your commitment, Mr. President, \r\nexpressed in the letter you addressed to Member States \r\non 22 October 2013, to support efforts to reform the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly the Security Council, and \r\nyour action to establish an advisory group to provide \r\ninputs and recommendations on the reform process. \r\nHowever, we would like to reiterate that the role of that \r\nadvisory group should not be parallel or equal to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to stress decision \r\n62/557 as the cornerstone for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council and \r\nthe expansion of its membership. That decision has \r\nreasserted Member States’ ownership of that process, \r\nand we are committed to continuing the negotiations, \r\nprovided that the positions and proposals of all groups \r\nand individual delegations are taken into account.\r\nThe reports submitted by the Council to the General \r\nAssembly do not reflect the Council’s commitment \r\nto what has been stipulated in Assembly resolutions \r\nregarding the report, in particular with respect to \r\nreducing the narrative part and including analytical \r\nreports on the issues upon which the Council had taken \r\ndecisions, the positions of the various member States \r\nand the reasons that led the Council not to take firm \r\npositions on important issues related to international \r\npeace and security. We hope that future reports of \r\nthe Security Council will be more useful and include \r\nStates to find a formula that enjoys broad consensus and \r\nthat is in the long-term interest of the United Nations \r\nand the common interest of Member States.\r\nMr. Dabbashi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation would like to welcome the reappointment \r\nof Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, as facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council. We \r\nreiterate our support for his efforts and look forward to \r\nworking with him. My delegation also aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of Sierra \r\nLeone on behalf of the African Group and of Egypt on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nFor the past several years, we have been working \r\nto reform the Security Council, improve its working \r\nmethods and expand its membership in order to \r\nenable it to respond to the existing challenges in the \r\ninternational arena and to fulfil its basic mandate in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nMember States have made great efforts during previous \r\nsessions of the General Assembly to expedite the reform \r\nprocess. However, we have so far not achieved any \r\ntangible progress. The latest events in some regions of \r\nthe world have demonstrated the importance of a quick \r\nresponse and movement and the need for the Council to \r\ntake adequate measures for the maintenance of peace \r\nand security and for protecting thousands of people \r\nwho face genuine threats to their lives.\r\nThe delegation of Libya is determined to support \r\nefforts to reform the Security Council and is committed \r\nto cooperating constructively with all parties concerned. \r\nWe will support all efforts to achieve genuine reform \r\nof the Council that would make it more just, in terms \r\nof taking into account the opinions and interests of \r\nall groups. Such broader representation would make \r\nthe Council more reflective of contemporary realities, \r\nquicker to respond to threats to the security and \r\nstability of peoples, and more capable of effectively \r\nperforming its mandate in accordance with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nLibya therefore stresses the importance of \r\ncorrecting the historical injustice done to the African \r\ncontinent, which has not been represented in the \r\npermanent category of membership in the Council, \r\nin contrast to all other continents. It also stresses the \r\nimportance of working to recognize Africa’s historical \r\nright, end its marginalization and give it the opportunity \r\nto be equitably represented in the Security Council, \r\n28/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nNations, able to make a significant contribution to the \r\nwork of the Council. It is in that context that France \r\nsupports an expansion in both categories of membership \r\nand supports in particular the candidacy of Germany, \r\nBrazil, India and Japan as permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council and an increased presence of African \r\ncountries, including among the permanent members.\r\nSimilarly, France supports efforts to improve the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council, insofar \r\nas that involves increasing its transparency and \r\nefficiency. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ninform the Assembly of France’s initiative on the \r\nvoluntary limitation of the exercise of the veto, which \r\nhas been promoted at the highest level by our President, \r\nMr. François Hollande. Our Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Mr. Laurent Fabius, has also spoken on the \r\nsubject.\r\nThe limitation of the exercise of the veto would \r\ninvolve the five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil voluntarily and collectively suspending their \r\nright to exercise the veto when mass atrocities are under \r\nconsideration. It would thus be a voluntary process — a \r\ncode of conduct — which would therefore not require a \r\nrevision of the Charter. It would not in fact be a reform \r\nof the Security Council.\r\nThe criteria for that self-limitation remain to be \r\ndefined by the permanent members of the Council \r\nthemselves, who need to consider and agree on practical \r\narrangements for the adoption of such a code of conduct. \r\nThey must, for example, agree on a definition of mass \r\natrocities. The outcome document of the 2005 World \r\nSummit (resolution 60/1) and a number of international \r\nconventions, including the 1948 Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \r\nand the Rome Statute, can guide us in that respect.\r\nThey will also need to define the warning \r\nmechanism or mechanisms that could trigger such \r\nself-limitation. France is considering, for example, the \r\npossibility of the Secretary-General playing a central \r\nrole in that regard, in the spirit of Article 99 of the \r\nCharter. France has also proposed that 50 Member States \r\ncould call upon the Security Council to meet when mass \r\natrocities occur. Those proposals could allow us to start \r\ndiscussions on the subject, in particular with academia. \r\nTo that end, France is planning to involve all the actors \r\ninvolved in the discussion, including research institutes \r\nand non-governmental organizations working on the \r\nthe reasons that have prevented the Council from \r\nimplementing its mandate to preserve international \r\npeace and security. We also hope that the General \r\nAssembly, at the appropriate time, will be able to fill in \r\nthe gaps that have been left by the Council owing to the \r\napplication of double standards and the use of the veto \r\npower or the threat of use of that power, as has been the \r\ncase over the past few years.\r\nMr. Lamek (France) (spoke in French):  Allow \r\nme to start by welcoming Ambassador Tanin’s \r\nreappointment as facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We thank him \r\nfor all his efforts to make his working paper on reform \r\nmore concise and pragmatic. In that spirit, we welcome \r\nthe establishment of an advisory board that will support \r\nyour efforts, Mr. President, and those of the facilitator.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform began in 2009. They followed on the \r\nheels of earlier discussions and initiatives on the same \r\nsubject. Indeed, the process has been ongoing for \r\n20 years now. It is clear that we have failed to move \r\nforward on that issue. Certainly, the debates on the \r\nsubject are now a little more interactive, and many \r\ninitiatives have provided fuel for the debate. However, \r\nnone of them have been able to achieve concrete results.\r\nFrance hopes that the new round of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will provide an opportunity for Member \r\nStates to finally agree on an ambitious reform \r\nprogramme. In that regard, we hope that the advisory \r\nboard that you have established, Sir, will be able \r\nto present a text that, while drawing on the various \r\ninitiatives presented by Member States, will present \r\na pragmatic and realistic synthesis. France hopes that \r\nhaving a text for further negotiations will enable us \r\nto take real steps towards a substantial reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMember States have the serious responsibility of \r\nsupporting an ambitious reform of the Council so that \r\nit can better and more accurately reflects the realities \r\nof today’s world, while strengthening the Council’s \r\nability to fully assume its responsibilities in terms of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nAs members know, France’s requirements for \r\nreform have not changed. The reform of the Council \r\nmust take into account the emergence of new Powers \r\nthat are willing and able to assume the responsibilities \r\nof a permanent presence on the Security Council and \r\nthat are, in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\n13-55224 29/30\r\n07/11/2013 A/68/PV.46\r\nmake a few remarks on how we see that the current \r\nstandstill could finally be overcome.\r\nYour initiative, Mr. President, comes at the right \r\ntime. We strongly welcome your decision to establish \r\nan advisory group of eminent Ambassadors to provide \r\nan input that reflects relevant opinions on the issue and \r\nindicates the options, which could serve as a basis for \r\nthe resumed intergovernmental negotiations process. \r\nWe appreciate your explanation of the purpose of the \r\ngroup, which shows that the criticisms that we have \r\nheard regarding your initiative are indeed unfounded. \r\nI would also like to congratulate our colleagues on \r\ntheir appointment to the group and look forward to the \r\nresults of their work.\r\nThe work of the advisory group could provide \r\nmuch needed momentum. In our view, which is shared \r\nby many here in this Hall, the most useful product of \r\nyour initiative, Mr. President, would be an operational \r\ntext that would enable Chairman Tanin to resume the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process on that basis. \r\nLet us be honest. Despite the most laudable efforts of \r\nChairman Tanin, the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess has thus far been a negotiations process only in \r\nname, not in substance.\r\nOf course differences exist among Member States \r\non the content of the reform. But, frankly, that is no \r\nexcuse for not being able to agree on one simple aspect, \r\nnamely, to finally start true and genuine text-based \r\nnegotiations, as we are used to doing on a daily basis in \r\nthe General Assembly and its Main Committees.\r\nWe hear calls for compromise and f lexibility. \r\nHowever, at the same time, no such f lexibility or \r\nwillingness to compromise is forthcoming from those \r\nwho call for that f lexibility when it comes to allowing \r\nnegotiations to start. That runs counter to the normal \r\nprocesses of the Organization and the basic logic of \r\nmultilateral diplomacy.\r\nWe have said repeatedly that we stand ready to \r\nactively contribute to genuine negotiations in a spirit of \r\nf lexibility. Let us start a negotiations process whereby \r\nwe can identify the common ground and see if and how \r\nthe positions of Member States evolve. Let us finally \r\nengage in real give-and-take negotiations on this \r\nimportant issue.\r\nTo summarize, there has been enough talk. Let us \r\nsee some action. Germany stands ready to contribute.\r\nissue, who could share their thoughts with us in a very \r\nuseful way.\r\nMr. Wittig (Germany): Let me at the outset thank \r\nthe delegations of China for introducing the report of \r\nthe Security Council (A/68/2) and of the United States \r\nof America for preparing it. Allow me to also express \r\nmy appreciation for your convening, Sir, today’s debate \r\non the topic.\r\nThe annual report of the Security Council discussed \r\ntoday covers a period during which my country was \r\na member of the Council. Looking back, one issue \r\ncertainly stands out in my memory — namely, the long \r\ndeadlock in the Council caused by three double vetoes \r\nand the terrible impact that had for the Syrian people. \r\nWhile the Council has found a common voice again, it \r\nis too little, too late for the more than 100,000 dead, the \r\nwounded, the starving and the displaced.\r\nBut even beyond Syria, that episode raises a \r\nlarger question. Is the Security Council, as we see it \r\ntoday, still able to effectively address current and \r\nfuture challenges? Members know our view that it is \r\nnot. In that context, I would like to associate myself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier by my colleague, \r\nAmbassador Yoshikawa, on behalf of the Group of \r\nFour countries. Let me add the following points in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nAfter many years of discussions on Council \r\nreform — first in the Open-ended Working Group \r\non the Question of Equitable Representation on and \r\nIncrease in the Membership of the Security Council \r\nand Other Matters Related to the Security Council, and \r\nnow in the intergovernmental negotiations — we have \r\nreached a point where the positions of Member States \r\nare well known to all, where everything has been said, \r\nand much has been tried in order to move forward. But \r\ndespite all of the stated commitment to reform, we are \r\nbeing held at a standstill. Understandably, frustration is \r\ngrowing among Member States.\r\nWe welcome new initiatives, such as the \r\nestablishment of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency Group and the French proposal on veto \r\nlimitations. But important as these initiatives are, they \r\ndo not go to the root of the problem. Germany remains \r\nconvinced that only a real structural reform of the \r\nCouncil will make it more effective and representative \r\nof the world we live in today. I will not go into the \r\ndetails of Germany’s position. It is well known and has \r\nbeen placed on record numerous times. Let me rather \r\n30/30 13-55224\r\nA/68/PV.46 07/11/2013\r\nwhere Member States stand on the issue. Are they part \r\nof the broad majority that wants progress or part of the \r\nblocking minority that is eager to maintain the status \r\nquo?\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\nI wish, Mr. President, to thank you once again for \r\nyour important initiative and for giving the issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform the attention that it deserves. \r\nIf anything, today’s debate will make clear to everyone \r\n"
