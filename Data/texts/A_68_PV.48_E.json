"In the absence of the President, Mrs. Miculescu \r\n(Romania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 29 and 123 (continued)\r\nReport of the Security Council\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/68/2)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters\r\nMr. Nkoloi (Botswana): Let me, at the outset, \r\nthank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this very important debate. I also wish to \r\nthank the Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador Tanin, for continuing to consult us and \r\nengage with as we search for a solution to this long-\r\npending question.\r\nIt has now been over five years since the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted decision 62/557, on \r\n15 September 2008, which was aimed at launching the \r\nintergovernmental process. We are concerned about the \r\nslow pace of negotiations.\r\nMy delegation wishes to stress the great importance \r\nwe attach to the question of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. We believe that this is an imperative whose \r\ntime has come. We therefore welcome the resumption \r\nof the negotiations and urge the Chair of the process, \r\nAmbassador Tanin, to garner all the necessary strength \r\nand resilience to drive the process to its logical \r\nconclusion. My delegation pledges its utmost support \r\nand commits to engaging in constructive and open \r\ndialogue.\r\nThe Security Council remains the most important \r\norgan of the United Nations, whose primary mandate \r\nis the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. However, it is regrettable that ever since \r\nits establishment, in 1945, the Council has lacked, \r\nand still lacks, adequate geographic and democratic \r\nrepresentation of the United Nations membership.\r\nIt defies human logic that Africa still remains the \r\nonly unrepresented constituency in such a body, the \r\nlegitimacy and strength of which must derive from \r\nthe totality of its membership. While all regions of \r\nthe world are represented and have a footprint in the \r\nCouncil, Africa is still relegated to the back bench, \r\nwith no voice, no power and no presence to influence \r\nthe key decisions of that powerful institution.\r\nMy delegation believes that it is now time to \r\nreform the character, shape and working methods of \r\nthe Council in order to bring them in line with the \r\nrealities of contemporary international relations. It \r\nis for that reason that we remain committed to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations aimed at addressing the \r\nhistorical imbalances of the Council and bringing about \r\nimprovements in its decision-making and working \r\nmethods.\r\nIn line with both Africa’s position and that of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), my delegation \r\nholds the view that the reform of the Council should \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.48\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n48th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 8 November 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

I thank \r\nyou, Madam President, for allowing me to present the \r\nposition of my country on the subject matter.\r\nWith regard to the report of the Security Council to \r\nthe General Assembly (A/68/2), I thank my colleague \r\nand current President of the Security Council, \r\nAmbassador Liu Jieyi, for his introduction of the report \r\n(see A/68/PV.46), and the United States delegation for \r\nits hard work in preparing it. The report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the Assembly is a good mechanism for \r\nthe transparency and accountability of the Council. \r\nRwanda will continue to support any and all initiatives \r\naimed at opening up the Council to the participation of \r\nthe general United Nations membership, especially the \r\nparticipation of those directly concerned by Security \r\nCouncil decisions.\r\nOn the general discussion on Security Council \r\nreform, allow me to first commend the President of the \r\nAssembly for his leadership and demonstrated effort \r\nto move forward on this debate aimed at reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, as demonstrated by his decision to set \r\nup an advisory group to provide input to help kick-start \r\nthe process of text-based negotiations. That initiative \r\nis a clear demonstration of his strong commitment \r\nto make substantive progress in the process. The \r\nSecurity Council reform process is aimed at better \r\nreflecting contemporary realities and achieving a more \r\naccountable, representative and transparent Council, \r\nmindful of all regional groups and emerging Powers, \r\nas well as small island, landlocked and developing \r\ncountries.\r\nWe also welcome his decision to reappoint His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. That move not only \r\nanswers the plea of several Member States that advocated \r\nfor his reappointment during the informal meeting of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform held in June, but will also ensure consistency \r\nwith previous deliberations while allowing this debate \r\nto make headway.\r\nRwanda aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby His Excellency Mr. Vandi Chidi Minah, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Sierra Leone to the United Nations, \r\non behalf of the African Group (see A/68/PV.46). I \r\nbe comprehensive, transparent and inclusive. While \r\nstressing the importance and primacy of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, we reiterate our long-held position \r\nthat the envisaged reform of the Council should result \r\nin a more effective and efficient body. In that context, \r\nit is our hope and expectation that the reform process \r\nwill embrace the following elements: the categories \r\nof membership, regional representation, the size of an \r\nenlarged Council, the working methods, and, of course, \r\nthe veto question.\r\nWhile welcoming the resumption of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we wish to caution \r\nMember States that it is very important to remain \r\nopen-minded and f lexible in our debate. There is no \r\nwisdom in sticking to known positions. Negotiations \r\nare by nature a give-and-take process. We need to \r\ncompromise.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of NAM \r\n(see A/68/PV.46) and would like to reiterate Africa’s \r\nposition, as contained in the Ezulwini Consensus.\r\nThe African position is loud and clear. It is inspired \r\nby the desire to see the continent take its rightful place \r\namong the community of nations in making key global \r\ndecisions. That position proposes the expansion of the \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories. Furthermore, the African position views the \r\nquestion of the veto as divisive, exclusive and subject \r\nto abuse by the veto-wielding Powers. Africa therefore \r\nwishes to see a review of the veto power with a view \r\nto abolishing it. If it is not abolished, then a reformed \r\nCouncil, which must include Africa, must extend the \r\nveto power to the new permanent members without \r\nexception.\r\nWe therefore have every confidence that, as \r\nwe resume these negotiations, we shall take into \r\nconsideration all the proposals brought forward by \r\nvarious groups, find areas of convergence and build on \r\nthe consensus on them. After all, we are all here not \r\nto dismember or render ineffective our most cherished \r\nbody. We are here to enrich it, find common ground and \r\naddress the limitations that are already apparent in the \r\nCouncil, with a view to strengthening it. We trust that \r\na solution will be found to propel the Council to greater \r\nheights as we continue to serve humankind for future \r\ngenerations.\r\nMr. Gasana (Rwanda): At the outset, let me thank \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for convening \r\n13-55456 3/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nonce again call upon permanent members to refrain \r\nfrom using the veto, especially in the case of genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity.\r\nImproving the Council’s working methods also \r\nentails in particular improving the Council’s resolve \r\nto fight against impunity, especially for those who \r\nhave committed genocide and other crimes against \r\nhumanity. It is therefore unfortunate to note that the \r\nperpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda, which have \r\nbeen renamed the Forces démocratiques de libération \r\ndu Rwanda, are still roaming free in the eastern part \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That fact is \r\neven more deplorable since we know that the United \r\nNations Organization Stabilization Mission in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, a United Nations \r\nforce of nearly 20,000 troops with a budget of more \r\nthan $1 billion a year, has done nothing for the past \r\n13 years to combat them — not to mention the fact that \r\nthe Security Council has never held the United Nations \r\nMission that it established accountable.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform have been going on for too long. Some \r\neven wonder if reform will be achieved in our lifetime. \r\nHowever, I would appeal to all of us to show a sense \r\nof responsibility and ensure that we have a concrete \r\noutcome by the year 2015, which will be a double \r\nanniversary: the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World \r\nSummit, at which our Heads of State and Government \r\nmandated us to achieve early reforms of the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nTo conclude, Rwanda is confident that, under \r\nthe leadership of the President of the Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council reform process will soon move from \r\ndebating procedural questions to engaging in text-based \r\nnegotiations. We will continue to render our support to \r\nhis effort in search of a common position that brings \r\nabout a fair and equitable resolution of the pressing \r\nissues surrounding this debate. It is our firm hope that \r\nduring his tenure as President of the General Assembly, \r\ngiven his dedication to reforming the process, that \r\nnoble landmark will be credited to him — and all \r\nmembers — as their legacy to posterity.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): I would first like to thank \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for convening \r\nthis important debate ahead of the new cycle of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. I also commend his decision to reappoint \r\nAmbassador Tanin of Afghanistan as the Chair of the \r\ncommend his efforts as coordinator of the African \r\nUnion Committee of Ten Heads of State to promote \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus and for tirelessly engaging \r\nall Member States and interest groups to achieve the \r\nAfrican common position.\r\nRwanda, as a member of the L.69 group, further \r\naligns itself with the statement, also delivered at the \r\n46th meeting, by His Excellency Mr. Delano Frank \r\nBart, Permanent Representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nto the United Nations, on behalf of the L.69 group, a \r\ndiverse group of developing countries united to achieve \r\na lasting and comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nWe are encouraged by the rapprochement of \r\nthe African Group and the L.69 group on Security \r\nCouncil reform, which I believe will help us achieve \r\na comprehensive reform, which shall include the \r\nexpansion of the Security Council membership in both \r\ncategories — permanent and non-permanent — with \r\nthe same rights and obligations as the current members, \r\nparticularly with regard to the veto right, as long as it \r\nexists.\r\nIt has been demonstrated that the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the United Nations wishes for a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. The \r\nreform shall uphold the principles of fairness and \r\nequitable geographical representation, particularly \r\nin favour of Africa, a continent that has yet to be \r\nrepresented in the permanent category of the Security \r\nCouncil although it provides more than a quarter of the \r\nUnited Nations membership and occupies more than \r\n70 per cent of its agenda.\r\nRwanda also strongly supports the improvement \r\nof the working methods of the Security Council, \r\nand we commend the work done by Ambassador \r\nMaría Cristina Perceval of Argentina as Chair of the \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions. We also support the dedication \r\nof the accountability, coherence and transparency \r\ngroup for the improvement of the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council, which was defended with courage \r\nand resolve by the group of five small nations.\r\nIn that regard, we reiterate our firm belief that \r\nthe responsibility to protect the citizens of the world \r\nshall not be held hostage by the political interests of \r\nthe permanent members of the Security Council — that \r\nhas cost us millions of lives, particularly in the 1994 \r\ngenocide perpetrated against the Tutsi in Rwanda. We \r\n4/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1) and \r\nits aftermath into concrete results.\r\nAfter so many years of debate and after so many \r\nmeetings and speeches, it is challenging to come \r\nup with something entirely new. Although we have \r\naccumulated a lot of different proposals, political \r\nwill and unity are now of the utmost importance. \r\nNevertheless, we must strive to be innovative. What \r\nwe need is to identify common denominators, stronger \r\ninvolvement and interaction between and among major \r\ngroups in the process.\r\nA number of achievements in the wider United \r\nNations reform have already been made since the World \r\nSummit. That reform has already given birth, inter \r\nalia, to the Human Rights Council, the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, UN-Women and, most recently, to the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. \r\nThe obvious shortfall in that regard, however, remains \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nIn 2015, the United Nations will celebrate its \r\nseventieth anniversary. It took only 18 years after the \r\nfoundation of the United Nations to adopt the General \r\nAssembly resolution on the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil (resolution 1991 A (XVIII)). In 2015 we shall \r\nmark the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of the \r\nwork of the 15-member Council. To say that reform is \r\noverdue would be more than stating the obvious. Having \r\nsaid all that, let me reiterate Croatia’s full support to the \r\nforthcoming intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nand to express our confidence that it will bring us \r\ncloser to our common goal of a reformed and improved \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Alcántara Mejía (Dominican Republic) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Allow me to express my appreciation to the \r\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative of China \r\nand President of the Security Council during the month \r\nof November for his comprehensive introduction of \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/68/2). \r\nPursuant to Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, the Security Council has a mandate \r\nto submit reports to the General Assembly for the \r\nconsideration of States Members of the United Nations. \r\nThe document that we have before us covers a rather \r\ndifficult period that undoubtedly tested the capacity of \r\nthe Security Council to maintain international peace \r\nand security.\r\nDespite the efforts made by Council members, the \r\nreport continues to suffer from a lack of an analytic \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. I would like to thank \r\nthe President and Ambassador Tanin for their leadership \r\nin the process.\r\nIn Croatia’s view, the present structure and \r\nfunctioning of the Council does not properly reflect \r\neither the geopolitical realities of today’s world or \r\nthe structure of United Nations membership in the \r\ntwenty-first century. Therefore, in order to maintain \r\nthe Council’s authority, relevance and indispensability \r\nin maintaining global peace and security, its reform \r\nmust not be postponed any further, and it must be \r\ncomprehensive.\r\nCroatia served on the Security Council in 2008 \r\nand 2009, and that valuable opportunity has given us \r\ndeeper insight into both the Council’s strengths and \r\nits shortcomings. Therefore, we are of the view that \r\nthe enlargement of the Council is deeply connected \r\nwith the reform of its working methods. It is Croatia’s \r\nposition that any expansion of that crucial organ should \r\nhappen in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership, with one additional seat to \r\nbe reserved for the Group of Eastern European States \r\nin the non-permanent category. Such a reform would \r\nthen properly reflect the reality of contemporary \r\ninternational relations and ensure appropriate and \r\nbalanced representation for various parts of the world \r\nin the Council.\r\nFurthermore, although we welcome the greater \r\ntransparency in the Council’s work achieved thus far, \r\nwe find that there is still room for improvement in that \r\nregard. We believe that the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates deserves equal treatment with the four other \r\nregional groups. I will not use the composition of the \r\nPresident’s advisory group as an example of that, but \r\nI must emphasize that the Eastern European Group is \r\nentitled to equal treatment, recognition and respect. An \r\nadditional seat for the Eastern European Group in an \r\nenlarged Security Council is very important, but not \r\nthe only step along that road.\r\nIn Croatia’s view, one of the key issues in the \r\nreform of the Security Council includes questions being \r\nraised on the use of the veto power. Its should be used \r\nresponsibly and, above all, in a limited manner. By that \r\nwe mean limiting its use in cases of genocide and gross \r\nhuman rights violations.\r\nFurthermore, Croatia strongly supports \r\nintensifying efforts to translate the decisions set out in \r\n13-55456 5/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nwill and commitment of the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to correct that unjust situation with firm \r\ndetermination. It is time to put an end to the imbalance \r\nthat has relegated some regions to the sidelines when \r\nit comes to Council representation. Only then, we \r\nbelieve, will the Council be better able to respond, and \r\nwith greater efficacy, to the growing problems and \r\nchallenges that arise in international relations.\r\nI take this opportunity to commend the new \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council on their recent \r\nelections. We hope that they will contribute positively \r\nto the work of the Council in maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Hamilton (Malta): My delegation expresses \r\nits appreciation for the President’s resolve to make \r\nthe reform of the Security Council a priority for his \r\nmandate. I also join other delegations in thanking the \r\nPermanent Representative of China for introducing the \r\nSecurity Council’s annual report (A/68/2) on behalf of \r\nthe Council.\r\nMalta fully associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Italy on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus (UFC) group (see A/68/PV.46).\r\nWith deference to the recent decision to create an \r\nadvisory group to the President of the General Assembly \r\non the Security Council reform process, UFC members \r\nhave already conveyed their assessments in the letter \r\ndated 31 October. We thank the President for his \r\nmeeting on Wednesday meeting with UFC members. \r\nHis clarifications were encouraging, especially when \r\nhe informed us that the advisory group would have only \r\na consultative purpose and would not have a negotiating \r\nrole or a mandate to draft or to streamline any \r\nnegotiating document or draft resolution and that the \r\nadvisory group would not bypass the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We appreciate the fact that, in his opening \r\nremarks yesterday, the President restated those points \r\nvery clearly. We hope that augurs well for an end to any \r\nmisinterpretations of the advisory group’s mandate.\r\nConsidering the slow rate of progress during the \r\nsixty-seventh session of the General Assembly, it is \r\nappropriate that we look forward to identifying common \r\nground, as the President stated in his letter dated \r\n6 November. In our collective thoughts and actions we \r\nneed to define the areas of convergence according to the \r\nprinciples agreed to by consensus in decision 62/557, \r\nof 15 September 2008. Malta remains of the firm view \r\nthat the five key agreed issues are interlinked. If we \r\nperspective of the work undertaken by that organ, its \r\npublic open meetings and its informal consultations. \r\nWe recognize, however, the progress made by Council \r\nmembers to optimize transparency in their work. \r\nWe also acknowledge the improvement in working \r\nmethods, which help Member States to participate more \r\nactively on questions and concerns of common interest \r\non the Council’s agenda.\r\nAddressing the matter of its working methods leads \r\nus to refer to a point of particular importance for the \r\nDominican Republic, that is, the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We commend the interest of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly in keeping the topic among those \r\nof highest priority in his programme of action.\r\nThe Dominican Republic hopes that the process \r\nwill continue to move forward in an open, inclusive and \r\ntransparent manner, with the goal of Member States \r\nbeing able to decisively impact the democratization \r\nof the Security Council. We support the idea of 2015 \r\nserving as a horizon for setting the necessary guidelines \r\nfor the long-awaited reform of the Council. We \r\ntherefore hope that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform will continue and that a \r\ndocument can be consolidated to support negotiations \r\naimed at bringing greater legitimacy and credibility to \r\nthe Council’s work.\r\nWe welcome the reappointment of Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, \r\nat the helm of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nas well as the selection of the group of ambassador \r\nadvisers on Security Council reform. We trust in the \r\nleadership and skill of the members of that group to \r\nreach important decisions at this crucial stage.\r\nThe Dominican Republic has always advocated \r\nfor an enlargement of the Council to take place with \r\nparticular emphasis on opening up greater opportunities \r\nfor developing countries, thereby ensuring a more level \r\nplaying field. Hence we support the communiqué issued \r\nin February at the conclusion of the twenty-fourth \r\nInter-sessional Meeting of the Conference of  the Heads \r\nof State and of Government of the Caribbean Community, \r\nin which there was a call for greater urgency to achieve \r\nlasting reform of the Security Council. We also support \r\nthe initiative it contains to give new momentum to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nThe current structure of Council membership is \r\nclearly unbalanced and does not accurately reflect the \r\ncurrent geopolitical situation. We appeal to the political \r\n6/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nin our discussions. Malta notes that only the Uniting for \r\nConsensus proposal includes specific non-permanent \r\nseats for both small and medium-sized States. It is \r\nalso statistically the most advantageous proposal for \r\nover 180 Member States, including all small and all \r\nmedium-sized States. That fact has not only been stated \r\nby the Uniting for Consensus group, but has also been \r\npublished by the independent civil society organization \r\nPlatform for Change, which aims to educate and inform \r\nthe diplomatic community and civil society about the \r\nimportant issues and events surrounding Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the role that the President \r\nand his predecessors have played in trying to bring the \r\nviews of different delegations closer together and, in so \r\ndoing, to define and agree on an approach that would do \r\njustice to all the States Members of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Rakhmetullin (Kazakhstan): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation wishes to thank the President for \r\nconvening this important and most timely meeting. \r\nWe also congratulate His Excellency Mr. Zahir \r\nTanin, Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, on \r\nhis reappointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform and for his \r\nleadership in guiding its complex deliberations.\r\nKazakhstan recognizes that the geographical \r\nimbalance in the Security Council and the limitations \r\nin its operations continue to exist. Kazakhstan \r\ntherefore reiterates its commitment to reform of the \r\nUnited Nations — primarily the Council — on both \r\nof those fronts. With a view to the enhancement of \r\nregional representation, my delegation reconfirms its \r\nposition on increasing the Council’s membership from \r\nthe existing number of 15 to 25 by establishing six \r\npermanent and four non-permanent Security Council \r\nmember seats. Moving the negotiations forward \r\ndemands a new understanding that would bridge \r\nthe divergence among the vast majority of Member \r\nStates. The positions of all the groups concerned need \r\nto be bridged. Kazakhstan therefore calls for a spirit \r\nof compromise and inclusiveness in order to gain the \r\nbroadest possible consensus. We would like to submit \r\nthe following recommendations for the General \r\nAssembly’s consideration.\r\nThe proposals of the latest intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations should be carefully reviewed with respect, \r\nin particular, to the veto right with all its implications, \r\nso that a viable solution can be found. We believe that \r\na change in the working methods does not require an \r\nmaintain those five key issues as one component, we \r\nwill ensure that the reform of the Security Council is \r\nconducted in a coherent and cohesive manner. In turn, \r\nthat would safeguard the interests of all Member States \r\nand endow a reformed Security Council with the much-\r\nneeded sense of ownership of the broader membership.\r\nAs the President rightly stated in his letter, that \r\ncommon ground can be reached only through a process \r\nof negotiations, of give and take. Malta understands \r\nthat only the Uniting for Consensus group has shown \r\nflexibility to date, having come forward in 2009 with \r\na constructive, updated proposal that is, comparatively \r\nspeaking, the most beneficial for the wider United \r\nNations membership. We call on other groups to \r\nreciprocate in this exercise of give and take.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations over the past \r\nfew years have clearly shown that there is at least \r\nagreement on two issues among all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, and those could provide a common \r\nground for advancing our consideration of the question \r\nof Security Council reform. The two issues are, first, \r\nthat there should be an increase in the non-permanent \r\nmember category and, secondly, that the historical \r\ninjustice regarding Africa’s representation should be \r\nremedied.\r\nAll States Members agree on the need to reform \r\nthe Security Council in order for it to better reflect \r\nthe world in the twenty-first century. Member States, \r\nespecially small and medium-sized States, continue to \r\nsearch for ways to reform the Security Council so as \r\nto make it more representative, more democratic, more \r\nefficient and effective, more accountable and more \r\ntransparent in order to better address the challenges of \r\nour time as we approach the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe membership of the Security Council has to \r\nbe more reflective of present-day realities. Therefore, \r\nlike many other States, Malta strongly believes that the \r\nCouncil membership should be increased. I would like to \r\nrecall that, since the last Security Council enlargement, \r\nin 1965, 76 countries have joined the Organization as \r\nnew States Members. It is therefore logical that one of \r\nthe key issues that needs to be resolved is the question of \r\nthe enlargement of a reformed Security Council to take \r\ninto account the larger General Assembly membership \r\nof 193 States.\r\nThe position of small and medium-sized States in an \r\nexpanded Security Council should figure prominently \r\n13-55456 7/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nin the light of the new emerging global geopolitical \r\nrealities and socioeconomic developments.\r\nMr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): As this is the first time that I have the honour \r\nto speak before the plenary of the sixty-eighth session \r\nof the General Assembly and on a matter of such vital \r\nimportance to us all as the current agenda item, the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nissues, allow me to express to the President my sincere \r\ncongratulations on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the apposite and \r\nclear way in which the President is guiding the debates \r\nduring this session and fully supports his efforts in \r\nthat regard. I am also very pleased at his initiative to \r\nconvene this meeting and at the new impetus he has \r\ngiven to this theme by reappointing Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin. Mr. Tanin has my delegation’s full confidence as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. We also express our full support for the \r\nPresident’s innovative initiative to appoint an advisory \r\ngroup. As he has explained, the role of the group is not \r\nto take decisions or to to supplant or usurp the work \r\nthat Ambassador Tanin will undertake. Simply, as its \r\nname implies, the group is to serve the President as an \r\nadvisory body with no binding character. \r\nMy delegation would like to thank Ambassador Liu \r\nJieyi of the People’s Republic of China for introducing \r\nthe report (A/68/2) of the Security Council yesterday, \r\non the occasion of the start of our debate on this issue \r\n(see A/68/PV.46).\r\nIt has been 68 years since the United Nations \r\nwas established, on 24 October 1945, following the \r\ndisastrous impact of the Second World War. Thirty-four \r\nyears later, in 1979, during the thirty-fourth session \r\nof the General Assembly, on the initiative of Algeria, \r\nArgentina, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Guyana, India, \r\nMaldives, Nepal, Nigeria and Sri Lanka, the question \r\nof equitable representation on the Security Council and \r\nthe increase in its membership was raised. A debate \r\nwas launched in that regard at the forty-seventh session, \r\nin 1992, when resolution 47/62 was adopted. Pursuant \r\nto that, the Secretary-General published a report with \r\ncomments made by the aforementioned Member States. \r\nThus, the United Nations is 68 years old, and for \r\n34 of those years we have been debating the need for \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\namendment to the Charter of the United Nations or \r\nadoption by a two-thirds majority. Kazakhstan believes \r\nthat any improvement in the working methods will \r\nnot limit the power of the Council or subordinate it to \r\nthe General Assembly, but rather will strengthen the \r\nSecurity Council to make it more efficient. It is critical \r\nto have all the proposals of Member States on the table \r\nfor the purpose of greater transparency, accountability \r\nand fairer participation, increased access to \r\ninformation through open briefings, thematic debates \r\nand consultations with States that are not members \r\nof the Security Council, the involvement of troop-\r\ncontributing countries in its decision-making processes \r\non peacekeeping operations and the easy availability of \r\nprovisional agendas, draft resolutions and presidential \r\nstatements.\r\nIt is equally imperative to strengthen the \r\ncooperation mechanism between the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly, since the latter represents \r\nthe interests of all Member States. In particular, \r\nthe most crucial and unresolved disputes in the \r\nCouncil could be discussed in the General Assembly \r\nto ascertain the positions of the majority of Member \r\nStates on vital issues, so as to make the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions as informed as possible. \r\nWe welcome the measures designed to increase the \r\nnumber of open meetings of the Security Council and \r\nthe decrease in the number of closed meetings to ensure \r\ngreater transparency. That is particularly important for \r\ncountries when the Council deliberates on the cases of \r\ntheir immediate neighbouring countries or those in the \r\nregion, because of the relevant inputs that can be made \r\nand to assess the interrelated impact and consequences.\r\nThe States that are not members of the Security \r\nCouncil need to know first-hand and objectively the \r\ndecisions and positions of the members of the Security \r\nCouncil — not through the lens of the mass media, \r\nwith its distortions. We also welcome the establishment \r\nof the advisory group to the President of the General \r\nAssembly and believe that it will serve the negotiating \r\nprocess as a whole and provide a balanced approach, \r\nincluding in its scope all positions and concerns \r\nexpressed by groups and Member States.\r\nTo conclude, I would again reiterate Kazakhstan’s \r\ncommitment to engaging in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and work in a spirit of compromise and \r\ncooperation to finalize a speedy reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. The reform process cannot wait much longer, \r\n8/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nAs President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo \r\nof Equatorial Guinea said during his statement at the \r\ngeneral debate,\r\n“Let us be honest with ourselves, because democracy, \r\nas a just and equitable system, should prevail in \r\nall the organs of the United Nations system, the \r\nepicentre of the international community, aspiring \r\nto peace, order and development.” (A/68/PV.13, p. 8)\r\nI am participating in this debate as the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Equatorial Guinea, which is a \r\nmember of the Committee of Ten of the African Union. \r\nIn that connection, I fully associate myself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nSierra Leone, His Excellency Mr. Vandi Chidi Minah, \r\nas coordinator of the Committee of Ten, and also with \r\nthe statement made by His Excellency Ambassador \r\nMr. Mootaz Ahmadein Khalil of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (see A/68/PV.46).\r\nIn that regard, we reaffirm the claim made by the \r\nAfrican continent to be fully and broadly represented \r\nin all decision-making bodies of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly in the Security Council, which is the main \r\ndecision-making organ on issues relating to international \r\npeace and security. The broad and full representation \r\nrequired by the African continent means obtaining at \r\nleats two permanent seats in the Security Council, with \r\nall the inherent privileges and prerogatives, as well as \r\nfive non-permanent seats.\r\nMembers will agree with me that it is totally \r\ninconceivable and unjustifiable that a continent such as \r\nAfrica, which has more than 1 billion people, the largest \r\nnumber of States Members of the United Nations and \r\nthe largest number of issues dealt with by the Security \r\nCouncil, does not to date have a single permanent seat on \r\nthe Security Council. In that regard, it should be noted \r\nthat the demand for seats for Africa on the Security \r\nCouncil is a demand and an inalienable right in the \r\nmodern world, especially in a global Organization such \r\nas the United Nations — a guarantor of the principles \r\nof justice, good governance and rights.\r\nI would like to conclude my brief statement by saying \r\nthat my country reiterates its position — the African \r\ncommon position — that we reject any provisional or \r\ntransitional proposals in the negotiations, as the main \r\nrequirements of such an approach would go against the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. That \r\nis what was decided at the Kampala Summit in July \r\n2010, reaffirmed at the African Union Summit held in \r\nWhile 68 is a very significant age for both people \r\nand States, it is even more important in the history of \r\nan international Organization that serves as a forum for \r\ndebating rights of every sort — human rights, the right \r\nto food, women’s rights, children’s rights, the right to \r\nthe self-determination of free peoples and so on. Is it \r\nnot fair that the time has come for the rights of countries \r\nand all regions to rightful representation in the Security \r\nCouncil to be recognized?\r\nIs it not already time for the African continent, \r\nwith 54 Member States in the United Nations — more \r\nthan any other region — and more than 70 per cent of \r\nthe issues discussed in the Security Council concerning \r\nit, to be given the right of representation in the Security \r\nCouncil, with the right to vote and to the veto, in order \r\nto actively participate in discussions on relevant issues? \r\nIn his statement at the general debate in September, \r\nSouth African President Jacob Zuma said: \r\n“We would like to challenge the Assembly today by \r\nsaying ‘Let us set ourselves the target to celebrate \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations in \r\n2015 with a reformed, more inclusive, democratic \r\nand representative Security Council!’” (A/68/PV.5, \r\np. 50)\r\nThat is two years from now. \r\nThat goal should guide the new process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, so that the United \r\nNations is adapted to the challenges of an international \r\norder that is completely different from that which \r\nprevailed 68 years ago. This is a new world, quite \r\ndifferent from the one that saw the establishment of \r\nthe United Nations. Today’s world is not the product \r\nof war, but of technological change. In the world today, \r\nat the United Nations, we recognize rights, dialogue, \r\ndemocracy, transparency and good governance. Those \r\nrealities should shape United Nations bodies as a whole, \r\nin particular the Security Council.\r\nAs we are approach the end of 2013, the international \r\nOrganization that is the United Nations, and through \r\nits General Assembly, has some promising prospects in \r\nthe next two years, including 2015, the year set for the \r\nfulfilment of the Millennium Development Goals. The \r\nAssembly should ensure that 2015, when the United \r\nNations will mark its seventieth anniversary, is also \r\nthe year when we achieve effective Security Council \r\nreform.\r\n13-55456 9/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\ndecision to establish an advisory group of eminent \r\nambassadors, which is charged with the important \r\ntask of producing the basis for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations while taking on board all the suggestions \r\nmade so far. We see this decision in the context of the \r\ncurrent momentum to move forward in the process of \r\nnegotiations on the question of equitable representation \r\nand an increase in the size of the Security Council, \r\nwhich is long overdue.\r\nIn our opinion, it is important to maintain a clear \r\ndistinction between the debate on enlarging the Council \r\nand the discussion on improving the working methods \r\napplied under its current composition. After last week’s \r\nopen debate on working methods (see S/PV.7052), we \r\nexpect that the Council will be able to build on several \r\nproposals made by a large number of the Member States. \r\nAs a member of the accountability, coherence and \r\ntransparency group, Slovenia will contribute further \r\nideas on how to enhance the accountability, coherence \r\nand transparency of the Security Council.\r\nWe regret that discussion has lagged on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and an increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. We believe that the enlargement of the \r\nCouncil would contribute to its effectiveness, improve \r\nits representation and bring fresh perspectives to the \r\ntable. It is apparent that the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in permanent and non-permanent membership \r\nhas gained broad support among the States Members \r\nof the United Nations. Slovenia remains convinced \r\nthat the Council should be expanded in both categories \r\nof membership. In the general debate at the sixty-\r\nthird session, Slovenia suggested a specific model \r\nfor Security Council expansion. We believe that our \r\nsuggestion and other specific past proposals should be \r\napproached head-on and that they should be taken into \r\naccount by the advisory group.\r\nSlovenia views the determination and commitment \r\nof the President of the General Assembly as an \r\nopportunity to come to meaningful conclusions that \r\nshould be implemented in the light of the upcoming \r\nUnited Nations anniversary in 2015. Prolonged debates \r\nhave revealed the discontent of many Member States, \r\nand it is high time to address that issue in a proper \r\nand concrete way that will adapt the Security Council \r\nto new challenges and reflect the realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. I can assure the Assembly that \r\nSlovenia will play a constructive role in the process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nAddis Ababa in January 2011, unanimously reasserted \r\nagain during the Malabo Summit in July 2011 and \r\nratified and supported in subsequent summits. To that \r\nend, the Republic of Equatorial Guinea reiterates its \r\nfull confidence in Ambassador Zahir Tanin in driving \r\nthe Security Council reform process. We also reiterate \r\nour confidence that all of Africa’s partners, friends and \r\nallies from all regions and continents will support us so \r\nthat this African claim can become a tangible reality.\r\nMy country and Government in general believe \r\nthat all States, regions and interest groups should \r\nbring their positions closer together in the context of \r\nthis reform process, so as to achieve equitable, fair and \r\nobjective representation on the Security Council and \r\nwithin the United Nations system. We hope that the \r\nSecurity Council in particular and the United Nations \r\nsystem as a whole will be restructured in a manner that \r\nmore broadly takes into account the interests of all the \r\nStates and geographical regions of the international \r\ncommunity. That will require all States to continue to \r\nmove forward and to overcome the obstacles that prevent \r\nthem from achieving a genuine and more representative \r\nmembership of the Security Council. We therefore hope \r\nfor resounding success in the new negotiating process.\r\nMr. Logar (Slovenia):  I would like to thank you, \r\nMadam, for convening today’s important meeting.\r\nSlovenia believes that it would be more efficient \r\nif the General Assembly were to hold two separate \r\ndebates — one on the Security Council report \r\n(A/68/2) and the other on the question of the equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters — since both \r\ntopics need to be thoroughly discussed. We believe that \r\nthe content of the report is of high importance for all \r\nMembers, and would therefore like to examine it in \r\ndepth before discussing it further. Nevertheless, I would \r\nlike to thank the representative of China, Mr. Liu Jieyi, \r\nfor introducing the Security Council report covering \r\nthe period from 1 August 2012 to 31 July 2013.\r\nSlovenia welcomes the initiative taken by \r\nAmbassador John Ashe, President of the General \r\nAssembly, to reconvene the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform early in this \r\nsession of the Assembly. We would like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, on his reappointment as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We sincerely hope that \r\nthis round of negotiations will lead to tangible results and \r\na successful outcome. We also respect the President’s \r\n10/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nsituation in the Territory of Western Sahara, because it \r\ntook place outside the work of the Council.\r\nMembers of the Council are right to report only what \r\nhappened in the Council Chamber. Since everything is \r\nhappening in the corridors, within the small group of \r\nfriends and in consultation outside the formal meetings, \r\nthey have the right not to report to us, but then we miss \r\nthe point. We do not know what happens. I know one \r\nquestion, but I do not know another one. In the future, \r\nthe records we transmit to future generations will not \r\nallow them to know what happened on various issues. \r\nThat is why more transparency is of the essence, and \r\nthat is why we are insisting that we achieve a speedy \r\nand timely reform of the Security Council.\r\nAnother issue that the Member States might have \r\nnoticed is that, since the reopening of the Secretariat \r\nand conference buildings, since the renovations \r\nwithin the framework of the capital master plan, some \r\nchanges have been introduced to the way the Security \r\nCouncil interacts with the Member States. We, the \r\n178 delegations that are not members of the Security \r\nCouncil, are no longer allowed to approach the Security \r\nCouncil consultations room. Actually, there is a \r\nprohibition in the form of a red sign stating that it is a \r\nprivate zone. One cannot reach the German lounge that \r\nGermany generously equipped a long time ago to allow \r\ndelegations to sit and interact with the elected members \r\nof the Security Council, representing the membership, \r\nand to be informed about the proceedings and work of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nI would like to mention that the consultations room \r\nis an informal setting, according to the Charter. The \r\nCharter has established that the Council meets in the \r\nCouncil Chamber, and that we are entitled to attend the \r\ndeliberations of the Council on any question related to \r\ninternational peace and security. In order to prepare \r\nfor the debate, the members of the Council happen \r\nto meet outside the Chamber in a corridor, to have a \r\ncoffee or not and to exchange views before the meeting. \r\nThat corridor became the consultations room, but it \r\nhas no status whatsoever, and we are entitled to cut the \r\nfunding of the informal consultations of the Security \r\nCouncil on the basis that they are not in conformity \r\nwith the Charter. Moreover, we are not even allowed to \r\napproach the antechamber of the consultations room. I \r\nrely on the wisdom of the permanent members to help \r\nthe general membership to improve their relations with \r\nthe Council’s work.\r\nMr. Benmehidi (Algeria):  I am pleased to see you \r\npresiding over this meeting, Madam. If it were up to \r\nAlgeria, we would have liked to see Security Council \r\nreform achieved under your presidency today. I would \r\nlike to thank you for convening this joint debate on \r\nagenda item 29, “Report of the Security Council”, \r\nlinked with agenda item 123, “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and related matters”. It is important \r\nthat we look at the way the Security Council is working \r\nin order to correct what needs to be corrected. So we \r\nwork on that link. In that regard, I would like to thank \r\nAmbassador Liu Jieyi, representative of China and \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month, for \r\nintroducing the report of the Security Council (A/68/2), \r\ncovering the activities of the Council from 1 August \r\n2012 to 31 July 2013.\r\nWith respect to item 123, allow me to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin on his reappointment as Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiation process and to \r\nreiterate Algeria’s commitment to working with him in \r\norder to ensure the speedy and comprehensive reform \r\nof the Security Council.\r\nAlgeria aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the African \r\nGroup (see A/68/PV.46).\r\nAt a time of profound changes on the international \r\nlandscape, Security Council reform has become more \r\nurgent. Why? For instance, in document A/68/2, \r\ncovering the reporting period of the Security Council, \r\none observes that there are very few elements that allow \r\nmembers of the General Assembly to have a sense of \r\nthe kind of debate taking place on the various agenda \r\nitems. I have in mind one particular agenda item that I \r\nhappen to follow closely — the question of the Western \r\nSahara. With respect to the debate that took place in \r\nApril 2013 (see S/PV.6951), during the reporting period, \r\nthe report does not reflect what actually happened.\r\nThere was a very tense debate in the midst of a \r\nlooming diplomatic crisis between important members \r\nof the Security Council and one party to the conflict in \r\nthe Western Sahara, but it took place in the informal \r\ndiscussions before the item was actually considered in \r\nthe formal meeting. There is therefore no mention in \r\nthe report of the attempt by responsible members of \r\nthe Security Council to propose extending the mandate \r\nof the United Nations Mission for the Referendum \r\nin Western Sahara and to monitor the human rights \r\n13-55456 11/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nActually, I did not want to get to this point. I do not \r\nsee the Permanent Representatives of Germany, Brazil, \r\nIndia and Japan in the Hall. I will make my proposal \r\nto them on 15 November within the framework of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations because I do not want \r\nto repeat myself.\r\nI would like to convey our call on Ambassador Tanin \r\nto address the status of the third revision of the \r\ncompilation. We all complained about the incursion \r\nof Ambassador Tanin into our prerogatives, trying to \r\ninterpret our positions. Let us go back to the second \r\nrevision and take it from there. We are ready to \r\nhelp Ambassador Tanin, who is an asset. He has the \r\ninstitutional memory and he knows where we can \r\nmeet. We are ready to work with him by no later than \r\nmid-November.\r\nMr. Dos Santos (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly \r\non his timely initiative to undertake work in this \r\narea. I also express the appreciation of the delegation \r\nof Paraguay to Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, for his important role \r\nas Chair of the previous rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We wish him success in the new round \r\nbeginning at this session. We would also like to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of China for introducing \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/68/2).\r\nThe Government of Paraguay maintains that \r\nexpanding the Security Council is necessary in order \r\nto strengthen and update the Organization with a view \r\nto making it more effective and equitable, as mandated \r\nby the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1). \r\nThat process, which is proceeding in the form of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, must be accompanied \r\nby a reform of the Council’s working methods, since if \r\nthe Security Council is more democratic, representative, \r\ntransparent and efficient, its decisions will have greater \r\nlegitimacy.\r\nAs stated in the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nCouncil’s primary function is to preserve international \r\npeace and security. The increasing expansion of the \r\npowers of the Council to other issues that already \r\nhave dedicated forums for discussion undermines the \r\nauthority of the General Assembly and other organs of \r\nthe Organization, which is a cause for concern.\r\nOver the past few years, my country has followed \r\nwith growing interest the rounds of intergovernmental \r\nAs for other innovations that have been introduced, \r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General on having \r\noccupied the former office of the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, and I understand that the President \r\nof the Council has now been assigned a smaller office \r\nin the back. I express my sympathy for the elected \r\nmembers, which are losing an opportunity to provide \r\nsome visibility to their short term of membership in \r\nthe Council, but it is for the current and future elected \r\nmembers to address this issue.\r\nAnother aspect of the work of the Security Council \r\nis the principle that those who have a stake in any agenda \r\nitem should be able to participate in the debate or interact \r\nwith the Council. In the case of the Western Sahara, on \r\nthe occasion of the most recent consultations, which took \r\nplace on 30 November 2012, the representative of the \r\nFrente Polisario was denied access to the vicinity of the \r\nSecurity Council. As we all know, there are new rules, \r\nbut in addition to that, he was further excluded from the \r\narea. It has been a tradition that those identified by the \r\nCouncil as the parties to a conflict — in this case, the \r\nKingdom of Morocco and the Frente Polisario — can \r\nmake their case to the members of the Council and to \r\nthe membership through the stakeout. He was denied \r\na chance to speak at the stakeout. The necessary claim \r\nhas been filed with those responsible, and here also I am \r\nconfident that the wisdom of the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, which are no doubt concerned \r\nabout maintaining good relations with the users of the \r\nCouncil, will allow for a speedy resolution of this issue.\r\nAs for the report of the Security Council, it is up \r\nto us to decide whether we are to continue with the \r\nsituation and are satisfied, or we are to increase our \r\nefforts. Algeria supports the intention of the President \r\nof the Assembly to increase efforts in order to speed up \r\nthe process. We support him — and we supported him \r\nwithin the framework of the African Group — in the \r\nestablishment of the advisory group.\r\nWe caution against encroaching upon the \r\nprerogatives of the membership. The President has the \r\nright to establish a group of friends to receive advice \r\nand to make proposals to the membership. Let us avoid \r\nmaking the advisory group a body that is tasked with \r\ndrafting texts without being sufficiently representative \r\nof all the positions in the debate. However, the President \r\nhas the right to listen to the group and to make proposals \r\nto us, and we encourage him to do so. We encourage \r\nall those who have complained that Security Council \r\nreform has taken too long to consider the real causes.\r\n12/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nTherefore, Peru believes that it is time to proceed to a \r\ndynamic, informal drafting process that leads us to a \r\nnegotiating text with clear alternatives that enjoys the \r\nsupport and, above all, commitment of Member States.\r\nWe are grateful for the valuable compilation work \r\ncarried out by the Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We now need to hold text-based \r\nnegotiations in order to overcome entrenched positions \r\nand identify and process the options available to us so \r\nthat we can move forward towards negotiating work \r\nwith tangible, balanced and representative results, \r\nalways on the basis of the principle that it must be a \r\ntransparent and inclusive process with a view to the \r\ntimely reform of the Security Council.\r\nPeru welcomed the recent creation of an advisory \r\ngroup responsible for collecting the positions of the \r\nvarious negotiating groups and countries that are \r\ninvolved in this debate, on the understanding that \r\nthis is part of the efforts to revive the process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, in accordance with General Assembly decision \r\n62/557.\r\nPeru reiterates once again its conviction that, \r\nif the Security Council is to adapt to new realities, \r\nit must incorporate new members, permanent and \r\nnon-permanent alike, in order to promote fair and \r\nequitable regional representation that represents a \r\nchange from the current status quo.\r\nWith regard to the question of the veto, Peru has \r\nconsistently maintained a principled position aimed \r\nultimately at its elimination. Now, in a constructive \r\nspirit, my delegation believes that the permanent \r\nmembers should commit to assessing, as a first step, a \r\npossible limitation on the use of the veto, relying on the \r\nexisting rule established in paragraph 3 of Article 27 of \r\nthe Charter.\r\nAdditionally, Peru believes it is important to reach \r\nconsensus on the possibility of establishing precise \r\nlimits for the use of the veto, eliminating the possibility \r\nof applying it in cases of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and successive acts of f lagrant violation \r\nof human rights or international humanitarian law. I \r\nwelcome the French position on this issue, while calling \r\non the other permanent members to explore that option.\r\nIt is also important for the Security Council to \r\nmake progress on a serious and comprehensive self-\r\nassessment of its work in order to enhance its legitimacy \r\nand the efficiency and effectiveness of its work. In that \r\nnegotiations undertaken on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council. In this respect, we believe \r\nthat the Security Council should consider a balanced \r\ngeographical distribution for its membership, in \r\naccordance with the principle enshrined in Article 2 of \r\nthe Charter concerning the sovereign equality of States.\r\nRegarding the veto, Paraguay supports its \r\nelimination. We also believe that there must be effective \r\ncommunication between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which is the most representative \r\nand democratic organ of the United Nations system. We \r\ntherefore need to systematically hold meetings between \r\nthe President of the Assembly and the President of \r\nthe Security Council, which will help to improve the \r\ntransparency of the Council’s work.\r\nFinally, we are fully confident that the Council will \r\nultimately adapt to the changing times of this century \r\nby becoming more representative and improving the \r\neffectiveness, legitimacy and implementation of its \r\ndecisions.\r\nMr. Velásquez (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the convening of this meeting to \r\ncontinue discussing one of the core issues related to the \r\nreform of the Organization — the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters.\r\nI would like to highlight the work done by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, in heading up the informal \r\nplenary meetings of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non the question of equitable representation on and \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters, and we therefore welcome their ongoing help \r\nin this process during the current session.\r\nThe significant and substantive discussions that we \r\nhave carried out during the nine rounds of the process \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform have highlighted the significant agreement \r\namong Members regarding the urgent need to adapt the \r\nstructure of our Organization to adequately reflect the \r\nchanges that have arisen in the international context \r\nsince the most recent reform of that body. In that \r\nrespect, Peru believes that new impetus must be given \r\nto the negotiations to advance the goal of achieving \r\na renewed, renovated, expanded, more democratic, \r\nrepresentative, effective and efficient Security Council \r\nwhose working methods that are more transparent. \r\n13-55456 13/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\ncountries in both categories. In that context, it is \r\nresolutely in favour of the African common position, \r\nas outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus. In addition, \r\nwe support calls for the provision of a special rotating \r\nseat for small island developing States in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council, and in that context we call for an \r\nincrease in the size of the Security Council from the \r\ncurrent 15 to approximately 27.\r\nWith a view to promoting the equality of States, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago supports the elimination of the \r\nveto. However, in the event of its retention, we consider \r\nthat all permanent members of an expanded and \r\nreformed Security Council must have the same rights \r\nand privileges as existing permanent States.\r\nIn the vein of efficiency, we call for improved \r\nworking methods of the Council so as to increase the \r\ninvolvement of non-members in its work, as appropriate, \r\nand to enhance the Council’s accountability and \r\ntransparency. In addition, Trinidad and Tobago supports \r\nthe position advanced by CARICOM as it relates to \r\nthe relationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and encourages the adoption of \r\nappropriate measures to enable the General Assembly \r\nto function effectively as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago believes that the need for \r\nSecurity Council reform is evident, as the international \r\ncommunity is faced with new and evolving global \r\nsecurity challenges, as well as issues of human rights \r\nand conscience. With the continuing evolution of the \r\nglobal political climate, the need for a Security Council \r\nthat represents, more broadly, the geopolitical realities \r\nof the twenty-first century is becoming increasingly \r\nobvious.\r\nIn the World Summit Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1), international leaders supported an \r\nearly reform of the Security Council. The pace of that \r\nreform, however, must be increased if we are not to be \r\novertaken by new circumstances that could repeatedly \r\ntest the fabric of relationships among Member States of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago further reiterates CARICOM’s \r\ncall for greater urgency in achieving lasting Security \r\nCouncil reform, and we extend our continued support \r\nfor decision 64/568 on that matter. We congratulate \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, on his reappointment as Chair of the \r\nregard, my delegation believes that it is of the utmost \r\nimportance to make progress towards a concrete reform \r\nof the working methods of the Council, so that they \r\nare more transparent and efficient. To that end, we \r\nbelieve that there is a need to hold more open meetings, \r\nincrease the number of meetings to update members on \r\nthe topics of discussion, and ensure that such meetings \r\nare substantive in nature and held in a timely manner.\r\nWe also believe it important to strengthen the \r\npractice of Security Council consultations with troop-\r\ncontributing members in advance of the Council’s \r\ndeliberations on the subject, and to ensure inclusion \r\nand regularity in the practice of self-assessment and \r\nthe review of the implementation of Council decisions. \r\nSimilarly, we welcome the recent initiative to hold \r\nmeetings to review the work of the Council at the end \r\nof each month, and we call for this beneficial practice \r\nto be continued in order to increase the transparency of \r\nthe Council. We also appreciate the practice of holding \r\nopen debates on issues being considered by the Council. \r\nHowever, this should not be a mere formality, and the \r\ndebates should reflect the views of all Members of the \r\nOrganization.\r\nEvery process should lead to the adoption of a \r\ndecision. Continuing to reiterate our well-known \r\nnational positions merely postpones an important \r\ndecision that is supported by a majority of the \r\nmembership. If, as unanimously expressed here, we \r\nwant to reform the Security Council, we must translate \r\nthis desire into concrete commitments. I reaffirm \r\nmy country’s willingness to continue to participate \r\nconstructively in the informal plenary meetings of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the question \r\nof equitable representation in and membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and related matters.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago): Trinidad and \r\nTobago aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Guyana on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), Japan on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Four, and Saint Kitts and Nevis on behalf \r\nof the L.69 group in encouraging inclusive Security \r\nCouncil reform, and takes this opportunity to deliver \r\nour remarks on agenda item 123, “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago unequivocally supports \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\nmember categories of the Security Council, and as such \r\nit advocates for the expansion of the roles of developing \r\n14/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nthat process, in its inclusive and holistic nature and its \r\nunity of purpose and intention, can bring about reform \r\nthat is meaningful, representative and democratic.\r\nThe year 2015 will mark the 10-year anniversary \r\nof the 2005 World Summit, in which global leaders \r\nrecognized, among other things, the need for an early \r\nreform of the Security Council. Furthermore, it has \r\nbeen nearly five years since the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations began. In decision 62/557, Member States \r\nresolved, among other things, to negotiate in good \r\nfaith, with mutual respect and in an open, inclusive \r\nand transparent manner, seeking a solution that could \r\ngarner the widest possible political acceptance of \r\nMember States.\r\nWe believe that the time has come to show the \r\nnecessary political resolve, realism and commitment \r\nto moving the process forward and to agreeing \r\nconsensually on a reform model that would address the \r\nconcerns and aspirations of all involved. We need to \r\ncreate a more fair and representative Council that can \r\nreflect the twenty-first century’s reality and tackle its \r\ncomplex challenges. In order to make progress, we need \r\nto begin serious and committed text-based negotiations. \r\nWe do not have the luxury of delaying this process any \r\nlonger, since we will soon be entering the tenth round \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations. Let us remind \r\nourselves that the world needs to see our determination \r\nto keep the United Nations relevant, involved and \r\nresolute, with the ability to address its problems and to \r\nfulfil its hopes.\r\nMrs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group. We join others in thanking the \r\nPermanent Representative of the People’s Republic of \r\nChina for introducing the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/68/2) and the \r\nUnited States of America for preparing its introduction.\r\nSecurity Council reform is a process that can be \r\nguided only by all States members of the General \r\nAssembly, not just by a few. It is also urgently needed. \r\nThe Council’s inaction for over two years concerning \r\nthe crisis in Syria was the latest example of the paralysis \r\nthat often prevents it from responding in a timely and \r\neffective manner, and that needs to be corrected.\r\nIn that regard, Mexico acknowledges France’s \r\nrecent proposal to limit the use of the veto, particularly \r\nin situations involving war crimes, crimes against \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform, and encourage the progressive spirit that those \r\nnegotiations espouse.\r\nIn closing, Trinidad and Tobago would like to \r\nexpress its gratitude to the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, \r\nfor his efforts in promoting Security Council reform, \r\nand to current President John Ashe for his efforts to \r\ncontinue discussions towards a more representative and \r\neffective Security Council. It is our hope that tangible \r\noutcomes, including a meaningful action plan, will be \r\nthe outcome of those deliberations, in the interest of \r\nglobal peace and security.\r\nMr. Emiliou (Cyprus): Cyprus welcomes this \r\ntimely debate on the important matter of the equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council and related matters. As the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has noted, United \r\nNations reform represents an important element in our \r\noverall effort to strengthen the Organization, without \r\nwhich the Organization runs the risk of becoming \r\ninconsequential.\r\nWe welcome the reappointment of Ambassador Tanin \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, and \r\nwe look forward to the session’s first meeting in that \r\nframework. We also take note of the President’s decision \r\nto form an advisory group that, as we understand it, \r\nwill provide him with input aimed at reflecting a \r\ncomprehensive approach to the positions and ideas put \r\nforward in the negotiations so far, and pointing to the \r\noptions available for charting the road ahead.\r\nCyprus supports a comprehensive report of the \r\nSecurity Council based on decision 62/557, which, \r\namong other things, includes the improvement of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods in order to enchance its \r\ncapacities and legitimacy and the effectiveness of \r\nits decisions and actions, as well as to increase the \r\ntransparency of its work. In addition, we support \r\nexpanding the membership of the Security Council \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories. \r\nWe believe that all five key issues identified in the \r\naforementioned decisions — namely, categories \r\nof membership, the question of the veto, regional \r\nrepresentation, the size of an enlarged Council, working \r\nmethods, and the relationship between the Council and \r\nthe General Assembly — should be addressed and \r\nresolved in a package deal through the member-driven \r\nprocess of the intergovernmental negotiations. Only \r\n13-55456 15/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nwe recognize and support their claim for equal rights \r\nand for a solution to the entire continent’s historic \r\nlack of representation. We see their rightful claim as \r\nan expression of the strength that gives them unity and \r\nconsensus, and not as an individual desire for power \r\nand privilege. We reiterate our willingness to continue \r\nto work with Africa in promoting formulas for equitable \r\nrepresentation for all regional groups.\r\nLike the rest of Uniting for Consensus, we took note \r\nof the letter of 22 October, by which Member States \r\nwere informed of the decision to create an advisory \r\ngroup on Security Council reform, with the proposal \r\nthat it produce a basis for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. However, we do not believe this to \r\nbe a body that represents the vast majority of the \r\nmembership of the Organization. Mexico reiterates its \r\nappreciation and full respect for the members of the \r\nadvisory group. We reiterate, however, that the only \r\nforum with the authority to make decisions on Security \r\nCouncil reform is that of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations within the General Assembly, where we \r\nneed no one to interpret our wishes. We appreciate \r\nAmbassador Ashe’s assurances to our group this week \r\nregarding the mandate and objectives of his advisory \r\ngroup. We are encouraged by the fact that it will not \r\ndraft any official documents or have the capacity to \r\nnegotiate, summarize any of the reform proposals that \r\nhave been circulating for many years or prepare any \r\ndraft resolutions. However, as we have seen throughout \r\nthis debate, there are still conflicting interpretations, \r\npromoted by some members of the group, regarding \r\nits mandate. We trust the President’s word and believe \r\nthat his commitment will prevail over the national \r\npositions expressed by some members of his advisory \r\ngroup. Mexico will not support any working document \r\nissued by the group unless it has the full approval of all \r\nMember States, which ensures impartiality, including \r\non the different positions of various Member States.\r\nBoth nationally and as a member of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group, Mexico will continue to participate \r\nconstructively in the forthcoming session of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, with openness and \r\ncomplete transparency.\r\nMr. Moura (Portugal): I would like to commend the \r\nPresident for convening today’s meeting and launching \r\nthe intergovernmental process on an important subject \r\nat an early stage of this session. I would also like to \r\nwelcome the reappointment of Ambassador Zahir Tanin \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nhumanity and genocide. We believe that would be \r\na step in the right direction and would reaffirm the \r\ncommitment of the five permanent members of the \r\nCouncil to its primary responsibility for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. Mexico is eager to \r\nwork with all those interested in the proposal in order \r\nto find a formula that can enable it to be applied.\r\nMexico reiterates its commitment to continuing to \r\nwork on a comprehensive, transparent and equitable \r\nreform process without artificial deadlines. We \r\nshould not be under the illusion that an agreement \r\nwill be reached because the Organization’s seventieth \r\nanniversary is on the horizon. It may be a good target if \r\nevery State has the political will to reach a compromise, \r\nbut we must not forget what happened during the \r\nsixtieth anniversary. Cyclical celebrations do not bring \r\nmagical solutions that are not backed up by broad, \r\nsolid agreements. As long as the lack of f lexibility and \r\npolitical will on the part of some is aimed at privileging \r\na few, no reform is possible. We should concentrate our \r\nefforts on the substance and not the calendar.\r\nThe ultimate result of our negotiation process \r\nshould be an effective, transparent Security Council \r\nthat is representative of all Member States and \r\nprovides greater opportunities for countries that \r\nwish to serve on the Council on a more frequent and \r\nprolonged basis, as well as those that have never been \r\nmembers. Mexico hopes that the recent reappointment \r\nof Ambassador Zahir Tanin as facilitator of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process will lead to \r\nsubstantial progress in facilitating a process that is not \r\nbased on bias or a tendency to interpret the positions \r\nof Member States in return for support. It should be a \r\ncomprehensive process that takes into account the five \r\nkey issues in decision 62/557 and includes realistic, \r\nviable and comprehensive proposals. The formula for \r\nreform enlarging the permanent membership, which \r\nsome countries in the Council are pushing, exacerbates \r\nthe inequality that is intrinsic to the Council’s current \r\ncomposition, to the detriment of the goals of greater \r\nrepresentativeness, transparency and accountability to \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMexico and Uniting for Consensus seek not to \r\nimpose their views on the rest of the membership, \r\nbut to find a compromise solution with which as \r\nmany Member States as possible can agree. As Latin \r\nAmericans, we understand perfectly the desire of the \r\nAfrican Group for fair representation that will enable \r\nit to play its rightful role in the Council. In particular, \r\n16/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nof many of the other States to serving on the Council. \r\nThat is something we are not inclined to accept. \r\nCreating a new category of seats would aggravate \r\nthe already existing division among permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members by including an intermediate \r\ncategory of semi-permanent members. In our view, that \r\nwould neither serve the wider membership nor help the \r\nSecurity Council in its work, and would in fact result in \r\na less representative and effective body.\r\nThirdly, the notion of permanent membership is \r\ntightly linked with the very notion of civility. It is as \r\ninherent to the category of permanent membership as \r\nrotation is to non-permanent seats, which should allow \r\nas many States as possible the opportunity, if they so \r\nwish, to serve on the Council.\r\nFourthly, proposals to increase the membership in \r\nboth categories have been gathering increased support \r\namong delegations. While differences still exist, \r\nincreasing convergencies related to the issue have \r\nbeen identified in the course of the recent round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in the form of several \r\nproposals on the table, including the African position. \r\nLet us move forward and build on those convergencies. \r\nThat should not prevent us from focusing when the \r\ntime comes. However, if divergencies persist, we will \r\ncontinue our efforts to build an even larger common \r\nground in the future.\r\nIn conclusion, the reform of the Security Council \r\ncannot be delayed time and time again. As recently \r\nstated by my Minister for Foreign Affairs in the general \r\ndebate,\r\n“It is increasingly difficult to justify why countries \r\nsuch as Brazil and India are not permanent members \r\nof the Security Council.” (A/68/PV.18, p. 39)\r\nMoreover, we are of the strong view that Africa \r\nabsolutely deserves permanent representation on the \r\nSecurity Council. Africa must be treated with justice \r\nand in a way that reflects its size, its economic growth \r\nand its weight in today’s world.\r\nWe should avoid engaging in repetitive exercises \r\nthat end up feeding our divergencies. Rather, we should \r\nnarrow our focus on that which can unite and lead to \r\na larger common ground and make possible further \r\nefforts towards consensus. In that respect, we see merit \r\nin centring future intergovernmental negotiations on \r\na suitable basis that may help to focus on the main \r\nelements of reform and narrow to the extent possible \r\nthe different positions on the table.\r\nThe question we are discussing today is about \r\nequitable representation, but it is ultimately also about \r\nthe efficacy of an organ, the Security Council, that acts \r\non behalf of us all, pursuant to the Charter of the United \r\nNations, to maintain international peace and security. \r\nIn order to exercise such responsibility and address the \r\nchallenges the world faces today, we need a strong and \r\neffective Security Council. And a strong and effective \r\nSecurity Council is one whose composition reflects the \r\ngeopolitical realities and emerging regional Powers of \r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nThe original structure of the Security Council, \r\nwith permanent and non-permanent members, has not \r\nchanged. Could it be different? Hardly, since the structure \r\nresults directly from the Charter of the United Nations \r\nthat we have all ratified, entrusting the permanent \r\nmembers with a specific guardian role concerning any \r\nmodification of its provisions. No reform of the Council \r\ncan avoid it. The need for ratification of any Charter \r\nmodification by the permanent members leads us to the \r\npragmatic conclusion that both categories of permanent \r\nand non-permanent members are here to stay.\r\nUnder that assumption, in our view the only way \r\nto make the Council more representative is to increase \r\nboth categories of its membership. Moreover, to find \r\nthe right balance in the representation of the Council \r\nas a whole, we must examine the composition of each \r\ncategory, give all regional groups due participation \r\nin the permanent category, which is still not the case, \r\nand ensure broader participation and representation \r\nin the non-permanent category. In the 1960s, the \r\nGeneral Assembly opted to increase membership \r\nin the non-permanent category only. We were then \r\n115 members, but five decades later, with 193 members, \r\nwe can no longer accept increasing its seats again in \r\nonly one membership category, thereby reinforcing \r\neven further the existing correlation. We should aim at \r\nan increased membership in both categories if we want \r\nto achieve equitable representation on the Council as a \r\nwhole.\r\nSecondly, when addressing such enlargement, \r\none should be cautious in order to maintain an \r\nappropriate balance and equitable representation in the \r\nnon-permanent category. For medium-size and small \r\nStates — which, I note, constitute the vast majority \r\nof States Members of the United Nations — that is of \r\ncrucial importance. Any proposal that would reserve \r\na number of those seats for certain States for long-\r\nterm mandates would substantially hinder the access \r\n13-55456 17/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nexpansion in the category of permanent membership. \r\nNew Zealand believes we will make progress only if \r\nwe are willing to explore and even to test solutions that \r\nadvance the interests of the wider membership and not \r\nof just a few.\r\nThat is why New Zealand has expressed support for \r\nan intermediate solution that would offer the Assembly’s \r\nmore powerful members the prospect of Security \r\nCouncil membership for longer periods — including \r\nthe possibility of immediate re-election — and that \r\nwould also expand the number of seats that are held for \r\ntwo-year terms, thus ensuring that smaller States would \r\nnot be shut out of the Council.\r\nWhile we are certainly willing to consider other \r\nideas, we believe that an intermediate solution of that \r\nnature is more likely to secure the support of two thirds \r\nof the membership in a vote of the General Assembly, \r\nand also to achieve ratification by the same majority — a \r\nkey Charter requirement that is sometimes overlooked \r\nby those who seek to tally votes in support of their \r\nrespective positions.\r\nThis debate is focused principally on the size, \r\ncategories of membership, regional representation, \r\nworking methods and the use of the veto in an enlarged \r\nand reformed Security Council. We must remember, \r\nhowever, that those issues are only a part of the bigger \r\nquestion of overall Security Council reform. Equally \r\nimportant is the question of improving the current \r\nCouncil’s working methods — and that is change which \r\nshould be achievable even in the shorter term.\r\nWe see that as an issue separate from structural \r\nreform. As my Prime Minister said when addressing \r\nthe Assembly in September,\r\n“[t]he problems are more systemic and relate both \r\nto the composition and the formal and informal \r\nprocesses of the Council” (A/68/PV.14, p. 9).\r\nConsiderations of efficiency and realpolitik do not \r\njustify denying elected members an effective voice \r\nin Council decision-making. For that reason, we urge \r\npermanent members to take a hard look at the way in \r\nwhich they conduct their business. They could do much \r\nto assuage concerns about the legitimacy of Council \r\ndecisions if they were more open and responsive to \r\nthe views of the wider membership and if they treated \r\nelected members of the Council, whose votes are needed \r\nfor all formal Council decisions, more as partners. In \r\nthat regard, we particularly welcome the suggestion \r\nfrom the delegation of France that there be a voluntary \r\nMy delegation again commends the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for opening that path of negotiations \r\nto members and for committing his leadership to the \r\nintergovernmental process on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. On our part, we are ready to engage actively \r\nand constructively in that process.\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\ncommends the President of the General Assembly for \r\ntaking up the challenge of Security Council reform, \r\nthe need for which was again strongly emphasized in \r\nmany statements from our leaders in the general debate \r\nearlier in the session.\r\nThere is little doubt that structures designed in \r\nthe 1945 post-war world for an intergovernmental \r\nOrganization of just 51 Members are no longer best-\r\nsuited to today’s 193-Member body. That is particularly \r\nso with the Security Council, whose membership has \r\nbeen expanded only once in the past 68 years, nearly \r\n50 years ago, when, as the representative of Portugal \r\nhas just pointed out, the membership of the Assembly \r\nnumbered just over 100 — little more than half its \r\npresent membership.\r\nFor whatever reasons, back in 1945 some very \r\ninfluential States were left out of the original power-\r\nsharing arrangements. They and those whose power \r\nhas emerged in the ensuing years understandably \r\nnow chafe at being excluded from the inner circle \r\nof the Organization’s most powerful body. We also \r\nshare the view of many smaller States that the current \r\nnumber of non-permanent seats and the associated \r\ngeographic groups no longer ensures either fairness in \r\nrepresentation or opportunity for election. There are \r\ntoo many faces pressed against the window. Change is \r\nneeded.\r\nHowever, the past two decades of debate have \r\nshown that there is no obvious or easy solution to \r\nrectifying the democratic deficit that is inherent in the \r\nCouncil’s current composition, and the lack of progress \r\ninevitably raises serious questions as to whether the \r\nOrganization is likely in the foreseeable future to agree \r\nany fundamental structural reform of the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nIn New Zealand’s view, that democratic deficit \r\nwill not be fixed simply by adding another group of \r\npermanent members, even if that might be considered \r\ndesirable, or, by extending veto rights. Nor will the \r\ndeficit be fixed by insisting on the status quo, despite \r\nthe deep misgivings of some Members regarding any \r\n18/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\naim during this General Assembly session. For all those \r\nreasons, Ireland strongly supports the timely initiative \r\ntaken by the President of the General Assembly.\r\nIn our view, the five reform elements outlined \r\nin decision 62/577 are interrelated parts of a single \r\npackage. Success is contingent on agreement in all \r\nfive areas. That, we believe, should create the scope \r\nfor compromise and make it easier rather than more \r\ndifficult to reach overall agreement.\r\nHow might the future Council be composed? \r\nWe see substantial merit in the various models for \r\nreform that have been put forward to date. All grapple \r\nwith the challenge of adjusting the composition \r\nso as to correct the anomalies and problems of \r\nunderrepresentation, which are widely acknowledged. \r\nAfrican underrepresentation is perhaps the most blatant \r\ninjustice. There is, however, disagreement as to the \r\nbest way forward. No single model as currently put \r\nforward commands overwhelming support. It could be \r\nargued that the stalemate to which that has led is in \r\nfact undermining the very institution we are seeking \r\nto improve.\r\nMy delegation believes that whichever reform \r\nmodel is chosen should be capable of attracting very \r\nextensive support across the membership. We need \r\nto get Security Council reform right. We must be \r\ncertain that whatever new arrangements we make are \r\noverwhelmingly accepted if the aim of enhancing the \r\nCouncil’s democratic legitimacy, restoring its authority \r\nand improving its effectiveness is to be achieved. \r\nThat points towards compromise and exploration of \r\nthe middle ground. We should be willing to look at \r\nalternative ways forward that would retain key elements \r\nof the main models on offer but seek to build bridges \r\nbetween them.\r\nThere is division over the question of additional \r\npermanent seats, with strongly argued positions on both \r\nsides. If we are to reach an agreement that will command \r\nthe broadest possible support and therefore be solid \r\nand durable, imaginative approaches will be needed \r\nin addressing the claims to permanent membership \r\nthat are made by a number of countries and regions. \r\nIreland would also wish to see arrangements that do not \r\ndiminish the opportunities for smaller States to serve \r\non the Council at regular intervals.\r\nTurning to another aspect of the debate, Ireland \r\nbelieves that the veto rights conferred on the permanent \r\nfive members (P-5) are an anachronism in today’s world. \r\nrestriction or code of conduct on the use of the veto (see \r\nA/68/PV.46).\r\nWe look forward to exploring those and other issues \r\nin the negotiations we are to conduct, and we wish the \r\nPresident every success in that endeavour.\r\nMr. Donoghue (Ireland): I would like to begin \r\nby thanking Ambassador Liu Jieyi, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of China and president of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, for introducing the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/68/2).\r\nIreland warmly welcomes the initiative that \r\nthe President of the General Assembly has taken to \r\nreinvigorate the search for a fair and effective solution \r\nto the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council. \r\nWe have confidence in the advisory group that has \r\nbeen appointed, and we look forward to the fruits of \r\nthe work that it is undertaking to identify options and a \r\nbasis on which the intergovernmental negotiations can \r\nbe resumed.\r\nEveryone recognizes, and has recognized for \r\nyears, that the Security Council needs a thorough \r\noverhauling. Its composition is seriously out of step \r\nwith the geopolitical realities of today’s world. We need \r\na Security Council that is more representative, more \r\ninclusive, more effective, more transparent and more \r\naccountable in its actions. We also need to find ways \r\nthrough the logjams that its own procedures can create. \r\nThe veto rights conferred on its five permanent members \r\ncan on occasion lead to paralysis, compromising the \r\nCouncil’s ability to respond effectively to the great \r\nglobal challenges that fall within its remit.\r\nThere are many deficiencies in the Security \r\nCouncil’s structure and procedures that need to be \r\naddressed. For as long as we fail to agree a programme \r\nof significant reform, we are perpetuating a deeply \r\nunsatisfactory state of affairs. At a time when global \r\nand regional challenges are proliferating and its agenda \r\nis rapidly expanding, the Council’s weaknesses are \r\napparent and its authority and credibility are suffering.\r\nWe must make a concerted effort to move the \r\nnegotiations on reform of the Council into a more \r\nconcrete and operational phase. It is time to concentrate \r\nminds around a concise basis on which we can move \r\ntowards the decisions that are now urgently needed. It is \r\nalso important that we set ourselves a clear time frame \r\nfor that work. A high-level political meeting that would \r\ntake key decisions is something for which we should \r\n13-55456 19/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nthrough various resolutions, which calls for the start of \r\nimmediate intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Previous rounds of discussions and the \r\nbodies of proposals put forward by delegations affirm \r\nthat a clear majority of Member States support the \r\nfollowing positions, to mention but a few.\r\nFirst, the majority of Member States support an \r\nexpansion in Security Council membership in both \r\ncategories, that is, increasing the number of both \r\npermanent and non-permanent members. Secondly, \r\nthey recognize the need to eliminate the veto and \r\nimmediately implement mechanisms that limit its use \r\nas much as possible. Thirdly, they recognize the need to \r\nseriously reform the working methods of the Council in \r\norder to ensure that it works as a transparent, democratic \r\nand representative organ. Fourthly, they recognize the \r\nneed for a balanced and efficient relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nCuba is ready to begin the negotiations required \r\nfor that process without further delay, and agrees with \r\nthe majority of delegations that all the proposals made \r\nduring intergovernmental deliberations should be taken \r\ninto account. While Cuba’s positions are very well \r\nknown, allow me to reiterate them for the benefit of the \r\nnew cycle of discussions and in line with the elements \r\nof the letter of the President of the General Assembly \r\ndated 22 October.\r\nCuba does not support the creation of new \r\ncategories of membership. Instead of encouraging \r\nbetter functioning of the Council, that could exacerbate \r\nthe existing differences and foment division within the \r\nCouncil. New members of an enlarged Council, whether \r\npermanent or non-permanent, must have exactly the \r\nsame duties and powers as the current members of that \r\norgan, including the right to the veto. Cuba would not \r\nobject to the possibility of the immediate re-election of \r\nnon-permanent members.\r\nWith regard to the veto, Cuba’s view of that \r\nundemocratic and anachronistic privilege, which must, \r\nwe are firmly convinced, be eliminated, is well known. \r\nHowever, given that it would be unrealistic to expect \r\nthat to happen right now, we believe that, as a first step, \r\nthe use of the veto should be limited to actions taken \r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter.\r\nCuba favours a large increase in Security Council \r\nmembership. An enlarged Council should increase to \r\nWe would ideally wish to see them ended. If that cannot \r\nbe achieved, we see great merit in the proposal by the \r\nrepresentative of France that the P-5 would voluntarily \r\nforgo their veto rights when the Council is discussing \r\nmass atrocity crimes (see A/68/PV.46). We would hope, \r\nindeed, that the P-5 could also agree to waive those \r\nrights when dealing with other issues, such as f lagrant \r\nhuman rights violations or breaches of international \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn conclusion, a rebalanced Security Council, \r\ntogether with a modified approach to veto rights, would \r\nin our view enhance significantly the effectiveness of \r\nthe Security Council and make it fit for purpose in the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe thank the President for having convened this debate \r\nand support the efforts to launch negotioations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We also thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the People’s Republic of China \r\nfor having introduced the report on the work of the \r\nSecurity Council between 1 August 2012 and 31 July \r\n2013 (A/68/2).\r\nCuba fully associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Egypt on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (see A/68/PV.46).\r\nThe General Assembly has invested 20 years in \r\ndiscussing this issue. Those years have been crucial \r\nin terms of putting forward country positions and to \r\nfostering a better understanding of the urgency of \r\nSecurity Council reform. It is difficult to sustain the \r\nstatus quo nearly seven decades after the founding of \r\nthe United Nations with the tremendous political, social \r\nand economic development that we have seen in the \r\nhistory of humankind during this period, in particular \r\nin the past 20 years.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nCuba reiterates the need to launch true negotiations \r\non Security Council reform that would make that main \r\norgan of the United Nations a democratic, transparent \r\nand representative body. The 193 States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations would in that way feel fully represented \r\nand recognize the full legitimacy of the provision of \r\nArticle 24 of the Charter, which confers on the Council \r\nthe responsibility of acting on behalf of all Member \r\nStates.\r\nAs Member States, we must also comply with \r\nthe mandate established by the General Assembly \r\n20/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\ncontribution of Member States to the Organization \r\nshould be taken into account in considering \r\nmodifications of the Security Council’s composition. \r\nIn that regard, fulfilment of financial obligations and \r\nparticipation in peacekeeping operations are of the \r\nutmost importance. Reform is essential, but it should be \r\ndone without weakening the efficiency of the Council.\r\nFurthermore, the enlargement of the Council \r\nshould seek to ensure a balanced representation of all \r\nregional groups. In that context, Poland supports a \r\nreform that would grant an additional non-permanent \r\nseat to the East European States, given the Group’s \r\nsubstantial enlargement in recent decades — from 9 to \r\n23 countries.\r\nWe have always supported efforts to improve the \r\nworking methods of the Security Council with a view \r\nto making its actions more transparent. The Security \r\nCouncil should further enhance its cooperation with \r\nregional organizations, troop-contributing countries, \r\nthe Secretariat and the entire United Nations system. We \r\nsupport more active engagement by non-Member States \r\nand countries directly affected by conflict situations in \r\nthe work of the Security Council, in particular during \r\nthe process of preparing resolutions, presidential \r\nstatements and press statements. Genuine improvement \r\nin the functioning of the Security Council should also \r\ninclude closer consultation with civil society. We hope \r\nthat the newly established accountability, coherence \r\nand transparency group will contribute significantly to \r\nthe discussion on the working methods of the Council.\r\nWe take note of the recent decision of the President \r\nof the General Assembly, Ambassador John Ashe, to \r\nestablish his advisory group on Security Council reform \r\nand to organize this year’s debate on this issue earlier \r\nthan usual. We believe that such steps may help to build \r\nmomentum for an acceleration of the negotiations. \r\nHowever, while new attempts to revitalize the debate \r\nare of the utmost importance, it is equally important to \r\navoid harmful polarization of positions.\r\nMrs. Miculescu (Romania): As we are jointly \r\ndebating two agenda items, I would like first to use \r\nthis opportunity to thank the President of the Security \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Liu Jieyi, for introducing the \r\nSecurity Council’s annual report (A/68/2), as well \r\nas the United States for preparing its introduction. I \r\nalso thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this timely and very useful debate.\r\n25 or 26 members. The expansion should take place \r\nin both categories of membership and most of the new \r\nseats should go to developing countries, on the basis \r\nof the proposals made by the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\nThe objective is not to expand for the sake of expansion, \r\nbut rather to respond to the unjustifiable lack of \r\nrepresentation of developing countries in the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nCouncil reform must also include the reform of its \r\nworking methods. We support a transparent Security \r\nCouncil in which closed-door consultations are the \r\nexception and not the rule. We aspire to a Council \r\nthat addresses the issues that it is responsible for, \r\nwhich means that the Council must not encroach on \r\nthe mandates of other organs. We want a Council that \r\nreally considers Member States’ views before adopting \r\ndecisions, and that ensures a level of real access to \r\nStates that are not members of that body.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Cuba’s opinion that \r\nSecurity Council reform is a central element of the \r\nreform of the United Nations. One cannot speak of \r\ngenuine reform of the Organization until there is real \r\nreform of the Council so that it functions on behalf of \r\nthe interests of all Member States, which, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter, is what it is supposed to do. It should \r\nbe held accountable for that.\r\nMr. Sarkowicz (Poland): This year’s general debate \r\nproved that the issue of an effective and responsive \r\nSecurity Council is one of the major concerns of \r\nthe whole membership. The President of Poland, \r\nMr. Bronisław Komorowski, voiced in his statement \r\n(see A/68/PV.9) Poland’s strong support for bolstering \r\nthe Council’s authority, legitimacy and effectiveness. \r\nWe believe that the appropriate moment has come for \r\nbreaking the deadlock in the reform process.\r\nPoland views the enhancement of the efficiency \r\nand transparency of the Council’s work, as well as its \r\nenlargement, as the key issues in the complex process \r\nof reforming the Security Council. The reform should \r\nbe built on the assumption that membership not only \r\ngrants privileges but also, most important, increases \r\nresponsibilities. All Security Council members are \r\nentrusted with an extremely important duty to defend \r\nand secure the fundamental values inscribed in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nSecurity Council reform is essential, as the current \r\ncomposition of the Council and its working methods \r\ndo not meet the challenges of the world today. The \r\n13-55456 21/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nWe should be realistically ambitious. That is why, \r\nin our view, the five key issues under consideration \r\nshould be approached independently, at their own \r\npace. Among them, the further improvement of the \r\nSecurity Council’s working methods is definitely the \r\nleast contentious one and continues to offer some \r\nchance for further progress. In that respect, Romania \r\nfinds particularly interesting the various concrete \r\nproposals that have been made, particularly the recent \r\nones introduced by the accountability, coherence and \r\ntransparency group. \r\nIn most of the national statements on Security \r\nCouncil reform in particular, and on reform of the \r\nUnited Nations system more broadly, 2015 is the \r\ndeadline for bringing in deliverables. Romania is \r\nnaturally of the view that we are lagging far behind \r\nthe commitments undertaken by our Heads of State \r\nand Government at the 2005 World Summit to make \r\nthe Council, which is a unique body, more broadly \r\nrepresentative, efficient and transparent, and thus to \r\nfurther enhance its effectiveness and legitimacy and \r\nto facilitate the implementation of its decisions. We \r\ntherefore believe that we are at a juncture where time is \r\ncritical for consensual and collective decisions. \r\nThe President of the General Assembly has rightly \r\nanticipated that our current debates represent yet \r\nanother opportunity for Member States to reiterate \r\nnational positions on Security Council reform. Please \r\nallow me therefore to briefly state Romania’s main \r\nobjectives in that process. \r\nWe stand firmly for increased representation of \r\nthe East European Group and for providing for at least \r\none additional non-permanent seat for the Group in the \r\nfuture architecture of the Security Council. We support \r\nan expansion of the Council in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent categories, within reasonable \r\nlimits — that is, up to 25 members. We consider that \r\nan adjustment of the veto right should be based on the \r\nconsensus of the current permanent members, while \r\ntaking into consideration the needs of the Council for \r\nfaster action, greater involvement in conflict prevention \r\nand increased efficiency. We fully agree with the \r\nAfrican, Asian, and Latin American Groups’ proposals \r\nfor better representation in the Security Council. \r\nAt the same time, the President of the General \r\nAssembly invited us to take this opportunity to identify \r\nthe directions in which the search for common ground \r\nmight be undertaken. That is why I would like to state \r\nAllow me to put on record, at the very outset, my \r\ndelegation’s support for the efforts of the President \r\nof the General Assembly aimed at relaunching the \r\nconsultation process on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We are very pleased with his decision to \r\nreappoint the Permanent Representative of Afghanistan, \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Zahir Tanin, as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, and we warmly \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Tanin. His reappointment \r\nensures the continuity and the necessary institutional \r\nmemory of the work in progress and reflects a \r\nrecognition of and trust in the skills, dedication, \r\npatience and impartiality that Ambassador Tanin has \r\ndemonstrated during the last couple of years. \r\nWe also value the initiative of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly to establish an advisory group \r\nfor facilitating the start of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the current session. We hope that the \r\ngroup will cooperate fully with Ambassador Tanin so \r\nthat the process can advance effectively. I avail myself \r\nof this opportunity to congratulate all the colleagues \r\ninvolved in this new stage of the process and assure \r\nthem of my delegation’s full interest and readiness \r\nto contribute to the progress of the work during the \r\ncurrent session. We fully appreciate and value the \r\nextensive details on the rationale and the exact mandate \r\nof the group that the President of the General Assembly \r\nprovided us with at the opening of our debate.\r\nAs we also seek to adopt feasible concrete measures \r\nfor Security Council reform before the 2015 summit, \r\nwe are in favour of accelerating the deliberations, \r\nincluding with the input received from the advisory \r\ngroup. The time has come to start negotiations on a \r\nconcise draft text.\r\nWe got a glimpse of what lies ahead of us in \r\nthe next stage during the latest Security Council \r\nopen debate on the Council’s working methods (see \r\nS/PV.7052), where there was broad recognition of the \r\nimprovements — although some speakers considered \r\nthem to be slow and tortured. Nevertheless, in terms \r\nof transparency and accountability, some progress \r\nhas been achieved through, inter alia, open debates, \r\nbriefings by the President for non-member States, \r\nwrap-up and horizon-scanning meetings and through \r\nimproved public access to information. Now that all \r\nof those improvements have been launched, we need \r\nto maintain them so that they become the rule, not the \r\nexception. \r\n22/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nis able to carry out its primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIndeed, there has been too much talk about the need \r\nfor reform with too little action. We therefore welcome \r\nMr. John Ashe’s commitment to prioritizing the matter \r\nduring his term as President of the General Assembly. \r\nWe extend our full support to the President and his \r\nleadership in order to infuse the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating process with a sense of urgency and much-\r\nneeded momentum. In his acceptance speech upon \r\nhis election, on 14 June, as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session (see A/67/PV.87), \r\nhe made a pledge to advance the process of reforming \r\nall of the principal organs of the United Nations. We \r\nnow recognize that pledge to have been inspired by the \r\ncommitments made at the 2005 World Summit. \r\nWhile the reform agenda covers the full spectrum \r\nof global governance, it has become necessary, for \r\nthe reasons mentioned, for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil to be addressed as a matter of priority. We \r\napplaud the leadership that the President of the General \r\nAssembly is showing on that important matter. South \r\nAfrica views the reform of the Security Council as \r\na key link in the restructuring of the United Nations \r\naimed at ensuring that it is adequately empowered to \r\naddress current and future challenges that require our \r\ncollective action through the multilateral system of \r\ngovernance, as mandated by our leaders at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. It is therefore imperative that we move \r\nwith the same sense of resolve and urgency to reform \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nWe are all aware that for many years the open-\r\nended dialogue on Security Council reform has not \r\nproduced much in terms of tangible outcomes. It is \r\ntherefore incumbent upon us, under the leadership of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, to infuse the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process with renewed \r\nvigour. It is high time that we progress to text-based \r\nnegotiations, an approach that has been a tried-and-\r\ntested tool in the United Nations as the means to get us \r\nto where we need to go. In our view, a call for anything \r\nless is to advocate for the United Nations to remain stuck \r\nin a bygone era, while the challenges to maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security outpace the ability of \r\nthe United Nations to respond effectively. We therefore \r\nsupport any initiative to move the stalled process to a \r\nconcrete result, and we trust that the advisory group \r\nappointed by the President of the General Assembly \r\nwill rise to the task. \r\nonce more the strong preference of my country to engage \r\nin a truly intergovernmental negotiating process that is \r\nbased on a concise document. We look forward to the \r\ninput of the advisory group and to the 15 November \r\nmeeting under the leadership of Ambassador Tanin. \r\nRomania sincerely hopes that we are entering a new \r\nstage of the process that will be characterized by \r\ninclusiveness, transparency, predictability and stronger \r\npolitical will, a stage that will integrate all the valuable \r\nideas put forward so far as well as those that will \r\ndefinitely continue to emerge.\r\nMr. Mashabane (South Africa): At the outset, we \r\nwould like to align ourselves with the statements made \r\non behalf of the African Group and the L.69 Group (see \r\nA/68/PV.46).\r\nWhen the President of the Republic of South Africa, \r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, addressed the General Assembly on \r\n24 September 2013, he said the following about the \r\nreform of the Security Council: \r\n“Allow me, therefore, to register once again \r\nour serious concern that the Security Council, \r\nalmost 70 years since its establishment, remains \r\nundemocratic, unrepresentative and unfair \r\nto developing nations and small States, and \r\ndisenfranchises the majority of the States Members \r\nof the United Nations, which form the majority in \r\nthe General Assembly. We cannot remain beholden \r\nindefinitely to the will of an unrepresentative \r\nminority on the most important issues of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n“There has been too much talk about the \r\nneed for reform, with too little action. We would \r\nlike to challenge the Assembly today by saying \r\n‘Let us set ourselves the target to celebrate the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations in \r\n2015 with a reformed, more inclusive, democratic \r\nand representative Security Council!’” (A/68/PV.5, \r\np. 50).\r\nWe are pleased that a number of Member States are \r\ntaking up that challenge and that more and more voices \r\nare joining in the call to achieve the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in time for the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Organization in 2015. The need for the reform of \r\nthe Security Council has been made even more urgent \r\nby the Council’s inability to effectively address current \r\nand continuing crisis situations, and calls into question \r\nwhether the Council, as it is currently constituted, \r\n13-55456 23/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nThe reality is that those who are opposed to the call for \r\na comprehensive review and reform know very well that \r\nthey are in the minority and that they are on the wrong \r\nside of history. They continue to use all the tricks in the \r\nbook to delay and frustrate the process with a view to \r\nparalysing it.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa believes that the time \r\nto engage in text-based negotiation is now. That can \r\nhappen only if all those who would like to see an early \r\nreform unite and support the facilitator, Ambassador \r\nTanin. The meeting of 15 November cannot be yet \r\nanother debate filled with rhetoric, but should be \r\nabout the text that is intended to serve as a base for the \r\nnegotiations. By now we know one another’s positions \r\non reform. What we need now is for those positions \r\nto be packaged, just as the facilitator did when he \r\nproduced his third draft text. A failure of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt a framework resolution in 2015 risks \r\nrendering the Security Council irrelevant, illegitimate \r\nand unaccountable.\r\nFinally, we have noted that most Member \r\nStates support the legitimate claim of Africans for \r\nrepresentation in the permanent category. However, \r\nwe are concerned that such claims of support have not \r\nbeen translated into concrete actions of support for \r\nearly reform. It is far-fetched to think that reform is \r\nonly for the benefit of Africa. Therefore, expressions \r\nof support should be located within the broad context \r\nof comprehensive reform; otherwise, such support is \r\nmeaningless.\r\nMs. Lalić Smajević (Serbia): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank the President for convening this meeting to \r\ndiscuss one of the most important issues on the agenda \r\nof the United Nations, and we wish therefore to express \r\nour appreciation for his commitment to drive the \r\nprocess forward. We would like to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate the representative of Afghanistan on \r\nhis reappointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council. We \r\nwould also like to join previous speakers in thanking \r\nChina for introducing the Security Council’s annual \r\nreport (A/68/2) to the General Assembly, and the United \r\nStates of America for preparing its introduction.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to point out that \r\nthe Republic of Serbia is firmly committed to \r\nmultilateralism in international relations and is a strong \r\nbeliever in the crucial and irreplaceable role of the \r\nUnited Nations in safeguarding international peace and \r\nOur preference is for text-based negotiations to start \r\non 15 November. We see that as a realistic approach \r\nthat can add momentum to the process of reform in an \r\ninclusive and transparent manner. The draft text must \r\nreflect the aspirations of the overwhelming majority \r\nof the membership of the United Nations, which has \r\nbeen calling for early reform, and should include an \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership.\r\nWe are fast approaching the year 2015, which will \r\nbe the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nand which will also be the culmination of the decade \r\nfollowing the 2005 World Summit, when our Heads of \r\nState and Government mandated us to achieve early \r\nreform of the Security Council. My delegation believes \r\nthat it is within our reach to deliver a reformed Security \r\nCouncil in time to celebrate that milestone occasion. \r\nThe world has changed since 1945, and the membership \r\nof the United Nations has quadrupled since then. The \r\nonly organ that has remained the same for the past seven \r\ndecades is the Security Council, and that is untenable. \r\nIt is an irony that those who consider themselves the \r\nleaders of the free world and the bastions of democracy \r\nare themselves comfortable sitting in an undemocratic, \r\narchaic and unrepresentative structure.\r\nThe more we continue with rhetoric and do not get \r\ndown to the business of negotiating actual reform, the \r\nstatus quo continues to favour those who are privileged \r\nby the post-Second World War settlement. Africans are \r\nnot going to accept the view that we should maintain \r\nthe status quo while 70 per cent of the workload of the \r\nSecurity Council deals with African issues. Therefore, \r\nwe would like to call on all progressive forces and \r\nlike-minded countries to begin to consider producing \r\na framework text covering all five agreed areas. Such a \r\nframework text would draw inspiration from the third \r\nrevised draft that the facilitator produced some months \r\nago. Based on the statements that have been made since \r\nthe beginning of the intergovernmental negotiations by \r\nMember States and the observations of the facilitator \r\na year and a half ago, it is clear that the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the States Members of the United Nations \r\nwould like to see a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council with an expansion in both categories \r\nof membership.\r\nWe would like to make one point clear. The Charter \r\nis very unambiguous on the numbers required to amend \r\nit, and we therefore would not want to be drawn into a \r\nview that reform can be achieved only by consensus. \r\n24/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nconsensus on the part of Member States. At the same \r\ntime, it should ensure the proper representation in \r\nthat body of Member States from the various regional \r\ngroups. In that context, we would appreciate it if the \r\npossibility of creating yet another seat for the East \r\nEuropean Group could be seriously discussed during \r\nthe next stage of Security Council reform negotiations, \r\nin view of the fact that the number of countries in that \r\nregion has increased.\r\nIt is essential to maintain the trust and confidence \r\nof the entire membership in the process so that it \r\ncan continue in a constructive manner. Success in \r\nachieving a comprehensive reform of the Organization \r\nthat takes into account the interests of all Member \r\nStates while encompassing the five key issues set \r\nout in decision 62/557 will require greater f lexibility, \r\nmutual understanding and the political daring to reach \r\na compromise.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate our hope that \r\nwe shall find the courage and wisdom to take the \r\nnegotiations to the next stage in the period ahead. That \r\nwould further enhance the General Assembly’s status as \r\na centre for harmonizing the actions of nations and, in \r\nthat way, advance the efforts of generations to entrench \r\npeace, security and prosperity across the globe.\r\nThe Republic of Serbia will continue to engage \r\nconstructively and to cooperate closely with other \r\nMember States in advancing the main objectives of \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nMrs. Namgyel (Bhutan): My delegation is pleased \r\nto participate in the discussions under the important \r\nagenda item 123, entitled “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. In doing \r\nso, my delegation fully associates itself with the \r\nviews expressed by the Permanent Representative of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis on behalf of the L.69 group (see \r\nA/68/PV.46).\r\nMy delegation is pleased to note that a matter \r\nof great urgency is receiving the requisite attention \r\nunder the able leadership of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In that connection, we welcome the \r\nreappointment of Ambassador Tanin as the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. My delegation would \r\nlike to wish him every success in taking the process \r\nforward and to assure him of our full cooperation.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations under the \r\nChairmanship of Ambassador Tanin has made \r\nsecurity and in promoting universal democratic values, \r\nhuman rights and development.\r\nMy country is a strong advocate for a reform and \r\nrevitalization of the United Nations system that aims to \r\nadjust it to contemporary circumstances and streamline \r\nit to make it more realistically reflect the political and \r\neconomic relations of the twenty-first century. The \r\ndriving force and political framework for that process \r\nwas provided by world leaders at the 2005 World \r\nSummit, whose Outcome described early reform of the \r\nCouncil as\r\n“an essential element of our overall efforts to reform \r\nthe United Nations ... in order to make [it] more \r\nbroadly representative, efficient and transparent \r\nand thus to further enhance its effectiveness and \r\nthe legitimacy and implementation of its decisions.” \r\n(resolution 60/1, para. 153)\r\nBearing that in mind, let me recall that, more than \r\nfive years ago, in 2008, the current negotiating process \r\nwas established by decision 62/557, which the General \r\nAssembly adopted by consensus. It has since provided \r\nMember States with a platform for discussing the future \r\nof the Security Council. Meanwhile, the rapidity of the \r\nchanges taking place outside these walls is increasingly \r\noutpacing the tempo of reforms that we are able to \r\nagree upon. It is therefore important to speed up the \r\ncurrent process of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nduring this session in accordance with decision 67/561, \r\nof 29 August.\r\nIn order to accelerate that process, we must invest \r\nour best efforts in an effort to find a compromise solution \r\nand establish a joint platform that is acceptable to the \r\nmajority of the Organization. In future negotiations, we \r\nshould proceed from the fact that the membership is \r\nunited in the conviction that Security Council reform \r\nis necessary, in line with the conclusions of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. Additional efforts should be made to \r\novercome the existing differences and ensure even \r\ngreater convergence on all the aspects of the reform, as \r\nwell as on all available models and proposals by Member \r\nStates. We believe that the sensitive and complex nature \r\nof the issue should not deter us from working hard, with \r\nmutual respect, in an open, inclusive and transparent \r\nmanner. In that context, the Republic of Serbia will \r\nsupport every country working towards a reform that \r\nrealistically reflects the situation at the global level.\r\nWe believe that an enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil should be based on the broadest possible \r\n13-55456 25/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nGuinea on behalf of the small island developing States \r\nof the Pacific.\r\nA reform of the Council remains an essential and \r\nintegral element of our overall effort to reform the \r\nmultilateral system. It has, however, eluded us for the \r\npast 15 years in the Open-ended Working Group on the \r\nQuestion of Equitable Representation on and Increase \r\nin the Membership of the Security Council and Other \r\nMatters Related to the Security Council, before entering \r\nintergovernmental negotiations for the past five years. \r\nA wealth of ideas have been collated over the years.\r\nIn that connection, Solomon Islands registers \r\nits appreciation to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for taking a fresh look at where we are in \r\nthe negotiations. My delegation shares the appreciation \r\nof those who have spoken before me in welcoming the \r\nreappointment of His Excellency Ambassador Tanin to \r\nmanage our intergovernmental negotiations process. \r\nHe has been with us from the beginning. Once again, as \r\nalways, my delegation takes this opportunity to assure \r\nAmbassador Tanin of Solomon Islands’ support and \r\ncooperation going forward.\r\nThe work of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess is guided by the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 60/1), the \r\nrelevant rules of procedure and past practice. Decision \r\n62/557 identifies the five key negotiable elements. We \r\ncertainly have a document that compiles all of our \r\npositions; it now needs to be streamlined for it to be a \r\nnegotiable text.\r\nMy delegation would like to acknowledge the \r\nPresident’s hands-on approach in initiating the \r\nestablishment of an advisory group of ambassadors to \r\nassist his Office. That initiative will breathe life into \r\nour stale intergovernmental negotiations process. We \r\ncongratulate the ambassadors on their appointment \r\nand look forward to working with them. We would like \r\nthem to produce a streamlined negotiating text based \r\non submissions made by the membership. Once that is \r\ndone, it will bring all our thoughts together in a single \r\ntext that allows us to take collective action on negotiable \r\nelements that already enjoy general consensus. The \r\noutput of their work should remain State-driven and \r\nshould feed into the resumed intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We are clear about the fact that we are not \r\ncreating another negotiating track.\r\nWe live and operate in a fast-changing world. \r\nAlready, we have seen deep integration within some \r\ncommendable progress, and it is now imperative that \r\nthe process move forward on the basis of a text-based \r\nnegotiations. Towards that end, we welcome the timely \r\ninitiative of the President to convene an advisory group \r\nto assist him and to provide input to facilitate the work \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations without further \r\ndelay. If the advisory group is to begin its work on an \r\nauspicious track, it must include in its draft the desire \r\nof an overwhelming majority of the States Members \r\nof the United Nations for an early reform, which, inter \r\nalia, includes an expansion in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories of membership.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is compelling \r\nand has been called for by world leaders and \r\nrepresentatives of almost every nation, both outside \r\nand within this Hall — testimony of the unanimous \r\nconviction of the overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates that it is high time for change. By now, the \r\npositions of each group, perhaps even each Member \r\nState, have been well articulated during the last eight \r\nrounds of the intergovernmental negotiations. Reform \r\nefforts must be expedited, taking into account the most \r\naccommodative, inclusive and judicious of those views \r\nif the United Nations is to adapt to the transformed \r\nrealities and to continue to retain its relevance and \r\ncredibility.\r\nThe United Nations will be 70 years old in 2015. We \r\nwill also be marking the end of a decade since Heads \r\nof State and Governments mandated us to achieve \r\nearly reform of the Security Council at the 2005 World \r\nSummit. Surely, we cannot and must not fail to deliver \r\nconcrete outcomes for such a historic timeline.\r\nBefore concluding, may I also join other delegations \r\nin placing on record our appreciation to His Excellency \r\nthe Permanent Representative of China for the \r\ncomprehensive annual report on the work of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/68/2), as well as to the delegation of the \r\nUnited States for preparing the report’s introduction.\r\nMrs. Beck (Solomon Islands): Let me thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening \r\nthis plenary meeting on agenda item 123, concerning \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nThe Solomon Islands would like to align its \r\nstatement with that made by the representative of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis on behalf of the L.69 group (see \r\nA/68/PV.46), as well as with the statement to be made \r\nthis afternoon by the representative of Papua New \r\n26/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nOn the relationship between the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council, we would like to see it \r\nimprove. My delegation acknowledges that the Council’s \r\nannual report to the General Assembly strengthens the \r\nrelationship between the two organs. We thank the \r\nChinese delegation for its introduction of the report \r\n(A/68/2) yesterday (see A/68/PV.46).\r\nFinally, I conclude by stating that we need a \r\nreformed Security Council to match the realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Solomon Islands, like all of the \r\nPacific States, stands ready to engage in reforming the \r\nCouncil. We hope to see progress in the negotiations \r\ncarried out in good faith, with mutual respect and in an \r\nopen, inclusive and transparent manner.\r\nMs. Philippa Jane King (Australia): First, let me \r\nthank you, Madam President, for presiding over this \r\njoint debate on the Security Council annual report \r\n(A/68/2) and Security Council reform — a subject on \r\nwhich Australia is a long-standing advocate. Australia \r\nwelcomes the introduction of the Security Council \r\nannual report, made by the Permanent Representative \r\nof China, Ambassador Liu Jieyi, in his capacity as \r\nPresident of the Council for this month. We also \r\nthank the United States delegation, along with other \r\nCouncil members, for their work on the report. We look \r\nforward to a more substantive discussion in the General \r\nAssembly on the annual report later this month.\r\nSubstantive reform of the Security Council is long \r\noverdue. It is therefore imperative that we achieve \r\nprogress in the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform during the sixty-eighth session \r\nof the General Assembly. Indeed, the priority that the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly has attached to the \r\nissue during his presidency is welcome and significant. \r\nWe commend his reappointment of Afghanistan’s \r\nAmbassador Tanin as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Having led the General Assembly’s work \r\non the issue consistently since 2008, Ambassador \r\nTanin’s reappointment will be an important element in \r\nmaintaining continuity, focus and an appreciation of \r\nthe complexities of the issues under discussion.\r\nWe also welcome the appointment by the President \r\nof the General Assembly of a new advisory group on \r\nSecurity Council reform, composed of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Belgium, Brazil, Liechtenstein, \r\nPapua New Guinea, San Marino and Sierra Leone. \r\nWe have full confidence in the substantial intellectual \r\ncontribution and integrity of those individuals and \r\nthe group. Given the need for a strong Council with \r\nregions of the Organization that have already developed \r\na common foreign policy. That needs to be taken into \r\nconsideration in any reform outcome. We must also \r\navoid going into the negotiations with conditions that \r\nput the process in a straitjacket. We call on everyone \r\nto come to the table with a vision to strengthen the \r\nCouncil’s role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and to ensure that structural change in the \r\nCouncil happens.\r\nI will now go through the Solomon Islands’ position \r\non the five Security Council reform elements as they \r\nhave been stated or restated over the years — the \r\nquestions of the veto, regional representation, the size \r\nof an enlarged Council, the relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, and the Council’s \r\nworking methods.\r\nOf the five negotiable elements, we see improving \r\nthe working methods of the Security Council as the \r\nlow-hanging fruit that does not warrant change to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and that already has the \r\nwidest possible support of everyone.\r\nI will be bold and suggest that the President may \r\nwish to consider drafting a resolution on improving \r\nthe working methods of the Security Council that \r\naddresses the legitimacy, inclusiveness, representation \r\nand transparency of the Council. We can build on \r\nwork already done by the group of five small nations. \r\nWe acknowledge the work done by the Council itself \r\non improving its working methods. The Council’s \r\nefforts complement the work to be done by the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nOn the question of the veto, we would like to see it \r\nabolished. But in the event that it is retained, the rights \r\nand privileges of the veto must be accorded to all new \r\nmembers to ensure that everyone with a permanent seat \r\nis on equal footing. The use of the veto is also linked to \r\nimproved working methods that provide for limitations \r\non the use of the veto.\r\nOn enlargement in the number of permanent \r\nand non-permanent seats, Solomon Islands supports \r\nenlargement in both categories. We would also like \r\nto see a seat for small island developing States in the \r\nnon-permanent category.\r\nWith respect to equitable regional and geographical \r\nrepresentation in terms of the permanent seats, special \r\nattention must be focused on unrepresented or under-\r\nrepresented regions.\r\n13-55456 27/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\npolice-contributing countries — those countries that \r\nare actually working to implement Council mandates \r\non the ground, as well as key organs of the United \r\nNations, such as the Peacebuilding Commission and \r\nregional and subregional organizations.\r\nAs we said during the Security Council open debate \r\non working methods held on 29 October (see S/PV.7053), \r\nthe accountability, coherence and transparency group, \r\nestablished in May, has greatly informed our work as a \r\nCouncil member, and we value our collaboration with \r\nthe members of the group.\r\nThe notes by the President of the Council of \r\n28 August (S/2013/515) and 28 October (S/2013/630) \r\nrepresent important steps towards enhancing the \r\nCouncil’s engagement with the wider membership, \r\nincluding troop- and police-contributing countries.\r\nAs the President of the General Assembly has said, \r\nMember States must now consider how to reinvigorate \r\ntheir efforts in order to find common ground on \r\nthe issue. Today and yesterday have seen useful \r\ndiscussions. But now let us try to make substantive \r\nprogress. My delegation looks forward to hearing the \r\nideas of the membership as well as the ideas of the \r\nadvisory group on how to take the issue forward. It will \r\nrequire f lexibility, cooperation, creative solutions and, \r\nabove all else, some political will. But we must make \r\nprogress to strengthen and modernize the Council. The \r\nchallenges that face it and that face all of us are great \r\nand growing, and we need to remake a body that will \r\nmeet them.\r\nMr. Reetoo (Mauritius): Mauritius aligns itself with \r\nthe statement on Security Council reform delivered by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\non behalf of the L.69 group (see A/68/PV.46).\r\nThe debate over Security Council reform \r\nhas endured for far too long. World leaders at the \r\nMillennium Summit resolved to intensify efforts \r\nto achieve a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in all its aspects. At the 2005 World Summit, \r\nour leaders supported the early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil as an essential element of the overall reform of \r\nthe United Nations in order to make the Council more \r\nbroadly representative, efficient and transparent, and \r\nthus further enhance its effectiveness, legitimacy and \r\nthe implementation of its decisions.\r\nMauritius is convinced of the need for a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations that \r\nupholds the principles, objectives and ideals of the \r\nthe capacity to tackle today’s international peace and \r\nsecurity challenges, we support that initiative. We have \r\na rare opportunity to achieve lasting successful reform, \r\nand we should seize it. We need to shift the mindset \r\nfrom posturing to practical, real negotiations.\r\nAustralia has long supported an expansion of \r\nthe Council’s membership in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. That is important both to \r\nensure a more equitable geographic balance and to \r\nenhance the Council’s legitimacy. Both of those factors \r\nare important drivers of reform. As we have said \r\nbefore, all Member States have a stake in the Council’s \r\ndecisions. The Council has universal responsibilities \r\nand engages in situations across regions, particularly in \r\nAfrica, for which the case for permanent membership is \r\nclear and compelling.\r\nSince joining the United Nations as a founding \r\nMember, Australia has also argued strenuously for \r\nlimits on the use of the veto, and promoted transparency \r\nas integral to the Security Council’s legitimacy. \r\nWe remain strongly committed to those principles, \r\nparticularly as an elected Security Council member for \r\nthis year and next.\r\nThe growing complexity and breadth of the \r\nCouncil’s agenda makes it all the more necessary \r\nfor the Council to adapt to modern times. The key to \r\neffectiveness lies in a more representative, transparent \r\nand legitimate Security Council.\r\nA major criticism of the Council is that in recent \r\ntimes, in the face of major humanitarian crises, it \r\nhas failed to discharge its responsibility to maintain \r\npeace and security — a responsibility it exercises on \r\nbehalf of all Member States. Much criticism is directed \r\ntowards the impact of the use or the threat of use of the \r\nveto. Given the recent Syrian experience, we believe \r\nFrance’s proposal for permanent members to voluntarily \r\nrenounce their veto powers in cases of mass atrocity \r\ncrimes has merit and deserves further consideration. \r\nWe should seriously discuss how to take that proposal \r\nforward.\r\nWithout prejudice to other aspects of Council reform, \r\nAustralia supports early efforts to realize immediate \r\nand tangible benefits in the Council’s working methods. \r\nAs an elected member of the Council, we have seen \r\nfirst-hand the importance of and the need for greater \r\ntransparency and accountability in the Council’s work, \r\nincluding to enhance engagement with the broader \r\nUnited Nations membership, in particular troop- and \r\n28/29 13-55456\r\nA/68/PV.48 08/11/2013\r\nThe Security Council is the principal organ of the \r\nUnited Nations with the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nMany factors determine the effectiveness of the \r\nSecurity Council and the authority that it carries in the \r\ninternational community. Most important is the quality \r\nof the decisions and the political and practical ability \r\nto carry them out. We are concerned that the ability of \r\nthe Security Council to take the necessary decisions is \r\ntoo often compromised due to the right of the veto of \r\npermanent members. The Security Council must show \r\nthat atrocity crimes are not tolerated by the international \r\ncommunity. We join other Members in asking that the \r\npermanent members of the Council refrain from the use \r\nof veto in such cases.\r\nI think that we all agree that the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council is crucial. The composition and \r\nthe working methods play a key role in the reform. \r\nTransparency, openness and inclusiveness are \r\nrelevant concepts in improving the functioning of the \r\nSecurity Council. We are proud to be members of the \r\naccountability, coherence and transparency group, \r\nwhose purpose is to develop and improve the working \r\nmethods of the Council. The composition of the future \r\nSecurity Council is, of course, the main issue. Efforts \r\nto improve the working methods are not a substitute \r\nfor increasing the representativeness of the Council. In \r\nview of the realities of today’s world, an enlargement \r\nof the Security Council is necessary in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories, but \r\nwithout extending the right of the veto.\r\nThe Security Council needs large and small \r\ncountries. Even the smallest countries can make a \r\nvaluable contribution to the work of the Council in the \r\nbenefit of international peace and security, However, \r\nsize is not everything. We need better geographic \r\nrepresention. The underrepresentation of Africa is a key \r\nissue to address and to resolve in the reform process.\r\nFinally, let me underline that Finland wholeheatedly \r\nsupports Security Council reform. We hope that all \r\nMembers of the United Nations will have an open mind \r\nand be ready to discuss new ideas. That process can \r\nsucceed only if we focus on possible solutions, not on \r\ndisagreements. Finland remains committed to engaging \r\nactively and constructively in order to advance the \r\nreform. We look forward to making tangible progress \r\nunder the guidance of the President of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nCharter of the United Nations. We believe that the \r\nreform should promote greater equity and take into \r\nconsideration the major political and economic changes \r\nthat the world has witnessed since the inception of the \r\nOrganization. Mauritius also considers that the time \r\nhas come for text-based negotiations to take place \r\nwithin the intergovernmental process.\r\nWe welcome the reappointment of His Excellency \r\nMr. Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and wish him success in steering the process \r\nforward. We also support the initiative of the President \r\nof the General Assembly to appoint an advisory group \r\nto assist him in that important process during the sixty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nMauritius supports the L.69 proposal because we \r\nbelieve that it is consistent with the African common \r\nposition, as embodied in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration. We believe in Africa’s rightful \r\naspiration to enhanced representation in the Security \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories. We also subscribe to the view that, as long \r\nas permanent members of the Security Council have the \r\nright of veto, the new permanent members of a reformed \r\nSecurity Council, too, should have the right of veto. We \r\nalso fully support the proposal that the expansion of the \r\nSecurity Council should include one non-permanent \r\nseat for small island developing States.\r\nAfter debates spanning more than two decades, \r\nthe international community should start real and \r\nmeaningful negotiations on Security Council reform. \r\nMauritius believes that the celebration of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations, in the year 2015, will \r\nbe an important turning point, at which we should be \r\nable to deliver concrete outcomes on this most pressing \r\nsubject. We hope that this session of the General \r\nAssembly, under the able leadership of the President, \r\nwill generate the necessary political will and collective \r\neffort to take the process forward.\r\nMr. Viinanen (Finland): Allow me to commend \r\nHis Excellency Mr. John Ashe, President of the General \r\nAssembly, for convening this meeting on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council. We thank the \r\nPresident for his commitment to achieving progress \r\non that important topic. We firmly believe that, under \r\nhis able leadership, it is possible to move forward and \r\nachieve concrete results in that protracted process.\r\n13-55456 29/29\r\n08/11/2013 A/68/PV.48\r\nof the General Assembly for his reappointment of \r\nAmbassador Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process on Security Council reform. We \r\nlikewise welcome the establishment of the advisory \r\ngroup to facilitate the continuation of the negotiations \r\nprocess and note its composition of Member States \r\nfrom a wide cross-section representing the different \r\npositions. Such developments have provided us with a \r\nnew opportunity to move the process forward on the \r\nbasis of text-based negotiations.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our continued support for an \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership of the Security Council. We \r\nbelieve that the new permanent members should include \r\ncountries from Africa, Asia and Latin America, and that \r\nthe new non-permanent members should be from Asia, \r\nEastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean and \r\nAfrica. That takes into account the need to ensure the \r\nrepresentation of developing countries, including small \r\nisland developing States, whose participation should be \r\non the basis of the concept of rotating seats.\r\nWith regard to the working methods of the Council, \r\nwe are supportive of the view that there should be an \r\nimprovement in those methods and in the relationship \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly. Jamaica believes that appropriate measures \r\nmust be adopted to enable the General Assembly to \r\nfunction effectively as the chief deliberative, policy-\r\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, Jamaica remains convinced that Security \r\nCouncil reform is an important element in ensuring \r\neffective global governance. The United Nations must \r\nnot only be a forum for discussion of global issues but \r\nmust demonstrate leadership and be an example of \r\nthat. A failure to achieve concrete outcomes on such \r\na pressing subject would be tantamount to a failure to \r\nbuild and sustain peace for a safer world for this and \r\nfuture generations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): Jamaica associates \r\nitself with the statements made by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Kitts and Nevis representing \r\nthe L.69 group and by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Guyana on behalf of the Caribbean Community on \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters (see A/68/PV.46). I also join other delegations \r\nin thanking the representative of China for introducing \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/68/2).\r\nThe reform of the Security Council, one of the \r\nmost powerful organs of the United Nations, is an issue \r\nthat has long been on the agenda of this institution. \r\nThe Security Council’s primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nhas made it necessary to ensure that there is greater \r\naccess, inclusiveness, transparency, accountability \r\nand effectiveness for an improvement in the Council’s \r\noverall performance.\r\nSince Jamaica became a Member of the United \r\nNations, on 18 September 1962, we have witnessed a \r\nsteady growth in the membership of the Organization \r\nfollowing the independence of many former colonies. \r\nWith the rapid influx of new Members came loud calls \r\nin 1963 for a rearrangement of the composition of the \r\nSecurity Council. Jamaica was at the vanguard of that \r\ninitiative, which heralded an expansion in the number \r\nof non-permanent seats from 6 to 10. Since then, we \r\nhave had the privilege of serving twice on the Security \r\nCouncil. Having done so, we have experienced first-\r\nhand the complexities of the Council and its inner \r\nworkings, as well as the need for its restructuring \r\nin order to safeguard its legitimacy and enhance its \r\ncredibility.\r\nJamaica therefore raises its voice in support of \r\nthe continuation of negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and underscores the urgent need to move the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process forward. In that \r\nvein, we welcome this debate and applaud the President \r\n"
