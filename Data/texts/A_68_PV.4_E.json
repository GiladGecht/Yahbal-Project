"In the absence of the President, Mr. Moreno \r\n(Spain), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 5.50 p.m.\r\nHigh-level Meeting on the Realization of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and Other \r\nInternationally Agreed Development Goals for \r\nPersons with Disabilities\r\nAgenda item 27 (continued)\r\nSocial development\r\n(b) Social development, including questions \r\nrelating to the world social situation and to \r\nyouth, ageing, disabled persons and the family\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 3 of \r\nresolution 66/124, of 19 December 2011, we will now \r\nhear presentations by the co-Chairs of round table \r\ndiscussions 1 and 2 of the High-level Meeting.\r\nI give the f loor to Mr. Arsenio Balisacan, Secretary \r\nof Socioeconomic Planning of the Philippines and \r\nco-Chair of round table 1.\r\nMr. Balisacan (Philippines): Today presents a \r\nremarkable opportunity to push for a post-2015 era that \r\nis inclusive of persons with disabilities. International \r\nand regional development cooperation partnerships can \r\nplay a key role in promoting that objective. The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda must serve to send a clear message \r\nto the world that we value everyone’s contribution, \r\nincluding those of persons with disabilities. A human-\r\nbased approach to disability needs to be adopted, one \r\nthat can in turn contribute to national development and \r\nwealth creation. \r\nSeveral Member States noted that the entry into \r\nthe force of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities and its Optional \r\nProtocol had provided a platform to advocate for \r\nchange and a paradigm shift from a welfare-based \r\napproach to one based on promoting the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities. At the same time, a gap \r\nbetween policy and implementation remains. Member \r\nStates emphasized the importance of the universal \r\nratification of the Conventoin to ensure the universal \r\nenjoyment of the rights it enshrines by persons with \r\ndisabilities. Therefore, the signature and ratification \r\nof the convention and its Optional Protocol should be \r\npromoted.\r\nThe international community is committed to \r\nchanging the situation and to advance the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities. The outcome document adopted \r\ntoday (resolution 68/3) recognizes the urgent need for \r\naction by all the relevant stakeholders to promote more \r\nambitious disability-inclusive development strategies \r\nbacked up by increased international cooperation and \r\nsupport.\r\nThe focus of round table 1 was the role of \r\ninternational and regional cooperation and partnerships \r\nin promoting the participation and inclusion of persons \r\nwith disabilities to achieve disability-inclusive \r\ndevelopment. In addition to the many examples of \r\nnational and regional efforts, numerous Member States \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.4\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n4th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 23 September 2013, 5.30 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

These have included supporting \r\nthe assessment of national capacity gaps and subsequent \r\nefforts towards capacity-building; providing economic \r\nand technical assistance in the implementation, \r\nmonitoring and evaluation of disability-sensitive \r\nnational policies and programmes; supporting public \r\nawareness campaigns to increase knowledge and \r\nunderstanding in the larger society regarding disability \r\nand the situation of persons with disabilities; building \r\nknowledge and understanding of the situation of \r\npersons with disabilities to support evidence-based \r\npolicymaking — this can include support for research \r\nand access to scientific and technical knowledge; \r\nsupporting access to and the sharing of accessible \r\nand assistive technologies and through the transfer \r\nof technologies; and supporting accessibility through \r\nprojects related to the environment, transportation and \r\ninformation and communications technology. \r\nA number of participants highlighted the \r\nimportance of taking a twin-track approach to \r\nprogramme development and implementation to ensure \r\ndisability-inclusive development. \r\nRegionalism remains an important engine for \r\ninternational partnerships. Regional initiatives, \r\nparticularly in the context of regional decades, are \r\ncentral to mainstreaming disability in development \r\ncooperation and can help with mainstreaming on \r\nthe ground. We heard examples from the Caribbean \r\nCommunity of its regional initiatives to address the \r\nissue of climate change. The European Union stressed \r\nthat it would continue to ensure that the disability \r\ndimension is part of our development work. In Asia and \r\nthe Pacific, the Asian strategy has helped reaffirm the \r\ncommitment to persons with disabilities to make their \r\nrights real. Developments within the Southern Common \r\nMarket highlighted the growing importance of South-\r\nSouth, triangular and decentralized cooperation based \r\non mutual interests and shared responsibility of our \r\nparties. \r\nPartnerships between private sector entities, the \r\npublic sector and civil society entities can also play \r\nan important role in advancing disability-inclusive \r\ndevelopment. Equal participation in economic, social \r\nand political life can contribute to economic growth. \r\nThere is a need to further strengthen international \r\ncooperation and support domestic efforts for the \r\nrealization of the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, leading up to 2015 and beyond, for persons \r\nwith disabilities. Increasing mobilization of public \r\nstressed the importance of including specific reference \r\nto disability issues in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda referring to the remaining challenges and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn the same way, many Member States reaffirmed \r\ntheir commitment to strengthening international and \r\nregional partnerships and cooperation, with numerous \r\nStates mentioning it as key to mitigating ongoing \r\nchallenges for persons with disabilities. Several Member \r\nStates called for strengthening South-South cooperation \r\nin particular. Governments also placed emphasis on \r\nthe protection of children with disabilities, improving \r\naccess to services such as education and health, \r\nopportunities for skills-training and employment, as \r\nwell as access to appropriate housing, as important \r\nareas for action. Multiple approaches should be used in \r\nreaching out to the diverse population of persons with \r\ndisabilities, as well as to their families.\r\nUntil now, the potential of development \r\ncooperation to advance the achievements of sustainable \r\ndevelopment by supporting the contribution of persons \r\nwith disabilities has been largely unrealized. That must \r\nchange.\r\nInternational and regional cooperation and \r\npartnerships will be essential components to support \r\nthe mainstreaming of disability in development \r\ntowards 2015 and beyond. Today Member States \r\nindicated that they have made invaluable progress at \r\nthe domestic level. They also highlighted a number \r\nof common challenges faced in terms of international \r\nand regional cooperation and partnerships. That \r\nincludes a lack of capacity, including in human \r\nresources, which can impede the development and \r\nimplementation of policies or programmes that support \r\ndisability-inclusive development, as well as financial \r\nand technical constraints, which can inhibit action \r\nthrough both international and regional cooperation \r\nand partnerships.\r\nThere is both a lack of awareness of disability and \r\nan understanding of various issues, such as gender and \r\ndisability perspectives. A lack of disability-specific \r\ndata renders disability invisible in development goals, \r\nmonitoring and evaluations. Finally, there is a lack of \r\ncoordination among the various actors involved in a \r\ngiven development initiative.\r\nWe have heard many examples of the ways in which \r\ninternational and regional cooperation and partnership \r\ncan serve as vehicles for change in national efforts to \r\n13-48395 3/5\r\n23/09/2013 A/68/PV.4\r\nensure that persons with disabilities can enjoy the \r\nbenefits of development on equal grounds with others. \r\nAttention must be paid to multiple grounds for \r\nexclusion and discrimination. This implies collecting \r\ndata and strengthening research towards discovering the \r\nunderlying reasons for exclusion and discrimination. As \r\npersons with disabilities are not a homogenous group, \r\ndata needs to be disaggregated by impairment, barriers \r\nand other grounds for exclusion, such as, for example, \r\ngeographic location, age and gender. Discrimination \r\nagainst women and girls with disabilities should \r\nbe taken into account when discussing the future \r\ndevelopment agenda. \r\nThirdly, we must advance accessibility. The removal \r\nof physical, social, economic, communicational, \r\nattitudinal, institutional and legal barriers needs to \r\nbe taken into account when implementing the future \r\ngoals of the post-2015 agenda in order to ensure equal \r\naccess to inclusive education, employment, open and \r\ndecent work, social protection and health-care services. \r\nSpecific and appropriate measures to overcome such \r\nbarriers could include, inter alia, engineering universal \r\ndesign and assistive technologies and promoting \r\ncommunity-based rehabilitation. In this regard, all \r\nMember States should work together to strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation and partnerships, inter alia \r\nthrough technology transfer, finance and capacity-\r\nbuilding. \r\nFourthly, on the importance of an effective and \r\nmeaningful participation, persons with disabilities \r\nare key actors and stakeholders when elaborating, \r\nimplementing and monitoring the post-2015 agenda, \r\nand they should be closely consulted with and actively \r\ninvolved, including through their representative \r\norganizations. This should also apply to global and \r\nnational development agendas. Inclusive education \r\nshould be a priority when considering the targets of \r\nthe post-2015 agenda, as education is a crucial factor \r\nin improving opportunities for participation and a \r\nkey vector for poverty reduction and decent work. \r\nFurthermore, all development efforts should strive to \r\nbuild the capacity of persons with disabilities and their \r\norganizations in order for them to be able to know and \r\nclaim their rights. \r\nFifthly and lastly, we must increase follow-up and \r\nmonitoring. To strengthen the follow-up and monitoring \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda, States should \r\nensure that mechanisms for follow-up and monitoring \r\nand private resources and exchange of goods and good \r\npractices, including by utilizing multiple modalities \r\nof regional and subregional cooperation, North-South \r\ncooperation, South-South and triangular cooperation, is \r\nencouraged to achieve this objective. All stakeholders \r\nshould be encouraged to take urgent action to promote \r\na disability perspective in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. We must ensure that we leave no one behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to Ms. Heidi Hautala, Minister of \r\nInternational Development of Finland, who co-chaired \r\nround table 2.\r\nMs. Hautala (Finland): Allow me to read out the \r\nsummary of the co-chairs of round table 2. \r\nIn terms of conclusions and recommendations, \r\nwelcoming the adoption of the outcome document \r\n(resolution 68/3) of the High-level Meeting on Disability \r\nand Development, which reaffirms the international \r\ncommunity’s commitment to advancing the rights \r\nof all persons with disabilities and work together for \r\ndisability-inclusive development, round table 2 brought \r\nforward the following recommendations on how to \r\nensure a disability-inclusive post-2015 agenda. \r\nFirst, we must adopt an inclusive and equitable \r\npost-2015 development agenda. According to \r\narticle 32 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities, all development cooperation \r\nshould be inclusive of and accessible to persons with \r\ndisabilities. Adopting an inclusive and equitable post-\r\n2015 development agenda implies recognizing that the \r\nultimate goal of development cooperation is to further \r\nhuman dignity, social and economic inclusion, equality \r\nand poverty eradication. The content of goals, targets \r\nand indicators of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nshould correspond to principles and standards of civic, \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural rights of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \r\nand other international human rights instruments.\r\nSecondly, we must ensure equality and \r\nnon-discrimination. In order to be able to ensure \r\ndisability-inclusive development, the international \r\ncommunity should strive to guarantee that equality \r\nand non-discrimination are reflected throughout the \r\nfuture development agenda. Ensuring universality in \r\ngoal-setting is important but cannot alone contribute \r\nto reducing existing inequalities. Special measures \r\nand specific targets should be designed to remove the \r\nbarriers that persons with disabilities are facing and \r\n4/5 13-48395\r\nA/68/PV.4 23/09/2013\r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and other \r\ninternationally agreed development goals for persons \r\nwith disabilities. Member States have also underscored \r\nthe need for all to take urgent action towards the \r\nadoption and implementation of more ambitious \r\ndisability national development strategies, backed by \r\nincreased international cooperation. There has to be \r\nan interplay between national and international action. \r\nPersons with disabilities will remain disproportionately \r\nvulnerable to poverty without a targeted focus on their \r\nrights and concerns. I have seen that myself in my many \r\nyears in humanitarian and conflict-related situations. \r\nWithout more coherent and targeted poverty reduction \r\nefforts, we may not be able to achieve, or sustain, MDG \r\nprogress.\r\nI fully agreed with Minister Balisacan and Minister \r\nHautala when they stressed the importance of listening \r\nto all voices and all persons with disabilities as we \r\nwork to formulate a global development agenda beyond \r\n2015. I have a special responsibility, given to me by \r\nthe Secretary-General, to follow this issue, which will \r\nbe with us for the next two years or so. I can assure \r\nthe Assembly that I will keep in mind the situation of \r\npeople with disabilities. I hope that their voices will be \r\nheard, both in the meeting rooms at the United Nations \r\nbut also back in their own countries and capitals. \r\nA Prime Minister once taught me something about \r\nhow to measure the quality of a society. He said, “Every \r\nsociety should, in the end, be judged by how it treats its \r\nmost vulnerable people.” That is the quality control of a \r\ngood society: how do we treat the most vulnerable. It is \r\na very useful rule in life. If one judges how disabilities \r\nare treated and then measures that quality, then I think \r\nwe will have very important advice that we could use in \r\nsetting the direction in a more determined way.\r\nMember States have also resolved to undertake \r\nwhat I call a range of bold actions, namely, first, to \r\nachieve the full implementation of the normative \r\nframework on disability and development; secondly, to \r\nensure that all development policies reflect the needs \r\nof all persons with disabilities; thirdly, to develop \r\nplans, legislation, policy and institutional structures \r\nand capacities to advance the inclusion of persons \r\nwith disabilities; fourthly, to promote the inclusion \r\nof persons with disabilities in strategic areas such as \r\neducation, health care, social protection, employment \r\nand humanitarian responses; and fifthly, to improve \r\ndisability data collection, analysis and monitoring. \r\nof international and national plans and commitments \r\nare set up and inclusive of and accessible to persons \r\nwith disabilities. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the Deputy Secretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: I understand that \r\nthis has been an extraordinary day. Today’s High-level \r\nMeeting is a milestone in the history of the United \r\nNations. Member States have shown leadership and \r\ncommitment by adopting a new tool — an action-oriented \r\nfinal document (resolution 68/3) — to strengthen our \r\nwork to realize disability-inclusive development at all \r\nlevels. On behalf of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nI want to warmly thank members for all their efforts \r\nand work for an extremely important cause, which I \r\nwould characterize as practical solidarity with people \r\nwith disabilities. That reconfirmation of every human \r\nbeing’s equal value is, to me, what this is all about. We \r\nare all aware of the challenge. But today we recognize \r\nthe enormous opportunity of the more than 1 billion \r\npeople with disabilities being given the chance to make \r\nthe most of their lives. Let me repeat and highlight \r\nsome key features of the document. \r\nBut before doing so, let me say something informally \r\nabout the sad fact that evidently many participants were \r\nnot given an opportunity to make their statements. I \r\nam a former President of the General Assembly, and \r\nI can recall similar instances when I was President. \r\nI want to tell participants how important it is that all \r\nvoices be heard. But with modern technology evolving \r\nso much more than when I was President, seven years \r\nago, members should know that every speech they \r\nsubmit to the Secretariat will be posted on the website \r\nof the High-level Meeting. That is why we have so \r\nmany readers — the many people on the outside who \r\nfollow these proceedings. I would therefore encourage \r\neveryone to post their statements, in particular those \r\nwho did not have a chance to speak. I regret deeply \r\nthat that was the case. The Organization builds on \r\nuniversality and sovereign equality. I really feel the \r\npain that some have, having written speeches with so \r\nmuch of their soul, blood and heart — and then not \r\nbeing able to deliver them. But please pass them on. I \r\nfeel very strongly about that. I will follow up this issue \r\nmyself. \r\nTurning to some of the highlights, as members \r\nknow very well, I find it important that Member States \r\nhave reiterated their determination to achieve the \r\n13-48395 5/5\r\n23/09/2013 A/68/PV.4\r\nit is and the world as it must be, as we want it to be and \r\nas it is possible to make it. \r\nThanks to those here, perhaps that gap has narrowed \r\ntoday. But that depends upon what we do. In a way, this \r\nis just a step in one direction. Looking back on many \r\nyears in diplomacy and having gone through many \r\nprocesses of negotiation, in the end what counts is what \r\nwe do in practice and in action. The accountability for \r\nthis outcome document rests on all of us. We have to \r\ntranslate the document into practical solidarity — the \r\nword I used in the beginning — and live up to the \r\ncommitments that we are making and what the Charter \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all \r\nthe documents that relate to the situation of persons \r\nwith disabilities are all about. \r\nLet us therefore commit together to build an \r\ninclusive development agenda that fully incorporates \r\nthe rights and concerns of persons with disabilities for \r\nthe good of all and for the good of a life of dignity for \r\nall. A life of dignity is a life in peace; a life of dignity \r\nis a life with development; a life of dignity is a life with \r\nrespect for human rights and the rule of law, including \r\nfor those who are in the most vulnerable positions. Let \r\nus prove that we are standing up for the equal value of \r\nevery human being. \r\nI thank delegations for their efforts. I am sorry for \r\nthe fact that we could not continue the Meeting for two \r\ndays, which we probably needed, but representatives \r\nknow how this week is. I really want again to plead \r\nwith representatives to give us their speeches and let \r\nus see this as part of an ongoing effort to which we are \r\ncommitted. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General for his statement.\r\nThe High-level Meeting on the Realization \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and Other \r\nInternationally Agreed Development Goals for Persons \r\nwith Disabilities is now concluded.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 27.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\nFinnish President Paasikivi also taught me \r\nsomething. He said that the source of wisdom was \r\nknowing the facts. I think that data collection is very \r\nimportant. Lastly, Member States resolved to encourage \r\nthe mobilization of public and private resources on a \r\nsustainable basis at all levels to mainstream disability \r\nin development. Those are six very important points of \r\naction.\r\nIn his reports on disability and development, the \r\nSecretary-General, together with all the relevant United \r\nNations entities, will provide an update on progress \r\nin implementing the outcome document. Those \r\nreports will serve as an important tool to maintain the \r\nmomentum for global-wide action on disabilities and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nI call upon all Member States, civil society and \r\nother actors to implement the international framework \r\non disability and development, and the outcome \r\ndocument of this High-level Meeting. That is a shared \r\nresponsibility. The Secretary-General and I are fully \r\ncommitted to mobilizing the United Nations system \r\nbehind these goals.\r\nParticipants should be proud of their \r\naccomplishments today. We would not be celebrating \r\nthis achievement without the tireless efforts of everyone \r\nin the Hall, or without their work back in their own \r\ncountries communities. Participants are helping to \r\ngive life to core values and fundamental principles, \r\nthat is, the dignity of every human being, equality of \r\nopportunity, and full participation. That is the core \r\nof participants’ mission, but it is also the heart and \r\nsoul of the United Nations Charter and the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. Let us never forget those \r\nguiding principles of the Organization, what we stand \r\nfor and what we have to show in practical deeds in \r\nlife. Our job is to work to close the gap between the \r\nvalues and ideals of the Charter and the sometimes sad \r\nrealities of life around the world. We have to narrow the \r\ndivide between the world as it is today and the world \r\nas we want it to be. That is actually the mission of the \r\nOrganization: to diminish the gap between the world as \r\n"
