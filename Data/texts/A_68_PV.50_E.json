"The meeting was called to order at 10 a.m.\r\nTyphoon in the Philippines\r\nThe President: Before proceeding to the items \r\non the agenda, I would like, on behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, to extend our deepest sympathy and heartfelt \r\ncondolences to the Government and the people of the \r\nPhilippines for the tragic loss of life and damage that \r\nhave resulted from the recent typhoon. Today’s solemn \r\ngathering reiterates the outpouring of condolences and \r\nsolidarity of the international community with the \r\nPhilippines in its hour of grief.\r\nI now invite representatives to stand and observe a \r\nminute of silence in tribute to the memory of those who \r\nlost their lives.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nAgenda items 9 and 14 (continued)\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council\r\nReport of the Economic and Social Council (A/68/3)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/68/229)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/67/736)\r\nThe President: I recall that, pursuant to \r\nresolution 58/316, of 1 July 2004, the Assembly, on the \r\nrecommendation of the General Committee, decided \r\nat its 1st plenary meeting, on 18 September 2013, to \r\nconsider agenda item 9 in its entirety in plenary, on \r\nthe understanding that the administrative, programme \r\nand budgetary aspects should be dealt with by the Fifth \r\nCommittee. At the same meeting, the Assembly took \r\nnote of the clarification that, in implementing resolution \r\n58/316 to consider agenda item 9 in its entirety in \r\nplenary, the relevant parts of Chapter I of the report \r\nthat are deal with agenda items already allocated to the \r\nMain Committees will be considered by the Committee \r\nconcerned for final action by the General Assembly.\r\nIn connection with agenda item 14, members will \r\nrecall that, pursuant to General Assembly resolution \r\n57/270 B, the Assembly decided to consider, under the \r\nitem, the chapters of the annual report of the Economic \r\nand Social Council relevant to the integrated and \r\ncoordinated implementation of and follow-up to the \r\noutcomes of the major United Nations conferences \r\nand summits, including through the participation in its \r\ndiscussions of the President of the Council.\r\nUnder agenda item 9, the Assembly has before it the \r\nreport of the Economic and Social Council circulated in \r\ndocument A/68/3. Under the same item, the Assembly \r\nalso has before it a note by the Secretary-General, \r\ncirculated in document A/68/229, transmitting the \r\nreport of the Executive Director of the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund on the United Nations Population \r\nAward. Under agenda item 14, the Assembly has before \r\nit a report by the Secretary-General circulated in \r\ndocument A/67/736.\r\nPermit me now to make a brief statement.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.50\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n50th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 11 November 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

They are, first, that \r\nthe “silo” approach in implementing the environment \r\nand development agendas needs to be addressed. That \r\nidea was fully incorporated into the proceedings of the \r\ninaugural meeting of the High-level Political Forum and \r\nin the outcome document of the special event. Secondly, \r\nthe global partnership for development must be renewed \r\nin order to support the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nand that requires effective accountability and monitoring \r\nat all levels. Thirdly, an integrated development agenda \r\nrequires coherent and responsive institutions at all \r\nlevels. Ensuring integrated and coordinated follow-up \r\nand review of the implementation of the outcomes from \r\nthe major United Nations conferences in the economic, \r\nsocial, environmental and related fields will be a central \r\nchallenge for the success of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the theme for the \r\nforthcoming session of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil will focus on the comprehensive assessment \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals. That theme, \r\ntogether with the 2014 meeting of the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum, will provide an excellent opportunity \r\nfor all relevant stakeholders to engage in collectively \r\nforging the post-2015 development agenda. Resolution \r\n68/1, which calls for the most far-reaching reform of \r\nthe Council since 1991, will strengthen the Economic \r\nand Social Council’s contributions to the new agenda, \r\nand the General Assembly stands ready to support its \r\nspeedy and full implementation.\r\nI look forward to continued collaboration between \r\nthe Assembly and the Council throughout the current \r\nsession, and my hope and expectation is that by \r\nenhancing our work together we will produce more \r\nmeaningful outcomes.\r\nI now give the f loor to the President of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, His Excellency Mr. Néstor Osorio, \r\nto introduce the report of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Osorio (Colombia), President of the Economic \r\nand Social Council (spoke in Spanish): Allow me at \r\nthe outset to align myself with the President’s words \r\nand the General Assembly’s sentiments concerning the \r\nterrible tragedy that has struck the Philippines in recent \r\ndays, with immense human and physical damage, and to \r\nexpress on my own behalf and of that of the Economic \r\nand Social Council our most heartfelt condolences.\r\nIt is my pleasure to once again welcome the \r\nPresident of the Economic and Social Council to \r\nintroduce the 2013 report of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, which will serve as a complement to last \r\nweek’s informal briefing on the strengthening of that \r\nbody. During that briefing, many delegations shared \r\ntheir observations and perspectives, and my team and \r\nI have taken due note. In the sixty-eighth session, we \r\nwill seek to reinforce cooperation and coordination \r\nbetween the presidencies of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council in accordance with \r\nresolution 68/1 on the strengthening of the Economic \r\nand Social Council and resolution 67/290 on the format \r\nand organizational arrangements of the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum.\r\nThe report that will be introduced today closes \r\nan important cycle in the work of the Council, which \r\nwill undergo significant changes next year as a \r\nresult of the aforementioned resolution 68/1. During \r\nthe 2013 session, the Council realized significant \r\naccomplishments through its high-level coordination, \r\noperational, humanitarian and general segments, as \r\nwell as through the work and outcomes of its subsidiary \r\nbodies.\r\nThe 2013 Economic and Social Council report \r\nprovides information on a wide number of topics \r\nthat either call for action by the General Assembly \r\nor are simply brought to its attention. I invite all \r\nMember States, United Nations system organizations \r\nand observers to carefully analyse, take stock of and \r\nsubsequently implement those outcomes. Specifically, I \r\nwould like to highlight the results of the Council’s 2013 \r\nsubstantive session, which was held in Geneva last July. \r\nThat session included a high-level segment focused on \r\nhow science, technology, innovation and culture can \r\ncontribute to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and sustainable development in general.\r\nTwo new noteworthy elements from that ministerial \r\nsegment were the national voluntary presentations and \r\nthe thematic debate on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and the post-2015 development agenda. Those \r\ninformative discussions and exchanges provided \r\ninsights into the preparations for and discussions \r\nduring the General Assembly’s special event to follow \r\nup on efforts made towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which was held this past September.\r\nIt is worth underscoring three key messages drawn \r\nfrom the 2013 session and the Economic and Social \r\n13-55626 3/14\r\n11/11/2013 A/68/PV.50\r\nvoluntary national presentations. They provided \r\nvaluable information on their success factors and \r\nlessons learned. The voluntary national presentations \r\nhave become a vital platform for the exchange of best \r\npractices and lessons learned at the national level.\r\nI note that the ministerial declaration that was to \r\nbe the outcome of the work of the high-level segment \r\nin July was subject to a sensible and detailed analysis \r\nand negotiating process, in which conclusions and \r\nrecommendations of great significance were reached. \r\nHowever, I must inform the Assembly that the \r\nnegotiations have not yet been concluded, and member \r\nStates have asked me for a few additional days to \r\nattempt to smooth over the differences that persist on \r\ncertain aspects of the ministerial declaration. I ask for \r\nthe Assembly’s indulgence and patience, and I hope \r\nthat within two or three weeks the President of the \r\nAssembly will grant me a brief pause in the Assembly’s \r\nwork to announce the final developments on this issue, \r\nwhich I hope will be positive.\r\nDuring the coordination segment, we were \r\nreminded that international agreements should be \r\nsubject to effective monitoring in order to assess their \r\nimplementation in terms of promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment. As part of these efforts, we focused \r\non monitoring last year’s ministerial declaration on \r\nproductive capacity, employment and decent work, and \r\non financing for development.\r\nThis year’s operational activities segment gave \r\nMember States the opportunity to engage in a dialogue \r\nabout the changing nature of the commitments to \r\npromote development and pending changes in the \r\nway that the activities of the United Nations system \r\nare carried out. The United Nations must help in the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand in the elaboration of a post-2015 development \r\nframework.\r\nAlthough in general participants were encouraged \r\nby the progress made  in the implementation of \r\nresolution 67/226, on the quadrennial comprehensive \r\npolicy review of 2012, Member States expressed their \r\nwish that the United Nations system step up measures \r\nin several areas, including the following: first, the \r\nstrengthening of national institutions and capacities; \r\nsecondly, the simplification and harmonization of \r\nbusiness practices and the publication of reports; thirdly, \r\nthe full implementation of the “Delivering as one” \r\ninitiative; fourthly, reducing unnecessary competition \r\nIt is an honour and a pleasure for me to address \r\nthe General Assembly to introduce the report of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for 2013 (A/68/3).\r\nThe year 2013 has been an important one for the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. The General Assembly’s \r\nconsideration of resolution 61/16, on strengthening the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, established a framework \r\nfor the Council’s work over the year. The special \r\nministerial meeting of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nheld in September 2012, provided substantive guidance \r\nto that strategic redesign. Those efforts culminated in \r\nthe adoption of resolution 68/1, which has led to the \r\nmost sweeping reform of the Council since 1991. The \r\nimplementation of that resolution’s provisions is a top \r\npriority for the Council, which continues to strive to \r\nfurther strengthen the Council and its functioning.\r\nIn this context, in 2013, the Council addressed \r\nseveral ways to improve its contribution to \r\ndevelopment. In particular, the Council focused on \r\nhow it conceptualizes its role and on its contribution \r\nto the post-2015 framework, including its possible \r\nrole in implementation monitoring and supervision. \r\nThe Council also focused on how to better fulfil its \r\nfunctions in service to its purpose by improving its \r\nworking methods and supervision of subsidiary bodies. \r\nIt also worked to improve its interaction with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the Second and Third \r\nCommittees of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Council will continue to focus on substantive \r\nissues within the framework of sustainable development, \r\nas was the case with the annual ministerial review of \r\nscience, technology and innovation, the potential of \r\nculture, productive capacity, employment and decent \r\nwork. The Council will also continue to deepen its \r\ndialogue on international cooperation to promote \r\ngreater accountability.\r\nI would now like to briefly highlight the Council’s \r\nmain advances and overall achievements.\r\nThe 2013 high-level segment of the Council, held \r\nin July in Geneva, enjoyed significant participation. \r\nThe annual ministerial review brought together a wide \r\nrange of stakeholders and helped to expand the United \r\nNations development programme. The review focused \r\non science, technology and innovation, and the potential \r\nof culture, for promoting sustainable development \r\nand achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nI wish to commend in particular the Governments of \r\nFrance, Nigeria, Peru and Viet Nam for their invaluable \r\n4/14 13-55626\r\nA/68/PV.50 11/11/2013\r\nthe post-2015 agenda will lead to tangible and concrete \r\nresults. To support the new post-2015 development \r\nagenda effectively, the United Nations as a whole needs \r\nto ensure that it is fit to accomplish the work.\r\nThe United Nations will need to continue to \r\nstrengthen its role in improving global dialogue and \r\npolicymaking. It will be necessary to streamline the \r\nwork of the United Nations system, both vertically and \r\nhorizontally, especially in setting new global norms \r\nand standards. The Organization will need to deepen \r\nits operational oversight role and the linkages between \r\nthe normative and operational aspects of development.\r\nI believe that with the reform adopted by the \r\nAssembly, the Council is prepared to assume its \r\nresponsibilities to fulfil those roles. The Council \r\nalso welcomes the decision to convene the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development, recently \r\nestablished under the auspices of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, to advance sustainable development and \r\nto deepen the Council’s role as a platform for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and in integrating its three dimensions. \r\nWith the new intergovernmental structure, the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council, and \r\nthe High-level Political Forum are well positioned to \r\ncontribute to monitoring and global accountability in \r\nthe post-2015 era.\r\nThe implementation of the provisions of the \r\nrecently adopted resolution 68/1 will be a priority \r\nfor the Economic and Social Council as it continues \r\nto address progress towards the the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, to shape the post-2015 agenda, and \r\nto play its fundamental role in addressing the problems \r\nand concerns of countries in special situations. The \r\nCouncil remains fully committed to that work.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to affirm that our collective \r\nrelevance and ability to guide the international \r\ncommunity and States on a path to development that \r\nis more balanced and more inclusive is a historic \r\nundertaking that requires us to act consistently and \r\nin coordination at the multilateral level. We have a \r\nhistoric opportunity of immense dimensions, which we \r\nmust assume by agreeing policies that will lead to the \r\nsustainable development that we advocate so that our \r\nplanet will be better preserved and humankind can live \r\nin better conditions.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for his briefing.\r\nfor funds at the national level; and fifthly, reviewing \r\nthe role of United Nations resident coordinators.\r\nIn the 2013 humanitarian affairs segment, we \r\nexamined how the United Nations, Governments, the \r\nprivate sector, affected communities and other new \r\nagents such as the volunteer community, can, acting \r\ncollectively, adapt and better respond to the changing \r\nhumanitarian environment. That helped to promote \r\ndialogue for the World Humanitarian Summit to be held \r\nin 2015.\r\nThe general segment this year allowed us to \r\nbetter appreciate various important issues, such \r\nas the implementation of the 10-year framework \r\nof programmes on sustainable consumption and \r\nproduction patterns, provided for at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, which \r\nreaffirmed the Council’s role in issues related to \r\nsustainable development.\r\nRegarding the link between peace and security, \r\nthe Council considered the experience gained from the \r\ntransition of some African countries that had emerged \r\nfrom conflict, based on the lessons learned in various \r\ncases, including that of South Sudan. Haiti continued to \r\noccupy a central place in our activities. We examined \r\nthe tangible progress and the obstacles that still exist \r\nthere and extended the mandate of the Ad Hoc Advisory \r\nGroup on Haiti. In so doing, the Council identified the \r\nnecessary scope for deepening its relationship with the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, and we will soon hold a \r\njoint meeting to review those agenda items.\r\nDuring the thematic debate of the Council, and \r\nas a contribution of the Council to the special event \r\nto follow up on efforts made towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the development \r\nagenda post-2015, which was organized by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly in September, the \r\ngeneral opinion was that this agenda should be based \r\non the Millennium Development Goals and focused \r\non sustainable development. That effort would need to \r\nconsist in part in promoting the integration between \r\nenvironmental and socioeconomic development issues \r\ninstead of viewing them as separate categories.\r\nThe Council also stressed that the global partnership \r\nfor development should be renewed to support the new \r\ndevelopment agenda and needs to be accompanied by \r\nsufficient financial support. It sent a clear message on \r\nthe need for effective accountability and an effective \r\nmonitoring framework at all levels in order to ensure that \r\n13-55626 5/14\r\n11/11/2013 A/68/PV.50\r\nelaborate the development goals of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nThe Group holds the view that the interrelated \r\nchallenges of poverty eradication and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are at the heart of the Council’s mandate. \r\nThe strengthening of the Economic and Social Council \r\nshould be aimed at making the Council a more relevant \r\nand responsive multilateral intergovernmental body \r\nto follow up on the outcomes of all United Nations \r\nconferences, including the political commitments \r\nrenewed at the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, with increased international \r\ncooperation.\r\nIn that regard, the Group of 77 urges the Council, \r\nin accordance with resolution 61/16, to strengthen its \r\nrelations with other intergovernmental bodies, especially \r\nthe newly established High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development, the regional commissions, \r\nthe Bretton Woods institutions, the subsidiary bodies \r\nof the Economic and Social Council, and other relevant \r\nstakeholders. Such strengthening should bring greater \r\ncoherence to the work of the Council system, making it \r\nan effective and relevant United Nations body that not \r\nonly follows up on the agreed development goals, but \r\nalso responds to new and emerging global challenges.\r\nMr. Antony (India): It is my distinct honour to \r\nmake a statement in today’s important joint debate. \r\nThe United Nations embodies humankind’s faith in \r\nmultilateralism to solve global problems. Over the \r\ndecades, it has rendered great service to humankind.\r\nIndia aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Fiji on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina.\r\nIndia attaches great importance to the work of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. The Council has an \r\nacknowledged role as a principal body for coordination, \r\npolicy review, policy dialogue and recommendations \r\non issues of economic and social development.\r\nGlobal cooperation on sustainable development \r\nis today at an important crossroads. The work on \r\naccelerating the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), negotiating a set of \r\nsustainable development goals, formulating a strategy \r\nfor financing sustainable development and arriving at a \r\npost-2015 development agenda will be the key priorities \r\nof the international community over the next two years.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council has an important \r\nrole to play in that endeavour.\r\nMr. Thomson (Fiji): On behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, I wish to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nreport contained in document A/67/736 and to welcome \r\nthe report of the Economic and Social Council for 2013, \r\ncontained in document A/68/3. At the outset, the Group \r\nwould like to recognize the dynamic leadership of the \r\nPresident of the Council, Ambassador Néstor Osorio, \r\nand his Bureau in guiding the work of the Council in \r\n2013. Our gratitude also goes to the Secretariat staff for \r\ntheir hard work, as well as to all the facilitators of draft \r\nresolutions for their tireless efforts.\r\nWe would also like to acknowledge the various \r\nmeetings held under the auspices of the Council, \r\nincluding the special high-level meeting of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council with the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development; \r\nthe special meeting on external debt sustainability and \r\ndevelopment; and the special meeting on international \r\ncooperation in tax matters. Those meetings have \r\nprovided us with the opportunity to review and \r\nstrengthen the relationship between the Council and \r\nother stakeholders through constructive debates on \r\nimportant global development issues.\r\nWhile the Group welcomes the report of the President \r\nof Economic and Social Council, we note with concern \r\nthat work is still pending on the Council’s substantive \r\nsession. We regret that, three and half months after its \r\nJuly session, we are still not in a position to adopt the \r\ncoordination segment resolution or the 2012 ministerial \r\ndeclaration. The Group considers the ministerial \r\ndeclaration to be a significant document, especially \r\nin the light of the importance of science, technology, \r\ninnovation and culture as both enablers and drivers \r\nfor promoting sustainable development and achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We urge \r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council to \r\ncontinue his leadership to guide members towards \r\nachieving a consensual outcome as soon as possible.\r\nWith reference to the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the implementation of resolution 61/16, \r\non the strengthening of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, the Group of 77 and China concurs with its \r\nrecommendation that the Council needs to transform \r\nitself into an issues-oriented, knowledge-based, \r\nstakeholder-friendly intergovernmental body. We \r\nbelieve that the Council should play a pivotal role in \r\nthe United Nations, especially in view of the need \r\nto accelerate the achievement of the MDGs and to \r\n6/14 13-55626\r\nA/68/PV.50 11/11/2013\r\nagainst women in order to ensure greater safety and \r\nsecurity for them. A Government of India initiative \r\nto provide unique identification (ID) to all Indian \r\ncitizens is perhaps the world’s largest ID scheme. More \r\nthan 520 million Indians have already been enrolled. \r\nSustainable development is one of the primary goals of \r\nour twelfth five-year plan. We have been fortunate to \r\nhave leaders who have fully recognized the need for \r\nharmony with nature. In fact, our late Prime Minister, \r\nMrs. Indira Gandhi, was the only head of Government \r\nto attend the United Nations Conference on the Human \r\nEnvironment in Stockholm in 1972.\r\nIndia’s development experience has shown that \r\nhuman development indicators can be improved even \r\nwith low per capita incomes. Kerala, my state of origin, \r\nhas managed to reduce infant mortality rates to levels \r\nnot achieved by many rich countries. We have created \r\na programme called the Zero Landless Project, through \r\nwhich all families in Kerala state are provided with \r\nland on which they can build a house of their own. \r\nKerala has also undertaken pioneering initiatives in \r\npublic health, such as by producing generic medicines \r\nand cutting-edge treatments and surgery available at \r\naffordable rates. The mass contact programme of the \r\nstate government has been recognized by the United \r\nNations.\r\nIndia is fully committed to playing a constructive \r\nrole in fashioning an ambitious, equitable and \r\ncomprehensive post-2015 development agenda. We \r\nbelieve that with our collaborative efforts and collective \r\nwill, we can create a better world for ourselves \r\nand future generations. In that quest, we must take \r\ninspiration from the words of the “Father of the Indian \r\nNation”, Mahatma Gandhi, who said:\r\n“Whenever you are in doubt ... recall the face \r\nof the poorest and weakest person you may have \r\nseen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is \r\ngoing to be of any use to her. Will she gain anything \r\nby it? Will it restore her to control over her own life \r\nand destiny? ... Then you will find your doubts ... \r\nmelting away”.\r\nMr. Yaroshevich (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe delegation of the Republic of Belarus welcomes \r\nthe results of the negotiations on strengthening the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, which led to the adoption \r\nof resolution 68/1.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council, under whose \r\nauspices meetings of the High-level Political Forum on \r\nThe vision of a strengthened Economic and Social \r\nCouncil has been realized through resolution 68/1, \r\nadopted in September this year. We deeply appreciate \r\nthe efforts of the Permanent Representatives of Guyana \r\nand Belgium for leading the inclusive process of \r\nconsultations that led to the resolution’s adoption. We \r\nbelieve that the strengthened structure of the Economic \r\nand Social Council will assist it in better discharging \r\nits role as a principal body for coordination, policy \r\nreview and dialogue and recommendations on issues of \r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThe High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment that we have created must be seen as a \r\nforum for action-oriented collaboration. The Forum \r\nshould address sustainable development challenges \r\nfrom the perspective of poverty eradication as its \r\noverarching objective. The Council and the Forum will \r\ntogether play a key role in the articulation of global \r\npriorities in the post-2015 period. India believes that \r\npoverty eradication must be pursued with renewed \r\nvigour and determination. Other human development \r\nimperatives enshrined in the MDGs remain equally \r\nimportant and must be carried forward.\r\nOnly economic growth can ensure the eradication \r\nof poverty. To achieve that, we must strengthen \r\nthe partnership between developed and developing \r\ncountries and make it more meaningful and genuine. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda must remain an \r\nagenda for development. Its focal point must be a more \r\nequitable distribution of resources and wealth among \r\nthe nations and within them. It must also promote an \r\ninternational system conducive to development.\r\nIndia has followed a path of inclusive growth, with \r\nthe aim of making all sections of society stakeholders \r\nin the development of the country. Robust economic \r\ngrowth over the past decade, supported by proactive and \r\ntargeted interventions by the Government, has enabled \r\nus to move millions of our people out of poverty.\r\nWe have taken several unique trailblazing \r\ninitiatives. The recently enacted Food Security Act \r\nwill ensure food security for the Indian people. A law \r\nthat guarantees at least a hundred days of work for the \r\ncountry’s rural poor has also been enacted. The Right \r\nto Education Act ensures universal access to quality \r\neducation for our people. The Right to Information \r\nAct has empowered people by enhancing openness \r\nand transparency in governance. We have empowered \r\nwomen by reserving seats for them in local bodies. \r\nWe have strengthened the law dealing with offences \r\n13-55626 7/14\r\n11/11/2013 A/68/PV.50\r\nof the international efforts on the global transition to \r\nsustainable development.\r\nAt the 2013 substantive session of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, it became clear that it would not \r\nbe possible to adopt the ministerial declaration by \r\nconsensus, and we think that it is unacceptable that \r\nindividual States, acting out of sheer political ambition, \r\ncan block the results of a negotiating process. We \r\nbelieve that blocking a declaration, which is a type of \r\nroad map for the economic dimension of the United \r\nNations, should be viewed as an action that impedes \r\nthe full implementation of the United Nations mandate.\r\nA priority task of the Council should, we believe, \r\nremain — in future as well — the implementation \r\nof mutually beneficial cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and international financial and trade \r\ninstitutions, the private sector and non-governmental \r\norganizations for the purposes of ensuring the \r\neffective implementation of the international agenda \r\nfor development. Belarus is prepared to engage in \r\nconstructive cooperation with all partners in the \r\ninterests of a further practical strengthening of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council so as to bring it in line \r\nwith its true role and the functions and to coordinate \r\nsocioeconomic activity, which is part of its mandate \r\nas set by the international community. In addition to \r\nimprovements in the forms and working methods of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, we also expect smoother \r\nand more accurate work from the Secretariat. A decision \r\nto hold the substantive session of the Council in one \r\nplace would contribute to the organization of its work \r\nat a stable, high level.\r\nMr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I would first like to thank the President of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council for his introduction \r\nof the Council’s report (A/68/3). We would also like to \r\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretariat for its support \r\nof the Council’s work in the current year.\r\nThe Russian delegation greatly appreciates the \r\nintensive dialogue on multilateral cooperation in \r\nthe areas of science, technology, innovation and \r\nculture that took place within the framework of the \r\nhigh-level segment of the substantive session of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. The annual ministerial \r\nreview of progress towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) helped to strengthen \r\nmultilateral cooperation in those areas and made a \r\nsignificant contribution to the post-2015 global social \r\nand economic agenda. Most importantly, the members \r\nSustainable Development will be held each year, should \r\nbe the main forum for reviewing the economic, social \r\nand environmental aspects of development issues. Both \r\nthe Council and the Forum are already being called upon \r\nto systematize various processes in the socioeconomic \r\narea and give them centripetal force. That is particularly \r\nrelevant in the short period that remains before the \r\nkey deadline, namely, the approval of a new post-2015 \r\nglobal agenda for sustainable development.\r\nThe outcomes of that process will enable us once \r\nagain to look at the topic of strengthening global \r\neconomic management. In that regard, we would like to \r\nsee more active interaction between the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, the Group of 20 and the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, as they \r\nare among the key international institutions in the \r\neconomic sphere. In addition, we need, in our view, \r\nto continue thinking about implementing in practice \r\nthe oft-repeated proposal of establishing a body on \r\nfinancing for development as a subsidiary body of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nWe also support continuing the practice of holding \r\nhigh-level meetings of the Economic and Social Council \r\non the most relevant issues of the world economy and \r\nfinance, in which the leaders of the Bretton Woods \r\ninstitutions, the World Trade Organization, the \r\nInternational Labour Organization, the United Nations \r\nIndustrial Development Organization and others \r\nwould participate. We also urge that those meetings \r\nseek to develop practical steps aimed at ensuring the \r\nsustainability of the world economy as a whole and \r\nnational economies in particular.\r\nAnother area that the Council and the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum could focus on extensively is to \r\nmonitoring of the implementation of commitments in \r\nthe area of financing for development. We propose that \r\nthe modalities for that aspect of the Forum’s work should \r\nbe determined at the Forum session to be convened \r\nunder the auspices of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nBelarus believes that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil can and should become a structure that is \r\nable to develop concrete steps to implement the many \r\ndeclarations adopted on various topics in the social, \r\neconomic and environmental spheres. In that regard, \r\nwe commend the exchange of views that took place in \r\nthe margins of the substantive session of the Economic \r\nand Social Council in 2013 on issues of cooperation \r\nwith middle-income level countries; without their \r\nparticipation we cannot begin talking about the success \r\n8/14 13-55626\r\nA/68/PV.50 11/11/2013\r\nIn 2013, the Economic and Social Council \r\nsolidified its key role in the intergovernmental \r\nfinancing-for-development follow-up process to the \r\noutcome of the International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development. We welcome the results of the special \r\nhigh-level meeting of the Council with the Bretton \r\nWoods institutions, the World Trade Organization \r\nand the United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment. We particularly value the efforts of the \r\nPresident and the Bureau of the Council to establish \r\nworking relationships with the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank. We consider it one of the \r\nCouncil’s primary strategic objectives to build mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe international financial and trade institutions, the \r\nprivate sector and non-governmental organizations in \r\nthe interests of effectively realizing the international \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council also remains \r\nan important forum for the discussion of current \r\nproblems of international cooperation in the area of \r\nhealth care, including combating non-communicable \r\ndiseases. On Russia’s initiative, the Council adopted \r\nresolution 2013/12, on forming a United Nations \r\nInteragency Task force on the Prevention and Control \r\nof Non-communicable Diseases, which brings the \r\nwork of the United Nations system in that area to \r\na qualitatively new level and makes an important \r\ncontribution to implementing the General Assembly’s \r\nPolitical Declaration on the Prevention and Control \r\nof Non-communicable Diseases (resolution 66/2) and \r\nthe related Global Action Plan. We are grateful to all \r\nthe delegations that supported the draft resolution, \r\nparticularly in the capacity of co-sponsors.\r\nRussia has consistently advocated for strengthening \r\nthe coordinating role of the Economic and Social Council \r\nin the United Nations development system. The Council \r\nremains a key United Nations forum for developing \r\ncollective approaches to solving urgent social and \r\neconomic problems. We participated actively in the \r\nagreement on General Assembly resolutions 67/290 and \r\n68/1, which defined new parameters for the Council’s \r\nwork, taking into account the tasks outlined in the \r\noutcome document of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\non the balanced integration of the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental pillars of sustainable development. We \r\nare awaiting substantive proposals from the Council’s \r\nBureau and the United Nations Secretariat on the \r\norganization of the Council’s work in the new format.\r\nof the Economic and Social Council called unanimously \r\nfor agreement on a single programme of action based on \r\nthe concept of sustainable development with a limited \r\nset of goals, targets and indicators.\r\nDiscussions in the framework of the Economic \r\nand Social Council emphasized convincingly that \r\nbuilding scientific, technological and cultural potential \r\nshould be considered a priority and a key prerequisite \r\nfor overcoming the legacy of the global financial and \r\neconomic crisis and for implementing international \r\ndevelopment goals as quickly as possible. We believe \r\nthat the Council has succeeded in creating a good \r\nfoundation for initiating multilateral scientific, \r\ntechnological and cultural cooperation and in \r\nestablishing the right guidelines for further efforts, at \r\nevery level, to encourage the effective use of science, \r\ntechnology, innovation and culture in achieving the \r\nMDGs. We look forward to seeing a speedy conclusion \r\nto the drafting of a ministerial declaration and its \r\nadoption during the resumed substantive session in \r\nDecember. We support the efforts of the President of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council to achieve consensus \r\non the remaining unresolved issue.\r\nThe annual ministerial reviews within the \r\nEconomic and Social Council have demonstrated the \r\nCouncil’s unique potential for effective monitoring \r\nand control of the comprehensive and coordinated \r\nimplementation of the decisions of the major United \r\nNations socioeconomic forums. It will therefore be \r\nessential to set up the work of the High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development, which as of \r\n2016 will replace the ministerial reviews, by taking \r\ninto account the successes of the annual ministerial \r\nreview experience, which include the open nature of \r\ndiscussions, a clear thematic focus and reliance on the \r\nexpertise of relevant United Nations entities, academia, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and the private sector.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council has made a \r\nmajor contribution to achieving the policy orientations \r\noutlined in General Assembly resolution 67/226, on the \r\nquadrennial comprehensive policy review of United \r\nNations operational activities. We are convinced that \r\nimproving operational efficiency should remain a \r\npriority for the Council, which is mandated to monitor \r\nprogress in implementing the relevant Assembly \r\ndecisions. In that context, ensuring that the analytical \r\nreporting of the agencies concerned is of the appropriate \r\nquality is extremely important, and we urge that \r\nparticular attention be paid to the issue.\r\n13-55626 9/14\r\n11/11/2013 A/68/PV.50\r\nPakistan and the Sudan — and the Secretariat for their \r\nhard and fruitful work.\r\nIn 2013, the Republic of Kyrgyzstan participated \r\nin the activities of the Economic and Social Council as \r\na full member for the first time. My country’s decision \r\nto stand for election to the Council was the result of a \r\ndesire to take part in multilateral efforts to find ways \r\nto achieve sustainable development while taking into \r\naccount the specifics of our socioeconomic makeup, the \r\npotential of our natural resources, and our geographic \r\nfeatures. We also considered it essential to consolidate \r\nthe efforts of all countries aimed at developing concrete \r\nrecommendations to solve problems of socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment on the basis of an objective and fair \r\nconsideration of their interests and needs.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic considers the Economic \r\nand Social Council to be an important platform \r\nfor multilateral political dialogue that enables its \r\nparticipants to present their national achievements, \r\nexchange valuable experiences, discuss existing and \r\nemerging issues and jointly develop ideas for the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nresults of the work of the Economic and Social Council \r\nin 2013.\r\nWe note the Council’s many important and \r\ninnovative endeavours aimed at coordinating United \r\nNations activities in the economic, social, environmental \r\nand other related areas, and we welcome the holding of \r\nthe special joint meeting of the Council and the Second \r\nCommittee of the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh \r\nsession, which allowed us to engage in wide-ranging \r\ndiscussions on the issues of food security and nutrition. \r\nThe discussion at the special high-level meeting of the \r\nCouncil with the Bretton Woods institutions, the World \r\nTrade Organization and the United Nations Conference \r\non Trade and Development was also fruitful for \r\nreviewing the current situation and the outlook for the \r\nfuture. The First Deputy Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz \r\nRepublic spoke at that high-level meeting on the global \r\neconomic situation.\r\nThe debt-burden problem is one of the main \r\nreasons why many developing countries will be unable \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\non schedule. We therefore support the idea of holding \r\na special meeting on external debt sustainability and \r\ndevelopment. We also found fruitful the discussion of \r\ncoordination, operational activities and humanitarian \r\nissues at the 2013 substantive session of the Economic \r\nand Social Council in Geneva.\r\nWe urge that priority be given to ensuring the \r\nuninterrupted functioning of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil’s subsidiary bodies, particularly during the \r\nso-called transitional period. We also presume that, \r\nin preparing their proposals, the Bureau and the \r\nSecretariat will take full account of resolution 67/290, \r\nwhich clearly defines the modalities of the High-level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development under the \r\nauspices of the Economic and Social Council. We affirm \r\nthe understanding reached during the consultations \r\nthat the Forum will meet within the framework of the \r\nsubstantive session of the Council for eight consecutive \r\ndays, including three days at the ministerial level. We \r\nalso believe that it is exceedingly important to avoid \r\ncompetition between the annual ministerial review and \r\nthe High-level Political Forum during the transitional \r\nperiod. The outcome of the high-level segment of the \r\nCouncil’s substantive session should be expressed in a \r\nsingle ministerial declaration.\r\nWe note that changes will soon have to be made in \r\nthe Economic and Social Council’s rules of procedure \r\nin accordance with the provisions of resolution 68/1. \r\nWe also consider it important to continue to work on \r\noptimizing the Council’s agenda and its modalities \r\nof working with non-governmental organizations and \r\nthe private sector while maintaining the Council’s \r\ninter-State nature. In that regard, we would like to \r\nemphasize that decisions on those and other issues are \r\nthe exclusive prerogative of Member States.\r\nThe Russian delegation has an interest in ensuring \r\nthe efficient functioning of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, which is mandated to play an important role in \r\ncoordinating and implementing the new priorities of the \r\npost-2015 social and economic agenda. We believe that \r\nthe Council should take its rightful place in creating \r\nthe emerging global architecture for international \r\ndevelopment cooperation, and we are ready to contribute \r\nin every possible way to a constructive dialogue with \r\nall our partners.\r\nMr. Niyazaliev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would like to thank the President of the Economic \r\nand Social Council for his thorough introduction of \r\nthe report on the work of the Council for the preceding \r\nperiod (A/68/3). My delegation welcomes the report and \r\ngreatly appreciates the skilful leadership of the Council \r\nby Mr. Néstor Osorio, the Ambassador of Colombia. I \r\nwould also like to thank the members of the Bureau of \r\nthe Council — the Ambassadors of Austria, Albania, \r\n10/14 13-55626\r\nA/68/PV.50 11/11/2013\r\non the theme for the year, which should be issued in \r\nconsultation with the subsidiary bodies and Member \r\nStates.\r\nWe believe that the annual theme of the Economic \r\nand Social Council should reflect the ongoing process of \r\ndefining the post-2015 sustainable development goals. \r\nWe are ready to actively participate in those efforts. We \r\nare carrying out national consultations on the priority \r\nissues of the development agenda: the eradication of \r\npoverty, access to education and health care, ensuring a \r\nsustainable economy and employment, the development \r\nof agriculture, food security, energy, governance, peace \r\nand stability.\r\nWe also believe that particular attention must be \r\npaid to the specific needs of States that have a special \r\ngeographical situation, especially those which are the \r\nmost economically vulnerable, such as developing \r\ncountries, landlocked developing countries, small \r\nisland developing countries and mountainous countries. \r\nThere are a few landlocked mountainous countries, \r\nwhich have specific developmental needs, including \r\ntransport infrastructure, energy vulnerability, issues of \r\nclimate change and the melting of glaciers. We believe \r\nthat those specific needs should be taken into account \r\nin the work of Economic and Social Council.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to emphasize that the \r\nKyrgyz Republic attaches great importance to the \r\nactivities of the Economic and Social Council and \r\nis determined to ensure the implementation of its \r\nresolutions, as well as the decisions of its subordinate \r\nbodies, with a view to strengthening coordination and \r\ncooperation aimed at achieving development goals.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): At the outset, I wish to \r\nconvey my condolences to the Government of the \r\nPhilippines over the tragic event brought on by Typhoon \r\nHaiyan.\r\nI wish to thank you, Mr. President, for holding \r\nthis joint debate. I also would like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for the reports \r\nsubmitted under these agenda items (A/67/736, A/68/3 \r\nand A/68/229).\r\nImproving the quality of life of a growing \r\npopulation in a sustainable manner remains the most \r\nurgent development priority for the international \r\ncommunity. However, pursuing poverty eradication \r\nand sustainable development together is a formidable \r\nchallenge, both for national Governments and for the \r\nmultilateral system. The world is changing rapidly and \r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the Assembly’s \r\nadoption on 20 September of resolution 68/1, aimed \r\nat strengthening the role and effectiveness of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. The adoption of that \r\nresolution was the result of strenuous joint efforts \r\non the part of delegations, under the able leadership \r\nof the representatives of Belgium and Guyana as \r\nco-facilitators of the review of the implementation of \r\nresolution 61/16 on the strengthening of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. We hope that resolution 68/1 \r\nwill increase the effectiveness, focus and coherence \r\nof the work of the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nprincipal organ responsible for coordination, policy \r\nreview and dialogue on issues of economic and social \r\ndevelopment, as well as for the achievement of the \r\ninternational development goals. We are confident that \r\nthe Council will be able to ensure a coordinated follow-\r\nup to the major international conferences and high-level \r\nmeetings and to facilitate a balanced integration of all \r\nthree components of sustainable development.\r\nIn that connection, we welcome the adoption of \r\nresolution 67/290, entitled “Format and organizational \r\naspects of the high-level political forum on sustainable \r\ndevelopment”. It is an additional contribution to efforts \r\nto strengthen the role of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil as one of the main tools for the effective \r\nimplementation of the decisions of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development. We hope \r\nthat the strengthened Council will be an important \r\nmechanism in implementing the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and will continue to serve as an important \r\nplatform for multilateral political dialogue on global \r\nissues of social and economic development.\r\nAllow me to emphasize the crucial importance of \r\nstrengthening the coordination and interaction between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. We need to undertake joint efforts to ensure \r\nthat the efforts of those two main United Nations organs \r\nare mutually beneficial and reinforcing and avoid \r\nduplication. That will increase the effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations in ensuring a more secure, equitable \r\nand prosperous future.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic supports the thematic \r\napproach adopted by the Economic and Social Council \r\nin its work. However, the themes chosen must be cross-\r\ncutting and appropriately reflected in the work of the \r\nsubsidiary bodies of the Council. In accordance with \r\nresolution 68/1, we are anxiously awaiting the proposals \r\nof the President of the Economic and Social Council \r\n13-55626 11/14\r\n11/11/2013 A/68/PV.50\r\nInstitutional coherence depends to a large degree \r\non the quality of interaction among intergovernmental \r\nbodies. The activities of the High-Level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development, established in \r\naccordance with the Rio+20 outcome document, should \r\ncomplement the work of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. The Forum should benefit from the strengths \r\nof the Economic and Social Council, as decided in \r\nparagraph 84 of the outcome document, which states \r\nthat the Forum “should avoid overlap with existing \r\nstructures, bodies and entities in a cost-effective \r\nmanner”. There should also be coherence between the \r\nthemes addressed by the Economic and Social Council \r\nand those addressed by the High-Level Political Forum.\r\nThe ongoing global financial and economic crisis \r\nreversed much of the world’s economic growth and \r\nbadly affected much-needed development, particularly \r\nin the developing countries. The crisis has threatened \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) by 2015. Against that backdrop, Malaysia \r\nhas, at the national level, adopted forward-looking \r\nmacroeconomic policies through the tenth Malaysia \r\nPlan, which is aimed at delivering high economic \r\ngrowth in a sustained, inclusive and equitable manner \r\nin order to ensure that Malaysia is on track to become a \r\nhigh-income nation by 2020.\r\nAt the global level, Malaysia will continue to \r\nshare its knowledge and experience in economic and \r\nsocial development with other countries, especially the \r\nleast-developed countries, through capacity-building \r\ninitiatives conducted under the Malaysian Technical \r\nCooperation Programme and other similar initiatives, \r\nin conjunction with development partners, including \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMalaysia is also of the view that efforts to \r\neradicate extreme poverty should form the overarching \r\ngoal of the post-2015 development agenda. That \r\nmust be complemented by improved access to basic \r\ninfrastructure. In addition, equal priority should be \r\ngiven to improving access to basic services. Towards \r\nthat end, our partners from the developed countries \r\ncan continue to assist in poverty-eradication efforts \r\nin the developing world by continuing to fulfil their \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) commitments. \r\nWhile we recognize that our partners might be facing \r\neconomic difficulties back home, we are confident that \r\nsuch difficulties will not hinder them from fulfilling \r\ntheir ODA commitments, as agreed in many United \r\nNations forums.\r\nis confronted by economic, social and environmental \r\nchallenges that cannot be addressed effectively \r\nwithout enhanced international cooperation. As \r\nrecognized by world leaders at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), \r\nthere is a need for effective multilateralism and \r\nefficient intergovernmental arrangements, including a \r\nstrengthened Economic and Social Council.\r\nIn the outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), \r\nentitled “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, annex), \r\nworld leaders envisioned an enhanced multilateral \r\nsystem that could better address the global challenges \r\nof sustainable development. Within the framework of \r\nthe review of the implementation of resolution 61/16, \r\nMember States deliberated extensively, through a \r\nseries of consultations, on how to make the Economic \r\nand Social Council more relevant and came up with \r\nspecific recommendations, which were captured in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/67/736).\r\nIn line with the recommendations in the report, \r\non 20 September the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 68/1, containing the most far-reaching \r\nreforms of Economic and Social Council since 1991. \r\nMalaysia believes that that reform process will make \r\nthe Economic and Social Council a stronger, more \r\nissues-oriented body, responsive to the mounting global \r\neconomic, social and environmental pressures. The \r\nEconomic and Social Council can be either a bystander \r\nor an active intergovernmental body that engages \r\nMember States and other stakeholders in deliberating \r\nand contributing to an effective and timely multilateral \r\nresponse addressing immediate demands and longer-\r\nterm development needs.\r\nStrengthening the Economic and Social Council \r\nwill require a significant transformation and an overhaul \r\nof its working methods. The expected emphasis of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda on sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which will be universally applied, will \r\nhave a significant bearing on how the global partnership \r\nfor development should be reoriented. The principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities should be \r\nupheld by all Member States and the United Nations \r\nsystem in implementing the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Ensuring that an internationally agreed post-\r\n2015 development agenda is followed by effective \r\naction will require international institutions to adapt \r\nto the increasingly global, multidimensional and \r\ninterconnected nature of development challenges.\r\n12/14 13-55626\r\nA/68/PV.50 11/11/2013\r\nwhich will meet under the auspices of both the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council. That \r\nwill enable greater prominence and political visibility \r\nof the sustainable development issue on the United \r\nNations agenda. We view the Forum as a high-level \r\nplatform for the implementation and monitoring of the \r\nsustainable development goals.\r\nWe are pleased that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil reform package endorsed the Council’s key \r\nrole in achieving balanced integration among all three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development. An integration \r\nsegment will help to coordinate the activities of \r\nMember States and all United Nations bodies with the \r\naim of achieving the goal of improving cooperation and \r\ncoordination throughout the United Nations system.\r\nWe also wish to stress the importance of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council in supervising \r\noperational activities related to development. Through \r\nthe operational activities segment, the Council should \r\ncontinue to provide overall coordination and guidance \r\nfor operational development funds and programmes \r\nand assist them in their preparations for the quadrennial \r\npolicy review of operational activities at the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine would like to underscore \r\nthe enhanced relevance of the humanitarian affairs \r\nsegment of the Economic and Social Council, which \r\nhas made an important contribution to the improved \r\ncoordination and effectiveness of the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian assistance effort.\r\nThe Economic and Social Council reform package \r\nacknowledges the importance of the regional dimension \r\nof sustainable development and the enhanced role \r\nof United Nations regional commissions. In that \r\nregard, we would like to highlight the outcome of the \r\nreview of the reform of the United Nations Economic \r\nCommission for Europe (UNECE), which was endorsed \r\nby the Economic and Social Council at the substantive \r\nsession in July. The results of the review suggest that \r\nthe Commission met the expectations of its member \r\nStates and proved its ability to keep pace with the times \r\nand address the challenges facing the UNECE region.\r\nWhile stressing the various valuable achievements, \r\nwe must not forget to proceed with unfinished business, \r\nin particular in such areas as the Council’s working \r\nmodalities, final agenda and main themes. In the run-\r\nup to 2015, it is essential to ensure that the transition \r\nperiod in the Council’s work does not take up much \r\nThe 2010 MDG review showed that Malaysia \r\nhas achieved or is on track to attain the MDGs at the \r\naggregate level by 2015. The latest figures show that the \r\npoverty rate in Malaysia has decreased to 1.7 per cent. \r\nJust last year, 63,147 poor households were elevated \r\nunder the 1AZAM programme, a hard-core poverty-\r\neradication programme of the Malaysian Government.\r\nIn order to plan, implement and monitor poverty-\r\neradication programmes, Malaysia introduced a \r\nmonitoring system called e-Kasih in November 2007. \r\nE-Kasih was awarded first prize in the 2012 United \r\nNations Public Service Awards, in recognition of its \r\nsignificant contribution to poverty eradication. The \r\ne-Kasih database system was created at the national \r\nlevel to collect data on poor families in Malaysia. The \r\ndatabase allows for the fair distribution of assistance \r\nand avoiding overlaps in aid programmes carried out by \r\nmultiple Government agencies.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming Malaysia’s \r\ncommitment to implementing the outcomes of the \r\nmajor United Nations conferences in the economic, \r\nsocial and related fields by pursuing a development \r\npolicy framework focused on high growth through \r\nsustained, inclusive and equitable economic, social and \r\nenvironmental policies and guided by the principles \r\nand objectives of sustainable development.\r\nMr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): The strengthening of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council is clearly interlinked \r\nwith the overall reform of the United Nations sustainable \r\ndevelopment architecture. We must therefore take a \r\nconsistent approach to the implementation of resolution \r\n68/1, on the strengthening of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and of resolution 67/290, on the format and \r\norganizational aspects of the high-level political forum \r\non sustainable development, as they represent major \r\nsteps forward in the implementation of the commitments \r\nmade at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nThere is a need for synergy among the High-\r\nLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the General \r\nAssembly, so as to enable an integrated consideration \r\nof sustainable development in the run-up to 2015. In \r\nthat regard, we encourage close collaboration between \r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Bureau of the Second and Third Committees. \r\nUkraine recognizes the enhanced status of the High-\r\nLevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \r\n13-55626 13/14\r\n11/11/2013 A/68/PV.50\r\nsteps and measures indicated in the resolution should \r\npromote the role of the Economic and Social Council as \r\nthe central mechanism in coordinating the activities of \r\nthe United Nations system and its specialized agencies \r\nand in overseeing the subsidiary bodies in economic, \r\nsocial and environmental fields in order to promote the \r\nwork of the Council and allow it to achieve its goals and \r\nfulfil its responsibilities.\r\nThe obstacles and challenges confronting the \r\ninternational community are preventing developing \r\ncountries from attaining the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), and that makes us care more deeply \r\nabout supporting the work of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil as the primary international instrument \r\nconcerned with socioeconomic development in order \r\nto provide a life in conditions of dignity, which is \r\nexemplified above all by guaranteeing the well-being \r\nand welfare of nations, raising living standards, \r\ncombating abject poverty and hunger, and promoting \r\nefforts to reduce poverty in developing countries as a \r\nmain pillar of the basic values of the United Nations\r\nWe would like to highlight the difficulties of the \r\ncoming phase, which will require all of us to work \r\nharder to implement the outcome of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development and turn it \r\ninto concrete reality, especially in terms of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the environment, climate change and \r\nan integrated economic vision for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We would like to \r\nemphasize the need to develop and promote partnership \r\namong all the main bodies of the United Nations, in \r\nparticular between the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the General Assembly.\r\nThe attainment of development in its three pillars \r\nof economic growth, social development and the \r\nprotection of the environment and its natural resources \r\nrequires a holistic vision for devising strategies for \r\nsustainable development that focus closely on all three \r\npillars without shortchanging future generations. To \r\nthat end, we must uphold solidarity among generations \r\nand between Government and non-Government \r\norganizations. In that context, the State of Kuwait \r\nestablished a reserve fund for future generations in 1976 \r\nand has set aside 10 per cent of its oil and other revenues \r\nfor that purpose. Recently, a decision was made to \r\nincrease that set-aside to 25 per cent, so that the reserve \r\nfund could achieve the necessary balance between \r\npreserving State revenues and creating a development \r\nstrategy for current and future generations.\r\ntime. It is therefore crucial that we act with a sense of \r\nurgency.\r\nOf no less importance to the smooth working of the \r\nstrengthened Economic and Social Council is ensuring \r\nthat it is adequately assisted by the Secretariat. In \r\nthat regard, we look forward to the proposals from \r\nthe Secretary-General on measures to enable the \r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs to better \r\nsupport the unified development agenda and the \r\nCouncil.\r\nAs we enter the implementation phase, it is up to \r\nMember States to successfully translate into practice \r\nthe provisions of resolutions 67/290 and 68/1. In so \r\ndoing, we must not lose sight of the ultimate goal of the \r\nreform of the Economic and Social Council, namely, to \r\nensure that the Council remains a principal body with \r\nsufficient authority to make decisions on global social \r\nand economic affairs and to improve its ability to fulfil \r\nthe tasks assigned to it under the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nFor its part, Ukraine has always attached great \r\nimportance to strengthening the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil. Commitment to an effective, efficient and \r\ntransparent Council was a cornerstone of Ukraine’s \r\ntenure in that body from 2010 to 2012. It is in that spirit \r\nthat we intend to serve on the Council again, if elected \r\nto its membership for the 2019-2021 term.\r\nMr. Al-Adwani (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to emphasize the keen interest of \r\nour delegation in participating in the consideration of \r\none of the most important items on the agenda of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, “Report of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil”. I would also like to express my gratitude and \r\nappreciation to all Member States for their support of \r\nthe candidacy of Kuwait in the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil elections of November 2012, which resulted in \r\nour obtaining the honour of membership on the Council \r\nfor 2013-2015, a crowning achievement of our efforts \r\nin the economic, social and environmental arenas. \r\nWe also express our gratitude to the States members \r\nof the Economic and Social Council for their efforts \r\nand contributions in overcoming the main obstacles in \r\norder to achieve effective engagement and participation \r\nby the Economic and Social Council throughout the \r\nprevious session.\r\nHere we would particularly like to commend the \r\nadoption in September of resolution 68/1, concerning \r\nreform of the Economic and Social Council. The \r\n14/14 13-55626\r\nA/68/PV.50 11/11/2013\r\nand Social Council and its subsidiary bodies. We also \r\npay special attention to the activities of the Economic \r\nand Social Council in order to promote economic \r\ncooperation with a view to accelerating development \r\nand achieving our common goals of combating poverty, \r\neliminating serious and infectious diseases, and \r\nachieving sustainable development. We also continue to \r\nsupport international and regional institutions working \r\nin the area of development in order to enable them to \r\ncarry out their tasks and pursue their efforts, thereby \r\nsupporting and assisting developing and less-developed \r\ncountries to achieve the MDGs.\r\nTo conclude, we look forward to submitting our \r\nvoluntary national report at the coming substantive \r\nsession of the Economic and Social Council, to be held \r\nin New York next year, which will cover the progress \r\nachieved by Kuwait in reaching the MDGs.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on agenda items 9 and 14. The Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of those \r\nagenda items.\r\nAgenda item 118 (continued)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Summit\r\nSpecific meeting focused on development\r\nThe President: I have been informed that no \r\nMember State has requested to take the f loor under that \r\nitem.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 118.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.20 a.m.\r\nThe assistance provided over five decades by the \r\nState of Kuwait via the Kuwait Development Fund \r\nhas been linked to economic and social development \r\nand has increased standards of living and employment \r\nopportunities in beneficiary States. The most important \r\naspect of that assistance is that it is provided on easy \r\nterms, without conditions, and that its purpose is to \r\nassist others in ensuring their own welfare. It is also \r\na chance to promote friendship and common interests \r\nbetween Kuwait and recipient countries, which \r\ncurrently number more than 100 States, with a total \r\nassistance of more than $18 billion.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has also continued to promote \r\ninitiatives calling for the creation of special funds \r\ncovering various regions in the world and addressing \r\nenvironmental, economic, educational, health and \r\ndevelopment issues, with the aim of resolving the \r\nproblems of unemployment, food security and other \r\nchallenges facing the peoples of the developing world. \r\nThose funds include the Fund for a Decent Life, the \r\nFund for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and the \r\nSpecial Fund for Asian States, which was created at the \r\nsuggestion of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait, Sheikh \r\nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, and is sponsored \r\nby him in the context of the Asian Cooperation Dialogue, \r\nthrough which the State of Kuwait has contributed \r\n$300 million to the Fund.\r\nThe State of Kuwait was eager to support \r\nefforts aimed at achieving sustainable development, \r\novercoming poverty and making use of the accumulated \r\ninternational experience and expertise in order to \r\nidentify its priorities and scope in the economic \r\nsocial and environmental fields. The State of Kuwait \r\nis therefore fully committed to the implementation of \r\nthe resolutions and policies adopted by the Economic \r\n"
