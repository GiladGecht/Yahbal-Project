Ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now be \r\ndistributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to one of the \r\nfive regional groups and has the corresponding number \r\nof blank lines for the seats assigned to that region.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot \r\npapers and to write on them the names of the States \r\nfor which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing \r\nmore names from the relevant region than the number \r\nof seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. A \r\nballot will also be declared invalid if all the names of \r\nthe Member States on that ballot do not belong to the \r\nrelevant region. If a ballot paper of a region includes \r\nboth the names of Member States that belong to and \r\nthat are from outside of that region, the ballot remains \r\nvalid but only the names of the Member States that \r\nbelong to the relevant region will be counted. If a ballot \r\npaper contains names of Member States that are not \r\neligible for re-election or that are currently members of \r\nthe Council, the ballot remains valid, but those names \r\nwill not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr. Hawezy (Iraq), \r\nMs. Johnson (Jamaica), Mr. Isakov (Kyrgyzstan), \r\nMs. Cortes Palma (Portugal), Mr. Fawundu (Sierra \r\nLeone), Mrs. Kramberger Mendek (Slovenia), \r\nMr. Tazo (Togo) and Ms. Özaydın (Turkey) acted as \r\ntellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.25 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 193\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 192\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSouth Africa 169\r\nAlgeria 164\r\nMorocco 163\r\nNamibia 150\r\nStates have obtained the votes of the majority of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly on the same ballot, those \r\nMember States that have obtained the largest number \r\nof votes above the required majority will be considered \r\nas elected, up to the number of seats to be filled.\r\nAlso, consistent with past practice, in case, due to \r\na tie vote, it should become necessary to determine one \r\ncandidate to be elected or that will proceed to the next \r\nround of restricted balloting, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Accordingly, the election shall be \r\nheld by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nAgain, I should like to repeat that the 14 vacant \r\nseats are to be filled from among the regional groups as \r\nfollows: four seats from among the African States; four \r\nseats from among the Asia-Pacific States; two seats \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States; two seats \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States; \r\nand two seats from among the Western European and \r\nother States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nIn addition, I have been informed by the Secretariat \r\nthat voluntary pledges and commitments made by \r\nMember States in accordance with paragraph 8 of \r\nresolution 60/251 were accordingly issued as official \r\ndocuments of the sixty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on \r\nthe actual conduct of the voting.\r\nIn addition, ballot papers will be given only to \r\nthe representative seated directly behind the country’s \r\nnameplate.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time when the General \r\nAssembly is conducting the elections.\r\nPlease be reminded that during the voting \r\nprocedure, all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. That means that, once the meeting has \r\nbegun, no more campaign material can be distributed \r\ninside the Hall.\r\n13-55771 3/3\r\n12/11/2013 A/68/PV.51\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCuba 148\r\nMexico 135\r\nUruguay 93\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 192\r\nAbstentions: 14\r\nNumber of members voting: 178\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nFrance 174\r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland 171\r\nAndorra 1\r\nGreece 1\r\nLuxembourg 1\r\nPortugal 1\r\nSan Marino 1\r\nHaving obtained the required majority and the \r\nlargest number of votes of the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the following 14 States were \r\nelected members of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor a three-year term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2014: Algeria, China, Cuba, France, \r\nMaldives, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, the Russian \r\nFederation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nand Viet Nam.\r\nThe President: I congratulate those States that \r\nhave been elected members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (c) of agenda item 115.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.30 a.m. \r\nSouth Sudan 89\r\nTunisia 2\r\nGroup B — Asian States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 193\r\nAbstentions: 1\r\nNumber of members voting: 192\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nViet Nam 184\r\nChina 176\r\nMaldives 164\r\nSaudi Arabia 140\r\nJordan 16\r\nIslamic Republic of Iran 1\r\nSingapore 1\r\nThailand 1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 193\r\nAbstentions: 2\r\nNumber of members voting: 191\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nFormer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 177\r\nRussian Federation 176\r\nLatvia 1\r\nSlovakia 1\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 193\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting: 193\r\nRequired absolute majority: 97\r\n"
