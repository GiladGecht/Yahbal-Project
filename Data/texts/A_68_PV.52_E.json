Those dialogues \r\nwere held at the initiative of the countries concerned \r\nthemselves, which were welcomed by the Council for \r\ntheir commitment and willingness to address serious \r\nhuman rights concerns in an international forum.\r\nA number of other country-specific resolutions \r\nwere also adopted within the framework of technical \r\ncooperation and capacity-building, including on \r\nCambodia, the Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Haiti, \r\nLibya, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan and \r\nYemen.\r\nAt this juncture, I should highlight the important \r\nrole of the regular update, at the beginning of each \r\nCouncil session, by the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights on developments in the world and \r\nthe numerous reports presented, including on Mali, \r\nGuinea, Afghanistan, Libya, Colombia, Guatemala, \r\nBolivia, Cyprus, Iran, Sri Lanka and Yemen, among \r\nothers, which have tremendously contributed to the \r\ndeliberations of the Council.\r\nDuring its past three regular sessions, among other \r\ndebates, the Council held a total of 13 panel discussions \r\non themes such as the impact of corruption on human \r\nrights, the contribution of parliaments to the work of the \r\nCouncil and its universal periodic review, business and \r\nhuman rights, democracy and the rule of law, the human \r\nrights of children of parents sentenced to the death \r\npenalty or executed, gender integration, indigenous \r\npeoples, the rights of children, and the rights of persons \r\nwith disabilities, as well as the promotion of technical \r\ncooperation in the area of the administration of justice.\r\nThe Council also held high-level panel discussions \r\nto mark the twentieth anniversary of the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action, during which \r\nwe heard a video address by the Secretary-General. \r\nThe discussion focused on the implementation of the \r\nVienna Declaration and a review of the achievements, \r\nbest practices and challenges in that regard. In \r\naddition, this year’s high-level panel on human rights \r\nmainstreaming, with heads and the senior officials of \r\nUnited Nations agencies, focused on human rights and \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, with a particular \r\nAgenda item 64\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/68/53 \r\nand Add.1)\r\nThe President: The addendum to the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council covering the Council’s twenty-\r\nfourth session, held from 9 to 27 September 2013, is \r\ncurrently available in English only on the Council’s \r\nwebsite. The addendum will be circulated in all \r\nlanguages as soon as the translations are completed.\r\nIn connection with this item, I would like to recall \r\nthat the General Assembly, at its 2nd plenary meeting, \r\non 20 September 2013, decided to consider agenda item \r\n64 in the plenary meeting and in the Third Committee, \r\npursuant to resolution 65/281 of 17 June 2011.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 65/281 of 17 June \r\n2011, I now give the f loor to Mr. Remigiusz Achilles \r\nHenczel,  President of the Human Rights Council.\r\nMr. Henczel (Poland), President of the Human \r\nRights Council: It is with great pleasure and honour that \r\nI come before the General Assembly today to introduce \r\nthe annual report of the Human Rights Council (A/68/53 \r\nand Add.1) to the Assembly. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate the newly elected members \r\nof the Council and to wish them a successful term.\r\nThe year 2013 marks the seventh year since the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council, which has \r\nachieved significant progress in dealing with human \r\nrights issues in different parts of the world.\r\nSyria continued to be high on the agenda of the \r\nCouncil throughout the year, and the mandate of the \r\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry on \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic was extended again. The \r\nCouncil also established a commission of inquiry \r\nto investigate the systematic, widespread and grave \r\nviolations of human rights in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, with a view to ensuring full \r\naccountability, in particular where those violations \r\nmay amount to crimes against humanity. The Council \r\nalso extended existing special procedures mandates on \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Myanmar, \r\nIran, Belarus and Eritrea.\r\nI would like to underline the creativity \r\ndemonstrated by the Council with regard to its methods \r\nof work, which has greatly facilitated the dialogue of \r\ncountries concerned with the Council. Two interactive \r\n4/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nor groups that cooperate or have cooperated with the \r\nUnited Nations and its representatives are unacceptable \r\nand must end.\r\nIt is the Council’s and its President’s responsibility to \r\naddress in an effective manner all cases of intimidation \r\nor reprisal and to ensure unhindered access to all who \r\nseek to cooperate with United Nations mechanisms. In \r\nthat regard, Human Rights Council resolution 24/24, \r\non cooperation with the United Nations in the field \r\nof human rights, adopted last September, is of the \r\nutmost importance. It requests the Secretary-General, \r\nin cooperation with the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), to \r\ndesignate a United Nations-wide senior focal point \r\non reprisals and aims at promoting the prevention of, \r\nprotection against and accountability for reprisals and \r\nintimidation related to cooperation with the United \r\nNations.\r\nI am also pleased to inform the Assembly that \r\nwe have made some progress on the issue of making \r\nthe work of the Council accessible to persons with \r\ndisabilities pursuant to the legal obligations arising \r\nfrom the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities and in line with the mandate given to the \r\nCouncil’s task force on the issue. At every session of the \r\nCouncil, in addition to the annual panel on the rights of \r\npersons with disabilities, one panel was made accessible \r\nto disabled persons. At the most recent session of the \r\nCouncil in September, for example, the annual panel \r\non the rights of indigenous peoples, which focused \r\non the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, was \r\nmade accessible to persons with disabilities through the \r\nprovision of international sign language interpretation, \r\ncaptioning and a webcast of the session. We at the \r\nCouncil remain committed through the task force to \r\nshare best practices on accessibility. The task force will \r\ncontinue to report to the Council on progress on the \r\nissue.\r\nLet me now make a few remarks relating to \r\nthe universal periodic review. We are now firmly \r\nengaged in the second cycle of the UPR, and the \r\nprocess continues to receive positive feedback from all \r\nstakeholders involved. However, I must point out that \r\nwe have faced a number of challenges in, for example, \r\nupholding the principle of universality by ensuring the \r\nparticipation of all States and in avoiding that issues \r\nof a bilateral, territorial nature have a negative impact \r\non the process. Furthermore, it is my firm conviction \r\nthat, by applying all existing practices and rules in a \r\nfocus on the right to education. The participation of \r\nthe Secretary-General in the panel demonstrated his \r\ncommitment to ensuring the integration of human rights \r\nin development efforts. The panels held throughout the \r\nyear benefitted from the expertise and perspectives of \r\npanellists, including representatives of Governments, \r\nparliaments, human rights mechanisms, international \r\nand regional organizations, academia, civil society \r\nrepresenting affected communities, United Nations \r\nagencies and journalists.\r\nFinally, the Council established new special \r\nprocedures mandates, both country and thematic, \r\nbringing the total number of mandates to 51. The \r\nnew mandates include the Independent Expert on the \r\nenjoyment of all human rights by older persons, the \r\nindependent expert on the situation of human rights \r\nin Mali and the Independent Expert on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Central African Republic.\r\nIn 2013, the Council adopted a total of 107 \r\nresolutions, decisions and President’s statements. Also, \r\nthe number of cross-regional initiatives continued to \r\nincrease, underscoring the capacity of the Council \r\nto take action on important human rights issues by \r\novercoming different political positions. For instance, \r\nthe resolutions on local Government and human rights; \r\non the elimination of child, early and forced marriages; \r\non the role of the freedom of opinion and expression \r\nin women’s empowerment; and on the question of the \r\ndeath penalty; as well as country-specific issues, were \r\nsubmitted by cross-regional groups of States. Many \r\nof the resolutions were adopted without a vote. At the \r\nSeptember session, for instance, of 40 resolutions and \r\ndecisions, 33 were adopted without a vote. That also \r\ndemonstrates the increased capacity of the Council to \r\nagree on issues relating to the protection of those most \r\nin need. The number of cross-regional joint statements \r\nhas also increased, covering a range of topics.\r\nLet me now turn to the role of civil society in the \r\nproceedings of the Council. The active participation \r\nand contribution of civil society organizations is central \r\nto the work of the Human Rights Council and makes it a \r\nunique forum among United Nations intergovernmental \r\norgans. It is therefore essential that representatives of \r\ncivil society operate in a free, open and safe environment \r\nthat protects and promotes their own human rights. \r\nI have personally condemned acts of reprisal in the \r\ncontext of sessions of the Council and of the universal \r\nperiodic review (UPR) and have repeatedly stated that \r\nany acts of intimidation or reprisal against individuals \r\n13-56114 5/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nfinancial situation, I would like to seek the cooperation \r\nand support of all Member States to address the issue, \r\nthrough the Fifth Committee, by positively considering \r\noptions on how to address the funding of new mandates \r\narising from resolutions and decisions of the Council.\r\nI have held the presidency since January 2013 \r\nand will end my term at the end of this year. I would \r\nlike to conclude by assuring the General Assembly \r\nof my commitment to see a successful transfer of the \r\npresidency to my successor. I hope that the Assembly \r\nwill continue to provide its full and efficient support \r\nto the Council during its eighth cycle. On behalf of \r\nmy successor, I would like to welcome all members to \r\nthe twenty-fifth session of the Council, to be held in \r\nGeneva in March 2014.\r\nMrs. Bibalou (Gabon): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nThe African Group welcomes the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, His Excellency Mr. Remigiusz \r\nAchilles Henczel, and wishes to extend its appreciation \r\nfor this opportunity to hold a dialogue on the activities \r\nof the Council during its seventh cycle as set out in \r\nthe report of the Human Rights Council (A/68/53). We \r\nalso welcome the President’s leadership of that body \r\nthroughout the year.\r\nThe African Group wishes to reaffirm the \r\nCouncil’s mandate, as contained in resolution 60/251, \r\nin promoting universal respect for the protection of \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal \r\nmanner, and to make recommendations thereon. It is on \r\nthat basis that the Group has consistently supported the \r\nwork of the Council.\r\nThe Group views the principles underpinning the \r\nCouncil’s mandate as important, particularly with \r\nrespect to the principle of cooperation and genuine \r\ndialogue aimed at strengthening the capacity of Member \r\nStates to comply with their human rights obligations. It \r\nis therefore incumbent upon the Council in discharging \r\nits mandate to firmly ground its work on universality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of \r\nhuman rights issues.\r\nThere is no doubt that the universal periodic \r\nreview (UPR) remains the most distinct mechanism of \r\nuniversal application to assist States in fulfilling their \r\nhuman rights obligations. In our view, that mechanism \r\nremains relevant and key as it concerns the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. It is therefore critical \r\nconsistent manner to all States under review, we will \r\ncontribute to strengthening the UPR’s credibility and \r\nto a successful second cycle of the review, taking into \r\naccount one of its principles, namely, that of the equal \r\ntreatment of all States under review.\r\nI wish to acknowledge the fact that the constructive, \r\nconsensual and non-politicized approach maintained \r\nby the Council throughout this year has encouraged \r\nIsrael to re-engage with the UPR. I welcome Israel’s \r\nre-engagement, as it upholds the integrity and the \r\nuniversality of that important process.\r\nUniversal participation is essential to the process, \r\nand many among the participants today have been \r\ninvolved in ensuring the presence of delegations \r\nfrom countries far away from Geneva and without a \r\nPermanent Mission in that city. I would like to thank \r\nthem for their efforts. In that regard, I participated in \r\nthe interregional seminar to facilitate the participation \r\nof least developed countries (LDCs) and small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) in the Human Rights Council \r\nand its universal periodic review, which was held on \r\n30 and 31 July in Mauritius. That was the first time \r\nthat such a seminar was organized. It focused on \r\nfacilitating the participation of small island developing \r\nStates and least developed countries in the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and its universal periodic \r\nreview mechanism. Participants in the two-day \r\nseminar included 23 delegates from 14 LDCs or SIDS. \r\nDuring the seminar, they received comprehensive \r\ninformation and tools on the Human Rights Council \r\nand its subsidiary mechanisms, particularly the UPR. \r\nI take this opportunity to thank the Government of \r\nMauritius for hosting the seminar and the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) for having successfully organized the event.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to touch briefly \r\nupon the significant challenges the Human Rights \r\nCouncil is facing in terms of resources required for it \r\nto continue its activities. As I said earlier, the Council \r\ncontinues to adopt a high number of resolutions and \r\ndecisions, giving rise to new mandates for Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to implement, \r\ncarrying significant resource implications. Indeed, \r\nwhile the OHCHR is requested to comply with an \r\nincreasing number of mandates stemming from the \r\nCouncil’s decisions, its regular budget has not kept pace \r\nwith that growth. The OHCHR therefore often has to \r\nrely on voluntary contributions to implement mandated \r\nactivities. Although I am fully aware of the current \r\n6/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nmechanisms currently being utilized in other United \r\nNations bodies prior to such a determination being \r\nmade by the Human Rights Council. The Group wishes \r\nto reiterate its position on rejecting any form of reprisals \r\non individuals or groups.\r\nIn conclusion, the African Group wishes to \r\nreassure the President of the Council of our support in \r\nthe preparations for the eighth cycle year of the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMs. Kaljulate (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe candidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland and Serbia; the \r\ncountries of the Stabilization and Association Process \r\nand potential candidates Albania and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; as well as the Republic of Moldova, align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nHenczel, for introducing the Council’s eighth annual \r\nreport (A/68/53) to the General Assembly. We also \r\nappreciated the opportunity to hold an interactive \r\ndialogue with the Human Rights Council President at \r\nthe Third Committee.\r\nSince the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the European Union has been a strong \r\nsupporter of the main United Nations human rights \r\nbody. The Council has strengthened the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to ensure that all persons enjoy their \r\nhuman rights. We attach great importance to the \r\ncredibility and effectiveness of the Council and will \r\ncontinue to make every effort to ensure that it is able \r\nto address situations of violations of human rights, \r\nincluding gross and systematic violations, and respond \r\npromptly to human rights emergencies, but also to \r\nimprove human rights standards worldwide through \r\nsystematic work on various thematic issues.\r\nIn view of that, the European Union is very pleased \r\nto note that the Council has maintained its leadership \r\nin addressing human rights situations. In particular, \r\nthe Council’s response to the crisis in the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic is highly important, including the holding \r\nof an urgent debate and extending the mandate of the \r\nCommission of Inquiry, which is the only international \r\ninvestigative mechanism on human rights violations \r\nthat the United Nations voluntary fund for financial \r\nand technical assistance for the implementation of the \r\nUPR be properly resourced for the purpose of assisting \r\nStates to develop their national capacity and expertise \r\nfor the implementation of recommendations.\r\nThe Group reiterates its support for the mechanisms \r\nand special procedures of the Council and the important \r\nwork they undertake in the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nIn recent times, the Council has faced governance \r\nchallenges, particularly with respect to the erosion \r\nof the provisions of the institution-building package, \r\nwhich is the solid foundation on which its mandate \r\nrests. The Group is concerned that the erosion could, in \r\nthe long run, present credibility gaps in its work.\r\nWhile the Group has also noted the immense \r\nwork that the Council engages in at each session, the \r\nchallenges presented by a shortage of funding remains \r\nunresolved. The African Group believes, therefore, that \r\nthose funding shortages will affect the implementation \r\nof the decisions and resolutions of the Council. We also \r\nwish to recognize the key role played by the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, as the secretariat of the Council, in ensuring \r\nthat appropriate support is given to the Council in line \r\nwith the framework of resolution 48/141.\r\nThe annual report (A/68/53) submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly presents a comprehensive picture \r\nof the deliberations that have taken place during \r\nthe Council’s seventh cycle year. The Group is also \r\ncognizant of the provisions of paragraph 5 of resolution \r\n60/251, which provides for recommendations to be \r\nmade by the Council to the Third Committee, hence its \r\nsupport for the universal membership of the General \r\nAssembly to deliberate on those important matters.\r\nThe African Group believes that Human \r\nRights Council resolution 24/24, adopted during its \r\ntwenty-fourth session in September, makees critical \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly with \r\nrespect to the designation of the United Nations-wide \r\nsenior focal point to prevent, protect against and \r\npromote accountability for reprisals and intimidation. \r\nIt is the view of the Group that such a matter needs \r\nfurther reflection and deliberation by the general and \r\nuniversal membership of the General Assembly prior \r\nto a determination being made. Equally, the Group \r\nbelieves that a feasibility study should, as a matter of \r\nnecessity, be undertaken to take stock of the different \r\n13-56114 7/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nof new Independent Expert mandates on the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Mali.\r\nThematic special procedures play an equally \r\nimportant role through their research, country-\r\nspecific visits and valuable contribution to the better \r\nunderstanding of the content of specific human \r\nrights and their contribution to the enhancement and \r\nrealization of human rights standards. Among the \r\nmany thematic special procedures, the EU would like \r\nto highlight the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on \r\nthe freedom of religion or belief, who plays an active \r\nrole in identifying existing and emerging obstacles to \r\nthe enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or \r\nbelief and presenting recommendations to overcome \r\nsuch obstacles.\r\nThe European Union remains strongly committed \r\nto the universal periodic review (UPR), a truly universal \r\nand unique mechanism within the United Nations \r\nthat addresses all human rights and applies to all \r\nMember States without distinction or discrimination. \r\nThat mechanism serves as an ongoing contribution \r\nto the promotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms on the ground. Preserving the \r\nuniversality of the universal periodic review process \r\nis of paramount importance, and in that regard the \r\nCouncil has been successful.\r\nUltimately, the quality of the review \r\nrecommendations and the commitment to implement \r\nthem are key for the outcome of that process. In \r\naccordance with existing rules and practice, all \r\nrecommendations made during the interactive dialogue \r\nneed to be included and noted as such in the report of \r\nthe Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. \r\nEqual treatment of all countries is an underlying element \r\nof the UPR mechanism, and needs to be maintained \r\nthroughout each cycle. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nPresident’s letter clarifying certain procedural aspects \r\nof the UPR process.\r\nThe EU wishes in particular to highlight and \r\nwelcome several important developments during the \r\nreporting period.\r\nFirst, the enjoyment of human rights by women and \r\ngirls figured as a major theme of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil agenda during the period under review. The \r\nCouncil decided to hold a panel discussion on the \r\nprevention and elimination of child, early and forced \r\nmarriage, placing that issue on the Council agenda for \r\nin the country. The Council has also demonstrated \r\nits commitment to providing technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building to the Governments of Afghanistan, \r\nCambodia, the Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of \r\nGuinea, Haiti, Mali, Somalia, South Sudan, the Sudan \r\nand Yemen to promote human rights. The EU hopes that \r\nthe Council will continue to follow situations where \r\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building can make a \r\ndifference, and take action where necessary.\r\nOn Tuesday, the General Assembly elected 14 new \r\nmembers of the Council (see A/68/PV.51). Serving as a \r\nmember entails important responsibilities. Resolution \r\n60/251 provides that members elected to the Council \r\nshall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. We encourage all to pay full \r\nattention to the human rights records and human rights \r\ncommitments of States throughout their membership, \r\nas well as at the time of the elections.\r\nThe EU highly values the work of special \r\nprocedures and is firmly convinced that they play a \r\ncrucial role in advancing the human rights agenda. \r\nAs we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nVienna Declaration and Programme of Action, which \r\nhas anchored the system of special procedures in the \r\ninternational human rights protection system, we still \r\nneed to significantly improve the overall cooperation \r\namong States and mandate holders. All EU member \r\nStates have extended a standing invitation to the special \r\nprocedures, and the EU calls upon all United Nations \r\nMembers to do likewise and to actively cooperate with \r\nthem. In order to allow special procedures to perform \r\ntheir role, it is crucial that mandate holders be able to \r\nindependently assess and draw the Council’s attention \r\nto human rights issues and situations. The EU welcomes \r\nthe use of the collective voice of the special procedures \r\nand the growing participation of mandate holders in the \r\nCouncil.\r\nGiven the situation in the countries, the EU \r\nwelcomes the extension of the mandates on Belarus, \r\nEritrea, Myanmar/Burma and Iran. We welcome the \r\nextension of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and \r\nthe establishment of a commission of inquiry on the \r\nsituation of human rights in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, as well as the mandate renewals of \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on Eritrea and the Independent \r\nExperts on the situation of human rights in Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, the Sudan, Somalia and Haiti, and the creation \r\n8/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\ncooperation, transparency and non-selectivity in the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms for all. We believe that the \r\nHuman Rights Council should emerge as a forum \r\nfor voluntary participation and for sharing national \r\nexperiences and best practices in the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights. There should be emphasis \r\non capacity-building of States through technical and \r\nfinancial assistance.\r\nIt goes without saying that the actions of the \r\nUnited Nations and its organs should be anchored in \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWe believe that the collaboration of all States, in the \r\nspirit of equal and mutually respectful dialogue, is \r\nthe most effective tool to promote and protect human \r\nrights. That will not only strengthen the confidence \r\nof all interested parties in the Human Rights Council \r\nand its mechanisms, but will also contribute to the \r\nreinforcement of the Council’s political and moral \r\nauthority and credibility.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation \r\nto the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nMs. Navenetham Pillay, and her Office for supporting \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council. Serious thought \r\nneeds to be given to increasing the accountability of the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights (OHCHR) to the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe believe that our common endeavour to promote \r\nand protect all human rights for all globally can be \r\nadvanced further through a formalized interaction that \r\nstrengthens institutional linkages between the Council \r\nand OHCHR.\r\nRegular interaction between OHCHR and the \r\nHuman Rights Council in Geneva and the General \r\nAssembly in New York is important for deliberations \r\non issues such as OHCHR’s strategic thematic \r\npriorities, budgetary considerations, staffing, et cetera. \r\nIt remains a matter of concern that OHCHR depends \r\non voluntary funding for two-thirds of its budget. That \r\nfinancial dependence distorts strategic planning and the \r\nallocation of available resources in OHCHR’s work. The \r\ngeographical imbalance in the staffing pattern of the \r\nOffice also continues to be a matter of concern. Those \r\nmatters require greater attention and deliberation.\r\nSpecial procedures are an important mechanism \r\nof the Human Rights Council for a genuine dialogue \r\nfor strengthening the capacity of Member States. It is \r\ntherefore important that Special Rapporteurs maintain \r\nthe first time. The Council also decided to hold a panel \r\ndiscussion on female genital mutilation.\r\nSecondly, the Council addressed the issue of the \r\ndeath penalty through two new initiatives.\r\nThirdly, the Council continued its crucial work \r\non the rights of the child, with a full-day annual \r\npanel discussion and a resolution, presented jointly \r\nby the European Union and the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Group, dedicated to the enjoyment of the \r\nhighest attainable standard of health.\r\nFourthly, the Council also adopted its first \r\nresolution on creating and maintaining, in law and \r\nin practice, a safe and enabling environment for civil \r\nsociety, underlining the important role of civil society \r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nThe EU reiterates its strongest condemnation \r\nof acts of reprisals and intimidation of civil society \r\nrepresentatives attending the Human Rights Council \r\nand cooperating with human rights mechanisms and \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights. Contributions by civil society \r\norganizations and national human rights institutions \r\nare extremely valuable to the work of the Council. Their \r\nability to interact with the Council must be preserved. \r\nWe appreciate Mr. Henczel’s vocal role as President and \r\nhis efforts to preserve space for civil society. We are \r\nvery pleased that the President’s role has been formally \r\nacknowledged in that regard through the Council’s \r\nresolution cooperation with the United Nations, its \r\nrepresentatives and mechanisms in the field of human \r\nrights.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate our unwavering \r\ncommitment to contribute to the work of the Human \r\nRights Council and to further strengthen its role in the \r\ndevelopment of international human rights law. We \r\nwill continue to systematically uphold and ensure the \r\nimplementation of existing international norms and \r\nstandards, to strongly advocate for the universality \r\nof human rights and to promote the observance by all \r\nStates of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nMr. Rajeeve (India): We thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for his briefing on the activities \r\nof the Council.\r\nHuman rights questions are among the most \r\nimportant and cross-cutting of all subjects in the realm \r\nof international discussions today. The strength of the \r\nHuman Rights Council lies in its emphasis on dialogue, \r\n13-56114 9/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nHenczel, for his introduction of the report on the \r\nCouncil (A/68/53).\r\nMexico is firmly committed to strengthening \r\nthe international system of human rights and thereby \r\nconsolidating the Human Rights Council. The Council \r\nis the premier multilateral body for promoting human \r\nrights, preventing new violations and developing ways \r\nof ensuring protection and non-recurrence. Faithful \r\nto that commitment, we were active participants in \r\nthe establishment of the Council, and we maintain a \r\npermanent policy of cooperation with the specialized \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations and the Organization \r\nof American States, including an open invitation to \r\nvisit our country. Since 2009, my country has had \r\nnine visits from the United Nations inter-American \r\nsystem mechanism and the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights. Thanks to the agreement and support of \r\npolitical stakeholders, civil society organizations and \r\nnational and international human rights bodies with the \r\nability to promote a joint agenda benefiting Mexicans, \r\nwe have made progress in the area of human rights, \r\nputting us on the road to achieving a society of rights \r\nand a country of opportunity for all.\r\nAware that the recognition and protection of \r\nhuman rights should be guiding principles for State \r\naction, in 2011 we enacted human-rights reforms of \r\nour Constitution, representing the largest expansion \r\nof rights therein since its promulgation in 1917. The \r\n2011 reform recognizes the importance of human rights \r\nunder international treaties to which Mexico is a party, \r\nestablishing the people-first principles of universality, \r\nprogressivity, interdependence and indivisibility. \r\nLess than a month ago, Mexico submitted its second \r\nreport to the universal periodic review mechanism, \r\nfocusing on the implementation and follow-up to the \r\nrecommendations received in its first evaluation. In that \r\nexercise, the extent of the interventions was testament \r\nto the universality of this instrument, in which States \r\nparticipate on an equal footing, and demonstrated the \r\nmechanism’s importance as one of the main tools by \r\nwhich the Human Rights Council can comprehensively \r\naddress the human rights situation in every State. The \r\nreport allowed us to identify areas where we have \r\nmade progress in human rights but also where we have \r\nsignificant setbacks and challenges to overcome. We \r\nare aware that protecting human rights is a constant \r\ntask and inherent part of building our democracy, \r\nand we therefore welcome this comprehensive and \r\nconfidence by adhering to the code of conduct and their \r\nmandates established by the Council. We also reiterate \r\nthe importance of ensuring the equitable distribution \r\nof financial resources among all special procedures \r\nmandate holders through a transparent process. In that \r\nregard, we would like to request the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council to reflect on those important \r\nissues and exchange views on the steps that can be \r\ntaken by the Council.\r\nI would also like to briefly refer to the issue of \r\nreprisals. We share the view that any act of reprisal or \r\nintimidation is unacceptable and must be dealt with \r\neffectively. However, we regret that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil was unable to address that issue in a unified \r\nmanner. We are in fact concerned by attempts in the \r\nCouncil to trespass into areas that do not lie strictly \r\nwithin its mandate.\r\nThe appointment of a United Nations-wide \r\nmechanism on reprisals that will address other United \r\nNations entities not primarily dealing with human \r\nrights issues is the prerogative of the body that has \r\nuniversal representation. We would have preferred \r\nthat such matters be transmitted to the competent \r\nbody — the General Assembly — of which the Human \r\nRights Council is a subsidiary body. We would like to \r\nunderline the importance of the Council’s adherence \r\nto the institution-building package in carrying out its \r\nmandate.\r\nAllow me also to place on record our appreciation \r\nto the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMr. Remigiusz Henczel, for the smooth and effective \r\nmanner in which he has conducted the deliberations \r\nof the Council. We also appreciate his efforts in \r\nstreamlining the work of the Council through the \r\nannual voluntary calendar of Human Rights Council \r\nthematic resolutions.\r\nWe believe that the Human Rights Council \r\nshould continue to rationalize and prioritize its work \r\nto make the most efficient use of limited resources. \r\nWe reiterate our firm commitment to continuing to \r\nengage constructively with all Member States to make \r\nthe Council more effective, efficient and responsive. \r\nWe believe we can advance our common cause only \r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation.\r\nMrs. Morgan (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to begin by thanking the President of the Human \r\nRights Council, Ambassador Remigiusz Achilles \r\n10/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nThe Philippines supports the Human Rights Council \r\nin its efforts to strengthen the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights and attaches great importance to the \r\nmaintenance of its credibility and effectiveness in \r\naddressing human rights violations. We congratulate \r\nthe newly elected members of the Council and, as a \r\ncurrent and founding member, look forward to continue \r\nworking closely with all stakeholders to ensure that the \r\nCouncil fulfils its mandate, fosters healthy dialogue and \r\ncooperation and contributes to concrete and positive \r\nchanges to the human rights situation on the ground.\r\nGiven the number of resolutions adopted by the \r\nCouncil this year, covering a broad array of issues, we \r\nstand committed more than ever to exerting greater \r\nefforts to ensure that the Council remains responsibly \r\nresponsive in the face of current and emerging human \r\nrights challenges. As the Council, together with the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, continues to develop international \r\nhuman rights standards and to work for greater \r\nconsistency in normative frameworks, it is our position \r\nthat the Council should remain focused on helping \r\nand encouraging all countries to build an environment \r\nenabling them to better promote the human rights of \r\ntheir peoples, in constructive cooperation with the \r\ninternational community and civil society. It should be \r\na partner of all States and stakeholders in the promotion \r\nand protection of all human rights, with a strong focus \r\non capacity-building and international cooperation, \r\nand it must continue to work in a constructive manner, \r\nengaging in meaningful interaction with them.\r\nThe Human Rights Council has made reasonable \r\nprogress in fulfilling its mandate as set forth in resolution \r\n60/251. We value the universal periodic review (UPR) \r\nas an effective mechanism of the Council, helping \r\nto ensure the principles of universality, objectivity \r\nand fairness, and to institutionalize cooperative \r\nand constructive dialogue on human rights in a less \r\npoliticized and non-selective manner. The participation \r\nby all States in the first cycle reflects the universality \r\nand credibility of the UPR as an effective mechanism. It \r\nis our sincere hope that all Member States will continue \r\nto participate in the second cycle, to maintain the \r\nuniversality and credibility of the UPR as a mechanism \r\nof the Council. The UPR is a continuing process, and \r\nnot merely a venue for scheduled reporting and review. \r\nThe second cycle serves as an important follow-up to \r\nthe recommendations that are made, and Member States \r\nhave the primary responsibility for recognizing that.\r\nparticipatory exercise, which reflects our country’s \r\nplurality.\r\nMexico has been and will continue to be a \r\nresponsible and active participant in building and \r\noperating the current international human rights \r\nframework. During our next term as a member of the \r\nCouncil, beginning on 1 January 2014, we will continue \r\nto promote respect for and promotion of the rights of \r\nmigrants, people with disabilities and indigenous \r\npeoples. We will also submit initiatives, among others, \r\naimed at countering and eliminating discrimination \r\nagainst women, protecting human rights in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, and promoting the registration of \r\nbirths and the right to recognition as a person before \r\nthe law.\r\nIt is also important to emphasize that we consider \r\nit fundamental that the Human Rights Council focus \r\non preventing impunity by documenting situations \r\nof serious violations of human rights. In the context \r\nof cooperation that is typical of the Council, Mexico \r\nis working on actions on three fronts — reaffirming \r\nhuman rights as Government policy; helping the \r\nCouncil to deal effectively with its challenges, political \r\nas well as institutional and normative; and extending \r\nthe support it makes available in sharing experiences \r\nand lessons learned with other Member States.\r\nThe report we are considering today reflects the \r\nlarge number of new initiatives addressing issues \r\nrelevant to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights in the context of the Council. We also welcome \r\nthe strengthening of the Council’s mandates over the \r\npast year. We know that the Council’s relevance is \r\ndependent on its members, and we recognize that it is the \r\nresponsibility of States to strengthen its effectiveness \r\nand the priority that the General Assembly and other \r\norgans of the system accord its recommendations. For \r\nthat reason, we welcome the fact that an increasing \r\nnumber of States are recognizing the Council and its \r\nprimary role in incorporating human rights into all \r\nUnited Nations activities.\r\nMr. Cabactulan (Philippines): We appreciate the \r\nopportunity to speak on this agenda item, which is of \r\nhigh priority to the Philippines as a founding and current \r\nmember of the Human Rights Council. We would like \r\nto thank the President of the Council, Ambassador \r\nRemigiusz Achilles Henczel, for introducing its annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly (A/68/53).\r\n13-56114 11/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nAlso related to development, my country has now \r\nbeen subjected to massive devastation and destruction \r\nwrought not by a super storm but by a monster \r\nstorm — the strongest storm in recorded history. Yet \r\nsome scientists are still not in agreement that such \r\nnatural phenomena are directly related to climate \r\nchange. All we know is that we suffer the brunt, the \r\nwrath of nature, and what we have observed in more \r\nthan five years are the increased frequency and ferocity \r\nof the storms and typhoons visiting our shores. In fact, \r\nwe also observe that typhoons visiting the Philippines \r\nhave in fact also taken new paths not taken by typhoons \r\nin the past. We hope that the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and the Warsaw Climate \r\nChange Conference, taking place this month, will be \r\nable to produce a real outcome that will make a dent on \r\nclimate change, finally securing planet Earth. \r\nLet me also take this opportunity to convey \r\nthe genuine gratitude of my Government for the \r\nsolidarity shown by the United Nations system and \r\nthe international community and the unprecedented \r\nsupport given to my country now that it is suffering \r\ndire need and is in an extremely difficult situation. This \r\nhas been unprecedented support by the international \r\ncommunity given in the aftermath of the unprecedented \r\nstorm that visited my country.\r\nIt may be recalled that in the Human Rights Council \r\nin 2011, the Philippines, together with Bangladesh, \r\nintroduced a draft resolution on human rights and \r\nclimate change that reiterated the concern that climate \r\nchange posed an immediate and far-reaching threat \r\nto people and communities around the world and had \r\nimplications on the full enjoyment of human rights. \r\nMy country knows that at first hand. What is there to \r\npromote when even Government is not present during \r\ntimes of real massive destruction?\r\nIn conclusion, we remain steadfast in our \r\ncommitment to providing a meaningful contribution \r\nto the work of the Council and to the promotion and \r\nprotection of all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms.\r\nMr. AlSaleh (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Today \r\nwe are discussing one of the most important items \r\ninscribed on the agenda, namely, the work of the Human \r\nRights Council. I would like to thank the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the efforts it has made, as set out in its report \r\n(A/68/53), as well as its coverage of topics relating to \r\nhuman rights, including, most significantly, the right to \r\nThe special procedures have an important role in \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. They bring \r\nalleged violations or abuses to world attention, raise \r\npublic awareness, contribute to the development of \r\ninternational human rights standards and provide \r\nadvice for technical cooperation. However, in the \r\nperformance of those tasks, the special procedures must \r\nalways be guided by the objectives of resolution 60/251, \r\nwhich recognizes that the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights should be based on the principles of \r\ncooperation and genuine dialogue and should be aimed \r\nat strengthening the capacity of Member States to \r\ncomply with their human rights obligations, for the \r\nbenefit of all human beings. While the independence \r\nof mandate holders is vital to their work, it must always \r\nbe balanced with important considerations, such as \r\nprofessionalism, integrity, efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nDiscussions on the strengthening of the human \r\nrights treaty bodies will resume next month. We look \r\nforward to actively participating in the discussions and \r\nhope that we can, within a reasonable period, conclude \r\nwith an outcome that is acceptable to all. There are \r\nseveral outstanding issues that need to be discussed \r\nfurther. Ultimately for us, however, strengthening \r\nthe treaty body system means having a meaningful \r\nimpact on both rights-holders and duty-bearers, with \r\nthe end goal of promoting an enabling environment \r\nfor the effective protection of the human rights of all \r\npersons, particularly those who are most vulnerable, \r\nsuch as women and children, persons with disabilities, \r\nmigrant workers and persons vulnerable to racial \r\ndiscrimination, not just on the domestic level but on the \r\ninternational level as well.\r\nTwenty years ago, the World Conference on Human \r\nRights adopted by consensus the Vienna Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action, which reaffirmed the right \r\nto development as a universal and inalienable right \r\nand an integral part of fundamental human rights. \r\nThree overarching themes were at the heart of the \r\nWorld Conference: the universality of human rights, \r\nthe importance of democratic participation and the \r\nimperative of development. Sadly, the latter seems \r\nnot to have been given the attention it deserves, even \r\nthough it is rooted in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. My \r\ndelegation will therefore continue to advocate for, and \r\nsupport discussions on, the right to development, with \r\na view to ensuring its realization, particularly in the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\n12/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nIn the context of our efforts to promote the role \r\nand rights of persons with disabilities in society, the \r\nState of Kuwait acceded to the Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities on 22 August, in \r\nimplementation of our commitment to the Human \r\nRights Council during our submission under the \r\nuniversal periodic review. \r\nThe State of Kuwait provides many forms of \r\nhumanitarian assistance through international and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, such as the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, as it believes in the need to promote international \r\npeace and security and human rights. As a result, the \r\nState of Kuwait hosted the first international donors \r\nconference for Syria last January, at which more than \r\n$1.5 billion was pledged in support of humanitarian \r\nactivities in that country. We also welcome the call \r\nof Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to host a second \r\ndonors conference next year in Kuwait in order to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the brotherly people of Syria. \r\nWe underscore our support for the draft resolution \r\nbefore the Third Committee on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Syrian Arab Republic (A/C.3/68/L.42), \r\nwhich strongly condemns the continued widespread \r\nand systematic gross violations of human rights and \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law through \r\nthe continued use of heavy weapons and aerial \r\nbombardments by the Syrian authorities in populated \r\nareas. We also condemn all such violations by the \r\narmed opposition forces. \r\nWe also condemn Israel’s illegal settlement \r\nactivities and practices in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories and its continued human rights violations \r\nagainst the Palestinian people through restrictions on \r\ntheir freedom of movement, the confiscation of land, \r\nthe destruction of their homes and the imprisonment \r\nof thousands of Palestinians in conditions that breach \r\nbasic human rights law. Israel also imposes an unjust \r\nblockade on Gaza in breach of human rights and the \r\nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention of \r\n1949. The international community should therefore \r\nshoulder its responsibilities and compel Israel to fulfil \r\nits obligations under international law.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to underscore our \r\nrespect for international human rights agreements and \r\ninstruments. We support all efforts to promote and \r\nuphold such instruments. We believe in strengthening \r\nour cooperation in that regard in order to achieve our \r\nfreedom of expression and issues pertaining to women, \r\nchildren and education, among others. The report also \r\ncovers other important aspects of human rights, such as \r\nmatters concerning non-discrimination, the rejection of \r\nviolence and the prevention of genocide, that reflect the \r\nimportant role undertaken by the Council to defend and \r\npromote human rights.\r\nThe State of Kuwait contributes effectively to \r\npromoting human rights at the international level \r\nthrough its support to States and international \r\norganizations, politically and materially, as reflected in \r\nits efforts since it joined the Human Rights Council in \r\nmid-2011.\r\nA look into the situation of human rights in Kuwait \r\nreveals that they are, to a great extent, a reality. That is \r\ndue to the fact that instituting them was not a spur-of-\r\nthe-moment reaction or a new concern in the State of \r\nKuwait. Rather, since our country’s inception, human \r\nrights have been rooted in our universal Islamic and \r\nArab heritage. They constitute a principle that we have \r\nadopted, and we do not deviate from them because we \r\nbelieve in respect for lofty human rights and values.\r\nWhen Kuwait drafted its Constitution in 1962, it \r\ntook into consideration human rights in general, and \r\nit placed international instruments and declarations \r\namong the most important reference points. Human \r\ndignity in the State of Kuwait is protected. Many \r\nprovisions stipulate that, including articles 29 and 31 \r\nof our first Constitution, which emphasize equality and \r\nhuman dignity and the impermissibility of imprisoning \r\npersons except by law. The Constitution took into \r\nconsideration the rights of workers residing on our \r\nterritory. Article 40 of the Constitution provides that the \r\nright to education is enshrined in our law; we provide \r\nfree compulsory education at all educational stages.\r\nThe State of Kuwait emphasizes its commitment \r\nto the standards of human rights, and the Kuwaiti \r\nConstitution issued in 1962 conforms to those criteria. \r\nArticle 35 stipulates that the freedom of belief is \r\nabsolute, and the State protects religious rights and \r\nrituals. With regard to the freedom of opinion and \r\nexpression, article 36 of our Constitution stipulates \r\nthat the freedoms of opinion and of scientific research \r\nare guaranteed. Every person has the right to express \r\nhis opinion verbally and in writing under the law: our \r\nConstitution underscores the freedom to write, print \r\nand publish. Article 37 stipulates that freedom of the \r\npress and printing is guaranteed by law. \r\n13-56114 13/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nBy undergoing the second cycle of the UPR in \r\nJanuary and June, Liechtenstein has again benefited \r\nfrom a wealth of recommendations, the large majority of \r\nwhich it has accepted. Once implemented, we trust that \r\nthose recommendations will considerably strengthen \r\nthe protection of human rights in Liechtenstein, as is \r\nthe case with other States that perceive the UPR as an \r\nopportunity to promote improvements.\r\nMr. Errázuriz (Chile), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe Human Rights Council increasingly lives up to \r\nits responsibility to address human rights emergencies \r\nwith the tools at its disposal. Liechtenstein welcomes \r\nthe repeated action of the Council to address the human \r\nrights emergency in Syria. At the same time, it is \r\nsobering that the aspect of ending impunity has not been \r\naccorded the priority that it deserves. Accountability is \r\nkey to ending the cycles of violence that have caused \r\nso many civilian deaths in Syria. The Council and \r\nits mechanisms must therefore take a clear stance on \r\nensuring that justice is served for the victims in Syria. \r\nThe Commission of Inquiry on Syria continues \r\nto do valuable work in gathering evidence of mass \r\natrocities. It is hardly comprehensible, however, that \r\nthe Commission does not express itself more clearly \r\non concrete options to ensure accountability. In our \r\nview, that can be detrimental to the fulfilment of its \r\nmandate to establish the facts of alleged mass atrocities \r\nand to identify those responsible with a view to holding \r\nthem accountable. In addition, a clear position by the \r\nCommission on judicial follow-up could help shape the \r\ncurrent discussions on that subject. \r\nLiechtenstein continues to consider the International \r\nCriminal Court as the appropriate institution to deal \r\nwith the situation in Syria in the light of its gravity. We \r\nrepeat our call on the Security Council to take action \r\naccordingly.\r\nThe Human Rights Council has again contributed \r\nsubstantially to both long-standing and emerging \r\nhuman rights discussions. Liechtenstein welcomes the \r\nCouncil’s more active role in the global discussion on \r\nthe death penalty and its implications. We look forward \r\nto a more in-depth and systematic look at that issue \r\nunder the framework of the Council. We believe that \r\nthe Council can make an important contribution to a \r\nbetter informed and less confrontational discussion \r\naimed at concrete steps towards improved procedures, \r\njoint aspirations for the advancement and prosperity of \r\nour nations and peoples.\r\nMr. Barriga (Liechtenstein): Liechtenstein \r\nwelcomes President Henczel to the General Assembly \r\nand thanks him for his introducing the Human \r\nRights Council’s report (A/68/53). His engagement in \r\npromoting and improving the work of the Council is \r\nexemplary and part of a tradition of strong leadership \r\nin that body. The challenges that the Council has faced \r\nthis year have been particularly serious due to their \r\npotential to affect its future course. Liechtenstein is \r\ngrateful to the President for his personal and successful \r\ncommitment to preserving the integrity of the Council \r\nand its mechanisms, in particular the universality of the \r\nuniversal periodic review (UPR), which is the basis for \r\nconstructive cooperation among Member States in the \r\nframework of the UPR. \r\nLiechtenstein sees in the participation in the UPR \r\na first and necessary step towards the more substantive \r\ncooperation that every Member State should make on \r\nthe basis of its sovereign equality — a principle that \r\nis enshrined in the Charter and that is not negotiable. \r\nBut, even with its universality preserved, the UPR has \r\nsuffered from attempts at its politicization. Liechtenstein \r\ncalls on all States to refrain from interfering in the \r\ncarefully designed proceedings of the UPR in order to \r\nensure its continued functioning.\r\nWith its second cycle well under way, the UPR \r\ncontinues to bring key value added to the Council, in \r\nparticular as compared to its predecessor body. It has \r\ndeveloped into a cornerstone of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery. The UPR has also generated \r\nconsiderable momentum among States to examine and \r\nto improve their domestic human rights situations. \r\nIt promotes ratification of the core human rights \r\ninstruments, and thus contributes to the long-term goal \r\nof achieving universality. \r\nAt the same time, the second UPR cycle has shone \r\na spotlight on the discrepancies between political \r\ncommitment and implementation. That is where our \r\nemphasis should lie in future. States should increasingly \r\naim their recommendations at the implementation of \r\ninternational standards by focusing on concrete and \r\nactionable steps to assist them in that regard. In parallel, \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights should be given the financial \r\nresources necessary to assist States in following up on \r\ntheir commitments. \r\n14/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nthe assistance of country-specific resolutions from \r\nthe Human Rights Council. Examples include the \r\nCentral African Republic, Somalia, Côte d’Ivoire and \r\nSouth Sudan. We are also pleased that the resolution \r\nentitled “Advisory services and technical assistance for \r\nCambodia”, submitted by Japan in cooperation with \r\nCambodia, was adopted by consensus. We support the \r\nCouncil in its efforts to continue to provide capacity-\r\nbuilding through such resolutions.\r\nThe universal periodic review (UPR) is a truly \r\ninnovative mechanism within the Council, through \r\nwhich we can effectively improve the human rights \r\nsituation in all Member States through the voluntary \r\nfollow-up actions associated with the review. Japan \r\nwill actively engage in the efforts to make the UPR, \r\nincluding the follow-up, more effective. On the other \r\nhand, the UPR alone is insufficient to address the serious \r\nhuman rights violations that occur around the world. \r\nIn that regard, the special procedures complement \r\nthe UPR and are indispensable mechanisms. If the \r\nspecial procedures are to achieve their mandate, their \r\nindependence and unfettered access to the countries \r\nconcerned are essential. We therefore call on all parties \r\nto fully cooperate with the special procedures. For \r\nits part, Japan has issued a standing invitation to the \r\nspecial procedures mechanisms and will, as always, \r\nfully cooperate with them.\r\nIn the field of human rights, it is essential to work \r\nwith civil society. Progress in that regard was made \r\nwith the Council’s adoption by consensus of a draft \r\nresolution on civil society space, submitted by Japan, \r\nIreland, Tunisia, Chile and Sierra Leone this past \r\nSeptember. Member States need to ensure a safe and \r\nenabling environment where individuals from civil \r\nsociety are able to enjoy universally recognized human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe resources of the Council, including its budget, \r\nare stretched thin, owing to the increased number of \r\nresolutions and special procedures. On the one hand, \r\nwe must ensure that the Council has a budget for the \r\nnecessary mandates; on the other, we should consider \r\nhow the work of the Council can move forward bearing \r\nin mind the need to prevent the duplication of mandates \r\nand enhance its overall effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to reiterate that Japan will \r\ncontinue to conduct its diplomacy guided by universal \r\nvalues such as human rights and democracy. Japan will \r\nalso continue to fulfil its responsibility as a member of \r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nstrengthened safeguards and the gradual elimination of \r\nthat practice. \r\nLiechtenstein also welcomes the decision of the \r\nCouncil to act more decisively in order to address \r\nreprisals against persons who cooperate with its \r\nmechanisms and the Secretariat. The establishment \r\nof a high-level focal point will, we hope, contribute \r\nto the better protection of human rights defenders and \r\nvictims of human rights violations who have made the \r\nbrave decision to contribute to the work of the United \r\nNations. Reprisals are among the most destructive ways \r\nin which States violate their obligation to cooperate \r\nwith human rights procedures. The United Nations \r\ntherefore has a particular responsibility to protect those \r\nwho contribute to its work and should step up its efforts \r\nsubstantially in that regard.\r\nFinally, Liechtenstein expresses its ongoing support \r\nfor the Council as a forum in which emerging human \r\nrights problems find a place for discussion. Together \r\nwith a number of other States, Liechtenstein has been \r\npleased to initiate a broader dialogue on the human \r\nrights implications of current surveillance practices, \r\nwith a view to bringing them in line with internationally \r\nagreed standards, such as the right to privacy, as set \r\nout in the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights. We look forward to following up on those \r\ndiscussions in the framework of the Council and in the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Umemoto (Japan): I would like to express my \r\ngratitude to Mr. Remigiusz Henczel, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, for introducing the Council’s \r\nreport (A/68/53) today. Since its establishment, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has played an important role \r\nin promoting universal respect for the protection of all \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all. The \r\nCouncil has also steadily and steadfastly accumulated \r\nachievements as it responds actively to human rights \r\nviolations and makes recommendations thereon. For its \r\npart, the Government of Japan has made great efforts \r\nto strengthen the work and functioning of the Council.\r\nWe welcome and support the transparent and \r\nstrenuous activities of the various commissions of \r\ninquiry established by the Human Rights Council. We \r\nearnestly hope that those activities, despite various \r\nconstraints, will lead to the amelioration of global \r\nhuman rights situations by the international community. \r\nIn that connection, we appreciate the progress that \r\nhas been made, particularly in countries that have \r\nthe will to improve their human rights situation with \r\n13-56114 15/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nThe special procedures in the Council should be \r\nguided by respect for the principles of objectivity and \r\nimpartiality, and in general should respect the code of \r\nconduct adopted during the process of the Council’s \r\nformation as an institution. We should repeat that the \r\nholders of the special procedures mandates owe those \r\nmandates to the body that created them, and must report \r\nto it. They are not press agents and should not be engaged \r\nin media activity or in mobilizing opinion, which lies \r\noutside the purview of their mandate. They have an \r\nimportant role to play in keeping the intergovernmental \r\nbody informed. They should conduct their work with \r\na view to enhancing international cooperation on the \r\ntopics that form part of the Council’s priorities and on \r\nthose topics with regard to which the resolutions that \r\ncreated those special procedures were adopted.\r\nThe same should apply to the human rights treaty \r\nbodies, where, fortunately, more solid work has been \r\ndone. In them we have a mechanism and a focus on \r\ncooperation that we should preserve and always bear \r\nin mind, in order to ensure that we avoid irresponsible \r\ndecisions that could undermine the climate of \r\ncooperation that should prevail in the treaty bodies \r\nwhen we are dealing with the current process of reform \r\nof those entities.\r\nThe Council should ensure that the reaffirmation of \r\nthe right to international solidarity becomes an urgent \r\ngoal and not a chimera, as it is today, with the aim \r\nof tackling the serious challenges posed by the deep \r\neconomic, financial, energy, environmental and food \r\ncrisis affecting the world.\r\nCuba, which was a founding member of the Human \r\nRights Council and has just been re-elected to a term \r\nbeginning in January 2014, assumes its responsibilities \r\nby reaffirming its unswerving commitment to the \r\npromotion of and respect for human rights. We are \r\ngrateful to all for the trust thus conferred on our country. \r\nWe will continue to promote the rights of peoples to \r\nself-determination, peace and development and the \r\nright to food, and to seek to achieve the establishment \r\nof a democratic and equitable international order, \r\nfighting against racism, xenophobia and all forms \r\nof discrimination, as well as for cultural rights and \r\nrespect for diversity. In short, we seek to ensure that the \r\ncommon goal of a world that makes all human rights \r\navailable to all is no longer a chimera.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We would like to thank Mr. Remigiusz \r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwelcome our colleague and friend Remigiusz Henczel, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, and applaud his \r\noutstanding professionalism, permanent commitment \r\nand leadership in carrying out the work of the Council. \r\nWe also welcome our friend Eric Tistounet, who gave \r\nimmeasurable service to ensure the efficient work of \r\nthe Council and the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. \r\nThe Human Rights Council was born from the \r\nneed to address the problems of double standards, \r\nconfrontation and the political manipulation of its \r\npredecessor body, the Human Rights Commission. We \r\nmust prevent the repetition of such negative practices, \r\nwhich thoroughly discredited the old Commission. Cuba \r\nhas been very clear in its rejection of the imposition of \r\nsuch practices.\r\nNonetheless, we are concerned by the tendency \r\nof certain members to impose their own selectivity \r\nand double standards on the Council when it comes \r\nto questions of human rights, as can be clearly seen in \r\nmany of the initiatives adopted by the Council during \r\nthe period covered by the current report (A/68/53). \r\nCooperation and dialogue should guide the work of that \r\nbody.\r\nGiven that reality, the universal periodic review \r\nhas become the only universal mechanism free of \r\ndouble standards for the comprehensive analysis of \r\nhuman rights in all countries. It constitutes the major \r\nachievement of the Council in comparison with the \r\nold Human Rights Commission. The mechanism has \r\nproven itself as a means for international cooperation \r\non human rights based on constructive dialogue and \r\nrespect for the principles of universality, objectivity, \r\nimpartiality and non-selectivity.\r\nFor Cuba, as long as an unjust and exclusionary \r\ninternational economic and political order persists, \r\nthe Council must continue to advocate on behalf of a \r\ndemocratic and equitable international order. As long \r\nas egotism and glaring inequality prevail in the world, \r\nwe will have to continue to strive for international \r\nsolidarity. As long as unilateral coercive measures and \r\nthe kind of ironclad blockades under which Cuba has \r\nsuffered for more than 50 years continue to be imposed, \r\nthe Council must reject such practices and demand their \r\nend. And as long as hunger and malnutrition continue \r\nto steal the happiness and compromise the future of \r\nmillions of people, the Council will have to continue \r\nfighting for the right to food.\r\n16/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nIn that regard, I would like once again to \r\ndraw attention to such underlying principles of the \r\nCouncil as universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity, which are fully established in the \r\nframework of the universal periodic review procedure. \r\nAs a member of the Council, the Russian Federation \r\nwill continue to emphasize the significance of that \r\nunique mechanism of the Council. We firmly believe \r\nthat the same principles must be observed within the \r\nframework of the Council’s special procedures. In our \r\nview, it is essential that the special procedures must \r\ncomply clearly and strictly with the United Nations \r\ncode of conduct adopted by Member States.\r\nThe Russian Federation intends to cooperate \r\nconstructively with the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights on all issues \r\non its agenda. In our view, the main focus of the \r\nOffice’s work should be on strengthening dialogue \r\nand cooperation with all States concerned, in order to \r\nprovide them with the assistance required to ensure \r\nhuman rights and freedoms. Russia supports initiatives \r\naimed at creating greater cooperation between the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner, including on issues relating to planning, \r\nimplementing and rationalizing Office programmes at \r\nthe global, regional and country levels. We believe that \r\nthe relationship between the Council and the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner should be transparent and \r\nallow for clear feedback.\r\nMs. Najwa (Maldives): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwishes to thank His Excellency Mr. Remigiusz Henczel, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, for his presence \r\nhere today and for his introduction of the report of the \r\nCouncil to the General Assembly (A/68/53). As we \r\nreflect on an eventful and challenging year for the \r\nHuman Rights Council, I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s sincere appreciation for the leadership \r\ntaken by the Council on a number of issues of concern \r\nto the international community.\r\nLet me also express our profound gratitude to \r\nthe members of the Assembly for the wide support \r\ndisplayed yesterday when it re-elected the Maldives to \r\nthe Council for another term, beginning in January 2014 \r\n(see A/68/PV.51). When the Maldives was elected to the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2010 as the smallest country \r\nto occupy a seat, we took on the challenges ahead with \r\ngreat enthusiasm and a strong sense of commitment. \r\nSince then, we have continued to advocate for the \r\nprotection of basic human rights and fundamental \r\nHenczel, President of the Human Rights Council (HRC), \r\nfor introducing the report of the Council (A/68/53).\r\nThe Russian Federation considers the Council \r\nto be a key component of the international human \r\nrights system that promotes the development of \r\nconstructive international dialogue on matters with \r\na human dimension. We are pleased to see that, after \r\nparticipating in the Council this year as an observer, the \r\nRussian Federation was re-elected by an overwhelming \r\nmajority as a full member for the period 2014-2016. In \r\nmany ways, that was a result of the fact that during the \r\nperiod preceding its membership in the Council, the \r\nRussian Federation established itself as a reliable and \r\nresponsible partner in the area of human rights.\r\nWe intend to participate actively in the work of the \r\nCouncil in the future, cooperating constructively with \r\nall interested States. We will focus on the continued \r\nexpansion of the range of international obligations \r\nin the area of human rights. We plan to continue our \r\nconstructive cooperation with the HRC’s special \r\nprocedures and universal periodic review mechanism. \r\nAs far as thematic priorities are concerned, we \r\nintend, as before, to have the Council focus increased \r\nattention on issues related to combating racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and \r\non the prevention of human trafficking, the promotion of \r\nissues relating to business and human rights, traditional \r\nvalues and the integrity of the judicial system.\r\nWe have been compelled to conclude that the \r\nworrying trends that have become apparent in the \r\nwork of the Council in recent years continue to gain \r\nmomentum. Unfortunately, its work has often been \r\ncharacterized by the polarization of the interests of \r\nvarious groups of States. We still encounter attempts \r\nto divide States into the bad and the good, seriously \r\nhindering the objective and dispassionate discussion of \r\nissues on today’s international human rights agenda.\r\nWe believe that such an approach is fundamentally \r\nantithetical to the Council’s original purpose as a \r\nbody established to launch and develop dialogue and \r\ncooperation. The Council should work to the benefit of \r\nall United Nations Member States, without exception, \r\nnot serve one group’s tactical interests. Ultimately, we \r\nmust come to the realization that primary responsibility \r\nfor promoting and protecting human rights rests \r\nwith the States themselves, while the main task of \r\nthe international community is to provide them with \r\ntechnical assistance on request.\r\n13-56114 17/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nand facilitate positive outcomes in such situations. We \r\nare, therefore, encouraged by the ongoing efforts of the \r\nCouncil to provide technical assistance to countries in \r\nneed, and we hope that it can built upon that assistance \r\nin the future. In that connection, we call upon all States \r\nin the process of transition and undergoing situations of \r\nunrest to work closely with international human rights \r\nbodies and with the international community, establish \r\nthe necessary institutions, including independent \r\njudiciaries and credible human rights mechanisms, \r\nand ensure the creation of inclusive and democratic \r\nsystems of governance. Inclusion and dialogue are the \r\nway forward.\r\nSince undergoing our own transition to a \r\ndemocratic system of governance five years ago, the \r\nMaldives continues to be active in the area of human \r\nrights. We have used our own experience to firmly \r\nadhere to human rights principles, and based on those \r\nguiding principles, we have been able to participate \r\nactively at the international level, including through \r\nthe various initiatives that the Maldives has led in the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Based on our experience, we \r\nfirmly believe in the need for more engagement with \r\ninternational bodies, including the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We recognize the need for small States such \r\nas the Maldives to be heard in the large arenas.\r\nIn that regard, in 2012, with the support of a cross-\r\nregional group of partners, the Maldives took a lead \r\nrole in establishing the Voluntary Fund for Financial \r\nand Technical Assistance aimed at supporting the \r\nparticipation of the least developed countries and the \r\nsmall island developing States at the Council. We are \r\npleased to note that the Fund is finally in operation. \r\nThe universal periodic review (UPR) is a unique \r\npeer review mechanism that directly contributes \r\nto the efforts of States to promote and uphold their \r\nhuman rights obligations. It also provides an objective, \r\ntransparent and constructive cooperative framework \r\nfor States to exchange views and interact on human \r\nrights issues.\r\nWe fully support and reaffirm the Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution that established the universal \r\nperiodic review mechanism. While adequate steps must \r\nbe taken to encourage States to participate, the Maldives \r\nbelieves that there must be appropriate measures to \r\nenable the Council to move forward with the review, \r\neven if States decide not to cooperate. The Maldives \r\nalso believes that engagement in the UPR process \r\nprovides countries with an opportunity to improve their \r\nfreedoms for all peoples in general, and specifically for \r\nthe voiceless and marginalized.\r\nOur membership in the Council for the past \r\nthree years has been a catalyst for positive change \r\ndomestically and has provided the right impetus for \r\ntaking bold steps to protect and promote human rights \r\nin the country, including, inter alia, enacting important \r\npieces of legislation, such as the Disabilities Act and the \r\nDomestic Violence Act, ratifying international human \r\nrights instruments such as all of the core conventions \r\nof the International Labour Organization and the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and \r\nacceding to the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime. We firmly believe \r\nthat our continued tenure on the Council will give us \r\nan opportunity to enhance and accelerate efforts to \r\nconsolidate democracy and protect and promote human \r\nrights in our society.\r\nHowever, while we are proud of the progress we \r\nhave made, we recognize the challenges that lie ahead as \r\nwe strive to achieve those objectives for the Maldivian \r\npeople. First and foremost, we must further strengthen \r\nour human rights institutions and ensure that we have a \r\nfunctioning, responsible and independent judiciary that \r\nunderstands its role as a protector of the rule of law and \r\nhuman rights. We must endeavour to increase women’s \r\nparticipation in both the public and the private sectors. \r\nWe must ensure greater protection for our children and \r\nprovide our youth with education and opportunities \r\nto contribute to the progress of society. But above all, \r\nwe must try to build resilience and cultivate the value \r\nof the respect for human rights within our society in \r\norder to complement the formal and statutory measures \r\nalready in place.\r\nAs described in the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the year 2013 has been an eventful one, with \r\nthe escalation of violence and the deterioration in the \r\nhuman rights situations in various corners of the world. \r\nWhether those violations of human rights are a result \r\nof civil war in Syria, occupation in the Palestinian \r\nand Arab territories or ethnic and communal tensions \r\nelsewhere, we call on all parties involved to cease all \r\nongoing violence and to engage in dialogue aimed at \r\nreaching a lasting peace. We also encourage countries \r\nundergoing transition to work towards substantive \r\nreforms, strengthen democratic institutions and ensure \r\nthe protection of their people from all forms of abuse.\r\nIt is the work and the mandate of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, and the United Nations as a whole, to assist \r\n18/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nCouncil for introducing the Council’s report (A/68/53) \r\nand, more generally, for the efficient and positive \r\nmanner in which he is fulfilling his mandate. We \r\nwelcome the higher profile that human rights in general \r\nand the Human Rights Council in particular have \r\nassumed within the United Nations system.\r\nSwitzerland has supported the Human Rights \r\nCouncil from its very beginning. Similarly, five years \r\nlater, it supported the establishment of the review \r\nprocess. It is extremely important to ensure that that \r\nmechanism is able to continue to fulfil the objectives \r\nfor which the international community created it, \r\nnamely, to strengthen, promote and protect the human \r\nrights of all and to address specific situations of human \r\nrights violations. Most of the recent crises were first \r\ntaken up by the Human Rights Council, before being \r\nconsidered by the Security Council. We can therefore \r\nsay that the Human Rights Council is more relevant and \r\ncentral than ever to making the world a more peaceful \r\nplace.\r\nSwitzerland also notes with satisfaction that the \r\nuniversal periodic review (UPR) process has taken deep \r\nroot in the Human Rights Council. That mechanism is \r\nunique in its form as a peer review that ensures equal \r\ntreatment of all countries when it comes to assessing \r\ntheir practices in the field of human rights. At the \r\nsame time, it provides the international community \r\nwith a regular review of the human rights records of \r\nall Member States of the United Nations. We can say \r\nthat up to now the cooperation between States and the \r\nHuman Rights Council in the universal period review \r\nprocess has generally worked well, with every State \r\ntaking its responsibilities seriously and ensuring its full \r\nparticipation in the review. \r\nHowever, if we want the UPR process to become a \r\nmore effective and credible human rights mechanism \r\nin the long term, it must become deeply rooted at the \r\nnational level. We therefore call on States to ensure \r\nthe implementation of the recommendations made \r\nin the course of their reviews through a transparent, \r\ncomprehensive and participatory implementation \r\nprocess and by informing the international community \r\nabout the steps they have taken in that regard. \r\nSwitzerland is convinced that only the commitment of \r\nall States Members of the United Nations can ensure \r\nthe effectiveness of this promising process.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the increased engagement \r\nof States and civil society within the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and their readiness to launch new initiatives \r\nhuman rights situations. But we should also ensure that \r\ntechnical and other advisory assistance is provided to \r\ncountries to implement recommendations.\r\nToday, as the Maldives celebrates its election \r\nto the Human Rights Council for a second term, we \r\npledge our continued support to the cause of promoting \r\nand protecting human rights, and we wish to assure \r\nthe international community that we will continue \r\nour work domestically and internationally with the \r\nsame enthusiasm and sense of commitment that we \r\nembraced when we were first elected. In the Council \r\nthe Maldives will continue to forge strong partnerships \r\nwith all relevant international stakeholders with a view \r\nto attaining an effective and results-oriented global \r\nhuman rights protection system in line with the five key \r\nprinciples that we wholeheartedly believe in, namely, \r\nfirst, that human rights are inviolable and universal and \r\nthat the promotion and protection of human rights across \r\nthe globe must be done in a non-selective, equitable \r\nand non-politicized manner; secondly, that human \r\nrights remain central at the domestic and international \r\nlevels; thirdly, that dialogue and partnership between \r\ncountries and other actors is of utmost importance; \r\nfourthly, that human rights must be realized for all \r\npeoples, regardless of nationality, religion or ethnicity; \r\nand finally, that an objective assessment to improve \r\nhuman rights standards around the world in a balanced, \r\nfair and independent manner must be pursued.\r\nIn the days ahead, the Maldives would like to \r\nsee an end to violence and a stronger focus on human \r\nrights in countries where violence and unrest prevails. \r\nWe would like to see emerging democracies build \r\nhuman rights resilience and work towards creating \r\na culture of respect for human rights. We would like \r\nto see the global community put more emphasis on \r\nand effort into protecting and respecting our natural \r\nenvironment, achieving greater equality for women and \r\nstrengthening the protection of the rights of children \r\nand the disabled. The Maldives calls upon all States \r\nto fully engage and cooperate with the United Nations \r\nand human rights mechanisms. We stand ready to lend \r\nour assistance and extend our continued commitment \r\nto improving human rights protection, both at home \r\nand abroad. We look forward to continuing our positive \r\nactivism in the Human Rights Council, through which \r\nwe hope to contribute to creating a world that gives \r\ngreater recognition to and respect for human rights.\r\nMr. Seger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland thanks the President of the Human Rights \r\n13-56114 19/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nthe institutions located in Geneva and expresses its full \r\ncooperation with the Human Rights Council.\r\nSheikha Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express our appreciation to \r\nMr. Henczel, President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nfor introducing the Council’s comprehensive report \r\n(A/68/53) this morning. We also congratulate the \r\ncountries elected yesterday as members of the Council.\r\nThe Human Rights Council plays an important, \r\npivotal role in the promotion and protection of all \r\nhuman rights and all fundamental freedoms without \r\ndiscrimination and in a fair and equitable manner. \r\nGiven the tragic changes and political and intellectual \r\ntransformation in the world today, which have deepened \r\ndivisions as a result of tensions and instability \r\nand the deterioration of human rights situations in \r\nmany countries, we need, more than ever before, \r\nto stress the importance of impartiality, objectivity \r\nand non-selectivity in the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil.\r\nUndoubtedly, more than seven years since \r\nits establishment, the Council continues to work \r\neffectively and to play a crucial role in addressing \r\nhuman rights violations. Its role as a major pillar in \r\ninternational mechanisms to promote human rights \r\nhas increased. As we start the second round of the \r\nuniversal periodic review, it is important to provide \r\nfunding for the Councils’ activities so that it can avoid \r\nthe shortcomings of the previous session.\r\nQatar, thanks to its wise leadership, has attached \r\nprimary importance to the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights in line with our Strategic Vision 2030, \r\nwhich includes the promotion of a safe and stable society \r\nbased on the principles of equality, justice and the rule \r\nof law and promoting human rights at the regional and \r\ninternational levels. \r\nOnce again, we would like to stress that ever since \r\nwe became a member of the Council in 2008, we have \r\nhonoured our commitments in the field of universal \r\nvalues and human rights. We have fully cooperated \r\nwith the Council in order to enhance and strenghten the \r\npromotion of human rights. We have adopted a policy \r\nthat focuses on the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights. We have also hosted a centre of documentation \r\non human rights for the Arab and Western Asia region, \r\nwhich has improved our performance at the national, \r\nregional and international levels by helping us develop \r\nthe institutional and legal framework to protect human \r\nand to establish new mechanisms. One of the direct \r\noutcomes of that engagement, as stated in the report, \r\nwas the Human Rights Council’s adoption of more than \r\n100 resolutions in 2013, twice as many as six years ago. \r\nWe all know that a resolution can have a real \r\nimpact only if it is properly implemented. That is why \r\nSwitzerland believes it is now time for the Council to \r\nstart focusing more on implementation processes, since \r\none of the reasons for the creation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil was to address the gap in implementing human \r\nrights on a global scale.\r\nMany of the resolutions make it necessary to convene \r\nnew meetings and committees of experts to establish \r\nnew mandates. At the same time, the resources that \r\nthe Secretary-General requested the Fifth Committee \r\nto provide for the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to \r\nmaintain the Council’s secretariat fall far short of the \r\nneeds, which continue to grow. That disparity between \r\ndemands and available resources has already resulted \r\nin a cutback in existing OHCHR field operations, the \r\nshelving of new ones and the abandonment of regional \r\nand international projects. \r\nIn that context, we regret that OHCHR’s proposal \r\nfor the 2014-2015 budget, which will be discussed \r\nat the Fifth Committee in the coming days, does not \r\nreflect that pressing need for additional resources and, \r\ninstead, proposes cuts. We consider that this situation \r\nconsiderably weakens the desire to make human rights \r\na reality for all. We believe that without additional \r\nresources, the legacy of the major projects that have \r\nbeen undertaken and the commitments we have seen in \r\nthe implementation of human rights may be undermined \r\nin the long term.\r\nTherefore, Switzerland urges States to mobilize \r\nwithin the Fifth Committee in order to significantly \r\nstrengthen financing from the regular budget for the \r\nactivities of the Council. The shortfall in this area is \r\nsignificant, even though human rights are one of the \r\nthree pillars of the work of the United Nations. However, \r\nless than 3 per cent of the Organization’s regular budget \r\nis allocated to human rights.\r\nThe Human Rights Council, along with the \r\nmonitoring and implementation bodies, including the \r\nOHCHR, contribute to making Geneva the world’s \r\ncapital for the protection of human rights. The Council’s \r\nPresident can count on the full commitment and support \r\nof Switzerland. My country will continue to strengthen \r\n20/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\n(A/68/53). Costa Rica reiterates its full commitment to, \r\nand support for, the work of the Human Rights Council \r\nas the central body of the United Nations on that matter. \r\nThe plenary of the General Assembly must consider \r\nthe entirety of its report, which reveals that despite the \r\nmany challenges encountered, the Council has been \r\nable to live up to its mandate appropriately.\r\nParticular reference should be made to the work \r\nand good offices of the President to preserve the \r\nuniversality of the universal periodic review (UPR). \r\nWe urge all States to continue to participate in the \r\nsecond UPR cycle with the same enthusiasm that was \r\napparent during the first cycle, and to commit at the \r\nhighest level to implement its recommendations. It is \r\nalso essential to formulate increasingly precise and \r\nconcrete recommendations, and seek cooperation \r\nmechanisms to build the necessary national capacities \r\nfor implementation.\r\nAs a responsible member of the Council, Costa Rica \r\nhas remained active and committed to its work, building \r\npurposeful alliances with countries in different regions, \r\npromoting major initiatives and encouraging dialogue \r\nin negotiations. Over the past year, we have championed \r\nmajor resolutions in the Council, on which we reached \r\nconsensus, such as those relating to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights in the context of peaceful \r\ndemonstrations, on which we worked together with \r\nSwitzerland and Turkey, and on conscientious objection \r\nto military service, where we were a major sponsor with \r\nCroatia and Poland. The latter was the first resolution \r\nof a substantive nature to be adopted by the Council on \r\nthat subject.\r\nCosta Rica also continues its traditional collective \r\nwork in human rights education and training, with the \r\nresolution on the World Programme on the subject, \r\nwhose third phase will focus on journalists and other \r\nmedia workers. In that connection, we had the honour \r\nto work with Italy, Morocco, Slovenia, Senegal, \r\nSwitzerland and the Philippines, as well as the nearly \r\n80 other sponsors of the resolution.\r\nIn addition, along with Ecuador and Peru, we \r\nworked on a robust but inclusive draft resolution on \r\nthe impact of arms transfers on human rights in armed \r\nconflict. We also promoted a round table on capital \r\npunishment, together with Benin, France, Mongolia \r\nand the Republic of Moldova. We continue to promote \r\nthe development of the themes of human rights and the \r\nenvironment, working with countries such as Maldives \r\nand Switzerland.\r\nrights. We have adopted a comprehensive approach to \r\ndealing with human rights at the national level, in terms \r\nof education, health and gender equality, as well as the \r\nprotection of migrant workers.\r\nThere are many items on the agenda of the Human \r\nRights Council, especially concerning the Arab world. \r\nUnfortunately, the human rights situation in our \r\nregion, especially in the Palestinian territories, has not \r\nwitnessed any improvement. Despite repeated calls for \r\nthe Israeli authorities to promote the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of the Palestinian people, its \r\nofficials continue to allow illegal practices that violate \r\ninternational humanitarian law and international \r\nlaw. Those include the oppressive detention and \r\nimprisonment of Palestinians, including children, and \r\nthe demolition of homes. We are concerned about the \r\nsuffocation of the Palestinian economy and the fact \r\nthat Palestinians are being deprived of water, in blatant \r\nviolation of international law, especially the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. The deteriorating \r\nhumanitarian situation in Gaza and Israeli coercive \r\nmeasures and practices increase the hardship and \r\nsuffering of Palestinian refugees. That should serve to \r\nremind the international community of the importance \r\nof our full support to the Palestinian people and the call \r\nfor righting the historic injustice to which they have \r\nbeen subjected.\r\nWe call on the Council to respond to the alarming \r\nsituation in the Syrian Arab Republic, especially the \r\nrepeated violations of human rights, war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity. The report of the Council-\r\nmandated Independent International Commission \r\nof Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic — which \r\nwas not allowed to enter the country to discharge its \r\nmandat — highlighted the increasing human rights \r\nviolations in Syria. Such practices have made Syria a \r\nbattleground of destruction and violence. That is why \r\nthe international community should take all measures \r\nnecessary in order to protect the human rights of the \r\nSyrian people.\r\nWe also emphasize that we will continue to \r\ncooperate with the mechanisms of the Council. We \r\nhope the Council will achieve even more in the coming \r\nyear.\r\nMr. Ulibarri (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwould like to thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for his presentation. We welcome the reports \r\non the essential work performed by the Council in \r\ndifferent subject areas and in all parts of the world \r\n13-56114 21/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nwe were pleased to receive the visit, in the middle of \r\nthis year, of Mr. John Knox, Independent Expert on \r\nthe issue of human rights obligations relating to the \r\nenjoyment of a safe, clean, healthy and sustainable \r\nenvironment. We look forward to his report.\r\nWe will continue to carry out the functions \r\nentrusted to us by the members of the Council, guided \r\nby universality, impartiality, objectivity, non-selectivity \r\nand non-politicization, in constructive international \r\ndialogue in a spirit cooperation.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, we respectfully ask \r\nfor support for our desire to be re-elected for the period \r\n2014-2017.\r\nMr. Och (Mongolia): Let me first that this \r\nopportunity to thank Ambassador Henczel, President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, for introducing the annual \r\nreport of the Council (A/68/53). \r\nThe importance of the matters before the Council \r\nfor decision stimulates all Member States to try to \r\ndevelop greater international cooperation in the \r\npromotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nacross the world. The promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights is one of the main pillars of the foreign \r\npolicy of Mongolia. Mongolia’s principled position \r\nwas affirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his \r\naddress to the high-level segment of the twenty-second \r\nsession of the Human Rights Council.\r\nThe Government of Mongolia is undertaking legal \r\nreforms to harmonize its national laws with international \r\nnorms and standards. That inclusive process, with \r\nthe active participation of civil society, includes the \r\nestablishment of adequate national mechanisms, the \r\nadoption of relevant national programmes and the \r\nimprovement of institutional capacity.\r\nAs a country that adopted a nationally specific \r\nninth Millennium Development Goal, on strengthening \r\nhuman rights and fostering democratic governance, \r\nMongolia recognizes the centrality of human rights in \r\ndevelopment planning and acknowledges that human \r\nrights, the rule of law and democracy are interlinked \r\nand mutually reinforcing. We are thankful to the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights for the support that it has extended to Mongolia \r\nduring its presidency of the Community of Democracies \r\nfrom 2011 to2013. We welcomed the message from \r\nMs. Navanethem Pillay and the participation by the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly \r\nand association in the seventh Ministerial Conference \r\nWe believe that the Human Rights Council is \r\nthe appropriate forum for undertaking high-quality \r\ndiscussions on issues over which we might have \r\ndiverging views, but where we can find points of \r\nagreement to bolster the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nFor Costa Rica it is very important to guarantee \r\ncoherence between our foreign policy on human rights \r\nand our domestic policy on the subject. For that reason, \r\nwe continue our efforts to improve the human rights \r\nsituation of all our inhabitants, while maintaining the \r\nhigh standards that we are known for historically. We \r\ninvest greatly in social development. Our office of the \r\npeople’s advocate, a national independent human rights \r\nbody, has a constitutional jurisdiction for providing \r\neffective remedies and simple and direct access, such as \r\nrecourse to refuge, to protect all human rights. Among \r\nour most recent achievements on this front, we would \r\nlist the following.\r\nFirst, we have implemented a comprehensive \r\nnational programme on emotional health and sexuality. \r\nSecondly, there is new legislation against trafficking \r\nin persons, which provides new tools for action by the \r\nauthorities and establishes major penalties against labour \r\nexploitation, sex tourism and trafficking in organs, \r\ntissues and body f luids. Thirdly, we have established \r\na round table for dialogue among representatives \r\nof indigenous peoples and senior Government \r\nrepresentatives. Fourthly, a decree has been issued that \r\nrecognizes seven native languages  of the indigenous \r\npeoples of Costa Rica and establishes the right of \r\nindigenous students to have the local culture and their \r\nworldview incorporated into educational curriculums. \r\nLastly, our parliament has approved the Third Optional \r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, \r\nregarding a communications procedure.\r\nOur country’s work is guided by principles \r\nand seeks to promote and protect all human rights, \r\nwhether civil, cultural, economic, political or social, \r\nin all circumstances and in every place. We encourage \r\ndialogue and cross-regional alliances, and we build \r\nbridges to contribute to the effective implementation of \r\nCouncil decisions and resolutions.\r\nAs Chair of the Council’s Working Group on the \r\nRight to Peace, we have made progress on a strategy \r\nthat is transparent, inclusive, consensual and objective \r\nthat seeks consensus on this important and still \r\ncontroversial subject. We maintain an open invitation \r\nto all United Nations special procedures. In that regard, \r\n22/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nplan of action to implement the UPR recommendations \r\nand collaborates with other stakeholders in the \r\nimplementation process, including consultations with \r\nthe National Human Rights Commission, civil society \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme.\r\nThe principles of non-selectivity, practicality, \r\ntimeliness and effectiveness with regard to the human \r\nrights issues and situations of human rights violations \r\nare of crucial importance. We welcome open dialogue on \r\nensuring transparency, independence and inclusiveness \r\nin the work of the Council, as well as on strengthening \r\ntreaty bodies.\r\nSignificant progress was made under the ongoing \r\nopen-ended intergovernmental process towards \r\nidentifying concrete and sustainable measures needed \r\nto strengthen and enhance the effective functioning of \r\nthe human rights treaty bodies system. My delegation \r\nsupports the extension of the process and welcomes \r\ninitiatives on the improvement of the working methods \r\nof the system and the effective participation of Member \r\nStates in the treaty implementation reporting process. \r\nMy delegation is prepared to take active part in the \r\ndiscussions on the ways forward recommended by the \r\nco-facilitators of the process.\r\nWe welcome the mandate of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to promote advisory services, technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building in the implementation \r\nof human rights instruments. We note the need of \r\nsmall countries for greater institutional capacity \r\nand improved professional skills to participate in the \r\nprocess of improving the Council and strengthening \r\ntreaty bodies.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to continued cooperation \r\nand readiness for enhanced dialogue with the Council. \r\nMongolia aspires to become a responsible and \r\ncommitted actor in the activities of the Council. We \r\nmaintain our standing invitation to all international \r\nhuman rights mechanisms.\r\nWe emphasize that international cooperation \r\nin the field of human rights is essential for the full \r\nachievement of the purposes of the United Nations as \r\ndeclared in the Vienna Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action. Mongolia supports positioning the Council \r\nas a platform for enhanced and open discussion and \r\nbetter international cooperation on the various complex \r\nissues with positive implications for national policies \r\non human rights.\r\nof the Community of Democracies. My delegation also \r\nexpresses its appreciation to fellow Member States \r\nfor their support of resolution 67/18, on education for \r\ndemocracy, which was presented by Mongolia.\r\nMongolia has submitted its candidature to the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the term of 2016-2018 for the \r\nfirst time. Mongolia is guided by the aspiration to make \r\na meaningful contribution to the promotion of human \r\nrights and freedoms at the regional and international \r\nlevels. We are willing to share our experience with \r\nothers. By ratifying and implementing over 30 human \r\nrights instruments, including seven core conventions, \r\nMongolia demonstrated its strong commitment to the \r\nstrengthening of the international human rights system. \r\nLast year Mongolia ratified the Second Optional \r\nProtocol to the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights, which seeks the abolition of the death \r\npenalty.\r\nAccordingly, our domestic legislation will be \r\namended to permanently eliminate capital punishment. \r\nMongolia became a sponsor of resolution 62/149, \r\nentitled “Moratorium on the use of the death penalty”, \r\nand joined the initiative launched in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to organize the high-level panel discussion on \r\nthe question of the death penalty during the twenty-\r\nfifth session of the Council. Mongolia signed the \r\nInternational Convention for the Protection of All \r\nPersons from Enforced Disappearances and recently \r\nsigned the Optional Protocol to the Convention against \r\nTorture and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child on a communications procedure.\r\nOur Government consistently supports the work \r\nof special mandate holders, welcomes the expansion \r\nof the mandates and is ready to cooperate and assist \r\nSpecial Rapporteurs by ensuring the completion of \r\ntheir independent mandates and providing them with \r\nfollow-up information. The latest visit of the Special \r\nRapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights was \r\nextremely important and useful, and we expect a visit \r\nby the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human \r\nrights defenders.\r\nMongolia recognizes the unique role played by \r\nthe universal periodic review (UPR) mechanism in \r\nproviding the means to submit a comprehensive report \r\non the human rights situations in all Member States. \r\nWe commend the efforts of the Council to improve \r\nthe working methods of the Working Group on the \r\nuniversal periodic review. The Government adopted a \r\n13-56114 23/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nto help countries. That will in particular benefit least \r\ndeveloped countries and help them implement the \r\nrecommendations emanating from their reviews.\r\nSecondly, while there has been some progress in \r\naddressing the eradication of poverty brought about \r\nby widening inequality, high and volatile food and \r\nfuel prices and menacing environmental risks, such \r\nprogress continues to be held hostage to the impact \r\nof the global financial and economic crisis. Malaysia \r\nis of the view that despite the bleak world economic \r\nsituation, developed countries should, to the best \r\nof their ability, fulfil their pledges made in terms of \r\nofficial development assistance. Even without the \r\ncurrent economic crisis, developing countries have \r\nstruggled to ensure that the economic and social rights \r\nof their peoples were upheld. Thus, they, including the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable sectors of society, are now \r\neven worse off with the knock-on effects of the crisis.\r\nThirdly, Malaysia welcomes the Council’s continued \r\nattention to the human rights situation of the Palestinian \r\npeople in the occupied Palestinian territory. We must \r\nnever forget that the core issue for the Palestinians is \r\ntheir inalienable right to statehood. Malaysia calls for \r\nthe realization of the right of the Palestinians to self-\r\ndetermination through a final solution to the conflict \r\nthat would ensure the creation of two States living side \r\nby side in peace and security and based on the 1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as the capital for the \r\nPalestinian State. We urge the Council to continue to \r\npress on the issue and to ensure that Palestinians are \r\nafforded their basic rights as human beings, including \r\ntheir right to an independent State.\r\nFourthly, on the process of strengthening and \r\nenhancing the effective functioning of the human rights \r\ntreaty bodies system, in view of the complexity of \r\nhuman rights issues, Malaysia believes that the intricate \r\nresponsibility to promote and protect human rights \r\nnecessitates deeper cooperation among stakeholders. \r\nWhile human rights treaty bodies are in place to keep \r\na check and balance over States parties’ compliance \r\nand efforts to improve related human rights situations, \r\nit is apparent that there are still significant issues to \r\nbe addressed to assist those bodies to fulfil their \r\nobjectives. Malaysia remains committed to continue \r\nsupporting efforts aimed at strengthening the human \r\nrights treaty bodies.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that the Council will carry \r\non its good work in promoting and protecting human \r\nrights for all. It should not yield to the agendas of certain \r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): My delegation warmly \r\nwelcomes Ambassador Henczel, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, to the General Assembly to \r\nintroduce the report of the Council (A/68/53). \r\nMalaysia, together with the international \r\ncommunity, places high expectations on the work of \r\nthe Council. Malaysia believes in a non-confrontational \r\napproach to the issue of human rights, pushing instead \r\nfor constructive dialogue and cooperation. The current \r\ninternational trend of politicizing human rights by \r\nsome has not served the cause of human rights. Some \r\ncountries continue to emphasize political and civil \r\nrights to the virtual exclusion of economic, social and \r\ncultural rights. Malaysia is of the view that civil and \r\npolitical rights cannot be separated from economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights, as they are two sides of the \r\nsame coin.\r\nAllow me to touch on a few matters relating to the \r\nCouncil. First, the universal periodic review (UPR) is \r\na primary human rights mechanism, premised upon the \r\nequal treatment of all countries. Malaysia is pleased \r\nto report that the country successfully underwent its \r\nsecond UPR round in October 2013. A total of 104 \r\nMember States participated in the interactive dialogue \r\non Malaysia’s UPR. As a result, Malaysia received \r\na total of 232 recommendations on how to further \r\npromote and improve the human rights situation in the \r\ncountry. Recommendations addressed to Malaysia will \r\nbe thoroughly studied and considered by the relevant \r\nministries and agencies. Malaysia will announce its \r\ndecisions on the recommendations received when its \r\nfinal report is presented for adoption by the Human \r\nRights Council at its twenty-fifth session in March \r\n2014.\r\nMalaysia took full advantage of the opportunity \r\nafforded by the UPR to update Member States on the \r\npositive developments pertaining to the measures that \r\nhave been undertaken by the Government to improve \r\nand enhance human rights in the country. During its \r\nUPR, Malaysia did not attempt to hide any domestic \r\nshortcomings and openly admitted the challenges faced \r\nby the Government in its efforts to further promote and \r\nprotect human rights.\r\nTo ensure the full participation of all countries \r\nto the UPR process, Malaysia is of the view that the \r\nVoluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, \r\nestablished by the Council in its resolution 6/17, \r\nshould be strengthened and put to work in order to \r\nprovide a source of financial and technical assistance \r\n24/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nviolations of human rights in some developing countries \r\nbut fails to do so in other countries. The Council \r\ndisregards the mechanisms responsible for monitoring \r\nhuman rights situations and their violations in developed \r\nStates. Racism reigns in those influential countries, as \r\nwell xenophobia, racial discrimination, discrimination \r\nagainst indigenous peoples and discrimination against \r\nimmigrants, as well as cruel and inhumane treatment of \r\ndetainees and refugees in countries that have militarily \r\ninvaded other sovereign countries. Those countries \r\nhave violated the right to development by imposing \r\nrestrictive unilateral economic measures against the \r\npopulations of developing countries, in addition to \r\nexpressly sponsoring terrorism.\r\nThe resolutions on Syria mentioned in the Human \r\nRights Council report are based on media information \r\nfrom a single source. The resolutions are in harmony \r\nwith the political trends in certain States, which only \r\nwant ill for Syria and its Government and its people. \r\nNone of those resolutions have called for ending the \r\nterrorism carried out by armed terrorist groups, nor do \r\nthey call for them to be disarmed. Those resolutions do \r\nnot call on the countries that finance and support them \r\nto end their military, political and media support. Their \r\nsupport is through the Sanctions Committee of the \r\nSecurity Council — and the Security Council records \r\nmention those States by name and show all the weapons \r\ngoing into Syria and what borders the weapons crossed. \r\nIn addition, the sponsors of the resolutions, who claim \r\nto defend human rights in Syria, do not talk about \r\nthe deterioration of the economic and humanitarian \r\nsituation in Syria, which is a result of the restrictive \r\nunilateral economic measures imposed by the States \r\nof the European Union, the League of Arab States and \r\nthe United States. Those measures are a threat to the \r\nsovereignty and independence of States and a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nprinciples of human rights. \r\nEvery year the General Assembly adopts resolutions \r\nagainst unjust, restrictive and arbitrary unilateral \r\neconomic measures. Despite that, some Member States \r\nof the Organization insist on the imposition of such \r\nunilateral sanctions, which are considered punishment. \r\nThat continues in spite of the report of the Independent \r\nCommission of Inquiry, a subsidiary body of the Human \r\nRights Council. The report lists the effects of those \r\neconomic measures on the welfare of the Syrian people, \r\nand says there are various armed terrorist groups \r\ncommitting acts of violence and terrorism against the \r\nSyrian people. It is therefore clear today that there are \r\nquarters. The many achievements to date, including the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the UPR mechanism, have \r\nserved to put the Council in good stead, especially in its \r\nmandate to ensure greater promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights for all. However, Malaysia believes that \r\nmore can always be done to enhance and uphold the \r\nrights of victims of human rights violations. Malaysia \r\nis committed to that end and will continue to strongly \r\nsupport the work of the Council.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): We would like to begin by welcoming the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Mr. Henczel, \r\nto New York. We wish him every success in the \r\nimportant tasks entrusted to him. He can count on our \r\nconstructive cooperation to ensure that human rights \r\nare dealt with on an equal footing and in a fair manner, \r\nwithout the politicization, oppression and double \r\nstandards that have eroded our achievements in New \r\nYork and Geneva.\r\nWe have read the Human Rights Council’s report \r\n(A/68/53) very closely and with great interest. The \r\nreport touches on a series of matters that are extremely \r\nimportant, particularly with regard to violations of \r\nhuman rights in the occupied Arab territories, including \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan and the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories. Forty-five years have passed since the \r\nunjust Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan. In spite \r\nof the Council’s call on Israel, the occupying Power, to \r\nimplement the resolutions of all United Nations bodies \r\nand agencies — including, of course, the Commission \r\non Human Rights, which became the Human Rights \r\nCouncil — Israel continues to defy the will of Member \r\nStates. Israel refuses to adhere to the hundreds of such \r\nresolutions. The Israeli authorities have perpetrated war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, and they expressly \r\nclaim those crimes with no sense of accountability or \r\npunishment. They do so despite numerous questions \r\nfrom international public officials and certain capitals \r\nregarding the Israeli exception: the reasons for Israel \r\nnot being subject to prosecution and not being brought \r\nto justice.\r\nWe are concerned by the attempts by some to \r\nturn the Human Rights Council into a private entity \r\nthat serves political agendas that are very narrow in \r\nnature — serving the agendas of influential States — in \r\ncontradiction to the spirit prevailing at the establishment \r\nof the Council and its mandate. That was made clear \r\nin the adoption of resolutions with political objectives \r\nand dimensions in which the Council condemns the \r\n13-56114 25/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\ndiscrimination. That was the reason we arrived at \r\nthe principle of the universal periodic review of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Those resolutions will be an \r\nobstacle to the objective role that some have taken on \r\nat the international level in order to settle the Syrian \r\ncrisis. Indeed, they will encourage greater rigidity \r\nover holding a “Geneva II” conference and the ongoing \r\narmed violence, killing and bloodshed. They block the \r\nsigns of cooperation and overtures from Syria, which \r\nwas made very clear recently with the International \r\nCommission.\r\nI would also like to speak about what has been said by \r\nthe representatives of Qatar and Kuwait. Qatar’s f lagrant \r\ninterference in Syria’s internal affairs is a fact that has \r\nbeen condemned by Member States. That interference \r\nin our domestic affairs has been manifested in financial \r\nand media support for terrorism, and by training \r\nterrorists and recruiting them from every region of the \r\nglobe. They have been transported en masse through \r\nTurkey and Jordan in order to carry out terrorist acts in \r\nSyria that have resulted in tens of thousands of victims \r\nand destroyed 50 per cent of Syria’s infrastructure. The \r\nrepresentative of Qatar described the situation in Syria \r\nas dangerous and terrifying, but she does not know that \r\nthe Qatari authorities are responsible for that terrifying \r\nsituation, which has harmed thousands of Syrians. The \r\nQatari authorities condemned a Qatari poet to a life \r\nsentence for writing a poem criticizing the former Emir. \r\nAfter the new Emir was installed, the poet’s sentence \r\nwas commuted from life imprisonment to 15 years. We \r\nare talking here about the human rights situation in the \r\nState of Qatar.\r\nConcerning Kuwait, I will read a single paragraph \r\npublished today in The New York Times, from an article \r\non the Gulf States’ financing of Kuwaiti Salafists and \r\njihadists in Syria. The article quotes a Kuwaiti Salafist \r\nwho collects funds for aiding terrorists in Syria. His \r\nname is Al-Mteiri. \r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“‘Once upon a time we cooperated with the \r\nAmericans in Iraq,’ said Mr. Al-Mteiri, a former \r\nsoldier in the Kuwaiti Army, recalling the American \r\nrole in pushing Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991.”\r\nThen Al-Mteiri says, “Now we want to get Bashar out \r\nof Syria, so why not cooperate with Al-Qaida?” He \r\nacknowledges that he is cooperating with Al-Qaida.\r\nBy the way, Al-Qaida is listed on the Security \r\nCouncil list of entities and individuals sponsoring \r\ncapitals that boast about rejecting a peaceful solution to \r\nthe situation in Syria, and those States admit explicitly \r\nto arming terrorist groups. They are working to directly \r\ntrain those groups in States that are neighbours of Syria.\r\nMy country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis \r\nwhose causes are now well known. Terrorism has struck \r\nmy country through systematic violations organized by \r\nterrorist groups that are armed, financed and supported \r\nfrom outside. Outside support for armed groups, and \r\ntheir key role in the Syrian crisis, has thus been proved: \r\nit is clear and no longer requires discussion. \r\nThe Syrian Government has proposed every \r\npossible type of cooperation in order to reach a solution \r\nto the Syrian crisis on the political and humanitarian \r\nfronts. We regret, however, that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil makes no positive mention of the enormous \r\nefforts of the Syrian Government. Nor does the report \r\nmention the presence of armed terrorist groups in Syria. \r\nThe Council does not take into consideration the Syrian \r\nGovernment’s obligations under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international humanitarian law to \r\noppose such groups and all those who support them. On \r\nthe contrary, we see intense efforts on the part of some \r\nStates members of the Council — directly responsible \r\nfor the deterioration of the political and humanitarian \r\nsituation and for bloodshed — to repeatedly adopt \r\nunilateral political resolutions on Syria aimed at \r\npushing the Government to give up its sovereign rights.\r\nWe have not seen the Human Rights Council \r\ncondemn or reject the two-year boycott of its work by \r\nthe occupying Power of Israel. We therefore wonder \r\nif Council members’ reaction would be so lukewarm \r\nif other States besides Israel boycotted it. Can the \r\nCouncil tell us about the measures it has taken to hold \r\nIsrael responsible for its refusal to cooperate with the \r\ndozens of resolutions and the fact-finding commissions \r\nof inquiry on the numerous crimes it has perpetrated \r\nover the decades in the occupied Arab territories? Has \r\nit made even modest efforts to implement resolutions \r\non human rights in the occupied Syrian Golan? No, \r\nthat has not happened. Apparently, the Council does \r\nnot consider the humanitarian situation in the Golan \r\na priority. Why? Because that tragic and dangerous \r\nsituation involves Israel, the occupying Power.\r\nThe politicized resolutions of the Council have \r\nharmed, and will harm, the efforts that went into its \r\ncreation and establishment as a body capable of dealing \r\nwith all violations of human rights at the international \r\nlevel with clear criteria applicable to all and without \r\n26/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nfor Human Rights, more coordinated actions, and the \r\nimprovement of institutional relations between the \r\nOffice and the Council.\r\nWith regard to supporting the further mainstreaming \r\nof human rights issues into a broad range of activities \r\nand further strengthening cooperation in the field of \r\nhuman rights within the United Nations system, my \r\ndelegation emphasizes the need to avoid duplication in \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council and the Third \r\nCommittee.\r\nUkraine is committed to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights worldwide. In that regard, \r\nwe have presented our candidature for membership in \r\nthe Human Rights Council for the period 2018 to 2020. \r\nMy country remains determined to engage in the work \r\nof the Council in a constructive manner. As a member \r\nof the Council, Ukraine would exert every effort to \r\nensure that the Council fulfilled its mandate in the most \r\neffective and comprehensive manner.\r\nMr. Elbahi (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nmy delegation associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Gabon on behalf of the African \r\nGroup. \r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to extend our \r\nthanks to the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor introducing the report of the Council (A/68/53) \r\nand for his complementary briefing to the Assembly. \r\nWe wish him every success in carrying out his tasks. \r\nBy the same token, we would like to congratulate the \r\nrecently elected new members of the Council. We hope \r\nthat their terms of office will provide further impetus \r\nto the work of the Council and its mechanisms. \r\nThe establishment of the Human Rights Council, \r\nseven years ago, was an important achievement \r\nfor the General Assembly and its various bodies in \r\naddressing human rights issues on the basis of the \r\nequality of all Member States, and as reflected in \r\nthe universal periodic review, to which all Members \r\nwithout exception are subject. The Council also \r\nprovides advice, in accordance with its mandate set out \r\nin resolution 60/251, through the special procedures \r\nsystem. That is an important service, provided that \r\nmandate holders adhere to the principles of impartiality \r\nand non-politicization and avoid selectivity, in line with \r\nthe spirit and letter of the mandates and the Code of \r\nConduct for Special Procedures Mandate-Holders of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, adopted by the Council in \r\nterrorism. The article also says that hundreds of \r\nmillions of dollars have been shipped just by this guy in \r\nKuwait to Salafist and Takfiri groups in Syria. I think \r\nthat is the best reply to my colleague from Kuwait.\r\nMr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): Ukraine is strongly \r\ncommitted to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights and pays special attention to United Nations \r\nactivities in that area, in particular within the framework \r\nof the Human Rights Council. We positively assess the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council during the reporting \r\nperiod reflected in the Council report (A/68/53) that \r\ncovers its twenty-second, twenty-third and twenty-\r\nfourth regular sessions.\r\nWith its systemic thematic approaches and urgent \r\nresponses to pressing human rights situations, the \r\nCouncil has demonstrated its ability to act as a key \r\nUnited Nations body responsible for the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights worldwide. The report \r\nprovides clear evidence of the Council’s competence \r\nand credibility in addressing urgent country-specific \r\nsituations. At the same time, Ukraine believes that \r\ngenuine and effective prevention is a pragmatic \r\nalternative to averting human rights violations.\r\nSeeking to strengthen the international community’s \r\nability to effectively prevent human rights violations, \r\nUkraine consistently proceeds with the realization of \r\nits initiative — the Human Rights Council resolution on \r\nthe role of prevention in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights, which is traditionally adopted by \r\nconsensus.\r\nWe consider the special procedures of the Council \r\nand the universal periodic review (UPR) mechanism as \r\nextremely important tools for the protection of human \r\nrights, which can improve the situation of human rights \r\nglobally. Ukraine has issued a standing invitation to all \r\nthematic special procedures and received a number of \r\nvisits upon their request. We would like to encourage \r\ncountries to closely cooperate with the special \r\nprocedures of the Council, in particular by honouring \r\nthe standing invitations issued. We are also strongly \r\ncommitted to the universal periodic review mechanism. \r\nUkraine presented its national report for the second \r\ncycle of the review to the Working Group on the UPR \r\nin a timely manner and was successfully reviewed in \r\nOctober 2012, with the further adoption of the UPR \r\noutcome by the twenty-second session of the Council.\r\nWe commend the closer Council cooperation with \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\n13-56114 27/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nEnvoy for the Sudan and South Sudan. Furthermore, \r\nthe Government has established an office to protect \r\nwomen and children from violence. We also established \r\neconomic projects for women, particularly in rural \r\nareas.\r\nAs for the elderly, my Government has established \r\ncentres to take care of them. In addition to strengthening \r\nthe family relations ingrained in our society, the elderly \r\nare given preference when receiving care and we \r\ncherish and honour them.\r\nWith regard to institutional frameworks, the Sudan’s \r\nadvisory council on human rights plays a pivotal role \r\nin following up on international commitments and \r\nnational obligations and plans related to human rights. \r\nWe would also like to state that the independent human \r\nrights commission established in accordance with the \r\nParis Principles has been successfully functioning for \r\ntwo years. That is in addition to other mechanisms that \r\nwe do not have time to discuss at this meeting.\r\nAt the bilateral level, my Government has signed \r\nagreements to secure its borders with neighbouring \r\nStates in order to prevent human rights abuses, \r\nparticularly breaches related to human trafficking and \r\nother relevant violations. Accordingly, my Government \r\nhas signed bilateral treaties with neighbouring Chad, \r\nLibya, the Central African Republic and South Sudan. \r\nIn that connection, I would like to state that the Sudan \r\nrecently adopted a national law that prevents trafficking \r\nin humans and in human organs.\r\nAt the national level in general, my country has \r\ncontributed to the stability of the situation in Darfur, \r\nBlue Nile and Southern Kordofan, and violence \r\nhas significantly decreased. That paves the way for \r\nfostering human rights in those areas.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation calls for sufficient \r\nfunds to be made available to enable the Council and \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights to thoroughly fulfil their responsibilities \r\nand obligations and to promote internationally agreed \r\nhuman rights with a view to treating all human rights \r\nequally, without favouring some at the expense of \r\nothers, and without involving new concepts that have \r\nnot been internationally agreed to, Member State \r\nmust be adequately consulted with regard to any new \r\nmechanism or programme to be undertaken by the \r\nCouncil or the High Commissioner.\r\nWe also call for the adoption of a comprehensive \r\napproach to fostering and protecting human rights that \r\nits resolution 5/2 and re-emphasized in its resolution \r\n11/11, of June 2009.\r\nMy delegation would like to underscore the Sudan’s \r\ncontinued cooperation with the Human Rights Council \r\nwith a view to promoting and fostering human rights in \r\nmy country. In that connection, we would like to point \r\nout that the Sudan submitted its report to the universal \r\nperiodic review, accepted its recommendations and \r\nestablished a national commission to implement them. \r\nIt is now ready to participate in the second review cycle \r\nin the same spirit in which we have been cooperating \r\nwith the Independent Expert on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Sudan. \r\nAs a demonstration of my Government’s \r\ncommitment to comprehensively promoting human \r\nrights, the Sudan has prepared its tenth national plan \r\nof action to promote and strengthen human rights, \r\nwhich is a broad framework aimed at achieving that \r\nimportant goal. It integrates a wide-ranging vision of \r\nall the relevant aspects in that important field. That \r\naccomplishment is in addition to numerous endeavours \r\nundertaken by my Government to help all of its citizens \r\nenjoy their rights without discrimination. \r\nWith regard to promoting the rights of the child, we \r\nhave, among other things, acceded to the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child and its two Optional \r\nProtocols — on the involvement of children in armed \r\nconflict and on the sale of children, child prostitution \r\nand child pornography. The Sudan has ratified \r\nConventions No. 182 and No. 138 of the International \r\nLabour Organization and has used provisions of \r\nthose international instruments to draw up national \r\nlegislation, including the 2010 law on the protection \r\nof children. We have also established a comprehensive \r\nsupplementary law to protect minors, which has been in \r\neffect for two years. In addition, the laws related to the \r\narmed forces, the security sector and the police contain \r\nprovisions that categorically prevent the conscription or \r\nrecruitment of children in their ranks.\r\nTo protect and defend the rights of people with \r\ndisabilities, we have signed and ratified the Convention \r\non the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Based on its \r\nprovisions, in 2009 we enacted a national disability act \r\nand have established a national council for the disabled.\r\nWith regard to protecting the rights of women, \r\nmy country has put in place a comprehensive 25-year \r\nstrategy for the advancement of women. We are also \r\ncooperating in the field with the Office of the Special \r\n28/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nThe current financial and economic crises will \r\nno doubt have a negative effect on the work of the \r\nCouncil, particularly with respect to the numerous \r\nrecommendations in decisions and resolutions, which \r\nneed to be implemented in an equal manner. In that \r\ncontext, South Africa remains convinced that the \r\nuniversal periodic review (UPR) is the pillar for the \r\nwork of the Council in the fulfilment of States’ human \r\nrights obligations and the improvement of the situation \r\non the ground in every country.\r\nIn realizing that objective, the Voluntary Fund \r\nfor Financial and Technical Assistance for the \r\nimplementation of the UPR must be properly resourced \r\nfor the purposes of assisting States to develop their \r\nnational capacities and expertise for the implementation \r\nof the Council’s recommendations. \r\nSimilarly, we attach great importance to the work \r\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights generally and in the context of \r\nresolution 48/141, which established the Office in the \r\nfirst place and directed it to work under the direction \r\nof the Secretary-General, within the framework of \r\nthe overall competence, authority and decisions of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and the erstwhile Commission on Human \r\nRights, whose mandate now devolves on the Human \r\nRights Council. It is imperative to emphasize that the \r\nresolution outlines the mandate of the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner as the promotion and protection \r\nof all universally recognized human rights — as well \r\nas, more importantly, one issue that is usually forgotten \r\nby the United Nations human rights system in Geneva, \r\nnamely, the realization of the right to development. \r\nAgain, we cannot overemphasize that point.\r\nWe therefore call for a more visible allocation \r\nof resources and other support to enable the Office \r\nto carry out its mandate. It is also our view that, in \r\naddressing key economic, social and cultural rights \r\nissues, the Office of the High Commissioner should \r\nalign itself with the overall, overarching vision for the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Developments Goals \r\n(MDGs). South Africa is of the view that the current \r\npost-2015 development agenda should not deflect our \r\nattention from achieving the MDGs.\r\nWe are encouraged by the Council’s work in the \r\narea of the practical enjoyment of economic, social \r\nand cultural rights, which remain key to eradicating \r\nextreme poverty, inequality and underdevelopment \r\nworldwide. We are of the view that more can still be \r\nconsiders exempting developing countries from punitive \r\nmeasures for violations and lifting the sanctions on \r\nsome of them and removing restrictions on their \r\nexports — an approach that takes into consideration \r\nclimate change and the major reasons that stand in the \r\nway of the efforts of Governments, particularly the \r\nGovernments of developing countries, to fulfil their \r\nobligations towards this important issue.\r\nMr. Montwedi (South Africa): My delegation \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered on behalf \r\nof the African Group on the subject of the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council (A/68/53).\r\nSouth Africa welcomes this opportunity for a \r\ndialogue with the President of the Human Rights Council \r\non the annual report of the Council and its activities \r\nduring its seventh cycle year. We also appreciate the \r\nvision and leadership role played by the presidency in \r\ncarrying out the mandate of supporting the work of the \r\nCouncil.\r\nSouth Africa supports the Council’s mandate \r\nas a principal United Nations body responsible for \r\nuniversal respect for and the protection of all human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms for all. That should \r\nbe without distinction of any kind and must be carried \r\nout in a fair and equal manner, as enshrined in the \r\nfounding resolution 60/251. We wish to recall that \r\nthe Council was established as a subsidiary body of \r\nthe General Assembly and body of first instance in \r\naddressing all human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nthrough cooperation and genuine dialogue, free from \r\npoliticization, selectivity and double standards. It is \r\nthat resolve that impels the Council to give balanced \r\nattention to economic, social, cultural, civil and \r\npolitical rights, as well as to the realization of the right \r\nto development. The decisions and resolutions of the \r\nCouncil are important and should be given time to run \r\ntheir course, without the same texts being duplicated in \r\nthe Third Committee even before they are implemented.\r\nWe therefore remain convinced that the spirit and \r\nvision embodied in the Proclamation of Tehran, adopted \r\nduring the International Conference on Human Rights \r\nin 1968, that the full realization of civil and political \r\nrights without the enjoyment of economic, social and \r\ncultural rights is actually impossible and hollow. The \r\nachievement of lasting progress in the implementation \r\nof human rights is dependent upon sound and effective \r\nnational and international policies of economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\n13-56114 29/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\nconsulted on by the full membership of the United \r\nNations through the General Assembly, in line with \r\nparagraph 5 of resolution 60/251.\r\nFinally, we share other delegations’ concerns about \r\nwith the manner in which issues are raised in Council \r\nresolution 24/24, adopted during its twenty-fourth \r\nsession in September, entitled “Cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, its representatives and mechanisms \r\nin the field of human rights”, particularly regarding \r\nthe designation of a United Nations-wide senior focal \r\npoint to promote the prevention of, protection against \r\nand accountability for reprisals and intimidation. \r\nIt is our firm belief that that matter requires further \r\nreflection and deliberation by the General Assembly, \r\nincluding a determination of the way forward. South \r\nAfrica is strongly opposed to any act of intimidation \r\nor reprisals against any individual or group, and we \r\nbelieve that domestic jurisprudence should be used to \r\ndeal adequately with matters of that nature.\r\nWe wish to assure the President and the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council of our support and \r\ncooperation in leading the Council on its path to \r\nfulfilling its mandate, which remains our vision going \r\nforward.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): I would like at the outset \r\nto express our gratitude to Ambassador Henczel, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, for introducing \r\nthe Council’s report today (A/68/53).\r\nEgypt aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Gabon on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, and would like to make the following remarks \r\nin its national capacity.\r\nThe annual report of the Human Rights Council on \r\nits regular and special sessions reflects the Council’s \r\nefforts to build national capacities and promote \r\neconomic, social, cultural, civil and political rights \r\non an equal footing. We commend its significant role \r\nin promoting all human rights through the universal \r\nperiodic review process, which remains the only \r\nrelevant mechanism for addressing human-rights \r\nsituations in a comprehensive and balanced manner. We \r\nalso commend the Council on its work in promoting the \r\nprotection of human rights in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem and the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan, as well as in combating racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia, intolerance, negative \r\nstereotyping and stigmatization based on religion or \r\nbelief. \r\ndone in that area. South Africa appreciates the work \r\ncurrently being undertaken relating to the roles and \r\nresponsibilities of transnational corporations and other \r\nbusiness enterprises with respect to human rights. We \r\nlook forward to a more systematic and focused approach \r\nto dealing with the human rights violations that are \r\noften caused by such entities. It should be pointed out \r\nthat they still remain unaccountable in international \r\nhuman rights law.\r\nIt is our firm belief that the application of the \r\nprinciple of non-discrimination remains a cornerstone \r\nof the practical enjoyment of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms in the Council’s work. Its \r\nefforts on racial discrimination should be further \r\nreinforced and strengthened. It is particularly critical \r\nthat programmes, decisions and resolutions in the area \r\nbe fully implemented and funding provided for them as \r\nwell. My delegation remains seriously concerned about \r\nthe proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-\r\n2015 contained in document A/68/6, which reduced \r\nfunding for the follow-up and implementation of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action and the \r\nfellowship programmes associated with that process. \r\nWe wish to reiterate the call for a more equitable \r\nallocation of funding to implement the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action as part of \r\nthe global effort to eradicate the scourges of racism \r\neverywhere. South Africa attaches great importance \r\nto decisions and resolutions in the area of racial \r\ndiscrimination, and we remain concerned about the lack \r\nof progress in ensuring that the independent eminent \r\nexperts’ group previously appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is sufficiently supported to enable it to carry \r\nout its mandate to follow up on the implementation of \r\nthe Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nSouth Africa welcomes the Council’s attention \r\nto the situation of human rights in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories and wishes to emphasize that the \r\nPalestinians’ practical enjoyment of all human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms hinges on the realization of \r\ntheir right to self-determination.\r\nThe recent attempts to erode the institution-building \r\ntext of the Human Rights Council have highlighted \r\nserious governance gaps in the work and authority \r\nof the Council. The Council’s credibility depends \r\non that critical institutional foundation. It is equally \r\nincumbent on the Council to always promote dialogue \r\nand cooperation in carrying out its mandate. Matters \r\nwith serious political ramifications should always be \r\n30/31 13-56114\r\nA/68/PV.52 13/11/2013\r\nfor the second and that delegations must speak from \r\ntheir seats. \r\nMr. Al-Hamadi (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\ntaken the f loor to reply to the claims and accusations \r\nmade by the Syrian regime’s representative against my \r\ncountry. The representative of that regime continues to \r\ndistort realities and facts, trying to depict the revolution \r\nof the free people of Syria, who are calling for their \r\nrightful, legitimate rights, as if it were terrorism \r\nsupported from abroad, despite the resolutions and \r\nreports that condemn the acts of that regime. However, \r\nthrough this international body, we reaffirm that the \r\nState of Qatar will continue to act so as to enable the \r\nvoice of the brotherly Syrian people to reach this body \r\nas they call for the realization of their legitimate rights.\r\nMs. Alsaleh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): We apologize for asking for the f loor again \r\nunder this agenda item, but we would like to reply to \r\nthe accusations made by the State of Qatar just now. \r\nThe repetitive statements by representatives of Qatar, \r\ntrying in vain to persuade the international community \r\nthat what is happening in Syria is the responsibility of \r\nthe Syrian Government, is an insult to the intelligence \r\nof those who are present here. It is a revolting joke \r\nand insult. We advise the representative of Qatar to \r\nread the media reports of international organizations, \r\nhighlighting the role of Qatar in funding the terrorism \r\nof Al Qaida in my country. \r\nThe Syrian people send a message to Qatar. It goes \r\nas follows: Stop lying! The Syrian people will hold the \r\nregime of Qatar accountable for all its crimes against \r\nthe Syrian people very soon.  In Doha, there are those \r\nwho should pay for the blood shed by Syrian citizens. A \r\nchange in the leadership of the Qatari Government does \r\nnot mean that those who sponsor Wahabi fundamentalist \r\nterrorism in my country will stop.\r\nMr. Al-Hamadi (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): As I \r\nmentioned in my first intervention, it was not merely \r\nan accusation, it was in reference to General Assembly \r\nresolutions, particularly resolutions 67/262 and 66/253, \r\nand reports by the Human Rights Council and the \r\ndecisions taken by the Human Rights Council, as well \r\nas the resolutions and presidential statements of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMs. Al-saleh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): We apologize yet again for taking the f loor. We \r\nare saddened that the representative of Qatar mentions \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Human \r\nThe Human Rights Council has a crucial role to play \r\nin supporting Member States in their efforts to promote \r\nand protect human rights. In order to succeed, it should \r\nfully respect the principle of sovereignty and uphold \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIt should act with even-handedness, impartiality and \r\nnon-selectivity by avoiding the following predicaments: \r\nfirst, politicizing the Human Rights Council’s work \r\nto serve political objectives that are not related to \r\nthe protection of all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms; secondly, injecting controversial notions \r\nsuch as sexual orientation and gender identity in an \r\nattempt to legitimize such notions, which have no legal \r\nfoundation under national humanitarian and human \r\nrights law; and thirdly, using the Council as a tool \r\nto legitimize interference in the domestic affairs of \r\nMember States, contrary to the Charter of the United \r\nNations. \r\nThe Human Rights Council should not become \r\na tool for any groups or Member States who claim \r\nmoral superiority over other members and designate \r\nthemselves guardians of universal values that they \r\nthemselves have defined, disregarding the diversity \r\nof social, cultural, legal and religious values of other \r\nMember States, which will eventually undermine the \r\nuniversality of the cause of human rights. \r\nThe international community has a responsibility \r\nto strenghthen the role of the Human Rights Council by \r\nensuring the full and timely cooperation of all Member \r\nStates with international fact-finding missions and \r\nmissions of enquiry created by Council resolutions and \r\nto ensure the implementation of the recommendations \r\nof those missions. It should also ensure that mandate \r\nholders fully respect their mandates and their codes of \r\nconduct.\r\nFinally, Egypt reaffirms its commitment to support \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council in respecting \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms by \r\npromoting the implementation of the recommendations \r\nof the universal periodic review by all States, without \r\ndistinction, and by encouraging the engagement of all \r\nStates with mandate holders. \r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 64. \r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. I would like to \r\nremind members that rights of reply should be limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first intervention and five minutes \r\n13-56114 31/31\r\n13/11/2013 A/68/PV.52\r\ninternal affairs of Syria, and we promise him that the \r\nSyrian people will hold Qatar accountable very soon. \r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of the consideration of agenda item 64.\r\nThe  meeting rose at 1.20 p.m. \r\nRights Council, although those resolutions were not \r\nadopted by consensus. Those resolutions were promoted \r\nby his country and other countries with very notorious \r\npolitical agendas against my country. We therefore \r\nadvise the representative of Qatar not to interfere in the \r\n"
