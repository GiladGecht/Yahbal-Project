Italy was elected for \r\na term of office beginning on 1 January 2014 and \r\nending on 31 December 2015.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate Germany, \r\nGreece, Italy and Portugal on having been elected \r\nmembers of the Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 114.\r\nAgenda item 129\r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of \r\nPersons Responsible for Serious Violations of \r\nInternational Humanitarian Law Committed in  \r\nthe Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991\r\nLetter from the President of the Security Council \r\n(A/68/516)\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/68/539, A/68/539/Add.1 and A/68/539/Add.2) \r\nCurricula vitae (A/68/540)\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will \r\nproceed to the election of one permanent judge of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons \r\nResponsible for Serious Violations of International \r\nHumanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia since 1991 for a four-year term of \r\noffice commencing on the date of election.\r\nIn connection with the election today of the one \r\npermanent judge, I should like to bring the following \r\nmatters to the attention of the General Assembly.\r\nI should like to inform members that, as of 1 January \r\n2014, the following States from among the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States will be represented \r\non the Economic and Social Council: Austria, Canada, \r\nDenmark, France, New Zealand, San Marino, Sweden, \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland and the United States of America. The names \r\nof those nine States should therefore not appear on the \r\nballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s name plate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.\r\nI should like to remind members that, at this stage, \r\nthey are voting in the by-election for four seats for the \r\nWestern European and other States.\r\nBallot papers will now be distributed. I request \r\nrepresentatives to use only those ballot papers and \r\nto write on them the names of the States for which \r\nthey wish to vote. A ballot will be declared invalid \r\nif it contains more names of Member States from the \r\nrelevant region than the number of seats assigned to it. \r\nA ballot will also be declared invalid if all the names \r\nof the Member States on that ballot do not belong to the \r\nrelevant region.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Mr. Louis \r\n(Colombia), Ms. Del Águila Castillo (Guatemala), \r\nMs. Jónsdóttir (Iceland), Mr. Ivezaj (Montenegro), \r\nMr. Stefanik (Poland), Ms. Bartolini (San Marino), \r\nMs. AlSweel (Saudi Arabia) and Mr. Madut (South \r\nSudan) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.20 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 10.55 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nGroup B — Western European and Other States \r\n(1 seat)\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 187\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\n13-56715 3/5\r\n18/11/2013 A/68/PV.53\r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights \r\nlaw.”\r\nAs members are aware, the election of judges will \r\ntake place in accordance with the relevant provisions of \r\narticle 13 bis of the statute of the International Tribunal.\r\nAlso, given the similar nature of the election of \r\njudges of the International Court of Justice and the \r\nelection of judges of the International Tribunal, it was \r\ndecided at the time of the elections of judges in 1993 as \r\nwell as in 1997, 1998, 2001 and 2005 to follow similar \r\nelection procedures in the General Assembly.\r\nIn the light of the remarks just made, may I take it \r\nthat the Assembly agrees with the suggestion to follow \r\nsimilar election procedures in the General Assembly \r\nelection of judges of the International Court of Justice \r\nand the election of judges of the International Tribunal, \r\nin line with the procedures followed at the time of the \r\nelections of judges in 1993 as well as in 1997, 1998, \r\n2001 and 2005?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with article \r\n13 bis, sub-paragraph 1 (d), of the statute of the \r\nInternational Tribunal, the candidate who receives \r\nan absolute majority of the votes of States Members \r\nof the United Nations and of the non-member States \r\nmaintaining permanent observer missions at United \r\nNations Headquarters shall be declared elected.\r\nThe consistent practice of the United Nations \r\nhas been to interpret the words “absolute majority” \r\nas meaning a majority of all electors, whether or not \r\nthey vote or are allowed to vote. The electors, for this \r\npurpose, are all the Member States, totalling 193, and \r\ntwo non-member States, namely, the Holy See and the \r\nState of Palestine. Accordingly, 98 votes constitute \r\nan absolute majority for the purpose of electing a \r\npermanent judge of the International Tribunal.\r\nIf, in the first ballot, none of the candidates obtains \r\nan absolute majority, a second ballot will be held and \r\nballoting will continue in the same meeting until a \r\ncandidate has obtained an absolute majority.\r\nFollowing the practice in the election of judges \r\nof the International Court of Justice, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral suggests in his memorandum that any second \r\nand subsequent balloting shall be unrestricted.\r\nIt is further suggested that, following the practice \r\nin the election of the judges of the International Court of \r\nFirst, according to article 13 bis, paragraph 1, of \r\nthe statute of the International Tribunal as amended by \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 1166 (1998), of 13 May \r\n1998, and 1329 (2000), of 30 November 2000, the one \r\npermanent judge of the International Tribunal shall \r\nbe elected by the General Assembly from a list of \r\ncandidates submitted by the Security Council.\r\nIn accordance with article 13 bis, sub-paragraph 1 \r\n(c), of the statute of the International Tribunal, a list \r\nof six candidates, taking due account of the adequate \r\nrepresentation of the principal legal systems of the \r\nworld, was formally conveyed to the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly by a letter dated 3 October 2013 \r\nfrom the President of the Security Council (A/68/516).\r\nSecondly, in accordance with article 13 bis, \r\nsub-paragraph 1 (d), of the statute of the International \r\nTribunal, the Holy See and the State of Palestine, \r\nnon-member States maintaining permanent observer \r\nmissions at United Nations Headquarters, shall \r\nparticipate in the election in the same manner as the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. On this occasion, \r\nI am happy to welcome here the observers of the Holy \r\nSee and the State of Palestine.\r\nFinally, I should like to draw the attention of the \r\nAssembly to the documents relating to the election. The \r\nmemorandum by the Secretary-General concerning \r\nthe election of judges of the International Tribunal is \r\ncontained in documents A/68/539 and addenda 1 and \r\n2. The list of candidates can be found in paragraph 8 of \r\ndocument A/68/539. As indicated in the addenda to that \r\ndocument, Austria, the Islamic Republic of Iran and \r\nJordan have decided to withdraw their candidatures for \r\njudge of the International Tribunal. Therefore, there are \r\nonly three candidates for this election.\r\nThe curricula vitae of the three candidates are \r\ncontained in document A/68/540. In that connection, \r\nmay I bring to the attention of the Assembly the \r\nprovision of article 13 of the statute of the International \r\nTribunal, which reads as follows:\r\n“The permanent and ad litem judges shall be \r\npersons of high moral character, impartiality and \r\nintegrity who possess the qualifications required \r\nin their respective countries for appointment to the \r\nhighest judicial offices.\r\n“In the overall composition of the Chambers \r\nand sections of the Trial Chambers, due account \r\nshall be taken of the experience of the judges \r\nin criminal law, international law, including \r\n4/5 13-56715\r\nA/68/PV.53 18/11/2013\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Mr. Louis \r\n(Colombia), Ms. Del Águila Castillo (Guatemala), \r\nMs. Jónsdóttir (Iceland), Mr. Ivezaj (Montenegro), \r\nMr. Stefanik (Poland), Ms. Bartolini (San Marino), \r\nMs. AlSweel (Saudi Arabia) and Mr. Madut (South \r\nSudan) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.15 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.35 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 193\r\nAbstentions: 4\r\nNumber of members voting: 189\r\nRequired absolute majority: 98\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Koffi Afande (Togo) 94\r\nMs. Gabrielle McIntyre (Australia) 53\r\nMr. Pavel Gontšarov (Estonia) 42\r\nThe Acting President: Since no candidate has \r\nobtained an absolute majority of votes, the Assembly \r\nwill have to proceed to a second unrestricted ballot \r\nto fill the remaining vacancy. In accordance with the \r\ndecision taken earlier, that ballot shall be unrestricted.\r\nI request representatives to use only those \r\nballot papers that have been distributed. Only those \r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers are \r\neligible for election. Representatives will indicate the \r\none candidate for whom they wish to vote by placing a \r\ncross at the left of the name on the ballot papers. Ballot \r\npapers on which more than one name is marked will be \r\nconsidered invalid. Votes may be cast only for those \r\nwhose names appear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Mr. Louis \r\n(Colombia), Ms. Del Águila Castillo (Guatemala), \r\nMs. Jónsdóttir (Iceland), Mr. Ivezaj (Montenegro), \r\nMr. Stefanik (Poland), Ms. Bartolini (San Marino), \r\nMs. AlSweel (Saudi Arabia) and Mr. Madut (South \r\nSudan) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.55 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 12.15 p.m.\r\nJustice, if more than one candidate obtains an absolute \r\nmajority of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot will \r\nbe held on all candidates and balloting will continue at \r\nthe same meeting until one candidate, and no more, has \r\nobtained an absolute majority.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly agrees to the \r\nprocedures I have just outlined?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nObserver of the Observer State of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Chullikatt (Holy See): My delegation \r\nfollows the work of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) with great attention \r\nand welcomes efforts being undertaken to conclude the \r\nwork of the ad hoc Tribunal.\r\nWhile the Holy See is entitled to participate in \r\nthe election of judges to the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals, in accordance with \r\nits prior practice during the elections to the ICTY and \r\nin consideration of its specific nature and objectives, \r\nmy delegation elects to abstain from casting its vote \r\non individual candidates. In so doing, my delegation \r\nexpresses its best wishes to the candidates and renews \r\nits vivid hope that the candidate who will be elected \r\nwill serve justice and contribute to peace around the \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: Before we begin the voting \r\nprocess, I should like to remind members that, pursuant \r\nto rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly, no representative shall interrupt the voting \r\nexcept on a point of order on the actual conduct of the \r\nvoting. In addition, ballot papers will be given only to \r\nthe representative seated directly behind the country’s \r\nname plate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot papers \r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use \r\nonly those ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\nOnly those candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot papers are eligible for election. Representatives \r\nwill indicate the one candidate for whom they wish to \r\nvote by placing a cross at the left of the name on the \r\nballot papers. Ballot papers on which more than one \r\nname is marked will be considered invalid. Votes may \r\nbe cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot \r\npapers.\r\n13-56715 5/5\r\n18/11/2013 A/68/PV.53\r\nwith them, cannot wait for that moment, which we hope \r\nwill occur very soon.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Israel.\r\nMr. Roet (Israel): Israel congratulates Judge Afande \r\nand welcomes his election. I apologize for being \r\nforced to ruin what should have been a celebratory \r\nand professional vote. Unfortunately, that is not yet the \r\ncase. Again, we see the representative of the Palestinian \r\nAuthority trying to hijack precious time. I have no issue \r\nwith the Palestinian Authority celebrating what it deems \r\na historic vote. That should have been done outside the \r\nHall. I regret that. What forces me to speak is the fact \r\nthat Israel maintains its position that the Palestinian \r\nAuthority is not a State and that it clearly fails to meet \r\nthe criteria for statehood.\r\nI wish to stress that the manner in which that \r\ndelegation has participated in the proceedings today \r\nhas no effect on its status and does not confer statehood. \r\nThere is only one route to Palestinian statehood. That \r\nroute does not run through the meeting rooms in \r\nNew York, but through direct negotiations between \r\nJerusalem and Ramallah, which, hopefully, we pray, \r\nwill lead to a secure and lasting peace between Israelis \r\nand Palestinians.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 129?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.20 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 0\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 192\r\nAbstentions: 3\r\nNumber of members voting: 189\r\nRequired absolute majority: 98\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Koffi Afande (Togo) 108\r\nMs. Gabrielle McIntyre (Australia) 56\r\nMr. Pavel Gontšarov (Estonia) 25\r\nThe Acting President: Having obtained an \r\nabsolute majority, Mr. Koffi Afande (Togo) is elected \r\na member of the International Tribunal for a four-year \r\nterm beginning on 18 November 2013.\r\nI take this opportunity to extend to the Judge the \r\ncongratulations of the Assembly on his election and to \r\nthank the tellers for their assistance.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Observer of the Observer \r\nState of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): I take the f loor to \r\nexpress, on behalf of the State of Palestine, the feeling \r\nof a proud people on this special occasion in our history \r\nat the General Assembly, in which the State of Palestine \r\nhas participated for the first time in this election. \r\nIt is an important step in our march for freedom and \r\nindependence and for full membership at the United \r\nNations. The reaction of almost all members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to our voting is a clear message that \r\nthe Assembly is ready for our membership. We, along \r\n"
