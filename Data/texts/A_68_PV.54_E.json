"In the absence of the President, Mrs. Miculescu \r\n(Romania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 14, 118 and 125 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/493)\r\nNote by the Secretariat (A/68/230)\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium Summit\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/120)\r\nUnited Nations reform: measures and proposals\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): With \r\nrespect to agenda items 14 and 118, members will recall \r\nthat the Assembly adopted resolution 68/6, entitled \r\n“Outcome document of the special event to follow-up \r\non efforts made towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals”, at its 32nd plenary meeting, on \r\n9 October.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nIndonesia.\r\nMr. Poernomo (Indonesia): I would like to express \r\nmy delegation’s gratitude to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive reports (A/68/493, A/68/230, \r\nA/68/120) pertaining to the agenda items under which \r\nwe are deliberating this morning. In line with the \r\nreports, Indonesia believes that States have the primary \r\nobligation to ensure the promotion of the rights to \r\nwater and sanitation by enacting relevant policies and \r\nlegislation that uphold gender equality, vulnerable \r\ngroups and anti-discrimination. In that regard, \r\nIndonesia supports the integration of that issue into \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda and looks forward \r\nto continuing efforts that ensure the promotion of the \r\nrights to water and sanitation at the global level.\r\nOn the issue of population and the development, \r\nwe note the importance of the follow-up to the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development beyond 2014. We \r\nwelcome the plan to convene a special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD)  during its \r\nsixty-ninth session. Indonesia is of the view that the \r\nissue of population is essential, as it affects the cost \r\nof national economic development. In that context, the \r\nassessment of the status of implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action during the forty-seventh session \r\nof the Commission on Population and Development, in \r\n2014, will be crucial to providing a solid foundation for \r\nthe success of the special session.\r\nOn the issues of promoting the participation of \r\nwomen in development, Indonesia is of the view that \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment is an \r\nessential component of development and needs to be \r\nintegrated into the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.54\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n54th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 20 November 2013, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As we approach \r\nthe post-MDG period, it is our fervent hope that the \r\nglobal development agenda beyond 2015 can also serve \r\nas an effective platform for focusing political will \r\nand momentum behind the global effort to eradicate \r\npoverty through sustainable growth with equity. The \r\ndevelopment agenda should leave no one behind by \r\nensuring equal opportunity and common prosperity for \r\nall.\r\nMr. Strickland (United States of America): on \r\nbehalf of the United States, I would like to express my \r\nGovernment’s thanks to the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the secretariat of the Programme of \r\nAction of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development beyond 2014 for presenting us with \r\nthis report on progress to date in the preparations for \r\nthe special session of the General Assembly on the \r\nfollow-up to the Programme of Action (A/68/493).\r\nThe Programme of Action, adopted by 179 \r\nGovernments at the 1994 Cairo International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) and reaffirmed \r\nin many intergovernmental negotiations since then, \r\nrecognizes that for all of us to realize our full potential \r\nand our reproductive rights, we must be able to exercise \r\nour right to attain the highest standard of sexual and \r\nreproductive health. The ICPD Programme of Action \r\ndiscusses the rights, policies, programmes and enabling \r\nconditions that all individuals, but particularly women \r\nand young people, need in order to successfully \r\nmanage for themselves issues related to their sexuality, \r\nreproduction and health.\r\nYet, 19 years after Cairo, those goals have not \r\nbeen fulfilled for many, especially those who are poor, \r\nyoung, female, disabled or displaced, and who are too \r\nfrequently marginalized, which includes members of \r\nracial, ethnic or sexual minorities. The ICPD agenda \r\nis also relevant to ongoing discussions regarding the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, and as such our work \r\nto review ICPD implementation to date will have \r\nresonance across the development framework of the \r\nWith regard to UN-Women’s strategic plan for \r\n2014-2017, Indonesia wishes to reiterate its expectation \r\nthat the plan will go beyond detailing output and \r\nachievement indicators for UN-Women. It should \r\nidentify UN-Women’s commitment to and provision \r\nfor responding to the various challenges that countries \r\nface, in line with their individual development priorities \r\nand needs.\r\nIndonesia supports continued efforts to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations develops into a more credible \r\nand accountable body. The General Assembly plays an \r\nimportant role in promoting global budget transparency \r\nby setting accountability standards throughout the \r\nUnited Nations system. Indonesia supports efforts to \r\nstrengthen the Organization’s ability to fully implement \r\nits mandate and ensure the effective implementation of \r\nall United Nations programmes. Reform efforts must \r\nreflect the unique character of the United Nations. In \r\nthat regard, efforts to promote greater accountability \r\nin the United Nations system, including through its \r\ninternal and external oversight bodies, should be \r\ncontinuously supported and enhanced by all relevant \r\nstakeholders.\r\nBudget transparency and accountability are \r\nincreasingly seen as an important precondition for \r\neffective governance. In addition to generating economic \r\nbenefits, they also function as a political expression \r\nof good governance. For sustaining such governance \r\nand rigorous budget accountability, we would like to \r\nemphasize the importance of making accurate data \r\nand information available in an efficient, cost-effective \r\nmanner through information technology. We are \r\npleased to say that Indonesia has established a national \r\nstrategy for integrating information technology system \r\noutputs, thus enabling them to be stored in a national \r\ndata center. Those data outputs can be accessed, linked \r\nto and matched online by our supreme audit institution. \r\nThat mechanism, known as an electronic audit, has \r\nsucceeded in systematically preventing and eradicating \r\ncorruption. It has made a significant contribution to our \r\nnational efforts to accomplish the Indonesian dream of \r\na zero-tolerant and corruption-free country.\r\nStrengthening supreme audit institutions is also \r\nessential to promoting good governance. Efficient, \r\naccountable, effective and transparent public \r\nadministration has a vital role to play in implementing \r\ninternationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In that \r\ncontext, we urge for full implementation of resolution \r\n13-57245 3/3\r\n20/11/2013 A/68/PV.54\r\nsexual violence against youth; and promote and protect \r\ntheir reproductive rights. New thinking and renewed \r\nvigour in our approach and partnerships can bring us \r\ncloser to attaining the ICPD goals for current and future \r\ngenerations of young people.\r\nIt is the United States priority that women and girls \r\neverywhere should achieve the freedom to decide for \r\nthemselves on matters of their own sexuality, so that \r\nthey may enjoy strong, healthy families and live in \r\nthriving communities and nations. We commend the \r\nefforts of the ICPD Programme of Action beyond 2014 \r\nsecretariat to report on progress to date in reviewing \r\nthe global implementation of the ICPD, and we are \r\ncommitted to working together with all Member States \r\nover the coming year to ensure a positive outcome to \r\nthe global review process.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 14, 118 and 125.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.25 a.m.\r\nUnited Nations. We must continue to move forward on \r\nmeeting the ICPD goals, and not lose momentum in the \r\nface of resistance or persistent challenges. One of those \r\nchallenges is reducing rates of mortality and morbidity \r\nrelated to sexual and reproductive health, particularly \r\nfor women and adolescent girls.\r\nIn addition, with more than 40 per cent of the \r\nworld’s population under the age of 25, we must \r\nincrease efforts to meet the needs of adolescents and \r\nyouth and secure their healthy transition to adulthood. \r\nWe must also help them avoid some of the pitfalls \r\nthat threaten to derail their futures, such as early and \r\nforced marriage, which is still all too prevalent in many \r\ncountries around the world. In particular, working in \r\npartnership with young people, we need to support and \r\nprovide quality education equally for girls and boys at \r\nleast through secondary school; make comprehensive \r\nsexual education available to all adolescents and youth; \r\nensure that health services, particularly sexual and \r\nreproductive health services, are accessible to young \r\npeople; work to prevent and respond to physical and \r\n"
