"The meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 36\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nReport of the Committee on the Exercise of  \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian  \r\nPeople (A/68/35)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/68/363)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/68/L.12, A/68/L.13, \r\nA/68/L.14 and A/68/L.15)\r\nThe President: As we begin consideration of this \r\nafternoon’s agenda item, let me reaffirm the undisputed \r\nconsensus concerning the creation of an independent \r\nPalestinian State living side by with the State of Israel, \r\nwithin secure and mutually recognized borders. This \r\nuniversally accepted solution was robustly reaffirmed \r\nrecently in resolution 67/19, which granted Palestine \r\nthe status of non-member observer State in the United \r\nNations.\r\nI take note of the considerable international \r\ndiplomatic activity that has been taking place in order \r\nto restart the stalled negotiations between the two sides. \r\nThere has been some forward movement on questions of \r\nsubstance, which I welcome. However, at the same time, \r\nthere have been steps taken that are distinctly unhelpful \r\nto, and even undermine, the chances of finding the kind \r\nof solution called for by our Assembly. At present, the \r\nprogression of the negotiations stands in jeopardy, and \r\nnone of the overwhelming number of supporters of \r\npeace and stability in the region wishes to contemplate \r\nthe possible consequences of such a situation.\r\nThe attention of the international community is \r\ncurrently being turned towards a new paradigm for \r\nimproving the quality of life of human beings beyond \r\n2015. At the heart of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nis a concern for people, regardless of race, religion or \r\neconomic status — a concern for “the dignity and worth \r\nof the human person”, in the words of our Charter.\r\nIt is extremely regrettable that at such a moment, \r\nthe people of Palestine find themselves locked in a \r\nhistoric battle for the very physical space that they \r\nhave long called their home. Such space is a necessary \r\ncondition to satisfy their basic aspirations today, to \r\nlive in security, freedom, honour and dignity. Human \r\ndignity cannot be compartmentalized. The desecration \r\nof humanity, whether in the West Bank or in Gaza or \r\nin Syria or elsewhere, is the desecration of humanity \r\neverywhere, and that should be of concern to all people.\r\nIn my address to the Assembly on 14 June (see \r\nA/67/PV.87), I informed Member States that my \r\npriority for the sixty-eighth session was “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. In those \r\nremarks, I signalled my intention to hold a number of \r\nthematic debates, including one on “ensuring stable \r\nand peaceful societies”. That activity is intended to \r\nfeed into the articulation of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, which is an agenda for all peoples, countries \r\nand regions, including the Middle East. That region, \r\nregrettably, seems to be one where the dream of \r\nachieving peace and stability faces its keenest \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.57\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n57th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 25 November 2013, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It was not until 29 November 2012 that \r\nthe General Assembly finally deigned to grant Palestine \r\nthe status of an observer State. Our Committee strongly \r\nsupported that decision, which we believed would help \r\nto revitalize the peace process. That view was borne out \r\nby events, which means that we are on the right track, \r\nas symbolically illustrated by the first vote of the State \r\nof Palestine in the General Assembly, last Monday, \r\n18 November (see A/68/PV.53). It is our fervent wish \r\nthat by next year we will be welcoming President \r\nMahmoud Abbas to the United Nations as leader of a \r\nsovereign and independent Member State.\r\nThe various parties, whose tenacious commitment \r\nmoved the peace process forward, deserve enormous \r\ncredit, including the United States of America, the \r\nLeague of Arab States, Jordan, the European Union, \r\nthe Quartet and the Secretary-General. However, there \r\nare worrying signs that the process is undergoing \r\na deep crisis of confidence, mainly as a result of the \r\nacceleration of illegal settlement activities, which \r\ncaused the Palestinian negotiating team to withdraw in \r\nprotest.\r\nIt is our view that the General Assembly, guarantor \r\nof international legitimacy, has an important role to play \r\nin the critical year ahead, with a view to maintaining \r\nthe integrity of the process. The four draft resolutions \r\nthat I would now like to introduce to the Assembly \r\nunder the present agenda item incorporate our thinking \r\nin that respect.\r\nDuring the past year, our Committee has redoubled \r\nits efforts to build on the momentum generated by \r\nresolution 67/19. We analysed all the implications of \r\nthe new political reality of the creation of a State under \r\noccupation, which, from our point of view, presents \r\nnew possibilities.\r\nThe first three draft resolutions are related to the \r\nwork of the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights of the Department of Political \r\nAffairs, and the special information programme on \r\nthe Question of Palestine of the Department of Public \r\nInformation. They reaffirm the important mandates \r\nentrusted to those entities by the General Assembly. As \r\nin the past, the Committee intends to make sure that the \r\nresources available to it are used in an optimal manner. \r\nThe draft resolutions have been subject to extensive \r\nchallenges, with causes that are both internal and \r\nexternal. In that regard, the political and social unrest \r\nthat has taken place in a number of countries during the \r\npast few years readily comes to mind.\r\nIt is for that reason that I welcome the limited-\r\nterm agreement recently announced by the P5+1 \r\nand Iran regarding the latter’s nuclear programme. \r\nThe negotiations that preceded the announcement \r\nof the agreement had begun with a dangerous rise \r\nin suspicions regarding the nature of Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme. I believe, and I hope, this weekend’s \r\nagreement represents a step in the direction of easing \r\nthose tensions and suspicions. Therefore, I trust that \r\nas we all look towards the future, memories of past \r\nwrongs, whether in word or deed, will not unduly \r\ninfluence perceptions of present intentions.\r\nI look forward to the timely and good-faith \r\nimplementation of the terms of that instrument, as a \r\ncontribution to strengthening peace and stability in \r\nthe Middle East. I expect that such implementation \r\nwill guide us on the path from confrontation to \r\ndialogue — dialogue that is aimed at strengthening \r\npeace, security and well-being within and among \r\npeoples. For it is through dialogue that we have a better \r\nunderstanding of each other’s fears and suspicions. It \r\nis through dialogue that we show signs that we are as \r\nmindful of the hurts of others as we are of our own. \r\nIt is through dialogue that we foster the spirit of \r\ntrust and confidence that alone can sustain and give \r\nstrength to our decisions. And it is through dialogue \r\nthat we will identify the pathways toward a just, lasting \r\nand mutually satisfactory agreement between the \r\nindependent States of Israel and Palestine, and towards \r\na stable and peaceful Middle East in general.\r\nI now give the f loor to His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Diallo of Senegal, in his capacity as \r\nChairman of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to introduce \r\ndraft resolutions A/68/L.12, A/68/L.13, A/68/L.14 and \r\nA/68/L.15.\r\nMr. Diallo (Senegal), Chairman of the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (spoke in French): At the outset, let me thank \r\nall the delegations, and you personally, Mr. President, \r\nfor your active participation in this morning’s special \r\nmeeting dedicated to the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People.\r\n13-57987 3/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\non all permanent-status issues within a nine-month \r\ntime frame. It also encourages all States and \r\nintergovernmental organizations to pursue policies that \r\nensure respect for their obligations under international \r\nlaw, in particular with regard to settlements.\r\nI hope that these provisions and all others in the \r\ndraft texts will meet the Assembly’s strong support. \r\nThe four draft resolutions that I have just introduced \r\noutline positions, mandates and programmes of special \r\nimportance, particularly at the present crucial juncture. \r\nOur Committee is fully committed to the cause of \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace. A vote in favour of the four \r\ndraft resolutions will certainly be a vote in favour of \r\npeace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Christopher Grima of Malta, Rapporteur \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, to introduce the report \r\nof the Committee.\r\nMr. Grima (Malta), Rapporteur of the Committee \r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People: It is an honour for me, in my capacity \r\nas Rapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, to present \r\nto the General Assembly the annual report of the \r\nCommittee, contained in document A/68/35. Allow me \r\nto summarize each section of the report.\r\nAfter the introduction of the report, chapters II \r\nand III outline the mandate entrusted to the Committee \r\nby the General Assembly and the organization of the \r\nCommittee’s work during the year. Under Chapter IV, \r\nthe report reviews the situation relating to the question \r\nof Palestine, as monitored by the Committee, and \r\ncontains a detailed factual account of the developments \r\nthat have taken place in the period under review, which \r\nended on 6 October 2013. The most recent events will \r\nbe reflected in the next report.\r\nChapter V describes the action taken by the \r\nCommittee, including the Chairman’s participation \r\nin General Assembly and Security Council debates, \r\nstatements issued by the Committee and its Bureau, \r\nand the continued dialogue between the Committee \r\nand members of intergovernmental organizations. \r\nThis chapter also reports on the various international \r\nmeetings and conferences organized by the Committee, \r\nas well as other mandated activities carried out by the \r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights.\r\nconsultation with regional groups and were approved \r\nby the Committee. They have been circulated as \r\ndocuments A/68/L.12, A/68/L.13 and A/68/L.14, which \r\nare now before members. There are some new elements \r\nwhich I will clarify.\r\nOver the years, the United Nations has declared \r\ninternational years dedicated to raising awareness \r\nabout a variety of issues of particular importance to \r\nthe international community. However, there has never \r\nbeen a year dedicated to the question of Palestine, \r\nwhich has been an item on the United Nations agenda \r\nfor a very long time, still unresolved despite years of \r\neffort. Our Committee wanted to correct that historical \r\nimbalance, which is why draft resolution A/68/L.12 \r\nproposes that the Assembly proclaim the year 2014 \r\nas the International Year of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People and that it request the Committee to \r\norganize activities in cooperation with Governments, \r\nrelevant organizations of the United Nations system, \r\nintergovernmental organizations and civil society.\r\nWe chose the year 2014 to focus the attention of the \r\ninternational community on the issue and afford it the \r\nopportunity to contribute to the peace process currently \r\nunder way. In the spirit of budgetary discipline, and \r\nfully aware of the financial constraints that the United \r\nNations is facing, it is important to note that we will \r\nnot being requesting additional resosurces from the \r\nregular budget. We will appeal to all supporters of \r\nthe Palestinian cause to contribute generously to the \r\ninitiative in the form of extrabudgetary funds.\r\nBear in mind that international years do not \r\nconcern just the United Nations. Governments, \r\nintergovernmental organizations and civil society \r\ntraditionally launch the bulk of activities relating to \r\ninternational years, including, for example, conferences, \r\nforums, youth camps, exhibitions, competitions, \r\nbriefings, rallies, petitions, concerts, film screenings, \r\nworkshops, festivals and so much more. We will be \r\ninviting members to share their ideas in the months \r\nahead in order to shape and coordinate this major \r\nundertaking. I encourage Member States to co-sponsor \r\nthe draft resolutions.\r\nThe fourth draft resolution, A/68/L.15, is entitled \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”. It \r\nreaffirms the position of the General Assembly with \r\nregard to the essential elements of such a settlement \r\nand includes references to the developments of the \r\npast year. It welcomes the resumption of negotiations \r\n4/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\ncommitments and to provide additional aid to avert \r\nfurther deterioration.\r\nThe Committee suggests that its programme of \r\ninternational meetings and conferences in 2014 be \r\nfocused on widening international support for the \r\nachievement of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople and the creation of a favourable atmosphere \r\nfor the success of the resumed permanent-status \r\nnegotiations.\r\nThe Committee will mobilize increased \r\ninternational scrutiny of the developments on the \r\nground, in particular settlement activities, and will \r\nemphasize responsibility and promote action by the \r\ninternational community to put an end to all illegal \r\nIsraeli policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem. The Committee \r\nwill also examine the legal ramifications of the new \r\ninternational status of the State of Palestine and will \r\ncontinue to call attention to the plight of the Palestinian \r\npolitical prisoners in Israeli jails and urge a resolution \r\nof their plight.\r\nThe Committee will continue to encourage \r\ncivil society partners to work with their national \r\nGovernments, parliamentarians and other institutions \r\nwith a view to gaining their full support for the work \r\nof the United Nations on the question of Palestine. It \r\nexpresses the hope that the reactivated working group \r\nwill help to build stronger partnerships with civil \r\nsociety. It also encourages its members and observers to \r\nmobilize their respective civil societies at the national \r\nlevel, in particular young people, and to establish \r\nsolidarity committees with the State of Palestine.\r\nThe Committee will reach out to all regional \r\ngroups at the United Nations with a view to expanding \r\nits membership. It will actively work to organize more \r\nthematic debates on the question of Palestine in various \r\nUnited Nations forums. The Committee calls upon the \r\nGeneral Assembly to proclaim an international year of \r\nsolidarity with the Palestinian people.\r\nThe Committee requests the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights of the Secretariat to continue its \r\nsubstantive and secretariat support, the programme \r\nof research, monitoring and publications and other \r\ninformational activities in support of the Committee’s \r\ncommunication strategy. The Committee encourages \r\nvoluntary contributions from members and observers \r\nin line with their capacity to put the programme on a \r\nsolid financial footing.\r\nChapter VI provides an overview of the work done \r\nover the year by the Department of Public Information \r\npursuant to resolution 67/22 of 30 November 2012.\r\nThe last chapter of the report contains the \r\nconclusions and recommendations of the Committee, \r\nin which the Committee reiterates its view that the \r\nadmission of Palestine as a non-member observer \r\nState by the General Assembly (see resolution 67/19) \r\nconstituted an important step towards the realization \r\nof the two-State solution. That gave a new urgency \r\nto the resumption of the peace process and vested the \r\nState of Palestine with important additional rights to \r\njoin international legal frameworks and to contribute to \r\nthe work of the United Nations system as a whole. The \r\nCommittee calls on all Member States to extend full \r\ndiplomatic recognition to the State of Palestine and on \r\nthe Security Council to revisit the issue of Palestine’s \r\nfull membership.\r\nWelcoming the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian \r\ndirect negotiations, the Committee calls for the \r\nsustained engagement and support of the international \r\ncommunity, including a revitalized Quartet, which is \r\nvital to ensure that the parties negotiate in good faith, \r\nlive up to their commitments and refrain from steps \r\nthat jeopardize negotiations. The current diplomatic \r\ninitiative may represent the final window of opportunity \r\nto achieve a negotiated two-State solution.  In that \r\nregard, the Committee expresses its concern about \r\nIsrael’s settlement activity, which threatens to derail \r\nnegotiations. The Committee welcomes the recently \r\nadopted European Union (EU) guidelines that prohibit \r\nfunding by EU institutions for Israeli entities connected \r\nwith the settlements as a first step towards fulfilling \r\nobligations under international law and calls for further \r\ninternational action against settlements.\r\nThe Committee condemns all attacks against \r\ncivilians and calls on the parties to adhere to the \r\nterms of the Gaza ceasefire agreement. It calls upon \r\nthe Security Council and the High Contracting Parties \r\nto the Fourth Geneva Convention to act urgently to \r\nuphold international humanitarian law and guarantee \r\nthe protection of civilians.\r\nThe Committee also stresses the importance of \r\nPalestinian unity under the legitimate leadership of \r\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas to secure a comprehensive \r\npeace. It expresses its concern that the accomplishments \r\nmade towards Palestinian State-building and reform \r\nare now endangered, owing to the chronic financial \r\ncrisis, and calls upon donors to meet their prior \r\n13-57987 5/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nthe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, UNICEF, the Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World \r\nFood Programme, UN-Women, the United Nations \r\nHuman Settlements Programme, the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund and the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nHere, we also express our appreciation for the \r\ncommitment of the first United Nations Development \r\nAssistance Framework for the State of Palestine, aimed \r\nat enhancing development support and assistance to \r\nthe Palestinian people and strengthening institutional \r\ncapacity in line with national priorities. Undoubtedly, \r\nthe international political, humanitarian, financial and \r\nmoral support extended over the decades has helped \r\nsustain the Palestinian people and bolster their resilience \r\nas they have confronted innumerable hardships, in exile \r\nand under occupation, while awaiting the realization \r\nof their inalienable rights, justice and peace. We are \r\ngrateful for the support, while again calling on the \r\ninternational community to exert all possible efforts, in \r\nline with relevant resolutions, the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law, to redress the injustice \r\nthe Palestinian people have endured for far too long.\r\nOur appeals to the international community are \r\ndirectly linked to the permanent responsibility of the \r\nUnited Nations towards the question of Palestine until \r\nit is resolved in all aspects. That responsibility is being \r\nupheld by the international community in many ways. \r\nHowever, political progress remains elusive, due to \r\nIsrael’s f lagrant contempt for the resolutions and the \r\nauthority of the United Nations and to the absence \r\nof political will characterized by the paralysis of the \r\nSecurity Council, which has precluded accountability \r\nby Israel, the implementation of relevant resolutions, \r\nand the advancement of a just peace.\r\nThe General Assembly, however, continues to act \r\nto uphold its responsibilities. During the last debate \r\non the question of Palestine, on 29 November 2012, \r\nthe Assembly undertook the historic, courageous \r\ndecision to accord to Palestine non-member observer \r\nState status in the United Nations. With the adoption \r\nof resolution 67/19 — which was fully consistent with \r\nthe right to self-determination enshrined in the Charter \r\nand in relevant resolutions, from resolutions 181 (II), \r\n194 (III), and Security Council resolution 242 (1967) \r\nto the present day — another milestone was set in the \r\nlong march of the Palestinian people to freedom and \r\nFinally, the Committee reiterates its view that the \r\nspecial information programme on the Question of \r\nPalestine of the Department of Public Information has \r\nmade an important contribution to informing the media \r\nand the public of the relevant issues, and requests the \r\ncontinuation of the programme.\r\nIn closing, I would like to express the hope that the \r\nreport that I have just presented will be of assistance \r\nto the General Assembly in its deliberations on the \r\nquestion of Palestine.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nPermanent Observer of the observer State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): I am honoured to address \r\nthe General Assembly at this important debate on behalf \r\nof the State of Palestine. On the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, I reaffirm the \r\ngratitude of the Palestinian people and Government for \r\nthe compelling expressions of solidarity received from \r\nall around the world, including those conveyed today \r\nat this commemorative meeting, with the participation \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People.\r\nWe express our appreciation to the Chair of \r\nthe Committee, Ambassador Diallo of Senegal, for \r\npresiding over this special meeting and for his statement \r\nand introduction of the draft resolutions on the question \r\nof Palestine today. We also express our gratitude to the \r\nRapporteur of the Committee, Ambassador Grima of \r\nMalta, for having introduced the Committee’s report \r\n(A/68/35) and to the other members of the Bureau, \r\nincluding the Ambassadors of Afghanistan, Cuba, \r\nIndonesia, Namibia and Nicaragua, and all members \r\nand observers of the Committee for their principled \r\nsupport of the just cause of Palestine. I also commend \r\nthe efforts of the Division for Palestinian Rights and \r\nthe special information programme on Palestine of the \r\nDepartment of Public Information.\r\nI thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nreport on the peaceful settlement of the question of \r\nPalestine (A/68/363) and for his tireless efforts. I would \r\nlike to express our appreciation for the support of the \r\nUnited Nations system for the noble goal of peace \r\nand for the efforts of Personal Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General Robert Serry, of the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle \r\nEast Peace Process, and of the Department of Political \r\nAffairs and all United Nations agencies on the ground \r\nassisting the Palestinian people, including, inter alia, \r\n6/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nhardships of dispossession and exile, including those \r\nresulting from the many crises that have wracked the \r\nregion, the most recent being the tragic conflict in \r\nSyria, which has gravely affected the Palestine refugee \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe State of Palestine is upholding that commitment, \r\nas reflected in the serious engagement in all stages of \r\nthe peace process from the Madrid Conference to its \r\nlegitimate actions at the United Nations to safeguard \r\nand promote the rights of the Palestinian people. We \r\ncontinue to act responsibly, respecting international law \r\nand United Nations resolutions, fully cognizant of the \r\nhigh risks entailed in a failure to seize the remaining \r\nopportunity for realizing the two-State solution, a point \r\nstarkly underscored by the Under-Secretary-General \r\nfor Political Affairs in his recent briefing to the Security \r\nCouncil (see S/PV.7063).\r\nWe have thus engaged in over 20 rounds of talks \r\nwith Israel in the context of the direct talks resumed \r\non 29 July 2013, on the initiative of United States \r\nSecretary of State Kerry and with the vital support \r\nof the League of Arab States, as well as the European \r\nUnion, the Russian Federation and the United Nations as \r\nmembers of the Quartet, and all concerned States from \r\naround the world. During the negotiations, Palestine \r\nhas maintained focus on the objectives of peace and \r\ncoexistence, determined to overcome the obstacles that \r\nhave repeatedly undermined the process.\r\nUnfortunately, despite the genuine efforts we are \r\nexerting and despite the international community’s full \r\nsupport, real progress remains elusive and hopes are \r\ndiminishing as the challenges on the ground persist. \r\nProvocative Israeli actions, distractions and declarations \r\nundermine the spirit and aim of the negotiations to \r\njustly resolve all final-status issues — Jerusalem, \r\nthe Palestinian refugees, settlements, borders, water, \r\nsecurity and prisoners. That is reflected the most in the \r\nhigh tensions and mistrust provoked by Israel’s recent \r\nthreats to construct thousands more settlement units, in \r\ngrave breach of international law, in blatant disregard \r\nfor global calls to halt them, and in contradiction of \r\nthe basis for resumed negotiations and the goals of the \r\npeace process.\r\nThe reality on the ground in occupied Palestine \r\nis critical. Illegal and destructive Israeli actions, be \r\nthey by the Government, its occupying forces or its \r\nextremist settlers, are sowing deep doubts about Israel’s \r\ntrue intentions in the negotiations. Those actions are \r\nreinforcing the notion that it is only using this period \r\nthe realization of their inalienable rights and legitimate \r\nnational aspirations.\r\nResolution 67/19 constitutes an important step \r\ntowards ensuring the State of Palestine’s rightful place \r\namong the community of nations, as the application \r\nsubmitted in 2011 by President Abbas for full United \r\nNations membership regrettably remains pending \r\nbefore the Security Council. We are certain that the \r\nAssembly’s overwhelming support for this decision \r\nwill be considered on the right side of history and \r\ndeemed an essential step towards rectifying this \r\ninjustice and fulfilling the international covenant in \r\nthis regard, 65 years after the adoption of resolution \r\n181 (II) partitioning Mandate Palestine and the onset of \r\nAl-Nakba of the Palestinian people.\r\nWe are proud that the support for resolution \r\n67/19 came from all corners of the globe, comprising \r\ncountries from every major political and regional \r\ngroup. That initiative was rightly viewed as a crucial \r\nopportunity to reaffirm support for, and to salvage, \r\nthe two-State solution at a time when its viability and \r\npopular conviction in it were being seriously eroded \r\nby the illegal policies of Israel, the occupying Power, \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, the territory constituting the State of \r\nPalestine. It was also an opportunity to reaffirm support \r\nfor the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination, \r\nfreedom from occupation and the independence of their \r\nState, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nIn fact, the global position in support of the two-\r\nState solution — based on the parameters of, inter alia, \r\nthe borders of 4 June 1967, Jerusalem as the shared \r\ncapital of the two States, and a just, agreed solution for \r\nthe Palestinian refugees, in accordance with relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, the Madrid principles, the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and the Quartet road map — is the \r\nposition to which the Palestinian people and leadership \r\nhave been committed for at least a quarter of a century, \r\nsince the formal acceptance of the two-State solution \r\nwith the adoption of the Declaration of Independence \r\nof the State of Palestine in 1988. That significant \r\ncompromise — to establish our State on only 22 per \r\ncent of our historic homeland for the sake of restoring \r\nour rights, achieving our freedom and ending the \r\nconflict — is among the boldest reflections of the \r\nPalestinian commitment to peace and coexistence with \r\nIsrael, despite the great injustice endured by our people. \r\nThat includes the Palestine refugees, who number over \r\nfive million people and continue to suffer the untold \r\n13-57987 7/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nvandalized churches and mosques and threatened \r\nthe sanctity of Al-Aqsa Mosque. The settlers act \r\nwith support, protection and incitement from Israeli \r\nofficials, who persist in encouraging colonization of \r\nthe Palestinian land and in their rejection of the two-\r\nState solution and the rights, and even existence, of the \r\nPalestinian people.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Gaza Strip, it \r\nis condemnable that the inhumane Israeli blockade has \r\nentered its seventh year, in collective punishment of the \r\nentire Palestinian civilian population there and in grave \r\nbreach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The blockade \r\nremains the cause of vast humanitarian suffering, \r\nexacerbating poverty and other socioeconomic ills \r\nand despair. It continues to impede the reconstruction \r\nof thousands of homes and of destroyed civilian \r\ninfrastructure and to prevent economic recovery, as \r\nimports remain restricted and exports nearly prohibited. \r\nA water and energy crisis also persists in Gaza. Ninety \r\nper cent of the water is unfit for human consumption, \r\nand power outages of up to 16 hours a day are severely \r\nimpairing the function of hospitals, schools, water and \r\nsanitation networks, businesses and home life.\r\nWe reiterate our calls for an end to the Israeli \r\nblockade, the illegal colonization of our land, the \r\ncollective punishment of our people and the violation \r\nof their human rights, including of the thousands of \r\nPalestinians who remain imprisoned by the occupying \r\nPower and who must be released. Such actions \r\nconstitute systematic violations of human rights law \r\nand of are grave breaches of international humanitarian \r\nlaw, under which our people are entitled to protection. \r\nThey are contrary to the good faith required to lead the \r\nnegotiations to the achievement of peace.\r\nWe reiterate that the two-State solution and Israel’s \r\nsettlement campaign are completely irreconcilable \r\nand that such illegal measures cannot be justified \r\nunder any pretext. The international consensus is \r\nclear — settlement activities are illegal, constitute the \r\nmajor obstacle to peace and must be halted. Speaking of \r\npeace while at the same time engaging in its destruction \r\nmakes a mockery of the international community’s \r\nsupport for the two-State solution and sabotages all \r\nefforts in that regard, as does claiming readiness to \r\nnegotiate without conditions while actually imposing \r\nconditions on the ground in the form of illegal facts that \r\nentrench the occupation and obstruct peace.\r\nWe are at a critical juncture in the long, historic \r\nsearch for peace, to which the State of Palestine is \r\nto further entrench its illegal settlement enterprise \r\nand de facto annexation of Palestinian land and to \r\ncontinue its subjugation of the Palestinian people, \r\nwhile simultaneously attempting to ease international \r\npressure in that regard.\r\nOver the past year, Israel has intensified its \r\naggression, colonization and collective punishment \r\nagainst the Palestinian people, in f lagrant breach \r\nof international law, including the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention, the human rights covenants, and resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly, the Security Council, the \r\nHuman Rights Council, the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil and UNESCO and other bodies, in disrespect \r\nof the advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice, and in arrogant disregard of international calls \r\nfor compliance.\r\nThis has included, inter alia, the relentless \r\nconstruction of settlements and the wall, particularly \r\nin and around occupied East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and \r\nthe Jordan Valley. Hundreds of dunums of land have \r\nbeen confiscated, and Palestinian civilians have been \r\nforcibly displaced; that has especially affected Bedouin \r\nfamilies. Hundreds of homes and properties have been \r\ndemolished, heavily targeting Palestinian Jerusalemites \r\nand Area C. There have been violent military raids by \r\nthe occupying forces, causing loss of life, injury and \r\nproperty destruction. Excessive force has been used \r\nagainst peaceful civilian protesters, and there have \r\nbeen daily arrests and detention of civilians. More \r\nthan 4,000 were arrested in the reporting period alone, \r\nas indicated by the Secretary-General. Nearly 5,000 \r\nPalestinians endure continued imprisonment under \r\nhorrific conditions and abuse, including hundreds \r\nof children and prisoners stricken with cancer and \r\nprisoners on hunger strike, whose lives are endangered.\r\nA myriad of measures obstruct the movement of \r\npersons and goods, foremost among which is the illegal \r\nblockade of the Gaza Strip. Religious sensitivities are \r\naggravated, risking the outbreak of religious conflict, \r\nwith incessant provocations by Israeli extremists \r\nagainst holy sites, especially at Al-Haram Al-Sharif, \r\nthe detention of the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, and the \r\nharassment of worshippers, including during Christian \r\nEaster observances and the Muslim holy month of \r\nRamadan.\r\nExtremist Israeli settlers have continued their \r\ncriminal rampages, terrorizing Palestinian civilians, \r\ndestroying farmlands and thousands of trees, affecting \r\nthe livelihoods of thousands of families. They have \r\n8/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nWe are at a crossroads. We reiterate our appeal to \r\nall States, intergovernmental organizations, the United \r\nNations system as a whole and civil society to extend \r\nthe support necessary to realize Palestinian-Israeli \r\npeace, which is all the more urgent in the context of the \r\ndramatic developments in our region.\r\nFor its part, the State of Palestine will continue to \r\nact responsibly, upholding its commitment to peace and \r\ncooperating with all international efforts in this regard, \r\non the basis of its belief in the rule of law and the \r\ninternational resolve to secure a just solution. Internally, \r\nwe will continue to develop our national institutions to \r\nstrengthen our State’s foundations, serve our people \r\nand ease their hardships while still under occupation. \r\nWe are grateful for the international support of those \r\nefforts, the progress of which is well documented by \r\nthe Ad Hoc Liaison Committee for the Coordination of \r\nthe International Assistance to Palestinians, the World \r\nBank and the United Nations, despite the constraints \r\nand setbacks due to Israel’s unlawful actions and the \r\nongoing financial crisis. We will also continue to \r\nstrive for reconciliation, which is so vital for achieving \r\nPalestinian national aspirations.\r\nThe Palestinian leadership is determined to bring \r\nan end to the tragedy endured by our people. We are \r\ndetermined to peacefully achieve the independence of \r\nthe State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\non the basis of the pre-1967 borders, to fulfil the \r\nrights of the Palestinian people, including Palestinian \r\nrefugees, and to establish peace and security between \r\nPalestine and Israel. We are grateful for the principled \r\nsupport of all concerned States and peoples worldwide \r\nand urge that no effort be spared to achieve long-\r\noverdue freedom, justice and dignity for the Palestinian \r\npeople. In that regard, we appeal for support for the \r\nInternational Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople in 2014 as an important contribution towards \r\nfostering the necessary momentum and political will in \r\nthe year ahead to achieve the rights of our people and \r\nmake Palestinian-Israeli peace a reality.\r\nMr. Prosor (Israel): John Fitzgerald Kennedy said \r\nthat the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie \r\nbut the myth — persistent, persuasive and unrealistic. \r\nThis is the third year that I am standing before the \r\nAssembly to make a statement on this agenda item, and \r\nonce again I experience a sense of déjà vu as I listen to \r\na distortion of history. The greatest legends of Greek \r\nmythology cannot rival the fables and fabrications that \r\nhave come to be associated with this debate.\r\nfully committed, as reflected in our adherence to the \r\nresumed negotiations and the parameters of the peace \r\nprocess upon which international consensus prevails. \r\nThe decisions made now will determine whether the \r\nsolution of two States — the State of Palestine and State \r\nof Israel living side by side in peace and security based \r\non the pre-1967 borders — will be achieved, or whether \r\nthat solution will be brought to an end by Israel’s illegal \r\npolicies.\r\nOur collective effort, no matter how well \r\nintentioned, will fail, with far-reaching consequences, \r\nif Israel persists with the illegal policies of its 46-year \r\nmilitary occupation and continues to undermine the \r\nfoundations of a peaceful solution. That will trigger \r\nthe onset of alternative efforts, political, legal and \r\npopular, to end the injustice and attain the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people — aspirations that they will never \r\nrelinquish.\r\nIn order to sustain meaningful negotiations and \r\novercome the political impasse towards the conclusion \r\nof a peace agreement, the reality on the ground must \r\nbe immediately redressed. Israel must tangibly \r\ndemonstrate, in word and in deed, its willingness to \r\nend its occupation and make peace. The mentality and \r\npolicies of occupation, in all manifestations, must end. \r\nThat is imperative to stem the decline of the situation, \r\nshore up popular belief in the possibility for peace, \r\nbuild trust between the parties and salvage this final \r\nchance for the two-State solution.\r\nIn the absence of a change in Israel’s behaviour, \r\nwe must continue to call for international action to \r\ncompel Israel, the occupying Power, to respect all of \r\nits legal obligations. The message must be conveyed \r\nthat Israel must cease all illegal policies and that the \r\nprice of occupation is steep, while much is to be gained \r\nfrom peace. Violations must be met with measures for \r\naccountability. Failure to do so would be a disservice \r\nto the cause of peace, endangering the future of the \r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples and prospects for peace \r\nand security in the Middle East and beyond.\r\nThe time is now for meaningful action to promote a \r\njust and lasting solution that will ensure the attainment \r\nof the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people and \r\nthe establishment of peace between Palestine and \r\nIsrael. That constitutes the cornerstone of Arab-Israeli \r\npeace, as set out in the Arab Peace Initiative, a historic \r\ninitiative for comprehensive regional peace.\r\n13-57987 9/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nto advancing the peace talks. Shortly after, the \r\nPalestinian Authority (PA) announced that each of \r\nthose 26 terrorists would be rewarded with $50,000, \r\nand some will earn as much as Palestinian ministers. \r\nThe motto of the PA’s pension plan seems to be “the \r\nmore you slay, the more we pay”.\r\nAs the PA sings the praises of murderers, the \r\ninternational community tunes out and mysteriously \r\nloses its voice. I wonder how taxpayers in London or \r\nLuxemburg would feel knowing that their tax dollars \r\nwere being used to reward convicted murderers? The \r\nPalestinian leadership has yet to learn an important \r\nlesson. You cannot abuse others and call yourself the \r\nabused. You cannot claim your history is being denied \r\nwhile denying the history of the Jewish nation.\r\nIn Gaza, Hamas is poisoning the hearts and minds \r\nof the next generation. They recently published a \r\ntextbook for 50,000 high-school students in which \r\npage after page denies Judaism’s historical connection \r\nto the land of Israel and describes Zionism as racism. \r\nTextbooks should be for education, but Hamas uses \r\nthem for provocation, indoctrination and escalation.\r\nThose are just the most recent examples of the \r\nincitement targeting the next generation. Terrorism does \r\nnot begin with an attack on a bus or in a pizza parlour. \r\nIt begins in classrooms, mosques and day camps where \r\nPalestinian children are being taught prejudice instead \r\nof peace, terror instead of tolerance, and martyrdom \r\ninstead of mutual understanding.\r\nThat incitement is having deadly consequences. \r\nThe number of Palestinian terror attacks against Israel \r\ndoubled from 2011 to 2012. Thus far in 2013, there have \r\nbeen 1,163 terror attacks against Israelis and dozens \r\nof attempted kidnappings. Just over a week ago, Eden \r\nAtias, a 19-year-old Israeli soldier, was stabbed to death \r\nwhile sleeping on a passenger bus. Eden was the latest \r\nvictim of the escalating terror attacks against Israelis. \r\nIn September, 20-year-old Tomer Hazan was murdered, \r\ntwo soldiers were injured in an attack near Nablus and \r\na 9-year-old girl was stabbed while playing in her front \r\nyard. In October, four Israeli civilians were injured in a \r\nstabbing attack, and Sraya Ofer was brutally beaten to \r\ndeath outside his home in the Jordan Rift Valley.\r\nAll those who claim to be working to advance \r\npeace must remind the Palestinians that there are no \r\nshortcuts. Peace is not achieved by changing a name \r\nplate at the United Nations, by unilateral actions or \r\nby adopting a string of anti-Israeli resolutions, and it \r\nThis debate may take place only once a year, but \r\nanti-Israel bias pervades the United Nations system all \r\nyear round. In 2012, the Assembly found the time to \r\nadopt 22 resolutions condemning Israel, compared with \r\nonly four that single out other nations. The worst human \r\nrights abusers receive a fraction of the condemnation \r\nthat Israel — the only democracy in the Middle \r\nEast — receives. Those irresponsible actions have \r\nirreversible consequences. The States that rubberstamp \r\nthe anti-Israel resolutions every year have given the \r\nPalestinians a false sense of reality and fed their culture \r\nof victimhood.\r\nIt has only been one year since the Assembly \r\nvoted to change the Palestinian delegation’s status at \r\nthe United Nations. To all those who voted in favour \r\nof the resolution (resolution 67/19) last November, I \r\nask the following. What exactly has changed? Did the \r\nresolution give the Palestinian Authority control over \r\nGaza? Not in the least. Gaza comprises 40 per cent of \r\nthe territory that President Abbas claims to represent, \r\nbut he has not set foot in the area in six years. It seems \r\nto me that the Palestinian Authority has been asserting \r\nmore control over some United Nations bodies than it \r\ndoes over the Gaza Strip. Since 2007, Gaza has been in \r\nthe hands of Hamas, a terrorist organization that rains \r\nmissiles on Israel’s civilians.\r\nDid the resolution adopted last year motivate the \r\nPalestinian Authority to finally hold elections? Not at \r\nall. Perhaps someone in the Assembly should remind \r\nthe Palestinian Authority that its mandate expired in \r\n2009 and that one election does not mean you can rule \r\nforever. At the same time, I have to wonder where all \r\nthe countries that claim to stand for democratic values \r\nare. They are quick to cast judgment on Israel, but fall \r\nstrangely silent when the Palestinians do not cast votes.\r\nDid the resolution adopted last year inspire the \r\nPalestinian Authority to prepare their people for peace? \r\nNot in the least. Rather than teaching their children \r\ntolerance and mutual recognition, the Palestinian \r\nleadership continues to foster a culture of incitement. \r\nPalestinian Media Watch will soon release a report \r\ndocumenting hundreds of examples of Palestinian \r\nincitement since the peace talks began. One such \r\nexample is the football teams named in honour of \r\nterrorists responsible for some of the deadliest attacks \r\nagainst Israelis. Instead of teaching kids to score goals, \r\nthe Palestinian leadership’s goal is to glorify murderers.\r\nIsrael recently made the difficult decision to release \r\n26 convicted murderers as part of its commitment \r\n10/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nthat the Palestinian people return to the Jewish State. \r\nThat is a euphemism for the destruction of the State of \r\nIsrael and the single greatest hurdle to achieving peace. \r\nMany in this Hall are convinced that the root of the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict is the settlements. In fact, \r\nfrom the time that Israel gained its independence in \r\n1948, until 1967, the West Bank was in Jordanian hands \r\nand Gaza in Egyptian hands. Throughout that time \r\nthere was not a single settlement, yet the Palestinians \r\nstill sought our destruction. Today, just 2 per cent of \r\nthe Israeli population lives in settlements, but they \r\nare blamed for 100 per cent of the problems. The math \r\nsimply does not add up.\r\nIsrael is the ancient homeland of the Jewish people. \r\nIt is the birthplace of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; the \r\nland where Moses and Joshua led the Jewish people \r\nand King Solomon built the Jewish Temple. Israel is \r\nthe place where the Bible tells us about David, who \r\nwas made king and laid the cornerstone for his palace \r\nin Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people. \r\nThat was King David from Judea, not King David from \r\nthe West Bank, and certainly not King David from \r\nthe so-called occupied territories. After all, a person \r\ncannot occupy his own home. And for thousands of \r\nyears, Jerusalem served as the capital of the Jewish \r\npeople. Three thousand years ago, my ancestors walked \r\nthe same streets that my children walk, spoke the same \r\nlanguage that I speak and prayed at the very same \r\nTemple Mount where millions of Jews pray every day.\r\nYet all of those historical facts are brushed aside. \r\nInstead, all we hear in the Assembly are rants, rhetoric \r\nand biased resolutions. It does not take a fortune teller \r\nto predict the language in those resolutions. After all, \r\nthe same text is copied and pasted each year, much of it \r\ndating back five decades. Yet country after country sees \r\nno problem in standing up and parroting propaganda. I \r\nam reminded of words that are sometimes ascribed to \r\nPresident John F. Kennedy, to the effect that however \r\nbig the propaganda may be, if it is repeated often \r\nenough the masses will regard it as the truth.\r\nThe draft resolutions being voted on today \r\n(A/68/L.12, A/68/L.13, A/68/L.14 and A/68/L.15) \r\nhave no relationship to the facts on the ground. Just \r\nlast week the United Nations adopted nine resolutions \r\ncondemning Israel. One of them condemned Israel’s \r\ntreatment of the Syrian people. Israel’s treatment \r\nof the Syrian people? It is inconceivable that while \r\nIsraeli hospitals are treating Syrians who have escaped \r\nAl-Assad’s massacre, the United Nations is denouncing \r\nwill not be achieved in Manhattan’s Midtown East, but \r\nrather in the Middle East. So long as the Palestinian \r\nleadership chooses symbolism over pragmatism, it will \r\nbe harder to achieve peace.\r\nIn a few days, on 29 November, the United Nations \r\nwill observe the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. Let me take a moment to remind \r\nthe Assembly of what really occurred on that day in \r\nhistory. On 29 November 1947, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II), which came to be known \r\nas the partition plan. That resolution provided for the \r\nestablishment of a Jewish State and an Arab State. The \r\nJews accepted huge compromises and gave up on dreams \r\nthe Jewish people had harboured for generations. But \r\nthey welcomed the plan and joyously declared a new \r\nState in their ancient homeland. Chaim Weizmann, who \r\nlater became the first President of the State of Israel, \r\nproclaimed,\r\n“It is the profound desire of our people to establish \r\nrelations of harmony and mutual respect with their \r\nArab fellow citizens [and] with the neighbouring \r\nArab States”.\r\nRather than accept the partition plan, five surrounding \r\nArab nations declared war on the newborn Jewish State. \r\nTheir intentions were made clear by Azzam Pasha, the \r\nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States, who \r\nsaid,\r\n“[I]t will be a war of elimination and it will be a \r\ndangerous massacre which history will record \r\nsimilarly to the Mongol massacre or the wars of the \r\nCrusades.”\r\nThe Arabs not only rejected the United Nations \r\noffer of a Palestinian State, they then declared war \r\nagainst the Jewish State. Since losing that war, they \r\nhave perpetuated the Palestinian refugee problem and \r\nstill have the audacity to demand solidarity. Broadway \r\nmay be down the street in New York, but the real theatre \r\nis here at the United Nations. In this Hall, the Arab \r\nnations shine a spotlight on the Palestinian refugees, \r\nbut back home in the Middle East they leave them in the \r\ndark. Since 1948, the Arab States have refused to accept \r\nthe Palestinian refugees into their societies, confined \r\nthem to refugee camps and passed discriminatory laws.\r\nResolution 181 (II) speaks of the creation of a “Jewish \r\nState” no fewer than 25 times. And yet today, 66 years \r\nlater, has anyone heard Palestinian leaders utter the \r\nterm “Jewish State”? Of course not. Palestinian leaders \r\ncall for an independent Palestinian State, but they insist \r\n13-57987 11/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\none where our people can live in security, free from \r\nviolence, and where the horizon is ripe with opportunity \r\nand our children can live side by side in peace.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to address the General Assembly today \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on \r\nagenda item 36, entitled “Question of Palestine”.\r\nThis important debate coincides with the \r\ncommemoration of the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian people. On this day, the \r\ninternational community reaffirms its continued and \r\nunwavering support for, and solidarity with, the long-\r\nsuffering people of Palestine in their national struggle \r\nto achieve the independence of their State, peace and \r\njustice. NAM pays tribute to the resilience of the \r\nPalestinian people in their pursuit of their legitimate \r\nnational aspirations, which they have for too long been \r\nunjustly denied.\r\nFollowing the historic adoption by the General \r\nAssembly of resolution 67/19, of 29 November 2012, \r\nwhich accorded to Palestine non-member observer \r\nState status in the United Nations, Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, has blatantly intensified its illegal settlement \r\nactivities, along with many other unlawful policies \r\nand practices in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem. The situation continues to \r\nbe extremely severe in the Jordan Valley — where \r\nthousands of Palestinians, including hundreds of \r\nBedouin families, have been displaced and thousands \r\nmore are at risk of forced displacement due to Israel’s \r\nillegal colonization — as well as in and around occupied \r\nEast Jerusalem, where the occupying Power continues \r\nto pursue measures aimed at the quiet transfer or \r\ndepopulation of the indigenous Palestinian inhabitants \r\nand at ensuring a Jewish majority in the city. In that \r\nregard, NAM calls for a complete end to all Israeli \r\nsettlement activities, the construction of the wall, \r\nhome demolitions, residency revocations, excavation, \r\nincluding near Al-Haram Al-Sharif, and the closure of \r\nPalestinian institutions in the city.\r\nWe condemn Israel’s detention and imprisonment \r\nof thousands of Palestinians, including women and \r\nchildren, who are subjected to deplorable conditions \r\nof captivity and all forms of ill treatment. We also \r\ncondemn the ongoing terror, violence and provocations \r\nby extremist Israeli settlers against Palestinian \r\ncivilians and property, including homes, agricultural \r\nlands and Muslim and Christian holy sites. We caution \r\nthat such actions are fuelling religious sensitivities, \r\nIsrael’s treatment of Syrians. As if that were not enough, \r\nthe General Assembly will soon vote on another draft \r\nresolution calling on Israel to hand over the Golan \r\nHeights and its residents to Syria. It is nothing short of \r\nabsurd for the United Nations to demand that even more \r\ncivilians be subject to Al-Assad’s brutality.\r\nAt the United Nations, there are countless resolutions \r\nthat delegitimize and demonize Israel. Why do I never \r\nhear anyone speak about all the good work that Israel \r\nis doing for the Palestinians? While the Palestinians \r\nare busy condemning Israel at the United Nations, \r\nIsrael is busy supporting the Palestinian economy and \r\ndeveloping its infrastructure. Today, more than 100,000 \r\nPalestinians earn their living in Israel, making up more \r\nthan 10 per cent of Palestinian gross domestic product. \r\nIsrael is also building four electrical substations and \r\nproviding more than 1,400 million gallons of clean \r\nwater annually. Palestinians receive world-class health-\r\ncare services in hospitals throughout the country. In the \r\nfirst half of 2013 alone, more than 94,000 Palestinians \r\nreceived treatment in Israeli hospitals. And we continue \r\nto give, even as our goodwill is knowingly exploited. \r\nWhile the Israel Defense Forces uncover one terror \r\ntunnel after another, the f low of consumer goods \r\ncontinues into Gaza uninterrupted. Each day, the State \r\nof Israel delivers 400 truckloads to the Palestinian \r\npeople via the Keren Shalom terminal.\r\nIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth \r\nis a revolutionary act — a remark that has been \r\nattributed to George Orwell. The truth is that Israel is \r\nnot just speaking about peace; it is demonstrating its \r\ncommitment every single day. Peace is a central value \r\nof Israel’s society, and it has been the goal of the Israeli \r\npeople and every Israeli leader since the State was \r\nre-established, 65 years ago. We will not be deterred \r\nfrom that goal. Israel has always extended its hand for \r\npeace, and it will continue to do so for our children \r\nand grandchildren. When we faced an Arab leader who \r\nwanted peace, we made peace. That was the case with \r\nEgypt and with Jordan. We are committed to negotiating \r\nwith our Palestinian neighbours so that our two peoples \r\ncan live side by side in peace, dignity and freedom.\r\nI call on my colleagues in this Hall not to be \r\ndistracted by unilateral efforts and biased resolutions. \r\nRemind the Palestinians to take responsibility and that \r\nthe only way to reach a comprehensive peace deal is \r\nthrough hard work and direct negotiations. Working \r\ntogether, we in this Hall can all make history by making \r\npeace. Working together, we can author a better future, \r\n12/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\n1860 (2009) and all other relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions.\r\nIsrael has continued its arbitrary and abusive \r\nimprisonment and detention of thousands of \r\nPalestinian civilians, including children as young as \r\n12 years old, who are being subjected, inter alia, to \r\nforced interrogation, violent beatings, psychological \r\nharassment and humiliation, unhygienic conditions, \r\nsolitary confinement, torture, denial of access to \r\nmedical care, education, family visits and medical \r\nneglect, leading to death. It is the conviction of the \r\nMovement, as stated in the Declaration on Palestine \r\nPolitical Prisoners, drafted at the May 2012 Ministerial \r\nMeeting of the Coordinating Bureau of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, and adopted by the sixteenth Summit of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement,held in Tehran in August \r\n2012, that Palestinian prisoners should be immediately \r\nreleased and their plight addressed by the international \r\ncommunity, particularly the Security Council and the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nNAM expresses deep concern at the lack of \r\nprogress in the Middle East peace process and regrets \r\nthe fact that, even as peace negotiations have resumed, \r\npessimism is overtaking hope, as every passing day \r\nreaffirms that Israel, the occupying Power, is more \r\ninterested in maintaining its control over Palestinian \r\nland than in achieving a just peace. For that objective, \r\nthe occupying Power has relied primarily on its \r\nsettlement activities — perpetrated in grave breach of \r\ninternational humanitarian law — in addition to other \r\nunlawful practices aimed at the isolation, separation \r\nand subjugation of the Palestinian people, which \r\nconstitute gross human rights violations and collective \r\npunishment.\r\nIn that connection, we stress the need for intensified \r\nand coordinated efforts by the international community \r\nto compel Israel, the occupying Power, to cease its illegal \r\npolicies and genuinely commit to the peace process \r\non the basis of United Nations resolutions and long-\r\nstanding agreed terms of reference. The international \r\ncommunity must act to prevent a total collapse of the \r\npeace process after so many years of effort and support \r\nfor the process, on the basis of a clear foundation rooted \r\nin international law, United Nations resolutions and the \r\ninternational consensus on the two-State solution, based \r\non the pre-1967 borders and a just and comprehensive \r\nsolution to the plight of the Palestine refugees on the \r\nbasis of resolution 194 (III).\r\nwhich risk further destabilization and must be brought \r\nto an immediate end by the occupying Power, which \r\nbears responsibility for all of the illegal colonization \r\nactivities in the occupied Palestinian territory and for \r\ntheir consequences and must be held accountable for \r\nthose crimes.\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, continues the illegal \r\nconstruction of settlements and networks of Israeli-\r\nonly bypass roads linking settlements, the confiscation \r\nof vast land areas and the transfer of Israeli settlers to \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory, as it has f lagrantly \r\npushed ahead with its plans to colonize and de facto \r\nannex more Palestinian land, even in the midst of a peace \r\nprocess. The Non-Aligned Movement remains firm in \r\nits condemnation of Israel’s illegal settlement policies \r\nand practices. We stress that all such unlawful attempts \r\nto alter the demographic composition, character and \r\nstatus of the occupied Palestinian territory, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, are all null and void and have no \r\nvalidity whatsoever. In that connection, the Movement \r\ncalls for urgent action and practical measures by the \r\ninternational community, in particular by the Security \r\nCouncil, to compel the occupying Power to cease \r\ncompletely its settlement campaign in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and \r\nto abide by all of its obligations under international \r\nlaw, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, United \r\nNations resolutions, the advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/ES-10/273) and its \r\nobligations under the road map in that regard.\r\nThe sea, air and land blockade of Gaza imposed \r\nby Israel, the occupying Power, entered its seventh \r\nyear in June, deepening poverty and despair among \r\nthe more than 1.7 million Palestinians living there. \r\nThe devastating impact of the illegal blockade and \r\nthe repercussions of the trauma, destruction and \r\ndisplacement inflicted by Israeli military aggression, \r\nparticularly in 2008, 2009 and 2012, have continued to \r\nimpact every human right and to disrupt every aspect \r\nof life. The blockade constitutes collective punishment \r\nof the entire Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, \r\nwhich is in grave breach of international humanitarian \r\nlaw, in particular the Fourth Geneva Convention. In that \r\nregard, the Movement calls upon Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to promptly and unconditionally end its illegal \r\nblockade of the Gaza Strip and to open all its crossing \r\npoints to ensure the regular and sustained movement of \r\npersons and goods, in accordance with its obligations \r\nunder international law, Security Council resolution \r\n13-57987 13/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nmajority, the resolution expresses the broad support of \r\nthe international community for the establishment of \r\nan independent Palestinian State in the context of the \r\ntwo-State solution. It also reflects the firm belief of \r\nvarious segments of the international community that \r\nno alternative exists to seeking peace and stability, in \r\naccordance with the relevant international frameworks, \r\nin order to open new vistas for all the peoples of the \r\nregion.\r\nThe international community was optimistic \r\nwhen direct negotiations resumed between the Israeli \r\nand Palestinian sides under the auspices of the United \r\nStates. It expressed its full support and encouragement \r\nfor the steps taken, which should involve maximum \r\nefforts so as not to squander the opportunity, especially \r\ngiven the current situation in the Middle East. Any \r\nfurther setbacks and disappointments can no longer be \r\ntolerated. The members of the League of Arab States \r\nwere among the first to support those efforts. The \r\nArab League hopes that those efforts will culminate in \r\na comprehensive and lasting solution to the Palestine \r\nquestion that allows the Palestinian people to regain \r\nits rights, makes possible the establishment of an \r\nindependent State along the June 1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, and leads to the secure \r\nand peaceful coexistence of all parties in the region.\r\nUnfortunately, that is not what we see on the \r\nground today when it comes to Israel’s stance, practices \r\nand the provocative statements made by a number of \r\nits officials. That runs counter to the serious approach \r\nneeded to achieve the desired peace, and threatens \r\nongoing negotiations and the prospects for a resolution \r\nbetween the two sides.\r\nThe Israeli settlements are a gross violation of the \r\nrules of international law regulating the legal status of \r\nterritories under foreign occupation. They also seek \r\nto change the character of the occupied territories. \r\nThat involves the threat of partitioning the Palestinian \r\nterritories and their fragmentation, imperilling the \r\nprospects for the establishment of the Palestinian State. \r\nIn that context, the Arab Group calls for ending the \r\nsettlement activities, which are a gross violation of \r\nthe norms of international law, and for adherence to \r\nthe United Nations resolutions regarding international \r\nlegitimacy and the terms of reference of the peace \r\nprocess.\r\nWe continue to condemn the acts of aggression by \r\nthe occupying authorities and by Israeli settlers against \r\nthe Palestinians, the confiscation of their land, the \r\nThe Movement welcomes all efforts and initiatives \r\naimed at realizing justice for the Palestinian people and \r\nstresses the importance of the admission of the State \r\nof Palestine as a non-member observer State by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, on 29 November 2012, as well as \r\nits admission as a Member State by the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization \r\nGeneral Conference. We consider that development \r\nto be a vote of confidence affirming that Palestine \r\nmeets the Charter’s criteria for statehood, and that it is \r\nready and willing to assume its responsibilities under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We are optimistic \r\nthat the General Assembly’s granting of non-member \r\nobserver State status to Palestine will help accelerate \r\nthe momentum in the Security Council regarding its \r\npending United Nations application.\r\nIn conclusion, the Movement reaffirms its \r\nunwavering commitment to a just and comprehensive \r\nsolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, with the question \r\nof Palestine at its core, and to the immediate restoration \r\nof the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to \r\nexercise its self-determination and sovereignty in an \r\nindependent State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital.\r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to speak on behalf of the Arab Group in \r\nthe debate on agenda item 36, regarding the question of \r\nPalestine, which coincides with the commemoration of \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. This is an important occasion, at which the \r\ninternational community reiterates its solidarity with, \r\nand support for, the fraternal Palestinian people in \r\nits long struggle to achieve its legitimate aspirations \r\nto self-determination, to live in dignity, peace and \r\nstability and to build its independent State.\r\nI would like to thank Ambassador Diallo, Chairman \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, for his statement and for \r\nintroducing the various draft resolutions on Palestine. \r\nWe also thank the ambassador of Malta for introducing \r\nthe Committee’s report (A/68/35). We would also like \r\nto thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his report \r\non the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine \r\n(A/68/363).\r\nThe Assembly’s adoption of resolution 67/19 at this \r\ntime last year, which accorded Palestine the status of \r\na non-member observer State at the United Nations, \r\nwas a very important landmark in the history of the \r\nPalestinian people. Adopted by an overwhelming \r\n14/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nwater and the release of Palestinian prisoners and \r\ndetainees”.\r\nFinally, I cannot but reaffirm the fact that the Arab \r\nGroup is committed to achieving a just, durable and \r\ncomprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict on \r\nall tracks, foremost of which is the Palestine question. \r\nThe Group reiterates that there is a need to restore \r\nall the Palestinian people’s legitimate and inalienable \r\nrights to self-determination, within an independent, \r\nsovereign State within the June 1967 borders and with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union. The \r\ncandidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Montenegro and Serbia; the countries of \r\nthe Stabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidates Albania and Bosnia and Herzegovina; the \r\nEuropean Free Trade Area country Liechtenstein, a \r\nmember of the European Economic Area, as well as \r\nUkraine and the Republic of Moldova, align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nThe European Union has long argued that the \r\nhistorical changes under way in the Middle East made \r\nthe need for progress on the Middle East peace process \r\nall the more urgent. We remain convinced that now is \r\nthe time for the Palestinians’ aspirations for statehood \r\nand sovereignty and the Israelis’ for security to be \r\nfulfilled through a comprehensive, negotiated peace \r\nbased on the two-State solution and ending all claims. \r\nFor that reason, the European Union warmly welcomed \r\nthe resumption of direct negotiations between the \r\nparties and commended the bold leadership shown by \r\nPresident Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu. We \r\nalso commended the fundamental role played by the \r\nUnited States, and the dedication of Secretary of State \r\nJohn Kerry and the important support expressed by the \r\nLeague of Arab States.\r\nWe also stressed the importance of the fact that \r\nthe resumption of negotiations would lead to tangible \r\nand timely progress, a point that is even more relevant \r\ntoday. The two parties need to remain committed \r\nto the negotiation process and should refrain from \r\nactions that could undermine the prospects for peace. \r\nWe call on both leaders to continue to show the bold \r\nleadership needed to overcome the challenges ahead \r\nand to take the difficult decisions that are necessary if \r\ndemolition of their homes and the infringement of their \r\nmost fundamental rights, including those of prisoners \r\nand detainees. Such practices are, in the opinion of \r\nsegments of the international community, a breach \r\nof international legitimacy, and a blatant challenge \r\nto the principles of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law. The Arab Group also condemns the \r\nrepeated acts of aggression by the occupation authorities \r\nand Israeli settlers against Al-Quds Al-Sharif and its \r\nChristian and Islamic landmarks. Israel is seeking to \r\nalter its geographic and demographic character, in \r\naddition to desecrating Islamic and Christian houses \r\nof worship — especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque — and \r\nabusing their visitors.\r\nThe Group calls for the total lifting of the stif ling \r\nIsraeli embargo imposed on Gaza since 2007. We \r\nmust put an end to the serious and tragic economic \r\nrepercussions for the Palestinian population, including \r\nwomen and children, resulting from it, which deprives \r\nit of the most rudimentary possibilities of earning a \r\ndecent livelihood.\r\nThe Arab Group affirms the contents of the \r\nstatement issued by the meeting of the Ministerial \r\nCommittee for the Arab Peace Initiative held last week \r\nin Kuwait. The Committee reiterated\r\n“its support for the resumed negotiations, while \r\nwarning of the risks resulting from the continued \r\nacts of aggression and practices of Israel, including \r\nthe settlement policies, which risk derailing the \r\ncurrent negotiations. The Committee calls on the \r\nUnited States and other members of the Quartet \r\nto compel the Israeli Government to cease all \r\nits destructive policies and practices, which are \r\ndetrimental to the current path of negotiations and \r\nthe peace process”.\r\nThe Arab Group recalls the fact that the Committee \r\nreiterated that it was\r\n“committed to the principles, contents and terms \r\nof reference of the Arab Peace Initiative to achieve \r\njust peace in the region based on international \r\nlaw and the relevant resolutions of the United \r\nNations — putting an end to the Israeli occupation \r\nof Palestinian territories and establishing an \r\nindependent Palestinian State along the June 1967 \r\nborders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nthereby resolving all final-status issues, including \r\nconcerning borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, \r\n13-57987 15/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nArea C. Social and economic developments in Area C \r\nare of critical importance for the viability of a future \r\nPalestinian State, since Area C is its main land reserve.\r\nThe European Union remains the largest donor to \r\nthe Palestinian Authority and has constantly encouraged \r\nand supported the Palestinian State-building process. \r\nHowever, we are particularly concerned with the slowing \r\neconomic development in the Palestinian territory and \r\nthe difficult fiscal situation that is producing. We will \r\ncontinue to play our part. At the same time, we call on \r\nother donors, especially those in the region, to increase \r\ntheir financial support to the Palestinian Authority.\r\nThe European Union followed with great concern \r\nthe hostilities that affected the Gaza Strip and Israel \r\nin November 2012, and regretted the loss of civilian \r\nlives on both sides. We renew our condemnation in the \r\nstrongest terms of any violence deliberately targeting \r\ncivilians. We welcomed the ceasefire that put an end to \r\nthose hostilities, and we urge all parties to fully comply \r\nwith its provisions.\r\nAt the same time, we must recognize and underline \r\nthat the present situation in Gaza is unsustainable and \r\nwill remain so as long as it remains politically and \r\neconomically separated from the West Bank. Fully \r\nrecognizing Israel’s legitimate security concerns, \r\nincluding with regard to vital threats in the region, and \r\nexpressing its appreciation for some recent positive \r\nmeasures by Israel with regard to the opening of the \r\ncrossings for commercial goods, the European Union \r\ncontinues to call for the immediate, sustained and \r\nunconditional opening of crossings for the f low of \r\nhumanitarian aid, commercial goods and persons to and \r\nfrom the Gaza Strip. To that end, the European Union \r\ncalls for the full implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1860 (2009), full respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law and the full implementation of the \r\n2005 Agreement on Movement and Access.\r\nThe European Union also continues to call for \r\nintra-Palestinian reconciliation behind President Abbas \r\nin line with the principles set out in his speech of 4 May \r\n2011, as an important element for the unity of a future \r\nPalestinian State and for reaching a two-State solution.\r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIn conclusion, the European Union reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the two-State solution. We have before \r\nus a historic opportunity to reach an agreement to \r\nfinally end this conflict. We are convinced that such \r\na comprehensive agreement is to be reached within the \r\nnine-month agreed time frame.\r\nThe European Union will continue to remain \r\nsupportive of the process and committed to ensuring \r\nits success. As negotiations progress, we intend to \r\ngive further concrete form to our support, in line with \r\nwhat will be agreed by the parties. We will continue to \r\ncontribute, together with other regional and international \r\npartners, including within the Quartet, to a negotiated \r\nsolution on all final-status issues, including Jerusalem, \r\nborders, security, water and refugees. In so doing, we \r\nwill continue to be inspired by our clear positions with \r\nregard to parameters, principles and issues, including \r\nthose expressed in the conclusions of the Foreign Affairs \r\nCouncil of December 2009, December 2010, May 2011, \r\nJuly 2011, May 2012, December 2012 and July 2013, \r\nwhich I would like to reaffirm on this occasion.\r\nThe European Union deplores the recent Israeli \r\ndecisions to advance settlement expansion in East \r\nJerusalem and the West Bank. Our position is clear: \r\nsettlements, the separation barrier where built on \r\noccupied land, the demolition of homes and evictions \r\nare illegal under international law. Such activities \r\nconstitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to make \r\na two-State solution impossible. The European Union \r\nreiterates that it will not recognize any changes to the \r\npre-1967 borders, including with regard to Jerusalem, \r\nother than those agreed by the parties. All settlement \r\nactivity, including in East Jerusalem, should cease \r\nimmediately. New construction plans should be \r\nabandoned. All outposts erected since March 2001 \r\nshould be dismantled. A way should be found through \r\nnegotiations to resolve the status of Jerusalem as the \r\nfuture capital of two States.\r\nThe European Union is also gravely concerned \r\nabout the serious limitations on the Palestinian \r\nAuthority with respect to promoting the economic \r\ndevelopment of Palestinian communities in Area C \r\nand about their worsening living conditions. The \r\nEuropean Union and its member States are particularly \r\nconcerned by the instances of collective demolitions \r\nin recent months, often resulting in the displacement \r\nof Palestinians, including Bedouin communities. We \r\nare convinced that Palestinians require access to a \r\nfair planning and zoning regime so as not to resort to \r\nbuilding without an Israeli permit, which can lead to \r\ndemolitions. We also reiterate our call for Israel to work \r\ntogether with the Palestinian Authority to allow more \r\naccess to, and control by the Palestinian Authority over, \r\n16/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nWe call on the international community to put \r\npressure on Israel to unconditionally cease its aggressive \r\npractices and its illegal blockade of Gaza, to open \r\nall border crossings and to stop all illegal settlement \r\nactivities in the occupied territories. We urge Israel \r\nto put an end to its repeated attacks on the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque and its attempts to alter the geographic and \r\ndemographic nature of Jerusalem and to comply with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), \r\n1397 (2002), 1515 (2003) and 1860 (2009), which call \r\nfor Israel to withdraw from all territories occupied in \r\n1967.\r\nIn that context, we call for the immediate release \r\nof all Palestinians detained in Israeli jails, specifically \r\nthe sick and the children, as well as those detained \r\nbefore the Oslo Agreement. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to put pressure on Israel to ensure the fair \r\ntreatment of Palestinian prisoners in accordance with \r\ninternational law, the Fourth Geneva Convention and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, as a first step towards \r\ntheir release.\r\nWe call on Israel to implement Security Council \r\nresolution 497 (1981), which calls for Israel to withdraw \r\nfrom the occupied Syrian Golan to the pre-June 1967 \r\nborders.\r\nWe also support the brotherly country of Lebanon \r\nand its efforts to protect its security and to preserve its \r\nterritorial integrity. We call on Israel to put an end to its \r\naggression against Lebanon from the land and the air \r\nand to withdraw from all occupied Lebanese territories, \r\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 1701 \r\n(2006).\r\nIn conclusion, we support all legitimate aspirations \r\nof the brotherly and steadfast Palestinian people. The \r\npeople of Kuwait and its leadership will continue to \r\nprovide political, moral and financial support to the \r\nbrotherly people of Palestine in order to put an end to \r\nthe Israeli occupation and to establish a Palestinian \r\nState, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of international law \r\nand international terms of reference. We hope that the \r\nPalestinian State will soon become the 194th State \r\nMember of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba welcomes the report of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/68/35) and fully associates itself with the \r\nstatement made earlier by the representative of the \r\nan agreement would open the door to deepened and \r\nenhanced cooperation between the European Union \r\nand all the countries of the region, thereby contributing \r\nto the prospect for a new era of peace, security and \r\nprosperity.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, we wish to align ourselves with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Tunisia on behalf \r\nof the Arab Group and the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nThe General Assembly debate on this important \r\nitem coincides with the commemoration of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople and the first anniversary of resolution 67/19, on \r\nthe recognition of Palestine as a non-member observer \r\nState at the United Nations. In that context, we express \r\nour thanks and appreciation to the Secretary-General \r\nand the various United Nations entities, in particular \r\nthe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People and the Special Committee \r\nto Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human \r\nRights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the \r\nOccupied Territories.\r\nWe support all regional and international efforts \r\nto reach a final solution, especially the ongoing \r\nnegotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides to \r\nachieve a solution on all final-status issues, including \r\nborders, settlements, water, Jerusalem, refugees and \r\nsecurity. We commend the United States for its role in \r\nfacilitating the resumption of negotiations. However, \r\nIsraeli practices may undermine the possibility of \r\nreaching a final solution. Israel continues to build new \r\nsettlement units and to expand existing settlements \r\nin complete disregard for its international obligations \r\nand for the calls of the international community to end \r\nthose illegal practices, which contravene the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention of 1949. The Israeli Government \r\nalso continues to confiscate land and to restrict \r\nthe movement of people and goods by dividing up \r\nthe Palestinian territories. The economic blockade \r\nimposed by Israel on Gaza has entered its seventh \r\nyear, exacerbating the suffering of the Palestinian \r\npeople. The fact that thousands of Palestinian citizens, \r\nincluding women and children, remain in Israeli jails \r\nalso contravenes international law and international \r\nhumanitarian law and is a major source of continuing \r\ntension in the region.\r\n13-57987 17/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nwere interrelated and formed part of an overall \r\npattern of violations that was primarily characterized \r\nby the denial of the right to self-determination and \r\ninstitutionalized discrimination against the Palestinian \r\npeople.\r\nThe aggressive acts of Israeli settlers against \r\nPalestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem \r\ncontinue. The illegal contruction of the wall in the \r\noccupied West Bank continues, in violation of the \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \r\nof 9 July 2004 (see A/ES-10/273). The restrictions have \r\ncaused severe losses to the majority of the population, \r\nwho do not have access to medical, educational and \r\nsocial services or the markets and holy sites in East \r\nJerusalem.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report of the Fact-\r\nFinding Mission, Israel carried out the demolition of \r\nat least 594 Palestinian-owned structures, displacing at \r\nleast 924 people. During the reporting period, Israeli \r\nforces killed at least 196 Palestinians and injured more \r\nthan 1,600 people in the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israeli \r\nforces caused the deaths of 20 Palestinians and injured \r\nmore than 4,200 people in the West Bank and East \r\nJerusalem during clashes.\r\nThe restrictions on the movement of people and \r\ngoods from and to the Gaza Strip continued to cause a \r\ndeterioration in the living conditions of the 1.7 million \r\nPalestinian residents, including women and children.\r\nI have mentioned only some of the alarming data \r\nprovided to us by the recent report of the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, which vividly depicts the serious violations that \r\nIsrael continues to perpetrate against the Palestinian \r\npeople.\r\nCuba renews its strong condemnation of those \r\nactions and of Israel’s illegal occupation of the \r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. Cuba \r\ndemands that the occupying Power immediately halt \r\nits acts of aggression. The international community \r\nmust not remain unmoved any longer at the continued \r\ndeterioration of the situation and must take action to \r\nensure that the relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council are respected.\r\nThe Security Council must take the responsibility \r\nincumbent upon it and must accept, without any further \r\ndelay, the request made by the State of Palestine in \r\n2011 for recognition as a State Member of the United \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nWith today’s debate we add to the long list of \r\ndiscussions in the United Nations on the question of \r\nPalestine that have not led to an effective solution that \r\ncan put an end to Israel’s crimes against the Palestinian \r\npeople and that will make it possible for them to fully \r\nexercise their inalienable right to self-determination in \r\na fully independent State of Palestine.\r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, continues to defy \r\nthe international community by persisting in its \r\ntransgression of international norms and treaties and \r\nin its non-compliance with General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nThe report of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People notes \r\nthe worsening situation in the region, in particular in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories, including East \r\nJerusalem. That is particularly as a result of Israel’s \r\nexcessive use of force against the Palestinian civilian \r\npopulation and the many other illegal policies and \r\npractices, such as the expansion of Israeli settlements, \r\ncontinuing human rights violations and collective \r\npunishment, which cause the Palestinian people \r\nimmense suffering.\r\nOn 29 November 2012, the General Assembly \r\nadopted by an overwhelming majority resolution 67/19, \r\nwhich granted Palestine the status of non-member \r\nobserver State at the United Nations. That led to \r\nIsrael’s announcement of its intention to build more \r\nthan 3,000 housing units in the occupied territories, \r\nincluding in occupied East Jerusalem, and to withhold \r\nfrom Palestine the tax and customs revenue collected \r\non behalf of the Palestinians.\r\nCuba reiterates its condemnation of the ongoing \r\nexpansion of all illegal Israeli settlements in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, as \r\nwell as the continuing violation of Security Council \r\nresolutions and the Fourth Geneva Convention.\r\nThe Independent International Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the implications of the Israeli settlements \r\non the civil, political, economic, social and cultural \r\nrights of the Palestinian people throughout the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, \r\nappointed by the Human Rights Council, concluded that \r\nthe settlement policy contravened a multitude of human \r\nrights of the Palestinian people and that the violations \r\n18/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nwork of the Secretary-General and the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople.\r\nMy delegation thanks the Secretary-General for \r\nthe compilation of his report (A/68/363), in accordance \r\nwith resolution 67/23, and we thank the Committee of \r\nfor its report (A/68/35).\r\nNext Friday will mark the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. I wish to reiterate \r\nthe solidarity of my Government and that of the people \r\nof Maldives with the Palestinian people’s inalienable \r\nright to self-determination. The Maldives will remain \r\nsteadfast in support of Palestine, and we will not falter \r\nin our condemnation of the serious injustices being \r\ncommitted in the occupied territories. The political \r\nand religious authorities of both sides need to ensure \r\nthat the cultural and religious rights of all people are \r\nrespected, and that the right to live free from fear and \r\nabuse is respected.\r\nIt has been 66 years since the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II), on the partition of Palestine. \r\nYet we still find ourselves in this Hall today expressing \r\nour concerns about how little progress has been made. \r\nThe situation has become a never-ending conflict that \r\ntakes place not only on the battlefield but on city streets \r\nand in the homes of innocents.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report notes that, during \r\nthe previous reporting period, 338 Palestinians were \r\nkilled, including 232 Palestinian civilians and eight \r\nIsraelis. Those figures not only represent an increase \r\nin the violence of an ongoing conflict, but demonstrate \r\nthe true nature of the conflict. Although this is a \r\nwar zone, it is not a war: it is an occupation. It is the \r\ndisenfranchisement of a nation to exist and of a people \r\nto be free. It is the theft of their economic right to \r\nprosper and their right to hope for a brighter future.\r\nWe have not given up hope. Our Government \r\nwelcomed the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace \r\ntalks in August with the active mediation of the United \r\nStates. In that regard, my delegation commends the \r\nArab Peace Initiative, the Government of Egypt, \r\nthe United States and the United Nations for their \r\nexemplary leadership. My delegation is fully in line \r\nwith the principled position that a permanent settlement \r\nof the question of Palestine can be reached only by \r\nending the occupation that began in 1967, achieving the \r\nindependence of the State of Palestine on the basis of \r\nthe pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nNation. That is the express wish of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the States that make up the Organization. \r\nThe passivity of the Security Council before Israel’s \r\ncrimes, owing to the threat or the use of the veto by one \r\nof its permanent members, is the highest expression of \r\nhypocrisy on the part of those who are self-appointed \r\nparagons in defending and respecting human rights \r\nwhen it comes to criticizing or punishing developing \r\ncountries that disagree with their policies or defy the \r\npolitical, social or economic order they want to impose.\r\nCuba supports the initiative of the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople to have the General Assembly proclaim an \r\ninternational year of solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople in order to increase international awareness of \r\nthe cause.\r\nBefore I conclude, I wish to commend, on behalf \r\nof Cuba, the decision of Guyana and El Salvador to \r\nestablish diplomatic relations with the State of Palestine. \r\nFurthermore, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania \r\nand Switzerland have decided to give the Palestinian \r\ndelegations in their countries the status of embassies or \r\na similar entity.\r\nJust a few days ago, we bore witness to a \r\nhistoric moment in the General Assembly, when the \r\nrepresentative of the State of Palestine participated for \r\nthe first time in an election in this organ (see A/68/\r\nPV.53). Cuba congratulates the Government and the \r\npeople of Palestine for that event, which is a new \r\nstep towards what should be the final objective, that \r\nis, the participation of the State of Palestine as a full \r\nMember of the United Nations. Cuba will continue \r\nto support the Palestinian people in their legitimate \r\nstruggle for justice, peace, dignity and the right to self-\r\ndetermination. We also reiterate our desire for peace \r\nfor the rest of the peoples of the Middle East.\r\nMr. Waheed (Maldives): Last week, the State of \r\nPalestine cast its first ballot in a General Assembly \r\nelection (see A/68/PV.53). It was a symbolic step \r\nby a nation determined to become a full Member of \r\nthe Organization. It was one step of many towards \r\nrecognition. No matter how long it takes or how \r\ndifficult the path, the Republic of the Maldives will \r\nwalk shoulder to shoulder with our Palestinian brothers \r\nand sisters. The vast majority of the United Nations \r\nmembership supports Palestine in that journey. The \r\nwork of the Organization will continue to support the \r\naspirations of its people, as manifested today in the \r\n13-57987 19/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nday ... Israeli settlers in the West Bank consume \r\napproximately six times the water consumed by \r\nPalestinians” (A/68/35, para. 37).\r\nThe expansion of settlements is detrimental to the \r\npeace process and undermines the basis for a future \r\nPalestinian State. Yet the Government of Israel has \r\napproved the construction of approximately 24,000 \r\nresidential units in the occupied territories and has \r\nretroactively legalized others. Under international \r\nlaw, settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including that in East Jerusalem, is illegal. \r\nThe Government of Israel, however, continues to issue \r\nconstruction tenders for housing units that will stop the \r\ndevelopment of the Palestinian people. Furthermore, \r\nthey refuse to act when illegal construction takes place \r\non the private property of Palestinians. The Republic \r\nof the Maldives strongly condemns those actions. \r\nWe furthermore condemn the unjust demolition and \r\nevictions that took place in Area C and resulted in \r\nthe displacement of some 907 individuals, including \r\n458 children. In the interests of pursuing meaningful \r\nnegotiations and a lasting peace, it is up to the \r\noccupying Power to cease all illegal activity in the \r\noccupied territories.\r\nThe Maldives commends the efforts made by the \r\nPalestinians to advance their State-building programme \r\ndespite the serious budget deficits and restrictions \r\nimposed by the occupying Power. The Maldives \r\nbelieves unequivocally in the need for an independent, \r\nfree and sovereign Palestinian State. We also believe in \r\nthe right of Israel to security, safety and peace. It is the \r\noccupation that is the problem for both nations. It is the \r\noccupation that perpetuates hatred, fear and violence. \r\nWe, the States Members of the United Nations, beat \r\nthis drum year after year, and we make little progress. \r\nThe ancestors of those two nations built the pyramids \r\nin less time than we have taken to find a just and lasting \r\nsolution to this question. Generations have lived under \r\noppression and fear. It is our hope that this is the last \r\ngeneration — the one that will see the end of this \r\njourney.\r\nMrs. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): On the occasion of the International Day \r\nof Solidarity with the Palestinian People, I would first \r\nlike to emphasize a message from His Highness Sheikh \r\nKhalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United \r\nArab Emirates, to the Chair of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, regarding the firm position of the Government \r\nand achieving a just and agreed solution to the Palestine \r\nrefugee issue on the basis of resolution 194 (III).\r\nThe unfortunate reality, however, is that a \r\ncomprehensive solution is still years away. We believe \r\nin a two-State solution, but expert after expert has told \r\nus at the United Nations that the window for such a \r\nsolution is closing. It is being closed by new settlements \r\nchanging the demographics of Palestine. It is being \r\nclosed by an economic embargo meant to leave a people \r\ndestitute. It is also being closed by a refusal to grant \r\nPalestinians access to Palestinian land.\r\nDiscriminatory practices by the occupying Power \r\nhave had a devastating impact on the most vulnerable \r\nand have had dire impacts on social and economic \r\nsectors, as well as on Palestine’s natural resources and \r\nits environment. The 1993 Oslo Accords stipulated that \r\narea C of the West Bank was to be transferred to the \r\nPalestinian Authority by 1998. That has not happened. \r\nThe World Bank released a report last month that attests \r\nthat the refusal is costing the Palestinian economy \r\n$3.4 billion.\r\nThe occupation is one that inherently leads \r\nPalestine to being poor and dependent on foreign \r\naid. The occupation makes it a breeding ground for \r\nextremism. The occupation also stands in the way of \r\nevery measure that would afford them an ounce of \r\ndignity, and it is perpetuating a cycle of oppression that \r\nhas already lasted generations.\r\nThere has to be a way forward. There has to \r\nbe compromise. Despite the advisory opinion of \r\nthe International Court of Justice on 9 July 2004 \r\n(A/ES-10/273), the occupying Power continues with the \r\nillegal construction of the wall in the occupied West \r\nBank and around occupied Jerusalem. The wall is \r\nestimated to be twice the length of the 1949 armistice \r\ndemarcation line and would isolate and entrap 11,000 \r\nPalestinians, who would then be dependent on the \r\noccupying Power granting them permits to them to live \r\nin their own homes.\r\nUnderground and surface water resources are \r\nalmost exclusively controlled by the occupying Power. \r\nThe report of the Committee states that\r\n“approximately 1 million Palestinians in 492 \r\ncommunities in the West Bank access or consume \r\n60 litres of water per capita per day or less, \r\nsignificantly below the World Health Organization \r\nrecommendation of 100 litres per capita per \r\n20/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nand concrete measures to force Israel to immediately \r\ncease all its illegal settlement activities.\r\nThe economic and social conditions in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories have deteriorated severely owing \r\non the one hand to ongoing Israeli practices and on \r\nthe other to the Palestinian Authority’s inadequate \r\nresources. We hope that donors will provide more \r\nemergency aid to the Palestinian people and continue \r\ntheir development assistance contributions in a timely \r\nmanner, in order to enable the Palestinian Authority to \r\novercome its current financial crisis and alleviate the \r\nnegative effects of the occupation.\r\nIn closing, my delegation, which is a sponsor of the \r\nfour draft resolutions (A/68/L.12, A/68/L.13, A/68/L.14 \r\nand A/68/L.15) under this agenda item in the General \r\nAssembly, believes that a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace in the Middle East is the only strategic \r\noption for countries that support peace and stability in \r\nthe region. That cannot be achieved without addressing \r\nthe root causes of the Arab-Israeli conflict, including \r\nIsrael’s withdrawal to the pre-June 1967 borders, and \r\nthe establishment of an independent Palestinian State \r\nwith full sovereignty and East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to take the opportunity afforded by the \r\nforthcoming International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People to reiterate Bahrain’s support and \r\nbacking for the Palestinian people in their just journey \r\ntowards recovering their inalienable rights and creating \r\nan independent State on their national territory with \r\nJerusalem as its capital, so they can be like all other \r\npeoples.\r\nIn this context, His Majesty King Hamad bin Issa \r\nAl Khalifa of Bahrain has sent a letter to the Committee \r\non the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People in which he urges the international \r\ncommunity to remain vigilant and to monitor the \r\nsituation carefully so as to bring an end to all activities \r\nresulting from Israeli practices that might impede or \r\nhamper negotiations — to the illegal settlement activity \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories, especially \r\nJerusalem; to the repeated Israeli attacks on religious \r\nsites, especially the Al-Aqsa Mosque; and to the unjust \r\nblockade of Gaza. It is also important that negotiations \r\nensure that all religious sites are treated equally. His \r\nMajesty also noted that it is a propitious time to achieve \r\na just and lasting peace.\r\nand people of the United Arab Emirates on supporting \r\nthe State of Palestine until its territories and all its \r\nlegitimate rights, including the right of return and self-\r\ndetermination, are fully restored, and it is established \r\nas an independent State with Jerusalem as its capital. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation and continued support for the Committee \r\nand its efforts to advance the Palestinian cause and \r\npromote a peaceful solution to all the aspects of the \r\nissue, in accordance with the decisions of international \r\nlaw.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Palestinian delegation’s \r\nparticipation, for the first time since the establishment \r\nof the United Nations, in a vote in a General Assembly \r\nelection (see A/68/PV.53). We regard it as a significant \r\nand historic step and look forward to its culmination \r\nsoon in international recognition of Palestine as a full \r\nMember and independent State of the United Nations, \r\nlike all others.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly supports all \r\nthe positive regional and international political efforts \r\nthat for decades have attempted to achieve a peaceful, \r\nfair settlement of the Palestinian question, including \r\nthose made recently by the United States, leading \r\nthree months ago to the resumption of direct political \r\nnegotiations between the Palestinian and Israeli sides \r\nwith a view to reaching a final peace agreement settling \r\nall the core issues. In that connection, my delegation \r\nemphasizes the essential role played by the United States \r\nin resuming negotiations. However, if negotiations fail \r\nwe cannot go back to square one.\r\nWe also emphasize the importance of the \r\ncommitment on the part of Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to lifting the unjust siege imposed on the Gaza \r\nStrip, releasing thousands of Palestinian detainees and \r\nwithdrawing from all occupied Palestinian territories. \r\nThat is a prerequisite for creating an environment \r\nconducive to continuing the negotiations and reaching, \r\nwithin the nine-month deadline, an acceptable peace \r\nagreement based on a two-State solution and peaceful \r\ncoexistence and that complies with the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and the \r\nagreed principles of the peace process. We strongly \r\ncondemn Israel’s ongoing settlement activities, and \r\nhold the Israeli Government responsible for the current \r\nbreakdown in negotiations and other efforts aimed at \r\nachieving a just settlement of the issue. Now more than \r\never, we urge the international community, especially \r\nthe Quartet and the Security Council, to take serious \r\n13-57987 21/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nrespect for the road map, the principle of land for peace, \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative. The International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People closely reflects \r\nthe aspirations and the feelings of the international \r\ncommunity towards the brotherly Palestinian people.\r\nMr. Masood Kahn (Pakistan): Resolution 67/19, \r\nadopted last year, is a landmark in the struggle of \r\nthe Palestinian people to realize their right to self-\r\ndetermination. The resolution sparked the dream that \r\nan independent State of Palestine would soon emerge \r\non the map of the world. Today we express once again \r\nour solidarity with the Palestinian people.\r\nEarlier this year, hopes for a State of Palestine were \r\nrevived with the reactivation of the peace process. In \r\nthat regard, we pay tribute to the United States Secretary \r\nof State, Mr. John Kerry, whose persistent and resolute \r\ndiplomacy brought the Palestinian Authority and the \r\nIsraeli Government back to the negotiating table. What \r\nwe have seen in the past five months is that the dialogue \r\nbetween the two sides is fragile. Despite that, we must \r\nnot lose hope. The talks should not break down. We \r\nunderstand and respect the vow of secrecy between \r\nthe sides on the sensitive and difficult negotiations \r\nthey are conducting. Public signs about those talks \r\nare, however, not very encouraging. The resignations \r\nof the Palestinian negotiators point to serious problems \r\nbehind closed doors.\r\nThere are four obstacles to the success of the \r\nnegotiations that must be removed.\r\nFirst, the two sides, the people of Israel and \r\nPalestine, and not just their official representatives, \r\nshould believe in and support a two-State solution. \r\nTwo independent States, Palestine and Israel, with their \r\nborder drawn as it existed before the 1967 war, should \r\nplan to live side by side in peace and security. East \r\nJerusalem, Al-Quds Al-Sharif, will be the Palestinian \r\nState’s capital.\r\nA two-State solution is the best solution on the \r\ntable. All others — a binational State or a unitary, \r\nsingular State —are mirages that would further fracture \r\nthe two States and shatter all hopes for peace. The \r\nvision of the two-State solution should be owned and \r\nbacked by multiple religious communities and secular \r\nconstituencies on both sides. To that end, the leaders \r\non both sides have to inspire and instil confidence. \r\nPalestine and Israel must heed Secretary Kerry’s call \r\nfor a sense of urgency, because if no progress is made in \r\nthe nine-month talks, the window of opportunity will \r\nThe international community should therefore step \r\nup its efforts to make the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations \r\na success, and we hope that we will be able through \r\nnegotiations to rapidly put an end to the conflict. We \r\nhave no doubt that the creation of an independent \r\nPalestinian State that is lasting and viable, living \r\nside by side with Israel, within safe and recognized \r\nborders, is an urgent matter and can be achieved. \r\nThat is especially true following the adoption by an \r\noverwhelming majority of resolution 67/19, granting \r\nPalestine the status of non-member observer State in a \r\nmark of support for the struggle of the brave Palestinian \r\npeople. His Majesty the King has also stated that those \r\nare feasible and legitimate aspirations insofar as the \r\nUnited Nations is working for a just and lasting peace \r\nwith the support of all its Member States, and that we \r\nwill achieve our objective through the creation of two \r\nStates living side by side in peace and cooperation with \r\neach other.\r\nWe thank Ambassador Diallo, Chair of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People, and all members of the \r\nCommittee for their diligent and praiseworthy efforts \r\nto draft the report before us (A/68/363). We highly \r\nappreciate their efforts to enable the Palestinian people \r\nto exercise their inalienable rights, as recognized by \r\nthe General Assembly in 1974. The Security Council \r\nresolutions of 1967 also recognized the inalienable \r\nrights of the Palestinian people and all Arabs in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories.\r\nWe would also like to thank the Chair for raising the \r\nawareness of the international community with regard \r\nto the suffering and needs of the Palestinian people, \r\nand for all media activity within the framework of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, including the awareness-raising \r\nand training programme for Palestinian journalists \r\nheld last year, which shed light on various aspects \r\nof developments and progress related to the issue of \r\nPalestine and the Middle East peace process.\r\nThe report before us contains detailed information \r\nthat reflects the deterioration of the situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. That deterioration is \r\nongoing, day after day, and includes constraints and \r\nlimitations on the freedom of movement, closures, the \r\nblockade of Gaza, and the continued building of the wall \r\nof separation by Israel. A just, comprehensive and lasting \r\npeace is a strategic option that will require the adoption \r\nof United Nations resolutions and the implementation \r\nof all relevant documents and resolutions, including \r\n22/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nterritories. The Quartet should also become more active \r\nin supporting the peace process. Pakistan believes that \r\nthe resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, including \r\nthrough the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese \r\nterritories and the Syrian Golan, is the only guarantee \r\nof sustainable peace in the region.\r\nThe Palestinian Authority undertook the ambitious \r\ntask of building infrastructure and institutions for the \r\nfuture Palestinian State three years ago. They have made \r\nconsiderable progress towards achieving that objective, \r\nbut there is still a long way to go. The international \r\ncommunity must step forward to help the Palestinians \r\nmore vigorously in that endeavour.\r\nPalestine sits at the United Nations today as a State \r\nand was able to vote in the General Assembly for the \r\nfirst time last week (see A/68/PV.53). This is a reality \r\nthat must be recognized by all. There is no alternative. \r\nThe sooner this realization sinks in, the less will be the \r\nsuffering on all sides and the better it will be for the \r\npeace and stability of the region.\r\nMr. Al-Naama (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset to thank President Ashe for having \r\nconvened this meeting and to extend my thanks to the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People for its efforts to ease the suffering \r\nof the Palestinian people and to ensure that all of their \r\nrights are restored. I pay tribute to the important role \r\nplayed by the Division for Palestinian Rights for its \r\nefforts to that end.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Tunisia on behalf of the Arab Group \r\nand of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nThis year, we are celebrating the first anniversary \r\nof the historic decision of the General Assembly to \r\ngrant the State of Palestine the status of non-member \r\nobserver State. That historic decision repaired a great \r\ninjustice done to the Palestinian people. It was also \r\nin keeping with the ultimate objective of creating a \r\nPalestinian State within the pre-1967 borders, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, in order to restore the rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people and work for lasting peace in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nWe have always stated that the only viable solution \r\nis a two-State solution on the basis of the Madrid terms \r\nof reference, the concept of land for peace, the road \r\nmap and the Arab Peace Initiative. The achievement of \r\nstart to close and the peace process will plunge back \r\ninto free fall and uncertainty.\r\nSecondly, Israel must roll back its plans for \r\nexpanding illegal settlements. The Secretary-General, \r\nin his report entitled “Peaceful settlement of the question \r\nof Palestine” (A/68/363), maintains that settlements are \r\nillegal under international law and has warned that the \r\nsituation on the ground presents a growing cause of \r\nconcern over the viability of a two-State solution. Israel \r\nknows that those settlements are the single biggest \r\nimpediment to peace talks. Yet on 3 November, it chose \r\nto announce plans for over 1,700 units, followed by \r\nplans for the construction of another 20,000 units in the \r\nWest Bank, including in the E-1 area.\r\nThat frantic surge in settlements should be halted \r\nto give the talks a chance to succeed. In that regard, \r\nwe urge the United States to use its special relationship \r\nand influence with Israel. That is also necessary \r\nto prevent the Palestinian State from turning into \r\ndisjointed enclaves. The new Palestinian State must \r\nhave a geographically viable, contiguous territory. We \r\nwelcome the release of Palestinian prisoners by Israel, \r\nbut regret that the impact of that gesture has been \r\nneutralized by the announcement of new settlements.\r\nThirdly, dispossessions in the occupied territory, \r\nespecially in East Jerusalem, must be stopped. The \r\nreport of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People (A/68/35) \r\nregisters a significant increase in demolitions and \r\ndisplacements. The number of people displaced from \r\nEast Jerusalem in the first eight months of 2013 was \r\nmore than the combined total for 2011 and 2012. Media \r\nreports suggest that while the number of settlers is \r\ngrowing, thousands of Palestinians are being forced to \r\nleave Jerusalem.\r\nFourthly, in Gaza the collective punishment meted \r\nout to the Palestinians continued into its seventh year. \r\nAn average of fewer than 200 people were allowed out \r\nof Gaza per day in the first half of 2013, compared to \r\naround 26,000 in the same period before the blockade. \r\nNineteen out of 20 projects of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East have ground to a halt due to the shortage of \r\nconstruction materials.\r\nThe international community should not remain \r\nsilent while Palestine continues to disappear before our \r\neyes. We appreciate the European Union guidelines \r\non the funding of projects in the occupied Palestinian \r\n13-57987 23/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nQatar underscores that Israel’s occupation of \r\nthe Syrian Golan is a threat to peace and security \r\nthroughout the region and a violation of international \r\nlaw and decisions of international legitimacy. Israel’s \r\nattempts to annex the Syrian Golan are null and void. \r\nWe condemn the illegal Israeli practices seeking to \r\nappropriate natural resources in the area, including \r\nwater resources.\r\nIn conclusion, on the occasion of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, I express \r\nour full solidarity with the Palestinian people and their \r\nGovernment in their struggle to put an end to foreign \r\noccupation and recover their inalienable rights. Qatar \r\nwill continue to provide aid and assistance to the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people until their inalienable \r\nrights have been restored.\r\nMr. Dabbashi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): About a \r\nyear ago, in a historic gesture, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 67/19, whereby it acknowledged the \r\nexistence of the State of Palestine, which was accepted \r\nas a non-member observer State in the United Nations. \r\nWith that step, the international community affirmed its \r\nresolve to move towards responding to the aspirations \r\nof the Palestinian people and the achievement of their \r\ndream of establishing their own independent sovereign \r\nState over their entire territory.\r\nHowever, the General Assembly resolution was \r\nsoon met by arbitrary, provocative actions by the Israeli \r\nauthorities, including the pursuit of new, aggressive \r\nsettlement policies to build thousands of residential \r\nunits within the occupied Palestinian territories with \r\nthe aim of placing more new Jewish immigrants on the \r\nPalestinian land that is still in the hands of Palestinians \r\nand of undermining the possibility of the establishment \r\nof any form of a Palestinian State on less than 20 per \r\ncent of the historical land of Palestine. That was borne \r\nout by the 355 per cent increase in settlement activities \r\nduring the first quarter of this year compared with the \r\nsame period last year.\r\nDespite broad international condemnation of the \r\nIsraeli settlement policy and the continuous affirmation \r\nby the United Nations of Israel’s breaches of international \r\nlaw, the Israeli occupation authorities have persisted \r\nin their arrogance, illegitimate practices, violations \r\nof international law and refusal to acknowledge the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinian people. The \r\nPalestinian people have been oppressed for decades \r\nthrough the usurpation of their territory and their \r\nthat objective, unfortunately, is hampered by Israel’s \r\nstrategy of fait accompli, occupation, use of brutal \r\nforce and rejection of the option of peace and of the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State, and by its continuing \r\nillegal settlement activities in the occupied territories, \r\nin addition to the statements made by its representatives \r\nrejecting the concept of a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace on the basis of the relevant decisions of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIsrael continues to violate international law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law, as is quite clear from \r\nsuch international documents as the report of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People (A/68/35). Palestinians, including \r\nwomen and children, continue to be detained in Israeli \r\nprisons and detention centres, buildings continue to \r\nbe bulldozed, the separation wall keeps growing, and \r\nthe violence against the Palestinian people continues \r\nunabated. We are especially concerned by the Israeli \r\nGovernment’s strategy of sabotaging the Palestinian \r\neconomy and depriving the Palestinian people of access \r\nto water. Qatar rejects and condemns any attempt to \r\njudaize Jerusalem and to desecrate holy sites, Muslim \r\nor Christian, including attacks on the holy Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque and the excavation work being carried out \r\nbeneath it. We urge the United Nations and all other \r\nrelevant international organizations to ensure that the \r\nnational and Arab character of Jerusalem is respected.\r\nThe unfair blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza \r\ncontinues, despite the deterioration of the humanitarian \r\nand economic situation there. Building materials, for \r\nexample, have been prohibited from being imported \r\ninto the territory, despite the calls of the United Nations \r\nto lift that prohibition. The electricity supply in Gaza \r\nis unreliable, which undermines basic living conditions \r\nthere.\r\nThe deterioration of Palestinian living conditions in \r\nthe occupied territories, in particular Gaza, the ongoing \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian diaspora, the repression by \r\nthe occupying forces, the repeated military aggression \r\nagainst the Palestinian people and violations of \r\ninternational law by the occupying Power remind us \r\ntoday of the need to lend our support to the Palestinian \r\npeople whenever possible. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to work for a lasting, comprehensive and \r\njust peace and to support the Palestinian movement \r\ntowards the creation of a Palestinian State, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, that includes all the territory \r\noccupied since 1967.\r\n24/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nPalestinians from the territories that were occupied \r\nin 1948 and the establishment of a so-called greater \r\nIsrael as envisaged by the leaders of the racist Zionist \r\nmovement and the Israeli religious extremists, with \r\nthe displacement of Palestinians from the remaining \r\nPalestinian territory.\r\nWe have heard the representative of Israel refuse to \r\ntell the story of the past century but instead invoke the \r\nhistory of the past 3,000 years. He does not want to know \r\nthat the number of Jews in historical Palestine in 1917 \r\nwas no more than 7 per cent of the population, and that \r\nin 1947 their number — despite the Balfour Declaration, \r\nwhich gave land to those who did not deserve it — was \r\nno more than 36 per cent of the population of historical \r\nPalestine. They do not want to acknowledge those facts, \r\nand they always say that the whole of Palestine belongs \r\nto the Israeli Jews, who have come from every corner \r\nof the world and have displaced the indigenous owners, \r\nwho are the Palestinians.\r\nIsrael’s continued intransigence, its rejection of all \r\nattempts at settlement and its continued construction of \r\nnew settlements in the Palestinian territories will lead \r\nonly to further bloodshed and will block international \r\ninitiatives to establish peace in the region. It is \r\nincumbent on the Security Council and the international \r\ncommunity to alter the way they deal with Israel. They \r\nshould see to it that the Palestinian people have their \r\nown independent State. If peace is to endure in the \r\nregion, it will be achieved only by supporting the efforts \r\nof the State of Palestine to obtain full membership in \r\nall international organizations. I say that peace will not \r\nbe achieved except through support for the efforts of \r\nthe State of Palestine to obtain full membership in all \r\ninternational organizations, as it has in UNESCO, and \r\nthrough the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces \r\nfrom all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, \r\nincluding the occupied Syrian Golan and the Lebanese \r\nShaba’a Farms.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): At the outset, I would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation to the President for convening \r\nthis important discussion in the General Assembly on \r\nthe question of Palestine.\r\nWe are marking the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People. Let me begin, therefore, \r\nby quoting from the message of my Prime Minister, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Manmohan Singh, to the friendly \r\npeople of Palestine on this occasion.\r\ndispersal throughout the world. Palestinian suffering \r\nincreases every day. Zionist settlers — armed to the \r\nteeth, shielded by impunity and not held accountable by \r\nany authority — perpetrate daily actions of aggression \r\nagainst the actual owners of the land, who are the \r\nPalestinians. Instead, they are encouraged by the Israeli \r\noccupation forces to persist in such barbaric practices, \r\nwhich have inflicted gross damage on people, land and \r\nproperty.\r\nThe Israeli occupation authorities seek to depopulate \r\nPalestinian territories through detention, intimidation, \r\nthe demolition of homes and displacement, especially \r\nin East Jerusalem, which has been subjected to a fierce \r\ncampaign of Judaization and demographic manipulation. \r\nIn blatant violation of the most basic human rights \r\nand principles of international law, including the \r\nGeneva Conventions, the Israeli occupation authorities \r\nhave imposed an embargo on more than 1.5 million \r\nPalestinians in the largest prison on the face of the \r\nEarth, the so-called Gaza Strip. I do not think I need \r\nto recall the details of the various atrocities perpetrated \r\nby the Israeli occupation authorities, because they are \r\npractices carried out every day in full view of all and \r\nalways present in our memory.\r\nThe question of Palestine is the only issue that \r\nis as old as the United Nations. Yet unlike all other \r\ninternational questions, it has remained without a \r\nsolution or even the prospect of one. That is due to \r\nthe failure to implement the relevant resolutions of the \r\nOrganization, because Israel is treated as a State above \r\nthe law. It acts on that basis and always finds those to \r\nprotect it, at the expense of the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. Israel has never wanted to achieve a peace \r\nagreement with the Palestinians that would allow the \r\nPalestinians to exercise self-determination and establish \r\na sovereign, independent State. Therefore, since 1993, \r\nIsrael has consistently used the so-called peace process \r\nto buy time to further assimilate Palestinian territories, \r\nrendering the establishment of a viable Palestinian \r\nState impossible. That is the current status quo, with \r\nsettlements metastasizing like cancer in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories.\r\nI do not know what will be achieved by the \r\nPalestinian-Israeli talks if the Israelis have never \r\nofficially recognized an inch of the land of Palestine \r\nas occupied Palestinian territory. They also call on the \r\nPalestinians to recognize Israel as a State for the Jewish \r\npeople, without defining the borders of such a State. \r\nThat clearly means the expulsion of the remaining \r\n13-57987 25/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nThe resolution of the Palestinian question is a \r\nprerequisite for building a sustainable and lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East region. Given the fragile \r\nand unpredictable situation in the Middle East with \r\nthe ongoing conflict in Syria, there should be no more \r\ndelay in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian issue. The \r\nsituation in the occupied Palestinian territories has \r\nbeen deteriorating, due to settlement activities in the \r\nWest Bank and East Jerusalem. Those activities are \r\ncreating new realities on the ground, threatening the \r\nvery premise of a two-State solution. The blockade of \r\nGaza has also had serious consequences for the lives \r\nof Palestinians. It has adversely affected essential \r\nservices, economic activities and infrastructure \r\ndevelopment. The Palestinian Authority is also facing \r\na severe financial crisis that could erode the significant \r\nprogress it has made in building State institutions.\r\nAll those issues must be addressed in a timely \r\nmanner if a just and durable peace in the region is \r\nto be achieved. While there has been improvement \r\nin restrictions on the West Bank and movement of \r\nhumanitarian supplies and construction material into \r\nGaza, we continue to hold that it is necessary for Israel \r\nto lift the blockade on Gaza and allow the normal and \r\nunrestricted movement of persons and goods within \r\nPalestine. We also join others in urging Israel to stop \r\nsettlement activities.\r\nIndia has a long history of solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people. As it has demonstrated over the \r\npast six decades, including during its memberships in \r\nthe Security Council, India also stands ready to support \r\nall measures that the Palestinian leadership may take \r\ntowards political resolution of the final-status issues. In \r\nconclusion, I would like to reiterate India’s continued \r\nsupport for the Palestinian cause.\r\nMr. Kommasith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): My delegation endorses the statement made \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nLast Monday, 18 November, in this very Hall, we \r\nwitnessed a historic first vote by the State of Palestine \r\nin the General Assembly of the United Nations in \r\nthe election of a judge to the Residual Mechanism of \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the former \r\nYugoslavia (see A/68/PV.53), and I congratulate the \r\nPalestinian people on that auspicious occasion.\r\nAs many of us have said today, making progress \r\nin that direction is a critical issue of global justice and \r\n“On the occasion of the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People, I reaffirm \r\nIndia’s strong and steadfast support for the \r\nPalestinian cause. We welcome the recent efforts \r\nof Palestine and Israel, mediated by the United \r\nStates, for resumption of direct peace talks, and \r\nremain hopeful that the negotiations will lead \r\nto a comprehensive peace process for the final \r\nresolution of the conflict within an agreed timeline. \r\nIndia supports a negotiated resolution, resulting in \r\na sovereign, independent, viable and united State of \r\nPalestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, living \r\nwithin secure and recognized borders, side by side \r\nand at peace with Israel, as endorsed in the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative, the Quartet road map and relevant \r\nUnited Nations Security Council resolutions.\r\n“I also take this opportunity to extend heartiest \r\ncongratulations to the people of Palestine and their \r\nleadership on obtaining non-member observer State \r\nstatus in the United Nations General Assembly last \r\nyear. India has always played a proactive role in \r\nsupporting the Palestinian cause in multilateral \r\nforums. We sponsored the resolution enhancing \r\nPalestine’s status in the General Assembly and \r\nwill continue to support Palestine’s bid for full and \r\nequal membership of the United Nations.\r\n“India has also supported the nation-building \r\nefforts of Palestine through technical and \r\neconomic assistance, including budgetary support. \r\nWe are supporting the construction of schools \r\nand setting up an information technology centre \r\nand vocational training centre in Palestine. \r\nAdditionally, India contributes $1 million annually \r\nto the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East. We are also \r\nimplementing development projects in Palestine \r\njointly with Brazil and South Africa as partners in \r\nIBSA. India will continue to support those efforts.\r\n“On this important occasion, on behalf of \r\nthe people of India, I convey our best wishes and \r\ngreetings to the friendly people of Palestine.”\r\nIt has been almost a year since the Assembly voted \r\nto upgrade Palestine’s status in the United Nations to \r\nthat of non-Member observer State (resolution 67/19), \r\nalong with other resolutions that are voted on every \r\nyear. While that was an important milestone, the \r\naspirations of the Palestinian people and leadership to \r\nfull membership of the United Nations still remain to \r\nbe achieved.\r\n26/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nattaining the long-delayed goal of a viable, peaceful \r\nand prosperous State of Palestine that is a full-f ledged \r\nMember of the United Nations. I take this opportunity \r\nto commend the role played and work done by United \r\nNations agencies, especially the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast, to assist millions of Palestinians in need during \r\nall these years amid multiple difficulties. We also \r\nwish the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People every success in its \r\nnoble endeavour for a peaceful, just, comprehensive \r\nand lasting solution to the question of Palestine.\r\nMrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe Government of Reconciliation and National \r\nUnity of Nicaragua wishes to take the opportunity \r\nafforded by this debate on the question of Palestine to \r\nsalute the heroic Palestinian people and their authorities \r\non this International Day of Solidarity. We reaffirm our \r\nsolidarity and support for their just struggle to establish \r\na sovereign and independent Palestinian State. \r\nWe find ourselves at this debate almost a year \r\nafter the adoption of historic resolution 67/19, in \r\nwhich, together with the rest of the international \r\ncommunity, we renew our solidarity with the cause of \r\nthe Palestinian people and, at the same time, our hopes \r\nfor, and commitment to, the search for a solution to the \r\nproblem of Palestine, which is the core of the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict, and the need to achieve a just, complete \r\nand lasting peace.\r\nThe greatest desire of the Palestinian people is to \r\nfind peace and to live in harmony with its neighbours \r\nin a free, independent and viable State. However, that \r\ncannot be achieved as long as the Israeli occupation and \r\nits aggression continue and as long as the Palestinian \r\npeople, who have struggled heroically to resist \r\nunder very difficult conditions, cannot redeem their \r\nlegitimate ancestral rights, recover their occupied land, \r\nor experience the return of refugees, the release of \r\nprisoners, the lifting of the blockade, and the rights to \r\nwater and to live freely within their own borders.\r\nNicaragua is concerned about the stalemate in the \r\npeace negotiations, which has lasted for months. Israel \r\ncontinues to construct more settlements in the occupied \r\nterritories, especially in East Jerusalem. Putting an \r\nend to the construction of those illegal settlements \r\na defining test of this Organization. Member States \r\nmust therefore work further to enable Palestinians to \r\nrealize their inalienable rights, including the rights of \r\nreturn and self-determination, as well as their earnest \r\naspirations to freedom, prosperity, peace and justice \r\nin an independent sovereign State of Palestine, based \r\non the pre-1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital.\r\nWe must acknowledge that the Palestinian people’s \r\nchanged United Nations status and right to be a \r\nrecognized State does not alter their firm commitment \r\nto resolving the conflict through dialogue and peaceful \r\nmeans. We are well aware of how they have suffered \r\nand struggled over the last several decades without a \r\nglimmer of hope, while the international community \r\nhas been unable to take decisive action at the level \r\nwhere it matters most. Over time, we can see the \r\ngrowing ability of the Palestinian Authority to establish \r\nthe institutional foundations essential for international \r\nrecognition of Palestinian statehood, as endorsed by all \r\nmajor international organizations and institutions. We \r\ncommend the Palestinians for that heroic effort, despite \r\nthe serious obstacles and challenges they confront.\r\nThe continued illegal settlement activity and \r\ndestruction of property, homes and businesses in the \r\noccupied territories have not only worsened the already \r\ncritical socioeconomic situation facing the Palestinian \r\npopulation, they also constitute a breach of international \r\nlaw, including international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law, as well as an obstacle to the peace process \r\nand opportunities for negotiation.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic wishes to \r\nsee a just, lasting, comprehensive and peaceful solution \r\nto the Palestinian-Israeli conflict under the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the Quartet road map, \r\nwhich envisage a sovereign, independent and viable \r\nState of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nliving side by side in peace and security with the Jewish \r\nState of Israel. We therefore strongly support the \r\nrenewed engagement of the United States of America, \r\nsupported by the Arab League follow-up committee \r\nand many world leaders, and call on the parties to live \r\nup to their commitments, negotiate in good faith and \r\nrefrain from steps that could jeopardize negotiations. \r\nWe should give negotiation a chance. Peace comes only \r\nthrough dialogue.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has long \r\nrecognized the State of Palestine, and I wish to reaffirm \r\nits consistent support to the Palestinian people in \r\n13-57987 27/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nof the Palestinian People, along with its people, will \r\ncontinue to support the just cause of the Palestinian \r\npeople as a point of principle. Together with the \r\nCommittee and the rest of the international community, \r\nwill intensify our efforts to seek a peaceful solution that \r\nwill lead to the creation of a Palestinian State as a way \r\nof achieving a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.\r\nMy delegation is a sponsor of all of the draft \r\nresolutions (A/68/L.12, A/68/L.13, A/68/L.14 and \r\nA/68/L.15) to be adopted today by the General \r\nAssembly, which aim at finding a solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine and to a just and lasting peace \r\nin the Middle East. We call upon members to join the \r\ninitiative to declare 2014 as the year of solidarity with \r\nPalestine, which should lead to Palestine’s entry as the \r\n194th State Member of the Organization.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): A few days from \r\ntoday, on 29 November, we will join the Palestinian \r\npeople in celebrating the first anniversary of their \r\nstatehood. Speaking on the day of the acceptance \r\nof Palestine as a non-member observer State of the \r\nAssembly last year (see A/67/PV.45), we expressed \r\nour disappointment that the Palestinian people were \r\nnot granted full membership in the Organization, as \r\nthey so deserved. Knowing full well the constraints \r\nfaced by the people of Palestine and the inaction of the \r\nSecurity Council on that important matter, we recorded \r\nthat historic achievement as a positive step towards \r\nthe full implementation of the much-awaited two-State \r\nsolution. Almost a year from that momentous occasion, \r\nthe status of Palestine has not changed.\r\nThe negotiations between the two parties are \r\nongoing, but the environment within which they are \r\nbeing held is far from being conducive. The reasons for \r\nthe stalemate in the negotiations are well known. They \r\ninclude the increasing expansion of old and the building \r\nof new settlements, the obliteration of Palestinian homes, \r\nthe blockade of Gaza; attacks on Palestinian holy sites, \r\nthe limitation of movement, and the confiscation of \r\nland. The settlement construction activities are perhaps \r\nthe most deleterious act of aggression, as they result in \r\nthe transfer of the Israeli population into the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, thereby limiting or thwarting \r\nthe possibility of creating two contiguous States. It is \r\nsaid that these activities have also led to the resignation \r\nof the Palestinian negotiation team as they feel that \r\nthese irresponsible activities undermine the spirit of \r\nnegotiations.\r\nis an indispensable prerequisite to committing to the \r\nnegotiations in good faith. We demand a halt to any \r\nfurther construction of settlements in the occupied \r\nterritories and to the ethnic cleansing being conducted \r\nby Israelis.\r\nIsrael must negotiate on the basis of the various \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. The international \r\ncommunity must redouble its efforts, especially those \r\nof its permanent member ally in the Security Council, \r\nso that Israel will put an end to its arbitrary behaviour \r\nand truly commit itself to negotiate in order to achieve \r\na new era of peace and stability in the Middle East.\r\nWe cannot waste this historic opportunity. It is \r\nenough to read the report of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (A/68/35), presented today, for the entire \r\ncommunity of nations to realize that the massive \r\nviolations of human rights and the economic, political, \r\nsocial and cultural rights of our Palestinian brothers \r\nand sisters are continuing.\r\nNicaragua believes it is important to adopt the \r\nnecessary confidence-building measures to drive \r\nforward effective negotiations by the parties, which \r\nwill make it possible to progress towards the ultimate \r\nachievement of a just peace based on the recognition \r\nand existence of two free and sovereign States. Our \r\nGovernment advocates a politically just solution to \r\nthe Palestinian problem on the basis of the various \r\nresolutions adopted by the United Nations, especially \r\nthose establishing the right of return of Palestinian \r\nrefugees and calling for Israel’s withdrawal from Arab \r\nterritories occupied in 1967, in accordance with the \r\nland-for-peace principle, established at the Madrid \r\nConference, and the Arab Peace Initiative, which would \r\nmake it possible to create a Palestinian State that is \r\nindependent, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWe welcome the release of 104 Palestinian political \r\nprisoners. But we also urge the release, as a show of \r\ngoodwill, of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners who \r\ncontinue to be incarcerated by Israel in an arbitrary \r\nmanner.\r\nNow more than ever and after the demonstration \r\nof support by an overwhelming majority of the \r\ninternational community for resolution 67/19, we have \r\nan opportunity to redress the injustice committed \r\nagainst these brotherly people. Nicaragua, as a newly \r\nelected member of the Coordinating Bureau of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\n28/29 13-57987\r\nA/68/PV.57 25/11/2013\r\nSeveral representatives have requested to take the \r\nf loor in exercise of the right of reply. I remind them that \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first intervention and to five minutes \r\nfor the second intervention and should be made by \r\nrepresentatives from their seats.\r\nMr. Roet (Israel): Today we heard a number of \r\nArab delegations liberally spreading condemnation \r\nand accusations. It would appear that those delegations \r\nare attempting to trample on the democratic process in \r\nthe General Assembly in the same way they trample \r\non the freedom of their own people. One would think \r\nthat their efforts would be better spent improving the \r\nhuman rights situation in their own backyards. These \r\ncynical attacks undermine the professional nature of \r\nthis forum. It is unfortunate that certain delegations \r\ninsist on politicizing and monopolizing the valuable \r\ntime of this body, as they have done throughout most \r\nof this discussion.\r\nMany have used this forum to launch a range \r\nof baseless accusations against my country, acting \r\nas cheerleaders for a Palestinian cause and thereby \r\ndistancing us from peace instead of assisting us in \r\nreaching it. It is truly absurd to hear some of the world’s \r\nmost oppressive tyrannies lecture the Middle East’s \r\nonly true democracy about human rights. One has to \r\nwonder what rights these representatives might be \r\nreferring to. Perhaps they mean religious rights, such as \r\nthose exercised by Libya, whose representative spoke \r\ntoday.\r\nLet me take the example of Libya. It is a tragedy \r\nthat after all of the international efforts to better the \r\nlives of the Libyan people and to free them from one of \r\nthe world’s worst dictators, its representative chose to \r\nuse the same rhetoric and language as in Al-Qadhafi’s \r\ntime, calling my country a racist Zionist movement \r\nand calling people and settlements, whether one likes \r\nthem or not, cancerous. If Libyans truly care about the \r\nsituation, I would advise them that a great deal of the \r\nweapons being wielded in my country and hampering \r\nthe peace process are coming from Libya. Perhaps \r\nthe Libyan authorities would be better off, instead of \r\nlecturing Israel, taking care of their own people. For the \r\nsake of the Israeli and Palestinian cause, perhaps they \r\ncould improve their border control.\r\nOne-sided, dogmatic and cheap propaganda is not \r\nproductive. Name-calling does not lead us towards real \r\npeace, but takes us farther away.\r\nWe all know that these egregious activities are a \r\nviolation of article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nand the relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \r\nAmazingly, all of this happens in full view of the \r\nmighty Security Council, but it continues to do nothing \r\nabout the situation. If Israel were negotiating in good \r\nfaith, it would have stopped its illegal practices and \r\nallowed a positive spirit to prevail during this critical \r\ntime. It is the responsibility of those who protect and \r\nhave influence over Israel to use their leverage over \r\nthe Israelis to abandon their obstructive behaviour and \r\nwork towards a peaceful and lasting solution. Clearly, \r\nIsrael is emboldened by the fact that it has influential \r\npartners who have the wherewithal to protect it, even as \r\nit plunges the region into even deeper chaos\r\nHaving said that, however, we welcome the positive \r\nrole played by such parties as the United States, the \r\nEuropean Union, the Quartet and the United Nations in \r\nmaking the negotiations a possibility. We hope that they \r\nwill be able to help the parties realize their noble goals \r\nand finally bring to a conclusion the protracted peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East.\r\nSouth Africa stresses the urgent need for Israel \r\nto lift the illegal blockade on Gaza, which entered its \r\nseventh year in June. The blockade continues to worsen \r\nthe already dire socioeconomic and humanitarian \r\nsituation in Gaza. We are disappointed that the measures \r\nthat were enacted by the Israeli Government in order \r\nto ease the implementation of the economic initiative \r\nfor Palestine, including approval for the importation of \r\ngreater quantities of construction materials and water \r\ninto Gaza, have now been suspended. We were hopeful \r\nthat those measures would continue to the revival \r\nof Gaza, which has suffered a great deal due to the \r\nblockade, which continues to frustrate the lives of its \r\ninhabitants and has contributed directly to the increase \r\nin unemployment and poverty. All of our hopes have \r\nonce again been dashed.\r\nIn conclusion, we welcome the decision to proclaim \r\n2014 the International Year of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity will exert all necessary efforts in 2014 \r\nto finally ensure the implementation of the two-State \r\nsolution and guarantee the inalienable right of the \r\nPalestinian people to self-determination. South Africa \r\nstands ready to contribute robustly to that effort.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this meeting.\r\n13-57987 29/29\r\n25/11/2013 A/68/PV.57\r\nForce (UNDOF) in the occupied Golan. That is \r\nprecisely what happened when armed groups, assisted \r\nby the occupying Power, received medical treatment in \r\nIsraeli hospitals and the staff and premises of UNDOF \r\nwere repeatedly kidnapped or attacked by these armed \r\ngroups.\r\nMr. Taguri (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): I thank you, \r\nSir, for giving me the f loor to speak in exercise of my \r\nright to reply. Like the representative who spoke before \r\nme, I did not want to take the f loor and further postpone \r\nthe adjournment of this meeting, but given what I have \r\nheard I feel forced to respond.\r\nWhat we and other Arab delegations have said \r\nregarding violations of human rights by Israel is not \r\nsomething that we invented. It is a reality documented \r\nby numerous reports of human rights entities and bodies \r\nand international organizations. We are here to consider \r\nthe Palestinian issue and the reports prepared by various \r\ninternational bodies dealing with the Palestinian \r\nquestion. All reaffirm exactly what has been said by the \r\nArab States regarding settlement policies, Palestinian \r\nprisoners and detainees, violations of human rights, \r\nviolations of the rights of the Palestinian people, and \r\nthe blockade of Gaza. All of those facts have been \r\ndocumented and cannot be denied. They are a simple \r\nreality, regardless of anything that might be said to the \r\ncontrary, especially by the Israeli representative.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension of the work of the \r\nSecond Committee. Members will recall that at its \r\n2nd plenary meeting, on 20 September, the General \r\nAssembly approved the recommendation of the General \r\nCommittee that the Second Committee should complete \r\nits work by Friday, 29 November. However, I have been \r\ninformed by the Chair of the Second Committee that the \r\nCommittee requests an extension of its work to Friday, \r\n6 December, as such an extension would facilitate \r\nreaching consensus on the pending draft resolutions \r\nbefore the Committee.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nextend the work of the Second Committee until Friday, \r\n6 December?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\nA few countries congratulated the Palestinian \r\ndelegation on having voted in the election for the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. I \r\nwould like to remind representatives that that vote \r\nhas nothing to do with attaining a Palestinian State. \r\nA Palestinian State can be achieved by negotiation. \r\nThe road to peace, for which we all pray, goes through \r\nRamallah and Jerusalem, and not via such discussions \r\nas heard here.\r\nI would not like to use the whole 10 minutes of time \r\nthat I am allocated, but simply refer to the member of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) who spoke here. \r\nWe heard many representatives of NAM criticize \r\nIsrael today. I would like to point out that these same \r\nrepresentatives chose to ignore the crimes of the State \r\nthat is the Chair of NAM, Iran. Some countries spoke of \r\ntheir honour in agreeing to the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of Iran. Iran is actively supporting a \r\nmurderous regime in Damascus and at the same time \r\nleading the chorus of attack in this Hall against Israel. \r\nThe rhetorical hypocrisy of NAM must stop. Countries \r\nthat care about the peace process should assist not only \r\nIsrael but primarily the Palestinians in making the \r\nright, proud and courageous choice of negotiating on \r\nthe ground instead of in the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Hamed (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I did not wish to take the f loor at this late \r\nhour. However, the lies and allegations submitted by \r\nthe representative of the Israeli occupation authorities \r\ndeserve a reply, albeit a very brief one. Israel, whose \r\nrepresentative boasted of its human rights record, is the \r\nlast State — and I reaffirm and underscore, the very last \r\nState — that has the right to invoke human rights, given \r\nthe tremendous and countless human rights violations \r\nit has committed since 1948 in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, the occupied Golan and Lebanon.\r\nThe representative of the Israeli occupation \r\nauthority said that Israel helps the Syrian people. At \r\nfirst I thought that I had misheard, but it seems that \r\nwhat I heard was true. If anything, it shows that the \r\nrepresentative of Israel is hallucinating wildly. The \r\nonly assistance provided by Israel is to armed terrorist \r\ngroups in the disengagement area in the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan. The Israeli representative acknowledged that \r\nin his statement today. Is such assistance to terrorist \r\ngroups, including Al-Qaida affiliates, not a violation of \r\ninternational law and the disengagement agreement? It \r\nendangers the United Nations Disengagement Observer \r\n"
