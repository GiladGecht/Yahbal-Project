"The meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 111\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/68/1)\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\ntaken at its 2nd plenary meeting, on 20 September \r\n2013, the General Assembly will hear a presentation by \r\nthe Secretary-General of his annual report on the work \r\nof the Organization, under agenda item 111. I give the \r\nf loor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Each year at this time, \r\nwe come together not to preserve the status quo but to \r\ndrive our world forward. This is an era of wondrous \r\nopportunity. Ours is the first generation that can wipe \r\npoverty from the face of the Earth, yet the pressures \r\non people and the planet are building — youth without \r\njobs, a warming climate, unresolved conflicts. Events \r\nare moving with the twenty-first century at a speed \r\noften outpacing the instituitions and systems designed \r\nfor another age. In streets and squares across the world, \r\npeople are pressing those in power. They want world \r\nleaders to listen. They want to know that we are doing \r\nall it takes to secure a life of dignity for all. \r\nFor more than a decade, the end of 2015 has been \r\nour long horizon. What once seemed a distant moment \r\nis now just around the corner. The year 2015 is the year \r\nby which we have pledged to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It is the year in which \r\nwe will adopt a new development agenda. And it is \r\nthe year the Assembly has agreed to complete a global \r\nagreement on climate change. The year 2015 is an \r\nhistoric opportunity. The MDGs have captured the \r\nimagination, generated remarkable gains and beat back \r\ndoubts about development itself. \r\nYet on some Goals, we are lagging badly. Inequality \r\nis growing. Too many people face exploitation, from \r\nfields to the factory f loor. While going further, a \r\nnew development agenda must be as inspiring as the \r\nMDGs. It must be universal, with ending poverty as \r\nits top priority, sustainable development at its core, \r\nand governance as its glue. It must find expression in a \r\nsingle set of goals. There should be no hierarchy among \r\nthe three dimensions of sustainable development, no \r\ndeferring the environment or social justice for later, \r\nonce economic growth is ensured. \r\nThe empowerment and rights of women must \r\nbe at the heart of everything we do. The equation is \r\nsimple: when girls are healthy and in school, when legal \r\nframeworks and financial access support women,when \r\nwomen’s lives are free of violence and discrimination, \r\nnations thrive. I add my voice to those of leaders who \r\nwill gather this afternoon to adopt a strong declaration \r\non sexual violence in conflict. Let the twenty-first \r\ncentury be the century of women.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nSuccess requires increased efforts on the part of \r\nthe private sector. Businesses must have elbow room \r\nto be able to do what they do best — create jobs and \r\ninnovate. But they must be ethical and responsible in \r\nconducting their activities, doing everything possible \r\nto protect the environment.\r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.5\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n5th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 24 September 2013, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Who among us can say \r\nthat they and their mothers and fathers are wrong to feel \r\nabandoned by the international community? We face a \r\nmoment of reckoning.\r\nThe Syrian Government must fully and quickly \r\nhonour the obligations it has assumed in acceding to \r\nthe Chemical Weapons Convention. The international \r\ncommunity must bring to justice the perpetrators of \r\nthe use of chemical weapons in Syria, a use that has \r\nbeen confirmed unequivocally by the United Nations \r\ninvestigation mission. The international community \r\nmust also, with equal determination, ensure the \r\nsafeguarding and destruction of Syria’s chemical \r\nweapons stockpiles and programmes. But we can hardly \r\nbe satisfied with destroying chemical weapons while \r\nthe wider war is still destroying all of Syria. The vast \r\nmajority of the killing and atrocities have been carried \r\nout with conventional weapons.\r\nI appeal to all States to stop fuelling the bloodshed \r\nand to end the arms f lows to all the parties. I look \r\nforward to the imminent adoption of an enforceable \r\nand binding Security Council resolution on chemical \r\nweapons. That should be followed immediately by \r\nhumanitarian action. United Nations human rights \r\nmonitors could play a useful role in reporting and \r\ndeterring further violations.\r\nI call on the Syrian Government and the opposition \r\nto uphold their obligations under international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law. They must lift \r\nall obstacles to humanitarian access and end the \r\nunconscionable targeting of medical facilities and \r\npersonnel. They must release the thousands of men, \r\nwomen and children whose detention has no basis \r\nin international law. Full accountability for serious \r\ninternational crimes is also vital, either through referral \r\nto the International Criminal Court or by other means \r\nconsistent with international law.\r\nThe response to the heinous use of chemical \r\nweapons has created diplomatic momentum, the first \r\nsigns of unity in far too long. Now we must build on that \r\nto get the parties to the negotiating table. I have been \r\nconsistently saying that military victory is an illusion. \r\nThe only answer is a political settlement. I appeal to the \r\nGovernment of Syria and the opposition, and I appeal to \r\nall those in the General Assembly Hall with influence \r\nover them, to make the Geneva II conference happen \r\nas soon as possible. It is time to end the killing and to \r\nreach the peace the Syrian people need and deserve.\r\nAt the Global Compact Leaders Summit held \r\nlast week, thousands of business leaders promised to \r\ntake additional measures so that their goals are better \r\naligned with the goals of the United Nations. The \r\nUnited Nations must devote more means to working not \r\njust with the world of business and finance, but also \r\nwith civil society and philanthropic organizations.\r\nThe effects of climate change threaten everything \r\nthat development has accomplished. The human and \r\neconomic consequences, which are becoming more \r\nsubstantial, affect everybody. The poorest and the \r\nmost vulnerable, who are the first to suffer and pay \r\nthe highest price, demand greater climate justice. \r\nThe message from the planet and from scientists is \r\nvery clear, as we will see again this week when the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change publishes \r\nits most recent assessment. \r\nThese dangers are accompanied by opportunities \r\nto be grasped: changing the way we function, our urban \r\nplanning, our means of transportation and the way in \r\nwhich our homes and our factories are supplied with \r\nenergy. The path of low carbon emissions is opening up \r\nbefore us — a path that can lead to the creation of jobs \r\nand to an improvement in public health, while allowing \r\nus all to protect the environment. \r\n(spoke in English) \r\nTo help set us on this course, I invite all here to a \r\nclimate summit meeting one year from now, September \r\nnext year, here at the United Nations. I challenge you to \r\nbring bold pledges to the summit. Innovate, scale up, \r\ncooperate and deliver concrete action that will close the \r\nemission gap and put us on track for an ambitious legal \r\nagreement through the process of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Let us \r\nseize the 2015 challenge — a final push for the MDGs, \r\nnew directions on energy and climate and an inspiring \r\nnew development framework. We must leave no one \r\nbehind.\r\nNow let me turn to the biggest peace and security \r\ncrisis in the world — the crisis in Syria. Well over \r\n100,000 people have been killed. Well over 7 million \r\npeople, a third of the total population, have f led their \r\nhomes. Families are under siege. Cities and towns lie \r\nin rubble. The economy is in ruins. Communities once \r\nalive with a blend of traditions and faiths have been torn \r\napart. The region is being dangerously destabilized. \r\nWe have seen the worst chemical weapons attack on \r\ncivilians in a quarter century. A lost generation of young \r\n13-48449 3/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nthe foundations of stability and coexistence. It is time \r\nfor us to more firmly commit ourselves to international \r\njustice and the International Criminal Court.\r\nI would like to launch a particular appeal on \r\nbehalf of the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of \r\nCambodia. They have achieved significant results, but \r\nthey constantly face serious financial difficulties that \r\ncurrently threaten to compromise their very existence. \r\nThe failure of the Chambers would be a tragedy for \r\nCambodians, who have awaited justice for a such a long \r\ntime. I urge the international community to release the \r\nnecessary resources to ensure that all the cases can be \r\ncompleted.\r\n(spoke in English) \r\nThe inability of Member States and the United \r\nNations to prevent and put a stop to large-scale human \r\nrights violations has had disastrous consequences. An \r\ninternal review of the United Nations action at the end \r\nof the war in Sri Lanka identified a systemic failure. \r\nMember States did not provide the United Nations \r\nsystem with support to meet the tasks they themselves \r\nhad set, and the system itself unfortunately did not \r\nadapt properly or deliver fully.\r\nIn this twentieth anniversary year of the Vienna \r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, we should renew \r\nour commitment to the United Nations founding \r\nprinciples. I intend to do more to help Member States \r\nreach early consensus to prevent large-scale violations \r\nand I am implementing recommendations to ensure that \r\nthe United Nations system upholds its responsibilities \r\nunder the Charter.\r\nThere will be little peace or enjoyment of human \r\nrights unless we confront a world awash in deadly \r\nweapons. The past year saw the promising adoption \r\nof the Arms Trade Treaty, finally regulating the \r\ninternational transfer of conventional weapons.\r\nBut nuclear disarmament is languishing. Deadly \r\nweapons are proliferating. The Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is still not in force. And small \r\narms continue to kill and maim. Meanwhile, at a time \r\nof pressing human need, spending on weapons remains \r\nabsurdly high. Let us get our priorities right and invest \r\nin people instead of wasting billions of dollars on \r\ndeadly weapons. \r\nThe leaders gathered here today are here to serve \r\n“we the peoples”. They can be the ones presiding over \r\nan end to poverty, giving voice to the will of the people \r\nLifting our sights from Syria, we can see \r\ntremendous stress and upheaval across the region. \r\nHistoric transitions have stumbled or slowed. \r\nSprings of inspiration are giving way to winters of \r\ndisillusionment. The challenges are immense: building \r\ndemocracy and pluralistic dialogue, dousing the f lames \r\nof sectarianism, filling the security vacuum after the \r\niron grip of dictators is gone. But the story is still being \r\nwritten. We must do our utmost to help those reforms \r\nsucceed. We must seize potential openings and respond \r\nto declarations of good will. Each nation will chart \r\nits own course. We cannot be complacent where there \r\nis backsliding, but must rather insist on respect for \r\nuniversal values, human rights, tolerance and political \r\ninclusion. These are the foundations of peace and \r\nprosperity.\r\nI welcome the re-engagement of Israelis and \r\nPalestinians in direct negotiations and the bold \r\ndiplomacy that made that possible. If we are serious \r\nabout achieving a two-State solution, then we must \r\nrecognize that the window is closing fast. I urge the \r\nparties to show leadership and a sense of the long-term \r\ninterests of their peoples and the region. I am going to \r\nconvene the Quartet principals meeting later this week \r\nin New York to lend our strong support to the ongoing \r\nMiddle East peace process.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nBeyond the Middle East and North Africa, I see \r\nAfrican countries writing a new chapter in which \r\ndynamism goes hand-in-hand with democracy and \r\neconomic growth that is both sustained and impressive. \r\nIn Somalia, political progress; in Mali, credible \r\nelections; in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nmore robust peacekeeping; and for the Great Lakes \r\nregion, a new framework agreement — these are \r\nachievements on which we can build.\r\nHowever, in the Sahel, abject poverty remains and \r\ninstability persists. In the Central African Republic, the \r\npublic order has collapsed. Millions of people have been \r\ncut off from all assistance and risk becoming victims \r\nof abuse. Yet, like the humanitarian appeal for Syria, \r\nour appeal for aid for that country has only generated \r\ncontributions that are desperately insufficient.\r\nIn just the past week, horrific attacks committed \r\nin Kenya, in Iraq and in Pakistan again remind us of \r\nthe amount of harm that terrorists can wreak and the \r\ndamage they can cause. Throughout the world, we \r\nagain note that human rights and the rule of law are \r\n4/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nopportunity to make a difference, wherever it might \r\noccur..\r\nI am the child of those parents. And as I had an \r\nopportunity to recall just yesterday, at the ceremony for \r\nthe unveiling of the winning design for the permanent \r\nmemorial to honour victims of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade, my ancestral journey began centuries ago, in an \r\nera when unspeakable cruelty and man’s inhumanity \r\nto man were in full bloom and were, in many ways, \r\nthe currency of the day. And while my recent history \r\nhas been one filled with tremendous opportunity and \r\nchallenges, it has, nevertheless, been quite a journey. \r\nI therefore stand before the Assembly, deeply humbled \r\nand honoured to address this gathering of nations, \r\nwhich is a unique representation and expression of our \r\ncollective thoughts and actions.\r\nWe come from nations big and small — some \r\nlandlocked and others surrounded by seas; some \r\nprosperous and others striving to develop. But we all \r\nlive in a world where constant change is the norm. In \r\nfact, this session convenes in a climate and at a time \r\nin history in which the Organization is, itself, in the \r\nprocess of change. I refer not only to physical change, \r\nbut to the task of crafting a more responsive United \r\nNations, with a new strategic thrust, which will shape \r\nglobal development beyond 2015.\r\nThis annual gathering of world leaders and \r\ndignitaries should not be seen as just another September \r\nroutine or tradition; rather, it serves and should \r\nserve another larger and better purpose — that of \r\nrecommitting ourselves and our countries to the noble \r\nideals that lie at the Organization’s core.\r\nAs we gather here again — this being the first \r\ntime for many present, including my two sons sitting \r\nat the back — in the slightly more modest surroundings \r\nthat is now our Hall, the world’s headlines are filled \r\nwith reports of war, imminent or impending; civil \r\nand sectarian bloodshed and strife between as well \r\nas within States; grinding poverty and malnutrition; \r\ngender violence; adverse effects of climate change and \r\nloss of valuable biodiversity; and struggles of men, \r\nwomen and the young seeking to live in human dignity \r\nand peace. Now with clear awareness that the scourge \r\nof chemical warfare has been unleashed in Syria, we \r\nare, as a community of nations, confronted by an urgent \r\nneed to address that wrong.\r\nAgainst that background, we are assembled here, \r\nat this session, amidst circumstances that increasingly \r\nand ushering in an era of sustainable development and \r\nlasting peace. They can tackle the toughest problems \r\ntoday and by their foresight make a gift to future \r\ngenerations.I urge everyone to embrace the global logic \r\nof our times. With our fates ever more entwined, our \r\nfuture must be one of ever-deeper cooperation. In this \r\ntransformed global landscape, let us find new ways \r\nof governing, partnering and problem-solving. Let us \r\nempower the United Nations to be more than a first \r\nresponder or a last resort.\r\nChange is inevitable, but progress is not. Leadership \r\nmakes the difference. Let us take our cue from Nelson \r\nMandela — frail today, but forever in our awareness as \r\na towering model of integrity and principled action in \r\nthe pursuit of human dignity. The leaders in their home \r\ncountries and we assembled here represent a privileged \r\npinnacle. We must prove ourselves fit for purpose. We \r\nmust listen to the just demands of the world’s peoples \r\nand hear the call of history. We speak often of hope. \r\nOur duty is to turn hope into action, through hard \r\nwork, commitment, skill and integrity. With passion, \r\nbut most of all with compassion, we can build the \r\nfuture our peoples want – and that our world needs. \r\nI thank everyone here for their leadership and strong \r\ncommitment. Let us build a better world for all; let us \r\nshape a future where everybody can live harmoniously \r\nin peace and dignity.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I will now deliver a statement in \r\nmy capacity as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-eighth session. \r\nIt is my special privilege to bid members of the \r\nAssembly a warm welcome at the sixty-eighth session. \r\nAs I do so, I am reminded of the long journey to this \r\npoint in time — a journey that began nearly six decades \r\nago in my twin-island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nin the Caribbean. There, in a household of seven kids, \r\nwhose parents never had the opportunity to complete \r\nhigh school and could therefore not provide academic \r\nguidance to their offspring, one child — whose paternal \r\ngrandfather signed his name with an “X” and whose \r\nmother was a descendant of slave plantation owners in \r\nthe sister island of Barbados — was determined to be \r\nthe first in his family to attend university and seek an \r\n13-48449 5/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nsetbacks; must empathize with all Members and yet \r\nbe dispassionate and even-handed, showing no fear \r\nor favour to one over the other; and must endlessly \r\nimprovise as he or she seeks to nudge one side or the \r\nother, or preferably both, towards common ground. \r\nAnd yet, the paradox is that the President of the General \r\nAssembly is without power to commit Member States \r\nto a particular course of action, and must not only \r\nremain neutral but must also be seen as such if she or \r\nhe is to retain any credibility. She or he can do no more \r\nthan reflect and appeal to States to work together, in \r\nthe hope that appropriate and requisite international \r\ncooperation will be achieved.\r\nNow, having said all of this, I can therefore make \r\nan immediate appeal to the Member States to recognize \r\nthose limitations on the presidency and show kind \r\nconsideration by working effectively towards our \r\nshared agenda.\r\nWe have been told by our forebears that, when we are \r\nfaced with overwhelming odds, it is not our limitations \r\nthat define us; rather, it is what we do to overcome \r\nthem. As I said in my June acceptance speech from this \r\nvery rostrum, coming from a small island developing \r\nState I take to heart the oft-repeated maxim that no man \r\nor woman is an island. Given the giant tasks ahead of \r\nus, we need to rely — indeed, depend — on each other \r\nif we are to perform effectively on this shared journey.\r\nTherefore, whenever we see gaps between the \r\nvision of the Charter and the realities around us, let the \r\nsearch to bridge them begin with ourselves. Let it begin \r\nwith an examination by each one of us of the attitudes \r\nthat we bring to this very forum. Let us remember that \r\nno State can abrogate the principles of the Charter \r\nwithout doing serious harm to the fabric of our shared \r\nOrganization.\r\nAs President of the General Assembly, I am \r\nprepared to make contributions of good, sound advice \r\nand point the Assembly in the direction where I think \r\nthe balance of the interests of the entire international \r\ncommunity lies. But it is the Member States that must \r\ndo the heavy lifting and commit to working on a shared \r\nagenda.\r\nOn the issue of our shared agenda, I am pleased to \r\nnote that recently there have been some encouraging \r\nachievements that demonstrate that we know how to \r\nmake the United Nations work for us as a collective \r\nand collaborative Organization. It was little more than \r\nfive months ago, on 2 April, that, for the first time in \r\ncause many to wonder whether the vision of our \r\nfounding fathers, and mothers, as articulated in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, is achievable or realistic.\r\nAcross this world of ours, we see rising ethnic and \r\nreligious extremism, gender inequities, growing unrest \r\nand political tension, and increasing socioeconomic \r\ninequalities. We see women dying in childbirth, girl \r\nchildren marrying before the age of 10, and the young \r\nwho dare not dream of a future because they know all \r\ntoo well there may never be one.\r\nAnd yet, we gather here today despite the odds that \r\nare against us, to give human expression to the hard \r\nwork it takes to make multilateralism work for the \r\ncollective benefit of all. Effective multilateralism takes \r\ndogged determination and a commitment to negotiating \r\nand working cooperatively, especially if the quest is to \r\nevolve towards a shared consensus that is both broad \r\nand lasting. It also requires frank and unvarnished \r\nscrutiny of the work of our Assembly, and it is time \r\nfor us to concede that our efforts at reforming and \r\nrevitalizing our Organization need new impetus.\r\nI ask the Assembly to indulge me as someone who \r\nis at heart an engineer. It is as if, having set out on a \r\nlong journey towards an agreed destination, our vehicle \r\nhas developed engine trouble that slows our progress \r\nand prevents us from making good speed towards \r\nour destination. We tinker with road maps, plans and \r\ndirections without consensus on what needs fixing and \r\nthe best means to fix it. And while we the leaders, as \r\ndrivers of the vehicle, remain parked some distance \r\nfrom our final destination, debating how best to fix the \r\nengine, our passengers, the citizens of the world whom \r\nwe represent, look on powerless and voiceless, many of \r\nthem dying of hunger and thirst with no access to food \r\nor clean water.\r\nThe question before us then is simple. Will we be \r\nable to work together and fix our vehicle so that we can \r\nprogress on the journey to effect real and meaningful \r\nchange?\r\nI must confess that I see contained within the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly a great paradox. \r\nThe holder of this office is exposed to enormous \r\npressures from various sides on any particular issue \r\nrelevant to the mandate of the United Nations. He or she \r\nmust display endless patience; must not be discouraged \r\nby others’ cynicism; must manifest an unswerving \r\ndedication to and belief in the principles and purposes \r\nof the Organization; must be strong enough to overcome \r\n6/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nLet us prove the naysayers wrong. Let us put our \r\nshoulders to the plough and work with one another in \r\na spirit of collaboration. Let us focus on the business \r\nahead, cognizant of the sacred trust that brings us here, \r\ncommitted to the peoples we serve, looking beyond \r\nindividual and narrow interests and with the resolve to \r\nconclude the work that brought us here. \r\nLet us not forget that while we sit in this gathering, \r\nthere are millions who go to sleep in the dark, hungry \r\nand insecure, fearful of what another tomorrow may \r\nbring. Let us not be distracted or disturbed by pessimism \r\nand polemics. Indeed, I invite all of us to look around \r\nand see in our presence here a reaffirmation of our \r\nbelief in the principles of the Charter and in the value of \r\ninternational cooperation for the common good. Let us \r\nnot forget the fundamental belief that the ties that bind \r\nus are stronger and more enduring than the differences \r\nthat threaten to keep us apart.\r\nWe are assembled here from different States, each \r\nwith its own particular set of strengths, challenges and \r\nneeds, and from different regions, cultures and faiths, \r\nall sharing the single purpose of helping to ensure that \r\nthe General Assembly will take us further along the \r\nroad to creating the kind of world envisioned in our \r\nCharter — a world of security, peace, justice, adherence \r\nto the rule of law, respect for the planet, tolerance, equal \r\nrights for all, social progress and faith in the dignity \r\nand worth of the human person. And, recognizing how \r\nfar we have come, conceding how far there is yet to \r\ngo, let us recommit to the path of protecting our planet \r\nand ensuring peace, prosperity and dignity for all who \r\ninhabit it.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers for the general debate has been established \r\non the agreed basis that statements should be no longer \r\nthan 15 minutes — myself and the Secretary-General \r\nexcluded, of course — to enable all the speakers to be \r\nheard at a given meeting. Within that time frame, I would \r\nlike to appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nnormal speed so that interpretation into the six official \r\nUnited Nations languages may be provided properly.\r\nI would also like to draw attention to the decision \r\ntaken by the General Assembly at previous sessions \r\nthat the practice of expressing congratulations inside \r\nthe Assembly Hall after a speech has been delivered \r\nis strongly discouraged. In that connection, after \r\ndelivering their statements, speakers are invited to exit \r\nthe history of our Organization, its engagement with \r\nconventional weapons reached a conclusion with the \r\nadoption of the Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the illicit \r\ntrade in small arms and light weapons. It is expected \r\nthat this instrument, which has now been signed by \r\n83 States and ratified by four, will help significantly \r\nreduce the murderous and destabilizing effects of the \r\nproliferation of such weapons.\r\nAlso, I recall with immense satisfaction that in 2000 \r\nthis very body adopted the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and, subsequently, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which united the international \r\ncommunity around an ambitious series of goals for \r\ndevelopment. More recently, at the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio, we \r\nresolved to craft a post-2015 development agenda. \r\nDefining our post-2015 development agenda is \r\ncrucial to the overall work and longer term efficacy \r\nof the United Nations, and that is why I have selected \r\nas the theme this session, “The post-2015 development \r\nagenda: setting the stage”. Under this rubric and to \r\nassist Member States in defining the outlines of this \r\nnew agenda, I have identified three high-level events \r\nand three thematic debates, which will be held in the \r\ncourse of the present session. The details of these are \r\nalready well known and have been previously shared \r\nwith all Members.\r\nThe new development agenda is expected to have \r\npoverty eradication as its central and overarching goal, \r\nand to address the inseparable link between economic \r\ngrowth, equity and social inclusion, and environmental \r\nsustainability. The post-2015 development agenda is \r\nenvisaged as the most far-reaching endeavour ever \r\nundertaken by our Organization in its entire history. \r\nEmbracing States in all aspects of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment spectrum, it will completely redefine the \r\nconcept of development as traditionally understood, \r\nrooting it in partnership, cooperation, equity — both \r\nsocial and generational — peace, good governance \r\nand economic growth based on environmental \r\nsustainability.\r\nAs we embark on the sixty-eighth session, on the \r\none hand, we urgently need tangible results and action \r\nby the Assembly; on the other hand, we are faced with \r\nhigh levels of pessimism and cynicism that we will \r\nnot be up to the task and that we lack the effort and \r\ndiscipline to effectively address the world’s needs.\r\n13-48449 7/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nof electronic espionage have provoked indignation and \r\ndisgust in public opinion worldwide. For Brazil the \r\nsituation is particularly serious, since we have been a \r\nspecific target of that intrusion. Citizens’ personal data \r\nhas been indiscriminately targeted and intercepted. \r\nBusiness information, often of major economic and even \r\nstrategic value, has been a focus of espionage activity. \r\nAnd communications of Brazilian diplomatic missions, \r\nincluding our Permanent Mission to the United Nations \r\nand the Office of the President of the Republic itself, \r\nhave been subject to interception.\r\nSuch meddling in the lives and affairs of other \r\ncountries is a breach of international law and as such \r\nis an affront to the principles that should govern \r\nrelations between them, and between friendly nations \r\nin particular. A nation can never promote its own \r\nsovereignty in a way that damages the sovereignty of \r\nanother. The right of one country’s citizens to security \r\ncan never be ensured by violating the fundamental \r\nhuman and civil rights of those of another. It is even \r\nworse when private companies support such espionage \r\nactivity. The argument that the illegal interception of \r\ninformation and data is allegedly intended to protect \r\nagainst terrorism is untenable.\r\nBrazil knows how to protect itself. We repudiate \r\nand fight terrorist groups; we do not give them shelter. \r\nWe are a democratic country surrounded by democratic, \r\npeaceful countries that respect international law. We \r\nhave lived in peace with our neighbours for more than \r\n140 years. Like many other Latin Americans, I have \r\nfought arbitrary behaviour and censorship myself and \r\ntherefore cannot possibly fail to uncompromisingly \r\ndefend individuals’ right to privacy and the sovereignty \r\nof my country. \r\nWithout the right to privacy there is no real \r\nfreedom of speech and opinion and therefore no genuine \r\ndemocracy. Without respect for sovereignty there is \r\nno basis for normal relations among nations. What we \r\nhave before us is a serious violation of human rights \r\nand civil liberties through the invasion and capture of \r\nconfidential secret information pertaining to business \r\nactivities and, above all, a case of disrespect for the \r\nnational sovereignty of my country. We have registered \r\nour protest with the Government of the United States \r\nand we have demanded explanations, apologies and \r\nguarantees that such procedures will never be repeated.\r\nFriendly Governments and societies that seek \r\nto build a truly strategic partnership, as in our case, \r\nthe Hall through Room GA-200, located behind the \r\npodium, before returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate \r\nof the sixty-eighth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Finally, I would like to draw the \r\nattention of members to the fact that during the general \r\ndebate, official photos of all speakers are taken by the \r\nDepartment of Public Information. Members interested \r\nin obtaining those photos are requested to contact the \r\nPhoto Library of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rousseff (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would first like to \r\nbriefly express my pleasure at seeing the representative \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda, a country that is part of the \r\nCaribbean and is very dear to Brazil and our region, \r\nat the helm of the proceedings of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. You can count on the permanent \r\nsupport of my Government, Sir.\r\nBefore I begin my statement, I would also like \r\nto voice the Brazilian Government’s and people’s \r\nrepudiation of the recent terrorist attack in Nairobi, and \r\nto convey our condolences to and express our solidarity \r\nwith the families of the victims and the people and the \r\nGovernment of Kenya. Wherever terrorism may occur \r\nand wherever it originates, we will always condemn it \r\nunequivocally and resolve firmly to deal with it. We \r\nwill never compromise with barbarity.\r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nan exceedingly important and serious matter. Recent \r\nrevelations concerning the activities of a global network \r\n8/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nThe choice of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nas the theme for this session of the General Assembly \r\ncould not be more appropriate. The fight against \r\npoverty, hunger and inequality constitutes the greatest \r\nchallenge of our time. For that reason, Brazil has \r\nadopted a socially inclusive economic model based \r\non generating employment, strengthening small-\r\nscale family agriculture, expanding credit, increasing \r\nthe worth of salaries and developing a vast social \r\nprotection network, particularly through our family \r\nstipend programme. In addition to those achievements, \r\nwe have lifted 22 million Brazilians out of extreme \r\npoverty in only two years through out plan to free \r\nBrazil of extreme poverty. We have drastically reduced \r\nchild mortality. A recent UNICEF report indicates \r\nthat Brazil has achieved one of the most significant \r\nreductions in the child mortality in the world.\r\nChildren are a top priority for Brazil. That is \r\nreflected in our commitment to education. We are the \r\ncountry that has most increased public investment in \r\neducation, according to the latest Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development report. We \r\nhave also just approved legislation that earmarks 75 per \r\ncent of all petroleum revenue to education and 25 per \r\ncent to health services.\r\nIn the debate on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda we must focus on the results of the Rio de \r\nJaneiro United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment as key drivers. The major step taken in \r\nRio de Janeiro was to place poverty at the very centre \r\nof the sustainable development agenda. Poverty is \r\nnot a problem exclusive to developing countries, and \r\nenvironmental protection is not a goal to achieve only \r\nafter poverty is overcome. The meaning of the post-\r\n2015 agenda is the development of a world in which it is \r\npossible to grow, to include, to conserve and to protect. \r\nBy promoting social mobility and overcoming extreme \r\npoverty, as we are doing, we have created an immense \r\ncontingent of citizens with improved quality of life, \r\nincreased access to information and greater awareness \r\nof their rights — citizens with new hopes, new desires \r\nand new demands.\r\nThe demonstrations last June in Brazil were an \r\ninseparable part of our process of building democracy \r\nand of social change. My Administration did not repress \r\nthem; on the contrary, it listened to and understood the \r\nvoices from the streets. We listened and understood \r\nbecause we ourselves came from the streets. We \r\nourselves came of age and developed through the great \r\ncannot possibly allow recurring illegal actions to take \r\nplace as if they constituted a normal, ordinary practice. \r\nThey are unacceptable. Brazil will redouble its efforts \r\nto adopt legislation, technologies and mechanisms to \r\nprotect us adequately from the illegal interception of \r\ncommunications and data. My Administration will \r\ndo everything within its reach and powers to defend \r\nthe human rights of all Brazilians and all the world’s \r\ncitizens, as well as to protect the fruits of the ingenuity \r\nof Brazilian workers and companies.\r\nThe problem, however, goes beyond the bilateral \r\nrelationship of two countries. It affects the international \r\ncommunity itself and demands a response from it. \r\nInformation and telecommunication technologies \r\ncannot become the new battlefield among States. \r\nThe time is ripe to create the conditions to prevent \r\ncyberspace from being used as a weapon of war through \r\nespionage, sabotage and attacks against the systems and \r\ninfrastructure of other countries. The United Nations \r\nmust play a leading role in the effort to properly regulate \r\nthe conduct of States with regard to those technologies. \r\nIt should also consider the importance of the Internet \r\nand social networks as part of our efforts to build \r\ndemocracy worldwide.\r\nFor that reason, Brazil will present proposals for \r\nthe establishment of a multilateral civil framework \r\nfor the governance and use of the Internet, as well \r\nas measures to guarantee the effective protection \r\nof the data and information that traverse it. We must \r\nestablish multilateral mechanisms for the worldwide \r\nweb that are capable of ensuring key principles. The \r\nfirst is freedom of expression, individual privacy and \r\nrespect for human rights; secondly, multilateral, open \r\ndemocratic governance, conducted with transparency \r\nwhile stimulating collective creativity and the broad \r\nparticipation of civil society, Governments and the \r\nprivate sector; thirdly, the principle of universality, \r\nwhich ensures social and human development along with \r\nthe construction of inclusive and non-discriminatory \r\nsocieties; fourthly, cultural diversity, without the \r\nimposition of beliefs, customs or values; and fifthly, the \r\nneutrality of the web, which must be governed only by \r\ntechnical and ethical criteria, rendering unacceptable \r\nany restriction of it for political, commercial, religious \r\nor any other purposes. Harnessing the full potential of \r\nthe Internet therefore requires responsible regulation \r\nthat will simultaneously guarantee the freedom of \r\nexpression, security and respect for human rights.\r\n13-48449 9/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\ntowards sound macroeconomic policies; secondly, \r\ncontinuing and upholding successful social inclusion \r\npolicies; and thirdly, the adoption of measures aimed \r\nat increasing our productivity, and therefore our \r\ninternational competitiveness. We are committed to \r\nstability and inflation-control, to improving the quality \r\nof public spending and to upholding proper fiscal \r\nperformance. \r\nWe reiterate our support for a reform of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. The governance of \r\nthe Fund should reflect the weight of emerging and \r\ndeveloping countries in the world economy. Delaying \r\nsuch adaptive reform will further reduce the Fund’s \r\nlegitimacy and effectiveness.\r\nThe year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the \r\n2005 World Summit. As such, it will be an occasion \r\nfor us to carry out the urgent reform that we have been \r\ncalling for since that first summit. We must avoid a \r\ncollective defeat of coming to 2015 without a Security \r\nCouncil capable of fully exercising its responsibilities in \r\ntoday’s world. The limited representation in the Security \r\nCouncil, in view of the new challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, is a source of grave concern. Examples of \r\nthat concern include the huge difficulty in providing a \r\nsolution for the ongoing Syrian conflict and the state of \r\nparalysis in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian question. \r\nThe recurrent polarization among permanent members \r\non important issues has led to a dangerous inaction. The \r\nCouncil must be urgently endowed with voices that are \r\nboth independent and constructive. Only by expanding \r\nthe number of permanent and non-permanent members \r\nof the Security Council and by including developing \r\ncountries in both categories will it be possible to \r\nsolve and overcome the current representativeness and \r\nlegitimacy deficits from which the Council suffers.\r\nThe general debate provides us with an opportunity \r\nto reiterate the fundamental principles that guide my \r\ncountry’s foreign policy and inform our stance on \r\npressing issues on today’s international agenda. We \r\nguide ourselves and our actions through a defence of a \r\nmultilateral world governed by international law, where \r\nthe peaceful solution of conflicts holds sway and where \r\nthe pursuit of a fair and solidarity-based order prevails \r\nboth economically and socially.\r\nThe crisis in Syria has caused unrest and breeds a \r\nsense of anger. Two and a half years of lives lost and \r\ndestruction have caused the greatest humanitarian \r\ndisaster of the century.\r\nstruggles of Brazil. The street is our ground, our base. \r\nThe protesters did not ask for a return to the past. \r\nRather, they asked for further progress towards a future \r\nof greater rights, more participation and more social \r\ngains.\r\nIn Brazil, it was during this decade that we \r\nexperienced the greatest reduction in social inequality \r\nin the past 50 years. It was during this decade that we \r\ncreated a system of social protection that has allowed \r\nus to nearly eradicate extreme poverty. We know all \r\ntoo well that democracy generates the desire for more \r\ndemocracy, that social inclusion creates demands for \r\nfurther social inclusion, and that quality of life awakens \r\npeople’s yearning for even more quality of life. For us, \r\nall the progress achieved thus far is just a beginning. \r\nOur development strategy demands more, as desired by \r\nall Brazilians.\r\nIt is not enough to listen. We must act. We must \r\ntransform this extraordinary energy into achievements \r\nfor everyone. I have therefore launched five major \r\npacts: a pact against corruption and for political \r\nreform; a pact for urban mobility, geared towards \r\nthe improvement of public transportation and urban \r\nreform; a pact for education, our great passport to the \r\nfuture, which will be supported by royalties from oil \r\nrevenues and the petroleum social fund; a health pact \r\nthat provides for doctors to assist Brazilians in the \r\npoorest and most remote regions of the country; and \r\na fiscal responsibility pact, to guarantee the economic \r\nviability of this new stage in our history.\r\nAlthough the most acute phase of the crisis is behind \r\nus, the situation of the world economy remains fragile, \r\nwith unacceptable levels of unemployment. According \r\nto statistics from the International Labor Organization, \r\nthere are more than 200 million unemployed people \r\nthroughout the world. That phenomenon affects \r\npopulations of both developed and developing countries. \r\nThis is the right time for us to strengthen the trends \r\nfor growth in the world’s economy, which is showing \r\nsigns of recovery. Emerging countries alone cannot \r\nensure the resumption of global growth. More than ever \r\nbefore, it is necessary to engage in concerted action \r\nin order to reduce unemployment and re-establish \r\nmomentum in international trade. We are all in the \r\nsame boat.\r\nMy country is restoring growth despite the impact \r\nof the international crisis of the past few years. We \r\nhave relied on three key elements: first, a commitment \r\n10/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nwould be able to overcome the wounds of the Second \r\nWorld War and the hope that, yes, it would be possible \r\nto build, from the rubble of destruction and massacre, \r\na new world of liberty, solidarity and prosperity. We all \r\nhave the responsibility not to let such a generous and \r\nfruitful hope die. \r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federative Republic \r\nof Brazil for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Barack Obama, President of the \r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United State of America.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Obama: Each year we come together to \r\nreaffirm the founding vision of this institution. For most \r\nof recorded history, individual aspirations were subject \r\nto the whims of tyrants and empires, and divisions of \r\nrace, religion and tribe were settled through the sword \r\nand the clash of armies. \r\nThe idea that nations and peoples could come \r\ntogether in peace to solve their disputes and advance a \r\ncommon prosperity seemed unimaginable. It took the \r\nawful carnage of two world wars to shift our thinking. \r\nThe leaders who built the United Nations were not naive. \r\nThey did not think that this body could eradicate all \r\nwars. But in the wake of millions dead and continents \r\nin rubble and with the development of nuclear weapons \r\nthat could annihilate a planet, they understood that \r\nhumanity could not survive the course it was on. They \r\ngave us this institution, believing that it could allow \r\nus to resolve conflicts, enforce rules of behaviour and \r\nbuild habits of cooperation that would grow stronger \r\nover time.\r\nFor decades, the United Nations has in fact made \r\na difference, from helping to eradicate disease to \r\nBrazil’s population of Syrian descent is an important \r\ncomponent of our nationality identity, Our country \r\nis thus deeply involved with the plight of the Syrian \r\npeople. It is necessary to prevent the killing of innocent \r\npeople — women, children and the elderly — and to \r\nsilence weapons, whether they be conventional or \r\nchemical or whether they be used by the Government \r\nor by the rebels. There is no military way out. The \r\nonly solution is through negotiation, dialogue and \r\nunderstanding.\r\nSyria’s decision to accede to the Chemical Weapons \r\nConvention and enforce it immediately was an important \r\ndevelopment. As such, the measure is decisive for \r\novercoming the conflict and helps build a world free of \r\nchemical weapons. I would like to stress that the use of \r\nsuch weapons is heinous and unacceptable under any \r\ncircumstances. We therefore support the agreement \r\nreached between the United States and the Russian \r\nFederation to eliminate Syria’s chemical weapons. It \r\nis incumbent upon the Syrian Government to fulfil the \r\nagreement in its entirety and do so in good faith and \r\nin a spirit of cooperation. Under all circumstances and \r\nin any case, we repudiate unilateral interventions in \r\nviolation of international law and without authorization \r\nby the Security Council. Unilateral intervention would \r\nonly further worsen the lack of political stability in the \r\nregion and would increase human suffering. \r\nLikewise, lasting peace between Israel and Palestine \r\nhas taken on a new and pressing dimension given the \r\nsweeping changes that the Middle East is currently \r\nundergoing. The time has come to meet the legitimate \r\nPalestinian aspiration for an independent and sovereign \r\nState. The time has also come for us to bring about a \r\nbroad international consensus for a two-State solution. \r\nThe current talks between Israelis and Palestinians \r\nshould yield practical and significant results in favour \r\nof an agreement.\r\nThe history of the twentieth century shows that \r\nabandoning the multilateral system is a prelude to \r\nwar, with the ensuing trail of human destitution and \r\ndevastation. The history of the twentieth century \r\nalso shows that promoting the multilateral system \r\nbears fruit on the ethical, political and institutional \r\nfronts. May I therefore renew an appeal for a broad, \r\nvigorous convergence of political will that will uphold \r\nand reinvigorate the multilateral system, of which the \r\nUnited Nations is the main pillar.\r\nWhen the United Nations was founded, the peoples \r\nof the world rallied around the hope that humankind \r\n13-48449 11/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nthose who have been affected. In Pakistan, nearly 100 \r\npeople were recently killed by suicide bombers outside \r\na church. In Iraq, killings and car bombs continue to be \r\na terrible part of life.\r\nMeanwhile, Al-Qaida has splintered into regional \r\nnetworks and militias, which does not give them the \r\ncapacity at this point to carry out attacks like 9/11 \r\nbut does pose serious threats to Governments and \r\ndiplomats, businesses and civilians all across the globe. \r\nJust as significantly, the convulsions in the Middle East \r\nand North Africa have laid bare deep divisions within \r\nsocieties, as an old order is upended and people grapple \r\nwith what is coming next. Peaceful movements have too \r\noften been answered by violence from those resisting \r\nchange and from extremists trying to hijack change. \r\nSectarian conflict has re-emerged, and the potential \r\nspread of weapons of mass destruction continues to cast \r\na shadow over the pursuit of peace.\r\nNowhere have we seen those trends converge \r\nmore powerfully than in Syria. There, peaceful \r\nprotests against an authoritarian regime were met with \r\nrepression and slaughter. In the face of such carnage, \r\nmany retreated to their sectarian identities — Alawite \r\nand Sunni, Christian and Kurd — and the situation \r\nspiralled into civil war.\r\nThe international community recognized the stakes \r\nearly on, but our response has not matched the scale of \r\nthe challenge. Aid cannot keep pace with the suffering \r\nof the wounded and displaced. A peace process is \r\nstillborn. America and others have worked to bolster \r\nthe moderate opposition, but extremist groups have still \r\ntaken root to exploit the crisis.\r\nAl-Assad’s traditional allies have propped him up, \r\nciting principles of sovereignty to shield his regime. \r\nOn 21 August, the regime used chemical weapons in \r\nan attack that killed more than 1,000 people, including \r\nhundreds of children. Today, the crisis in Syria and the \r\ndestabilization of the region goes to the heart of broader \r\nchallenges that the international community must now \r\nconfront. How should we respond to conflicts in the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa — conflicts between \r\ncountries, but also conflicts within them? How do we \r\naddress the choice between standing callously by while \r\nchildren are subjected to nerve gas and embroiling \r\nourselves in someone else’s civil war? What is the role of \r\nforce in resolving disputes that threaten the stability of \r\na region and undermine all basic standards of civilized \r\nconduct? And what is the role of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law in meeting cries for justice?\r\neducating children and brokering peace. But like \r\nevery generation of leaders, we face new and profound \r\nchallenges, and this body continues to be tested. The \r\nquestion is whether we possess the wisdom and the \r\ncourage as nation States and members of an international \r\ncommunity to squarely meet those challenges. Can the \r\nUnited Nations meet the test of our time?\r\nAnd for much of my tenure as President, some of \r\nour most urgent challenges have revolved around an \r\nincreasingly integrated global economy and our efforts \r\nto recover from the worst economic crisis of our lifetime. \r\nNow, five years after the global economy collapsed and \r\nthanks to coordinated efforts by the countries here \r\ntoday, jobs are being created, global financial systems \r\nhave stabilized and people are once again being lifted \r\nout of poverty. But this progress is fragile and unequal, \r\nand we still have work to do together to assure that our \r\ncitizens can access the opportunities that they need in \r\norder to thrive in the twenty-first century.\r\nTogether, we have also worked to end a decade of \r\nwar. Five years ago nearly 180,000 Americans were \r\nserving in harm’s way, and the war in Iraq was the \r\ndominant issue in our relationship with the rest of the \r\nworld. Today, all of our troops have left Iraq. Next year an \r\ninternational coalition will end its war in Afghanistan, \r\nhaving achieved its mission of dismantling the core of \r\nAl Qaida that attacked us on 9/11.\r\nFor the United States,  those new circumstances \r\nhave also meant shifting away from a perpetual war \r\nfooting. Beyond bringing our troops home we have \r\nlimited the use of drones so that they target only those \r\nwho pose a continuing imminent threat to the United \r\nStates, when capture is not feasible and when there \r\nis a near certainty of no civilian casualties. We are \r\ntransferring detainees to other countries and trying \r\nterrorists in courts of law, while working diligently to \r\nclose the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Just as we have \r\nreviewed how we deploy our extraordinary military \r\ncapabilities in a way that lives up to our ideals, we have \r\nbegun to review the way that we gather intelligence, \r\nso that we properly balance the legitimate security \r\nconcerns of our citizens and allies with the privacy \r\nconcerns that all people share.\r\nAs a result of such work and cooperation with \r\nallies and partners, the world is more stable than it was \r\nfive years ago. But even a glance at today’s headlines \r\nindicates that dangers remain. In Kenya, we have \r\nseen terrorists target innocent civilians in a crowded \r\nshopping mall. Our hearts go out to the families of \r\n12/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nweapons has no place in the twenty-first century and \r\nthat this Organization means what it says.\r\nOur agreement on chemical weapons should \r\nenergize a larger diplomatic effort to reach a political \r\nsettlement within Syria. I do not believe that military \r\naction by those within Syria or by external Powers can \r\nachieve a lasting peace, nor do I believe that America \r\nor any nation should determine who will lead Syria. \r\nThat is for the Syrian people to decide. Nevertheless, a \r\nleader who has slaughtered his own citizens and gassed \r\nchildren to death cannot regain the legitimacy to lead \r\na badly fractured country. The notion that Syria can \r\nreturn to a pre-war status quo is a fantasy. \r\nIt is time for Russia and Iran to realize that insisting \r\non Al-Assad’s rule will lead directly to the outcome that \r\nthey fear — an increasingly violent space for extremists \r\nto operate in. In turn, those of us who continue to \r\nsupport the moderate opposition must persuade them \r\nthat the Syrian people cannot afford a collapse of State \r\ninstitutions and that a political settlement cannot be \r\nreached without addressing the legitimate fears and \r\nconcerns of Alawites and other minorities. \r\nWe are committed to working this political track, \r\nand as we pursue a settlement, let us remember that \r\nthis is not a zero-sum endeavour. We are no longer in \r\na cold war. There is no great game to be won, nor does \r\nAmerica have any interest in Syria beyond the well-\r\nbeing of its people, the stability of its neighbours, the \r\nelimination of chemical weapons and ensuring that it \r\ndoes not become a safe haven for terrorists. I welcome \r\nthe influence of all nations that can help bring about a \r\npeaceful resolution of Syria’s civil war. \r\nAs we move the Geneva process forward, I \r\nurge all nations represented here to step up to meet \r\nthe humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding \r\ncountries. America has committed over a billion dollars \r\nto that effort, and today I can announce that we will be \r\nproviding an additional $340 million. No aid can take \r\nthe place of a political resolution that gives the Syrian \r\npeople the chance to begin rebuilding their country, but \r\nit can help desperate people survive.\r\nWhat broader conclusions can be drawn from \r\nAmerica’s policy towards Syria? I know that there are \r\nthose who have been frustrated by our unwillingness \r\nto use our military might to depose Al-Assad and \r\nbelieve that a failure to do so indicates a weakening of \r\nAmerica’s resolve in the region. Others have suggested \r\nthat my willingness to direct even limited military \r\nToday, I want to outline where the United States of \r\nAmerica stands on those issues.\r\nWith respect to Syria, we believe that, as a starting \r\npoint, the international community must enforce the ban \r\non chemical weapons. When I stated my willingness to \r\norder a limited strike against the Al-Assad regime in \r\nresponse to its brazen use of chemical weapons, I did \r\nnot do so lightly. I did so because I believe that it is \r\nin the national security interests of the United States \r\nand in the interest of the world to meaningfully enforce \r\na prohibition whose origins are older than the United \r\nNations itself. The ban against the use of chemical \r\nweapons, even in war, has been agreed to by 98 percent \r\nof humanity. It is strengthened by the searing memories \r\nof soldiers suffocated in the trenches, Jews slaughtered \r\nin gas chambers, Iranians poisoned in the many tens of \r\nthousands.\r\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the Al-Assad \r\nregime used such weapons on 21 August. United \r\nNations inspectors gave a clear accounting of their \r\nfindings that advanced rockets had fired large \r\nquantities of sarin gas at civilians. Those rockets were \r\nfired from a regime-controlled neighbourhood and \r\nlanded in opposition neighbourhoods. It is an insult to \r\nhuman reason and to the legitimacy of this institution \r\nto suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out \r\nthis attack.\r\nI know that in the immediate aftermath of the attack \r\nthere were those who questioned the legitimacy of even \r\na limited strike in the absence of a clear mandate from \r\nthe Security Council. But without a credible military \r\nthreat, the Security Council had demonstrated no \r\ninclination to act at all. However, as I have discussed \r\nwith President Putin for over a year, most recently in \r\nSt. Petersburg, my preference has always been to work \r\nfor a diplomatic resolution to this issue, and in the past \r\nseveral weeks, the United States, Russia and our allies \r\nhave reached an agreement to place Syria’s chemical \r\nweapons under international control and then destroy \r\nthem.\r\nThe Syrian Government took a first step by giving \r\nan accounting of its stockpiles. Now, there must be a \r\nstrong Security Council resolution to verify that the \r\nAl-Assad regime is keeping its commitments, and there \r\nmust be consequences if they fail to do so. If we cannot \r\nagree even on that, then that will show that the United \r\nNations is incapable of enforcing the most basic of \r\ninternational laws. On the other hand, if we succeed, it \r\nwill send a powerful message that the use of chemical \r\n13-48449 13/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nhelp achieve peace and prosperity. But I also believe \r\nthat we can rarely achieve those objectives through \r\nunilateral American action, particularly military \r\naction. Iraq has shown us that democracy cannot \r\nsimply be imposed by force. Rather, such objectives are \r\nbest achieved when we partner with the international \r\ncommunity and with the countries and peoples of the \r\nregion.\r\nSo what does that mean going forward? In the near \r\nterm, America’s diplomatic efforts will focus on two \r\nparticular issues: Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons \r\nand the Arab-Israeli conflict. While those issues are \r\nnot the cause of all of the region’s problems, they have \r\nbeen a major source of instability for far too long, and \r\nresolving them can help serve as a foundation for a \r\nbroader peace.\r\nThe United States and Iran have been isolated \r\nfrom one another since the Islamic revolution of 1979. \r\nThat mistrust has deep roots. Iranians have long \r\ncomplained of a history of United States interference \r\nin their affairs and of America’s role in overthrowing \r\nan Iranian Government during the cold war. On the \r\nother hand, Americans see an Iranian Government that \r\nhas declared the United States an enemy and directly \r\nor through proxies has taken Americans hostage, killed \r\nUnited States troops and civilians and threatened our \r\nally Israel with destruction.\r\nI do not believe such a difficult history can be \r\novercome overnight. The suspicion runs too deep. But \r\nI do believe that, if we can resolve the issue of Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme, that can serve as a major step down \r\na long road towards a different relationship, one based \r\non mutual interests and mutual respect.\r\nSince I took office, I have made it clear, in letters \r\nto the Supreme Leader in Iran and, more recently, to \r\nPresident Rouhani, that America prefers to resolve its \r\nconcerns over Iran’s nuclear programme peacefully, \r\nalthough we are determined to prevent Iran from \r\ndeveloping a nuclear weapon. We are not seeking regime \r\nchange, and we respect the right of the Iranian people \r\nto access peaceful nuclear energy. Instead, we insist \r\nthat the Iranian Government meet its responsibilities \r\nunder the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons and Security Council resolutions. Meanwhile, \r\nthe Supreme Leader has issued a fatwa against the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons, and President \r\nRouhani has just recently reiterated that the Islamic \r\nRepublic will never develop a nuclear weapon.\r\nstrikes to deter the further use of chemical weapons \r\nshows that we have learned nothing from Iraq, and that \r\nAmerica continues to seek control over the Middle East \r\nfor our own purposes. The situation in Syria mirrors \r\na contradiction that has persisted in the region for \r\ndecades. The United States is chastised for meddling in \r\nthe region and accused of having a hand in all manner \r\nof conspiracies. At the same time, the United States is \r\nblamed for failing to do enough to solve the region’s \r\nproblems and for showing indifference toward suffering \r\nMuslim populations.\r\nI realize that some of that is inevitable, given \r\nAmerica’s role in the world, but such contradictory \r\nattitudes have a practical impact on the American \r\npeople’s support for our involvement in the region \r\nand allow leaders in the region, and the international \r\ncommunity sometimes, to avoid addressing difficult \r\nproblems themselves. So let me take this opportunity \r\nto outline what has been United States policy towards \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa and what will be my \r\npolicy during the remainder of my presidency.\r\nThe United States of America is prepared to use \r\nall elements of our power, including military force, \r\nto secure these core interests in the region. We will \r\nconfront external aggression against our allies and \r\npartners, as we did in the Gulf War. We will ensure \r\nthe free f low of energy from the region to the world. \r\nAlthough America is steadily reducing its own \r\ndependence on imported oil, the world still depends \r\nupon the region’s energy supply, and a severe disruption \r\ncould destabilize the entire global economy. We will \r\ndismantle terrorist networks that threaten our people. \r\nWherever possible, we will build the capacity of our \r\npartners, respect the sovereignty of nations and work \r\nto address the root causes of terror, but when it is \r\nnecessary to defend the United States against terrorist \r\nattack, we will take direct action. Finally, we will not \r\ntolerate the development or use of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. Just as we consider the use of chemical \r\nweapons in Syria to be a threat to our own national \r\nsecurity, we reject the development of nuclear weapons \r\nthat could trigger a nuclear arms race in the region and \r\nundermine the global non-proliferation regime.\r\nNow, to say that those are America’s core interests \r\nis not to say that they are our only interests. We deeply \r\nbelieve that it is in our interest to see a Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa that are peaceful and prosperous, and we \r\nwill continue to promote democracy, human rights and \r\nopen markets, because we believe that those practices \r\n14/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nPalestinians in Ramallah whose ambition and incredible \r\npotential are matched only by the pain they feel in \r\nhaving no firm place in the community of nations. They \r\nare understandably cynical as to whether real progress \r\nwill ever be made, and they are frustrated by their \r\nfamilies enduring the daily indignity of occupation. \r\nBut they, too, recognize that two States is the only real \r\npath to peace, because, just as the Palestinian people \r\nmust not be displaced, the State of Israel is here to stay.\r\nThe time is now ripe for the entire international \r\ncommunity to get behind the pursuit of peace. Already \r\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders have demonstrated a \r\nwillingness to take significant political risks. President \r\nAbbas has put aside efforts to short-cut the pursuit \r\nof peace and come to the negotiating table. Prime \r\nMinister Netanyahu has released Palestinian prisoners \r\nand reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian State. \r\nCurrent talks are focused on final status issues of \r\nborders and security, refugees and Jerusalem.\r\nSo now the rest of us must be willing to take risks \r\nas well. Friends of Israel, including the United States, \r\nmust recognize that Israel’s security as a Jewish and \r\ndemocratic State depends upon the realization of a \r\nPalestinian State, and we should say so clearly. Arab \r\nStates, and those who have supported the Palestinians, \r\nmust recognize that stability will be served only through \r\na two-State solution and a secure Israel. All of us must \r\nrecognize that peace will be a powerful tool to defeat \r\nextremists throughout the region and embolden those \r\nwho are prepared to build a better future. Moreover, \r\nties of trade and commerce between Israelis and Arabs \r\ncould be an engine of growth and opportunity at a \r\ntime when too many young people in the region are \r\nlanguishing without work. So let us emerge from the \r\nfamiliar corners of blame and prejudice. Let us support \r\nIsraeli and Palestinian leaders who are prepared to walk \r\nthe difficult road to peace.\r\nReal breakthroughs on these two issues — Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme and Israeli-Palestinian peace — would \r\nhave a profound and positive impact on the entire Middle \r\nEast and North Africa. But the current convulsions \r\narising out of the Arab Spring remind us that a just and \r\nlasting peace cannot be measured only by agreements \r\nbetween nations. It must also be measured by our ability \r\nto resolve conflict and promote justice within nations. \r\nAnd by that measure, it is clear that all of us have a lot \r\nmore work to do. \r\nWhen peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and \r\nEgypt, the entire world was filled with hope. And \r\nThose statements made by our respective \r\nGovernments should offer the basis for a meaningful \r\nagreement. We should be able to achieve a resolution \r\nthat respects the rights of the Iranian people while \r\ngiving the world confidence that the Iranian programme \r\nis peaceful. But to succeed, conciliatory words will \r\nhave to be matched by actions that are transparent and \r\nverifiable. After all, it is the Iranian Government’s \r\nchoices that have led to the comprehensive sanctions \r\nthat are currently in place. That is not simply an issue \r\nbetween the United States and Iran. The world has \r\nseen Iran evade its responsibilities in the past and has \r\nan abiding interest in making sure that Iran meets its \r\nobligations in future.\r\nBut I want to be clear. We are encouraged by the \r\nfact that President Rouhani received from the Iranian \r\npeople a mandate to pursue a more moderate course. \r\nGiven President Rouhani’s stated commitment to reach \r\nan agreement, I am directing John Kerry to pursue this \r\neffort with the Iranian Government, in close cooperation \r\nwith the European Union, the United Kingdom, France, \r\nGermany, Russia and China.\r\nThe roadblocks may prove to be too great, but I \r\nfirmly believe that the diplomatic path must be tested. \r\nFor while the status quo will only deepen Iran’s isolation, \r\nIran’s genuine commitment to go down a different path \r\nwill be good for the region and the world, and will help \r\nthe Iranian people meet their extraordinary potential in \r\ncommerce and culture, in science and education.\r\nWe are also determined to resolve a conflict that \r\ngoes back even further than our differences with \r\nIran: the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis. \r\nI have made it clear that the United States will never \r\ncompromise our commitment to Israel’s security, nor \r\nour support for its existence as a Jewish State. Earlier \r\nthis year, in Jerusalem, I was inspired by young Israelis \r\nwho stood up for the belief that peace was necessary, \r\njust and possible, and I believe that there is a growing \r\nrecognition within Israel that the occupation of the West \r\nBank is tearing at the democratic fabric of the Jewish \r\nState. But the children of Israel have the right to live in \r\na world where the nations assembled in this body fully \r\nrecognize their country and where we unequivocally \r\nreject those who fire rockets at their homes or incite \r\nothers to hate them.\r\nLikewise, the United States remains committed to \r\nthe belief that the Palestinian people have a right to live \r\nin security and dignity in their own sovereign State. On \r\nthe same trip, I had the opportunity to meet with young \r\n13-48449 15/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nthe Arab world. We believe that they are the birthright \r\nof every person. And while we recognize that our \r\ninfluence will at times be limited, although we will be \r\nwary of efforts to impose democracy through military \r\nforce, and although we will at times be accused of \r\nhypocrisy and inconsistency, we will be engaged in the \r\nregion for the long haul. For the hard work of forging \r\nfreedom and democracy is the task of a generation. \r\nThat includes efforts to resolve sectarian tensions that \r\ncontinue to surface in places like Iraq, Bahrain and \r\nSyria. \r\nWe understand that such long-standing issues \r\ncannot be solved by outsiders; they must be addressed \r\nby Muslim communities themselves. But we have seen \r\ngrinding conflicts come to an end before, most recently \r\nin Northern Ireland, where Catholics and Protestants \r\nfinally recognized that an endless cycle of conflict was \r\ncausing both communities to fall behind a fast-moving \r\nworld. And so we believe that those same sectarian \r\nconflicts can be overcome in the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica. \r\nTo summarize, the United States has a hard-earned \r\nhumility when it comes to our ability to determine \r\nevents inside other countries. The notion of American \r\nempire may be useful propaganda, but it is not borne \r\nout by America’s current policy or public opinion. \r\nIndeed, as recent debates within the United States over \r\nSyria clearly showed, the danger for the world is not an \r\nAmerica that is too eager to immerse itself in the affairs \r\nof other countries or to take on every problem in the \r\nregion as its own. The danger for the world is that the \r\nUnited States, after a decade of war, rightly concerned \r\nabout issues back home and aware of the hostility \r\nthat our engagement in the region has engendered \r\nthroughout the Muslim world, may disengage, creating \r\na vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to \r\nfill.\r\nI believe that such disengagement would be a \r\nmistake. I believe that America must remain engaged \r\nfor our own security, but I also believe that the world \r\nis better for it. Some may disagree, but I believe that \r\nAmerica is exceptional, in part because we have shown \r\na willingness, through the sacrifice of blood and \r\ntreasure, to stand up not only for our own narrow self-\r\ninterest, but for the interests of all. I must be honest, \r\nthough; we are far more likely to invest our energy \r\nin those countries that want to work with us, that \r\ninvest in their people instead of in a corrupt few, and \r\nthat embrace a vision of society where everyone can \r\nalthough the United States, like others, was struck by \r\nthe speed of transition, and although we did not — and \r\nin fact could not — dictate events, we chose to support \r\nthose who called for change. We did so based on the \r\nbelief that while these transitions will be hard and take \r\ntime, societies based upon democracy and openness \r\nand the dignity of the individual will ultimately be \r\nmore stable, more prosperous and more peaceful. \r\nOver the last few years, particularly in Egypt, \r\nwe have seen just how hard this transition will be. \r\nMohammed Morsi was democratically elected, but \r\nproved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was \r\nfully inclusive. The interim Government that replaced \r\nhim responded to the desires of millions of Egyptians \r\nwho believed the revolution had taken a wrong turn, but \r\nit, too, has made decisions inconsistent with inclusive \r\ndemocracy, through an emergency law and restrictions \r\non the press, civil society and opposition parties.\r\nOf course, America has been attacked by all sides \r\nof this internal conflict, simultaneously accused of \r\nsupporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering \r\nits removal from power. In fact, the United States has \r\npurposely avoided choosing sides. Our overriding \r\ninterest throughout these past few years has been to \r\nencourage a Government that legitimately reflects \r\nthe will of the Egyptian people and recognizes true \r\ndemocracy as requiring a respect for minority rights, \r\nthe rule of law, freedom of speech and assembly, and a \r\nstrong civil society.\r\nThat remains our interest today. And so, going \r\nforward, the United States will maintain a constructive \r\nrelationship with the interim Government that promotes \r\ncore interests like the Camp David Accords and counter-\r\nterrorism. We will continue support in areas such as \r\neducation that directly benefit the Egyptian people. \r\nBut we have not proceeded with the delivery of certain \r\nmilitary systems, and our support will depend upon \r\nEgypt’s progress in pursuing a more democratic path. \r\nOur approach to Egypt reflects a larger point: the \r\nUnited States will at times work with Governments \r\nthat do not meet — at least in our view — the highest \r\ninternational expectations, but who work with us on our \r\ncore interests. Nevertheless, we will not stop asserting \r\nprinciples that are consistent with our ideals, whether \r\nthat means opposing the use of violence as a means \r\nof suppressing dissent or supporting the principles \r\nembodied in the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. We will reject the notion that those principles \r\nare simply Western exports, incompatible with Islam or \r\n16/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\ninternational action, Libya would now be engulfed in \r\ncivil war and bloodshed.\r\nWe live in a world of imperfect choices. Different \r\nnations will not agree on the need for action in every \r\ninstance, and the principle of sovereignty is at the centre \r\nof our international order. But sovereignty cannot be \r\na shield for tyrants to commit wanton murder or an \r\nexcuse for the international community to turn a blind \r\neye. While we need to be modest in our belief that we \r\ncan remedy every evil, and while we need to be mindful \r\nthat the world is full of unintended consequences, \r\nshould we really accept the notion that the world is \r\npowerless in the face of a Rwanda or a Srebrenica? If \r\nthat is the world that people want to live in, they should \r\nsay so and reckon with the cold logic of mass graves.\r\nI believe that we can embrace a different future. If \r\nwe do not want to choose between inaction and war, we \r\nmust get better — all of us — at the policies that prevent \r\nthe breakdown of basic order through respect for the \r\nresponsibilities of nations and the rights of individuals, \r\nthrough meaningful sanctions for those who break \r\nthe rules, through dogged diplomacy that resolves the \r\nroot causes of conflict and not merely its aftermath, \r\nand through development assistance that brings hope \r\nto the marginalized. And yes sometimes, all this will \r\nnot be enough and there will be moments when the \r\ninternational community will need to acknowledge that \r\nthe multilateral use of military force may be required to \r\nprevent the very worst from occurring. \r\nUltimately, that is the international community \r\nthat America seeks — one where nations do not covet \r\nthe land or resources of other nations, but one in which \r\nwe carry out the founding purpose of this institution \r\nand where we all take responsibility; a world in which \r\nthe rules established out of the horrors of war can help \r\nus resolve conflicts peacefully and prevent the kind of \r\nwars that our forefathers fought; a world where human \r\nbeings can live with dignity and meet their basic needs, \r\nwhether they live in New York or Nairobi, in Peshawar \r\nor Damascus.\r\nThese are extraordinary times with extraordinary \r\nopportunities. Thanks to human progress, a child \r\nborn anywhere on Earth today can do things that \r\n60 years ago would have been out of reach for the mass \r\nof humankind. I saw this in Africa, where nations \r\nmoving beyond conflict are now poised to take off. \r\nAmerica is with them: partnering to feed the hungry \r\nand to care for the sick and to bring power to places \r\noff the grid. I see it across the Pacific region, where \r\ncontribute — men and women, Shia or Sunni, Muslim, \r\nChristian or Jew. Because from Europe to Asia, from \r\nAfrica to the Americas, nations that have persevered on \r\na democratic path have emerged more prosperous, more \r\npeaceful and more invested in upholding our common \r\nsecurity and our common humanity. And I believe that \r\nthe same will hold true for the Arab world.\r\nThat leads me to a final point. There will be \r\ntimes when the breakdown of societies is so great and \r\nthe violence against civilians so substantial, that the \r\ninternational community will be called upon to act. \r\nThat will require new thinking and some very tough \r\nchoices. While the United Nations was designed to \r\nprevent wars between States, increasingly we face \r\nthe challenge of preventing slaughter within States. \r\nAnd those challenges will grow more pronounced \r\nas we are confronted with States that are fragile or \r\nfailing — places where horrendous violence can put \r\ninnocent men, women and children at risk with no hope \r\nof protection from their national institutions.\r\nI have made it clear that even when America’s core \r\ninterests are not directly threatened, we stand ready to \r\ndo our part to prevent mass atrocities and protect basic \r\nhuman rights. But we cannot and should not bear that \r\nburden alone. In Mali, we supported both the French \r\nintervention that successfully pushed back Al-Qaida \r\nand the African forces who are keeping the peace. In \r\nEast Africa, we are working with partners to bring the \r\nLord’s Resistance Army to an end. And in Libya, when \r\nthe Security Council provided a mandate to protect \r\ncivilians, America joined a coalition that took action. \r\nBecause of what we did there, countless lives were \r\nsaved and a tyrant could not kill his way back to power.\r\nI know that some now criticize the action in \r\nLibya as an object lesson. They point to the problems \r\nthat the country now confronts — a democratically \r\nelected Government struggling to provide security; \r\narmed groups, in some places extremists, ruling parts \r\nof a fractured land — and these critics argue that any \r\nintervention to protect civilians is doomed to fail. Look \r\nat Libya. No one is more mindful of those problems \r\nthan I am, for they resulted in the death of four \r\noutstanding United States citizens who were committed \r\nto the Libyan people, including Ambassador Chris \r\nStevens — a man whose courageous efforts helped save \r\nthe city of Benghazi. But does anyone truly believe that \r\nthe situation in Libya would be better if Al-Qadhafi had \r\nbeen allowed to kill, imprison or brutalize his people \r\ninto submission? It is far more likely that without \r\n13-48449 17/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey.\r\nMr. Abdullah Gül, President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdullah Gül, President of \r\nthe Republic of Turkey, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Gül: I wish to start by extending our \r\nsincere congratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. \r\nAt the dawn of the twenty-first century, we had \r\nevery reason to be optimistic about the future. With the \r\nend of the Cold War, the moral balance of the world \r\nshifted towards the pursuit of peace. A lasting peace \r\nis far more than the mere absence of war. We, the \r\ninternational community, understood the imperative of \r\nworking together for a stable world order. We maintain \r\nour strong commitment to the universal principles of \r\nthe United Nations system and, in a spirit of solidarity \r\nand cooperation, we develop effective international \r\nresponses to the scourge of terrorism. \r\nYet the most profound crises of our times have \r\nbeen emerging from internal conflicts. Such conflicts \r\nhave been increasing in both frequency and magnitude. \r\nThey are largely driven by the problem of political \r\nlegitimacy, which leads the governed to withhold their \r\nconsent and limits the prospects for domestic order. \r\nLeaders without political legitimacy share a common \r\ndelusion. Instead of reading the future and leading \r\ntransformation, they believe that they can buy time \r\nwith irresponsible actions against their own people. \r\nEventually, those domestic conflicts escalate into civil \r\nwars, such as the tragedy we are witnessing in Syria. \r\nThe actions of those leaders have implications for peace \r\nand security beyond their own borders. If some leaders \r\ninsist on defining their security in a way that inflicts \r\ninsecurity upon other nations there can be no collective \r\nsecurity. \r\nToday regional and international peace and security \r\ndepend upon the maintenance of domestic order in each \r\nhundreds of millions have been lifted out of poverty in \r\na single generation. I see it in the faces of young people \r\neverywhere who can access the entire world with the \r\nclick of a button and who are eager to join the cause of \r\neradicating extreme poverty, combating climate change, \r\nstarting businesses, expanding freedom, and leaving \r\nbehind the old ideological battles of the past. That is \r\nwhat is happening in Asia and Africa, it is happening \r\nin Europe and the Americas. That is the future that the \r\npeople of the Middle East and North Africa deserve as \r\nwell, one where they can focus on opportunity, instead \r\nof on whether they will be killed or repressed because \r\nof who they are or what they believe. \r\nTime and again, nations and people have shown \r\na capacity to change, to live up to humanity’s highest \r\nideals, to choose a better history. Last month, I stood \r\nwhere 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. told America \r\nabout his dream, at a time when many people of my \r\nrace could not even vote for President. Earlier this year, \r\nI stood in the small cell where Nelson Mandela endured \r\nfor decades, cut off from his own people and the world. \r\nWho are we to believe that today’s challenges cannot be \r\novercome, when we have seen what changes the human \r\nspirit can bring? Who in this Hall can argue that the \r\nfuture belongs to those who seek to repress that spirit, \r\nrather than to those who seek to liberate it? \r\nI know what side of history I want the United States \r\nof America to be on. We are ready to meet tomorrow’s \r\nchallenges with you, firm in the belief that all men \r\nand women are in fact created equal, each individual \r\npossessed with a dignity and inalienable rights that \r\ncannot be denied. That is why we look to the future \r\nnot with fear, but with hope. That is why we remain \r\nconvinced that this community of nations can deliver \r\na more peaceful, prosperous, and just world to the next \r\ngeneration. \r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. Guterres (Timor-Leste), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\n18/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nchemical weapons, would the international community \r\nhave continued to turn a blind eye to the deaths of more \r\nthan 100,000 people? For how long can we afford to \r\nevade our moral responsibility to the people being \r\nkilled even as we speak here? The conflict neither \r\nbegan with the use of chemical weapons nor will it \r\nend with an agreement to eliminate them. We therefore \r\nbluntly reject any position that is not troubled by the \r\nkilling of innocent people in itself, but only by the \r\nmeans of such killing. Such an approach is immoral and \r\ntotally unacceptable. The agreement to destroy Syria’s \r\nchemical arsenal must not allow the regime to avoid \r\nresponsibility for its other crimes.\r\nSyria, a great country and a great nation, is \r\nconsuming itself. It is a disgrace that the Security \r\nCouncil has failed to uphold its primary responsibility \r\nin that case. It is deeply regrettable that political \r\ndifferences, balance-of-power politics and geopolitical \r\nconsiderations have prevailed over the imperative \r\nto end the tragedy. Staying on this course cannot be \r\nan option. When the tragedy began, we spoke of the \r\nkilling of hundreds of people, then thousands, then \r\ntens of thousands, and now we speak of over a hundred \r\nthousand deaths. If we cannot stop the conflict now, \r\nrest assured that we will be talking about twice that \r\nnumber next year. \r\nI cannot emphasize this enough. Agreement on \r\nchemical weapons must not be allowed to substitute \r\nfor a comprehensive political strategy to address the \r\nsituation in Syria. The conflict has evolved into a real \r\nthreat to regional peace and security. Any recurrence \r\nof the proxy wars of the Cold War era will plunge Syria \r\ninto further chaos.\r\nThe continuation of the refugee crisis will pose \r\nvital social, political and economic risks for the host \r\nnations, as we have learned bitterly on many occasions. \r\nWe know that civil wars are among the most brutal. We \r\nalso know how they foster radicalism and extremism. \r\nOnce extremist groups take root in a State, they form \r\nautonomous structures and become a real threat to \r\nsecurity, not only at home but also abroad. In the end, \r\ndissolving such organizations presents the greatest \r\nchallenge to restoring security in a country.\r\nWe must be aware of the threat and realize that with \r\neach day we lose in indecision, the more remote the \r\nprospects for a peaceful Syria become. After the Syrian \r\npeople took to the streets against the regime, many \r\ninternational statements were made to support their \r\ncause, strong in their wording and promises. Those \r\nindividual nation. True domestic peace is the key to \r\nregional and international peace and stability That is \r\na challenge that we will continue to face in the years \r\nahead.\r\nWe all know that no one holds a monopoly on \r\nrighteousness, yet I would like to touch upon the \r\nfunction of the whole United Nations system. We all \r\nneed a strong, efficient and credible United Nations. We \r\nneed a United Nations fit for its purpose in confronting \r\ncurrent global realities. The United Nations of which \r\nI speak should be a body capable of taking action to \r\nmaintain international peace and security. It should \r\nbe able to safeguard security, justice and the people’s \r\nfundamental rights and freedoms. It should never forfeit \r\nits prime responsibility for the sake of power politics.\r\nWe must realize that inaction by the Security \r\nCouncil only emboldens aggressive regimes. We need \r\na United Nations capable of forcing the perpetrators of \r\nbrutal actions to submit to justice and the rule of law. \r\nOnly through such a United Nations can we achieve the \r\ntruly peaceful world envisioned by the Organization’s \r\nfounders. Yet as much as that remains a noble goal, it is \r\nalso an urgent necessity. Decisive action is the only way \r\nthat the United Nations system will remain relevant and \r\ncredible. To face that new reality, we need a Security \r\nCouncil that is truly democratic, representative, \r\neffective and accountable.\r\nNo issue facing us is more pressing than the \r\nsituation in Syria. Let me be clear. Turkey welcomes and \r\nfirmly supports the United States-Russian agreement \r\nto eliminate Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons. That \r\nagreement has to be translated into a tangible Security \r\nCouncil resolution. When Syria comes clean about its \r\narsenal, once and for all, it will be a relief for the Syrian \r\npeople and the region. As Syria’s neighbour, Turkey will \r\nappreciate more than most the complete and verifiable \r\ndestruction of those weapons.\r\nNevertheless, we cannot forget that chemical \r\nweapons were used against Syrian civilians only a \r\nmonth ago. The perpetrators of that crime against \r\nhumanity must be held accountable and be brought to \r\njustice. I also see the agreement on Syrian chemical \r\nweapons as an opportunity. I hope it will be a first step \r\nin the formation of a security architecture to ensure the \r\nelimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nYet the recent approach to the situation in Syria \r\nalso raises difficult questions. Were it not for the use of \r\n13-48449 19/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nthe continued expansion of the illegal settlements on \r\nPalestinian land undermines the prospects for a two-\r\nState solution. \r\nThe case for peace is self-evident. We therefore \r\nwelcome and strongly support the talks initiated \r\nbetween the parties under the auspices of the United \r\nStates. The success of future efforts mainly depends \r\non the Israeli Government’s acceptance of the \r\nestablishment of a viable, contiguous Palestinian State. \r\nThere is also a need for the presence of a reconciled and \r\nunified Palestinian front.\r\nThat brings us to another issue upon which our \r\ncredibility rests — the question of Cyprus. Repeated \r\nattempts towards a peaceful settlement have ended in \r\nfailure, including the rejection of the Annan plan in \r\n2004. Turkey, as a guarantor, is fully and sincerely \r\ncommitted to finding a just and negotiated settlement. \r\nWe therefore expect the international community to \r\nurge the Greek Cypriots to reciprocate by engaging in \r\nresult-oriented, time-framed negotiations in good faith. \r\nThose who must solve this question are the Turks and \r\nGreeks of Cyprus. They must start negotiating as soon \r\nas next month, with no ifs or buts. The settlement of the \r\nCyprus question is essential to a stable and peaceful \r\neastern Mediterranean.\r\nFrozen conflicts hinder effective regional \r\ncooperation. We strongly urge peaceful resolution \r\nof the Nagorno Karabakh conflict and achieving \r\nsustainable peace in the Caucasus, based on territorial \r\nintegrity. We have proposed a comprehensive strategy \r\nfor regional economic cooperation and development, \r\ncombined with gradual withdrawal from the occupied \r\nterritories. We believe that can serve as a solid basis for \r\nregional peace.\r\nAnother area where regional cooperation is in high \r\ndemand is the Balkans. In the last few years, Turkey has \r\nbolstered its efforts to build strong ties with all Balkan \r\nnations. Our objective is to create an atmosphere of \r\ndialogue, trust, mutual understanding and conciliation. \r\nWe also have a dependable interest in a secure, \r\nprosperous and peaceful Afghanistan. Here, too, \r\nregional cooperation and ownership is a must. For that \r\nreason, I have personally initiated and led the efforts \r\nto establish the Trilateral Summit process among \r\nAfghanistan, Pakistan and Turkey. Since 2007, it has \r\nproven a real success, and I am confident that more \r\nsuccess will follow.\r\napparent commitments raised the hopes of the Syrian \r\npeople. Yet many nations remained at a comfortable \r\ndistance, disturbed only by the horrible images from \r\nSyria. Meanwhile, the Syrian people’s cries for help \r\nwent unheeded. What could match the Syrian people’s \r\ndisappointment as they suffered the worst massacre of \r\nthe twenty-first century as the international community \r\nsimply looked on.\r\nThat brings me to the question of what needs to \r\nbe done. There has to be a sound strategy with well-\r\ndefined and well-calculated objectives for a peaceful \r\nsolution. It has to aim to end Syria’s civil war, ensuring \r\nthe immediate safety and security of the Syrian people \r\nand the country’s stable transition. The enforcement of \r\nsuch a strategy requires a fully determined, committed \r\nand robust international engagement — exactly what \r\nhas been missing since the beginning of the conflict. \r\nIn short, we cannot and shall not leave the Syrian \r\npeople to their fate. The burden of ending Syria’s \r\nplight now rests on the shoulders of the international \r\ncommunity. Strong words of support must now be \r\nmatched by real deeds. We must be relentless in our \r\nsearch for a new, stable, intact and secure Syria, at \r\npeace with its people and its neighbours. To that end, \r\nwe must devise and enforce a political strategy led by \r\nthe Permanent Five and the neighbouring countries.\r\nFor the last three years, the Middle East has been \r\nexperiencing a remarkable era of social and political \r\nchange. The process of transformation begun in 2010 \r\nmarks the end of the century-old, region-wide status \r\nquo. Of course, there have been and will be waves \r\nof reaction against the changes. Nevertheless, the \r\nadvances in the region, including in Tunisia, Libya and \r\nEgypt, are irreversible. \r\nArab peoples are equally capable of building \r\npluralistic societies. Yet we should not expect the newly \r\nemerging political systems to transform into mature \r\ndemocracies overnight. It is only through slow but \r\nsteady democratic processes that societies will come to \r\nunderstand the value of conciliation. The noble cause \r\nof the Arab peoples deserves our full and unhesitating \r\nsupport.\r\nThe continuation of the Palestinian question for \r\nmore than half a century has inflicted colossal damage \r\non the very concept of justice. The denial of the right \r\nof the Palestinians to have a State of their own has no \r\njustification on any moral, political or legal ground. \r\nDespite insistent calls of the international community, \r\n20/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Turkey for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdullah Gül, President of the Republic of \r\nTurkey, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jonathan: On behalf of the Government \r\nand people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, I salute \r\nthe President as he presides over the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session. I assure him of the full \r\nsupport and cooperation of the Nigerian delegation. I \r\nalso wish to extend our commendation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and to place on record Nigeria’s \r\nappreciation of his focused and committed leadership \r\nof the United Nations system.\r\nThis session comes at a particularly trying period \r\nwhen our world faces a number of critical challenges, \r\nwhich make it imperative for us to work within \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations to address them \r\nmeaningfully. It is therefore apt that the theme for this \r\nsession, “The post-2015 development agenda: setting \r\nthe stage”, signposts our desire and determination to \r\nactively cooperate for the improvement of the overall \r\nwelfare and well-being of the most vulnerable citizens \r\nof the States Members of the Organization.\r\nNigeria appreciates the consultative nature of \r\ndesigning the post-2015 development agenda. Earlier \r\nin the year, we supported this global outreach through \r\ninclusive consultations and surveys of a number of \r\nNigerians, who expressed their aspirations with respect \r\nto the world they expect beyond 2015. A major highlight \r\nof that process, which has increased national ownership \r\nof the agenda, is the emphasis on the eradication of \r\nAnother important issue that affects us all is \r\nterrorism. It is real, extremely dangerous, and a crime \r\nagainst humanity, and it must be defeated. We can defeat \r\nit only when we get rid of “my terrorist/your terrorist” \r\ndistinctions. Effective international partnership against \r\nterrorism remains a key priority for Turkey.\r\nThere is yet another issue that needs our attention. \r\nUnfortunately, Islamophobia has become a new form of \r\nracism. It aims to create an abstract, imaginary enemy \r\nfrom the millions of peace-loving Muslims all over \r\nthe world. It is essential to strike a balance between \r\nprotecting freedom of expression and preserving \r\nrespect for faiths.\r\nThe current challenges of development are \r\nmatters of global concern. Turkey is now runing \r\na comprehensive assistance and direct investment \r\npackage for the world’s least developed countries. \r\nHumanitarian diplomacy is a key objective of Turkish \r\nforeign policy. In fact, Turkey became the fourth-\r\nlargest donor last year. Including the contributions of \r\nTurkish non-governmental organizations in the fields \r\nof health, education, and capacity-building, Turkey’s \r\nhumanitarian assistance totals $2 billion per year. Our \r\nengagement in Somalia is an exemplary case. We have \r\nallocated $300 million so far.\r\nOur approach to Africa is one of equal partnership \r\nand is best captured in the African proverb which \r\nstates, “If you want to go fast, go alone. But if you want \r\nto go far, go together.” For Turkey, relations with Africa \r\nremain a key priority.\r\nTurkey is a candidate for a non-permanent seat \r\non the Security Council for the term 2015-2016. If \r\nelected, Turkey will bring an independent voice to \r\nthe Security Council, one that listens to all and tries \r\nto find comprehensive and lasting solutions through \r\ndialogue. We expect the support of all Members for our \r\ncandidacy. \r\nI believe that the new millennium is one in which \r\ndemocracy, rule of law, respect for human rights and \r\nglobal welfare will continue to expand. I believe that an \r\ninternational peace shaped by freedom, justice, dignity, \r\nsocial progress and economic welfare is within our \r\nreach. We must join our strength to build an enduring \r\ninternational order that is worthy of the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. A stable, secure, and \r\nprosperous world is the best way to secure and advance \r\nall of our interests. Achieving such a world remains our \r\nfundamental responsibility to our nations.\r\n13-48449 21/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nNigeria’s commitment to sustainable peace and \r\nsecurity propels the country to action along with \r\nmember States of our subregional and continental \r\norganizations whenever stability is threatened in \r\nour continent. In recent years, Africa has had its \r\nshare of conflicts, notably in Mali, Guinea-Bissau, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Somalia. It is noteworthy that \r\nAfrican leaders, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, have demonstrated the capacity to work in \r\nconcert and decisively in pursuit of long-term solutions \r\nin the affected States. While a lot more still needs to \r\nbe done, we are convinced that progress is being made.\r\nThe recent presidential elections in Mali herald \r\na new beginning that should translate into peace and \r\nprosperity for its people and provide a stronger basis \r\nfor stability within the subregion. I congratulate \r\nPresident Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who is here with \r\nus today. Similarly, the political transition process in \r\nGuinea-Bissau holds much promise. Among African \r\nleaders, there is a greater determination and focus on \r\nthe transformation of the continent. That is the required \r\nimpetus for the achievement of development objectives \r\nthat will benefit the people, and rebrand the continent \r\neven more positively.\r\nAlthough our world has not witnessed a global \r\nwar since the establishment of the United Nations, \r\nthere have been several conflicts with devastating \r\nconsequences and impact in virtually all regions of \r\nthe world. As global citizens, we have a sacred duty to \r\nfree our world of wars, rivalries, ethnic conflicts and \r\nreligious divisions. Our collective effort in our drive for \r\na better world will continue to bind us together.\r\nNigeria continues to support the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations in addressing the global initiative to \r\ncombat the menace of the illicit trade in small arms and \r\nlight weapons. We have redoubled efforts to address \r\nthis onerous challenge within our borders and across the \r\nWest African subregion. In doing so, we also recognize \r\nthe need for a broad-based global partnership in the \r\nongoing battle against transborder crimes, including \r\nterrorism and acts of piracy. It is regrettable that \r\nthese scourges are sustained by unfettered access by \r\nnon-State actors to illicit small arms and light weapons, \r\nwith which they foster insecurity and instability across \r\nour continent. For us in Africa, these are the weapons \r\nof mass destruction.\r\nIt is therefore in the light of our collective \r\nobligation and unceasing struggle to end this nightmare \r\npoverty as the overarching principle in the formulation \r\nof the successor framework. Tomorrow, Nigeria will host \r\na side event on the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), in collaboration with the \r\nUnited Nations, a number of African countries and our \r\ndevelopment partners.\r\nAs I had cause to say before the Assembly at its \r\nprevious session (see A/67/PV.8), the year 2015 is not \r\na destination but only a milestone to a better, safer, \r\nhealthier and more compassionate world. Let us \r\ntherefore renew our commitment to the processes that \r\nwill develop the post-MDG framework.\r\nThat objective is of particular resonance to us in \r\nAfrica, where the challenges of poverty, illiteracy, \r\nfood insecurity and climate change continue to engage \r\nthe attention of the political leadership. The good \r\nnews, however, is that in the past decade, a sustained \r\ndemocratization process across the continent has \r\nmade significant difference in governance processes, \r\ninstitutions and structures. Today, we have a renascent \r\nAfrica, which has moved away from the era of \r\ndictatorship to a new dawn, where the ideals of good \r\ngovernance and an emphasis on human rights and \r\njustice are beginning to drive State-society relations. \r\nThis is the present reality of Africa that must replace \r\nthe old prejudices and assumptions about the continent.\r\nWe are firm in our conviction that democracy is \r\nfundamental to achieving the requisite stability that \r\nwill enable the realization of a sustainable post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda in Africa. This emergent Africa \r\nwill require the continued support and partnership of the \r\ninternational community — an Africa that is no longer \r\nmerely a destination for aid but one that is involved in \r\nconstructive, multi-sectoral exchanges on the global \r\nstage. Our continent stands ready to continue to engage \r\nthe rest of the world as a partner in formulating a global \r\ndevelopment agenda that will guarantee peace, security \r\nand stability.\r\nI wish to express my appreciation at Nigeria’s \r\nselection as co-Chair of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing. The importance of the Committee’s \r\nassignment cannot be overstated. For the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda to be realistic, it must be backed \r\nby a robust financing framework, which I hope will \r\nreceive the strong backing of the Organization’s better-\r\nendowed Members.\r\n22/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nin the context of States that aspire to such weapons but \r\nalso of the nations already in possession of them. It is \r\nour collective responsibility to urge the international \r\ncommunity to respond to the clarion call for a peaceful \r\nuniverse in an age of uncertainty. We can attain that \r\nobjective if we adopt measures and policies that \r\npromote nuclear disarmament, protect and renew our \r\nenvironment and push towards an international system \r\nthat is based on trust, mutual respect and shared goals.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nI believe that I express the concern of many when \r\nI bring up the slow pace of effort and apparent lack of \r\nprogress in the reform of the United Nations, especially \r\nthe Security Council. We believe strongly that the call \r\nfor democratization worldwide should apply not only \r\nto States but also to international organizations such \r\nas the United Nations. That is why we call for the \r\nCouncil’s democratization. It is desirable in order to \r\nenshrine justice, equity and fairness and to promote a \r\nsense of inclusiveness and balance in our world.\r\nOur support for the Security Council in its primary \r\nresponsibility — the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security — has been total and unwavering. In our \r\nprevious membership of the Council we demonstrated \r\nboth the political will and the capacity to engage in key \r\nCouncil responsibilities. Nigeria has therefore decided \r\nto seek election to a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2014 to 2015, for which I am \r\npleased to be able to say we have been endorsed by the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States and the \r\nAfrican Union. We urge the Assembly to endorse our \r\ncandidature.\r\nOur world continues to be confronted by pressing \r\nproblems and threats. No statement made during this \r\nsession can encompass the extent of those problems. \r\nThe world looks to us, as leaders, to provide hope in \r\nthe midst of crisis, to offer guidance through difficult \r\nsociopolitical divisions and to ensure that we live in \r\na better world. We have obligations to the current \r\ngeneration, but we have a greater obligation to those \r\nyet unborn, who should one day be able to inherit a \r\nworld of sufficiency, irrespective of the circumstances \r\nof their birth or where they stand on the globe. We must \r\nwork to make that world a reality in recognition of our \r\ncommon heritage. We must strive to eradicate poverty, \r\nhunger, disease and human misery; we must eliminate \r\nthe scourge of nuclear, chemical and biological warfare, \r\nas well as that of small arms and light weapons. We \r\nmust dedicate ourselves to working together to address \r\nthat I congratulate Member States on the adoption of \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty in April. Our hope is that, upon \r\nits entry into force, the Treaty will herald an era of \r\naccountable trade in conventional arms, which is critical \r\nto the security of nations. In line with our continued \r\ncommitment to that project, Nigeria has signed and \r\nratified the Treaty. We will continue to engage other \r\nMember States for its successful implementation.\r\nTerrorism constitutes a major threat to global peace \r\nand security and undermines the capacity for sustained \r\ndevelopment. In Nigeria, the threat of terrorism in \r\na few states in the north-eastern part of our country \r\nhas proven to be a challenge to national stability. We \r\nwill spare no effort in addressing this menace. We \r\nare therefore confronting it with every resource at our \r\ndisposal, with due regard for fundamental human rights \r\nand the rule of law. Nigeria would like to place on record \r\nits appreciation to the international community for its \r\nsupport in that regard. The reign of terror anywhere \r\nin the world is an assault on our collective humanity. \r\nThree days ago, the stark reality of that menace was \r\nagain brought to the fore by the dastardly terrorist \r\nattack in Nairobi. We must stand together to win this \r\nwar together.\r\nPiracy, like terrorism, is another menace that has \r\nattained worrying proportions, especially in Africa’s \r\ncoastal waters. At the bilateral and multilateral \r\nlevels, Nigeria has promoted cooperation to mitigate \r\npiracy’s impact on and consequences for the security \r\nand economies of affected coastal States. Indeed, in \r\nJune, the leaders of the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States and the Gulf of Guinea Commission \r\nmet in Yaoundé and came up with practical steps to \r\ncollectively confront the menace of piracy in the Gulf of \r\nGuinea. That effort will no doubt require reinforcement \r\nand wider support and collaborative action on the part \r\nof our international partners.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains volatile. \r\nThe reported use of chemical weapons in the Syrian \r\ncrisis is unacceptable. Nigeria condemns, in the \r\nstrongest possible terms, the use of chemical weapons \r\nprohibited by international conventions. We applaud the \r\ncurrent diplomatic efforts to avert a further escalation \r\nof the crisis. We urge all parties involved to end the \r\nviolence and seek a negotiated solution, including \r\nthrough the instruments of the United Nations.\r\nThe threat that nuclear weapons pose to the \r\nsurvival of the human race is to be understood not just \r\n13-48449 23/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nThat requires many things of us, but none so \r\nimportant as holding an open, free and respectful \r\ndialogue among ourselves, a dialogue that, far from \r\nfearing dissent, values it and is nourished by it, because \r\nit understands that only when the various nations and \r\ncultures join forces will we also see our opportunities \r\nexpand.\r\nWe are living in a world that is very different from \r\nthe one that witnessed the birth of the Organization and \r\nof other agencies such as the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank after the end of the Second \r\nWorld War. This new world is not the result of war or \r\nof the ideological struggles waged during the second \r\nhalf of the twentieth century; rather, it is the child of \r\na revolution in knowledge, science, technology and \r\ninformation that has been taking place for some time \r\nand that is now knocking at our doors and creating \r\nopportunities for material and spiritual progress for \r\nmillions of men and women around the world that many \r\nof us could not have imagined even a few decades ago. \r\nThis new world is no longer divided by walls or iron \r\ncurtains, but is connected and integrated by the bridges \r\nof increasing globalization and the massive exchange of \r\ngoods, services, capital and people. \r\nIn this new world we certainly face dangers, \r\nchallenges and opportunities that are also new, and which \r\nin many cases transcend the borders and jurisdictions \r\nof individual countries, demanding to be tackled by \r\ndistinguishing where the responsibility of some people \r\nends and where the responsibility of others begins. \r\nSuch challenges and problems can be successfully \r\ndealt with only by harnessing the force of the unity of \r\nall and the responsibility of each. However, although \r\nwe know we are living in a world that is undergoing \r\nenormous transformations, many of our international \r\norganizations often seem resistant to the change that \r\nsuch an evolution demands, allowing themselves to fall \r\nbehind instead of leading the process.\r\nArticle 1 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nstates that the principal purposes of the Organization \r\ninclude to maintain international peace and security, \r\nto develop friendly relations among nations and to \r\npromote international cooperation in the economic, \r\nsocial, cultural and humanitarian spheres, as well as \r\nrespect for human rights and the permanent protection \r\nof human freedoms without distinction as to race, sex, \r\nlanguage or religion. But let us be clear. None of those \r\ndesires is exclusive to one nation, one era or one specific \r\norganization: they all emanate from the depths of our \r\nglobal, regional and national challenges and to deliver a \r\nmore peaceful, equitable and prosperous world for all. \r\nIt is our duty. We must not fail.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federal Republic of \r\nNigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sebastián Piñera Echeñique, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Chile \r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile.\r\nMr. Sebastián Piñera Echeñique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sebastián Piñera Echeñique, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Piñera Echeñique (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould first like to congratulate you, Sir, an outstanding \r\npublic servant from our region, on his recent election \r\nto preside over the General Assembly. I would also \r\nlike to express my heartfelt solidarity with the people \r\nand Government of Mexico in the wake of the storms \r\nthat have seriously affected their country, and with \r\nthe people and Government of Kenya, after the acts \r\nof terrorism that have had such a terrible impact. I \r\nwould also like to emphasize that during this period of \r\nmeetings, Heads of State and Government from almost \r\nall corners of the planet will have the opportunity to \r\nexchange views, share experiences and, most important, \r\ngenerate the momentum essential to building together a \r\nfuture commensurate with the ideals, dreams and hopes \r\nof the men and women represented here.\r\nThe fundamental inspiration behind the founding \r\nof the United Nations, almost seven decades ago, was \r\nthe desire to be able to depend on a place designed to \r\nbring into harmony the actions of every nation aimed \r\nat attaining peace and development, a place where all \r\nindividuals, nations and peoples of the world — whatever \r\nf lag they pledge to honour, whatever god they worship \r\nand whatever ideas they embrace — can feel part of one \r\nbig family, the human family.\r\n24/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nour strongest commitment to the principles and values \r\nthat have for decades governed and guided our foreign \r\npolicy. I mention in particular our full, unconditional \r\nrespect for international law, the inviolability of \r\ntreaties, legal equality among States, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the self-determination \r\nof peoples — all values that provide the essential \r\nfoundation for international stability and peaceful \r\ncoexistence among nations. In our opinion, however, \r\nthose values should be complemented by the principle \r\nor notion of the responsibility to protect. That concept \r\nholds that it is the primary duty of each State to protect \r\nthe population within its borders. And if a State cannot \r\nor does not want to comply with that primary duty, then \r\nthe international community can and should intervene \r\non the basis of three universally recognized pillars, \r\nnamely, prevention, support and the proportional use \r\nof force in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations, but only as a last resort and when strictly \r\nessential to prevent, avoid or deter genocide, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing or crimes against humanity.\r\nIn addition, my country once again reaffirms its \r\nstrongest commitment to democracy and respect for the \r\nhuman rights of all persons, from their conception to \r\ntheir natural death, at all times and in all places and \r\nall circumstances, as well as our ongoing endorsement \r\nof multilateralism, of a regionalism that is open to \r\nthe world, and of fair and constructive economic \r\ncompetition among all countries. \r\nIn that regard, we reiterate our appeal not only to \r\nend the proliferation of nuclear arms and weapons of \r\nmass destruction but also to dismantle those that already \r\nexist. We strongly condemn the use of the chemical \r\nweapons in Syria, as well as the indiscriminate use \r\nof force against the civilian population, which has to \r\ndate produced tens of thousands of innocent victims, \r\nincluding women and children, and has caused a \r\nserious humanitarian crisis that represents a wound \r\nto our universal conscience and seriously threatens \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\nWe therefore welcome and strongly support the \r\nframework agreement for the elimination of chemical \r\nweapons in Syria, concluded recently by the United \r\nStates and Russia, as well as the efforts made by the \r\nSecretary-General and the Joint Special Envoy of the \r\nUnited Nations and the League of Arab States to reach \r\na peaceful and lasting solution to this prolonged armed \r\nconflict as soon as possible.\r\nsouls and of each human heart. For that reason, we are \r\nnot here only to proclaim their value and existence \r\nbut to ensure their enforcement and application. We \r\ntherefore appeal not for those values to be changed or, \r\nstill less, to be forgotten. Quite the contrary: we appeal \r\nfor the will and the courage to put them into practice. \r\nIn order to do so, we must perfect our democracies and \r\nstrengthen grassroots participation, but we must also \r\nmodernize our regional and global organizations. In \r\nthat task, as we all know, there is a long road ahead of \r\nus.\r\nA good first step in that direction is to move \r\ntowards real and far-reaching reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, including the enlargement of its permanent \r\nand non-permanent membership to ensure proper \r\nregional representation, as well as to strengthen its \r\ntransparency. working methods and decision-making, \r\nall aimed at enhancing the effectiveness and legitimacy \r\nof its activities.\r\nIn that regard, Chile, which was present at the \r\ncreation of the Organization in 1945, supports the \r\ninclusion of Brazil, Germany, Japan and India as \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, as well as \r\nthe African continent’s request for fair representation \r\nin the Organization. And we join in the appeals to the \r\nfive countries with the right of veto to refrain from \r\nexercising that right in situations of crimes against \r\nhumanity, war crimes, genocide or ethnic cleansing, \r\nsince the use of the veto in such cases prevents or \r\nundermines the Council’s efforts to effectively defend \r\nthe most fundamental values that enable humankine to \r\nadvance. \r\nHowever, Security Council reform is not limited \r\nto changes in its membership and organization. It also \r\nmeans abandoning the logic of vetoes and replacing \r\nit by a logic of special quorums, so that the most \r\nimportant decisions concerning international security, \r\nwhich inevitably affect all countries sooner or later, can \r\nbe adopted in a way that is truly representative of the \r\ncommunity of nations that make up the United Nations. \r\nIn the end, if we advocate democracy, dialogue and \r\nparticipation when we govern our own countries, we \r\nshould advocate for those same principles when we \r\naddress the form in which the United Nations governs \r\nitself. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity also to express \r\nmy gratitude for the many expressions of support for \r\nChile’s candidacy as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council in the next two years and to reaffirm \r\n13-48449 25/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nIn addition, Chile, together with Mexico, Colombia \r\nand Peru, took part in co-founding the Pacific Alliance, \r\none of the most far-reaching integration initiatives in our \r\nregion, designed to promote an area for the free f low of \r\nnot only of goods, services and capital but also of persons, \r\nthus allowing higher growth rates and development and \r\ngreater opportunities for our countries and peoples. We \r\nare delighted to see that the Pacific Alliance, which \r\nrepresents a population of over 210 million, one third \r\nof Latin America’s gross domestic product and more \r\nthan half of its foreign trade, has, despite its recent \r\nemergence, already achieved significant results and is \r\nincreasingly attracting the interest of the international \r\ncommunity, which can be seen in the fact that it has \r\nattracted more than 20 observer countries, including \r\nAustralia, Canada, China, Spain, the United States and \r\nJapan.\r\nLastly, I should like to mention the recent approval \r\nby the National Congress of my country of legislation \r\nsubmitted by the Government that abolishes tariffs on \r\nimports from the least developed countries, as defined by \r\nthe United Nations. That is an important demonstration \r\nof the Chilean people’s solidarity with and commitment \r\nto the development of almost 50 countries in Africa, \r\nAsia, Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nA few days ago, Chileans marked the fortieth \r\nanniversary of the most far-reaching and lasting \r\nupheaval ever to affect our democracy in our two \r\ncenturies of independent life and which ushered in a \r\nperiod characterized by hatred, division and exclusion \r\nnot only in Chile but also in a world torn apart by the \r\nCold War. However, in a few days’ time, on 5 October, \r\nwe shall be marking another anniversary in Chile — the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the start of the peaceful \r\nrecovery of our democracy by the free and sovereign \r\nwill of a vast majority of Chileans, which has allowed \r\nus to recover our democracy in a wise and peaceful \r\nmanner and with the advice and consent of all sectors \r\nof our country. From both experiences, Chileans have \r\nlearned lessons that I should like to share with the \r\nAssembly today because I humbly believe that they can \r\nshed light on how to resolve conflicts that are negatively \r\naffecting other nations of the world today.\r\nThe first lesson is that we must acknowledge \r\nwithout reservations of any kind that even in extreme \r\nsituations, including external or internal warfare, there \r\nare moral and legal rules that must be respected by all \r\nand that can never be ignored without falling into a \r\nserious and unacceptable moral vacuum. Among those \r\nSimilarly, Chile has always defended and will \r\ncontinue to defend the cause and rights of the \r\nPalestinian people to have a full, free and democratic \r\nState — a State that, like the State of Israel, enjoys \r\nagreed, recognized and secure borders with all its \r\nneighbours, allowing its inhabitants to live and develop \r\nin stable and lasting peace and security. We therefore \r\nrecognized Palestine as an observer member of the \r\nUnited Nations and hope very soon to welcome it as a \r\nfull Member of the Organization.\r\nWith regard to regional matters, in March \r\n2012, Chile ratified the Protocol on Commitment to \r\nDemocracy, adopted by the member countries of the \r\nUnion of South American Nations, and we hope that it \r\nwill enter into force as soon as possible. In addition, we \r\nhave reiterated our commitment to the Inter-American \r\nDemocratic Charter and shall work tirelessly for the \r\ncause of democracy, freedom and the full respect for \r\nhuman rights in all the countries on our continent and \r\nthroughout the entire world.\r\nChile has also assumed the presidency pro tempore \r\nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates and hosted the first summit of its 33 members, \r\nat which we signed the Santiago Declaration, in which \r\nthe entire region stated its commitment to democratic \r\nvalues and respect for human rights. In addition, we \r\nheaded the first joint summit of the Heads of State \r\nand Government of Latin America, the Caribbean and \r\nEurope, at which nations on both sides of the Atlantic \r\nOcean undertook to promote sustainable development \r\npolicies in order to encourage high quality investments \r\nof both social and environmental value.\r\nIn the social sphere, although two years still remain \r\nbefore the deadline set at the Millennium Summit, we \r\ncan announce with great satisfaction that Chile has \r\nattained practically all the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) set by the Organization in 2000. We \r\nare nevertheless redoubling our efforts to attain the \r\nremaining goals by 2015, and working to ensure that the \r\ncountries that have requested our help can also achieve \r\nthem. We are also participating actively in the efforts at \r\nthe United Nations to define a new global sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015 that follows on the \r\nMDGs and establishes specific, measurable, bold \r\nand feasible responsibilities, both for developing and \r\ndeveloped nations, with special attention being given \r\nto ensuring that economic development is compatible \r\nwith social development and the protection of the \r\nenvironment.\r\n26/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\ncountry that overcame poverty and became fully \r\nintegrated into the community of democratic and \r\ndeveloped nations. Those are the commitments that the \r\nGovernment that I have the honour to lead made to all \r\nChileans almost four years ago. We are deeply gratified \r\nto observe the solid and sustained progress of Chile \r\ntowards their fulfilment.\r\nDespite the devastating earthquake and tsunami \r\nthat struck us in 2010 — at the time, the fifth most \r\nserious in the known history of humankind — and the \r\nglobal economic crisis that began in 2008 and is not \r\nover, Chile has resumed its leadership, momentum and \r\nability to create jobs and strong growth. For example, \r\nour per capita gross domestic product, which four years \r\nago was about $15,000, now stands at $20,000. Poverty \r\nand inequality are declining and real wages are rising \r\nrapidly. All indicators show that in key spheres such as \r\nquality education and health, we are making progress in \r\nthe right direction, further stimulating innovation and \r\nentrepreneurship and better protecting our consumers, \r\nworkers and the environment. \r\nAt the same time, we have rebuilt virtually 90 per \r\ncent of everything destroyed by the earthquake and \r\ntsunami. Obviously, our Government is very proud \r\nof the contribution that its policies have made to \r\nthe attainment of those goals. But we have no doubt \r\nthat most of the credit goes to all Chileans, men and \r\nwomen, who have made enormous contributions to \r\narrive at this point. If there is something that we \r\nin Chile have learned it is that in order to be able to \r\ngrow and to reduce poverty and excessive inequalities, \r\nnothing works better than to rely on the skills of people \r\nthemselves, expanding their freedoms and unleashing \r\nthe forces of imagination, creativity, innovation and \r\nentrepreneurship that lie within the hearts of each of \r\nmy compatriots and also — I am sure — the hearts of \r\nevery man and woman around the world.\r\nThose are some thoughts and lessons that I, both as \r\nPresident of Chile and as a citizen of the world — wanted \r\nto share with Heads of State and Government. Those \r\nare the lessons and thoughts of a country that may be \r\nsmall on the international stage and remotely located \r\non the world map, but that today enjoys a stable and \r\nconsolidated democracy, broad and guaranteed public \r\nfreedoms and an economic system that, after two \r\ncenturies of republican life, has finally brought us to \r\nthe threshold of development.\r\nrules, there is the strict respect for the human rights of \r\nall, in every time and place, under all circumstances. \r\nThe second lesson is that the values of democracy, \r\npeace and civil amity are much more fragile than we \r\nusually think, so we cannot, and should never, take \r\nthem for granted. They are somewhat like a tree that \r\nneeds to be watered every day in order not to wither and \r\ndry up. Such care must be provided not only in deeds \r\nbut also in words, gestures and formal actions, because \r\nall of them can and must be placed at the service of \r\ntruth, justice, reconciliation and peace. \r\nThe third lesson is that there is a very close \r\nrelationship among the quality of democracy, economic \r\nprogress and social justice, since all of them are mutually \r\nreinforcing and since the decline of one of them would \r\nsooner or later have an adverse effect weakening the \r\nothers. Our task, therefore, is not only to strengthen our \r\ndemocratic institutions but also to promote economic \r\nand social policies based on freedom, responsibility, \r\njustice, equality of opportunity and the fight against \r\npoverty, and based on uniting the forces of both private \r\nand public initiative and respect for fundamental \r\nrights, because such policies are the main engines of \r\ndevelopment of our nations and peoples.\r\nThe fourth lesson that we have learned in our country \r\nis that the past is over. We can discuss it, interpret it \r\nand, of course, remember it, but we cannot change it, \r\nand therefore we have no right to remain prisoner to it, \r\nbecause when the present is anchored in the past, the \r\nonly thing we lose is the future. For that reason, our \r\ngeneration, which is celebrating the bicentennial of our \r\ncountry, has no right to bequeath to future generations \r\nthe same hatreds, quarrels and divisions that caused so \r\nmuch harm and suffering 40 years ago. The challenge, \r\nthen, is not to forget but to overcome the past with a new, \r\npositive and hopeful outlook, trying to learn from past \r\nexperience in order to avoid making the same mistakes \r\nand letting it illuminate the way to the future, and to \r\nface with greater resolve and efficiency the problems \r\nand opportunities of the present and the future.\r\nThose and other lessons painfully learned by Chile \r\nenabled us to recover our democracy peacefully and to \r\nmove forward over the past 25 years on the paths of \r\ntruth, justice and reconciliation among all Chileans. \r\nBut that was an old transition, one that, I believe, we \r\naccomplished successfully. Today we Chileans are \r\nfacing another transition. This is a new, young and \r\nforward-looking transition that, before the end of this \r\ndecade, will allow us to turn Chile into a developed \r\n13-48449 27/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nwars and armed conflicts continue to rage in different \r\nregions and cause thousands of deaths and are leading \r\nto humanitarian crises and human suffering. We also \r\ncontinue to witness violations of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nThe situation in Syria continues to be a major cause \r\nof concern and a risk to regional and global security. \r\nBulgaria strongly condemns the chemical attack on \r\n21 August, which took the lives of thousands of innocent \r\npeople, including many children. The use of chemical \r\nweapons in Syria constitutes a blatant violation of \r\ninternational law, a war crime and a crime against \r\nhumanity. There is strong evidence to substantiate the \r\nassertion that the Syrian regime is responsible for those \r\nattacks, as it is the only party that possesses chemical \r\nagents, weapons and the means of their delivery for an \r\nattack of that scale.\r\nThere can be no impunity, and the perpetrators of \r\nthat heinous attack must be held accountable. Bulgaria, \r\nwhich is one of the signatory countries of a letter urging \r\nthe Security Council to immediately refer the situation \r\nin Syria to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, joins similar calls coming from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights.\r\nMy country welcomes the framework agreement \r\nbetween the United States and the Russian Federation \r\nto place Syria’s chemical weapons arsenal under \r\ninternational control with a view to its swift and \r\nsecure destruction, and joins them in demanding that \r\nthe Syrian regime provide the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons with immediate \r\naccess to inspect any and all sites in Syria. We call on \r\nthe Security Council to unite and shoulder its relevant \r\nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nincluding Chapter VII.\r\nThe use of chemical weapons should not divert \r\nattention from the persistent gross violations of human \r\nrights and continued human suffering. The momentum \r\ncreated should be used to move towards a lasting \r\npolitical solution to the conflict through the resumption \r\nof the Geneva process, with the active involvement of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe worsening humanitarian crisis requires joint \r\ncoordinated action to alleviate the suffering and help \r\nthose in need. Bulgaria has provided humanitarian \r\nassistance to ease the plight of refugees in neighbouring \r\ncountries. Situated not far from the region, my country \r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Chile \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Sebastián Piñera Echeñique, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rossen Plevneliev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Excellency Mr. Rossen Plevneliev, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Bulgaria. \r\nMr. Rossen Plevneliev, President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rossen Plevneliev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Plevneviev: I am truly honoured to \r\naddress this forum. Let me convey my congratulations \r\nto you, Sir, on your election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. Bulgaria welcomes \r\nthe theme you have selected as timely and relevant and \r\nwishes you every success. \r\nA 16 year-old Bulgarian boy, writing a school report \r\non the Millennium Development Goals, compared the \r\nworld’s development model to a colourful carpet in \r\nwhich some colours, threads and stitches were missing, \r\nmaking it look unfinished, patchy and ragged. Indeed, \r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals resembles an unfinished work. Undoubtedly, a \r\nlot has been achieved in the global fight against poverty \r\nand underdevelopment, but progress has been unsteady \r\nand limited. \r\nNowadays it is hard to accept that more than \r\n1 billion people still suffer from extreme poverty \r\nand malnutrition and that basic health services for \r\nmany women and babies remain a remote luxury. \r\nDisparities in wealth distribution, quality of life and \r\npersonal opportunities have become more extreme \r\nacross the globe. Climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation have reached an alarming level and \r\nrequire our urgent collective response. The well-being \r\nof future generations is at risk due to the irrational \r\nmanagement of natural resources. Despite our efforts, \r\n28/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nGovernment of Kenya, but also Iraq, Pakistan and other \r\ncountries where deadly terrorist attacks have occurred.\r\nOn 18 July 2012, a terrorist attack claimed six \r\ninnocent lives at a Bulgarian airport. That incident \r\nchanged Bulgaria forever and is a reminder that the \r\nfight against terrorism is a common cause, on which \r\nthe entire international community must remain united. \r\nWe believe that the perpetrator of that horrendous \r\nterrorist act will be brought to justice soon. Bulgaria is \r\ngrateful for the moral support, solidarity and practical \r\nassistance of other Member States in the investigation \r\nof that horrific crime. The critical role of international \r\ncooperation in this area once again points to the \r\nnecessity of a prompt finalization of the negotiations on \r\na draft comprehensive convention to combat terrorism.\r\nLet us take a look at what Europe has achieved in \r\nthe past century. From a continent in ruins, torn apart \r\nby wars, we, Europeans, have created an area of peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity. Enemies have become friends \r\nand allies, united for a better future for their children. \r\nToday, in the European Union, we have harmonized \r\nregulations and share a single market, all underpinned \r\nby our common values.\r\nThe past 25 years in the history of the Balkans are \r\nanother great example of what can be achieved when \r\nneighbours work together towards a common goal. \r\nBuilding trust, good neighbourly relations, stability \r\nand security in South-Eastern Europe and in the Black \r\nSea region is among Bulgaria’s priorities. My country \r\nremains strongly committed and will continue to \r\nsupport the efforts of our partners from the Western \r\nBalkans to meet the European Union membership \r\ncriteria and take their legitimate place in the united \r\nEuropean family.\r\nThe European Neighbourhood Policy remains one \r\nof the most efficient instruments of the European Union \r\nto deepen cooperation and ensure peace and stability \r\nin the broader region. Bulgaria attaches particular \r\nimportance to the Eastern dimension of the Policy \r\nto enhance relations with countries of the Black Sea \r\nregion and members of the Eastern Partnership.\r\nIf common borders and geographical proximity \r\nmake us neighbours, shared cultural heritage is what \r\nmakes us a family. This year we, the Slavic nations, \r\ncelebrate together the one thousandth one hundred and \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the mission of the holy brothers \r\nCyril and Methodius to Great Moravia. Almost \r\n12 centuries ago, they bestowed upon us the invaluable \r\nis also affected by the daily influx of refugees from \r\nSyria. Despite its financial constraints, the Government \r\nhas adopted an emergency plan and has provided \r\nadditional resources in order to guarantee adequate \r\nassistance, accommodation and services to Syrian \r\nrefugees. We count on the assistance and help provided \r\nby our partners and the humanitarian bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nWe expect that Iran will demonstrate clear political \r\nwill and address the concerns of the international \r\ncommunity by providing credible evidence of the \r\npeaceful nature of its nuclear programme. In that \r\nrespect, Iran’s full cooperation with the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency is of paramount importance. The \r\nGovernment in Tehran must show greater transparency \r\nin its nuclear activities and should fully comply with all \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nBulgaria welcomes the successful adoption of the \r\nArms Trade Treaty to regulate the international trade in \r\nconventional weapons, and looks forward to its prompt \r\nentry into force.\r\nMy country is encouraged by the resumption of \r\nthe direct peace talks between the Government of \r\nIsrael and the Palestinian Authority at the initiative of \r\nSecretary Kerry, the Quartet and the parties concerned. \r\nWe expect both sides to demonstrate perseverance and \r\ncommitment to a peaceful solution, to respect each \r\nother’s legitimate interests and to refrain from unilateral \r\nactions that could undermine the process. Negotiations \r\nare the best way forward towards the ultimate goal, \r\nnamely, a just, comprehensive and lasting solution on \r\nthe basis of the two-State formula.\r\nBulgaria welcomes the appointment of former \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs Nickolay Mladenov as \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General and \r\nthe Head of the United Nations Assistance Mission for \r\nIraq. His mission in Iraq is an important contribution \r\nto the peacebuilding and restoration process in that \r\nfriendly country and to the stability of the region as a \r\nwhole.\r\nBulgaria condemns terrorism as one of the most \r\nhorrific crimes and challenging threats to international \r\npeace and security. Terrorism has no face, no name, no \r\ncolour and no religion. It strikes unexpectedly and scars \r\nthe lives of everyone it touches. Recently, terrorism \r\nstruck again in Nairobi. On behalf of Bulgaria, I \r\nconvey my deepest condolences to the people and the \r\n13-48449 29/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nWe are still a long way from the future we \r\nwant. The Rio de Janeiro Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment outlined a comprehensive agenda for \r\nfurther work to be completed in the three dimensions of \r\nsustainable development. The recently published report \r\nof the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda presents key proposals for \r\ntransformative shifts and a global, people-centred and \r\nplanet-sensitive agenda. Bulgaria is actively engaged \r\nin the negotiation process on the new sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, with a view to achieving a post-2015 \r\nframework that is human rights-driven, builds upon the \r\nachievements of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand integrates poverty eradication and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in a single and coherent process.\r\nThe new universal and legally binding climate \r\nagreement to be signed in 2015 should reinforce the \r\noverarching post-2015 development agenda and speed \r\nup the international community’s efforts to introduce \r\nnew sustainable models for growth.\r\nCulture and education should be accorded their \r\nrightful place in the post-2015 development agenda. In \r\nthat regard, UNESCO’s role is of pivotal importance. \r\nLet me take this opportunity to reiterate Bulgaria’s \r\nstrong support for the re-election of Ms. Irina Bokova \r\nto a second term as Director-General.\r\nI would like also to express Bulgaria’s admiration \r\nfor the work done by UNICEF in the service of the \r\nchildren of the world. Bulgaria highly values the \r\npartnership and policy advice provided by the UNICEF \r\nOffice in Sofia and others worldwide in modernizing \r\nthe national child-protection sector and achieving more \r\nequitable and inclusive child care.\r\nToday we are building the world of tomorrow. \r\nYoung people should be at the heart of those efforts \r\nas active participants, not as bystanders. For Bulgaria, \r\nyoung people are key stakeholders in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nThis year Bulgaria commemorates the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from the \r\ndeath camps during the Second World War, a unique \r\nachievement of Bulgarian civil society. Unfortunately, \r\nour country was in a situation where it could not do \r\nthe same for Jews from northern Greece and parts of \r\nYugoslavia. We deeply mourn their loss as well as that \r\nof all the victims of the Holocaust.\r\nRecently, citizens from different parts of the world, \r\nBulgaria included, have engaged actively in public \r\ngift of the first Slavic alphabet. Bulgaria welcomed the \r\ndisciples Saint Cyril and Methodius and adopted the \r\nCyrillic script, which has helped us to preserve our \r\nnational identity over the centuries.\r\nThis year the international community marks \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the Vienna Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action on human rights. On this \r\noccasion, Bulgaria would like to emphasize its strong \r\nconviction that human rights should remain one of \r\nthe foremost priorities for the United Nations. As a \r\ncandidate for membership in the Human Rights Council \r\nfor the period 2019-2021, Bulgaria will intensify its \r\nefforts in promoting the highest human rights standards \r\nboth domestically and internationally. \r\nWe welcome the convening of the High-level \r\nMeeting on the Realization of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and Other Internationally Agreed \r\nDevelopment Goals for Persons with Disabilities. As \r\na party to the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities and as a member of the bureau of the \r\nConference of States Parties to the Convention in New \r\nYork, my country is strongly engaged in promoting \r\nthe comprehensive and consistent implementation of \r\nthe Convention at all levels, including by engaging \r\ndisabled people’s organizations as an important partner \r\nin disability-inclusive development.\r\nMy country is convinced that the course of \r\nreforms of the United Nations should continue in \r\norder to enhance the efficiency, representativeness and \r\ntransparency of the entire United Nations system. To \r\nmeet the needs of a changing world, the United Nations \r\nshould continuously adapt and improve. That includes \r\na revitalized General Assembly, a strengthened \r\nEconomic and Social Council and a Security Council \r\nthat reflects contemporary realities. As member of the \r\nEastern European regional group, Bulgaria continues to \r\nhold its position as to the need for allotting at least one \r\nadditional non-permanent seat in an enlarged Security \r\nCouncil to the group, given the fact that, in the past \r\n20 years, its membership has more than doubled.\r\nBased on our long-standing engagement with the \r\nprinciples and values of the United Nations, I pledge \r\nthat Bulgaria will be a responsible and reliable partner \r\nshould it be elected as a Security Council non-permanent \r\nmember for the term 2018-2019. We hope that the \r\nMembers of the United Nations will entrust Bulgaria \r\nwith that responsibility, and we stand ready to shoulder \r\nit in a spirit of partnership.\r\n30/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\ncitizens at a shopping mall. We would like to convey our \r\nsolidarity to the people and the Government of Kenya \r\nand to all those who lost their loved ones in the tragedy. \r\nMr. President, we commend you for your wise and \r\nopportune choice of the theme of this session, “The \r\npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, \r\nbased on the goal of creating a better world for us \r\nall. That agenda, like the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), should be based on principles such \r\nas inclusiveness in its approach; national ownership, \r\nwithin the context of its sustainability; and shared \r\nresponsibility among development partners for its \r\nimplementation.\r\nThe theme of this session is the logical outcome \r\nof the decisions emanating from the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, which \r\ngalvanized the ongoing preparatory process for the \r\ndevelopment agenda that will follow the MDGs and is \r\nbased on a multidimensional approach to development.\r\nIn carrying out that agenda, it is important that \r\nwe eradicate, from both our vocabulary and our \r\nattitude, the dichotomy by which an attempt is made \r\nto group the members of the United Nations family, \r\nwhich is all of us, into two categories — the generous \r\nand the deprived — because in this partnership each \r\ncomplements the other with one’s natural and human \r\nblessings. Those that do not contribute financially \r\ncontribute in kind.\r\nIn that context, the inability of a State to meet its \r\ndevelopment targets as conceived and agreed upon in \r\nthis great House represents a collective failure on the \r\npart of the entire international community, because \r\nsuch targets are the shared responsibility of all States. \r\nOtherwise, why would we set international targets that \r\nare later incorporated into national agendas if they are \r\nnot to be met?\r\nOn that basis, we reiterate our appeal for the \r\ncommitments made to be honoured within the context \r\nof the MDGs, because promises must be kept and we \r\nmust not fail to meet the expectations that we have \r\ncreated.\r\nWe would like in particular to commend the \r\nSecretary-General for his initiative in creating the \r\nHigh-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 \r\nDevelopment Agenda. The valuable conclusions and \r\nrecommendations contained in the report of the Panel \r\nconstitute an important reference in the formulation \r\nlife, demanding greater transparency, accountability, \r\ndecency and integrity from their politicians. We in my \r\ncountry believe that this renewed energy on the part of \r\ncivil society deserves to be encouraged and supported. \r\nI firmly believe that safeguarding human dignity is the \r\nultimate goal of the United Nations, as, indeed, of any \r\ngenuine democracy.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Bulgaria \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rossen Plevneliev, President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President \r\nof the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Guebuza (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is always a great \r\nhonour for me to address this magnificent House, \r\nsymbol of equality among States and an irreplaceable \r\nforum of multilateralism that seeks sustainable \r\nsolutions to the growing global challenges.\r\nI join those who spoke before us in congratulating \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this session. We believe that your \r\nvast experience and knowledge will contribute to the \r\nsuccess of our work. We would like to assure you of our \r\nsupport so as to ensure that your mandate is crowned \r\nwith success.\r\nWe also congratulate your predecessor, Mr. Vuk \r\nJeremić, for a job well done during the sixty-seventh \r\nsession, which resulted in the reaffirmation of the role \r\nof the United Nations as an indispensable multilateral \r\nforum.\r\nWe are shocked by the sad news from Kenya \r\nregarding the killing, in an act of terrorism, of innocent \r\n13-48449 31/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nCommunity (SADC). Given its relevance to our \r\ntheme, we would point out that, over the course of a \r\nyear and in close collaboration with other member \r\nStates, the Africa Union, the United Nations and other \r\ninternational partners, we engaged in galvanizing the \r\nprocess of regional integration and in seeking peace \r\nand stability for the region.\r\nWe reiterate our congratulations to Zimbabwe \r\non holding successful elections, whose results were \r\nvalidated by the country’s institutions and endorsed \r\nby SADC and the African Union. All the conditions \r\nhave now been met for the sanctions imposed on that \r\ncountry to be lifted in order to allow for Zimbabwe’s \r\ndevelopment and full participation in the global agenda. \r\nThe stability of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof the Congo continues to be a challenge for our \r\nregion. We would like, once again, to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General for his efforts — in conjunction \r\nwith SADC, the International Conference on the Great \r\nLakes Region and the African Union — which resulted \r\nin the signing of the Peace, Security and Cooperation \r\nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the Region and in the appointment of President \r\nMary Robinson as the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, whom we also congratulate. We reiterate \r\nour appeal to all signatories to honour the tenets of \r\nthat agreement. We appeal to the Congolese actors to \r\nconclude the Kampala negotiations so as to ensure the \r\nreturn of lasting stability in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of the Congo. \r\nThe establishment of dates for the presidential and \r\nlegislative elections this year in Madagascar creates \r\ngood prospects for the conclusion of the political \r\ntransition process in that country. We must therefore \r\ncontinue to provide our support to ensure that this \r\nprocess is successful.\r\nWithin the framework of our chairmanship of \r\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \r\nwe remain steadfast and committed to the stability of \r\nGuinea-Bissau. We welcome the efforts of the Guinea-\r\nBissau political actors to restore stability to their \r\ncountry. We also commend other partners of Guinea-\r\nBissau — including the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States, the African Union, the European Union \r\nand the United Nations — which have contributed to \r\nthe creation of a new dynamic that seeks to find lasting \r\nsolutions to the political crisis. We also welcome the \r\nappointment of President Ramos-Horta as Special \r\nand negotiation of the development agenda that is to \r\nfollow the MDGs.\r\nMozambique had the privilege of being part of \r\nthe group of countries chosen to carry out a national \r\nconsultation on the post-2015 development agenda. The \r\ntrust shown in Mozambican civil society to drive that \r\nprocess must be commended because it strengthened \r\nthe principle of national ownership of the process. It \r\nalso created the conditions for Mozambican social \r\nactors to demonstrate their growing vitality, which is \r\nin itself a true reflection of the consolidation of the \r\nprocesses of democratic and inclusive governance in \r\nour country.\r\nIndeed, we have been furthering our democracy, \r\nreinforcing our democratic institutions and \r\nconsolidating our democratic practices. We do so \r\nthrough transparency, dialogue and participation, \r\ninstilling respect for the Constitution and broadening \r\ninclusiveness to encourage more Mozambicans to \r\nbecome involved in the fight against poverty. An open \r\nand inclusive presidency and a governance mechanism \r\nreplicated at other levels lead us, on the one hand, to \r\ninteract in a direct and comprehensive way with our \r\npeople in the places where they live and fight against \r\npoverty and, on the other hand, places our governing \r\nmethod under the scrutiny of the people.\r\nIt is in the context of our commitment to democratic \r\nprinciples and values and to abiding by the legal tenets \r\nof our Constitution and laws that, on 20 November, we \r\nwill hold municipal elections for the fourth time and, \r\nin 2014, our fifth general and multiparty elections. The \r\nimplementation of this electoral cycle is the pinnacle \r\nof the exercise of freedom of choice and of citizens’ \r\npolitical participation in the democratic process.\r\nIn the context of our commitment to the \r\ndisarmament agenda — an issue of paramount \r\nimportance in promoting peace and fighting poverty \r\nin Mozambique — and as a way for us to associate \r\nourselves with the cause of international peace and \r\nsecurity, we will host, from 29 June to 4 July 2014, the \r\nThird International Review Conference of the States \r\nParties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel \r\nMines and on Their Destruction. We invite all Member \r\nStates, observers and international and civil society \r\norganizations to participate in the Conference.\r\nIn August, Mozambique successfully concluded its \r\nmandate as Chair of the Southern African Development \r\n32/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nMr. Armando Emílio Guebuza, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. François Hollande, President of the \r\nFrench Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the French Republic. \r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. François Hollande, President of \r\nthe French Republic, and invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Hollande (spoke in French): It is an \r\nhonour for the United Nations to act everywhere where \r\nthe freedom of peoples is denied. It is an honour for \r\nthe United Nations to act where fundamental rights are \r\ncompromised. It is an honour for the United Nations to \r\nintervene where extremism threatens the security of the \r\nworld. It is an honour for the United Nations to act on \r\nbehalf of peace.\r\nIn Syria, the situation is becoming urgent because \r\n120,000 people have died over the past two and a half \r\nyears — 90,000 in the past year alone. One-fourth of \r\nthe population is displaced. Millions of Syrians have \r\nbecome refugees and the country has been destroyed. \r\nThe worst happened on 21 August in Damascus, \r\nwhen chemical weapons were used against civilians, \r\nincluding women and children. United Nations \r\ninspectors, sent officially on behalf of the Organization \r\nhave, established unequivocally and with certainty the \r\nuse of these weapons. \r\nIn the face of this horrifying crime, France sought a \r\nstrong reaction to punish this violation of international \r\nlaw and to dissuade Bashir Al-Assad’s regime from \r\ncommitting new massacres. This pressure exerted by \r\nmy country, along with others, in particular the United \r\nStates, has seen some initial results. Negotiations are \r\nunder way as we speak to ensure the verification and \r\ndestruction of Syria’s chemical weapons. \r\nHowever, if these negotiations are to attain their \r\nultimate end, I have set out three requirements. The \r\nfirst is that any text must clearly make it possible for \r\nthe Security Council to become seized of this issue of \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General and Head of \r\nMission for the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \r\nOffice in Guinea Bissau. We reiterate our appeal to the \r\ninternational community to continue to mobilize the \r\nresources needed to fundamental elections and, above \r\nall, to strengthen State institutions in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nThe agenda of this session focuses on development, \r\nthe successful implementation of which can occur only \r\nin a climate of international of peace and security. In \r\nseeking solutions to the conflicts in different parts \r\nof the world, the multilateral approach, based on the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, must \r\nprevail. Safeguarding world peace will always be our \r\ncollective responsibility and never that of one country \r\nor of group of States. In that context, the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly of the Security Council, \r\nmust continue to receive our special attention so as to \r\nensure that that organ is more representative, democratic \r\nand credible and that it can respond more effectively to \r\nthe various challenges of the contemporary world.\r\nIt will always be a paradox that whenever social, \r\nenvironmental and economic issues arise, all countries \r\nunderstand that multilateral cooperation is a mechanism \r\nthat cannot be avoided, but that decisions involving \r\npeace or war tend to be made behind closed doors by a \r\nsmall group of States. At a time in which concepts such \r\nas democracy, inclusion, ownership and transparency \r\nenjoy renewed prominence, we must all accept that \r\nthe time has come to balance the imbalances that are \r\ncontrary to multilateralism. \r\nIt is in the context of this overall framework that \r\nthe Republic of Mozambique maintains its support for \r\nthe self-determination of the Palestinian people, the \r\nexistence of a Palestinian State based on the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the two-State solution \r\nin which Palestine and Israel live side by side and in \r\nan environment of peace and security. We further \r\nsupport the self-determination of the Saharawi people. \r\nMoreover, the Republic of Mozambique reaffirms the \r\nneed to end economic trade and financial embargos \r\nagainst Cuba. \r\nOnce again, we reiterate our commitment to the \r\nnoble ideals of the United Nations and reaffirm that we \r\nwill continue to do our part in building an increasingly \r\nbetter, more stable and prosperous world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique for the statement he has just made. \r\n13-48449 33/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nThe first is the resumption of negotiations between \r\nthe Israelis and the Palestinians. Only that will enable \r\npeace to be achieved. It requires the coexistence of \r\ntwo States, both with safe and recognized borders. \r\nWe must do everything to ensure that the opportunity \r\nthat now exists for Israelis, Palestinians and the entire \r\nregion is seized to finally bring an end to a conflict that \r\nwhose regional and international repercussions are well \r\nknown to us all. Negotiating peace between Israel and \r\nPalestine would be an historic act.\r\nThe second glimmer of hope is found in the \r\nstatements of the new Iranian President, which reflect \r\nan evolution. I will not exaggerate them, but the question \r\nnow is to know whether those words will be translated \r\ninto actions, in particular concerning the nuclear \r\nissue. For the past 10 years, our discussions have not \r\nprogressed, leading the the international community \r\nto adopt increasingly severe sanctions. The situation \r\nis dangerous, as we all know. Therefore, France \r\nexpects from Iran concrete gestures reflecting that \r\ncountry’s renunciation its military nuclear programme, \r\nalthough it clearly retains the right to pursue its civilian \r\nprogramme. That is why I have chosen to engage in \r\ndirect and open dialogue with President Rouhani. I will \r\nalso say from this rostrum that while I am in favour of \r\ndialogue, I remain firm on the serious issue of nuclear \r\nproliferation.\r\nThe Middle East is not the only region of the \r\nworld that is of concern to us. Africa has fallen prey to \r\nterrorism, and the barbaric attack in Nairobi confirms \r\nthat to us once again, tragically. Victories are possible \r\nagainst terrorism. In Mali, with the clear mandate of \r\nthe Security Council, African and French forces, with \r\nthe support of Europe, intervened in response to the \r\nappeal of the authorities in Bamako and brought an end \r\nto a broad terrorist offensive. Today we see the results. \r\nMali has regained its territorial integrity. It has ensured \r\nthe security of its population, and it has even been able \r\nto hold, on the scheduled date, a presidential election \r\nthat has been recognized as incontestable. I welcome \r\nthe new President of Mali, Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Кeita. \r\nHis election is evidence of a great victory for West \r\nAfrica against terrorism.\r\nHowever, the threat continues to weigh heavily on \r\nthe Sahel and in Libya, where weapons are uniquitous \r\nand where terrorist groups have found refuge. We must \r\nassist the Libyan authorities to ensure the security \r\nof their territory and of their population. France is \r\nprepared to do so.\r\nchemical weapons at any given moment. The second \r\nrequirement is that the draft resolution we are preparing \r\nprovides for coercive measures under Chapter VII in \r\nthe event that the Syrian regime fails to respect its \r\ncommitments. Since the agreement signed between the \r\nUnited States and Russia has the same provision, that is \r\nall the more reason to include it in the draft resolution. \r\nThe third requirement is that those who have committed \r\nthese crimes must be held accountable before justice. \r\nBut we cannot limit ourselves to this draft \r\nresolution, which must be adopted soon. We must \r\nend this war, the deadliest since the beginning of the \r\ncentury. The solution is political. Too much time has \r\nbeen squandered, and I will not refer again to the \r\nblocking of action in the Security Council. During this \r\nperiod, not only has the regime increased its violence, \r\nbut terrorist groups have also taken advantage of the \r\ninternational community’s inertia, to the detriment of \r\nthe democratic forces found within the Syrian National \r\nCoalition. \r\nThis is why the “Geneva II” conference must be \r\nheld as soon as possible. For France, however, Geneva \r\nII is not just a talk shop. It must be a conference to \r\ndefine the objective for putting in place a transitional \r\nGovernment with full executive powers, mandated to \r\nre-establish civil peace, to protect all communities and \r\nto organize elections in due time. I am sometimes asked \r\nabout participants in this conference. My response is \r\nsimple. All countries — and I repeat, all countries — that \r\naccept the goal of installing a transitional Government \r\nand clearly acknowledge their commitment to a political \r\nsolution will be welcome at the conference. \r\nOf equal urgency is the humanitarian situation. In \r\nSyria, the displaced are in the millions, and there are \r\nnow more than 1.5 million refugees in Turkey, Jordan \r\nand Lebanon. The prolongation of the crisis poses \r\na direct threat to the unity and security of Lebanon, \r\nnearly 20 per cent of whose population is now of Syrian \r\norigin. \r\nI would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for having organized the first meeting of the \r\nInternational Support Group for Lebanon. France is \r\ncommitted to that country because we know how much \r\nit has suffered in recent years from disturbances in the \r\nMiddle East and how much it needs to be supported \r\ntoday in its efforts to host refugees.\r\nThere are serious concerns in that part of the \r\nMiddle East, but there are also glimmers of hope. \r\n34/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nto increase that tax by a further 10 per cent to enhance \r\nour fight against the great pandemics: HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria. With Europe, France has \r\nalso established a tax on financial transactions. I have \r\ndecided to allocate 10 per cent of that income towards \r\nsuch development-related actions as access to water \r\nand renewable energy, because with development \r\nassistance we can help the poorest countries to ensure \r\ntheir future, and thereby their security, and to respond \r\nto global warming, which concerns us all.\r\nFrance is available to host the 2015 climate \r\nconference. This matter, too, respresents a threat to \r\nour own security, because one report after another \r\nstates that if we do nothing, by the end of this century \r\nthe temperature of the planet will have increased by \r\nthree or four degrees Centigrade, with the well-known \r\nconsequences of f looding in some places, droughts in \r\nothers. Those direct threats would in turn endanger \r\npeace throughout the world. We must therefore seek an \r\nagreement at the 2015 climate conference.\r\nThe foundations of the commitment are well known. \r\nThe agreement must be equitable. Each country must do \r\nits part. The developed countries obviously must make \r\nhe greatest effort. Emerging countries must protect their \r\ndevelopment, but they must also understand that they \r\nare directly threatened by global warming. The least \r\ndeveloped countries, those that are the most fragile and \r\nvulnerable, must be aided in the transition. That is the \r\npurpose of the fund that was created in Durbin. The \r\nagreement must also be binding; it cannot simply be a \r\nreiteration of principles. It cannot simply be wording in \r\nresolutions that are not translated into concrete actions. \r\nIf there is no assessment and there are no sanctions, \r\nthere will be no progress and global temperature will \r\ninexorably rise.\r\nMy message is simple. In any domain, whether \r\ninternational security, nuclear proliferation, \r\ndevelopment or climate change, the worst threat is \r\ninaction, the worst decision is to take no decision, \r\nand the worst danger is to not see any. And the United \r\nNations bears the responsibility to act. Each time the \r\nOrganization appears powerless, peace is the first \r\nvictim. That is why I am proposing that the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council define a code of \r\nconduct such that in cases of mass crimes, they may \r\ncollectively decide to renounce the right of veto.\r\nIt is also my hope to see the Secretary-General’s \r\npowers of inquiry strengthened to enable the United \r\nNations to ensure — as it has done in Syria — that \r\nI would like to sound an alarm, as I did last year \r\nwith respect to Mali. The warning here is about the \r\nCentral African Republic — a small country that has \r\nbeen ravaged by coups and conflicts for years. Today, \r\nchaos has taken root and civilians are yet again its \r\nvictims. We must bring an end to the abuse, which is \r\nalso sectarian in nature. That is why I would like the \r\nSecurity Council to issue a mandate and provide the \r\nlogistical and financial means to create an African \r\nforce, with its first mission to re-establish stability in \r\nthe Central African Republic.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, women \r\nand children are victims of violence every day in the \r\nKivu region. Again, it is essential that we continue \r\nto strengthen the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, to implement the Addis Ababa agreement, and \r\nto reject all external interference.\r\nWe must learn from the experience of recent years. \r\nEverywhere chaos reigns, terrorism takes root and \r\ngrows. That is the case in Somalia, and the horrific \r\nattack against Kenya reminds us that Al-Shaabab-\r\naffiliated groups, while they have been defeated, have \r\nnot yet been eradicated. That is why the international \r\ncommunity must help African States to protect \r\nthemselves.\r\nFrance will convene, late this year, a meeting on \r\npeace and security in Africa. France has invited all \r\nAfrican countries; Europe will be represented, as will \r\nthe United Nations. The purpose of the meeting is to \r\nenable the establishment, training and equipping of \r\nAfrican armies to ensure the security of the continent \r\nand combat all traffickers, particularly drug traffickers, \r\nand piracy. Africans themselves must ensure their \r\nsecurity, but we cannot leave them to face the terrorist \r\nthreat alone. \r\nThe best weapons we have are our development \r\npolicies, because poverty, unemployment and inequality \r\nprovide fertile soil for violence and insecurity. Again, \r\nFrance calls for the mobilization of the international \r\ncommunity through new funds that we must create to \r\nfinance the necessary infrastructures and to enable \r\naccess to essential public services.\r\nFrance is fighting, along with Europe, for the \r\nintroduction of innovative financing. My country’s tax \r\non airline tickets, which helps finance the International \r\nDrug Purchase Facility (UNITAID), has brought in \r\nmore than €1 billion since 2006. My country has decided \r\n13-48449 35/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nmust respond. The Syrian crisis is a global humanitarian \r\nand security disaster. Escalating violence threatens \r\nto hollow out the rest of that country’s economic and \r\npolitical future. Extremists have rushed to promote and \r\nexploit ethnic and religious divisions. Such a dynamic \r\ncould crush regional renaissance and put global security \r\nat risk. We have a duty to reject those destructive forces.\r\nLast month, Jordan hosted more than 100 eminent \r\nMuslim scholars from around the world. Their work \r\naffirms the true teachings of Islam and builds on \r\nJordan’s long-standing interfaith and intra-religious \r\ninitiatives: the Amman Message, A Common Word, \r\nand World Interfaith Harmony Week. \r\nThe scholars said that there was no single prescribed \r\nmodel for an Islamic State, but they affirmed that the \r\nmodern Islamic State should be a civic State, founded \r\non institutions and with an inclusive constitution based \r\non the rule of law, justice and freedom of opinion \r\nand faith. The modern Islamic State should uphold \r\nequality across the ethnic and religious spectrum. \r\nThe scholars decisively condemned the incitement of \r\nethnic and sectarian conflict, known in Arabic as fitna. \r\nThey recognized that evil for what it is — a threat \r\nto the Muslim world, the Ummah, and indeed to all \r\nhumankind. Jordan has called upon the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation to adopt those recommendations, \r\nwhich are critical guiding principles amid the turbulence \r\nand transformations across our region.\r\nThis month, we in Jordan also convened an \r\ninternational meeting to address challenges to Arab \r\nChristian communities. They are an essential part of \r\nour region’s past, present and future. Jordan has been \r\na historic model of coexistence and fraternity between \r\nMuslims and Christians. We will continue to do our \r\nutmost to protect our Arab Christian communities and \r\nminorities, and we call on all countries to join us in our \r\nstand for diversity, tolerance and mutual respect.\r\nThe truth is that respect for each other is the way \r\nforward for all of us. The historic transformation \r\ngoing on in my region today will not be achieved by \r\nformulas; it will come when all of our citizens feel \r\ntruly represented. Jordan seeks a house of the future \r\nthat includes all. We are building our future on the solid \r\nfoundation of majority consensus, minority rights, a \r\ndemocratic culture of active citizenship and peaceful, \r\nevolutionary change.\r\nThe Syrian people must also have a future. And \r\nfor that, the international community must act. It is \r\nthe truth is established in all instances, carry out \r\ninvestigations and act on the results. The Assembly has \r\nthe sovereign right to take such a decision. Our credibility \r\ndepends upon our capacity to intervene quickly and \r\neffectively in ensuring respect for international law, \r\npunishing violations and promoting development to \r\npreserve future generations. Our legitimacy f lows \r\nfrom the Charter of the United Nations. We must be \r\nworthy of it. Within that framework, France will always \r\nassume its responsibilities in all domains.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the French Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin \r\nAl Hussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom  \r\nof Jordan \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the King of the Hashemite Kingdom \r\nof Jordan.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, \r\nKing of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\nKing Abdullah: It is an honour to join the Assembly \r\ntoday. I congratulate President Ashe on his election and \r\nsincerely thank the Secretary-General for his always \r\ninvaluable work.\r\nGlobal security will long be shaped by what is \r\nhappening right now in the Middle East. Our region can \r\nbe and must be a house of peace and prosperity, with \r\nstrong pillars of good governance and wide-open doors \r\nto opportunity, especially for our young people. That is \r\nJordan’s blueprint, and we are not alone.\r\nBut no house can be built when its city is burning. \r\nAnd today, the region’s fires cannot be ignored. All the \r\nworld is in their path. To protect the future, our world \r\n36/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nno continued settlement construction and no unilateral \r\nactions that threaten the status quo in East Jerusalem \r\nand its Muslim and Christian holy sites. Such threats \r\nwould be a f lashpoint for global concern.\r\nWe know the right way forward. And the goal \r\ncan be reached. It includes a just and final two-State \r\nsettlement, based on international legitimacy and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative; for Israel, real security and \r\nnormal relations with 57 Arab and Muslim countries; \r\nfor the Palestinian people, at long last, the rights they \r\ndeserve in a viable and independent Palestinian State \r\non Palestinian national soil, based on the 1967 lines and \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nLet us keep the focus on what we are \r\nbuilding — communities safe for families to lead \r\nnormal lives; a Middle East of many houses, working \r\ntogether in region-wide cooperation; the ultimate \r\nsecurity for our future.\r\nThe future is ours to build, not in the Middle \r\nEast alone, but in global partnership. Those who are \r\nworking to do the right thing need the whole world’s \r\nsupport. With every country that is more prosperous \r\nand free, with every neighbourhood that is safer, with \r\nevery person who has more reason to hope, the entire \r\nhouse of humankind grows more secure. Let this be our \r\npromise, not only for future generations, but for those \r\nwe serve today.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan for the statement he has just made.\r\nKing Abdullah II Bin Al Hussein, King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the \r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ivan Gašparovič, President \r\nof the Slovak Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\ntime to fast-track a political transition in Syria, end \r\nthe violence and bloodshed, neutralize the threat of \r\nchemical weapons, restore security and stability, \r\npreserve the unity of Syria and its territorial integrity, \r\nand engage all — all — of its people in building their \r\ncountry’s future.\r\nSyria’s future will depend on the Syrian people, but \r\nthe world has the duty, the interest and the power to help. \r\nAnd help must come soon. The damage and dangers \r\nare mounting. The f low of Syrian refugees into Jordan \r\nalready equals one-tenth of our own population. It could \r\nreach 1 million, some 20 per cent of our population, by \r\nnext year. These are not just numbers; they are people \r\nwho need food, water, shelter, sanitation, electricity, \r\nhealth care and more. \r\nNot even the strongest global economies could \r\nabsorb such demand on infrastructure and resources, \r\nlet alone a small economy and the fourth water-poorest \r\ncountry in the world. Jordanians have opened their arms \r\nto those in need, as we have always done, but I say here \r\nand now that my people cannot be asked to shoulder the \r\nburden of what is a regional and global challenge.\r\nLet me acknowledge, with gratitude, the generous \r\nresponse to date by the United Nations and regional and \r\ninternational donors. But we can all see the reality on \r\nthe ground; the need is outracing the response. More \r\nsupport is urgently needed to send a strong signal that \r\nthe world community stands shoulder to shoulder with \r\nthose who have borne so much. Those who are suffering \r\nin Syria also need the world to be resolute: the Syrian \r\nparties must abide by international humanitarian law \r\nand principles, and allow humanitarian access, into and \r\nwithin Syria, to reach those in need.\r\nOur international community must also work \r\ntogether for a speedy resolution of the region’s core \r\ncrisis. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict consumes \r\nresources that are needed to build a better future and \r\nfeeds the f lames of extremism around the world. It is \r\ntime to put this fire out.\r\nThe talks that began in July show that progress \r\ncan be made, with willing parties, determined United \r\nStates leadership and strong regional and international \r\nbacking. We commend the President of Palestine and \r\nthe Prime Minister of Israel for the bold decision to \r\nresume final status negotiations. We urge them to \r\nstay committed to reaching an agreement within the \r\nestablished time frame. Let there be no actions that \r\ncan derail what is still a fragile process. This means \r\n13-48449 37/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nweapons on principle as a crime against humanity \r\nand requests urgently that the perpetrators be brought \r\nbefore the International Criminal Court. Continued \r\nengagement on the part of the United Nations is \r\nessential, since there is no functioning alternative to \r\nits role.\r\nOur recent experience in addressing international \r\nand national crises and conflicts in various regions of the \r\nworld, including the so-called Arab spring, encourages \r\nus to be extremely cautious when considering action \r\nby the international community. The analysis of the \r\nconsequences of such action must be at least as detailed \r\nand elaborate as that of how to conduct a potential \r\nintervention.\r\nSlovakia’s involvement in international crisis \r\nmanagement and in building and maintaining \r\npeace, stability and prosperity has long focused on \r\nAfghanistan, where the Slovak Republic has provided \r\nmilitary as well as civilian and humanitarian aid. We \r\ngreatly appreciate the work done by the United Nations \r\nAssistance Mission in Afghanistan and its challenging \r\nrole in assisting the Afghan Government with its \r\nsecurity, political and economic transition. \r\nIndeed, security, economic development, good \r\ngovernance, the protection of human rights for all and, \r\nlast but not least, the preparation and organization of \r\nfree elections, must be the founding pillars in building \r\na new Afghan State. The upcoming presidential \r\nelection will be a milestone in Afghanistan’s history. \r\nThe key to success of all these processes, even beyond \r\n2014, is national reconciliation, based on the principles \r\nof constitutionality and respect for human rights. \r\nAfghanistan needs consistent, predictable and targeted \r\nsupport and assistance both from its neighbours and \r\nthe entire international community. We consider \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations pivotal in that regard.\r\nAfrica remains a vulnerable continent with a high \r\nconcentration of conflicts. We believe that it will be \r\nable to make progress towards stability, prosperity and \r\ngreater cooperation in a sustainable manner, with help \r\nfrom the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nsuch as the African Union. The 50 years of the African \r\nUnion’s existence have contributed to increased \r\ncooperation and development throughout the continent, \r\nand I believe it will stay on that path. Preventing \r\nconflicts and resolving their primary causes are long \r\nand complex processes. Africa still needs attention and \r\nPresident Gašparovič (spoke in Slovak; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): To address \r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of Slovak citizens is \r\na great responsibility. It is a great responsibility for all \r\nof us who have been entrusted with such a mandate by \r\nour citizens. They rightly expect that this unique global \r\nOrganization will seek and find effective solutions \r\nto bring greater peace, stability and prosperity to \r\nhumankind.\r\nI believe that with President Ashe’s experience we \r\nwill succeed in that task. I wish to thank his predecessor, \r\nMr. Vuk Jeremić, for the vigour with which he presided \r\nover the General Assembly at its last session. I convey \r\nmy deepest respect to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwhose foresight and impartial service epitomize the \r\nvalues of the Organization.\r\nWe have been going through a period of controversial \r\nchanges and unperceived opportunities, as well as \r\nunprecedented challenges. The one thing that remains \r\nunchanged, however, is the power of our joint efforts \r\nand cooperation. Thrown off balance, the world expects \r\nthat we will assume responsibility for taking resolute \r\naction together and on behalf of humanity, not governed \r\nsolely by our narrow national or corporate interests. \r\nThe time has come to learn to respect our diversity \r\nand become in truth the United Nations. Achieving the \r\ntwo primary goals of this Organization — peace and \r\nprosperity for all — remains our greatest challenge and \r\nour primary responsibility. Effective multilateralism is \r\ntherefore in the national interest of us all.\r\nOur resolve and ability to respond effectively are \r\nbeing tested by the current Syrian crisis. The conflict \r\nthreatens the entire region. It is frightening not only \r\nbecause of the number of casualties and refugees; what \r\nis equally alarming is the inability of the Security \r\nCouncil to take any effective action. Thoughtful \r\nreflection on all the possible consequences of a military \r\nintervention in Syria makes it clear that there is only \r\none good solution to this conflict, the diplomatic one. \r\nWe must not be afraid to choose compromise solutions \r\nthat could serve as a basis for positive resolution of the \r\nproblem in the future. \r\nThe United Nations plays a key role in ensuring that \r\ncivilians have access to humanitarian aid, and that those \r\nwho commit crimes against humanity are punished and, \r\nabove all, in enforcing a truce and launching talks on \r\nstable post-conflict arrangements under the “Geneva \r\nII” initiative. Slovakia condemns the use of chemical \r\n38/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nthe security/rule of law/development structure. If we \r\ncannot give people security, safety, education and jobs, \r\nthey will be quick to draw guns again in desperation. \r\nUnfortunately, experience offers proof of that. Slovakia \r\nclosely cooperates with the United Nations in building \r\nthe effective and adequate capacity essential to \r\nsecurity sector reform and emphasizing national and \r\nlocal ownership of all processes. The United Nations \r\nis a guarantor of an impartial system of support to its \r\nmembers in that area.\r\nEnduring peace requires respect for freedom, \r\ndemocracy, the rule of law and human rights. The \r\nculture of impunity has no place in today’s world. \r\nThe role of the International Criminal Court in the \r\nmultilateral system is irreplaceable in that regard, as \r\nit focuses on preventing the perpetrators of the most \r\nserious crimes from going unpunished. But its decisions \r\nmust be unquestionable. The Slovak Republic welcomed \r\nthe adoption of amendments to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in June 2010. Therefore, \r\nwe call on all United Nations Members that have not yet \r\ndone so to ratify the Rome Statute and its amendments.\r\nThis year, we celebrate the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the World Conference on Human Rights and the \r\nadoption of the Vienna Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action. Those historic documents are still relevant \r\nand represent a priority objective that the activities \r\nof the international community should pursue. They \r\nconfirm that the universal nature of all human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms is beyond question. At the \r\nsame time, they emphasize the interconnection between \r\npeace and security, economic and social development, \r\nand respect for human rights.\r\nThere can be no peace without economic stability \r\nand prosperity. Ensuring sustainable development and \r\nsocial stability is beyond doubt the most effective way \r\nto prevent conflicts. That is an agenda in which the \r\nUnited Nations has enormous potential; however, it is \r\none of the most fragmented within the United Nations \r\nsystem. We appreciate that this issue is among the key \r\npriorities of the current session.\r\nIts relevance is also evident in a series of important \r\nside events that focus on meeting the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the development agenda in \r\ngeneral. We particularly appreciate the initiative of \r\nthe General Assembly in organizing the High-level \r\nMeeting on Disability and Development with the aim \r\nof ensuring the inclusion of people with disabilities \r\nassistance from the international community, with a \r\nfocus on preventive diplomacy and national ownership \r\nof all processes. The Slovak Republic supports more \r\nintensive cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union, as well as closer relations between \r\nthe African Union and the European Union.\r\nWe continue to pay close attention to the security \r\nsituation in the Middle East. We are glad to see some \r\npositive signals among the worrying news from this \r\npart of the world. Slovakia welcomes and supports \r\nthe renewal of talks between Israel and Palestine. It \r\nseems, however, that talks are not enough. A number of \r\nbinding agreements and resolutions have been agreed \r\non to date in order to resolve numerous issues, but they \r\nhave not been sufficiently complied with. We therefore \r\nexpect more in the way of implementation of agreed \r\nsolutions. That is vital to peace, security, stability and \r\nfurther development in the entire region.\r\nTerrorism remains one of the most serious threats to \r\npeace and security. It plays a key role in many conflicts \r\nand most of its victims are civilians. We should keep \r\nour resolve to do everything to reach an agreement on \r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\nWe will find a solution only through joint efforts under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations.\r\nWe cannot have a secure, safe and stable environment \r\nwithout effective arms control and disarmament \r\nprocedures in place as the basic instrument for conflict \r\nprevention. The signing of the Arms Trade Treaty has \r\nshown that the United Nations has the potential to \r\nmake history and contribute substantively to greater \r\nsecurity in the world through its shared commitment \r\nto a responsible approach to arms trading. Slovakia \r\nbelieves that the collective efforts of the international \r\ncommunity can ensure that the Treaty will soon enter \r\ninto force, and we are prepared to do whatever is \r\nnecessary to promote that. With regard to eliminating \r\nnuclear threats and their secondary consequences for \r\nhealth and the environment, Slovakia actively supports \r\nthe entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty, which we consider to be an important pillar \r\nof nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.\r\nI wish to particularly stress — and I repeat this \r\nat every meeting here at the United Nations — that \r\nsecurity sector reform is a key component of post-\r\nconflict development and effective reinforcement \r\nof the rule of law. In the context of the consolidation \r\nprocess, we therefore consider it an inseparable part of \r\n13-48449 39/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nthe international community. Slovakia has experience \r\nin political and economic transition and integration \r\ninto European and trans-Atlantic structures. Slovakia \r\nnow primarily shares the lessons it has learned from \r\nbuilding civil society and public governance reforms \r\nwith the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the \r\nWestern Balkans, as well as others, including Kenya \r\nand Afghanistan. Slovakia concentrates on poverty \r\neradication by facilitating access to health care and \r\neducation and by enhancing the status of women and \r\nyoung people in those countries.\r\nWe are going through turbulent times. The United \r\nNations has the potential to be a global leader in ensuring \r\npeace and prosperity for all. But if its effectiveness is \r\nnot enhanced, the Organization’s relevance will be \r\nat risk. In order to perform all its tasks, the United \r\nNations must be strong, inclusive and open. Global \r\nlinks require strengthening existing partnerships with \r\nregional organizations, partners from the private sector \r\nand, last but not least, civil society. We understand \r\nthat the United Nations needs sufficient financial and \r\nhuman resources to effectively fulfil its mandates, but \r\nwe call for their more efficient use.\r\nThis year, Slovakia celebrates the twentieth \r\nanniversary of its sovereign existence. It was only \r\nnatural that the first steps of Slovakia as a sovereign \r\nState led to the United Nations. The principles and \r\nobjectives of the United Nations represent the firm \r\ncornerstone of Slovak foreign policy, based on the \r\nvalues of effective multilateralism. Over these 20 years, \r\nSlovakia’s cooperation with the United Nations has \r\nstrengthened and intensified as Slovakia has grown \r\nand as its position as a stable democratic country and a \r\nreliable, proactive partner at the international level has \r\nbeen strengthened. Thanks to that development, in June \r\nI was able to host a summit of 20 Eastern and Central \r\nEuropean presidents in Bratislava, where we discussed \r\nways to address the current financial and economic \r\ncrisis and on good regional cooperation.\r\nSlovakia has been contributing to a wide range \r\nof United Nations activities through its work in the \r\nOrganization’s main bodies and its direct involvement \r\nin more than 17 peacekeeping operations, as well as by \r\nimplementing over 400 humanitarian and development \r\nprojects in more than 20 countries worldwide. Having \r\nwon the trust of its partners, Slovakia has been elected \r\nto all relevant United Nations bodies, enabling it to \r\npromote and enforce even more effectively the values \r\nof the United Nations in all three main pillars of its \r\nin the development agenda beyond 2015. There are \r\nsome 1 billion people with disabilities worldwide, \r\nmany of them living in poverty, who are still excluded \r\nfrom equitable access to education, health care, jobs, \r\nand social and legal support systems. This dialogue \r\nis another step forward towards the empowerment \r\nof people with disabilities. We want to stress the \r\nimportance of including this issue in the development \r\nagenda beyond 2015. We are also paying increased \r\nattention to ensuring access to energy supply, water and \r\nsafe food for all.\r\nSlovakia wants to actively participate in the \r\npreparation of the development goals beyond 2015 \r\nand is getting ready for a new stage in development \r\ncooperation. We have only recently become a \r\nmember of the Development Assistance Council of \r\nthe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment, ref lecting our commitment to becoming \r\na full-f ledged member of the international community \r\nof donor countries. Slovakia has thoroughly studied \r\nthe report of the High-Level Panel on the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda, which sets out a global \r\nframework for development cooperation goals. The \r\ngoals and measures must be coherent with and integrate \r\ndevelopment, social and environmental aspects in line \r\nwith the outcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development in Rio. \r\nThe new goals must ensure effective and measurable \r\nresults. The crucial task will be identifying resources \r\nto meet the new sustainable development goals. Our \r\nefforts to meet the Millennium Development Goals \r\nhave been hindered by the ongoing lack of public funds \r\nand resources. The economic and financial crisis has \r\nhelped to reveal a number of systemic deficiencies in \r\nthe distribution and control of resources, in particular \r\npublic ones, as well as the need to draw on innovative \r\nresources, including private ones, in the process. \r\nSlovakia wants to contribute to the discussion through \r\nits work in the Committee of Experts on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Financing.\r\nUntil recently, Slovakia was a recipient of \r\ndevelopment assistance. Naturally, it now wants to give \r\nback by supporting countries dependent on assistance \r\nfrom the international community. This year, we \r\ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of \r\na national system for official development assistance. \r\nThe focus of the development assistance provided by \r\nSlovakia reflects the needs of countries that rely on such \r\nassistance and responds to the global challenges within \r\n40/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nentire world. And to that, we would have to add the \r\ninjured, the people mutilated by anti-personnel mines, \r\nthose who have suffered the infamy of kidnapping and \r\nthose uprooted from their own land, who could amount \r\nto almost 5 million people.\r\nThat is the harsh and ugly reality of a conflict that \r\nunfortunately persists to this day. It is the oldest and \r\nthe last conflict in the western hemisphere. In spite \r\nof the conflict, Colombia has achieved unprecedented \r\nprogress in recent years on matters of security, in \r\nthe fight against poverty and inequality, and in its \r\neconomic performance. We have achieved much — a \r\ngreat deal — in the midst of a confrontation. Imagine \r\nhow much more we could have done without the \r\nconfrontation. And I must confess to the Assembly that \r\nfor me, as the head of the Government, it would have \r\nbeen easy to continue to move forward on the path that \r\nwe were on and to leave the conflict unresolved, because \r\nwaging war — and I know how to wage war — is easier \r\nthan seeking peace.\r\nIt would have been easier, but not responsible, \r\nbecause continuing to coexist with the conflict would be \r\nlike sentencing millions of people to many more years \r\nof violence, fear, poverty and victimization. It would \r\nnot be responsible towards Latin America or towards \r\nthe world, as they also suffer, in different ways, from \r\nthe effects of the Colombian conflict. And it would not \r\nbe responsible towards my own conscience, because we \r\nhave the best possible opportunity before us today — a \r\nreal opportunity, and maybe the last — to put an end \r\nto the conflict. I could not die in peace if I failed to do \r\neverything within my power to seize the opportunity \r\npresented. \r\nMy generation has not seen a single day of peace, \r\nand my dream is for my children and the children of all \r\nColombians to have the opportunity to know peace. I \r\nhope that the guerrilla forces understand that the time \r\nhas come to leave this 50-year confrontation behind; \r\nthat the time has come to move from bullets to votes, \r\nfrom weapons to discussion; that the time has come for \r\nthem to continue their struggle, but within democracy.\r\nToday, before the General Assembly, we Colombians \r\nwant to thank the international community for the \r\nsupport we have received in the endeavour to bring an \r\nend to our conflict through dialogue. With the world \r\nas our witness, we wish to assert our right to achieve \r\nthe peace. We are tired of being afraid, we are tired of \r\nviolence, we are tired of a conflict that pits the children \r\nwork. I can assure the General Assembly that Slovakia \r\nwill continue its tireless efforts to serve and assist in \r\nmeeting the United Nations goals as a reliable partner.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ivan Gašparovič, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nColombia.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nshould like to depart slightly from protocol and start \r\nmy statement by speaking about a humble woman, a \r\nColombian named María Zabala, who has to bear the \r\nburden of immense pain in her heart day in and day \r\nout. Two decades ago, armed members of illegal groups \r\narrived outside her house located on the Colombian \r\nCaribbean coast, determined to impose their rule \r\nof terror. In front of her and her small children, they \r\nmurdered her husband and two other relatives. They \r\nforced her to leave her house and then they burned \r\neverything down. She barely managed to remove the \r\ncorpses from the ashes. She buried them right there \r\nand f led from her parcel of land with her children \r\nand without any belongings. All she carried was the \r\nimmense weight of her tragedy.\r\nToday, María Zabala is a courageous and inspiring \r\nleader, a leader of victims, who is working for peace \r\nin my country. In Colombia, sadly, there are many \r\nthousands of cases like María Zabala’s. It is estimated \r\nthat over the past 50 years, over 220,000 people died \r\nbecause of the conflict. That is more than twice the \r\ndeath toll of the Bosnian war in the former Yugoslavia, \r\nwhich was an open and ruthless conflict that moved the \r\n13-48449 41/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nhonesty and seriousness, and that is what we are doing \r\nin Colombia.\r\nWe have adopted an integrated strategy for \r\ntransitional justice that addresses the issues of truth, \r\njustice and reparations, which we hope will enable \r\nus to make the transition towards peace. We can say \r\nthat we have been pioneers in the implementation of \r\ntransitional justice measures in the midst of conflict, \r\ngiving priority to satisfying the rights of victims. No \r\none in my country wants the perpetuation of violence.\r\nWhat we are asking from the United Nations and \r\nthe international community is that both Colombia’s and \r\nevery nation’s right to seek peace be respected We ask \r\nfor continued support in that effort, along with respect \r\nfor our decisions and our approach, with confidence in \r\nthe fact that our actions have never deviated from the \r\nvalues of the international community.\r\nWe cannot investigate every action committed over \r\nhalf a century of violence, prosecute each and every one \r\nof those responsible and then find ourselves unable to \r\nfollow through. But what we can do is to build a realistic \r\nand transparent strategy that may satisfy the rights of \r\nall the victims in the best possible way. If we understand \r\njustice and the fight against impunity in a transition as \r\na set of measures aimed at satisfying the victims and \r\nnot just as the administration of criminal processes, \r\nit will be possible to find a comprehensive solution \r\nfor everyone. I refer to measures such as genuinely \r\nestablishing the facts of events, the acknowledgment \r\nof responsibility, the recovery of trust, access to \r\nreparations, and measures aimed at ensuring that there \r\nwill be no recurrence. In that way justice becomes — as \r\nit should be — a support for, rather than an obstacle to, \r\npeace.\r\nI want to be clear: there will be no impunity for \r\ncrimes against humanity or war crimes committed \r\nin a systematic fashion. On the contrary, this is the \r\nfirst time that Colombia is seriously assuming the \r\nobligation of fighting impunity for crimes committed \r\nin our armed conflict. The purpose is not to sacrifice \r\njustice to achieve peace, but rather to achieve peace \r\nwith maximum justice. I am saying that out of deep \r\nconviction. There is much at stake, that is, no less than \r\nan end to the half-century long conflict, as well as the \r\nfate of 47 million Colombians.\r\nWe have been involved in talks for one year \r\nnow, but we have reached agreements on just one of \r\nthe six items on the agenda. I am still optimistic, but \r\nof the same nation against each other and delays our \r\ndevelopment. María Zabala is one victim among many, \r\nall of whom are entitled to justice, truth and reparations \r\nand to not seeing history repeat itself. That is what we \r\nare working on in our country.\r\nMy Government has promoted our most ambitious \r\nbill yet, recognizing and compensating victims in the \r\nmidst of a conflict. I had the honour of ratifying that bill \r\nin the presence of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. But \r\nour commitment goes beyond serving the victims of the \r\npast; our most urgent obligation today is to eliminate \r\nthe possibility of new victims being claimed by the \r\nconflict. Our obligation is to end the conflict now and \r\nto ensure that the spiral of violence and pain will not \r\ncontinue to recur. We are doing that in accordance with \r\nour democratic tradition — of course respecting, as we \r\nalways have, the rule of law — and in compliance with \r\nour international obligations. We wish to achieve an \r\nend to our conflict without relinquishing justice, much \r\nless the truth and due care of the victims. \r\nI take this opportunity to offer my thoughts to the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the role of the United Nations and \r\nthe multilateral organizations in our peace process and \r\nits future implementation. The subject is relevant and \r\ncurrent, since Colombia is possibly the first country in \r\nthe world to engage in a process of that nature since \r\nthe entry into force of the Rome Statute, which will \r\nmake us a model for other cases where dialogue is given \r\npriority over armed solutions, as should be the case. \r\nFormer United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights Louise Arbour of Canada recently stated \r\nthat international doctrine had not been successful \r\nin finding practical answers as to how to resolve the \r\nreal tension that exists between peace and justice in \r\na negotiation process. Ms. Arbour recalled examples, \r\nsuch as International Criminal Tribunals for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which had been given \r\nimmense resources but had yielded very poor results.\r\nThe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, \r\nestablished in 1994, has managed to dispose of only \r\n40 cases out of the nearly 800,000 murders committed \r\nin a single year. In 20 years, the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has resolved barely \r\n100 cases.\r\nTherefore, how can we simultaneously achieve \r\nthe end of armed conflict, fulfil our obligation to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute and realize the rights of \r\nvictims? That dilemma must be confronted with \r\n42/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nall universities and think tanks, and in the context of \r\ndifferent forums, not just from Latin America but from \r\nthe whole world, because it is a global problem that \r\nrequires a global solution. Because of that — because \r\nit is a global problem — we expect their conclusions \r\nto also be discussed in this body, the United Nations, \r\nwhich has already called for a special session on the \r\ndrug problem to be convened in 2016. \r\nIf we act together on the drug problem and adopt a \r\nnew, modern and comprehensive vision that is free of \r\nideological or political bias, imagine how much harm \r\nand violence we will be able to prevent. I am not just \r\nspeaking about harm to people, but also harm to nature, \r\nbecause drug trafficking has become a major destroyer \r\nof our tropical forests and forests in general, in what \r\ncan be termed a veritable ecocide.\r\nColombia is deeply committed to environmental \r\nprotection. At the Rio de Janeiro Conference on \r\nSustainable Development, we put forward the proposal \r\nto establish sustainable development goals as a \r\nmandatory benchmark in the development agenda for \r\nthe coming decades. We are taking an active part in \r\nthe design of those goals, and they can and should \r\nbe incorporated into a visionary and ambitious \r\ndevelopment agenda for all countries as of 2015. In fact, \r\nwe were a member of the High-level Panel on the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda, convened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and co-chaired by the Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, David Cameron, which has already \r\npresented its report. \r\nColombia, for its part, is continuing to do a great \r\ndeal. For example, a few weeks ago, we doubled the \r\narea of the largest national park in Colombia, the \r\nChiribiquete National Natural Park, located in the very \r\nheart of our Amazon region. We designated that area a \r\nnatural reserve and prohibited mining and deforestation \r\nactivities in an area roughly the size of Belgium, and \r\nnot just in any place, but in the area where the Amazon \r\nregion has the greatest biological and cultural diversity. \r\nThis very morning we are launching, with the \r\nPrime Minister of Norway and five other countries, \r\nthe New Climate Economy initiative. With the support \r\nof the most respected research institutes, we will seek \r\nthe best way of making economic efficiencies and the \r\nfight against poverty compatible with the preservation \r\nof the environment. In that way we are shouldering our \r\nresponsibilities with respect to climate change, which \r\nhas already had an impact on Colombians. We will \r\nthe patience of the Colombian people is not infinite. \r\nThe guerrillas will have to decide whether they opt \r\nfor an honourable and lasting peace, or whether they \r\nwill continue to wage war. From this rostrum, I call \r\nupon them to understand that history has led us to this \r\ndecisive moment. The time for decisions has come. If \r\nwe leave empty-handed, we will doom our nation to \r\nmany more years of bloodshed and pain. We cannot \r\nmiss this opportunity.Future generations and history \r\nwill not forgive us.\r\nMoreover, our conflict, with all its violence and \r\ncruelty, has been affected by a poisonous scourge that \r\nfuels it and is fuelled by it: drug trafficking. That illicit \r\nactivity has been the main funding source for violence \r\nand terrorism in my country — and I would say in the \r\nwhole world as well in recent times. Without the grim \r\ninfluence of drug trafficking, which fuels the fires of \r\nour war, I am certain that the war would already have \r\nended. That is why we have included the topic of illicit \r\ndrugs as a specific item in the agenda of the discussions \r\nwith the guerrillas.\r\nIf we manage to have the guerrillas change sides, \r\nonce they have demobilized, and become an ally of \r\nthe State in order to definitively curb drug trafficking \r\nand eliminate illegal crops, just imagine what could \r\nbe accomplished. A Colombia without coca crops and \r\nwithout a conflict was once a utopia and an impossible \r\ndream, but it is one that we can now realize for the \r\nbenefit not only of Colombians but of the whole world.\r\nAlmost a half century ago, in this very place, the \r\nConvention that gave birth to the war on drugs was \r\nadopted. Today we must recognize that that war has not \r\nbeen won. I say that as the President of the country that \r\nhas suffered the most deaths, the most bloodshed, the \r\nmost sacrifices in that war, and also the country that \r\nhas achieved the most results in the fight against this \r\nscourge and the mafias that underpin it. \r\nLast year, when chairing the Summit of the \r\nAmericas, fully aware of that dilemma, I led a proposal \r\nto debate and explore different scenarios in the fight \r\nagainst the global drug problem, aimed at evaluating \r\nwhat we are doing and at seeking ways to be more \r\neffective. We commissioned the Organization of \r\nAmerican States to conduct studies with experts, \r\nacademics and people with different approaches on \r\nhow to face the problem. Those studies were delivered \r\nto us in May. Different Governments are evaluating \r\nthem and they should serve as inputs for discussions at \r\n13-48449 43/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nto dedicate their efforts to finding solutions to the issues \r\nof poverty, hunger and sustainable development in a way \r\nthat goes beyond simply convening conferences and \r\nadopting resolutions, and even beyond the necessary \r\ncollective attention and campaigns that are called for \r\nfrom time to time, important as they might be.\r\nRecently, the Arab region has experienced many \r\nhistoric events and accelerating change. It has witnessed \r\nturbulent events arising from popular movements and \r\ntheir forceful entry into the public and political arenas.\r\nStalemate continues to characterize the Arab-\r\nIsraeli conflict. That conflict is at the forefront of the \r\nissues threatening international peace and security, \r\nowing to the continued Israeli occupation and the \r\ninjustices inflicted upon the Palestinian people, as \r\nwell as the failure to reach a just and lasting peace in \r\naccordance with resolutions of international legality. \r\nThe continued Israeli occupation of Palestinian and \r\nArab territories cannot be accepted as normal. Its \r\npractices include the changing of the demographic \r\nconditions in those territories, particularly through the \r\nexpansion of settlement activity, the Judaization of the \r\ncity of Jerusalem, the unjust embargo against the Gaza \r\nStrip, and intensification of settlement activities in the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan and changing its status quo and \r\ndemographics. This is not simply because such actions \r\nrepresent f lagrant violations of international laws and \r\ncovenants, but also because the Palestinian cause is a \r\njust cause and the historical injustice inflicted upon the \r\nPalestinian people must end.\r\nThe major international bodies were established \r\non the basis of the right to self-determination in the \r\naftermath of two world wars. It is unreasonable that \r\nthey cannot do anything about the last remaining \r\ncolonial issue in the world. \r\nIsrael should realize that coercion and de facto \r\npolicies do not bring security. It is wrong for it to \r\nestablish a State that believes that the prospect for \r\npeace lies in subjugating other peoples, denying their \r\nrights and making that a priority over peace. \r\nThere can be no security without peace. True \r\npeace can come about only through coexistence among \r\npeoples on the basis of good-neighbourliness, mutual \r\nrespect and respect for the interests of all. The peace we \r\ndesire is built upon dignity, justice and the principles \r\nof international legality, as well as United Nations \r\nresolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative, the principle \r\nof a two-State solution and the withdrawal of Israel \r\nprotect the sources of oxygen and water necessary not \r\njust for Colombia’s survival but that of the entire planet.\r\nI will conclude by stating that in my country we are \r\nworking and will continue to work to prevent the plight \r\nof María Zabala and millions of other victims from ever \r\nrecurring. Never again! I hope that the President of \r\nColombia will come to the Assembly next year bearing \r\nthe good news that the conflict has come to an end.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Amir of the State of Qatar.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): I would like \r\nfirst to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-eighth session, and I wish him every success in his \r\nmission. I would like also to express our appreciation \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, President of the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-seventh session, for his efforts \r\nfor the success of that session. I would like also to \r\ncommend the efforts of His Excellency the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, to strengthen the role of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe international community faces many different \r\nproblems related to peace and security, in addition to \r\nchallenges facing the efforts made to solve disputes \r\npeacefully. This calls for strengthening the United \r\nNations capacity to tackle these challenges and \r\nproblems.\r\nPeoples from different regions of the world are \r\nexpecting the institutions of the international community \r\n44/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nsupervision. They did so in order to get rid of despotism \r\nand corruption and to put an end to the injustice they \r\nhave been facing.\r\nWe all know that the responsibility for the failure \r\nto impose the political settlement we would all prefer \r\nfor Syria is due basically to the Security Council’s \r\ninability to take the decisions required to put an end \r\nto the bloodshed and to the continued intransigence of \r\nthe Syrian regime and its rejection of all regional and \r\ninternational initiatives.\r\nFrom that perspective, the decision-making process \r\nin the Security Council must change, since it lacks \r\nfairness and objectivity. It has also become a major \r\nobstacle to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity and to the punishment of war criminals and \r\nperpetrators of crimes against humanity. We therefore \r\nreiterate the importance of accelerating comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council in order to make it more \r\ncapable of dealing objectively with global challenges \r\nand responding to the aspirations of peoples. That can \r\nbe achieved only through equitable representation of \r\nthe international community in the Council, so that it \r\ncan become expressive of democracy in international \r\nmultilateral efforts. \r\nWhile it is obviously impossible for any decision \r\nto be taken in the Council without the support \r\nof the majority of the permanent member States, \r\ndecision-making should not be monopolized in the long \r\nterm by one or two States.\r\nI take this opportunity to call upon our Syrian \r\nbrothers to unify their ranks in order to initiate a \r\ntransitional period leading to the establishment of \r\na governing system that guarantees freedom and \r\ndignity for all Syrians, without discrimination on the \r\ngrounds of gender, nationality, sect or creed. These \r\nlarge numbers of martyrs have not fallen and all these \r\nsacrifices have not been made by this great people so \r\nthat despotism could be exchanged for chaos or another \r\nkind of despotism. \r\nThe Arab Spring revolutions, during which the \r\nArab people have risen up, calling for freedom, dignity \r\nand social justice, are now facing difficulties that seem \r\nto be aimed at reversing the march of time. As such \r\ndifficulties had been anticipated, it is strange that \r\ncertain politicians have not been able to avoid even \r\nexpected problems.\r\nAnyone who knows the reality of the issues in the \r\nArab region and their historical context knows that these \r\nfrom all occupied Arab territories. The experiences \r\nof different nations and peoples confirm that unjust \r\nsettlements do not endure but only lead to new conflicts.\r\nThe continued de facto policy in Palestine will not \r\nmake the issue disappear. It is actually becoming more \r\ncomplicated, because continuing settlement activities \r\nare leading to the destruction of the foundation for \r\nthe establishment of a Palestinian State. The current \r\nstatus quo resembles a situation of apartheid under the \r\ndomination of one State or even within a single State. \r\nThat cannot but be grounds for fresh conflict, as no \r\npeople could accept continued injustice and remain \r\nsilent.\r\nThe inalienable national rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople to establish their independent State, with \r\nJerusalem as its capital and within the limits of 1967 \r\nborders, as well as the right of return for Palestinian \r\nrefugees, are not only an Arab demand; they also \r\nrepresent an international standard for testing the \r\ncredibility of international legality, which should not \r\nbe divisible. Just as the international community has in \r\nthe past applied the principles of international legality \r\nto other crises in the world, we should apply the same \r\nlegal principles to all issues. We therefore call upon \r\nthe Security Council to uphold its responsibility to \r\nmaintain international peace and security and to take \r\nthe decisions necessary to stop all illegitimate Israeli \r\npractices.\r\nDestructive actions and appalling massacres, \r\nincluding the policy of scorched earth and the \r\ndestruction of cities, continue to be carried out by the \r\nSyrian regime against its peoples, crossing all red lines \r\ndictated by ethics and mandated by law, particularly in \r\nview of the regime’s use of chemical weapons against \r\nthe Syrian people.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the perpetrators of those \r\nbrutal crimes and massacres, which have shocked every \r\nhuman conscience, are, undeterred, enjoying impunity \r\nfrom accountability. That raises questions about the \r\ncredibility of the human rights and international legality \r\nmechanisms of the international community.\r\nThe issue is not whether or not Syria possesses \r\nchemical weapons, because Syria is a State that is in \r\nconflict with another State that possesses chemical, \r\nbiological and even nuclear weapons. The issue is the \r\nuse of such weapons by the regime against its own \r\npeople. The Syrian people did not rise up in order to \r\nplace Syrian chemical weapons under international \r\n13-48449 45/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\na very alarming issue. In that context, I affirm the \r\nposition of the State of Qatar that every State in the \r\nregion has an absolute right to use nuclear power for \r\npeaceful purposes in accordance with the standards \r\nand procedures of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. We also look forward to convening the Helsinki \r\nconference as a step that contributes to the efforts \r\naimed at making the Middle East a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\r\nThe issue of climate change remains at the top of \r\nour concerns, with all its ramifications for the global \r\nsystem as a whole. In that regard, I would like to \r\nconfirm and reiterate the commitment of the State of \r\nQatar to continued cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity in facing that challenge and implementing \r\nthe measures agreed upon during the eighteenth \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nwhich was hosted by Qatar at the end of last year, in \r\norder to develop a road map for tackling the negative \r\nenvironmental and economic consequences of that \r\ndangerous phenomenon.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the State of Qatar has \r\ngone a long way towards implementing the initiative \r\nof the Global Dry Land Alliance, which it launched \r\nin order to establish an international organization that \r\nwould tackle the implications of that phenomenon. \r\nThat proposed organization will complement the work \r\nof the other relevant international organizations in \r\ncombatting desertification and drought and preserving \r\nthe environment without duplicating their work. I call \r\nupon all Member States to support that initiative.\r\nThe State of Qatar participates as an active and \r\neffective partner in efforts to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment at the international level. We have pledged \r\nto allocate the required percentage of our gross national \r\nproduct for the least developed countries, in addition \r\nto the humanitarian and relief assistance that our State \r\nprovides in cases of emergency and disaster.\r\nIn that context, the State of Qatar has achieved the \r\nmajority of the Millennium Development Goals and is \r\nworking towards achieving all the Goals before 2015, as \r\ndemonstrated by United Nations and regional reports in \r\nthat field.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Amir of the State of \r\nQatar for the statement he has just made.\r\nrevolutions have taken place in the context of a long-\r\nterm historical process similar to those experienced \r\npreviously by various peoples in Europe, America, Asia \r\nand Africa. The path to a just rule and to meeting the \r\ndemands of peoples in all States of the world has never \r\nbeen easy; it has always been replete with sacrifices. \r\nIt is not easy to follow such a path with patience and \r\ndetermination. Rarely have there been revolutions that \r\nhave not been followed by desperate attempts by former \r\nregimes to abort them. That is why wise people always \r\nprefer that regime change should take place through a \r\nprocess of gradual reform. \r\nBut we also know very well that in some cases, in \r\nour region and in other regions of the world, change \r\ncould not have taken place through reform. We should \r\nnot jump to hasty conclusions about the future of the \r\nArab revolutions. This is a historical necessity and a \r\nlong-term one. It is clear that things in the Arab world \r\nwill not revert to the way they were and that the Arab \r\npeoples have become more aware of their rights and \r\nmore involved in the public domain.\r\nThe State of Qatar has always opted to be an active \r\nand effective party playing a constructive role at the \r\ninternational level through its balanced economic \r\nand political relations at the bilateral and multilateral \r\nlevels. We will continue to take that approach, so that \r\nthe State of Qatar can uphold its responsibilities and \r\ncommitments at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels. The State of Qatar aims to be a hub for dialogue \r\nand discussion among various parties to conflicts and \r\nnot to be a party to such conflicts. We aim also to create \r\nopportunities for cultural and informational dialogue \r\nbetween peoples.\r\nIn that context, the process of reform and \r\nmodernity initiated by Qatar, which has made it a State \r\nof institutions and one that is interacting positively \r\nwith the international community, was achieved \r\nonly through a genuine commitment to applying \r\nthe rule of law and principles of good governance, \r\ncombating corruption, protecting human rights and \r\nbasic freedoms, empowering women to participate in \r\npublic life on an equal footing with men, and creating \r\na healthy environment for children. In addition, our \r\nnational policies have always focused, as a priority, on \r\nthe concerns of young people and on creating a suitable \r\neducational environment for them aimed at ensuring \r\nthe maximum use of their capacities. \r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nin particular nuclear weapons, in the Middle East is \r\n46/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nIt is in a sombre international context that we are \r\ngoing to define the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nan agenda that will be the cornerstone of the work of \r\nthe Organization and will be crucial to establishing \r\nits political legitimacy for decades to come. The \r\ngrowing insecurity in the world, characterized by the \r\nfragmentation of societies, threatens the progress made \r\nin many fields and causes multidimensional regional \r\ninstability that is likely to further deepen existing \r\ndifferences. \r\nThe recent attacks perpetrated in Kenya, Pakistan \r\nand Iraq are another shocking illustration of that \r\nproblem. They remind us that many parts of the world \r\nare still subject to deadly terrorist attacks. Allow me \r\nto extend to the families of the victims and to their \r\nGovernment my deepest condolences. \r\nI must also speak out against persisting conflicts, \r\nwhich hamper development and cause an unacceptable \r\nhumanitarian situation. With regard to Syria in \r\nparticular, the number of displaced civilians and \r\nrefugees in bordering countries is of great concern. A \r\nnew threshold was crossed with the use of chemical \r\nweapons, an extremely serious violation of international \r\nlaw that cannot be tolerated. Monaco associates itself \r\nwith those who continue to advocate for a political \r\nsettlement of the conflict, especially in the light of \r\nthe recent agreement on the control and destruction \r\nof chemical weapons stockpiles in Syria. Those \r\nresponsible for the use of chemical weapons cannot go \r\nunpunished. \r\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross, \r\nwhich I wish to pay tribute to for its determination to \r\nfulfil its mandate in spite of difficult circumstances, \r\nmust be given access to populations in need and must \r\nbe assured that it is able to conduct its activities in full \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe tenth anniversary of the attack on United \r\nNations staff in Baghdad is a sad reminder that we \r\nneed to relentlessly continue with our efforts on \r\nbehalf of United Nations staff, who too often have \r\nbecome deliberate targets. That deplorable situation \r\nwill be given attention in the coming world summit \r\non humanitarian aid to be held on the initiative of the \r\nSecretary-General, which we fully support.\r\nThe evolution of factors that lead to humanitarian \r\nemergencies forces us to examine the ways in which \r\nthe Organization can act in such circumstances, which \r\ninclude conflicts, natural disasters, climate change and \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Serene Highness Prince Albert II  \r\nof Monaco\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Alberto II of Monaco.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II of Monaco \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II of Monaco and to invite him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nPrince Albert (spoke in French): Twenty years ago \r\nI took the f loor for the first time before the General \r\nAssembly. A few months before that, on 28 May 1993, \r\nMonaco had become the one hundred and eighty-third \r\nState Member of the United Nations, the smallest \r\nMember State of the only universal Organization. The \r\ndecision of Prince Rainier III, my father, ref lected \r\nthe will to fully assume our role as a responsible and \r\ncommitted State within a changing world, where new \r\nopportunities and new challenges were becoming \r\ninterdependent and transcending borders. \r\nThat vision remains unchanged over the passage \r\nof time. My country continues to shoulder all its \r\nresponsibilities on the major issues that bring us \r\ntogether here today. Faithful to its principles and to \r\nits past, the Principality of Monaco wishes to make \r\nits contribution in the most effective way possible to \r\nthe task of building peace, to which we have been so \r\nattached over the centuries. \r\nTherefore, inspired by a conviction that our shared \r\nhumanity requires that each of us treat our fellow \r\nhuman beings with respect and dignity, tolerance \r\nand comprehension, we have endorsed the values and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nwe aspire together to defend and to promote. That \r\nimportant decision to fulfil the responsibility that each \r\nMember State has is strengthened by the conviction, \r\noriginating from the holding of the first Earth Summit, \r\nin 1992, that sustainable development, without which \r\nwe cannot aspire to our ideal of peace, must be planned \r\nwith respect for the environment of our planet. \r\n13-48449 47/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nof development can be launched and help build a more \r\njust, stable and less unequal world.\r\nImportant advances have often been accompanied \r\nor completed by the adoption of measures emerging \r\nfrom the Organization’s major conferences and \r\nsummits. By strengthening the treaty regime on human \r\nrights, disarmament and the fight against terrorism, and \r\nthrough the regimes established by the Security Council, \r\nMember States have endowed themselves with the \r\nmeans to reaffirm their faith in multilateralism, which \r\nis the reason for the Organization’s existence, and in \r\nthe rule of law, which is the foundation of our collective \r\naction. It is vital that we speed up the implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action adopted in Istanbul in 2011 \r\nat the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least \r\nDeveloped Countries.\r\nThe work that lies ahead for the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly comes at a turning point in our \r\nhistory. Under his leadership, the General Assembly \r\nmust not only speed up the implementation of the MDGs \r\nbut also prepare the post-2015 development agenda and \r\ndefine the sustainable development goals in accordance \r\nwith this session’s theme “The post-2015 development \r\nagenda: setting the stage”.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nHis valuable experience and unreserved dedication \r\nto the Organization, and to sustainable development in \r\nparticular, will guide our deliberations. We are grateful \r\nto have him, a son of Antigua and Barbuda, a small \r\nisland developing State, presiding over the upcoming \r\ndiscussions, since we are confident that he is all too \r\nfamiliar with the issues at stake.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nHe should also rest assured that Monaco’s \r\nrepresentative, in its capacity as Vice-President, is \r\nready to support him in his noble task.\r\nBased on lessons learned from the MDGs, together \r\nwe will build an ambitious new development programme \r\ncapable of responding effectively to the demands of our \r\nnew reality. I have climate change in mind in particular. \r\nGreenhouse-gas emissions continue to increase at the \r\nglobal level, despite the fact that we have identified \r\nclimate change as one of the greatest dangers of our \r\nera. The Secretary-General can count on my country’s \r\ncontribution to the upcoming summit on climate \r\nchange, which he intends to hold next September. His \r\nwillingness to bring together leaders from every sector \r\nenvironmental degradation. We must recognize that the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, to \r\nwhich I express my deepest gratitude, needs to be given \r\nthe means and the resources required for it to carry out \r\nthe mandate we have given it.\r\nTo those who criticize or threaten the progress of \r\nthe United Nations, the results accomplished show that \r\nour courageous political decisions, in the fields of both \r\nsecurity and development, are timely and positive. \r\nTogether, in the year 2000, we defined the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), which today \r\nhave made it possible for billions of people to live \r\nbetter. Those successes are all the more remarkable \r\ngiven that progress has been achieved in spite of the \r\neffects of many crises of a financial, economic, food \r\nand energy nature, some of whose consequences linger \r\nand are even worsening. \r\nTomorrow, the special event devoted to the \r\nMDGs will be an opportunity to reiterate our priority \r\ncommitment to eliminating poverty and an opportunity \r\nfor us to redouble efforts to hasten the achievement of \r\nthe Goals. \r\nThe Millennium Development Goals Report 2013 \r\nindicates the areas that require urgent action and the \r\nsignificant gaps that exist, not only among countries \r\nbut within their borders. We cannot tolerate the fact that \r\nthere are still people who have been rejected by society, \r\npeople for whom the hope born of a new millennium \r\nremains a broken promise. It is not acceptable that in \r\ntoday’s world human beings still live close to complete \r\ndestitution, where even their basic needs go unmet. \r\nThat is why we applaud the Secretary-General’s efforts \r\non behalf of his mobilization campaigns — Education \r\nFirst, “Every woman, every child” and Scaling \r\nUp Nutrition — which push us to shoulder our \r\nresponsibilities towards the world’s most vulnerable.\r\nEducation, the promotion of women, the protection \r\nof children, public health and the conservation \r\nof natural resources are priority elements in the \r\ninternational cooperation policies that I have outlined. \r\nThey are structured around the eight MDGs, especially \r\nmaternal and child health, the fight against pandemics \r\nand neglected diseases and the promotion of food \r\nsecurity, and in particular they are geared towards the \r\nleast developed countries. It seems to me that a policy \r\nof international cooperation should respond as much \r\nas possible to their interests, so that a virtuous circle \r\n48/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nin the polar regions. If the viability and sustainable \r\nmanagement of the oceans are to be achieved, only \r\nan unswerving political willingness to form strong \r\npartnerships that unite all the parties concerned will be \r\nable to combat the effects of the overfishing, pollution \r\nand acidification of the oceans and restore them to \r\nhealth and productivity.\r\nStrengthening cooperation and partnerships, as well \r\nas deciding on concrete action, are also at the heart of \r\nthe preparations for the third International Conference \r\non Small Island Developing States, to which I want to \r\ngive my full support, along with a needed boost in the \r\nsolidarity that is essential to promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe stakes are clear. Let us, who wish to reaffirm \r\nthe central place that the Organization occupies in \r\ninternational governance, give it the means to assure \r\nthat leadership role by being ambitious and resolute \r\nin our task. Let us remember the words of the novelist \r\nAntoine de Saint-Exupéry: “Being a human being \r\nmeans being responsible”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank His Serene \r\nHighness Prince Albert II of Monaco for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nPrince Albert II of Monaco was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jacob Zuma, President \r\nof the Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Zuma: It is an honour and a privilege \r\nfor me to once again address this body. South Africa \r\nattaches the utmost importance to the General Assembly \r\nas the most representative and democratic organ of the \r\nUnited Nations serving the international community.\r\nof society — civil society, the private sector, the world \r\nof business and finance and, above all, young people, \r\nall of them agents of change — is the only path of hope \r\nfor the radical transformation that is needed. There is \r\nno alternative to defining a new programme and a new \r\nparadigm.\r\nAt the current rate, if we do not change our \r\nbehaviour, we will need the equivalent of two planet \r\nEarths to meet the needs of the world’s population, \r\nwhich, as we know, will reach 9 billion in 2050 and \r\nhas always been concentrated in urban and coastal \r\nzones, whose natural resources are particularly \r\nvulnerable. That simple fact should prompt us to adopt \r\nsustainable modes of production and consumption, \r\nin accordance with the decisions taken at the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development. That \r\nessential change of mindset presupposes that we place \r\nhuman beings at the heart of the development issue. It is \r\nno longer a question of agreeing on development plans \r\nfor agricultural, artisanal and industrial capacities. We \r\nmust consider that it is human societies and individuals \r\nwho deserve all of our attention. We must study \r\neconomic and environmental issues in the light of their \r\nimpact on the lives of people and communities. Taking \r\nthose needs into account means that we must reflect \r\nfurther on how to ensure responsible development that \r\nrespects the environment and is truly sustainable.\r\nThe Assembly is aware of my personal commitment \r\nto issues involving the oceans and seas. In accordance \r\nwith the Monaco Message on the acknowledged \r\nimportance of the oceans in “The future we want” \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex), which was adopted in \r\nNovember 2011, I am once again committing to \r\npromoting the role of the oceans in the definition of \r\nthe post-2015 agenda and to reiterating my support for \r\na sustainable development goal focusing on the oceans. \r\nClimate regulation, food and nutrition security, energy, \r\ntourism, transport and international trade — all areas \r\nthat directly or indirectly affect the oceans — are \r\nlinked to the three pillars of sustainable development. \r\nI think it is also essential to reaffirm how fundamental \r\nthe oceans are to the world and how serious are the \r\nrisks presented to them through the excessive human \r\nactivity that contributes to their acidification and the \r\nacceleration of the drop in the resources they contain.\r\nIn that context, I would like to say how crucial I \r\nbelieve it is that the international community address the \r\nstatus of the high seas without delay, and how urgent it \r\nis that protected marine areas be established, especially \r\n13-48449 49/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nbecome huge non-tariff barriers. They include the green \r\neconomy and clean technology. While those issues are \r\nimportant for Africa and developing countries and need \r\nto be attended to, the manner in which they have been \r\ncrafted restrains economic development, as they are \r\nused as obstacles.\r\nWe also wish to emphasize our expectations that the \r\ndeveloped North and developing South will continue \r\nto engage in a genuine partnership. In that regard, \r\nthe developed North countries should stand ready to \r\nmeet their commitment to contribute 0.7 per cent of \r\ntheir gross national income to official development \r\nassistance.\r\nWe are aware of the challenges in the North caused \r\nby the economic meltdown, but we are of the view that \r\ninvesting in development in the South, especially in \r\nAfrica, is of primary importance as a source of much-\r\nneeded sustainable development and stability in the \r\nworld. Attempts to delegate some of those historical \r\nresponsibilities to new emerging economies in the South \r\nare unacceptable and unworkable, as such emerging \r\nnations have their own historical challenges and \r\nbacklogs to deal with. Furthermore, any commitment \r\nwe make to the future beyond 2015 must build on \r\nexisting agreements, which include Agenda 21, the \r\nMDGs, the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and \r\nthe outcome document of the Rio de Janeiro Conference \r\non Sustainable Development. In the case of Africa, \r\nthey must build on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment.\r\nDevelopment and security are two sides of the \r\nsame coin. The best way to ensure both is through good \r\ngovernance and the promotion of democratic values in \r\nall societies. Allow me, therefore, to register once again \r\nour serious concern that the Security Council, almost \r\n70 years since its establishment, remains undemocratic, \r\nunrepresentative and unfair to developing nations and \r\nsmall States, and disenfranchises the majority of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, which form the \r\nmajority in the General Assembly. We cannot remain \r\nbeholden indefinitely to the will of an unrepresentative \r\nminority on the most important issues of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nThere has been too much talk about the need for \r\nreform, with too little action. We would like to challenge \r\nthe Assembly today by saying “Let us set ourselves the \r\ntarget to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations in 2015 with a reformed, more inclusive, \r\ndemocratic and representative Security Council!”.\r\nWe congratulate President Ashe and the Republic of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We also \r\nthank Mr. Vuk Jeremić for the splendid way in which he \r\npresided over the Assembly at its sixty-seventh session.\r\nLet me begin by reiterating our condemnation of \r\nthe horrific terrorist attack over the weekend in Kenya, \r\nin which a number of civilians, including a South \r\nAfrican national, were killed. We express our deepest \r\ncondolences to the Government and people of Kenya \r\nand to all those families who lost loved ones, and wish \r\nthe wounded survivors a speedy recovery. We continue \r\nto support the efforts of Kenya and the international \r\ncommunity aimed at peacekeeping, stability, democracy \r\nand nation-building in Somalia.\r\nThe theme for our debate this year, “The post-\r\n2015 development agenda: setting the stage”, is most \r\nappropriate. In the year 2000, the commitment was \r\nmade by world leaders in the Millennium Declaration \r\nto eradicate extreme poverty and adopt the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The MDGs are measurable \r\nand achievable targets that were specifically crafted to \r\naddress the most pressing development needs of the \r\nmost vulnerable countries. The full implementation of \r\nthe MDGs remains the key priority on the development \r\nagenda for the next two years.\r\nA development agenda for beyond 2015 should \r\nallow individual regions and States the space to \r\naddress the development needs peculiar to their \r\ncircumstances and priorities. For Africa in particular, \r\nthe future development agenda should address poverty \r\neradication, income inequality and job creation. We \r\nfurthermore believe that the new development agenda \r\ncan be effective only if it is focused on all three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development, namely, the \r\neradication of poverty through economic development, \r\nsocial development and environmental sustainability.\r\nWe also wish to emphasize that any development \r\nagenda beyond 2015 must be based on the principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities in \r\norder to equalize the international playing field. We \r\nraise this point out of our concern that the global \r\neconomic meltdown seems to have brought about new \r\ndevelopments that are detrimental to the developing \r\nworld, especially Africa. Some of the new developments \r\ninclude the tendency to renegotiate the rules of the \r\ngame. New issues are being introduced as prerequisites \r\nfor development and partnerships and have, in fact, \r\n50/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nNations stood by South Africa, we would like to see the \r\nOrganization be at the forefront of efforts towards self-\r\ndetermination for the peoples of Palestine and Western \r\nSahara.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about continued illegal \r\nsettlement activities in the West Bank in violation of \r\ninternational law. Such illegal settlement activities \r\njeopardize the realization of the two-State solution.\r\nThe Cuban people also hold a special place in our \r\nhearts because of that country’s sacrifice for African \r\npeoples in their quest for freedom. We will therefore \r\ncontinue to struggle with them for their economic \r\nliberation.\r\nAt its sixty-eighth session the General Assembly \r\nwill undertake critical work for the future of our people. \r\nLet us tackle the work ahead in such a manner that when \r\nfuture generations look back on this moment, they will \r\nbe able to say that the leaders of this generation laid the \r\nfoundation for the eradication of poverty, for building a \r\nglobal society of equality, and for world peace.\r\nLet me borrow from the words of our former \r\nPresident Nelson Mandela on his inauguration day in \r\n1994 when he said:\r\n“We understand it still that there is no easy \r\nroad to freedom. We know it well that none of \r\nus acting alone can achieve success. We must \r\ntherefore act together as a united people, for \r\nnational reconciliation, for nation-building, for the \r\nbirth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. \r\nLet there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, \r\nwater and salt for all. Let each know that for each \r\nthe body, the mind and the soul have been freed to \r\nfulfil themselves.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, President  \r\nof Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nWhen discussing the Security Council, the matter \r\nof the Syrian Arab Republic comes into focus. We have \r\nexpressed our dismay at the use of chemical weapons \r\nin Syria. There is no cause that could justify the use \r\nof weapons of mass destruction by anyone under any \r\ncircumstances. It is, however, our strongly held view \r\nthat any political transition in Syria must come about as \r\na result of the will of the Syrian people and not through \r\nthe force of arms.\r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, \r\nsuch as the decision by Syria to accede to the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention and the ongoing bilateral \r\nconsultations between the Russian Federation and \r\nthe United States. We support all of the diplomatic \r\nefforts aimed at finding a solution to this matter. The \r\ninternational community has an opportunity to use the \r\nSyrian experience to ensure that matters of this nature \r\nare handled correctly going forward, using existing \r\ninstruments within the multilateral system of global \r\ngovernance.\r\nNext year South Africa will celebrate its twentieth \r\nanniversary of freedom and democracy. We will forever \r\nbe grateful to those in the international community, \r\nincluding the United Nations, who stood beside us in \r\nour long struggle for liberation. We look forward to \r\ncelebrating our anniversary of freedom with the United \r\nNations and to strengthening our partnership. A strong \r\npartnership with the United Nations is critical for the \r\nfuture we want for the people of South Africa. \r\nWe also take this opportunity to thank the United \r\nNations and the international community for their \r\nsupport during the recent hospitalization of our beloved \r\nfounding President of the free and democratic South \r\nAfrica, His Excellency Mr. Nelson Mandela. We thank \r\nthem for all for their support and good wishes. The \r\nUnited Nations declared 18 July, his birthday, as Nelson \r\nMandela International Day. That has become a catalyst \r\npromoting service to humankind worldwide. We \r\nthank the United Nations for that gesture. Our revered \r\nformer President continues to respond to treatment \r\nat his home. His family and our people have warmly \r\nwelcomed the support he continues to receive from the \r\nglobal community. We are humbled and very grateful \r\nfor that support.\r\nAs we celebrate our freedom and democracy, we \r\nremain mindful that our struggle is not complete until \r\nthe people of Palestine and Western Sahara enjoy \r\ntheir rights to self-determination. Just as the United \r\n13-48449 51/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nUkraine, which experienced the worst nuclear \r\naccident in the history of humankind, is well aware of \r\nthe priority importance of issues of ecological safety, \r\nthe comprehensive conservation of the environment \r\nand prudent management of water resources. We \r\nencourage Member States to intensify international \r\ninteraction in this field as part of their observation of \r\nthe International Year of Water Cooperation and the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of World Water Day.\r\nUkraine will continue to diligently do its part \r\nto achieve the Millennium Development Goals at \r\nthe national level. We are eager to establish positive \r\nmomentum on many key national development \r\nindicators. These indicators include poverty alleviation, \r\nquality education, environmental conservation, \r\nmaternal health improvement and child mortality \r\nreduction, among others. The leading catalyst for \r\nUkraine’s progress towards the Goals is the reform \r\nprogramme, which is the largest such programme in \r\nthe recent history of our country, aimed at both social \r\nand economic transformations as well as the further \r\nstrengthening of the democratic system and the rule of \r\nlaw. The fundamental basis for internal transformation \r\nin Ukraine will continue to be supremacy of the \r\nprinciple of social justice.\r\nWe also view Ukraine’s European integration \r\naspirations in the light of sustainable development. \r\nThese aspirations are a determining vector for the \r\ncountry’s development. Ukraine makes its contribution \r\nto the greater European project, which unites the \r\ninterests and development goals of the countries of the \r\nWest to those of the East of our continent. I strongly \r\nbelieve that the signing in November of the Association \r\nAgreement between Ukraine and the European Union, \r\nincluding the creation of a Deep and Comprehensive \r\nFree Trade Area, will be an important tool in raising \r\nthe welfare of Ukrainian citizens and will duly assist \r\nour country in achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.\r\nIt has long been broadly agreed that sustainable \r\ndevelopment is impossible without efficient international \r\nsecurity. Conversely, lasting peace is impossible \r\nwithout sustainable development. Events since last \r\nyear’s debate have clearly shown the inconsistency \r\nand instability of the world today. It is a world that, \r\ndespite our common efforts, has not embarked on a \r\nmore even and reliable trajectory of universal peace. \r\nOn the contrary, according to the Global Peace Index, \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Viktor Yanukovych, \r\nPresident of Ukraine, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Yanukovych (spoke in Ukrainian; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): First of all, \r\non behalf of Ukraine, I sincerely congratulate Mr. John \r\nWilliam Ashe on his election to serve as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. I wish \r\nhim success and fruitful work as he discharges this \r\nimportant role.\r\nThe theme of the present session, “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage”, is undoubtedly \r\nimportant for every Member State. The deadline for \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals is fast \r\napproaching, and the task of producing the ambitious \r\npost-2015 action plan is becoming ever more urgent \r\nfor the international community. I am glad that \r\npractical work on implementing that task has already \r\nbeen launched. Its current intensity is confirmed by \r\ntwo important events: the General Assembly special \r\nevent to follow up efforts made towards achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the inaugural \r\nmeeting of the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nI am convinced that the actions planned by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly will allow for \r\nsubstantial acceleration during the sixty-eighth session \r\nof the work on elaboration of development goals for the \r\nupcoming period. We consider the innovative national \r\nconsultations mechanisms, which are being successfully \r\napplied in the case of Ukraine, an important element \r\nof this work. Ukraine stands ready to be engaged fully \r\nand with maximum efficiency in these developments, \r\nwhich are extremely important for the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe topic of sustainable energy as an item of the \r\npost-2015 agenda is of particular significance to us. A \r\nnew, inclusive approach to that issue must ensure the \r\ncomprehensive consideration of security, social and \r\nenvironmental aspects. Only such an approach will \r\nfacilitate sustainable development of energy, especially \r\nas regards the efficiency and safety of the nuclear \r\nsector. That objective would be favoured by the further \r\ndevelopment of and joint action on the implementation \r\nof the outcomes of Kyiv Summit on the Safe and \r\nInnovative Use of Nuclear Energy, which was held in \r\nApril 2011.\r\n52/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nI believe that it is within our power to make the world \r\nsafer. The ideals of peace and the peaceful coexistence \r\nof nations are not hollow words for Ukraine but a clear \r\nguideline that has informed all of our actions on the \r\ninternational stage since we became independent. That \r\nimperative is at the heart of every step and initiative \r\ntaken by our country in the world arena. The fact \r\nthat this year Ukraine holds the chairmanship of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) — the largest international regional forum — is \r\na vivid example of that commitment. It is an honour \r\nfor us, and we view our responsible mission primarily \r\nas a mechanism for the consolidation of security and \r\nstability in Europe. \r\nThe Ukrainian chairmanship focuses in particular \r\non the settlement of protracted conflicts and the \r\nresumption of control over conventional weapons \r\nwithin the OSCE area, the combat against trafficking \r\nin human beings and other very pressing issues on the \r\nOrganization’s agenda. I wish to underline that in every \r\nsector I have mentioned, some limited but practically \r\nmeaningful progress has been achieved.\r\nUkraine has also been able to give added urgency \r\nto the issues of energy security and environmental \r\nsafety issues for the OSCE and take the issue of energy \r\nefficiency to a new level. I am confident that the \r\nsuccessful realization of the priorities of the Ukrainian \r\nchairmanship will allow for the intensifying of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the OSCE.\r\nThe year 2014 will mark the twentieth anniversary \r\nof Ukraine’s accession to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons as a non-nuclear-\r\nweapon State. By ridding the world of its third-largest \r\nnuclear arsenal, our country made an unprecedented \r\ncontribution to global nuclear disarmament. It was at \r\nthat time that Ukraine, the Russian Federation, Great \r\nBritain and the United States concluded the Budapest \r\nMemorandum on Security Assurances, joined later by \r\nFrance and China.\r\nIn view of the historical significance of those \r\nevents and considering the recent alarming trends in \r\nnuclear proliferation, Ukraine will initiate the holding, \r\nat the current session of the General Assembly, of a \r\nthematic conference. We expect that guarantor States, \r\ncountries that followed Ukraine’s example and other \r\ninterested parties will participate. I hope that this \r\ninternational event will be a good opportunity to come \r\nback to the issue of negative security assurances and \r\ngive it thorough consideration.\r\nour world has become less safe than it was five years \r\nago.\r\nOne of the most painful security problems of today \r\nis the civil conflict in Syria, which, unfortunately, is \r\nincreasingly crossing borders and becoming the source \r\nof threats on a regional scale. There is no justification \r\nfor bloodshed and suffering of the civilian population, \r\nincluding women and children, more than 1.5 million \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, and tens \r\nof thousands of foreign citizens who have found \r\nthemselves in danger. We must do everything in our \r\npower to allay the pain and to contain and heal the open \r\nwound of his conflict as soon as possible.\r\nIn our joint actions to settle the conflict, we have \r\nto rely on humanistic values, sobriety, competence and \r\nmutual responsibility. Ukraine has extended its helping \r\nhand to the Syrian population by rendering assistance \r\nthrough United Nations mechanisms. Today, we urge \r\nthe entire international community to take part in that \r\nhumanitarian mission.\r\nWe welcome the plan produced by Russia and \r\nthe United States to place the Syrian stockpiles of \r\nchemical weapons under the control of the international \r\ncommunity for their subsequent destruction. At the \r\nsame time, Ukraine is convinced that the successful \r\nimplementation of that plan would give hope for that \r\nconflict to be brought under control and leave space for a \r\npolitical and diplomatic settlement. It is time to promote \r\nthe establishment of as wide a platform as possible so as \r\nto reach, through multilateral negotiations, a political \r\nsolution that will make it possible to restore peace and \r\nstability in Syria.\r\nWith respect to pressing problems in the context \r\nof contemporary international security, I would like to \r\ndraw attention to the issue of cybersecurity, which is \r\nbecoming increasingly important given the development \r\nof the information society. Ukraine attaches great \r\nsignificance to that issue as well as to the development \r\nof up-to-date mechanisms to combat cybercrimes.\r\nWe believe that we should focus on strengthening \r\ncontrol over the use of the Internet and cyberspace for \r\ncriminal purposes and for other dangerous, primarily \r\nmilitary ends. I am convinced that this process should \r\nbe led by the United Nations. The United Nations is \r\nthe best instrument for transforming the Internet into a \r\nspace of freedom that works in the interests and to the \r\nbenefit of all nations throughout the world.\r\n13-48449 53/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nprogress in the modernization of the Security Council. \r\nWe have great concern about the present stagnancy of \r\nthe process.\r\nI would like to confirm once again the readiness \r\nof Ukraine to discuss all progressive concepts related \r\nto Security Council reform that could accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the long-overdue changes. We \r\nconsider that such reform must take into account the \r\nlegitimate interests of all regional groups, including the \r\nEastern European group. The countries of our region \r\nshould be allocated one additional non-permanent seat \r\nin an enlarged Security Council.\r\nAll preconditions have been met for the sixty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly to go down in \r\nhistory as one of the most fruitful in terms of the work \r\nof the United Nations, a key political body that is the \r\nmost representative of all world organizations. I am \r\nfirmly convinced that the community of nations is up \r\nto the task. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Ukraine for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Viktor Yanukovych, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajapaksa: At the outset, I offer my \r\ncondolences to the families whose loved ones died as \r\na result of the terrorist attack on a shopping mall in \r\nKenya. Having suffered many terrorist attacks over \r\nnearly three decades, we Sri Lankans condemn this \r\ncowardly act.\r\nThe United Nations has consistently ensured \r\ncooperation among States and provided a universal \r\nWe stress that security assurances for those States \r\nthat gave up their nuclear arsenals and countries that \r\nare not part of military unions must be reflected in a \r\nlegally binding international document.\r\nWe look forward to the holding of a successful \r\nNuclear Security Summit in The Hague next year. \r\nUkraine looks to that global forum to produce new \r\nqualitative outcomes and encourages all other countries \r\nto make appropriate contributions to that cause.\r\nUkraine, as a maritime State, deploys continuing \r\nefforts to secure maritime navigation safety and to \r\ncombat piracy at sea. The primary task in that field is to \r\nreinforce the efficacy of mechanisms for the prosecution \r\nof those guilty of perpetrating and financing piracy. \r\nWe will further contribute to the strengthening of \r\npeace through our active participation in United Nations \r\nmissions in hotspots throughout the world. In its more \r\nthan 20 years of participation in peacekeeping activities \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations, Ukraine has \r\ncontributed to more than 20 such operations. Today \r\nits agenda includes the consolidation and expansion \r\nof that experience in the context of the United Nations \r\nmissions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and \r\nCôte d’Ivoire.\r\nAt the same time, we cannot but take note of \r\nthe existing problems with respect to the current \r\npeacekeeping activities of our Organization. Along with \r\nother countries that are contributors of Blue Helmets, \r\nwe will continue to work to solve them, particularly as \r\nregards ensuring the mobility and safety of air operations \r\nas well as the legal protection of peacekeepers and the \r\ninvestigation of crimes committed against them.\r\nUkraine will make further significant practical \r\ncontributions aimed at making the world safer. To that \r\nend, we will use all available instruments, especially \r\nnon-permanent membership in the Security Council if \r\nour country is elected to that body for the period 2016-\r\n2017. I count on support for the candidacy of Ukraine \r\nin those elections.\r\nOur country is fully committed to the collective \r\nsecurity system enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The system, which has proved indispensable, \r\nwill remain the foundation of the world order.\r\nUkraine upholds President Ashe’s decisive \r\ndetermination to achieve long-expected practical \r\nadvances in the reform of the United Nations. We \r\nbelieve that it is critically important to achieve early \r\n54/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nSri Lanka’s sense of pride in our early recognition \r\nof the crucial role women play in political and \r\nsocioeconomic development is amply warranted, as we \r\nelected the world’s first female Prime Minister, the late \r\nMrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike. Sri Lanka was ranked \r\nsixteenth in the Global Gender Gap Report 2010.\r\nSri Lanka has mainstreamed the issue of youth in \r\nits post-2015 development agenda and is at the forefront \r\nof international efforts advocating the interests of \r\nyouth. Sri Lanka will be hosting the Commonwealth \r\nYouth Forum 2013 in November and the United Nations \r\nWorld Conference on Youth in May 2014. I take this \r\nopportunity to extend an invitation to all Member States \r\nto join in celebrating youth at the World Conference. \r\nI also call upon the United Nations to declare an \r\ninternational skills day as recognition of the way in \r\nwhich skills development for youth paves the way for \r\nreduced poverty. An innovative development has been \r\nthe establishment of a Youth Parliament to sharpen \r\nthe awareness of democracy and skills among the new \r\ngeneration and prepare them to assume leadership.\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that Member States \r\nindividually decide on their own means to achieve \r\nthe MDGs. The unique sociocultural practices and \r\ntraditions of countries should be taken into account \r\nwhen designing these processes.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda needs to be an \r\nintergovernmental process, in line with the outcomes \r\nand agreed principles of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (Rio+20). Centuries of \r\ngrowth in advanced economies have left little carbon \r\nspace for the developing world, thus challenging their \r\ngrowth. The thin line on which economic development \r\nand protection of the environment must be balanced \r\nwill remain a great challenge in future development \r\npolicy-setting. It is therefore critical that developed \r\ncountries honour their commitments and compensate \r\nfor their damage to the environment on the basis of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities.\r\nThe eradication of poverty must be the primary \r\ngoal of the post-2015 development agenda and must \r\npromote accelerated economic growth in developing \r\ncountries. Ensuring sustainable growth with social \r\nequity demands a balanced approach to development. \r\nHigh rates of investment, efforts to strengthen the \r\nquality of human capital and technology transfers are \r\ncrucial for sustainable growth.\r\nplatform for discussions on a range of issues, contentious \r\nor otherwise. It is imperative that we jealously protect \r\nand abide by the principle of equal treatment of countries \r\nthat has been the very basis of this global Organization. \r\nBe it on economic or political issues, equality must \r\nform the bedrock of all international interactions.\r\nReflecting on the work of the United Nations, we \r\nnote that matters of a political nature have overridden \r\nthe most basic issues that affect the underprivileged \r\nand marginalized who make up the majority of \r\nworld society. The commitment to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) brought about a real sense \r\nof optimism. The theme for this session is timely, as \r\nprogress in the MDGs should be evaluated, with their \r\ndeadline fast approaching.\r\nAppreciable progress has been made in the MDGs, \r\nalthough the results are uneven among and within \r\ncountries. According to World Bank projections, by \r\n2015 sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia will be home \r\nto approximately 40 per cent of the developing world’s \r\npopulation living in extreme poverty. This diminishes \r\nour sense of optimism. It is fitting for the United \r\nNations system to examine the causes of the failure in \r\nimproving the lot of the deprived.\r\nIn the context of Sri Lanka, my vision has been to \r\ndistribute the benefits of growth across all segments \r\nof the population and to prevent inequalities, social \r\nexclusion and adverse environmental effects. The \r\nsocioeconomic achievements in my country are the \r\nresult of people-centric Government policies.\r\nDespite the fact that my country has had to \r\ncontend with one of the most ruthless terrorist groups \r\nin the world, the 2004 tsunami and the global food, \r\nenergy and financial crises, Sri Lanka’s attainment \r\nof the MDGs is exemplary. The statistics speak for \r\nthemselves. Sri Lanka was ranked ninety-second out of \r\n187 countries in the 2012 Human Development Index. \r\nAbsolute poverty in Sri Lanka declined to 6.5 per cent \r\nin 2012 from 15.2 per cent over a period of five years, \r\nsurpassing the MDG mid-term target.\r\nThe goal of universal primary education will be \r\neasily achieved by 2015. The key dividend from this \r\nstrong educational infrastructure has been a drastic \r\nreduction in the unemployment level. Sri Lanka’s \r\naccomplishments in health care include an infant \r\nmortality rate of 9.4 per 1,000 live births, highlighted \r\nby UNICEF as a success story.\r\n13-48449 55/56\r\n24/09/2013 A/68/PV.5\r\nworld needs no policing by a few States, particularly \r\nwhen the United Nations is mandated to ensure \r\ninternational security through multilateral engagement. \r\nThat engagement, to be complete in our time, must \r\nensure the protection of the human race against the \r\nf lagrant abuse of modern science in such forms as \r\nnuclear and chemical weapons.\r\nDeepening uncertainties in the Middle East are \r\ndisturbing. We await the coexistence of Palestine and \r\nIsrael on the basis of pre-1967 borders. Sri Lanka looks \r\nforward to welcoming Palestine as a full Member of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe salute the people of Africa in their efforts \r\nto achieve better living conditions and economic \r\nprosperity. Sri Lanka continues to demonstrate \r\nsolidarity with the African people in their pursuit of \r\nfurther socioeconomic growth.\r\nUnilateral measures, such as embargoes and \r\neconomic sanctions imposed on countries, are \r\ndisturbing. Such initiatives bring suffering not only \r\nto those specifically targeted, but to a wide range of \r\nhumankind without any justification. Yet again, I \r\nstand in support of the people of Cuba in overcoming \r\neconomic hardships and in gaining full access to \r\neconomic opportunity.\r\nPermit me to address briefly the post-conflict \r\ndevelopments in my own country. I am proud that Sri \r\nLanka has eradicated separatist terrorism spanning \r\nthree decades and is in the process of addressing the \r\nissues of development and reconciliation. Sri Lanka’s \r\nGovernment, at all times responsive to the priorities \r\nreflected in public opinion, is engaged in all measures \r\nrequired for meaningful progress in those fields.\r\nA significant event in that regard was the \r\nopportunity that the people of Northern province \r\nenjoyed at the elections, held three days ago, to elect \r\ntheir representatives in the provincial council. It is a \r\nmatter of legitimate satisfaction to me that this was \r\nmade possible after the lapse of almost a quarter of a \r\ncentury. There can be no doubt regarding the crucial \r\nimportance of that measure in the context of political \r\nempowerment and reconciliation. It is clearly the \r\nresponsibility of the international community to assist \r\nwith those efforts and to ensure their success for the \r\nbenefit of all the people of Sri Lanka.\r\nIn spite of the visible progress made and consistent \r\nengagement with United Nations mechanisms, \r\nmany countries are surprised at the disproportionate \r\nThe mechanisms on financing and technology \r\nmandated by Rio+20 need to be urgently implemented. \r\nThe sustainable development financing strategy, in its \r\nformulation, must seek to provide for enhanced and \r\npredictable financial support to developing countries. \r\nSri Lanka supports the establishment of a technology \r\nfacilitation mechanism under the United Nations, \r\nrecommended in the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/67/348). The mighty advocates of rights-based \r\napproaches should also honour their international \r\ncommitments relating to development financing.\r\nCalls for reforms in the current international \r\nfinancial institutions continue to be relevant. Their ad \r\nhoc policies have proven to be untenable in the long \r\nrun. It is imperative for the international monetary and \r\nfinancial institutions to give expression to the solid \r\nvoice of the developing world. Also, those countries that \r\nare economically blessed must shed their practice of \r\nleveraging through those institutions. A comprehensive \r\nstructural reform of the existing imperfect global \r\neconomic order needs to be fully addressed to reflect \r\ncurrent realities.\r\nThe world is in need of a fair international economic \r\nsystem to revitalize partnerships for development. \r\nThat includes State and non-State actors and blue \r\nchip companies emerging as new partners. Moreover, \r\nSouth-South cooperation is crucial due to the shift in \r\neconomic power and should be actively promoted to \r\ncomplement North-South cooperation.\r\nIt is disturbing to observe the growing trend in \r\nthe international arena of interference by some in the \r\ninternal matters of developing countries in the guise \r\nof ensuring security and guarding human rights. \r\nTherefore, we continue to witness agitation the world \r\nover, leading to violence and forcing political change \r\naccompanied by turmoil. It is time to contemplate \r\nwhether such movements have led to better stability \r\nin those countries or produced different results due \r\nto inappropriate external factors. In fact, the positive \r\noutcomes envisaged by those responsible have not \r\ncome to pass, but indeed contributed to making those \r\ncountries unstable. Do unilateral or group actions not \r\nerode the authority of the Security Council?\r\nThat trend needs to be arrested, as it has now \r\nextended into areas where it is detrimental to the well-\r\nbeing of populations. The turmoil results from attempts \r\nto impose a type of democracy upon countries with \r\nsignificantly different cultures, values and history. The \r\n56/56 13-48449\r\nA/68/PV.5 24/09/2013\r\nnatho” — “You are your own master.” Let those timeless \r\nwords of wisdom guide the destiny of the world. May \r\nthe Noble Triple Gem bless us all. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.40 p.m.\r\nemphasis on Sri Lanka and its unequal treatment in the \r\nmultilateral framework. The basis for that relentless \r\npursuit is also questioned. It is my conviction that the \r\nUnited Nations system should be astute in ensuring the \r\nconsistency of standards applied so that there is no room \r\nfor suspicion of manipulation of the United Nations \r\nsystem by interested parties to fulfil their agendas.\r\nBy nature, human beings have the capacity to \r\nachieve the most challenging and noble goals in life \r\nthrough strong commitment and dedication. I am \r\nconfident that, by our own collective efforts, those \r\nresults will prove to be beneficial to all humankind. \r\nAs Buddha, the Enlightened One, said, “Atta hi attano \r\n"
