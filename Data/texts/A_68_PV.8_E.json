"In the absence of the President, Mr. Touré (Guinea), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.15 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Toomas \r\nHendrik Ilves, President of the Republic of Estonia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ilves: The central theme of the sixty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly is sustainable \r\ndevelopment. With its three main pillars this constitutes \r\na comprehensive agenda, even more comprehensive with \r\nall of its prerequisites: conflict prevention, bringing \r\npeace and security to war-torn countries and bringing \r\nperpetrators to justice through the implementation \r\nof international law. Helping the weakest to help \r\nthemselves, shaping economies that pay focused \r\nattention to social-agenda and environmental issues \r\nand that effectively use e-technologies, protecting \r\nhuman rights and supporting the rule of law and \r\ndemocracy — these are all integral parts of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda notes \r\nthat Governments bear the primary responsibility for \r\nassuring sustainable development and for improving the \r\nlives of people in their territories. Sustainability can be \r\ntruly implemented, however, only if we instil it in the \r\ncore thinking of Governments, societies, individuals \r\nand the international community as a whole.\r\nLet me start with what is clearly and without a \r\ndoubt the most unsustainable situation in the world at \r\nthe moment: the conflict in Syria. It has been repeated \r\nthousands and thousands of times, and must continue to \r\nbe repeated over and over again, that the use of chemical \r\nweapons is unacceptable under any circumstances \r\nand requires complete and unreserved condemnation. \r\nIt is clear that chemical weapons must be destroyed \r\nquickly and verifiably. Therefore the Organisation for \r\nthe Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the Security \r\nCouncil must — and I emphasize must — move forward \r\nand agree on the legally binding terms to resolve that \r\nissue, preferably under Chapter VII of the Charter, as \r\nsoon as possible.\r\nEven without the use of chemical weapons, the \r\nmilitary actions and brutality which have occurred in \r\nSyria have created suffering and a humanitarian disaster \r\nof unimaginable proportions. More than 110,000 \r\npeople have been killed, and millions of refugees and \r\ninternally displaced persons are scattered around the \r\nUnited Nations A/68/PV.8\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-eighth session\r\n8th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 25 September 2013, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Ashe  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Enormous \r\namounts of money and resources are spent on arms, \r\noften at the expense of far more vital needs. We view \r\nthe adoption in June of the Arms Trade Treaty, within \r\nthe framework of the United Nations, as a historic \r\nmilestone for the world community.\r\nAs a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity, Estonia strongly supports and contributes \r\nto the activities of the International Criminal Court \r\nand the ad hoc tribunals established by the Security \r\nCouncil. We continue to call for more States to ratify \r\nthe Rome Statute and the amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute relating to the crime of aggression. Universality \r\nis key to ensuring that the perpetrators of the worst \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community are \r\nheld accountable. Accountability and the prevention \r\nof atrocities have been the priorities of Estonia as a \r\ncurrent member of the Human Rights Council. In the \r\nCouncil, we also focus on the rights of women and \r\nchildren and on their disproportionate suffering during \r\narmed conflict.\r\nThe post-2015 sustainable development agenda \r\nshould transform the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) into Sustainable Development Goals. In the \r\nmeantime, we have learned that the MDGs should \r\nhave focused more on reaching the poorest and most-\r\nexcluded groups in society. The main challenge of the \r\npost-2015 negotiations will be to formulate and reach \r\nglobal agreement on one concrete and measurable \r\nset of development goals that would keep the three \r\ndimensions of sustainability in its core and maintain a \r\nstrong focus on poverty eradication. The targets should \r\nleave no one behind and be applicable and achievable \r\nin every country.\r\nIn many societies, women and girls are the main \r\ndrivers of development. Not allowing them to fulfil their \r\npotential through education, decent job opportunities \r\nand essential health services is to disregard the \r\npotential of one half of humankind. It is also important \r\nto remember that persons with disabilities have been \r\none of the most excluded segments of our societies, \r\nalthough they often have serious difficulties with access \r\nto basic social services and decent job opportunities.\r\nregion. About 7 million Syrians are in urgent need of \r\nassistance.\r\nWhile there is no quick or easy fix to that complex \r\nsituation, we must keep doing what we can to ease \r\nhuman suffering. Estonia is one of many countries that \r\nhave been focusing on helping those who have been \r\nforced to f lee from their homes and protecting the most \r\nvulnerable members of society: women and children. I \r\nwould also like to praise the good work of UNICEF, the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nand humanitarian workers in Syria who often by risking \r\ntheir own lives, have been able to organize and deliver \r\nassistance.\r\nEvidence collected by the Human Rights Council’s \r\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry \r\nindicates that war crimes, crimes against humanity and \r\ngross human rights violations have been systematically \r\ncommitted in Syria. Estonia is among the countries \r\nthat joined the Swiss initiative in January, asking the \r\nSecurity Council to refer the situation in Syria to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. It is the responsibility of \r\nthe international community to protect, if a Government \r\nfails to do so.\r\nIn contrast, let me turn to a country and conflict \r\nwhere hope has been restored recently. That presidential \r\nelections in Mali were carried out in a peaceful and \r\ntransparent manner has paved the way for optimism. \r\nThe newly elected President has many important tasks \r\nahead, beginning with reconciliation between the \r\nsouthern and northern parts of Mali. I wish Mr. Keita all \r\nthe luck and energy he will need to rebuild his country, \r\nand I can assure him that Estonia stands among the \r\ncountries that will continue to help if needed.\r\nI venture to say that another country whose \r\nfuture looks promising is Afghanistan. I believe that \r\nresponsibility and ownership make people masters \r\nof their own fate, and I can see the willingness of \r\nAfghans to avail themselves of that opportunity. The \r\ninternational community must continue to assist that \r\ncountry in order to ensure that their efforts will bear \r\nfruit. As a long-term partner of Afghanistan, Estonia \r\nremains committed to assisting with the training and \r\nfinancing of Afghan security forces after 2014, while \r\ncontinuing to support educational progress, women’s \r\nempowerment, the rule of law and health care.\r\nIt is also sadly true that conflicts can at times \r\nbe alarmingly sustainable. For years, Estonia has \r\n13-48557 3/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\ncountries have joined our 2008 initiative “Let’s Do It!” \r\nto make people’s environments cleaner and our planet \r\nenvironmentally happier.\r\nLet us remain alert and tuned in to every single \r\ndetail that prevents us from advancing our common \r\nwell-being, be it in developed or in developing countries. \r\nLet us be united in that common effort.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Estonia for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama.\r\nMr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ricardo \r\nMartinelli Berrocal, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Martinelli Berrocal (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt is a great honour for my country to congratulate \r\nMr. Ashe upon his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. He can count on \r\nthe unconditional support of the delegation of Panama \r\nduring his tenure. We cannot think of a more appropriate \r\ntheme for this high-level debate than to focus on “The \r\npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage”. \r\nThe theme invites us to reaffirm our commitment to \r\ncontinuing to work towards an agreement on the new \r\ndevelopment agenda. The agenda will be available for \r\nour people and the planet. \r\nThe 13 years that have elapsed since we identified \r\na way to achieve development through the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have witnessed the fastest \r\nreduction in poverty in the history of mankind. In \r\nthat connection, we as Panamanians have had great \r\npleasure in carrying out studies indicating that half a \r\nbillion fewer people now live below the poverty line, \r\nOfficial development assistance will continue to \r\nplay an important role in the sustainable development \r\nof many countries in the future, but it cannot compete \r\nwith the f low of international private investment nor \r\nwith domestically mobilized resources. Therefore, \r\nsynergies between different sources of finance, \r\nbetter policies and strong national ownership are \r\nnecessary. Nonetheless, the main drivers of sustainable \r\ndevelopment are inclusive and responsible economic \r\npolicies. A key enabler of growth is the bold use of \r\nmodern integrated circuit technology solutions. They \r\npromote better governance, access to public services, \r\njob creation, transparency, accountability and civil \r\nsociety participation.\r\nThat brings me to two issues of worldwide \r\nimportance: cybersecurity and Internet freedom. The \r\ntwo are intrinsically linked and in no way incompatible. \r\nMoreover, they will require a multi-stakeholder model \r\nof Internet governance. Freedom of opinion and \r\nexpression, online or off line, is a cornerstone of every \r\ndemocracy and constitutes a fundamental human right. \r\nLast year, the Human Rights Council affirmed that very \r\nsame principle. I am glad that the United Nations Group \r\nof Governmental Experts on Cyber Issues affirmed that \r\ninternational law is essential in promoting an open, \r\nsecure and accessible cyberspace.\r\nIn our fight against cybercrime, it is essential to raise \r\nawareness and to work on prevention by everyone, from \r\nprivate computer users to large critical infrastructure \r\nand cloud providers. Raising the awareness of political \r\nleaders and national governments is equally important; \r\ncybercrime may have serious consequences for national \r\nsecurity as well as national wealth. Yet the Council of \r\nEurope’s 2001 European Cybercrime Treaty — renamed \r\nthe Convention on Cybercrime because participants are \r\nfrom all over the world, and also known as the Budapest \r\nConvention — remains thus far the only legally binding \r\ninternational instrument that addresses cybercrime. \r\nNeedless to say, the more countries accede to it, the \r\nmore functional it will become. We find it odd that \r\nthose countries with the largest sources of cybercrime \r\nhave not acceded to the Convention, while in other \r\nareas they stress the primacy of international law.\r\nThe United Nations has had and will continue to \r\nhave a leading role in making the world sustainable. Yet \r\nGovernments can do and must do their own fair share. \r\nEstonia, for example, proudly continues to support the \r\ninitiatives of civil society in contributing to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Approximately one half of the world’s \r\n4/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nthat development that is not sustainable is simply not \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe MDGs were silent on conflict and the effect \r\nof violence on global development, nor was the impact \r\nand importance of institutions that guarantee freedom \r\nof expression and the rule of law for development \r\nincluded. The Government of the Republic of Panama \r\nbelieves that we need to integrate the economic, social \r\nand environmental aspects of development more \r\nsustainably. For that we support the efforts resulting \r\nfrom decisions made at the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development in Rio de Janeiro and the \r\nwork resulting from the meetings convened for the \r\nestablishment of the High-level Political Forum.\r\nGlobal inequality is still prevalent and very much \r\na part of this conversation. Some 1.2 billion people \r\naccount for only 1 per cent of global consumption. The \r\nRepublic of Panama has successfully reformed its trade, \r\ntax policies and transparency. In the same manner, we \r\nhave reviewed the regulation of our financial markets \r\nand productivity. As a result, we have, as far as possible, \r\ncharted a successful path towards development. It is \r\nclear that now we face even greater challenges, different \r\nfrom the previous ones.\r\nFinancing development is not easy, but we have \r\na great capacity and the patterns of productivity are \r\nbecoming more sustainable and equitable. Panama \r\nsupports the view that the post-2015 agenda must make \r\nsustainable development a cornerstone and not leave \r\nanyone behind.\r\nThe original promise of the MDGs must be \r\nkept. The new route towards development must be \r\ntransformed from reducing poverty to ending extreme \r\npoverty. Furthermore, the fight against inequality must \r\nbe a substantial part of our development agenda and \r\nshould be measured by the social inclusion generated \r\nfrom economic growth. The promotion and protection \r\nof universal human rights must be an integral part of a \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nSimilarly, institutions and the rule of law must be \r\nevaluated as contributions toward the development of \r\ncountries. Equally, a sustainable planet is crucial not \r\njust for the growth of our peoples, but also for their \r\nsurvival. Finding a solution for global environmental \r\nproblems should be a priority of the development \r\nagenda. That is why we support the integration of \r\nsustainable development objectives into the post-2015 \r\nagenda.\r\nthat infant mortality rates have fallen by over 30 per \r\ncent, and that deaths owing to malaria have declined by \r\na quarter, among other things. \r\nPanama has presented three national reports on the \r\nMDGs. They have demonstrated our country’s progress \r\nin improving the living conditions of our population and \r\nin setting the issue of poverty as a priority on the social \r\nagenda and focusing the Government’s contribution \r\non achieving clear, concrete and measurable goals to \r\nreduce poverty and the inequality gap. We have made \r\nnotable progress in various areas. That is where we need \r\nto redouble our efforts so as to provide Panamanian \r\ncitizens with a better future and so that all may benefit \r\nfrom a better Panama.\r\nIn 2012, along with 17 other countries, Panama \r\nreceived the Americas Award for reducing poverty and \r\nhunger. On behalf of the people of Panama, we recently \r\naccepted an award from the United Nations Food and \r\nAgricultural Organization for reaching the goal of \r\neradicating extreme poverty and hunger, between \r\n1990 and 2015, by halving the number of people who \r\nsuffer from hunger and by reducing the prevalence of \r\nundernourishment by 50 per cent or more, with respect \r\nto the levels in 1990-1992, now below five per cent. We \r\nare pleased with the work we have done.\r\nFor the first time in history, humankind has the \r\ntechnological, economic and sociopolitical structures \r\nto eradicate extreme poverty. With an agenda for \r\ndevelopment coordinated between the public and \r\nprivate sectors and civil society, we can carry out \r\na meaningful process that makes a difference and \r\nreaches everybody. Because of its capacity and scope, \r\nthe United Nations has played a facilitating role, unlike \r\nthat of any other organization, in order to coordinate \r\nthe global conversation about development, and it has \r\na special responsibility to its Member States to provide \r\ninformation, analytical thinking and experience from \r\nthe field.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for establishing a United Nations task force \r\nand in particular for convening the High-level Panel \r\nof Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development \r\nAgenda, whose extraordinary efforts are now giving us \r\nmore insights into a more productive discussion about \r\nwhat path we should follow. The post-2015 agenda \r\nshould focus on eradicating extreme poverty from the \r\nface of the Earth within a set time frame. Countries have \r\nlearned much about development. We have realized \r\n13-48557 5/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\ndeath to every species on the planet. The number of \r\ninterested parties in the Middle East with nuclear power \r\nand the capacity to introduce and test weapons of mass \r\ndestruction in a conflict situation is sufficiently large \r\nthat those of us gathered here cannot afford to ignore \r\nwhat is happening there. This is no time to hide our \r\nheads in the sand like ostriches, thinking that we can \r\nthereby stave off the danger that threatens us and save \r\nour lives. It is rather the moment to firmly demonstrate \r\nour collective responsibility to defend world peace and \r\nlife itself.\r\nI wish to inform the General Assembly that \r\nmy Government is aware of a request made by the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Nicaragua to the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf, \r\nestablished under the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea, to extend its continental shelf beyond \r\n200 nautical miles. Without objecting to the right of \r\nthe Republic of Nicaragua to make such a request, as \r\nstated in paragraph 8 of article 76 of the Convention, \r\nmy Government wishes to express its strong concern \r\nabout the fact that the coordinates given in Nicaragua’s \r\napplication constitute an unquestionable infringement \r\non our maritime space and on treaties between the \r\nRepublic of Panama and its neighbours, resulting in \r\na reduction of our maritime area of 49,892.54 square \r\nkilometres. \r\nThe serious concern on the part of the people \r\nand the Government of Panama is not motivated by \r\nNicaragua’s request to extend its continental shelf but \r\nrather because, despite the fact that our two countries \r\nare connected through friendship, geographic and \r\nregional proximity and political and economic \r\nintegration, we were not consulted before the request \r\nwas made, so that we could consider all of its possible \r\neffects. The Republic of Panama, in accordance with \r\nits national Constitution, complies with the standards \r\nof international law and has always recognized the \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as one \r\nway of achieving the pacific settlement of disputes, \r\nas laid out in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nIn that regard, we should also emphasize that \r\naccording to article 59 of the Statute of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, the decisions handed down by the \r\nworld’s highest universal tribunal should neither benefit \r\nnor harm third parties. My Government is therefore \r\ncompelled to categorically reject the Republic of \r\nNicaragua’s attempt to delimit its maritime boundaries \r\nPanamanians believe that unless we forge a \r\nglobal partnership, nothing we say in this Hall will be \r\neffective. We need a new spirit of mutual accountability \r\nthat supports the post-2015 agenda and the work done \r\nby the United Nations towards that end. There is no \r\ndoubt that the post-2015 agenda will depend on new \r\neconomic partnerships and financing.\r\nThe post-2015 agenda cannot possibly succeed \r\nwithout the active support of the Group of 20 and the \r\ninstitutions of economic cooperation and governance, \r\nsuch as the International Monetary Fund and the World \r\nTrade Organization. The General Assembly has been \r\ngiven an historic opportunity to promote a platform for \r\nglobal development, with so many leaders present here, \r\ntogether, with only one theme in mind. We believe that \r\neffective political leadership emanating from the high-\r\nlevel event on the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nits forum can give us decisive momentum to make a \r\nlegitimate change to our post-2015 agenda.\r\nAs we ponder the post-2015 development agenda, we \r\ncannot set aside the purpose for which this Organization \r\nwas created, namely, to ensure the maintenance of \r\nworld peace, through undivided and full respect for the \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of all people \r\non Earth, without any discrimination. \r\nIn that regard, we cannot let this moment pass without \r\nexpressing the deep concern that Panama shares with \r\nmany members of the Assembly on the grave situation \r\nin Syria. We condemn, in the strongest terms, the use \r\nof chemical weapons against the civilian population \r\nof Syria. We share the view that such acts constitute \r\na crime against humanity that should be investigated \r\nand punished in accordance with the norms of existing \r\ninternational law. We firmly call upon all members of \r\nthe Security Council to assume their responsibilities to \r\nensure compliance with international humanitarian law \r\nand international protection of the human rights of the \r\nSyrian people.\r\nWe are concerned about the escalating violence in \r\nthe Middle East and the veiled and open threats of the \r\nuse of nuclear weapons, which infringe on the right of \r\ncountries and peoples to live in peace in their territories. \r\nOur global Organization has the supreme duty to speak \r\nforcefully and clearly in support of world peace and the \r\nright of humankind to continue living on our planet. \r\nIn this crucial time for life and survival on Earth, we \r\nmust not fall into the habit of believing that nothing \r\nserious is happening and that life will still go on after \r\nthe atomic mushroom cloud delivers its final verdict of \r\n6/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nAs President of a sovereign nation, I have not \r\ncome before this forum to demand action against the \r\ncountries involved in the incident. Panama simply \r\ndesires and requests recognition that our conduct was \r\nbased on our firm wish to comply with the rules that the \r\nOrganization has laid down. We will respect the results \r\nof the investigation, and we wish to make it clear that \r\nPanama has no issue with the States involved in the \r\nmatter, which is why its settlement is not a bilateral one. \r\nWe Panamanians did our duty, and the United Nations \r\nmust now also do its duty, at a time when following \r\nthe rule of law is the only way to solve the delicate \r\ninternational problems that threaten the peaceful and \r\nhuman coexistence of the peoples of the world. \r\nPanama and its people anxiously await just \r\nrecognition of their act, which we see as an important \r\nprecedent for our hemisphere. We call on the \r\ninternational community to implement programmes \r\nand solutions conducive to peace. Panama reaffirms \r\nits historical position that we should use the tools of \r\nmediation and dialogue to deal with all current conflicts \r\nin the region and to seek solutions that defend and \r\nprotect the right of peoples to live and work in peace.\r\nSince the end of my term is approaching and this \r\nis the last address I will give to the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to say that I feel the satisfaction of a task \r\ncompleted as I leave Panama in the place it now occupies \r\nin the world. We leave behind a legacy of social and \r\npolitical stability and sustained high economic growth \r\nthroughout the Latin American region, and we have \r\nhelped to promote and build the common welfare of the \r\nPanamanian nation. \r\nI would like to cite some favourable statistics that \r\nillustrate our growth and social welfare, published by \r\nentirely credible international entities. On the index \r\nof human development for 2012, according to the \r\nUnited Nations, Panama is classified as a country of \r\nhigh human development, scoring 0.780 as compared \r\nto the average for Latin America, which is 0.741, and \r\nfor the world as a whole, which is 0.694. In a country \r\nof 3.63 million inhabitants, 1.83 million are men and \r\n1.79 million are women, according to the United Nations \r\nHuman Development Report 2013. On the literacy \r\nindex, Panama is at 94.1 per cent, also according to \r\nthe Human Development Report 2013. Panama invests \r\n4.6 per cent of its gross national product in public \r\nexpenditures for culture and health, the highest level \r\nin Central America, according to the Genral Treasury \r\nof the Republic. Average life expectancy in my country \r\nin this manner, since it violates existing treaties with \r\nthe Republic of Panama that we have complied with in \r\ngood faith, as well as our legitimate maritime rights, \r\nrecognized and accepted by the international community \r\nin that area. In accordance with international law, I \r\nwill produce all the necessary evidence to correct the \r\nRepublic of Nicaragua’s efforts in this matter. But on \r\nthe occasion of the current session, officials from both \r\nour countries have begun the process of resolving our \r\ndisagreement, which I hope will soon reach a happy \r\nconclusion.\r\nToday I also wish to mention a third issue that is \r\nvery important to Panama, the case of the merchant \r\nvessel MV Chong Chon Gang, sailing under the North \r\nKorean f lag, detained in Panama since mid-July. My \r\ncountry, as a State Member of this international forum, \r\ncomplies with the norms and regulations of its internal \r\nbodies, and article 4 of our Constitution requires \r\nPanama to comply with the norms of international law. \r\nThat mandate has governed all of our acts as a nation. \r\nThe vessel in question was transporting undeclared \r\nwar materiel from the Republic of Cuba destined for \r\nNorth Korea. Acting on intelligence that we obtained, \r\nwe detained the vessel before its transit through the \r\nCanal on the suspicion that the cargo contained drugs. \r\nWhen the ship was seized, an enormous amount of war \r\nmateriel — which, by definition and because of its \r\ndestination, clearly violated Security Council Sanctions \r\nCommittee mandates — was discovered hidden under \r\n200 tons of raw sugar.\r\nIn compliance with the mandates in question, my \r\nGovernment notified a panel of experts and invited \r\nthem to Panama to verify the findings and confirm our \r\ninitial impression, as presented by the drugs prosecutor \r\nwho initiated the investigation under the Republic of \r\nPanama’s laws. The panel inspected the cargo and \r\nlater made a preliminary report in accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. The evidence is now with \r\nthe Security Council. My Government would like to \r\nemphasize the significance of the action it took, not just \r\nas a Member State but also in its promotion of respect \r\nfor the decisions of this body and of the peaceful \r\ncoexistence of nations. We are talking here about an \r\nunprecedented and possibly unique situation, at least \r\non our continent, which is why I stress its importance \r\ntoday. Panama complied with its duty as a Member State, \r\neven in the face of possible risks, high material costs \r\nand potential consequences to be defined in accordance \r\nwith Panamanian law, as outlined in Security Council \r\nresolutions 1718 (2006), 1874 (2009) and 2094 (2013).\r\n13-48557 7/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nrespect both to humanitarian actors and to the United \r\nNations system, and expresses our full support for their \r\nefforts on behalf of those most in need.\r\nI am an optimistic man. I believe in human \r\nintelligence and in the capacity of our species to \r\nrecognize errors and dangers in order to change course \r\nand ensure our continuity on this planet. Moreover, \r\nthe nation of men and women of which I am the leader \r\nshares the dreams of a world united by its respect \r\nfor life and by the way it values and loves the vast \r\ncultural heritage that has been built by generation upon \r\ngeneration of people. I am convinced that however \r\ngreat the challenges and dangers that lie in wait for \r\nus may be, we will know how to meet and overcome \r\nthem with courage and intelligence. Nevertheless, I feel \r\ncompelled to mention the great dangers that surround \r\nus today. Only through concerted, responsible action \r\nwill we be able to overcome the difficult hour that faces \r\nhumankind.\r\nToday, multilateralism itself is being sorely tested. \r\nWe are facing one of the most serious and decisive \r\nmoments in the history of the planet and the human \r\nrace. At this unprecedented moment, the Organization \r\nwill have to take serious decisions in order to honour its \r\nresponsibility to our peoples with concrete results. The \r\nGovernments of the world need to focus their efforts \r\non raising the level of discussion so that our ambitious \r\ncontract with humankind and our planet can be fulfiled \r\nin time. Not to do so in the face of all the destructive \r\nforces that exist on the face of the Earth, and to allow \r\nthe passions that lead peoples and nations to conflict \r\nand war to be unleashed, would be to lose one of the last \r\nremaining opportunities for humankind. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Panama for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Ricardo Martinelli Berrocal, President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Alassane Ouattara, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire. \r\nis 76.3 years, according to the Human Development \r\nReport 2013.\r\nWhen it comes to the enjoyment of political rights, \r\nwe have a rating of 1 according to Freedom House in \r\n2012. Panama’s competitive ranking on the 2013 index \r\nof the World Economic Forum was forty-eighth out of \r\n148 countries reviewed, and its Fitch investment rating \r\nwas upgraded from BB+ to BBB, indicating a stable \r\nperspective. Our Moody’s rating was Baa2, a stable \r\nperspective, and according to Standard and Poors \r\nwe rose from BB+ to BBB, again indicating a stable \r\nperspective. \r\nThe latest United Nations Conference on Trade \r\nand Development report shows Panama as one of the \r\nhighest ranked Latin American countries for maritime \r\nconnectivity. According to the 2013 index, Panama \r\nimproved its score from 42.38 to 44.88, similar to \r\nMexico, which moved from 38.81 to 41.80, while \r\nBrazil dropped from 38.53 to 36.88. The United \r\nNations Economic Commission for Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean estimates that Paraguay leads Latin \r\nAmerican growth with an increase of 12.5 per cent \r\nin gross domestic product, followed by Panama, with \r\n7.5 per cent.The International Monetary Fund estimates \r\nregional gross domestic product growth in the region as \r\nfollows for 2013: Paraguay at 11 per cent and Panama \r\nat 9 per cent. In sum, Panama is on a firm path to full \r\ndevelopment, and with the support of the international \r\ncommunity we will continue responsibly to meet the \r\nchallenges that still face us in order to achieve the \r\nsustainable development for the well-being of all our \r\ncitizens.\r\nThe year 2013 has been one of great international \r\nevents for our country. We will soon have the honour for \r\nthe second time of hosting a Summit of the Americas, \r\nthe thirteenth, when Heads of State and Government \r\nwill discuss the Ibero-American community within \r\nthe new global context as it pertains to the political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural spheres. In November, \r\nwe will also host the forthcoming Conference of States \r\nParties to the United Nations Convention against \r\nCorruption, which reflects the priority that our country \r\naccords to the struggle against corruption as a factor \r\nin development. In a similar vein, we will continue to \r\nadvance projects for the establishment in our country \r\nof a regional hub for humanitarian assistance and \r\nof a regional centre of the United Nations for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. That project will serve as \r\nour contribution to the international community, with \r\n8/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nAlthough much remains to be done and the \r\nprogress made can mask various national and regional \r\nrealities, the current trend appears to be irreversible, \r\ndespite a particularly difficult economic environment. \r\nWe must seek to build on the positive outcomes that \r\nhave been achieved in a number of areas, such as \r\nprimary school enrolment, vaccinations and slowing \r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. We must also resolve issues \r\nof food security, drought, access to drinking water \r\nand combating poverty, which continue to be major \r\nconcerns for our States.\r\nBy adopting the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwe have the collective responsibility and ambition to \r\nimprove the living conditions of our fellow citizens and \r\nthereby accelerate the development of our countries. As \r\nfar as my country, Côte d’Ivoire, is concerned, progress \r\ntowards meeting the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich was deadlocked because of the sociopolitical \r\ncrisis, has today gained new momentum, thanks \r\nto the sound performance of our economy. It is in \r\nthat favourable climate that the Government has \r\nestablished an ambitious reconstruction programme, \r\nwhich is based on the national development plan for \r\nthe period 2012-2015. Social investments being a \r\npriority in that programme, the programme allocates \r\nsubstantial amounts to education, health and basic \r\nsocial infrastructure. The Government has also made \r\njob creation a national priority, in particular jobs for \r\nyoung people, and its goal is to create 200,000 jobs a \r\nyear, which is a considerable number given the size of \r\nour country. \r\nAs we assess what has been accomplished, we must \r\nface the fact that the world needs greater solidarity to \r\nreach the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore, \r\nwe must adopt a comprehensive approach that will \r\nenable our countries to create sustainable development \r\nmodels that are more equitable and more respectful \r\nof our differences. The African continent, which lags \r\nbehind in the effort to achieve the Goals by 2015, \r\ncan nevertheless count on an increasing share in the \r\nglobal economy because of its growth rate. My country \r\ntherefore supports the definition of a post-2015 agenda \r\nto forge a new consensus regarding a new generation \r\nof sustainable development goals, based on the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nThe world we seek will not come about unless \r\nwe meet the challenge of peace and security, as well \r\nas that of democracy, through a return to the values \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Too many wars \r\nMr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Alassane \r\nOuattara, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ouattara (spoke in French): Like the \r\nHeads of State and Government who have spoken \r\nbefore me, I would like, on behalf of the delegation of \r\nCôte D’Ivoire and on my own behalf, to address my \r\nsincere congratulations to Mr. Ashe on his outstanding \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-eighth session. I also wish in particular to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban ki-Moon for his leadership of \r\nthe Organization and his commitment to world peace \r\nand development. I take this opportunity to reiterate to \r\nhim, in the name of my counterparts in the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), our \r\ngratitude for his personal involvement in the resolution \r\nof conflicts in Africa and especially in the subregion of \r\nWest Africa.\r\nBefore touching on the topic of today’s debate, in \r\ntaking the f loor for the second time before the Assembly \r\nI would like to reaffirm the gratitude of the Ivorian \r\npeople for the efforts of the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community on our behalf. Indeed, thanks \r\nto that invaluable support, Côte d’Ivoire is now hard \r\nat work and has returned to the path of economic and \r\nsocial development for the well-being of all Ivorians. \r\nMy country is in a period of full reconstruction after \r\nestablishing credible and democratic institutions \r\nfollowing free, transparent elections. National \r\nreconciliation and political dialogue are under way in \r\na climate of peace. We are aware of the challenges that \r\nremain, but we are on the right path.\r\nThe theme for this session, “The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda: setting the stage”, calls on us all \r\nindividually and collectively to consider our capacity \r\nto meet the development challenge. As we approach \r\nthe 2015 target date for achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, it should be noted that significant \r\nprogress has been achieved by most countries, and \r\nwe welcome the determination of all Governments \r\nto continue their efforts to meet the Millennium \r\ncommitments. \r\n13-48557 9/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nI would like to encourage donors and our traditional \r\npartners to provide their support to the United Nations \r\nand to our States within the framework of this strategy. \r\nWe welcome the announcement of the upcoming visit \r\nof the Secretary-General and the President of the World \r\nBank to the Sahel region in order to mobilize the entire \r\ninternational community and the financial institutions. \r\nIf we want to end the cycle of politico-military \r\ncrises in West Africa, Guinea-Bissau must also receive \r\ninternational support, so that we can build upon the \r\ncurrent inclusive transition and enable the Government \r\nto organize democratic elections next November. For \r\nthat reason, on behalf of ECOWAS, I call upon the \r\ninternational community to contribute to the financing \r\nof general elections in that country.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIn closing, I would like to remind our Assembly that \r\nin order to meet the challenges of international peace \r\nand security, we must redouble our efforts to deliver on \r\nthe commitments made at United Nations conferences \r\nand summits. The right to development must become a \r\nreality for all, as set out in the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), which was unanimously adopted in \r\nSeptember 2000. We must all draw lessons from the \r\nshortcomings of the past in order to rebuild the world \r\ngloriously for ourselves, our children and our children’s \r\nchildren.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nand conflicts continue to tear humankind apart, \r\nundermining development efforts in numerous \r\ncountries. We must collectively put an end to that \r\nsituation by ensuring that we serve the interests of the \r\npeople exclusively, using the tools we already have. It \r\nis by renewing the foundations of our solidarity that we \r\nwill be able to counter new threats, such as terrorism, \r\ncross-border crime, drug and arms trafficking, human \r\ntrafficking and piracy at sea.\r\nThe attack of a rare violence that occurred in our \r\nbrother country, Kenya, is an example of those threats, \r\nand reminds us of the urgent need for collective action \r\nagainst the threat of terrorism. We condemn in the \r\nstrongest possible terms that despicable and barbarous \r\nact, which shows that the fight against terrorism is \r\nongoing and calls for new methods of security. In these \r\ntimes of great suffering, I would like, on behalf of my \r\ncountry and West Africa, to convey to the brotherly \r\npeople of Kenya and its President our compassion and \r\nsupport.\r\nInternational governance must become more \r\ndemocratic and increasingly embody the universal \r\nconsensus and the values  of our nations. Indeed, the \r\nworld must be able to recognize itself in its multilateral \r\ninstitutions in order to effectively deal with the hazards \r\nof this new century.\r\nWest Africa is aware of the threat posed to \r\nits development, the deterioration in the security \r\nenvironment and the proliferation of new factors of \r\ninstability. Accordingly, the Heads of State of ECOWAS \r\nare rightly doing everything possible, with the support \r\nof the international community, in a determined effort \r\nto re-establish and maintain peace in our region. For \r\nthat reason, we welcomed with the utmost satisfaction \r\nthe re-establishment of the territorial integrity of Mali \r\nand the successful holding of presidential elections in \r\nthat country. \r\nThat success must not hide the major challenges \r\nstill facing our region. I therefore call upon the \r\ninternational community to learn from the conflict in \r\nMali and to support ECOWAS and the African Union in \r\nimplementing a coherent and proactive security policy. \r\nTerrorism in the Sahel region is spreading to such an \r\nextent that entire expanses are outside the authority of \r\nStates. The threat goes beyond the borders of the African \r\ncontinent and demands a concerted international \r\nresponse in keeping with the stakes involved. \r\n10/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nmaritime delimitation dispute with Chile in the most \r\nconstructive and cooperative way possible, through a \r\nmutual commitment to abiding by and enforcing the \r\njudgment to be rendered by the International Court of \r\nJustice. This process will, I trust, transform the very \r\nnature of our relationship into a profitable and enduring \r\ncoexistence for the future of our neighbouring peoples.\r\nThe rule of law and its principles in the conduct of \r\ninternational affairs are therefore indispensable tools \r\nfor our conduct as members of the community of peoples \r\nof the United Nations. However, the greatest threat to \r\ninternational peace and security falls not in the realm \r\nof relations between States, but transcends them and \r\nmay even use them as tools for shadowy schemes. We \r\nare referring to terrorism, drug trafficking, organized \r\ncrime, mafias and corruption. All of these crimes pose \r\na genuine threat to life, progress and development, \r\naffecting primarily the poorest, which means that such \r\ncrimes are increasingly becoming the main obstacle to \r\nthe realization of the goals of the United Nations. \r\nThe underlying problems remain the same. Peru \r\ntherefore welcomes the fundamentally important \r\ntheme you have chosen, Sir, for our discussions — the \r\ndevelopment agenda for beyond 2015, which is the \r\ndeadline for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). \r\nOur country, happily, has made progress and \r\nattained some of the best benchmarks for achievement. \r\nSince 2000, according to United Nations Development \r\nProgramme indicators, we achieved certain goals early, \r\nin particular in the fight against poverty and extreme \r\npoverty, hunger, child mortality, and access to safe \r\ndrinking water. In 2000, more than half of Peruvians \r\nlived in poverty; today, only a quarter of my countrymen \r\nstill face that situation. Our goal is to reduce those \r\nliving in poverty to one fifth of our population by the \r\nend of my term, in 2016.\r\nWe have undertaken to realign the growth \r\nmodel by focusing on inclusion. In those efforts, the \r\nState is implementing a number of connected and \r\ninterdependent policies. It is worth underscoring the \r\nunprecedented measure of devoting expenditure to the \r\npoorest and most excluded through a range of social \r\nprogrammes aimed at improving the living standards \r\nof the population, enhancing education for children \r\nand young people and promoting gender equality and \r\naccess to health services, paying particular attention to \r\nthose in vulnerable situations.\r\nPresident Humala Tasso (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nam pleased to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session, and to welcome the fact that this lofty \r\nresponsibility has been entrusted to a dear friend from \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, a member of our community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. You can count \r\non the firm support of Peru in the execution of your \r\nwork.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express our respect for and \r\nsolidarity with the people of Mexico and Pakistan, \r\nwho are suffering as a result of natural disasters. I also \r\nwish to express the strong rejection and condemnation \r\nof the Government and people of Peru of the terrorist \r\nattack in Nairobi. We are relieved that this horrendous \r\nattack has come to an end. We express our unwavering \r\nsolidarity with the families of the victims and with the \r\nGovernment and people of Kenya at this difficult time.\r\nThe world is changing, the agenda is realigning, \r\nnew actors are emerging and new horizons are coming \r\ninto view for the future of humankind. All countries \r\nand peoples are affected by such rapid transformation. \r\nHowever, we note with concern that some fundamental \r\ntruths have not changed. Wars continue, mostly in new \r\nforms, emerging from the shadows and exacting an \r\never higher price from innocent populations.\r\nRegarding the Syrian tragedy, we express our \r\nsolidarity with the Syrian people. Peru condemns \r\nthe use of chemical weapons as unacceptable in all \r\ncircumstances. It is an affront to humankind and a clear \r\nviolation of international law. The Syrian people deserve \r\nan immediate solution to the bloody conflict ravaging \r\ntheir country. We therefore urge all parties involved to \r\nfind a peaceful and negotiated solution that respects the \r\nmechanisms for the settlement of disputes. We also call \r\non the Security Council to uphold its responsibility to \r\nmaintain international peace and security.\r\nAt the same time, inequality is becoming ever \r\nmore extreme. The gap marginalizing the poor from \r\nthe benefits of progress and development widens by the \r\nday, robbing them of the rights enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nIt is crucial for us to strengthen, renew and \r\nuphold our global commitment to developing peaceful \r\nrelations among peoples and to seeking solutions \r\nthat reject the use of force as means of solving our \r\nproblems. It is therefore particularly gratifying for Peru \r\nand a source of genuine pride that we addressed our \r\n13-48557 11/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nNon-traditional exports account for one third of \r\nour total exports — more than $11 billion dollars \r\ntoday — and service exports account for $5 billion. We \r\nare developing our immense potential for tourism.\r\nThe economic growth in recent years has been \r\nextraordinary, and I must say it has been the result of \r\nmuch effort, rigour and work, as well as democratic \r\ncontinuity and perseverance. Peru has managed both \r\nto avoid the worst effects of global instability and to \r\nattract levels of investment f lows that are unparalleled \r\nin our country’s history. Our task is to strengthen \r\nthe foundations that have enabled such growth, in \r\nparticular by strengthening democracy, institutions, \r\nthe rule of law and security, building citizenship and \r\nopening spaces for participation.\r\nWe have the means to do that, since we are a \r\ncountry of entrepreneurs: 98 per cent of our businesses \r\nare small or medium-sized. They employ 75 per cent \r\nof the economically active population and contribute \r\n42 per cent of the gross domestic product. Thanks \r\nto our efforts, Peru is now considered an emerging, \r\nmiddle-income country, with new middle classes and a \r\ngrowing domestic consumption, and it is able to attract \r\nlong-term investments for large projects.\r\nThanks to that and to the extent that we have \r\nstrengthened our national capacities, we will be \r\nable to encourage industrial policies geared towards \r\nchanging economic and social structures. For us, \r\nindustrialization is a national goal. In order to move in \r\nthat direction, in December Lima will host the fifteenth \r\nGeneral Conference of the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization.\r\nBeing centrally located on the map of South America \r\nand having played a key role in Latin American history, \r\nPeru views its region from the perspective of a country \r\nthat seeks consensus, both internal and external. Peru \r\nis a country that perceives regional integration as an \r\neffective way to improve the present and future of \r\nour security and development. We Peruvians have an \r\noverriding conviction that, on our own, we can move \r\nforward rapidly, but together we can do that better and \r\nreach farther.\r\nPeru is part of the Pacific Alliance, along with \r\nMexico, Chile and Colombia. Together we are moving \r\ntowards integration with a strategic projection towards \r\nthe Asia-Pacific region and the world. In that region, \r\nwhich is home to the most dynamic economies of the \r\ntwenty-first century, we are also part of the Asia-\r\nWe are deeply concerned to note that the \r\nenvironment is deteriorating, which is having an impact \r\non our security, in particular that of the most vulnerable. \r\nThis is happening even as we remain unable to agree on \r\nmeasures to ensure our sustainable development. \r\nThe development agenda must also pay particular \r\nattention to the empowerment of women and the \r\nprotection of vulnerable groups. Our Government \r\nattaches particular importance to the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples. We were the first in the world to \r\nlegislate and regulate the right to prior consultation on \r\nmeasures directly affecting such groups in accordance \r\nwith Convention No. 169 of the International Labour \r\nOrganization.\r\nWe are equally concerned about the rights of migrants \r\nand the opportunities for integrated development, to \r\nwhich they contribute, fostering inter-cultural dialogue \r\nand economic exchanges between their countries of \r\norigin and their host countries. In that vein, we have \r\npromoted the free movement of people and welcome the \r\ninitiative of the Government of Spain to promote visa-\r\nfree entry for Peruvian nationals into the Schengen \r\nArea .\r\nWe therefore welcome the commitments contained \r\nin the document “The future we want”, adopted at the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nheld last year (resolution 66/288, annex). The process \r\nproposed at that event to establish sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals should converge with the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, leading to the greater capacity \r\nof the Organization to contribute to solving urgent \r\nproblems and dealing with development challenges. \r\nWe urgently need to integrate the various separate \r\nefforts. The United Nations should have a single, \r\ncomprehensive development agenda. But to do so, we \r\nneed to change the equation and place the fight for \r\nequality and against inequality at the centre of our \r\nefforts. Let us not make growth an end in itself; rather, \r\nwe should turn it into a tool. That is why in Peru we \r\nbelieve that the right formula is “inclusion for growth.” \r\nThat is the direction Peru proposes for the post-2015 \r\nagenda.\r\nPeru has made a quantum leap in its economy. We \r\nare currently among the fastest-growing countries. \r\nResponsible management of our economy has helped to \r\ncreate 800,000 new jobs so far during my Administration \r\nand has also helped to reduce unemployment by \r\n7 per cent. We are gradually diversifying our economy. \r\n12/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nimportant dimension. It also has profoundly practical \r\nrepercussions for society at large. We cannot forget that \r\na State that does not serve the entire population breeds \r\nand exacerbates inequality. As long as such degrees of \r\ninequality exist – and I will never tire of saying this - \r\nany policy aimed at combating poverty will have only \r\nrelative effects.\r\nFor that reason, my Administration has worked not \r\nonly on economic growth but in all areas of growth. The \r\nhistory of my country has seen other periods of growth, \r\nbut they proved to be unsustainable and benefited very \r\nfew. Economic growth is a means and not an end; it \r\nis an indispensable tool, but it is not sufficient. Our \r\npeople, especially those who are most forgotten, cannot \r\nwait indefinitely for growth without the State actively \r\npromoting the extension of its benefits.\r\nIn addition, that will set in motion a virtuous circle \r\nin which progress for our most vulnerable countrymen \r\nand the development of a population free of extreme \r\npoverty, with health care and education for all, will \r\ncreate the conditions for even greater economic growth. \r\nThat is why we stress the new political concept of \r\nsimultaneous growth and redistribution. That is what \r\nI mean when I stress the necessity of “including so as \r\nto grow”.\r\nTwo years ago, less than two months into my term \r\nas President of Peru, I stood before the Assembly to \r\nemphasize my Government’s commitment to social \r\ninclusion. I said then that we were working to turn \r\nour economic growth into development and quality of \r\nlife for my countrymen. I also said that we intended to \r\nhone our democracy so that it could solve the problems \r\nand meet the needs of all. The country we want is a \r\nprosperous one where all the Peruvians, women and \r\nmen, without any distinction, can enjoy the benefits of \r\ngrowth in a dignified, safe and free manner. After two \r\nyears in office, I reaffirm what I said; our commitment \r\nremains the same.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Peru for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation Forum. We hosted the \r\nLeaders’ Meeting in 2008 and will host it again in 2016.\r\nWe are also a member of the Union of South \r\nAmerican Nations, having recently completed our \r\nterm as pro-tempore president. We participate in the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nwhich this year held its first summit with the Heads \r\nof State and Government of the European Union. \r\nWe maintain our hemispheric roots through the \r\nOrganization of American States, and at the subregional \r\nlevel, we are currently the pro-tempore president of the \r\nAndean Community. We consider all those forums to be \r\ncomplementary. We participate in them with a constant \r\ncall for integration, dialogue and consensus.\r\nPeru is a reliable partner committed to global \r\ncauses. Our commitment to the values  and principles \r\nof the General Assembly brings us to point out the \r\nneed for reform. That is necessary in order to make the \r\nUnited Nations system more legitimate, representative, \r\naccountable and effective through the strengthening of \r\nits principal organs, specialized agencies and various \r\norganizations in the areas of security, development \r\nand human rights. Peru shares the position held by a \r\nlarge number of Member States on the need to reform \r\nand expand the Security Council so as to reflect the \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century.\r\nOur aspirations also entail more transparency \r\nand accountability on the part of individual economic \r\nactors and greater justice in the distribution of wealth. \r\nWith those objectives in mind, in 2014 Peru will host \r\nthe thirty-fifth session of the Economic Commission \r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean and in 2016 the \r\nfourteenth United Nations Conference on Trade and \r\nDevelopment. We thereby hope to contribute so that the \r\nDoha Round can be resumed, in the scope of the World \r\nTrade Organization, with better prospects.\r\nIn many parts of our Latin America and in Peru, \r\nrepublican States were weak from the start, concentrated \r\nin the capital city. Their core problem has been therefore \r\nthat they have been unable to deal with the entire nation \r\nand have focused perhaps on one third of the country. \r\nIt was impossible to build citizenship, since in practice \r\nthere were different categories of Peruvians: those who \r\nreceived Government services and those who did not.\r\nOur efforts must be directed at the creation of a \r\ntwenty-first-century State, a State that serves all, \r\nnot just a few. While this includes an eminently \r\nethical component, its basis is not restricted to that \r\n13-48557 13/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nin peace, which has been repeatedly expressed in free \r\nelections with a high voter turnout.\r\nI thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nthe attention given to my country, which was again \r\nunderlined by his visit to Timor-Leste one year ago, \r\nwhich greatly honoured us.\r\nThe Timorese people now hold in their own hands \r\nfull responsibility for building their future. The country \r\nis facing the challenges with high hopes and optimism.\r\nOne such challenge is to focus national development \r\nefforts on diversifying the economy, reducing our \r\ndependency on oil and promoting inclusive development \r\nfor all Timorese people. Another is to consolidate our \r\nnational institutions, strengthening their technical \r\ncapacities and ensuring the participation of the younger \r\ngeneration in managing the country.\r\nThe older generations have incumbency and have \r\nthe duty to pass on to young people the wealth of values \r\ndeveloped during the liberation struggle, such as \r\nrespect for human dignity and dedication and service to \r\nthe country. Those values are as necessary to building \r\nan equitable society and a unified country today as they \r\nwere in the past to solidifying the unity of purpose of \r\nthe nation. The development of the country must not \r\nexclude any Timorese.\r\nThe relations between Timor-Leste and the United \r\nNations will continue to strengthen and will increasingly \r\nfocus on assistance in the area of human, social and \r\neconomic development efforts and the strengthening of \r\ninstitutions.\r\nThe international integration of the country \r\ncontinues to evolve at a good pace, guided by the goal of \r\ncontributing to a peaceful and stable international system \r\ncapable of promoting social and human opportunities \r\nfor all peoples. We are participating actively in the \r\ndevelopment of new forms of dialogue among fragile \r\nStates by establishing the Group of Seven Plus (g7+). \r\nThat group, over which Timor-Leste currently has the \r\nhonour of presiding, comprises 18 countries committed \r\nto promoting a new model of engagement between \r\nfragile States and other international stakeholders. The \r\nNew Deal for Engagement in Fragile States, promoted \r\nby the g7+, has been well received by the United Nations, \r\ndevelopment partners and international organizations. \r\nThe initiatives of the g7+ and the dynamic relationship \r\nof the group with development partners contributes \r\nAddress by Mr. Taur Matan Ruak, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Republic of \r\nTimor-Leste.\r\nMr. Taur Matan Ruak, President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Taur Matan Ruak, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ruak (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): Allow me to begin \r\nby conveying my vigorous condemnation of the \r\nrecent terrorist attacks in Kenya, Pakistan and Iraq, \r\nwhich killed scores of innocent people. On behalf of \r\nthe Government of Timor-Leste, I extend our deepest \r\ncondolences to the bereaved families in connection \r\nwith the senseless loss of their loved ones. Terrorism is \r\ncontrary to every civilized value we hold dear and for \r\nwhich we have fought. It must be condemned in all its \r\nmanifestations, regardless of its motives.\r\nThis is the first time that I am addressing this \r\nAssembly of representatives of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. I take this occasion to once \r\nagain thank the United Nations for its contribution to \r\nthe realization of the right of the people of Timor-Leste \r\nto decide on our own future. Timor-Leste’s experience \r\nshows the great value of the United Nations and the \r\nimportance of negotiated solutions, dialogue and \r\ndiplomacy to international disputes.\r\nThis is the first year without a United Nations \r\nmission in the country since the restoration of Timor-\r\nLeste’s independence 11 years ago. Our partnership \r\nwith the United Nations throughout the last decade \r\nachieved remarkable successes. The Timorese people’s \r\nyearning for stability and peace was decisive for the \r\nnew circumstances, which allowed the Security Council \r\nto remove Timor-Leste from its agenda.\r\nThe results obtained are shared jointly by the \r\ninternational community, through their solidarity and \r\npioneering efforts in the nation-building processes \r\nmade in Timor-Leste, and by the Timorese people, \r\nthrough their maturity and firm determination to live \r\n14/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nTurning our attention to international matters \r\nwhose urgency especially appeals to our conscience, \r\nmy country has witnessed with horror the growing \r\nviolence in Syria. We welcome the agreement that was \r\nreached to put Syria’s arsenal of chemical weapons \r\nunder United Nations control prior to its destruction. \r\nTimor-Leste rejects the use of chemical weapons in \r\nall circumstances. We are in favour of dialogue in the \r\nsearch for negotiated solutions, with the involvement \r\nof the United Nations. Only negotiation can help save \r\nlives and alleviate the high toll that the Syrian people \r\nare paying in human lives and social upheaval, which \r\nhas resulted in millions of internally displaced persons \r\nand refugees.\r\nIn Timor-Leste, we know only too well the losses \r\nand traumas of war. We are committed to preventing \r\nviolence in all its forms. Earlier this month, our Prime \r\nMinister, Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, joined the \r\nChampions initiative to end sexual violence in conflict, \r\nsupporting the corresponding action launched by the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn a world undergoing a rapid transition towards \r\nglobalization, the Security Council must upgrade \r\nits ability to effectively respond and must adjust its \r\ncomposition to better reflect the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. New Powers, including India, Indonesia \r\nand Brazil, among others, must be granted permanent \r\nmember status in the Security Council. At the same \r\ntime, my country is aware of the need for a better \r\nrepresentation of medium-sized and small countries \r\nwith relevant contributions to stability and peace. In that \r\nspirit, Timor-Leste supports New Zealand’s candidacy \r\nfor a non-permanent seat at the Security Council for \r\nthe 2015-2016 term. New Zealand has actively worked \r\nwith us for peace and security in Timor-Leste, and \r\nwe believe it will both enhance the representation of \r\nsmall States and be a constructive bridge-builder at the \r\nCouncil.\r\nOn 30 August, Timor-Leste celebrated the \r\nfourteenth anniversary of the referendum supervised \r\nby the United Nations that allowed the Timorese \r\npeople to realize their right to self-determination and \r\nindependence. In contrast, there are peoples who, after \r\ndecades, continue to patiently wait for the realization \r\nof that right. Such is the case of the Sahrawi people. A \r\nstable and lasting solution for Western Sahara cannot \r\nexist without the democratic expression of the will of \r\nits people.\r\nto the establishment of more innovative and effective \r\ninternational relations and cooperation.\r\nThe latest report on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) states that most countries will not \r\nachieve all the MDGs, and that is particularly true \r\nin the case of fragile and conflict-affected States. \r\nThe international community as a whole must draw \r\nlessons from that as we plan for the future. Many of \r\nthe world’s poorest have been left behind, including \r\naround 1.5 billion people across the globe who live in \r\nareas affected by fragility and conflict. That is why the \r\ng7+ countries came together with the following vital \r\nmessage: without peace there can be no development \r\nand without development there can be no peace. And \r\nto add a further dimension to that, there can be neither \r\npeace nor development without inclusive and responsive \r\nState institutions that are capable of being responsive \r\nand attending to people’s needs.\r\nAt the regional level, we have established friendly \r\nrelations with neighbouring countries in South-East \r\nAsia and the Pacific, in particular with Australia \r\nand Indonesia, our closest neighbours, with whom \r\nwe maintain intense cooperation. The process of \r\nreconciliation between Timor-Leste and Indonesia \r\nand the excellent relations that our two countries have \r\ndeveloped represent a model whose lessons are useful \r\nand relevant beyond our borders and outside our region.\r\nTimor-Leste has submitted its application for \r\nmembership in the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations. We have developed friendly relations with \r\nall member States of that organization, which makes \r\nrelevant contributions to stability in our region. Our \r\ncountry is a member of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\nand a special observer at the Pacific Islands Forum. We \r\nplay an active role in and are committed to multilateral \r\nprocesses, which are important for regional stability \r\nand security.\r\nThe unanimous election of Timor-Leste to chair \r\nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \r\nPacific by the countries members of that United Nations \r\nbody reflects my country’s harmonious international \r\nintegration. As a member of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, we will have the \r\nhonour of chairing that organization in the period 2014-\r\n2016. Timor-Leste believes in making its voice directly \r\nheard in every multilateral forum of relevance to our \r\nnational interest and will submit an application for \r\nmembership in the Commonwealth of Nations.\r\n13-48557 15/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\npromote improving food security and the fight against \r\nmalnutrition, it will not be possible to make rapid \r\nand sure progress towards attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. The new objectives are defined in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, due to be launched \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\r\nTimor-Leste is following, with great interest, \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda process and was \r\nhonoured by the invitation to Dr. Emilia Pires, our \r\nMinister of Finance, to participate in the High-level \r\nPanel that drafted a proposal for the agenda, following a \r\nrequest by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nThe past experience of the Timorese people and the \r\ncountry’s liberation struggle, in which we were engaged \r\nfor 24 years, have demonstrated that only tolerance, \r\ndialogue and mutual respect, which the Timorese \r\nresistance consistently showed and I have consistently \r\nsupported — in short, veneration for the dignity of \r\npeople — will allow us to reach durable solutions to \r\ndisputes between countries.\r\nIn a world where challenges are rapidly becoming \r\nglobalized, requiring concerted and effective responses, \r\nthe actions of the United Nations are more than ever \r\nessential for the stability of international relations. \r\nTimor-Leste will continue to show its commitment \r\nto the United Nations, so that the Organization may \r\nbetter respond to the desires of Member States and the \r\nchallenges they face, and to unhesitatingly assert the \r\nvalues of peace and mutual respect. I wish the Assembly \r\nthe best of luck in its work. \r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Democratic Republic \r\nof Timor-Leste for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taur Matan Ruak, President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Macky Sall, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Senegal. \r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nWe commend the decision of the leaders of \r\nthe State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority to \r\nresume direct talks under the auspices of the United \r\nStates Government. Timor-Leste supports the right \r\nof the peoples of Palestine and Israel to live side by \r\nside in peace, with dignity and in safety. We hope that \r\nthe peace talks already initiated may at last lead to a \r\nsolution with two sovereign States coexisting in an \r\nenvironment of mutual respect and rejecting extremism \r\nand violence. We condemn the building of settlements \r\nin the occupied territories and all unilateral initiatives \r\ncontrary to resolutions of the United Nations.\r\nWe believe in dialogue, openness and inclusion as \r\na means of strengthening confidence in international \r\nrelations. Therefore, we call for an end to the embargo \r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba, an embargo that does not \r\ntake into account the reality of today, of the country or \r\nof the Cuban people. We also call on President Barack \r\nObama to act in accordance with his powers and release \r\nthe four Cuban citizens, from an initial group of five, \r\nwho have been incarcerated for over a decade in North \r\nAmerican prisons.\r\nAllow me now to address the situation in Guinea-\r\nBissau, a sister nation to Timor-Leste in the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries currently \r\nexperiencing an easing of political and social tensions, \r\nwhich we hope will lead to the re-establishment of \r\ninstitutional normalcy and democracy. We welcome the \r\nefforts of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding \r\nOffice in Guinea-Bissau, which were led by my \r\npredecessor as Head of State of Timor-Leste, Mr. José \r\nManuel Ramos-Horta. His initiatives have helped to \r\nenhance the prestige of the United Nations among the \r\npeople of Guinea-Bissau and to create an environment \r\nof greater trust and dialogue in the country. The \r\nproblems of Guinea-Bissau can be solved. Timor-\r\nLeste will continue to support the patient efforts of the \r\nGuinean people and the international community aimed \r\nat intensifying dialogue and reconciliation among the \r\npeople of Guinea-Bissau and promoting a democratic \r\nsolution within an appropriate time frame. \r\nAmong the critical global challenges facing \r\nhumankind today, I want to highlight the severity of \r\nmalnutrition, which affects hundreds of millions of \r\npeople worldwide. The dual challenges of improving \r\nfood security and reducing malnutrition on a \r\nglobal scale require a renewed boost from all of us, \r\nincluding development partner countries. Without \r\nnew coordinated initiatives and greater investment to \r\n16/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nthe need for a concerted campaign against tax evasion \r\nand other fraudulent practices affecting our economies. \r\nWe must now push ahead and launch the mechanisms \r\nwe have agreed on for improving transparency in \r\ninternational transactions, including the mining \r\nindustry. This is the best way to support Africa’s efforts \r\nto mobilize domestic resources in order to finance its \r\ndevelopment.\r\nSimilarly, Senegal calls for the reform of \r\ninternational economic and financial governance, \r\nnotably the terms for accessing credit and obtaining \r\nfinancing for economic and social development \r\nprojects. Let us not pave the road to the future with \r\nthe instruments of the past. While plummeting official \r\ndevelopment assistance no longer meets Africa’s needs, \r\nthe trend towards progress should lead us to explore \r\nother innovative financing mechanisms available to \r\nour countries. Africa is no longer a zone of turmoil \r\nand humanitarian emergencies. Africa has become an \r\nemerging centre of opportunities and investments for \r\ninnovative and mutually beneficial partnerships.\r\nMr. Maelanga (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe world has changed; Africa has also changed. \r\nLet us therefore change our paradigms and visions; let \r\nus change the way we look at the continent. \r\nChange is also needed for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. The Council’s legitimacy is not derived \r\nonly from its status as the guarantor of the collective \r\nsecurity system; it is also and especially derived from \r\nthe representativeness that justifies its action in the \r\nname of and on behalf of all Member States.\r\nThis time last year, Mali was doubly affected by \r\na coup and a terrorist attack reminiscent of a bygone \r\nage. They were a source of great concern for us. \r\nSenegal, which remains active within United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \r\nin Mali, welcomes the restoration of the territorial \r\nintegrity and constitutional legality of Mali. We \r\ncongratulate the people of Mali and their political \r\nleaders for that happy outcome. We strongly support \r\nthe national reconciliation efforts being made by the \r\nGovernment in the spirit of the Ouagadougou Political \r\nAgreement.\r\nToday, while the armed groups have been \r\ndefeated, the terrorist threat to the Sahel has not yet \r\nbeen definitively ended. It is only through ongoing, \r\ncoordinated and sufficiently deterrent action that we \r\nExcellency Mr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic \r\nof Senegal, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sall (spoke in French): On behalf of the \r\nSenegalese delegation, I would like to wish you, Sir, all \r\nthe best as President at the sixty-eighth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. \r\nBy focusing its debate on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, the General Assembly reminds us \r\nthat there is not much time left before attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is finally \r\nevaluated. Despite progress after more than a decade \r\nof implementing the MDGs, the magnitude of the \r\nchallenges is still overwhelming. In terms of access to \r\nfood, housing, education and healthcare, the daily lives of \r\nnearly one billion people have barely improved. Women \r\ncontinue to die in childbirth. Inequalities persist within \r\nand between countries. The economic crisis continues \r\nand environmental degradation is worsening. We need \r\nto take concrete and resolute actions to transform our \r\ncollective ambitions into reality. \r\nIn the quest for sustainable development, a \r\nconference on climate change in 2015 in Paris will \r\nprovides us with another opportunity to pull ourselves \r\ntogether, by reversing the negative effects of climate \r\nchange on Earth, our common habitat.\r\nAddressing the challenges of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and building the future we want, in \r\nthe spirit of the Rio+20 Conference, require a more \r\nsustained effort than the fight against poverty. \r\nWe should invest more in education, as the Global \r\nPartnership for Education expects of us. We need to \r\nmodernize agriculture, make electricity accessible to \r\neverybody and develop infrastructure to foster trade and \r\ninvestment. These are the pillars that underpin growth \r\nand prosperity. It is precisely this vision that the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) seeks \r\nto promote through its Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa (PIDA).\r\nAs part of that programme, 51 priority projects \r\nhave been identified and established throughout the \r\ncontinent. Overall, they will cost $68 billion between \r\n2012 and 2020. As Chairperson of NEPAD’s Orientation \r\nCommittee, I am pleased with the consensus that our \r\npartners have built around PIDA, namely, the Group of \r\nTwenty and the Group of Eight (G-8) and with Brazil, \r\nRussia, India and China.\r\nI also welcome the very strong signal which the \r\nG-8, meeting in June in Lough Erne, sent concerning \r\n13-48557 17/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Senegal for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): \r\nWhen the nations of the world come together in the \r\nGeneral Assembly to consider the major issues facing \r\nhumankind, it is an honour and a privilege to take the \r\nf loor and to express the viewpoint of one’s country. \r\nAnimated by those twin sentiments, on behalf of the \r\nCongolese people I address the Assembly and through \r\nit the community of nations as a whole.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express my most sincere \r\ncongratulations to Mr. John Ashe on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at the sixty-eighth \r\nsession. I also congratulate the members of his Bureau. \r\nI further wish to hail his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, \r\nfor the outststanding way in which he fulfilled his term \r\nas President. I would also like to pay well-deserved \r\ntribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for all his \r\ninitiatives for peace and security throughout the world \r\nand for his personal involvement in seeking ways \r\nand means to bring peace and stability to the eastern \r\npart of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the \r\nentire Great Lakes region. His efforts are all the more \r\ncommendable given the fact that the enemies of peace \r\nare always on the lookout, ready to strike anyone, \r\nanytime and anywhere, as we have unfortunately been \r\nrecently reminded by the terrorist attack that brought \r\nsuch tragedy to the Republic of Kenya. On behalf of \r\nthe Congolese Government and people and on my own \r\nwill be able to address the emerging security challenges \r\non the African continent. It is urgent to make operational \r\nthe African rapid response force, proposed at the last \r\nAfrican Union summit.\r\nIn Guinea-Bissau, Senegal is supporting the \r\nGovernment’s efforts to successfully carry out the \r\nelectoral process. We urge our partner countries and \r\ninstitutions to pursue their support for the definitive \r\nresolution of the Guinea-Bissau crisis through the \r\ncountry’s economic recovery, the crucial reform of \r\nthe defence and security sector, and the fight against \r\nillicit drug trafficking. We hope that similar attention \r\nwill be paid to the Central African Republic and to the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo in the legitimate \r\naspiration to peace, stability and the preservation \r\nof territorial integrity. Throughout Africa, we are \r\ncommitted to upholding respect for the African Union \r\nprinciples against anti-constitutional changes of \r\nGovernment, regardless of the process used.\r\nIn regard to the Middle East, Senegal expresses its \r\ndeep concern over the untold suffering of the Syrian \r\npopulation. We urge the Syrian Government to exercise \r\nrestraint and to comply with the Chemical Weapons \r\nConvention in the control and destruction of its arsenal \r\nof chemical weapons.\r\nIn its capacity as Chairman of the Committee on \r\nthe Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, Senegal is following the resumption of the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace negotiations. It is a courageous \r\nand responsible act because it translates the vision of \r\ntwo States, Israel and Palestine, living within secure \r\nand internationally recognized borders. We therefore \r\ncall for a halt to acts likely to affect that perspective, \r\nnotably the ongoing establishment of settlements on \r\nPalestinian land by the Israeli Government.\r\nOn 24 September, Senegal joined other countries \r\nin launching the international campaign for the fight \r\nagainst sexual violence in armed conflict. Sexual \r\nviolence in conflict is an act of unbearable cruelty for \r\nthe victims and their families. It is a war crime and \r\na serious violation of human dignity and universal \r\nconscience. In the name of our common humanity, it \r\nis time to act to prevent and stop such horrors. It is \r\ntime to act so that victims will no longer feel alone in \r\ntheir suffering, which destroys the very foundations of \r\nsociety. It is time to act so that the perpetrators and \r\ntheir accomplices in those crimes are tracked down \r\neverywhere, prosecuted and punished in a manner \r\ncommensurate with the atrocities of their crimes.\r\n18/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\npositive change, based on the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities. In that respect, it is \r\nimportant to utilize the contribution of women, youth \r\nand civil society in both the design and the execution \r\nof the agenda. We should also draw lessons from the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nWith regard to climate change as an important issue \r\nto resolve in the post-2015 period, allow me to recall \r\nthat, under the final document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n66/288), States pledged to abandon unsustainable long-\r\nterm patterns of consumption and adopt sustainable \r\nways of managing natural resources as the basis for \r\neconomic and social development and the very future \r\nof humankind. Climate change is a threat to humankind \r\nand fundamental human rights, particularly for \r\nvulnerable populations and especially those from the \r\nAfrican continent and island countries. Seeking to limit \r\nits impact is, for each of our countries, a responsibility \r\nthat we must shoulder as a duty towards our people, a \r\nservice to the human race and an act of international \r\nsolidarity.\r\nRecognizing that fact, the Democratic Republic \r\nof Congo, a country of exceptional biodiversity, has \r\nalways sought to manage its natural resources with a \r\nview to the future. The management policy for of our \r\nforest ecosystems is aimed at that. The Grand Inga \r\nproject has also been designed along those lines. We \r\nshould emphasize, in fact, that that project should \r\neventually enable us to produce enough electricity to \r\nmeet the energy needs of nearly half of Africa. It will \r\nalso be clean and renewable energy, consistent with the \r\nrequirements of sustainable development.\r\nToday we must begin to set the stage for the post-\r\n2015 period. In that context, I express the hope that \r\nproposals will be made during this session to translate \r\ninto reality our common desire to promote the economic, \r\nsocial and environmental dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Such proposals should cover our local, \r\nnational and regional development programmes. They \r\nshould also encourage bold international cooperation \r\nand reflect the will of each of our States to contribute \r\nto international peace and security.\r\nWithout peace, no progress is possible. Without \r\nthe minimum conditions for the safety of persons and \r\nproperty, all development is hypothetical. That is all the \r\nmore unacceptable since a breach of the peace is the \r\nresult of aggression. That is the sad recent history of \r\nmy country.\r\nbehalf, I condemn that despicable act. We express our \r\ncondolences and solidarity with the brotherly people \r\nand leaders of Kenya.\r\nWe welcome the President’s choice of theme for this \r\ngeneral debate, namely, “The post-2015 development \r\nagenda: setting the stage”. He mentioned the equally \r\nrelevant need to draw lessons from the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, consider new and \r\nemerging development challenges, create measurable \r\nindicators, establish new types of partnership and \r\nbetter integrate the economic, social and environmental \r\naspects of sustainable development. The importance of \r\nthe theme chosen and the relevance of the indicators \r\nthat accompany it are undeniable. Our thinking must \r\nbe even more rigorous, as we witness several troubling \r\nelements in the international environment.\r\nWith respect to organizing for the post-2015 \r\nperiod, the international community is increasingly \r\nwitnessing non-compliance on the part of certain \r\nMembers with the basic principles of international \r\nrelations, persistent selfishness on the part of States and \r\nconvulsions in the global economy. The consequences \r\nare manifold. They range from threats to peace to \r\ndeadly conflicts and from globalization driven mainly \r\nby the unbridled pursuit of profit to the aggravation \r\nof poverty. That comes in addition to the food crisis, \r\nfamines, diseases — including endemic diseases that \r\nhad once disappeared and are now reappearing — and \r\nenvironmental destruction, which is the main cause of \r\nclimate change and its deplorable effects.\r\nTo remedy the situation, the General Assembly \r\nhas established several bodies, and I welcome their \r\ncreation: the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing \r\nand the high-level political forum to promote the \r\nimplementation of recommendations and decisions on \r\nsustainable development. My hope is that that process \r\nwill be consistent with the ongoing transformation \r\nof the Economic and Social Council and, beyond \r\nthat, of the entire United Nations system, in order to \r\nbetter integrate the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, namely, the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental dimensions, in the new post-2015 \r\nagenda.\r\nThe new programme that we are called upon to \r\ncreate must be universal, ambitious and able to meet the \r\nhuge challenges facing humankind. It must bring about \r\n13-48557 19/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nthe United Nations. It is clear that denouncing violations \r\nof those principles is a good thing, but punishing those \r\nwho violate the principles is preferable by far, especially \r\nwhen those violations are ongoing and recurrent.\r\nI cannot conclude my remarks without expressing \r\nmy thanks to the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, the International Conference on the Great \r\nLakes Region, the African Union and the European \r\nUnion for their essential role in maintaining peace in \r\nour region. I also thank the United Nations, in particular \r\nthe members of the Security Council, and all of those \r\nStates that have, for many years, remained at our side \r\nin order to ensure peace in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. We are all the more thankful to them, as \r\nthey have participated in one of the breakthroughs of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda aimed at ensuring a \r\nbetter world for all.\r\nWe must be convinced that beyond our differences \r\nlies a common future. Our diversity must be seen as \r\nthe essential source of wealth that it is. It is high time \r\nthat we, the international community, find the ways \r\nand means to enable millions of people to not simply \r\nlive, but to live a life of dignity in a world where peace, \r\nsecurity and justice are a reality for all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President \r\nof the Transition of the Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Transition of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the \r\nTransition of the Republic of Madagascar, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, \r\nPresident of the Transition of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajoelina (spoke in French): It is often \r\nsaid that things always come in threes. Indeed, this is \r\nIt is also important to remember other parallel \r\ntruths that are often overlooked or hidden. Because we \r\nacted in solidarity by welcoming Rwandan refugees to \r\nour territory, the Congolese population in the eastern \r\npart of the country has been deprived of peace — a \r\nfundamental right of all persons — and they continue \r\nto count their dead. The most recent episode of the \r\nunending tragedy occurred when bombs crushed the \r\nwomen and children of Goma last July. It was truly a \r\ntragedy unequalled in history and which cannot leave \r\nany heart untouched. It is time to ask ourselves what will \r\nremain of international humanitarian law if welcoming \r\nrefugees in distress, which is a humanitarian act par \r\nexcellence, becomes sufficient reason to justify the \r\neruption of war. \r\nThe recent bombing of Goma was all the \r\nmore reprehensible as it was perpetrated while the \r\nGovernment of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo was in the process of implementing the Peace, \r\nSecurity and Cooperation Framework of Addis Ababa, \r\nincluding talks with the armed group responsible for \r\nthe bombings. Nevertheless, I wish to reaffirm my \r\ncountry’s determination to comply with all of the \r\ncommitments contained in the Framework agreement. \r\nFrom that perspective, my Government has already \r\nundertaken the following definitive actions: the \r\nestablishment of the National Follow-up Mechanism to \r\nimplement the commitments of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo; the acceleration of security sector \r\nreform, especially the army, police and justice sectors; \r\nfurther progress in decentralization, by adopting the \r\nnecessary implementation laws; the reform of public \r\nfinance management; and the restructuring of the \r\nIndependent National Election Commission. This last \r\nwas immediately implemented in order to prioritize the \r\norganization of local, municipal, provincial, senatorial \r\nand provincial governor elections. A national dialogue \r\nhas been organized, starting on 7 September, with the \r\ngoal of seeking national cohesion to better respond to \r\nall of the challenges facing the country.\r\nBeyond those efforts on the part of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the dawn of sustainable peace \r\nin the region depends on two main conditions — ending \r\nimpunity in all its aspects, and the diligent execution \r\nof their commitments by the other signatories of the \r\nFramework agreement. Therefore, my country again \r\nurgently appeals to the Organization to deal with all \r\nMember States with equal rigour and to require that \r\neach one strictly respect the principles of the Charter of \r\n20/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nMadagascar is finding it difficult to attain all the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, despite the efforts \r\neveryone has made. Given that situation, I have to \r\nwonder what sort of contribution we, the leaders of our \r\nnations, can make individually to that collective effort, \r\nwith a view to finding ways of improving the daily lives \r\nof those who have put their trust in us and placed their \r\ndestiny in our hands.\r\nIn his statement yesterday (see A/68/PV.5), \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon stressed the fact that, \r\nin streets and squares across the world, people are \r\npressing those in power. They want world leaders to \r\nlisten. They want to know that we are doing everything \r\nwe can to secure a life of dignity for all. The popular \r\nunrest in the context of the Arab Spring and the \r\nmovements of the outraged exemplify this observation \r\nand reflect a legitimate aspiration. I fully support the \r\nSecretary-General’s remarks and call upon all of us to \r\nensure that we clearly understand the demands of the \r\ndemonstrators. \r\nMadagascar would also have wished to benefit \r\nfrom such understanding when the Malagasy people \r\nrose up against an unpopular regime to demand a better \r\nlife through the establishment of genuine change. But \r\nthat was not the case. On the contrary, Madagascar \r\nencountered misunderstanding and the inflexibility of \r\nan international community operating at various speeds, \r\nnot to mention the application of dogmatic texts, even \r\nthough popular uprisings elsewhere, in very similar \r\ncircumstances, had been viewed sympathetically and \r\nwith concern.\r\nEfforts must therefore now be made to end the \r\nunequal treatment of countries in crisis. We must \r\nbecome aware of popular aspirations and realities on \r\nthe ground so as not to take the wrong decision. If it \r\nis valid elsewhere, surely it is also valid in the case of \r\nMadagascar? \r\nAll the conditions were in place in Madagascar. \r\nThe danger of a social explosion and a fratricidal \r\nconflict was omnipresent, but fortunately — unlike \r\nsome countries that continue to experience unrest and \r\neven armed violence, and despite all the economic \r\nand social restrictions and the absence of support and \r\nassistance from the international community from \r\nwhich Madagascar has suffered in recent years — the \r\npeople of Madagascar did not fall into the trap of internal \r\nconflict, which some would have taken advantage of.\r\nthe third time that I have had the privilege to address \r\nthe Assembly as President of the Transition of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar. Here we are again, convening \r\nas we do every year for the General Assembly. All \r\nthe leaders of the planet meet regularly to debate, \r\nexchange views and share their experiences within the \r\nframework of a process of consultations that belongs \r\nto a long collective march towards peace, security and \r\nsustainable planetary development. But each year, new, \r\never more violent and more lethal conflicts are waged, \r\nrequiring that we respond with equal intensity. Shall \r\nwe limit ourselves to simply speaking about conflict \r\nresolution, or shall we to challenge ourselves, analyse \r\nthe underlying causes and take the necessary measures \r\nto preserve stability in the world? \r\nAs I add my voice to those who have spoken before \r\nme, I warmly congratulate the President on the votes \r\nthat he won in support of his candidacy. Madagascar \r\nwill endeavour to provide him its sincere support and \r\ncooperation.\r\nRegrettably, over recent decades, when we speak \r\nof Africa, we generally see States that are exposed \r\nto permanent violence and the progressive loss of \r\ndemocracy, States where wars, conflicts and crises \r\ncontinually break out and there is more division than \r\nconsensus. According to Ambassador Jeremić, who \r\npresided at the sixty-seventh session of the General \r\nAssembly, humankind is facing an existential crisis, \r\nwith symptoms such as economic instability, social \r\ninequalities and environmental degradation. \r\nFor my part, I would add that humankind may be \r\nlosing its forward momentum but that it is not giving \r\nup. Yes, the news delivered by the media every day is \r\nextremely worrying throughout the world. Whether the \r\ncountry is developed, emerging or poor, no segment of \r\nsociety escapes deterioration of various kinds, including \r\npoor employment conditions, unemployment, declining \r\npurchasing power, the total absence of any income at \r\nall, lack of access to basic necessities in food, clothing, \r\nhealth care and education, and, in addition, poverty, \r\ndeprivation and indigence. Those are all factors that \r\nare the nurturing ground for intolerance, confrontation \r\nand conflict, thereby helping to give rise to global \r\ninsecurity. I refer here particularly to recent events in \r\nKenya, Iraq, Pakistan and Syria, to name just a few. We \r\nfully share in the pain and sorrow of the families of the \r\nvictims. \r\nSome 800 days from the deadline of 2015, like \r\nmost African States and many developing countries, \r\n13-48557 21/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nIn my case, I did everything I could to overcome \r\nthe political crisis in Madagascar and maintain national \r\nunity and the best interests of the Malagasy people. \r\nI also decided that I will not be a candidate in the \r\nupcoming presidential elections. It is on that note, and \r\nwith the well-known words of American theologian \r\nand writer James Freeman Clarke, that I would like to \r\nconclude: “A politician thinks of the next election. A \r\nstatesman, of the next generation.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Transition \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Andry Nirina Rajoelina, President of the \r\nTransition of the Republic of Madagascar, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Blaise Compaoré, President of \r\nBurkina Faso\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Burkina Faso.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Blaise Compaoré, President \r\nof Burkina Faso, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Campaoré (spoke in French): \r\nSociopolitical crises, armed conflicts, the degradation \r\nof ecosystems, pandemics like HIV/AIDS, religious \r\nextremism, terrorism, cross-border crime and \r\ndevelopment problems are today the vital questions that \r\ncall upon the conscience of individuals, summoning \r\ntheir responsibility for building the present and the \r\nfuture. I am convinced of the need to enhance our \r\nspirit of sharing and solidarity in order to meet the \r\nchallenges of promoting peace, stability and security \r\nand to provide humankind with all the tools needed for \r\nbetter mastery of its evolution.\r\nBefore continuing, I would like to congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. In addition, I would \r\nlike to express our recognition for the remarkable way \r\nin which his predecessor, Mr. Vuk Jeremić, presided \r\nover the work of the sixty-seventh session. Allow \r\nme also to repeat to the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nIt is with great national pride that I announce \r\nfrom this rostrum that Madagascar was able to avoid \r\ncivil war. That required considerable sacrifice, self-\r\ndenial and humility, but we came through thanks \r\nto our patriotism. I reiterate the fact that despite our \r\ndisagreements and our different points of view, we have \r\nreached a settlement of our conflict using all available \r\nnegotiation methods. I would like to solemnly thank the \r\nMalagasy people, who are a peaceful people and aspire \r\nto peace and whose courage and patience have been \r\nunmatched in the peaceful settlement of our political \r\ncrisis. \r\nThe Malagasy people deserve a better future. \r\nCitizens will be able to freely express their choices \r\non their future leader through the ballot box at the \r\nupcoming presidential elections, scheduled to take \r\nplace on 25 October this year, for which the electoral \r\ncampaign began yesterday.\r\nMadagascar is now starting a new phase in its \r\nhistory. I would like to warmly thank all those who, \r\nthroughout the process of Madagascar’s emergence \r\nfrom its crisis, supported and assisted us during the \r\ntransition period, in particular, the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC), the various \r\npresidents of the SADC Troika, the African Union, the \r\nEuropean Union, the United Nations, the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation, the International Organization \r\nof la Francophonie, and all friendly countries without \r\nexception, without forgetting those who have already \r\ndemonstrated their willingness to provide international \r\nobservers for the elections. At the same time, I would \r\nlike to renew my appeal to the entire General Assembly \r\nto join the ranks of our partners.\r\nWe are at a crossroads. The people expect specific \r\nand tangible results. The question is, do we have the \r\ncourage and the wisdom to sacrifice ourselves for the \r\nwell-being of our people and to avoid conflict and civil \r\nwar, so that innocent people do not lose their lives, so \r\nthat those who are in power no longer use weapons and \r\nso that no one resorts to violence? \r\nAs a leader, I realize that the exercise of power \r\nrequires an awareness of our humanity and our \r\nfallibility. That is the message that Madagascar would \r\nlike convey as its contribution to this general debate \r\ntoday. The world is changing very quickly, a new \r\ngeneration is rising to replace the old one, and leaders \r\nhave the duty to meet the expectations of our people \r\nand to find a solution to ensure their well-being.\r\n22/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nBeyond the resolution of sociopolitical and military \r\ncrises in West Africa, Burkina Faso strongly supports \r\nthe initiatives of the international community that \r\nseek to restore lasting stability in the Central African \r\nRepublic, the Democratic People’s Republic of the \r\nCongo, the Great Lakes region, Somalia and the Sudan.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my country \r\nsupports the search for a political solution acceptable \r\nto all parties and reaffirms its support to the Moroccan \r\ninitiative for an autonomous status for the Saharan \r\nregion as a credible and realistic alternative in resolving \r\nthat dispute.\r\nBeyond the African continent, the situation in the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic urgently requires an immediate \r\nend to the hostilities and a search for political \r\nsolutions to the crisis. Therefore we encourage the \r\nimplementation of the American-Russian agreement of \r\n14 September aimed at control and dismantlement of \r\nchemical weapons stockpiles. \r\nWith regard to the situation in the Middle East, \r\nwe welcome the relaunching of direct negotiations \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine and strongly encourage \r\nthe different parties to work towards a peaceful solution \r\nto the conflict in order to reach a fair and equitable \r\nsolution based on the recognition of a Palestinian State \r\nliving in perfect harmony with Israel.\r\nThe climate of dialogue and détente that \r\ncharacterizes relations between the Republic of China \r\non Taiwan and the People’s Republic of China should \r\nbe welcomed and encouraged. In that spirit, we must \r\nwelcome the Republic of China on Taiwan in the \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies, particularly the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nWe also welcome Taiwan’s incalculable contribution \r\nin support of the achievement by developing countries \r\nsuch as Burkina Faso of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.\r\nPeace in Africa requires pertinant socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment programmes to generate effective \r\nresponses to the uncertainties created by the \r\ninternational economic situation and to strengthen \r\ntrust between the people and the leaders. A landlocked \r\ncountry of the Sahel without great natural resources, \r\nBurkina Faso is committed to implementing strong \r\npolicies in the context of its Strategy of Accelerated \r\nGrowth and Sustainable Development, with a view to \r\nKi-moon, the expression of the esteem and recognition \r\nof the Government of Burkina Faso for his availability \r\nand staunch commitment to peace and development. \r\nThe current session is taking place in an \r\ninternational context characterized by relentless \r\neconomic difficulties and growing threats to peace \r\nand security on a global scale. I take this opportunity \r\nto express to the people of Kenya the compassion and \r\nsolidarity of the people of Burkina Faso following \r\nthe terrorist attacks that were recently perpetrated in \r\nNairobi.\r\nThe West African subregion continues to be marked \r\nby the stigma of multidimensional crises that have \r\ntaken place over the past two decades. Our subregion, \r\nand particularly the Sahelo-Saharan zone, has became a \r\nhideout for drug traffickers and terrorists whose desire \r\nto destabilize the region represents a real threat to the \r\npeace and security of our States.\r\nI would like to welcome the gradual improvement of \r\nthe situation in Mali since the deployment of the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in Mali and the holding of presidential elections, \r\nwhich supports the re-established constitutional order. \r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate my \r\nthanks to all those players who have helped to resolve \r\nthe crisis in Mali. To the Malian authorities and people, \r\nI express my warmest congratulations on the success \r\nof the recent presidential elections. The implementation \r\nof the United Nations integrated strategy for the Sahel \r\nwill contribute, I am convinced, to enhancing stability \r\nin that country and in the entire Sahelo-Saharan region. \r\nBurkina Faso is determined to play a role alongside the \r\ninternational community to achieve the objectives of \r\nthat strategy.\r\nDialogue is the favoured way to ensure \r\nunderstanding among and within peoples. Furthermore, \r\nthe Government of Burkina Faso supports strengthening \r\nsocial cohesion, broadening spaces for freedom and \r\ndialogue, and seeking together solutions to conflicts. It \r\nis in that spirit that my country has been participating \r\nfor two decades in peacekeeping operations conducted \r\nby the United Nations, the African Union and the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States, with \r\ncontingents of about 2,000 men and women who are \r\ndeployed in various theatres of operation. I pay tribute \r\nto the efforts of all those who work tirelessly to build a \r\nworld of peace and freedom. \r\n13-48557 23/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Dessalegn (Ethiopia): It is with great pleasure \r\nthat I congratulate the President on his election to his \r\nhigh office to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-eighth session, which is being held under the \r\ntheme: “The post-2015 development agenda: setting the \r\nstage”. I wish to assure the President of the full support \r\nand cooperation of my delegation in the successful \r\ndischarge of his heavy responsibilities. I would also \r\nlike to commend his predecessor for the able leadership \r\nhe demonstrated during the previous session.\r\nLet me begin by condemning the terrorist attacks in \r\nKenya that claimed the lives of innocent civilians and \r\nleft many more injured. I wish to express my heartfelt \r\ncondolences to the people and Government of Kenya, \r\nas well as to the families of the victims of that callous \r\nattack. That incident once again demonstrates the need \r\nfor us to renew our commitment to fight terrorism and \r\nextremism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nI am addressing the Assembly today not only on \r\nbehalf of my country but also as the representative of \r\nthe African Union (AU), which Ethiopia has the honour \r\nof chairing this year. It is a welcome coincidence that \r\nEthiopia, which played host to the founding Conference \r\nof the Organization of African Unity (OAU), 50 years \r\nago, has assumed the rotating chairpersonship of \r\nthat premier continental organization at a time when \r\nits golden jubilee is being celebrated. We were very \r\npleased to host the Special Summit of African Heads \r\nof State and Government, which marked the OAU/\r\nAU jubilee on 25 May, and I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to all \r\nthose who sent delegations to Addis Ababa to take part \r\nin the celebration and conveyed messages of support \r\nand solidarity to the African Union. Since the fiftieth \r\nanniversary will be a year-long event, we would like \r\nto continue to mark the historic milestone during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly by reflecting on the \r\nrelations between the United Nations and the then \r\nOrganization of African Union and today’s African \r\nUnion over the past half-century.\r\nWhen the Charter of the United Nations was \r\nsigned in 1945, much of Africa was under the yoke \r\nof colonialism. Since then, our continent has been \r\nliberated from the remnants of colonialism and other \r\nforms of subjugation. Today, it is gratifying to note \r\npromoting development and to significantly improving \r\nin the quality of life of the people of Burkina Faso. \r\nAs we approach the deadline for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, the theme of the \r\ncurrent session, “The post-2015 development agenda: \r\nsetting the stage”, raises in a pertinant way the issue of \r\nthe dialectical relationship between development, peace \r\nand security. It therefore offers us an opportunity to \r\nfocus our thinking on a new vision in order to achieve \r\ncomprehensive progress, based on strong international \r\nsolidarity, towards sustainable development. That \r\nis why it is important that we redouble our efforts \r\nto regulate environmental issues on the basis of \r\nthe outcome of the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex), \r\nheld in 2012 in Rio de Janeiro.\r\nPeace and stability appear as still-distant goals, \r\ngiven the number of centres of conflict throughout \r\nthe world. That situation demands that we further \r\nstrengthen multilateralism, rigorously apply the \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of our Organization, \r\nstrengthen the instruments for promoting those ideals \r\nand carry out the reform of United Nations bodies, in \r\nparticular the Security Council. It is my hope that the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s work at this session will contribute \r\nto achieving those noble objectives for a more fulfilled \r\nand united humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Burkina \r\nFaso for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Blaise Compaoré, President of Burkina Faso, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic  \r\nof Ethiopia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, \r\n24/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\ndo indeed harmonize our efforts to maintain — in fact, \r\nspeed up — the rapid economic growth that Africa has \r\nbeen registering for the last decade or so. We have every \r\nreason to be optimistic that an African renaissance is \r\naround the corner. \r\nThat positive development is unquestionably \r\nencouraging, but we recognize that we can achieve our \r\naspirations for a peaceful, prosperous and integrated \r\nAfrica only by bringing about structural transformation. \r\nThat is why we are capitalizing on the golden jubilee \r\ncelebration to chart a transformation agenda for Africa \r\nto be implemented over the next 50 years. At our \r\nmost recent session, in May, we also adopted our AU \r\nCommission’s strategic plan for the period 2014-2017, \r\nwhose main objective is to lay a solid foundation for the \r\nrealization of our vision in the short and medium term.\r\nIt is indeed opportune that we are crafting our \r\ntransformation agenda when intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the post-2015 global development \r\nframework have begun in earnest. I am glad that the \r\nAssembly will debate that issue at this session, and I \r\ncommend the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \r\non the Post-2015 Development Agenda, co-chaired by \r\nthe Presidents of Indonesia and Liberia and the Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom, for presenting their \r\ncomprehensive report, A New Global Partnership: \r\nEradicate Poverty and Transform Economies through \r\nSustainable Development, to the Secretary-General. I \r\nhope that the report will provide valuable input for our \r\ndiscussions of the theme “The post-2015 development \r\nagenda: setting the stage” during this session.\r\nAfrica considers this issue to be of paramount \r\nimportance and has formed a high-level committee of \r\nHeads of State and Government to develop a common \r\nposition and galvanize international support in order \r\nto ensure that the successes achieved thus far in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nare sustained and its development priorities beyond \r\n2015 are fully taken on board. As the able Executive \r\nSecretary of the United Nations Economic Commission \r\nfor Africa (UNECA) has aptly put it, what Africa needs \r\nis structural transformation, not structural adjustment. \r\nThe development agenda we are trying to set for Africa \r\nover the next 50 years is also aimed at achieving that \r\nfundamental objective, with a view to eradicating \r\npoverty and ensuring sustainable development. With \r\nrespect to the work of the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals, we intend to come up \r\nwith a well-thought-out African position as an outcome \r\nthat African countries constitute one of the largest \r\ngroups in the General Assembly. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to express my profound appreciation \r\nfor the invaluable contribution of the United Nations \r\nto the decolonization process. However, we should not \r\nlose sight of the fact that not all the challenges we faced \r\nin that struggle have been definitively settled; nor can \r\nwe say that the process of decolonization has come to \r\nan end in all its forms. We should therefore renew our \r\ncommitment to completing the decolonization process \r\nin Africa.\r\nIn accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter, \r\nthe United Nations has indeed worked closely with \r\nthe African Union and other regional mechanisms \r\nto advance its primary objectives. Over the past \r\nfive decades and more, cooperation and partnership \r\nbetween the OAU/AU and the United Nations have \r\nsignificantly expanded and deepened in a wide range of \r\naspects and fields. We acknowledge with deep respect \r\nthe meaningful cooperation that the United Nations has \r\nprovided to the then OAU and now to the African Union \r\nin addressing our continent’s multifaceted challenges. \r\nDespite that fact, we are also cognizant of the \r\nfact that a lot remains to be done to further enhance \r\nthe cooperation and partnership between the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations in the context of the \r\nchanging dynamics within Africa and in the world at \r\nlarge. I earnestly hope that this historic occasion will \r\nafford us a unique opportunity to reflect seriously \r\non our challenges and shortcomings with a view to \r\nstrengthening our cooperation and partnership so as to \r\nbetter respond to the changing environment. I believe \r\nwe should adopt a f lexible and innovative approach \r\nin implementing Chapter VIII of the Charter in order \r\nto enhance our partnership and address our common \r\nchallenges.\r\nWe are celebrating the OAU/AU’s golden jubilee at \r\na time when the stereotypical narrative of Africa as a \r\ncontinent aff licted by poverty, disease and conflict has \r\nslowly begun to change. In spite of so many persistent \r\ndifficulties, Africa has indeed turned the corner in \r\nreducing the number of conflicts plaguing the continent \r\nand in promoting democratic governance, as well as in \r\nfighting poverty through accelerated economic growth \r\nand development. With its enhanced peace and stability, \r\nrapid economic growth, natural resources and growing \r\nmiddle class, Africa is definitely on the rise, and that \r\nis attracting much attention from the rest of the world. \r\nThe twenty-first century will be an African one if we \r\n13-48557 25/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nIn that regard, the African Union has been \r\nexerting efforts to assist Egypt — a member State \r\nwhose contribution to the decolonization process on \r\nour continent and to African unity has been second \r\nto none — to overcome its current difficulties in the \r\nspirit of African solidarity. The African Union is also \r\nextending all the necessary support to Tunisia in order \r\nto ensure a successful political transition through \r\nthe adoption of a new constitution and the holding of \r\nelections.\r\nOn the other hand, we welcome the successful \r\nconduct of elections in Mali that paved the way for the \r\nrestoration of constitutional order in that country. The \r\nAfrican Union is indeed firmly committed to continue \r\nassisting Mali in its efforts to ensure lasting peace, \r\nsecurity and development. We derive satisfaction from \r\nthe significant progress made in Somalia towards \r\npeace in the country, and we are also encouraged by \r\nthe agreement reached between the Federal Republic \r\nof Somalia and the Juba Interim Administration, which \r\nconstitutes a significant milestone in promoting peace \r\nand national reconciliation. The New Deal announced \r\nat the Somalia Conference in Brussels on 16 September \r\nwill certainly strengthen the momentum for the \r\nreconstruction of the country and building peace there.\r\nThe security and humanitarian situation in Central \r\nAfrican Republic is still a matter of serious concern. I \r\nwish to reiterate our call to the United Nations to provide \r\nmultifaceted support to the African-led International \r\nSupport Mission in the Central African Republic, which \r\nwill be deployed in that country to protect civilians and \r\nrestore security and public order. On the other hand, \r\nthe escalation of tension in the eastern Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo also poses threats to the peace \r\nand security of the Great Lakes region and the continent \r\nas a whole. The only durable solution is for both the \r\nGovernment and the armed opposition to conclude \r\ntheir peace talks under the auspices of the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR). In \r\nthat connection, I would like to welcome the outcome \r\nof the ICGLR Extraordinary Summit held in Kampala \r\non 5 September 2013 and High-level Political Forum \r\non Sustainable Development held in New York on \r\n23 September in New York under the auspices of the \r\nPresident of the Assembly.\r\nWith regard to relations between the Sudan and \r\nSouth Sudan, the African Union, in close collaboration \r\nwith the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, \r\nhas established an ad hoc investigation mechanism to \r\nof the initiative of our troika: the African Union \r\nCommission, UNECA and the African Development \r\nBank.\r\nIn that context, we want to achieve a green \r\nrevolution in Africa and ensure food security for our \r\npeoples. The theme of the African Union in 2014 will \r\nbe “Agriculture and food security” and will promote \r\nthe Comprehensive African Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, which will allow us to reinforce our \r\ncommitment to the transformation of the agricultural \r\nsector in Africa.\r\nWe are also convinced of the need for Africa \r\nto industrialize in order to accelerate its economic \r\ngrowth, generate employment, increase income and \r\ndiversify exports. That can be done on the basis of our \r\nfactor endowments and taking into account the need \r\nfor us to increase added value and exploit forward \r\nand backward linkages. It cannot be emphasized \r\nenough that overcoming poverty is impossible without \r\nstructural transformation and value addition, which \r\nmakes industrialization not an option but a must — an \r\nunavoidable necessity for Africa. Let me state here how \r\ngrateful we are to all those who have made partnerships \r\navailable to us to ensure that Africa develops the \r\ncapacity for modern and affordable energy, without \r\nwhich industrialization would be impossible to achieve.\r\nFurthermore, we would like to invest in \r\ninfrastructure, which has been neglected over past \r\ndecades, in order to promote intra-African trade and \r\nfast-track regional integration. We are also committed \r\nto redoubling our efforts to improve the overall well-\r\nbeing of our society. In particular, we believe that Africa \r\nshould reap the benefits of its demographic dividend \r\nby investing in its people. Educating our youth and \r\nupgrading their skills is critical to the effective use of \r\nour human capital. Therefore we very much hope that \r\nthe post-2015 global development framework will be \r\naligned to our development priorities and needs.\r\nWe in Africa certainly recognize that we cannot \r\nrealize our development aspirations in the absence \r\nof durable peace and security. That is why we have \r\nconcentrated tremendous efforts in addressing the \r\nscourge of conflicts on our continent. We are indeed \r\nvery pleased to note the drastic decline in the number \r\nof conflicts in Africa during the last decade, with the \r\nexception of a few situations. But we also understand \r\nthat there is a new security dynamic on our continent, \r\nwith the rise of popular dissatisfaction associated with \r\ndemands yet unmet.\r\n26/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nto support the peacebuilding and national reconciliation \r\nprocesses in the country. The recent decision of the \r\nICC in relation to the Kenyan situation is unhelpful and \r\nadversely affects the ability of the Kenyan leaders in \r\nthe discharge of their constitutional responsibilities. \r\nTherefore I would like to take this opportunity to once \r\nagain urge the Security Council to respond to our \r\nrequests.\r\nIn an increasingly globalized and multipolar world, \r\nAfrica obviously needs to forge multiple partnerships \r\nto realize its development aspirations and assume its \r\nrightful place in the international arena. It gives me great \r\nsatisfaction to note that Africa’s strategic partnership \r\nwith both developed and emerging economies has \r\nexpanded and deepened in recent years. That is the path \r\nwe wish to pursue. Africa needs the solidarity of all \r\nsections of the international community, and it is our \r\nhope that all the necessary support will be extended \r\nto Africa in the spirit of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), which underlined so emphatically the \r\nspecial situation of Africa. That, in our view, should be \r\nthe spirit with which the deficit in the implementation \r\nof Millennium Development Goal 8 must be treated \r\nduring the very short time remaining.\r\nIn conclusion I wish to underline Africa’s enduring \r\ncommitment to this indispensable global body — a \r\nuniversal organization whose viability is an existential \r\nnecessity. It is in that spirit that Africa will continue to \r\nnurture its close cooperation with the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and \r\nChairperson of the African Union for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nverify allegations made by the two countries regarding \r\neach country’s support for and harbouring of dissident \r\nelements that act against the other. The team is carrying \r\nout its work, and I am hopeful that the outcome of \r\nthe investigation will help the two countries to move \r\nforward in the implementation of the agreements they \r\nhave signed and in the normalization of their relations. \r\nOn a more practical level, the summits and the regular \r\nengagement that the leaders of the two countries are \r\nhaving will go a long way in breaking the impasse and \r\nresolving some of the difficult outstanding issues.\r\nI would like to raise one important issue that has \r\nbeen a matter of serious concern for us in our efforts \r\nto promote peace, security and national reconciliation \r\non the continent and regarding which there is a strong \r\nconsensus in Africa. Time and again, we in Africa \r\nhave affirmed our unflinching commitment to fighting \r\nimpunity and promoting democracy, rule of law and good \r\ngovernance throughout the continent, in conformity \r\nwith the Constitutive Act of the African Union. That \r\ncommitment has been empirically validated by bold \r\nactions taken recently by the African Union.\r\nWhen it comes to the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), many of our member States ratified the \r\nRome Statute faithfully, subscribing to its cardinal \r\nobjectives and principles. Unfortunately, the manner in \r\nwhich the ICC has been operating has left a very bad \r\nimpression in Africa. Instead of promoting justice and \r\nreconciliation and contributing to peace and stability, \r\nit has degenerated into a political instrument targeting \r\nAfrica and Africans. This is totally unacceptable, \r\nand that is why Africa has been expressing its serious \r\nreservations against the body.\r\nIt is regrettable that our repeated request to \r\nthe United Nations Security Council to defer the \r\nproceedings initiated against President A1-Bashir \r\nhas been neither heard nor acted upon. We have also \r\nreceived no response to our request for a deferral of \r\nthe ICC investigations and prosecutions in relation \r\nto the 2008 post-election violence in Kenya, in line \r\nwith the principle of complementarity, to allow for a \r\nnational mechanism to investigate and prosecute the \r\ncases under a reformed judiciary provided for in the \r\nnew constitutional dispensation.\r\nIn light of the encouraging developments in Kenya \r\nwith the adoption of the new Constitution, the reform \r\nof the judiciary and the holding of successful legislative \r\nand presidential elections, we believe it is very critical \r\n13-48557 27/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nThirteen years have gone by, and what do we, as a \r\nglobal community, have to show in terms of concrete \r\nresults? No matter which side of the lens we look \r\nthrough, something is appallingly wrong. With less \r\nthan two years to go before 2015, we must ask ourselves \r\nas leaders why those commitments, related to the most \r\nsignificant global declaration made to the world’s most \r\nvulnerable people, are not being fulfilled.\r\nIt is important for me to be extremely clear. I am \r\nnot here to declare the MDGs dead, nor am I advocating \r\nthat they be interred. Rather, I remain convinced that \r\nthey can still be refocused, reformed, reshaped and \r\nrebranded into a new mechanism post-2015.\r\nWe find ourselves standing at the precipice of 2015, \r\nthat crucial defining moment. The current moment \r\nis captured by notable but uneven developments in \r\nsome crucial areas. Considerable gaps remain and new \r\nchallenges have emerged. As leaders we must therefore \r\nacknowledge that now more than ever, through the \r\nprocess of globalization, individuals and societies \r\nfrom one corner of the Earth to another, from oceans \r\nand continents, are intricately connected and more \r\ninterdependent than ever before. Therefore, a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda must concede that fact and be \r\nguided by that reality. \r\nThe deliberations for international collaboration \r\nand development ahead of 2015 present the opportunity \r\nto redirect previous notions of prosperity and \r\ndevelopment among nations. Considering the current \r\nworld economic, social and environmental challenges, \r\nthat is indisputably critical.\r\nWe must concede that the current structure of the \r\ninternationally agreed development goals does not \r\nprovide satisfactory remedies to our universal problems, \r\nwhich include an increase in global warming, the \r\nescalating gap between the worlds’s rich and the poor, \r\nthe further deterioration of the world’s financial system \r\nand the uneven roles that developed and developing \r\ncountries play in responding to and addressing issues \r\nof universal importance and impact on our societies. \r\nTaking into account some of those shortcomings, now \r\nis the opportune time for setting the stage for a post-\r\n2015 development agenda that is all-inclusive, effective \r\nand pragmatic.\r\nOf concern to Antigua and Barbuda are the failings \r\nof the international community in fulfilling the aims \r\nand objectives outlined in the Barbados Programme \r\nof Action for the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Winston Baldwin \r\nSpencer, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Antigua and Barbuda, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Spencer (Antigua and Barbuda): I stand in the \r\nHall today as the leader of one of the smallest countries \r\nin the world — small by size, population and resources. \r\nI also stand here today with a proud heart and a strong \r\nvoice because my small country of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda has produced a giant in the world’s geopolitical \r\nsphere. He is among the finest and most accomplished \r\ndiplomats to have ever walked these great halls. The \r\nGovernment and people of Antigua and Barbuda send \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Ambassador John \r\nWilliam Ashe on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session. We are beyond \r\nsure that he will guide this body through a successful \r\nsession. I offer congratulations also to his predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, on a job well done \r\nand for his unrelenting service to the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nExactly five years ago today, I stood in this \r\nhallowed Hall and stated that: \r\n“We are all members of one body. The welfare \r\nof the weakest and the welfare of the most powerful \r\nare inseparably bound together. Industry cannot \r\nf lourish if labour languishes. Transportation \r\ncannot prosper if manufacturing declines. The \r\ngeneral welfare cannot be provided for in any one \r\nact, but it is well to remember that the benefit of \r\none is the benefit of all, and the neglect of one is the \r\nneglect of all.” (A/64/PV.7, p. 32)\r\nWith the ever-increasing gaps in equality among \r\nnations, the challenges for developing countries over \r\nthe years have remained vast. In trying to address \r\nthe issue of inequality and to diminish very basic \r\nhuman challenges by 2015, world leaders adopted \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The \r\nMDGs were described as a milestone in international \r\ncooperation. With a 15-year timespan for their \r\nimplementation, the Declaration was widely expected \r\nto inspire development and to directly improve the lives \r\nof hundreds of millions of people. They are the people \r\nwho are struggling to survive in the most basic living \r\nconditions and who are suffering from the effects of \r\npoverty, gender inequities, ill health and environmental \r\ndegradation.\r\n28/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nWe small island States have expressed our profound \r\ndisappointment at the lack of tangible action within \r\nthe negotiations on the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change to protect SIDS and \r\nother vulnerable countries, their peoples, culture, \r\nland and ecosystems. The responsibility for mitigating \r\nclimate change is shared by all nations, developed \r\nand developing. However, developed countries \r\nshould shoulder their moral, ethical and historical \r\nresponsibility for emitting anthropogenic greenhouse \r\ngases into the atmosphere. It is those actions that have \r\nnow put the planet in jeopardy and compromised the \r\nwell-being of present and future generations.\r\nVulnerable developing societies such as ours are \r\nalso victims of the globalization of crime, notably \r\nin the havoc wrought by handguns in the possession \r\nof criminal elements, by narcotrafficking that is \r\nessentially targeted at markets in developed countries \r\nand by the deportation of criminals to our shores. We \r\nurge the international community, in recognition of \r\nthe link between globalization and crime, to provide \r\ngreater support for the efforts of small island States \r\nsuch as Antigua and Barbuda to address the escalation \r\nof crime and strengthen the rule of law in combating \r\ninternational drug trafficking. We further call on our \r\ndeveloped partners to reduce the practice of deporting \r\nviolent criminals to our shores. Most of those deportees \r\nhave neither connection nor familiarity with our \r\ncountries.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda is proud to be among \r\nthe growing number of States that have signed and \r\nratified the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). The Treaty \r\nwill, among other things, assist Antigua and Barbuda \r\nin enhancing its capacity to tackle the scourge created \r\nby the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons \r\nand their ammunition, which is associated with other \r\ntransboundary crimes, such as drug trafficking. We have \r\nemphasized throughout the process that such crimes \r\nhave had a negative impact on the socioeconomic well-\r\nbeing of our societies. Antigua and Barbuda stresses \r\nthe importance of the early entry into force of the ATT \r\nand will continue to work energetically with Member \r\nStates to ensure its entry into force.\r\nAnother threat to the sustainable development of \r\nsmall island developing States such as Antigua and \r\nBarbuda is the rise in non-communicable diseases \r\n(NCDs). The situation is at an alarming stage, as \r\nhundreds succumb annually. For Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nthe prevention, care and treatment of non-communicable \r\nIsland Developing States (SIDS). The year 2014 will \r\nmark the twentieth anniversary of the first Global \r\nConference on the Sustainable Development of Small \r\nIsland Developing States, which was held in Barbados \r\nin 1994. \r\nLooking back over the 20 years since that \r\nConference, we see that the international community’s \r\nactions to address the unique and special circumstances \r\nof SIDS have been lacking. It is my hope that the SIDS \r\nconference in Samoa in 2014 will give the international \r\ncommunity the opportunity to correct the wrongs made \r\nand to improve on shortcomings with regard to SIDS. \r\nThe conference will also present us with a third chance \r\nto identify a set of concrete actions, which will be \r\nneeded for the further implementation of the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy for \r\nImplementation and thereby regain momentum lost by \r\nSIDS in the quest for sustainable development.\r\nWe welcome the decision by the United Nations \r\nfamily to designate 2014 as the International Year of \r\nSmall Island Developing States. Antigua and Barbuda \r\npledges to highlight throughout 2014 the issue of SIDS \r\nwith the aim of reinvigorating the SIDS agenda.\r\nMy Government firmly believes in promoting \r\npartnerships supporting sustainable development based \r\non the principles of mutual respect and understanding, \r\nequality and a genuine desire to affect the social and \r\neconomic development of all. My Government has \r\ndeepened our integration efforts with our Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) brothers and sisters, focusing \r\non fully implementing the CARICOM Single Market \r\nand Economy, as well as deepening the various \r\nsubregional regulatory frameworks.\r\nAs a member of the smaller grouping of the \r\nOrganization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), \r\nAntigua and Barbuda has fully joined and endorsed the \r\nOECS economic union in an effort to build on the shared \r\ntradition of our subregional integration arrangements \r\nand to expand the areas of shared sovereignty in order \r\nto survive and ultimately thrive. At the same time, \r\nmy Government has secured full participation in the \r\nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \r\nand the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, as we seek to further strengthen the integration \r\nand development of Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nIt is a recognized fact, but one worth repeating, that \r\nsmall island States contribute the least to the causes \r\nof climate change yet suffer the most from its effects. \r\n13-48557 29/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nsecond-largest sector of our economy after tourism. \r\nMore than jobs are at stake here. The WTO must be \r\nseen to deliver justice to its members, especially one \r\nof its smallest constituents. If not, its credibility as the \r\narbiter of international trade disputes will bleed into \r\nthe dust and hollow out its noble intentions.\r\nAs a part of the Caribbean and a member of the \r\nCARICOM family, Antigua and Barbuda supports the \r\npreservation of the sovereignty of every nation. We are \r\ntherefore very proud of our long-standing relationship \r\nwith the Republic of Cuba. My Government condemns \r\nin the strongest possible terms any discriminatory or \r\nretaliatory policies and practices designed to prevent \r\nCuba from exercising its right to freely participate \r\nin the affairs of our hemisphere. Today, I once again \r\nreiterate my Government’s firm condemnation of the \r\nunilateral and extraterritorial application of coercive \r\nlaws and measures contrary to international law, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the principles of \r\nfree navigation and international trade. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda therefore urges the United States of America \r\nto respect and take note of the unceasing call by the \r\nMembers of the United Nations that it immediately \r\nlift the unjust economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade imposed on the Republic of Cuba. These and \r\nother associated measures serve no other end than to \r\nhinder the socioeconomic development and well-being \r\nof the people of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda also affirms its long-standing \r\nstance and commitment towards combating terrorism \r\nin all its forms and expressions and condemns any \r\naction which goes against international law, resolutions \r\nof the United Nations or principles of human rights \r\nprotection. We therefore condemn the recent terrorist \r\nacts in Kenya and express our profound sympathy to \r\nthe Government of President Uhuru Kenyatta and the \r\nfamilies of those who lost loved ones. We also in the \r\nstrongest sense condemn acts of terrorism in other \r\nparts of the world.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda also expresses its concern \r\nabout the inclusion of the Republic of Cuba on the list \r\nof State sponsors of terrorism published by the State \r\nDepartment of the United States of America. We reject \r\nthe unilateral elaboration of blacklists accusing States \r\nof allegedly supporting and sponsoring terrorism, \r\nwhich is inconsistent with international law. We request \r\nthe United States of America to put an end to that \r\nunilateral practice.\r\ndiseases continue to be a challenge. Heart disease, \r\ndiabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic \r\nrespiratory diseases continue to be the leading causes of \r\ndeath in our region. Our health-care system, economy \r\nand population are heavily burdened by NCDs; it is for \r\nthat reason that my Government has become even more \r\nproactive in addressing the issue. Health care continues \r\nto be basically free for Antiguans and Barbudans, and \r\nthe Government often helps citizens seek treatment \r\nabroad when our facilities at home are unable to provide \r\nit. I ask the Assembly to continue to keep the issue of \r\nNCDs high on its agenda.\r\nMy small developing nation of Antigua and Barbuda \r\nhas sought to ensure that the trade rules agreed to by a \r\nmajority of members of the international community, \r\nincluding the United States of America, are adhered \r\nto. I take this opportunity to once again draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to a trade dispute between my \r\ncountry and the United States of America that has been \r\nongoing for a decade and which has been submitted \r\nto the dispute settlement system of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO). I draw the Assembly’s attention \r\nto the dispute because I believe it has the potential to \r\ndamage the credibility and undermine the utility of \r\nthe WTO’s dispute settlement system and of the WTO \r\nitself. \r\nMy Government won the case at both the original \r\nand appellate levels and yet, a decade later, the end \r\nis not in sight. It is a case that pits the world’s largest \r\neconomy against one of the smallest, and despite our \r\nbest efforts, our patient negotiations with the United \r\nStates of America have borne no fruit. The United States \r\nof America has neither removed the offending laws nor \r\nagreed on a fair settlement with Antigua and Barbuda \r\nthat would compensate for the wanton destruction of an \r\nentire economic sector. We believe that it is a blow to \r\nthe credibility of the WTO to allow the world’s largest \r\neconomy and the WTO’s most powerful member to \r\nignore the lawful decision of its dispute settlement \r\ntribunal without consequences. The international \r\ntrading system will not long survive such a profound \r\nchallenge, and we call on the United States to correct \r\npast wrongs and come to the table with meaningful \r\nproposals that can bring the matter to a just conclusion. \r\nAlthough my Government has until now \r\nexercised strategic patience, we intend, through the \r\nonly mechanism that the WTO has provided, to seek \r\ncompensation for the thousands of jobs lost, the \r\ncompanies collapsed and the general devastation of the \r\n30/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\ninternational courts should move to act in a manner \r\nconsistent with international laws and norms.\r\nWar, or even the threat of war, should be an \r\nabsolute last resort and should have the full support \r\nof the international community at all times. Unilateral \r\nprescriptions will never solve a problem.\r\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda if world leaders stand idle and \r\nsee the tears and desperation on the faces of the many \r\nchildren who are hungry. We cannot successfully \r\nachieve a post-2015 development agenda if world \r\nleaders allow easily treatable illnesses and diseases to \r\ndestroy our populations.\r\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda if world leaders sit back and allow \r\nthe lines of class divisions and insurmountable social \r\nbarriers to increase.\r\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda if world leaders continue to \r\nallow the imbalances of economic growth, destructive \r\ntrade barriers and protectionism from developed to \r\ndeveloping countries to persist. \r\nWe cannot successfully achieve a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda if world leaders do not act to save \r\nour environment and stop the pollution of our air and \r\noceans and the wanton destruction of our forests and \r\nlands only for the benefit of a few.\r\nWhen the founders of the United Nations formulated \r\nthis great institution, it was not envisioned as a stage or \r\na repository for eloquent speeches. The United Nations \r\nwas conceptualized as a place where our challenges \r\nwould be discussed, solutions cultivated and action \r\ntaken.\r\nIt is for those reasons that our leaders gathered here \r\ntoday should work towards a fundamental, impartial \r\nand sustainable social, economic and environmental \r\npost-2015 development agenda that is far-reaching and \r\nall-inclusive. Anything less would be unacceptable \r\nand would be a travesty for millions of the world’s \r\ninhabitants, for whom we are required to act and do so \r\ncourageously and decisively.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and Barbuda \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda welcomes the launch of the \r\ndesign for a permanent memorial to honour the victims \r\nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, an initiative \r\nthat was championed by CARICOM. We also look \r\nforward to its full erection in the coming months.\r\nOne year ago, I stood here and reiterated the need \r\nfor serious dialogue on the topic of reparations. Today \r\nI am proud that the members of CARICOM, at its \r\nthirty-fourth Regular Meeting of the Conference of \r\nHeads of Government, held in Trinidad and Tobago in \r\nJuly, agreed to support the establishment of a regional \r\nreparations commission to begin laying the groundwork \r\nfor a process of engagement and conversation on the \r\nissue of reparations for native genocide and slavery.\r\nI am equally pleased that the first regional \r\nreparations conference was held in St. Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines earlier this month, with proposals for the \r\nformalization of a regional reparations commission. \r\nAntigua and Barbuda therefore conceptualizes the \r\ncall for reparations as an integral element of our \r\ndevelopment strategy and believes that the legacy of \r\nslavery and colonialism in the Caribbean has severely \r\nimpaired our development options. We therefore assert \r\nthat reparations must be directed towards repairing the \r\ndamage inflicted by slavery and racism.\r\nWe have recently seen a number of leaders \r\napologizing to the African diaspora, to indigenous \r\npeoples and to former colonies for past wrongs and \r\ninjustices. I salute those leaders who have demonstrated \r\nsuch enlightenment and strongly encourage others to \r\ndo so and equally match their words with concrete and \r\nmaterial benefits to the descendants of genocide and \r\nthe brutal enslavement of their ancestors.\r\nMy country, while developmentally focused, \r\nis mindful of other global issues, particularly with \r\nreference to peace and security. The continued unrest in \r\nthe Middle East, particularly in Syria, is heartbreaking. \r\nThe images of innocent women and children being \r\ndisplaced and killed tug at my consciousness. Antigua \r\nand Barbuda gives its unconditional support to the \r\npreservation of the role of the United Nations and other \r\norganizations in working towards stabilization and \r\npeace in Syria and other conflict-ridden countries.\r\nIn the same vein, we call on those leaders to \r\nprotect civilians at all costs and move quickly to \r\ndevise diplomatic solutions to the conflicts. Wilful \r\nand deliberate attacks upon civilians should be taken \r\nseriously by the international community, and the \r\n13-48557 31/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\ntenants, demands accountability and transparency from \r\nGovernment officials, builds strong and independent \r\ninstitutions and replaces our old weighted electoral \r\nsystem with one based on the principle of one person, \r\none vote, one value. That historic achievement is the \r\nculmination of a path that Fiji embarked on in 2007 \r\nto establish a modern and stable society that can be a \r\nproud and responsible part of the global community. \r\nFor years we struggled to be a nation under a system \r\nthat created different classes of citizens and in which \r\nthe votes of some Fijians counted more than others. \r\nHow could we be one nation when our fundamental law \r\nsaid that we were not one people? The very idea of a \r\njust and equal society, of an accountable Government \r\nand of loyalty to the nation State was being eroded from \r\nwithin. There were too many elites who thought the \r\nbest way to entrench their own privileges was to sow \r\nthe seeds of division and undermine our independent \r\ninstitutions. The removals of the Government in 1987 \r\nand 2000 were the most radical expressions of that \r\ndysfunction.\r\nAs a result, tens of thousands of Fijians suffered, \r\nand many made the decision to leave their home \r\nforever — to leave Fiji. As I have said before, that is \r\none of the most shameful episodes of our history, and \r\nI am determined that it must never, ever happen again. \r\nWe must never allow a fellow citizen to be second class \r\nor to be less than an equal of his neighbour. Surely, such \r\na basic principle as that deserves the full support of all \r\nnations that would never accept any less for their own \r\npeople.\r\nSo we have set out to make a change for the good, a \r\npermanent change that would set the nation on a straight \r\ncourse and allow Fiji to finally reach the potential \r\nit had when we so enthusiastically embraced our \r\nindependence. It has been a long journey, and we have \r\nfaced numerous challenges along the way. But it is with \r\ngreat pleasure and deep honour that I stand here today \r\nand say: our national compass has finally been reset. \r\nUnder the new Constitution, we are heading towards \r\nFiji’s first genuinely democratic elections by September \r\n2014 and a much brighter future as one nation.\r\nWith every month that passes, we are building \r\nthe foundations of our new parliamentary democracy. \r\nUnlike in the past, we are building a credible and fair \r\nsystem that will guide that process. Four political \r\nparties have registered thus far under the new laws, \r\nwhich create transparency and accountability, and \r\nMr. Winston Baldwin Spencer, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Fiji and Commander \r\nof the Fiji Military Forces \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Fiji and Commander of the Fiji Military Forces.\r\nMr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji and Commander of the Fiji Military \r\nForces, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Fiji and Commander \r\nof the Fiji Military Forces, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Bainimarama (Fiji): At the outset, I wish \r\nto congratulate President Ashe on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession and express my confidence that under his able \r\nand wise guidance, the Assembly will successfully \r\naccomplish its many tasks. I would also like to pay \r\ntribute to the tireless efforts of last year’s President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Vuk Jeremić, and extend my appreciation \r\nfor the effectiveness with which he directed the work of \r\nthe Assembly at the previous session.\r\nFiji reached a pivotal moment in its history earlier \r\nthis month, when His Excellency the President of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji promulgated the nation’s new \r\nConstitution. This Constitution introduces the first \r\ngenuine democracy that Fiji will enjoy since we gained \r\nindependence from the United Kingdom in 1970. Forty-\r\nthree years and three Constitutions later, we finally \r\nhave a Constitution that is worthy of the Fijian people. \r\nIt is a Constitution that meets the test of a genuine \r\ndemocracy, that upholds the legal and moral basis of a \r\ncommon and equal citizenry without denying anyone’s \r\nindividuality or culture. \r\nThe 2013 Fijian Constitution enshrines principles \r\nthat are at the heart of all the world’s great liberal \r\ndemocracies: an independent judiciary, a secular State \r\nand a wide range of civil, political and socioeconomic \r\nrights. It recognizes the indigenous peoples of Fiji and \r\ntheir customary practices, protects the rights of the \r\npredominantly indigenous landowners and those of their \r\n32/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nwealth accumulation and technological advances, the \r\nrift that divides the rich and the poor zones of the world \r\never widens. We must therefore not lose focus on one \r\nimperative of our time: equality among nations, big and \r\nsmall, is central to the relevance, credibility and even \r\nsurvival of this global Organization.\r\nIn that regard, we are encouraged by the progress \r\nmade thus far in the General Assembly towards \r\nexpeditiously launching the follow-up mechanisms \r\nagreed at the Rio+20 Conference in 2012. Throughout \r\nthe course of this year, the Group of 77 and China \r\nhas emphasized that the road map towards a post-\r\n2015 development agenda needs to address the \r\nimplementation gaps of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, with poverty eradication remaining an \r\noverarching goal. The new development agenda must \r\nbe universal, applicable and relevant to all Member \r\nStates. Let me also stress that the new development \r\nagenda should be centred on economic development \r\nthat supports both social inclusion and environmental \r\nsustainability.\r\nOur common desire for a transformative global \r\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015 can best be achieved \r\nthrough collective efforts and an enhanced global \r\npartnership. Such efforts must place the development \r\nand well-being of people at its core. If the international \r\ncommunity and national Governments seriously \r\ncommit to an agenda for meaningful transformation \r\nat the structural, institutional and normative levels, \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda has the potential of \r\nachieving a paradigm shift in global conditions.\r\nFiji’s commitment to being a good global citizen \r\nis manifested through our ongoing engagement with \r\nthe United Nations and its associated agencies and \r\nsecretariats. Our decision to take on the mantle of \r\nchairing the Group of 77 and China for the year 2013 \r\nwas informed by the fact that Fiji embraces its rights \r\nas an equal Member of the United Nations and that we \r\nmust therefore also carry all the due responsibilities \r\nexpected of us within this great family of nations.\r\nFiji’s commitment to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nremains unwavering. It is a source of great pride \r\nthat, for a nation of our size, we are able to make a \r\nmeaningful and significant contribution. For the past \r\nthree decades, we have always responded to the call \r\nof the United Nations to serve, including in the most \r\ndifficult circumstances around the world. While we \r\nfully recognize the risks involved, Fiji’s confidence in \r\nclose to 540,000 Fijians — out of an estimated 620,000 \r\neligible voters — have registered for the 2014 election.\r\nMany modern, stable democracies have gone \r\nthrough their own turbulent periods. Some have gone \r\nthrough decades of instability and bloodshed, while \r\nothers have had a single defining moment. Those \r\nevents changed the course of history. They turned \r\ntheir countries from bastions of elitism and oppression \r\ninto nations of freedom, equality and true democracy. \r\nThe United States has its Bunker Hill and Civil War. \r\nFrance has the storming of the Bastille and the French \r\nrevolution. Australia has the Eureka Stockade, and \r\nBritain has had a bloody history as it struggled to \r\nestablish a constitutional monarchy. We Fijians have \r\nalso had our share of turbulence.\r\nRegrettably and to our great disappointment, some \r\nof our oldest friends had no faith in us. They abandoned \r\nus and sought to punish us with sanctions. We sought \r\ntheir assistance and understanding, but they turned \r\ntheir backs on us. They chose to support a form of \r\ndemocracy, governance and justice in Fiji that they \r\nwould never have accepted for themselves. We hope \r\nthat they see now that we were true to our word. All \r\nnations struggle over time to overcome their unique \r\nchallenges, to correct historic sins and to be worthy of \r\nthe principles on which they were founded. We in Fiji \r\nare no different. Our isolation led us to seek out new \r\nrelationships, which have proven fruitful. Now, our \r\nstanding in the world has never been stronger. \r\nA key principle that has guided Fiji’s political \r\ndevelopment and foreign policy and is soundly \r\ngrounded in the Charter of the United Nations is \r\nthat we determine our own destinies as sovereign \r\nStates. At the same time, we recognize the necessity \r\nof collaborating with all Member States of the United \r\nNations with the aim of supporting sustainable world \r\npeace, substantive justice, dignity and respect for all. It \r\nis that spirit of collaboration that has inspired us to go \r\nbeyond parochial interests and reach out to help others. \r\nThat spirit enjoins us to be loyal to common ideals, \r\ngoals, values and principles. They remain our guiding \r\nbeacons as we navigate our way in this millennium.\r\nThe theme set by the President to guide the general \r\ndebate at this sixty-eighth session, which is “The \r\npost-2015 development agenda: setting the stage,” \r\nis most fitting for the juncture at which the United \r\nNations stands. In the midst of increasing poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment and during an era of unprecedented \r\n13-48557 33/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nThe United Nations efforts to eradicate colonialism \r\nmust forge ahead within the context of the Special \r\nPolitical and Decolonization Committee, of which \r\nFiji is a member. Through the Pacific regional body \r\nknown as the Melanesian Spearhead Group, Fiji works \r\ntogether with other members of the Fourth Committee \r\nto accelerate the process of decolonization.\r\nIn reforming and developing its information and \r\ncommunication technology (ICT) infrastructure, Fiji \r\nhas adopted a comprehensive approach by combining a \r\nnational framework for ICT development with effective \r\nand pragmatic policies and initiatives to deliver results \r\ndirectly to the Fijian people. That approach is bearing \r\nfruit. Fiji has achieved 95 per cebt mobile coverage, \r\nincluding 3G; concluded one of the region’s first open \r\nauctions for the 4G spectrum; and is implementing a \r\nnumber of innovative initiatives to increase affordable \r\naccess and improve services, including in the most \r\nremote parts of our country.\r\nThe International Telecommunication Union, in its \r\nannual review of more than 150 countries’ delivery of \r\nICT infrastructure and services to their populations, \r\ngave special recognition to Fiji as a developing country. \r\nFiji tied for the third largest improvement of any \r\ncountry and is ranked fourth globally in percentage \r\nterms, having improved by 14 per cent.\r\nAs the first country to ratify the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, Fiji has kept its \r\noceanic obligations at the core of its foreign policy. \r\nWhile some disconnect exists between what is \r\ncontained in international instruments and what is or \r\nis not implemented, we need a commitment to clear \r\nsteps to turn words into actions in order to facilitate the \r\nsustainable management of ocean resources and make \r\nequitable the share of benefits from their utilization.\r\nFiji hosted the inaugural Pacific Islands \r\nDevelopment Forum (PIDF) last month. Its formation \r\nmakes the PIDF the only South-South organization in \r\nthe Pacific region that provides for a multi-stakeholder \r\nplatform where Governments, the private sector and \r\ncivil society can discuss what we Pacific Islanders need \r\nto do to achieve sustainable development.\r\nWe look forward to a productive sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Let me reiterate our \r\nfull support and cooperation with President Ashe and \r\nall members with a view to advancing the objectives \r\nof the United Nations and the aspirations of the global \r\ncommunity.\r\nits peacekeepers prompted us to provide troops to the \r\nGolan Heights this year to assist the United Nations in a \r\ntime of need. The many years of service of Fijian troops \r\nin the Middle East region, particularly in Lebanon, \r\nIraq and Sinai, are an asset that our troops take with \r\nthem to that mission. Fiji also sees police peacekeeping \r\nand contributions in the corrections and justice sector \r\nas important in building local State institutions that \r\ncan be run by local authorities once peacekeeping \r\nmissions end, and we are building on our many existing \r\ncommitments in that regard in Liberia, Darfur and \r\nSouth Sudan.\r\nIt is up to us in the General Assembly to ensure \r\nthat all support possible is given to troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries serving on the ground, \r\nincluding through clear and appropriate policy \r\nguidance. For the good of the countries concerned, \r\nwe must not abdicate that responsibility. I urge us \r\nall to work together in the United Nations to provide \r\nsuch concrete policy guidance, particularly as we see \r\npeacekeeping missions evolve into multidimensional \r\nand complex missions that differ greatly from early \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions.\r\nAs a Pacific island nation, Fiji reaffirms its support \r\nfor the efforts of small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nto achieve sustainable development. Not only are SIDS \r\nacutely vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such \r\nas sea-level rise, ocean acidification and the increased \r\nfrequency of extreme weather events, but for some of \r\nus the threat is to our very existence. Our response \r\nto the plight of those most at risk must therefore be \r\ncharacterized by a requisite sense of urgency.\r\nThe convening of the third International Conference \r\nfor Sustainable Development of SIDS in 2014 will be \r\ncritical to addressing, in a very specific and concrete \r\nmanner, the many challenges faced by SIDS. It is \r\nan opportunity for the international community to \r\nrenew its commitment to the implementation of the \r\ndecisions and agreements pertaining to SIDS. As \r\nthe international community discusses the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment landscape, including a successor to the \r\nHyogo Framework for Action, we must ensure that a \r\nnew model accounts for and addresses the risks we \r\nface. This is particularly relevant for SIDS, where \r\nhundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses \r\noccur as a result of so-called natural disasters every \r\nyear. Protecting development gains and investing in \r\ndisaster resilience is vital to sustainable development.\r\n34/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nthis respect is indispensable and has been underscored \r\ntime and again by the 28 Governments of the European \r\nUnion. \r\nFollowing the Secretary-General’s report and the \r\ninventory of its arsenal provided by the Syrian regime, \r\nit is urgent for the Security Council, together with the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, \r\nto take the necessary decisions to ensure the swift and \r\nsecure destruction of Syria’s stocks of poison gas and \r\nnerve agents. A clear resolution of the Security Council \r\nwould mark a turn, and I plea for its adoption. \r\nEliminating Syria’s chemical arsenal is in itself \r\na major step. Potentially, it could also be important \r\nfor the wider dynamics in the region. Clearly, the \r\nconflict wrecking Syria reflects many of the deep-\r\nseated tensions rippling throughout the Middle East. It \r\nis fed by these tensions and fuels them as well. So a \r\nsolution for Syria will need to take the wider picture \r\ninto account. That is why any political opening matters \r\ndeeply; a breakthrough on chemical weapons could \r\nstart opening other doors. In the black wall of Syria’s \r\ndoom, it will be a first crack.\r\nParadoxically, there is more scope for quiet hope \r\ntoday than there was even a few weeks ago. Because \r\nif commitments can be upheld and promises kept on \r\nchemical weapons, if lines of communication can reopen, \r\nif we can find an agreement within the international \r\ncommunity and at the Security Council — if we can do \r\nall this on chemical weapons, then chances are we can \r\ndo it elsewhere. \r\nThere must be ways to open up opportunities. But \r\nwhen new opportunities arise, we must seize them. \r\nOnly then will we see the outlook improve for Syria. \r\nNow is indeed the moment to work actively towards the \r\n“Geneva II” conference. The international community \r\nmust fully engage with all available diplomatic \r\nmeans. The first priority is to bring all parties to the \r\nnegotiating table. Those close to Damascus and those \r\nclose to the Syrian opposition must do all within their \r\npower to draw each side to the table. The European \r\nUnion is ready to provide all support needed to achieve \r\na political settlement. \r\nElsewhere in the region too, new opportunities must \r\nand can be seized, not least in the Middle East peace \r\nprocess, where prospects for progress look better than \r\nthey have for some time. All parties are returning to \r\nthe negotiating table with renewed seriousness. For the \r\nEuropean Union, the parameters are clear. Palestine and \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji and Commander of the Military Forces, \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Josaia V. Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji and Commander of the Military \r\nForces, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nStatement by Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the President of the European \r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council, and inviting him to \r\nmake a statement.\r\nMr. Van Rompuy (European Council): A year ago \r\nwhen we met in the General Assembly, we joined our \r\nvoices to deplore the fact that the Syrian civil war had \r\nclaimed over 25,000 lives. One year on, it has killed \r\nover 100,000 men, women and children. The number \r\nof refugees, which stood at 250,000 in September 2012, \r\ndoubled by December that year, then doubled again \r\nby March, and then it doubled again. Today, there are \r\n2 million Syrians outside their country, half of them \r\nchildren, and under current trends, their number is close \r\nto doubling again, and there may be 3.5 million refugees \r\nbefore the year is over. We cannot let this spiral of \r\ncriminal, sectarian violence pursue its dreadful course \r\nat the heart of the world’s most unstable region. What \r\nwill the situation be when we meet again next year?\r\nAny further paralysis of the international \r\ncommunity over Syria is simply untenable. It was \r\nalready true this summer, but worse was yet to come. \r\nFive weeks ago in the outskirts of Damascus, there was \r\na new threshold of tragedy, a crime against humanity, \r\nand in response the stakes were raised. Today we are in \r\na new situation. \r\nThe European Union welcomes the diplomatic \r\nopening created in order to control and destroy \r\nSyria’s chemical weapons. It is important in itself. We \r\nabsolutely must avoid a dreadful precedent being set \r\non the use of chemical weapons — an abhorrent crime \r\nagainst humanity. The role of the United Nations in \r\n13-48557 35/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nSyria eventually find justice and ensuring that there \r\nis no impunity and that individual perpetrators of war \r\ncrimes are held accountable. \r\nWe Europeans are ready to play our part in helping \r\nSyria to rebuild its nation, just as we are engaged today \r\non the ground in the humanitarian effort in Syria and in \r\nthe countries to which refugees have f lown, not least in \r\nLebanon and Jordan, where the situation is extremely \r\nworrying. Our countries and institutions are working \r\nclosely with the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees to bring food, protection and shelter, as \r\nwell as medical help and education. By far the biggest \r\naid provider for Syria, jointly we have already provided \r\n€1.8 billion — some $2.4 billion — and we know that \r\nmore will be needed.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe do so because Europe is ready to continue to \r\nplay its role in the world. To many countries, whether in \r\nAfrica, Latin America or Asia or from the Mediterranean \r\nto the Caspian, the European Union is a faithful partner \r\nin development, peace and security, for the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and world propserity through open \r\ntrade. We are a strong partner in the fight against the \r\nextremism and barbarism of which the events in Kenya, \r\nPakistan and Iraq are recent and tragic manifestations.\r\nDespite the financial crisis that is testing our \r\neconomies, we do not disengage from our responsibilities \r\nin the world. Despite the crisis, we have maintained all \r\nEuropean funding for development and humanitarian \r\naction in our common European budget, even as we \r\nreduce its size. Despite the crisis, we maintain our \r\npolitical and financial commitment against climate \r\nchange in Europe and the world, and we will lend our \r\nfull support to the international conference in Paris in \r\n2015.\r\nIndeed, despite the crisis, the European Union \r\nlaunched no fewer than five new European civilian \r\nor military missions over the past two years aimed at \r\nsupporting reconstruction in Mali and South Sudan and \r\nre-establishing security in the Sahel and along Libya’s \r\nborders and off the coast of Somalia. Moreover, in \r\n2013 we renewed operational mandates in Afghanistan, \r\nGeorgia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nIn crisis and conflict areas, the European presence \r\non the ground is composed of doctors, paramedics, \r\nagronomists and engineers; it also includes magistrates \r\nand police and military personnel — men and women \r\nwho assist their local counterparts in efforts to stabilize \r\nIsrael must be able to fulfil their legitimate aspirations \r\nas two States living side by side in peace and security. \r\nNow both parties must seize the moment. \r\nWe also hope that the expectations currently \r\nbuilding around the new Iranian leadership will \r\ntranslate into concrete steps in the interest of regional \r\nstability and for the nuclear talks, where all efforts \r\nto find a negotiated solution, through the work of the \r\nE3+3 led by High Representative Catherine Ashton, \r\nhave the European Union’s full support. Both these \r\ndevelopments — with Israel and Palestine and with \r\nIran — can be mutually reinforcing with what is \r\ncurrently happening around Syria; there, all must be \r\ndone to forge the path to a political solution. \r\nOnce the “Geneva II” conference starts, we have to \r\nbe honest with ourselves. It will not be easy — ending \r\na war never is. It will require political will and a real \r\nsense of compromise. But we must recognize that the \r\ncost of hesitating, of not engaging, would be much \r\nhigher, and not only for the people of Syria. Every \r\nday counts. With every day of unforgivable violence, \r\nbitterness and trauma go deeper, radicalization and \r\nwarlordism gain ground, hatred and despair win. Every \r\nday, reconciliation in Syria and around Syria becomes \r\nharder. \r\nWe in Europe know that reconciliation is the \r\nhardest thing. The countries of our continent agreed \r\nto live peacefully together only after many wars, and \r\nmany civil wars, with huge numbers of victims — a \r\nprice we never want others to have to pay. And we know \r\nreconciliation is even harder inside a country than \r\nbetween countries. No longer waging war is one thing; \r\nliving again together is quite another. \r\nSyria — as a country and a nation — is being \r\ndestroyed beyond recognition. It will take time, \r\ncourage and perseverance to build an inclusive, united, \r\ndemocratic Syria, where all Syrians can feel they \r\nbelong and where all share a common future regardless \r\nof their identity and regardless of their religion. The \r\npromise of the Arab Spring must be met in Syria too, \r\njust as it must in Egypt and beyond. At heart, it is a \r\nshared yearning for democracy, for tolerance, for social \r\njustice — a powerful message in which we still believe. \r\nBut on this long path, the Syrians will need all the \r\nhelp they can get, just as others before, including we in \r\nEurope, received support when mending their nations. \r\nThe United Nations can play an important role in \r\nhelping the country to re-establish unity and in helping \r\n36/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\n20 in Brisbane next year. To exchange words that bring \r\nabout action is itself an act of hope, and it is precisely \r\nhope that we need.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nHope is in our hands.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the European \r\nCouncil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Jaber Al Mubarak Al Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State of \r\nKuwait.\r\nSheikh Jaber Al Mubarak Al Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al Mubarak \r\nAl Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Kuwait, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, it is with pleasure that I extend, \r\non behalf of the Government and people of the State of \r\nKuwait, our sincere congratulations to Mr. Ashe and \r\nto his country, Antigua and Barbuda, upon his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session. We are certain that his vast experience \r\nin international affairs will enable him to conduct the \r\ndeliberations of this session wisely and ably, and we \r\nwish him success in that endeavour. We extend our \r\nthanks to Mr. Vuk Jeremić for his great efforts as \r\nPresident at the previous session. \r\nI should also like to pay tribute to the tremendous \r\nand tireless efforts by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nin leading the Organization and disseminating its lofty \r\nmessage and in seeking to maintain international peace \r\nand security, in fulfilment of the aspirations of the \r\nStates and peoples of the world for a better world that \r\nguarantees a life of dignity for all human beings.\r\nThe State of Kuwait condemns the acts of terrorism \r\ncommitted in a shopping centre in Nairobi on Saturday, \r\na country, re-establish order and the rule of law, restore \r\nthe sense of justice and build confidence in the future.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nEurope is not disengaging, despite the economic \r\ndifficulties that the past few years have brought. The \r\nglobal financial crisis, which started in this very city \r\nfive years ago, shook Europe and brought forth global \r\nimbalances that we have worked hard to address. We \r\nare putting our house in order and expect others to do \r\nso too. Internal imbalances need to be corrected and \r\nstructural reforms pursued in countries all across the \r\nglobe. For us, the results are starting to show. Today the \r\neurozone is in better financial shape than 12 months \r\nago. The existential threat to the euro area is over, and \r\nwe are now focusing fully on improving prospects \r\nfor employment and growth. We have launched far-\r\nreaching efforts, focused on the long term. It will take \r\ntime before results show, in terms of strong economic \r\ngrowth and jobs, but once they start doing so, as they are \r\nnow, they will be longer lasting. Next year, economic \r\ngrowth is projected for all but one of our 28 countries.\r\nOur political will to preserve Europe’s unity cannot \r\nbe underestimated — we have shown it over the past \r\nfive years — for, ultimately, it is a political project that \r\nunites us: to bring together countries; to bring together \r\npeople.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn the month of September 2013, here in New York, \r\nthe international community can and must make a \r\ncomeback. It is our common responsibility, shared by \r\nall of us present here today, to translate the positive \r\nsigns into concrete progress for peace and prosperity. \r\nI therefore call for negotiation, dialogue and the \r\nconclusion of international agreements based on the \r\nconviction — which is at the very foundation of this \r\nOrganization — that international political progress \r\nhappens through the free exchange of ideas among \r\ncountries.\r\nThat holds true for Syria, with regard to both \r\nchemical weapons and the “Geneva II” conference. It \r\nholds true for the Middle East peace process and for \r\nthe nuclear talks with Iran. But it also holds true for \r\nall the other great global challenges. It is from here in \r\nNew York that a new momentum can and must emerge \r\nfor the important upcoming global meetings on climate \r\nchange, in Warsaw in November, on free trade in Bali \r\nin December, or on financial regulation at the Group of \r\n13-48557 37/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nadopted following the understanding reached to transfer \r\nfollow-up responsibility for these matters from the \r\nHigh-level Coordinator on the issue of the repatriation \r\nor return of all Kuwaiti and third-country nationals or \r\ntheir remains to the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nfor Iraq. In this regard, we commend the efforts of \r\nthe Secretary-General and his concern to accelerate \r\nthe closure of these two issues, discover the fate of \r\nthe remaining missing persons and put an end to their \r\nfamilies’ suffering.\r\nMore than two and a half years have passed since \r\nthe eruption of the crisis in Syria. This crisis is more \r\nthan a humanitarian disaster; it is fast approaching the \r\ndefinition of a catastrophe, with the increasing numbers \r\nof victims and missing persons, both internally and \r\nexternally, and the recurring scenes of bloodshed, \r\nviolence, destruction, oppression and violation of \r\nthe most basic principles and values of humankind. \r\nThe scale of the crisis has become an obstacle to any \r\npossible solution that could contain it, despite the great \r\nand continued efforts at the regional and international \r\nlevels. The Security Council has been faced with a \r\nhistoric and decisive responsibility: to start taking \r\nserious and tangible steps to ensure solutions that can \r\nguarantee an end to the bloodshed of the brotherly \r\nSyrian people, achieve their demands and restore \r\nsecurity and stability in their country.\r\nIn January 2013, in response to the suffering of the \r\nSyrian people owing to the exacerbation of the crisis \r\nand its destructive consequences, the State of Kuwait \r\nhosted an international donors conference to support \r\nthe humanitarian situation in Syria. This conference \r\nachieved the desired results, and pledges surpassed \r\nthe targeted amount of $1.5 billion, of which the State \r\nof Kuwait contributed $300 million. This amount has \r\nbeen disbursed in full to a number of United Nations \r\nbodies and agencies, which converted it into emergency \r\nrelief assistance to the Syrian people, inside and outside \r\nSyria. The State of Kuwait would like to thank all \r\ncountries that participated in the donors conference. \r\nTheir participation reflected their care and concern \r\nregarding the deteriorating humanitarian situation in \r\nSyria.\r\nWe all recognize that the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity is the key that opens the doors to a dignified \r\nlife, prosperity and human creativity. This is because \r\nfactors such as development, in all its economic, social, \r\nenvironmental, political and cultural aspects, cannot \r\n21 September. We extend our sincerest condolences to \r\nthe people and Government of Kenya and to the families \r\nof the victims. We also underscore again our support \r\nfor Bahrain and all of the measures being undertaken \r\nthere to strengthen security.\r\nThe maintenance of regional and international peace \r\nand security occupies a position of great importance \r\namong the priorities of the foreign policy of the State \r\nof Kuwait, based on its principles and objectives, the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the provisions of \r\ninternational law, which call for the building of bridges \r\nof confidence, good-neighbourly relations, mutual \r\nrespect and non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nStates, as well as for the promotion of the concepts \r\nof peaceful coexistence and the pursuit of peaceful \r\nsettlements to conflicts and disputes.\r\nIn November 2012, the State of Kuwait celebrated \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of its \r\nConstitution, which was the result of a distinctive \r\nexperience reflecting relations between ruler and \r\nsubject. It evolved in a historically seamless manner \r\ninto a democratic mechanism involving popular \r\nparticipation. That process has embodied the essence \r\nand values of political growth based on a commitment \r\nto working for peace, as well as developing and \r\nstrengthening relations with neighbouring countries \r\nin accordance with the principles of mutual respect, \r\ncommon interests and rising above the wounds of the \r\npast in order to chart a better future for the region and \r\nthe world.\r\nIn that context, I would highlight our bilateral \r\nrelations with the Republic of Iraq and to commend the \r\nefforts of the Iraqi Government to fulfil its international \r\ncommitments to the State of Kuwait, in implementation \r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. Our \r\nbilateral relations have developed in positive and \r\ntangible ways through communications at the highest \r\nlevel between the leadership of both countries. We \r\nhave overcome our past differences and are looking to \r\nthe future to strengthen and develop future bilateral \r\nrelations for the welfare and interests of the peoples of \r\nboth countries.\r\nWe also look forward to genuine cooperation \r\nwith the Republic of Iraq in order to find the remains \r\nof missing Kuwaitis and third-country nationals and \r\nundertake a serious search for the national archives \r\nof the State of Kuwait, in implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2107 (2013). That resolution was \r\n38/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe adoption of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) represented a major shift in the ability \r\nof the United Nations to mobilize the global will to \r\neradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, \r\nthus clearly expressing how ambitious the will of the \r\ninternational community really is and the feasibility of \r\nthis global partnership.\r\nHowever, major new challenges have emerged \r\nthat are related either to security disruptions resulting \r\nfrom instability and the violations of human rights \r\nthat accompany them, or to the steady environmental \r\ndeterioration that threatens our world, together with \r\nother serious and urgent challenges. This requires the \r\ninternational community to take up the inevitable task \r\nof rethinking our preparations for a comprehensive and \r\nambitious development plan. \r\nWe must complement the efforts aimed at achieving \r\nthe MDGs by formulating new goals and incorporating \r\nthem in the post-2015 development plan. This will enable \r\nus to take a quantum leap towards a renewed global \r\npartnership that will complete the process under way \r\non the scientific bases of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and the principles and outcome of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) held in Brazil. It should help \r\nour peoples, to whom those goals represent the hope of \r\ncreating an ideal world and a better life, particularly in \r\nthe least developed countries or those still recovering \r\nfrom wars and conflicts. In this respect, we refer to \r\nthe importance of the international community paying \r\ncareful attention to supporting the foundations of \r\ndevelopment in order to achieve security and stability \r\nin Somalia and Afghanistan.\r\nWhile the State of Kuwait is considered a \r\ndeveloping country, it has been independent since \r\n1961 and given a great deal of attention to providing \r\nfinancial and material assistance to the developing \r\nand least developed countries, through many different \r\nmechanisms and initiatives. The Kuwait Fund for Arab \r\nEconomic Development is a central Kuwaiti institution \r\nfirmly committed to implementing its promises and \r\npolicies on international cooperation and assistance to \r\nneedy people by on the ground. Since its establishment, \r\nand having outgrown its regional Arab scope, the Fund \r\nhas expanded its activities and development assistance \r\nto Asian, African and Central and Latin American \r\ncountries.\r\ntake place when peace and security are lacking or \r\nebbing.\r\nTurning to the Middle East region, Palestine is still \r\nfacing chronic challenges that have disrupted the vision \r\nof a future based on development and regional and \r\ninternational cooperation. The political and security \r\nconditions in the region have also been disrupted by \r\nthe lack of confidence created by Israel’s continued \r\npolicy of building illegal settlements on occupied \r\nPalestinian lands, its continued siege of the Gaza Strip \r\nand the detention of thousands of Palestinians and their \r\nimprisonment in subhuman conditions, in contravention \r\nof the most basic rules of international humanitarian \r\nlaw. Such practices reached their peak after Palestine \r\nreceived Observer State status in the Organization.\r\nIn this regard, we reiterate that only the international \r\ncommunity will be able to find the difficult formula for \r\npeace. We value in this respect the ongoing efforts of \r\nthe United States of America to achieve a breakthrough \r\nin the peace process and hope that persistent efforts and \r\npressure on Israel will make it accept the resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy.\r\nAt the regional level, concerning Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme, the State of Kuwait supports the ongoing \r\nefforts to peacefully resolve this issue in a manner a \r\nthat will preserve the right of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran and all countries in the region to use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes under the supervision and \r\nmonitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA). We also call upon the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to cooperate fully with international efforts and \r\nwork on implementing the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. We also call on Iran to cooperate with the \r\nIAEA and implement its resolutions to find a definitive \r\nsolution to this crisis, which had cast it shadow on this \r\nregion for many years, given rise to doubts and created \r\nan atmosphere of instability and tension.\r\nThis year, the State of Kuwait celebrated the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of its membership in this enduring \r\nOrganization. Ever since then, and driven by its belief \r\nin the importance of common international action, it has \r\nsought to provide highly effective support to many of \r\nthe agencies, bodies and entities of the United Nations \r\nsystem. This is particularly true in view of the growth \r\nand increase in challenges facing the Organization at \r\nall levels and putting the international community, \r\nrepresented by the United Nations, to the test, a test of \r\ninternational will and global partnership in facing these \r\nchallenges.\r\n13-48557 39/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nSheikh Jaber Al Mubarak Al Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Enrico Letta, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Italy\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Italy.\r\nMr. Enrico Letta, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have a great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Enrico Letta, President \r\nof the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Letta (Italy): With an end to the global crisis \r\nfinally within reach, it is imperative to make growth \r\nand development our first priority today. In the past \r\n10 years, remarkable progress on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has been made. But we \r\nhave to work harder. We need to empower individuals \r\nand communities and increase the capacity of economic \r\nand social systems to adapt to the rapid changes of our \r\ncomplex world. \r\nWith regard to the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nwe should address the root causes of the ills aff licting \r\nour world rather than limit ourselves to the side effects. \r\nSustainable development, in line with the outcomes \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, is the best possible antidote. In that \r\nconviction, Italy co-facilitated the establishment of the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \r\nwith universal membership. We are also in favour of \r\nreinforcing the Economic and Social Council and of \r\na partial reform of the United Nations Environment \r\nProgramme.\r\nThe promotion of sustainable development goes \r\nhand in hand with the spread of democratic principles. \r\nWe are in favour of the convergence of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals and the MDGs after 2015. But \r\ndevelopment cannot be simply reduced to economic \r\ngrowth and statistics. We must go beyond gross \r\ndomestic product and pay adequate attention to the \r\nmore comprehensive notion of “quality of life”. \r\nSpecial attention should be paid to the role of \r\nwomen’s rights and gender equality. Although women \r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait has provided \r\nprovisional funding of $500 million to the Republic \r\nof Yemen for development projects in the 2012-2014 \r\nprovisional programme. The contribution seeks \r\nto support a peaceful transition of power pursuant \r\nto the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative and its \r\nImplementation Mechanism, which are aimed at \r\nending the crisis in Yemen, re-establishing security \r\nand stability there, and rehabilitating the development \r\nsectors in order to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of \r\nthe Yemeni people to live in peace and security through \r\nthe consolidation of democracy and good governance.\r\nThe State of Kuwait, through its great interest in \r\npromoting and intensifying regional and international \r\nmultilateral activities by reviewing cooperation and \r\ncoordination measures in many important and political \r\nfields, has hosted many regional and international \r\nsummits, meetings and conferences. All haved focused \r\non a multiplicity of issues, challenges, hopes and \r\naspirations and supported initiatives aimed at creating \r\nbetter conditions for the peoples of the region and the \r\nworld.\r\nIn order to expand that approach, built on \r\ncoordination and a spirit of entrepreneurship, in \r\nNovember the State of Kuwait will host the third \r\nArab-African Summit under the theme “Partners \r\nin Development and Investment”. We hope that \r\nthis initiative will achieve results that deepen the \r\nfoundations of Arab-African cooperation and open \r\nnew horizons in the name of stability, development \r\nand cooperation between the people and countries of \r\nthese two regions. The State of Kuwait will also host \r\nthe thirty-fourth session of the Supreme Council of the \r\nCooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf \r\nin December, as well as the twenty-fifth Summit of \r\nLeague of Arab States in March 2014.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate the commitment of the \r\nState of Kuwait to the international multilateral system \r\nand to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as its belief in the importance \r\nthat all States fulfil the obligations to which they \r\nhave committed in international agreements and \r\nconferences. That will help in the search for just and \r\nequitable solutions to the global threats and challenges \r\nconfronting us in order to achieve the lofty objective of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait for the statement he has just made.\r\n40/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nfundamental human rights of immigrants and prosecute \r\ncriminals who engage in human trafficking. At the \r\nsame time, we have fostered international cooperation \r\nwith the countries of origin and of transit.\r\nOn this crucial subject, I wish to quote Pope Francis, \r\nwho decided to visit the small island of Lampedusa \r\nthis summer. He brought a message of support for the \r\nthousands of immigrants who arrive there from Africa \r\nevery year. We should all fight what he called the \r\n“globalization of indifference” and feel the suffering of \r\nmigrants as our own.\r\nRecognizing that more needs to be done at the \r\nnational and international levels, we look forward \r\nto the second summit of the High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development, to be held in \r\nNew York this October.\r\nAchieving sustainable development requires \r\nstability, security and peace. Since the outbreak of \r\nthe conflict in Syria, the Italian Government has \r\nunderlined the importance of preserving the role of the \r\nUnited Nations as the ultimate guardian of peace. At the \r\nsame time, we strongly condemn what has taken place \r\nin Syria with regard to chemical weapons. We cannot \r\nbe indifferent to blatant violations of fundamental \r\ninternational rights.\r\nItaly invites all members of the Security Council \r\nand other relevant international stakeholders to spare \r\nno effort in the search for political solutions. That is \r\nwhy the Italian Government welcomed the Geneva \r\nframework for the elimination of Syrian chemical \r\nweapons. We strongly support the work undertaken \r\nin the Security Council aimed at inducing Syria to \r\nparticipate in the Chemical Weapons Convention.\r\nWe cannot accept the continuous deterioration of \r\nthe humanitarian situation in Syria and in neighbouring \r\ncountries. Once again, we invite all the parties \r\ninvolved in the conflict to fully respect international \r\nhumanitarian law. There must be effective protection \r\nfor humanitarian assistance.\r\nItaly has intensified humanitarian assistance, \r\nparticularly for refugees. Italy confirms its pledge \r\nof $30 million for 2013 and intends to provide even \r\nmore support to expand the reach of humanitarian \r\nassistance. At the Group of 20 Summit held in Saint \r\nPetersburg, we announced our intention to implement \r\nnew humanitarian and emergency initiatives, for an \r\nadditional $50 million. On Friday, upon my return to \r\nRome, I will enact that measure.\r\ncultivate more than half the food grown in the world, they \r\nrepresent two thirds of the people who live in poverty \r\nand suffer from hunger. More female participation in \r\nthe global economy means more equality and growth.\r\nAs the Secretary-General’s report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/68/1) notes, in the past 13 years \r\ngains have been made in the fight against poverty, \r\nbut despite these tangible improvements one in eight \r\npersons worldwide still suffers from malnutrition. Food \r\nsecurity should be a priority area of action. It combines \r\nthe need to act locally and globally. It incorporates \r\nsome of today’s most crucial issues: a sustainable \r\nrelationship between consumption and production, \r\nenergy efficiency, and more.\r\nItaly is making a specific contribution to the issue \r\nof food security through Expo 2015 in Milan. The theme \r\nis “Feeding the planet: energy for life”. More than 130 \r\ncountries have so far agreed to participate. Italy will \r\nuse Expo Milan as an opportunity to exchange best \r\npractices on global sustainability in the area of food \r\nsecurity and nutrition. We intend to promote new \r\npartnerships between the private and public sectors. As \r\nI underlined to the heads of the United Nations agencies \r\nbased in Rome at a recent meeting, Italy feels that the \r\ntime has come to launch a new global initiative on \r\nfood. The United Nations participation in Expo 2015 \r\nis consequently of great importance. An integrated \r\napproach to development also involves a focus on its \r\nsocial dimensions.\r\nThe projected rise of the world population highlights \r\none of the most serious problems today. I am referring \r\nto global unemployment, particularly among young \r\npeople. This phenomenon affects every part of the world, \r\nincluding Europe and my country. We want to combine \r\nthe measures taken at the national and European levels \r\nto launch our war against unemployment.\r\nItaly deems it important to focus on small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), a true driver for \r\nemployment. Such enterprises are well placed to create \r\njobs for young people and contribute to social stability. \r\nIn Europe, 85 per cent of new jobs in the private sector \r\nare created by SMEs. In the employment sector, great \r\nattention must also be given to people with disabilities.\r\nHundreds of millions of people around the world \r\nbecome immigrants in a phenomenon that affects \r\nboth developed nations and countries of origin. Italy’s \r\ngeographic location makes it a port of entry for thousands \r\nof immigrants. At the national level, we respect the \r\n13-48557 41/42\r\n25/09/2013 A/68/PV.8\r\nactions and our thoughts must focus on the categories \r\nmost at risk: women, children, religious and ethnic \r\nminorities, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \r\npersons, human rights defenders and humanitarian \r\nworkers.\r\nThe recent atrocities in Pakistan once again \r\nillustrate the importance of the issue of religious \r\ntolerance. The General Assembly should never stop \r\nacting to counter religious hatred and fundamentalism.\r\nAt the same time, Italy will continue to support \r\nthe campaign for a worldwide moratorium on the death \r\npenalty.\r\nIn the second half of 2014, Italy will assume the \r\npresidency of the European Union (EU). We want the \r\nEU to be more open to the world. That means more \r\nEuropean foreign, or rather global, policy. It also means \r\nmore trade exchanges with the rest of the world. In that \r\nconnection, we will host the next summit of the Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting, in Milan in October 2014.\r\nI am convinced that a well-governed Europe \r\ncan act as a global player. A good example is the EU \r\nenlargement policy, which succeeded in bringing \r\nstability to the Balkans in a very short time. It is high \r\ntime for the EU to rise again to assume a leading role \r\non the world stage. We in Europe must act now for more \r\nunity and for more effective governance.\r\nOn the theme of adapting to a changing world, allow \r\nme to conclude by referring to reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. As a leading member of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group, Italy strongly believes that Security \r\nCouncil reform is absolutely necessary. The adoption of \r\nany such reform, however, will require the consensus of \r\na large majority of the membership. We need to update \r\nthe Security Council to today’s world, increasing its \r\naccountability, transparency and effectiveness. To \r\nbridge the gap between the different models of reform, \r\nall Member States should be ready to engage in the next \r\nround of negotiations with a higher degree of f lexibility \r\nand openness to compromise.\r\nWe have many challenges ahead. Italy will \r\ncontribute to addressing those challenges as an active \r\nmember of the international community within a \r\nframework of reinforced global governance. We make \r\nthat commitment before the General Assembly, and \r\nwe make that commitment before the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nWe will continue to keep Somalia high on our \r\nagenda. As I confirmed to President Hassan Sheikh \r\nMohamud a few days ago in Rome, Italy is willing to \r\nhelp the Somali authorities in their efforts to lay the \r\nfoundations of an effective and united federal State.\r\nTogether with Ethiopia, Italy has convened a ministerial \r\nmeeting of the Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment Partners Forum tomorrow, 26 September, \r\nhere in New York, to discuss Somalia.\r\nAs the top contributor to Libya, Italy is supporting \r\nthe country in its stabilization and democratic transition, \r\nand we remain fully committed to cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL). \r\nBefore the end of the year, Italy will host the second \r\ninternational conference on Libya in Rome, which we \r\nare preparing together with the Libyan authorities, \r\nUNSMIL and other partners.\r\nItaly reiterates its strong commitment to the \r\nstabilization of Mali and the Sahel region. At the \r\nnational level, we are currently funding training for \r\nborder police in Mali and the Niger. We welcome the \r\nholding of the next high-level meeting on the Sahel. \r\nThe strategy presented by the Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General, Romano Prodi, is a good example \r\nof increasing efforts and resources.\r\nItaly is the seventh-largest contributor to the general \r\nbudget of the United Nations. Since 2006, despite \r\nfinancial constraints, we have been the top contributor \r\nof United Nations peacekeepers among Western \r\ncountries. We are demonstrating our commitment \r\nto peace and stability through our participation in \r\n10 different United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nworldwide, from the Mediterranean and the Middle \r\nEast to Africa and Afghanistan.\r\nItaly is engaged in international initiatives \r\nrelated to peace and security, such as the Arms Trade \r\nTreaty, which we have already ratified. Other relevant \r\ninitiatives include the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime.\r\nItaly believes that respect for human rights is \r\nfundamental to peaceful coexistence among nations. \r\nOur foreign policy will continue to focus on social \r\nand humanitarian affairs and the protection of human \r\nrights. Wherever human rights are at risk, global peace \r\nand security are also at risk.\r\nItaly will continue its efforts to better defend those \r\nmost vulnerable to violence and discrimination. Our \r\n42/42 13-48557\r\nA/68/PV.8 25/09/2013\r\nMr. Enrico Letta, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Council \r\nof Ministers of the Republic of Italy for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\n"
