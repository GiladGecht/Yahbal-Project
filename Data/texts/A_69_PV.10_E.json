Before \r\ngoing further, let me convey our warm felicitations \r\nto you, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. While \r\nwishing you success, I would like to assure you of the \r\nsupport and cooperation of the Gambia during your \r\ntenure as President of the Assembly. I would also like \r\nto commend your predecessor, Mr. John William Ashe, \r\nfor his able stewardship as President of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that injustice, iniquities, \r\nexclusion and greed all contribute to the creation of \r\ninternational tensions that can lead to catastrophic \r\nconsequences, conflicts, wars, death and destruction. \r\nToday we witness lamentable inertia on the part of \r\nthe United Nations, as powerful Member States take \r\nundue advantage of weaker Members; unjust economic \r\nand financial sanctions are imposed on other Member \r\nStates; others are bullied and their natural resources \r\nlooted; or wars are waged against still others, simply \r\nin the name of democracy, freedom and regime change. \r\nAll of those actions are based on false pretences.\r\nThat is not the scenario that the noble and \r\ndistinguished gentlemen, the founders of the United \r\nNations and its Charter, envisaged. What those great \r\nfounding fathers of the United Nations intended over \r\nhalf a century ago was a world body committed to \r\npromoting the principles and ideals of peace and security \r\nand advancing the causes of justice and equality; \r\nfreedom for all; and respect for the sovereignty and \r\nthe territorial integrity of States, rich or poor, black or \r\nwhite, big or small; and respect for the social, spiritual, \r\nreligious and cultural values of all peoples. Therefore, \r\nin order to uphold the founding principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, Member States must avoid the \r\npromotion of all forms of aggression, confrontation \r\nand dangerous tension by exercising maximal restraint \r\nin the pursuit of their individual or collective national \r\ninterests at the expense of others. In fact, the pursuit of \r\none’s interest at the expense of the legitimate interests \r\nand security of others is criminal.\r\nInvariably, when major tensions erupt into conflicts \r\nor wars, the world economy as a whole suffers, with \r\nmajor disruptions or reversals in the developing \r\ncountries. That has been evident in the wake of past \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.10\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n10th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 25 September 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nregional or international conflicts, when oil prices, for \r\nexample, surged, with the developing countries bearing \r\nthe brunt of the debilitating consequences. In short, the \r\nUnited Nations must be seen not as a prejudicial but \r\nrather as an all-embracing global body that stands for \r\nthe interests of not only the few and the powerful but all \r\nits Member States.\r\nThe Gambia acknowledges with satisfaction the \r\noutcome document of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development, entitled “The future we \r\nwant” (resolution 66/288, annex), and the resulting \r\nestablishment of the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and associated consultative \r\nforums, including the African regional consultations \r\non the sustainable development goals. While the \r\nGambia appreciates the proposals of the Open Working \r\nGroup on the post-2015 development framework, it is \r\nhoped that the goals and targets outlined thus far will \r\nref lect an integrated and transformative agenda that \r\nwould ultimately build upon the gains made from the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in order to fully address the many difficult \r\nchallenges that we face today.\r\nIt is in that connection that we welcome the choice \r\nof the theme for this session, namely, “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”. That theme is indeed pertinent and timely, as \r\nit gives fresh impetus to our ardent desire to identify \r\na set of global priorities to steer the international \r\ndevelopment agenda, once the MDGs expire at the \r\nend of 2015. However, in launching that new initiative \r\nfor transformative change, we must not allow novelty \r\nto mask any shortcomings of the MDGs experiment. \r\nThere is a need to take stock of the achievements and \r\nfailures of those Goals and indeed to renew support \r\nto those developing countries, particularly the least \r\ndeveloped, landlocked and island developing countries, \r\nthat may still have difficulties in meeting their critical \r\nMDG targets before the end of 2015.\r\nAt a time when the world is facing multiple and \r\ncomplex challenges, there is a need to pay attention to \r\nthe commanding role that the United Nations should be \r\nplaying in advancing international peace and security, \r\njustice and the fundamental rights and freedoms of all \r\npeoples. The attainment of the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals will be elusive, unless the United \r\nNations begins to execute its core mandate in earnest \r\nand exercises its commanding role in dealing with the \r\nhost of local and international crises that are disruptive \r\nto development. A few current issues stand out on which \r\nthe United Nations has yet to be seen to be playing a \r\nleading role.\r\nFirst, there is Ebola, a deadly haemorrhagic \r\nfever that has claimed more than 2,000 lives in West \r\nAfrica, mostly in the severely affected countries of \r\nthe Republics of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. \r\nThe World Health Organization has warned that, if no \r\nmajor efforts are made immediately, more lives will be \r\nlost and the economies of those countries will come \r\nunder serious strain. Already, the World Bank and \r\nthe International Monetary Fund have projected that, \r\nowing to disruptions in the labour force and productive \r\nsectors of the economies of those countries, declines \r\nin their respective economic growths could range \r\nfrom 1.5 to 3.5 percentage points, if current conditions \r\nremain unchecked.\r\nFor those affected countries, all development \r\nefforts are now on hold as they grapple with that \r\ncontagious and deadly disease. It is encouraging that \r\nthe United States Government has committed, rather \r\nbelatedly, some funds and military assets to curb the \r\nspread of that disease. That gesture is more than just \r\nhumanitarian aid. It is also, as President Obama said, \r\nin the national security interest of the United States. \r\nThat is true because in a globalized, interconnected \r\nworld, infectious diseases can easily spread to any part \r\nof the world. It is for that reason that the United Nations \r\nshould take the lead in mobilizing international support \r\nto fight Ebola, which is an evident danger not only to \r\nWest Africa but to the world at large. On that note, we \r\nwant to thank the Russian Federation for being one of \r\nthe first major Powers to respond to the outbreak of \r\ndeadly Ebola by providing scientific and medical teams \r\nto some of those countries as soon as the outbreak was \r\nannounced.\r\nSecondly, for some time now, the world has been \r\nwitnessing the bloodiest and most heinous form of \r\nterrorism, unleashed by satanic and sadistic human \r\nvermin disguised as Islamic militants, who are acting \r\nostensibly in the name of Islamic purity. In reality, \r\nthose sons of infamy and their shameless and deceitful \r\nclaims of devotion to the peaceful and noble religion of \r\nIslam are, in fact, an insult not only to all true Muslims, \r\nbut to our Prophet and humankind in general.\r\nBefore the emergence of the mujahideen in Iran and \r\nlater in Afghanistan in the 1980s, which was a movement \r\nsubsequently associated with Islamic terrorism by \r\nthe Western mainstream media in total disregard for \r\n14-54847 3/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nits creation and sponsorship by the Western Powers \r\nto fight proxy wars against the Islamic revolution in \r\nIran and the Soviets in Afghanistan, there existed no \r\nIslamic terrorism. Islam in its entire history has never \r\nbeen associated with violence or terrorism, as those \r\nactivities are haram, or forbidden, for a Muslim. Islam \r\nis a religion of peace and tolerance and has nothing to \r\ndo with the activities of those anti-Islamic bands of \r\ndangerous criminals, who spread nothing but deep-\r\nseated hatred for human life and whose sole intention is \r\nto desecrate and defame Islam.\r\nConsequently, those various treacherous hate \r\ngroups cannot be associated with Islam, as our Islamic \r\nreligion is pure and unique and cannot therefore be \r\nclassified into varying degrees such as moderate Islam, \r\ndemocratic Islam, extreme Islam or violent Islam. \r\nSimply put, Islam is a pure religion that encourages \r\nthe best of human behaviour and interpersonal \r\nrelationships, among other virtues, as prescribed \r\nby Allah, the almighty creator. In other words, the \r\nadherents of those lunatic fringe groups of bandits \r\nand gangsters, such as Boko Haram, the Islamic State \r\nin Syria and Al-Qaida, are dangerous criminals and \r\nenemies of human civilization and development and \r\nshould therefore be wiped off the face of the Earth, \r\nbecause we do not need them.\r\nThirdly, the situation in the Middle East remains \r\nhighly volatile, and the United Nations has been \r\nwatching the cycle of violence in the region rather \r\nhelplessly. In the most recent conflict between the \r\nPalestinians and Israelis, approximately 2,000 people \r\nfrom Gaza, mostly women and children, died at the \r\nhands of the Israeli army, and approximately 70 Israelis, \r\nall of them soldiers except for three children, lost their \r\nlives. The continuing expansion of Israeli settlements \r\non Palestinian land, despite repeated calls for restraint \r\nby the international community, is unacceptable, as it \r\nundermines any prospects for a two-State solution. The \r\nUnited States Government has played a very strategic \r\nand useful mediating role in the past, but the United \r\nNations must now take up its commanding role in \r\nseeking a peaceful settlement that is just, durable and \r\nacceptable to all the Members of the United Nations.\r\nFourthly, as part of its core mandate in promoting \r\nglobal peace and security and greater understanding \r\namong peoples of different backgrounds and cultures, \r\nthe United Nations must do more to advocate a culture \r\nof peace, tolerance and understanding, not only among \r\nthe world’s great religions but also among Member \r\nStates themselves. That is important, as we continue to \r\nwitness a growing propagation of disinformation and \r\nmisrepresentation, especially by the Western media, \r\nabout Islam in general and the application of sharia law, \r\nparticularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi \r\nArabia is the birthplace of Islam, and sharia is the \r\nlegal system in Islam and the only divine Constitution \r\nfor not only the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but all \r\nIslamic States. Therefore, the incessant criticisms and \r\nmisrepresentations of the application of sharia law in \r\nSaudi Arabia or anywhere else are disrespectful and \r\nabhorrent. It is an insult to all true Muslims to describe \r\nsharia law as barbaric. As a matter of fact, the most \r\nbarbaric laws are those that are not based on any divine \r\nteachings. Sharia is the legal system that the almighty \r\nAllah has prescribed for all Muslims, and we will apply \r\nit to the letter.\r\nIn the same vein, the General Assembly should be \r\ncommended for the designation, two years ago, of World \r\nInterfaith Harmony Week. It urged Member States to \r\ndesignate the first week of February each year as World \r\nInterfaith Harmony Week, when messages of goodwill \r\nand tolerance are spread through mosques, churches \r\nand other places of worship. While that was a good \r\nbeginning for promoting peace and harmony among \r\nreligions and peoples of different belief systems, the \r\nUnited Nations must do more to counter the continuing \r\nattacks on Islam, in particular by people who do not \r\neven believe in the existence of a supreme creator \r\ncalled Allah. Those infidels have no moral high ground \r\nto describe any religion — because they do not believe \r\nin God, and religion belongs to God — much less say \r\nanything about a religion as pure, authentic and noble \r\nas Islam.\r\nFinally, the United Nations must play its central \r\nrole in addressing the injustices associated with the \r\nunilateral or bilateral application of economic and \r\nfinancial sanctions by one Member State against \r\nanother as a coercive tool of foreign policy, because that \r\ncontravenes the fundamental principles of international \r\nlaw, international humanitarian law and the principles \r\nand norms governing peaceful coexistence among \r\nsovereign States. In that regard, the Gambia calls on \r\nthe United States Government to unconditionally end \r\nthe long-standing United States embargo on Cuba, \r\nwhich has brought about untold hardship for the Cuban \r\npeople. Is it not ironic that the Power talking today \r\nabout respecting Ukrainian sovereignty and freedom \r\nto choose their own way of life is the same Power that \r\nhas maintained a system of unjustifiable collective \r\n4/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\npunishment against the Cuban people for almost five \r\ndecades, thereby devastating their economy, simply \r\nbecause, just as the Ukrainians today, Cubans decades \r\nago opted for a system of governance of their choice?\r\nThat brings me to the subject of climate change. \r\nClimate change and development are inextricably linked. \r\nThe impact of climate change is felt in all countries, \r\nparticularly developing countries, as it undermines \r\ntheir ability to achieve sustainable development. While \r\nAfrica is not responsible for the pollution and the other \r\nfactors causing climate change, it stands to suffer the \r\nmost. With 96 per cent of Africa’s agriculture being \r\ndependent on rainfall and 50 per cent of the fisheries-\r\nrelated jobs estimated to be lost by 2050, climate change \r\nposes dire consequences for livelihoods in Africa. The \r\nGambia firmly believes that mitigating the adverse \r\neffects of climate change requires a timely and decisive \r\nglobal response. It is a challenge that should unite us, \r\nnot divide us. In that regard, the Gambia joins other \r\ncountries affected by climate change and like-minded \r\ngroups in urging the developed countries that are \r\nparties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change to fully implement their commitments \r\nunder the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nIn 1974, the Assembly adopted the Declaration on \r\nthe Establishment of a New International Economic \r\nOrder (resolution 3201 (S-VI)), which was designed \r\nto address some legitimate concerns of developing \r\ncountries, such as improving their terms of trade \r\nand other issues relating to the promotion of a more \r\nequitable international economic system. Many of \r\nthe political, economic and social issues that inspired \r\nthe new international economic order still remain \r\nunresolved, four decades after that historic declaration. \r\nAs the post-2015 agenda attracts our attention today, \r\nwe must not relegate those old concerns of developing \r\ncountries to the dustbin of history. In a nutshell, their \r\nold concerns, as well as their new aspirations, must \r\nno longer be set aside. To that end, the foundation of \r\nany transformative agenda should logically begin with \r\ngenuine reform of the global governance institutions, \r\nparticularly the United Nations system.\r\nGiven the current membership of the Security \r\nCouncil, the reform of that important organ of the \r\nworld body is long overdue. We African leaders have \r\nfor a very long time been calling attention to the need \r\nto restore the effectiveness and legitimacy of the United \r\nNations by allocating two permanent Seats with full \r\nveto powers, as well as two non-permanent seats on \r\nthe Security Council to reflect current geopolitical \r\nrealities.\r\nIf the demands for the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in the interest of equity and justice cannot be \r\naccommodated, then concrete action must be taken for \r\nthe General Assembly to assume all the powers of the \r\nSecurity Council and its responsibilities, including the \r\npower to impose sanctions. Under such an arrangement, \r\nall decisions of the General Assembly would have to be \r\nvoted for by all Members and endorsed by the majority \r\nof its membership, thus ensuring a more democratic \r\nand transparent global body called the United Nations.\r\nOn a final note, I want to call the attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to the very \r\nfrequent and mysterious sinking and capsizing of boats \r\ncarrying mostly black African migrants looking for \r\ngreener pastures in the West, only to end up in body \r\nbags on European shores. Strangely enough, those \r\ncountries, which pretend to love Africans so much \r\nthat they are always preaching to African leaders \r\nabout good governance, the rule of law and respect \r\nfor human life and rights, have been eerily quiet about \r\nthe very dangerous, racist and inhuman behaviour of \r\ndeliberately causing boats carrying black Africans to \r\nsink, selecting only a few lucky ones to be rescued \r\nand sent to concentration camps, called asylum-seeker \r\ncamps. Those camps are as bad as Nazi concentration \r\ncamps, and nobody, no country or human rights \r\ninstitution in the West has ever raised the alarm to that \r\nsort of genocide in the twenty-first century.\r\nIf earlier Africans who received the European \r\nexplorers before colonialism had treated them the \r\nsame way, Africa would not have been colonized for \r\n400 years. The European explorers were nothing short \r\nof people seeking greener pastures for their fellow \r\nEuropeans, as Europe had, at the time, turned into \r\nbrown pastures. After 400 years of colonial looting and \r\nmisrule in Africa, Africa today is reduced from green \r\nto brown pastures, owing to overgrazing. Now African \r\nexplorers are not only unwelcome, but are greeted with \r\ninstant death on European soil. That is unacceptable.\r\nThe United Nations must therefore conduct a \r\nfull and impartial investigation into that man-made \r\ncatastrophe, namely, the sinking or capsizing of boats \r\ncarrying young Africans to Europe. If those boats are \r\nable to cross the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean \r\nSea, only to sink on European coasts, we must find out \r\nwhat deadly mysterious force exists on the European \r\nMediterranean coasts that causes boats carrying young \r\n14-54847 5/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nAfricans to disintegrate and sink upon arrival. Racism, \r\ngreed and hatred can only breed hatred, violence and \r\ndisastrous confrontation between races. We African \r\nleaders should stand up together, I hope, to protect those \r\nyoung Africans from mass murder on European coasts. \r\nI hereby call on the United Nations to commission such \r\nan investigation as a matter of priority and urgency in \r\norder to avert a major racial confrontation. We have the \r\nright as Africans to defend our black people, wherever \r\nthey are. As we welcomed all races to Africa, we will \r\nnot accept that Africans should be treated like dogs, \r\nwith impunity. That is unacceptable. If the United \r\nNations fails to take action, we will take action. And \r\nthe action we take will be determined by us.\r\nIn the Gambia we do not attack people because \r\nthey are white or black, or because of their religion. \r\nNo foreigner in the Gambia would say, “I was attacked \r\nbecause I am a foreigner”. If a foreigner comes into \r\ncontact with the police, it is because he has committed \r\nan offence for which even a Gambian would be \r\narrested. If we cannot tolerate each other, the world will \r\nnever see peace, because nobody can stop migration. \r\nThe Almighty Allah created this world for us to move \r\naround, the same way Europeans moved around when \r\nEurope was bankrupt. Europeans came to Africa for \r\n400 years. We never killed them. They overstayed, and \r\nsome of us had to fight to get them out. Now they have \r\novergrazed our land. We also want greener pastures, but \r\nEuropeans cannot accept us. Let them send Africans \r\nback, but do not kill them. Europeans have no right to \r\nkill them.\r\nOut of the hundreds of European explorers who \r\ncame to the Gambia in those days, only one European \r\ndied on the River Gambia over a span of 400 years. \r\nToday, over a span of five years, more than 500 \r\nGambians have lost their lives on European coasts. \r\nThat is unacceptable. Enough is enough, and the United \r\nNations must intervene, and intervene quickly, or else \r\nwe will all live to regret our failure to take appropriate \r\naction at the right time.\r\nGeopolitical realities have changed. Let the West \r\naccept that, and with us endeavour to change along \r\nwith those realities, as we move together towards \r\nthe peaceful, brighter future we want. The so-called \r\nmilitary super-Powers must know that humankind \r\nwould be sent back to a pre-Stone Age should they be \r\nreckless enough to unleash World War III.\r\nWe cannot have our cake, eat it as we please, and \r\nat the same time dictate to others how, when and where \r\nthey should eat theirs. In the twenty-first century, \r\nhumankind has a need only for super-Powers of peace \r\nand development, not for mediaeval European-style \r\nwarmongers. Why can we not accept the diversity of \r\nthe human race and its attendant diversity in cultures, \r\nreligions and ways of life as each of its diverse groups \r\ndeems fit?\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of the \r\nGambia for the statement he has just made.\r\nAl Hadji Yahya Jammeh, President of the Republic \r\nof the Gambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bronisław Komorowski, President \r\nof the Republic of Poland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of \r\nthe Republic of Poland, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Komorowski (spoke in Polish; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I would first like \r\nto congratulate Mr. Kutesa on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession.\r\nIn the opening sentences of our Charter, we read \r\nthat the United Nations was set up to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to reaffirm \r\nfaith in fundamental human rights and in the equal \r\nrights of nations large and small. In the year marking \r\nthe 100th anniversary of the start of the First World \r\nWar and the seventy-fifth of the start of the Second \r\nWorld War, those words hold a particular resonance for \r\nus — for Poles, Europeans and every society affected \r\nby those tragedies. Both wars were waged partly on \r\nPolish territory; the second began with Nazi Germany’s \r\naggression in collaboration with the Soviet Union. Our \r\npast compels us to reflect on the Charter’s words and \r\nthose events of twentieth-century history, which form \r\nthe backdrop to our decision-making at the national \r\n6/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nlevel, and similarly bind together the entire international \r\ncommunity gathered here at the United Nations.\r\nOne result of the First World War was to foster the \r\ndream of a world without war. That belief and general \r\ndesire bore fruit in the League of Nations, the first \r\ncollective security system in history. It included all \r\nthe factors needed to make a positive mark on history \r\nand to maintain peace and security. It functioned on \r\na foundation of important rules that prohibited war \r\nand encouraged the peaceful settlement of disputes. It \r\nhad shared bodies, disarmament conferences and an \r\ninternational judiciary.\r\nDespite all those institutions, however, we were \r\nunable to make a world without wars. The League \r\neventually became an easy target, if not an object of \r\nridicule. Yet it was not the League itself that failed. It \r\nwas failed by its members, and chiefly by the Powers \r\nthat had been entrusted with special responsibility for \r\nimplementing its principal task. They failed their test in \r\nthe face of the expansion of totalitarian regimes on both \r\nthe left and the right. The emergence of communism, \r\nnational socialism and many militaristic dictatorships \r\nwas in part due to the First World War. Those systems \r\nfed on conflict, because ideological war and war against \r\nother peoples — against other men — were part of their \r\nidentity.\r\nThose threats could have been resisted in time, \r\nbut the democratic world failed, choosing a short-\r\nsighted policy of appeasement and the satisfaction of \r\ndictatorships’ appetites at the expense of weaker States. \r\nThe price paid for that negligence was the Second World \r\nWar, and the whole of humankind had to pay a price \r\nthat would once have been unimaginable. It is from \r\nthe horrible experience of that war, of the Holocaust, \r\nthat the legal notion of genocide stems. Its originator \r\nand the author of the Convention on the Prevention \r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was a Polish \r\nlawyer, Raphael Lemkin, who understood the criminal \r\nnature of both kinds of totalitarianism even before the \r\nwar.\r\nAfter the hecatombs of the war, the international \r\ncommunity decided once again to build a system of \r\ncollective security. I am glad that next year we will be \r\ncelebrating the seventieth anniversary of the foundation \r\nof the United Nations. There are very few now who \r\nremember the world without our Organization, and \r\nit would be difficult to imagine the world without \r\nits activity. During the nearly seven decades of its \r\nexistence, the United Nations has had a track record of \r\namazing achievements, but also many failures.\r\nToday, however, the situation is especially \r\nworrying, as symptoms of the problems that once \r\nbrought down the League of Nations are reappearing. \r\nWe are witnessing a rebirth of the super-Power, a return \r\nto the thinking that divided the world into categories \r\nof geopolitical zones of influence and that has already \r\nled the international community into a morass of \r\nhatred, confrontation and conflict. The United Nations \r\nshould remain vigilant in the face of a return to such \r\nattitudes— it should tolerate no departure from the \r\nprinciples of security and international relations laid \r\ndown in the Charter. Tolerance of such attitudes always \r\nends badly and not infrequently leads to catastrophe.\r\nWe cannot overemphasize that the occupation \r\nof Crimea and the aggression in Ukraine violate \r\nthe standards of international law and trample on \r\nthe fundamental values of the United Nations. The \r\nideological background of the conflict is a return to \r\nthe rhetoric of the first half of the twentieth century, \r\na return to the logic of zones of influence, of might is \r\nright, and of ruthless imperial domination of weaker \r\nneighbours, which are apparently obliged to be obedient \r\nsatellites of a Power redesigning the foundations of the \r\ncivilized international order.\r\nThe Security Council, the organ responsible \r\nfor peace, proved to be ineffective when faced with \r\nconflicts in Ukraine and other regions of the world, \r\npartly due to its rules of operation. We are threatened \r\nby a further descent into powerlessness if such rules are \r\nnot amended. It is salutary that the General Assembly \r\nrose to the challenge when, in resolution 68/262, of \r\n27 March 2014, it took the side of the weaker party that \r\nwas being targeted in an act of imperial aggression.\r\nI feel all the more sad and concerned uttering \r\nthe foregoing words, since we are celebrating the \r\njoyful twenty-fifth anniversary of the abolishment \r\nof communism and the collapse of the Soviet bloc \r\nin Poland, which is also being celebrated in other \r\ncountries of the region. That “spring of nations”, the \r\nsecond in the history of Europe, brought freedom to \r\nthe nations of Central and Eastern Europe and respect \r\nfor human rights and good democratic governance. At \r\nthe time, changes for the better took place throughout \r\nEurope, and even worldwide. The Iron Curtain fell and \r\nso did the bipolar division of the world. The Cold War \r\nconfrontation and its accompanying threats of nuclear \r\nconflict became things of the past.\r\n14-54847 7/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nThat historical change began in Poland with the \r\nestablishment of the 10 million-strong Solidarity \r\nmovement, a peaceful opposition movement against \r\ntotalitarian oppression and the violation of nations’ \r\nrights. The victorious parliamentary elections of 4 June \r\nbrought about the formation, on 12 September 1989, \r\nof the first non-Communist Government in our part of \r\nEurope since the Second World War, the Government of \r\nTadeusz Mazowiecki.\r\nJust two weeks later, on 25 September, precisely \r\n25 years ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs in that \r\nnew Government, Professor Krzysztof Skubiszewski, \r\naddressed the Assembly from this very rostrum (see \r\nA/44/PV.4) and proclaimed that the new Poland would \r\nnot respect the logic of zones of influence. He further \r\nrevealed that we would respect existing treaties and \r\nobligations, as well as the security interests of other \r\nStates, and none of that would result in any limitations \r\nwith respect to choosing or changing the system of \r\npolity.\r\nThat new logic of international relations has \r\nbeen most beneficial for Europe, where a great wave \r\nof unification has been set in motion thanks to the \r\nstrengthening of the mechanisms of integration of the \r\nEuropean Community and its expansion to include \r\nmany new States. In our region, the European Union \r\nis a synonym for peace. It was established so that \r\nthere would be no more wars on a continent that had \r\npreviously been notorious for them. And indeed, the \r\nEuropean Union has become a significant force for \r\npeace in Europe and far beyond its borders, to which \r\nPoland has contributed in a highly active way.\r\nWe had the right to hope that the benefits of the end \r\nof divisions in Europe and of the logic of imperial zones \r\nof influence would be shared by a growing number of \r\nStates and nations — and not only in Europe — and that \r\nthey would be able to decide their fate democratically \r\nand build their lives in peace and prosperity, free from \r\nexternal domination. We have hoped and continue to \r\nhope for a democratic modernization of Russia. But \r\nwhat happened six months ago in Eastern Europe \r\ndealt a blow to that hope and threatened security \r\non our European continent. In our part of Europe, \r\npeople are again asking themselves whether war as a \r\nmethod of obtaining a political goal will also be the \r\nlong-term European reality. We cannot acquiesce to \r\nthe brutalization of international life anywhere in the \r\nworld — far less so in Europe, where the wounds of two \r\nWorld Wars are still healing.\r\nYet wars and conflicts are also continuing in other \r\nparts of our globe and are creating countless victims, \r\nsuffering and destruction. We have all been surprised \r\nby the rapid development of the so-called Islamic \r\nState of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The brutality of \r\nthe actions of its fighters, who are murdering and \r\npersecuting people of every faith, including those who \r\nprofess Islam, must inspire terror and trigger a response \r\nfrom the international community. ISIL’s barbarism is a \r\nchallenge for all of humankind, irrespective of religion, \r\nethnic origin or political viewpoint. We, the States \r\nfaithful to the United Nations Charter, cannot shirk our \r\nresponsibility for providing security. We are responsible \r\nfor protecting those threatened by cruel violence. Yet \r\neverything must be done to ensure that the actions we \r\ntake do not contravene the United Nations Charter.\r\nWe express our concern and sympathy for the \r\ncivilian victims of the conflicts and tragedies in Syria, \r\nLibya, Israel, the Gaza Strip and many African States. \r\nAll those conflicts, and to an even greater degree the \r\ncivil wars in some African countries, are accompanied \r\nby humanitarian catastrophes. The United Nations, \r\nand especially the super-Powers that can influence \r\nthe participating parties, should do everything to stop \r\nthem.\r\nNobody could ever take the place of the United \r\nNations and its agencies in providing aid to refugees \r\nand other victims of humanitarian tragedies. On \r\nbehalf of Poland, I hereby express appreciation for \r\nthem. and recognition for the thousands of courageous \r\nmembers of humanitarian organizations, United \r\nNations agencies and non-governmental organizations \r\nwho, amid all the dangers and frequently at the cost of \r\ntheir own lives, hurry to the aid of those who suffer \r\npersecution. They help those whose security and health \r\nis threatened — those left alone, without a roof over \r\ntheir heads, who are far away from homes to which, \r\ndue to destruction, many will never be able to return. \r\nAn ever-increasing number of people are experiencing \r\nsuffering and cruelty linked to military conflicts. \r\nThat horrifying trend must be stopped by our common \r\nefforts.\r\nThe fact that, in so many places, we are witnessing \r\nconflicts that entail human tragedy and the deaths \r\nof thousands of people is due, as a general rule, to a \r\nfailure to observe fundamental human rights. Entire \r\ncommunities and nations are denied influence over \r\npolitical decisions. Power without control is, in most \r\ncases, corrupt and self-loving, incapable of lifting \r\n8/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\ncountries out of underdevelopment and poverty. That \r\nis the background to the conflicts and rebellions in \r\nUkraine, Iraq, Libya and many other places in the world. \r\nThat is why we must increase our efforts to help by \r\noffering development assistance to bring about social, \r\neconomic and political transformation. Otherwise, the \r\nonly alternative to dictatorship will be chaos.\r\nPoland is especially attached to the role of \r\ndemocracy in the life of nations, their development \r\nand international activity. We know how much we lost \r\nbecause of the absence of democracy under communism, \r\nand we know how much we gained when we returned to \r\ndemocracy as a means of achieving our civic aspirations \r\nand an expression of our national sovereignty. It was \r\nfor that purpose that a broad international initiative by \r\nthe Community of Democracies was born in Warsaw in \r\n2000. That is precisely why my country established the \r\ninternational Lech Wałęsa Solidarity Award for activity \r\nin support of democracy and fundamental freedoms.\r\nPoland steadfastly believes that sustainable \r\ndevelopment cannot be achieved without the rule of law \r\nand respect for fundamental rights and freedoms for \r\nall. We will strive to attain the appropriate inclusion of \r\nthose questions in the new United Nations development \r\nagenda. Through our experiences over the past few \r\ndecades in our history, we have learned the importance \r\nof solidarity, responsibility and involvement — the \r\ntriad of principles in the United Nations system we are \r\nfaithful to.\r\nWe fully acknowledge the involvement of the \r\nUnited Nations in the improvement of the social and \r\neconomic situation in those regions of the world where \r\nconditions are the most difficult. Poland actively \r\nparticipates in the definition of the priorities and means \r\nof implementation of the new development agenda that \r\nwill replace the Millennium Development Goals of \r\n2000, and we will purposefully participate in making \r\nit a reality. The new development agenda should fully \r\nand coherently integrate the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development, \r\nwhile at the same time focusing on the reduction of \r\npoverty and protection of the natural environment.\r\nReaching an international understanding on that \r\nmatter is a task that is as ambitious as it is difficult — yet \r\nit is necessary and feasible. The output of the previous \r\nAssembly session, worked on by the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals under \r\nthe highly efficient co-chairmanship of Kenya and \r\nHungary, defines the course of further discussion on \r\nthe matter. Poland will continue its active involvement \r\nin a dialogue that should bring about the development of \r\na new, ambitious and universal post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nIt is vitally important to halt any further global \r\nclimate change caused by the development of human \r\ncivilization and to adjust to the changes that are already \r\nirreversible. Here lurk existential issues pertaining \r\nto security, the problems of economic development, \r\nthe maintenance of biological diversity in the Earth’s \r\necosystem and quality of life. In its capacity as host \r\nof the United Nations Climate Change Conference held \r\nin Warsaw in November 2013, and as we still hold the \r\npresidency of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nPoland remains committed to achieving a successful \r\nconclusion to the negotiations. We believe that it is \r\npossible to achieve an understanding in a manner \r\nthat is fair to countries at various levels of economic \r\ndevelopment. Agreement is possible, and I hope such \r\nan understanding will be arrived at in the near future. \r\nI would like to reiterate that, despite the hardships and \r\ncosts of economic transformation, Poland has decreased \r\nits greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 30 per \r\ncent since 1988 — that is, it has greatly exceeded the \r\nreduction obligations stipulated in the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nPoland is deeply involved in various fields of \r\nactivity covered by this Organization, ranging from \r\nhuman rights to disarmament. That is why we know \r\nperfectly well that nothing can replace the United \r\nNations system, which is continuously improvable. \r\nPoland is currently assuming an increasing measure \r\nof responsibility for cooperation in development, \r\nhumanitarian aid and climate protection. We are \r\nready to share our experience and our ideas as a \r\nnon-permanent member of the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2018-2019. We intend to support a reform of that \r\nbody that will increase its representative character and, \r\nin parallel, reinforce its efficiency. The reform should \r\nprimarily concern the Council’s mandate in situations \r\ninvolving the principle of the responsibility to protect, \r\nwhich was approved by our community in 2005. The \r\nidea must be to develop a mechanism that will provide \r\nthe Council with the capacity to act in such situations, \r\nwhile at the same time making it impossible to use the \r\nmandate of the Council for purposes other than the \r\ndischarge of that responsibility.\r\n14-54847 9/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nI have raised that idea from this rostrum twice \r\nalready. It should perhaps be combined with a broader \r\nreform of the Council, the outlines of which were given \r\nshape before the historic summit held in 2005. The \r\nsituation is unchanged from nearly 70 years ago — we \r\nwant to save succeeding generations from the scourge \r\nof war and reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights \r\nand the rights of nations, large and small.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Poland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bronisław Komorowski, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Latvia.\r\nMr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Bērziņš: As we enter a crucial session \r\nof the General Assembly, we will define our post-2015 \r\ndirection. Our way ahead must be based on the triangle \r\nof security, development and human rights. If one of \r\nthose elements is not present, the other two will fail.\r\nThis year, we commemorated the grim anniversaries \r\nof the First and Second World Wars. Both wars began \r\nin Europe, but quickly spread throughout the world, \r\ndestroying the lives of countless millions. The League \r\nof Nations and the United Nations were built on the \r\nashes of those wars.\r\nToday again, global security and peace are \r\nchallenged by forces willing to rewrite the history \r\nand rules of the international order. The aggression of \r\nRussia against Ukraine has defied the basic principles \r\nof the United Nations, uprooting the very foundation \r\nof the international system. It has grabbed part of a \r\nsovereign European country, using previously unseen \r\ntactics of warfare and immense propaganda against \r\nits neighbour. It enabled the tragic shooting down of \r\na civilian airplane. It has shown that agreements and \r\ncommitments do not matter, and it wantonly ignores \r\nand manipulates international opinion. Those actions \r\ncannot be qualified otherwise than as a threat to global \r\npeace and security. The world, including the General \r\nAssembly, has supported Ukraine’s territorial integrity. \r\nThe illegal annexation of Crimea and Sebastopol by \r\nRussia has been condemned and will not be recognized \r\nby the international community.\r\nRussia has a vital role to play in security and stability \r\nin Europe and should be part of the solution — not part \r\nof the problem. Latvia hopes that the ceasefire agreed \r\nto on 5 September will be implemented in a sustainable \r\nmanner. Latvia therefore calls on Russia to immediately \r\nwithdraw its armed forces from Ukrainian territory and \r\nstop sending weapons and mercenaries to the terrorist \r\ngroups. We call upon Russia to return to respecting its \r\ninternational commitments and upholding international \r\nlaw.\r\nSeventy-five years ago, the decay of the \r\ninternational system proved fatal to the Baltic States. \r\nTwo totalitarian regimes — one under Hitler and the \r\nother under Stalin — divided Europe, and we lost our \r\nfreedom for 50 long years. Twenty-five years ago, more \r\nthan 2 million people joined hands and formed a human \r\nchain across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic \r\nway clearly illustrated the people’s demand for freedom \r\nand restoration of their statehood. The Baltic people \r\nmade their choice. The Ukrainian people have the same \r\nright to choose their own democratic path, human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms.\r\nLatvia supports the complementarity of efforts \r\namong international organizations at both the global and \r\nregional levels to use all instruments at their disposal to \r\nprevent the emergence of a frozen conflict in the eastern \r\nregion of Ukraine; to help and support Ukraine; to \r\nuphold agreements and commitments and demand their \r\nfulfilment by all parties, including Russia; to maintain \r\nunity and reject attempts to divide Ukraine by reviving \r\nspheres of influence and establishing hidden support to \r\nterrorists as part of the new norms of Europe.\r\nThere is no alternative to an international order \r\nbased on the rule of law, democracy and respect \r\nfor human rights and providing the foundation for \r\nlong-term peace and security. The resolution of the \r\nprotracted conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South \r\nOssetia and Nagorno Karabakh should remain high on \r\nthe international agenda.\r\n10/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nIn addition, the security situation in the wider \r\nMiddle East is very fragile. A solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict is paramount in order to establish \r\nlasting stability in the region. Following the escalation of \r\nviolence in recent months, the international community, \r\nincluding Latvia, has helped to address the emergency \r\nhumanitarian needs of the people of Gaza. We hope \r\nthat the current ceasefire will be fully respected by \r\nboth sides. However, only an agreement on a two-State \r\nsolution, achieved through direct negotiations, will \r\naccomplish those goals.\r\nWe welcome the elimination of Syria’s chemical \r\nweapons and related materials. While easing the \r\ncontinuing human suffering of Syrians is the immediate \r\ngoal, the international community must continue \r\npolitical efforts to find a solution to that horrific \r\nconflict. Those responsible for war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity in Syria must be held accountable by \r\nthe International Criminal Court.\r\nThe limited ability of the Security Council to \r\naddress the urgent situations in Syria and Ukraine in \r\na timely manner underlines the need to move forward \r\nwith reform of the Council. Latvia supports the \r\nexpansion of the Security Council in both categories \r\nof membership. At the same time, the French initiative, \r\naimed at restricting the use of the veto, merits our joint \r\nattention.\r\nThe completion of the International Security \r\nAssistance Force mission in Afghanistan this year \r\nwill be an important step towards assumption by the \r\npeople of full responsibility for peace and stability \r\nin the country. Despite all the challenges, the legacy \r\nof the mission is clear. Peace and security have been \r\nstrengthened, including greater respect for human \r\nrights and greater opportunities for the Afghan people \r\nthan ever before.\r\nThe recent presidential elections clearly showed \r\nthe will of the Afghan people to live in a peaceful and \r\ndemocratic society. The people of Afghanistan will \r\nnot be abandoned after 2014. International support \r\nto Afghanistan, including security protection, will \r\nbe continued. I am convinced that cooperation and \r\nconfidence-building between Afghanistan and its \r\nneighbours, including in Central Asia, will be key to \r\nlong-term security solutions in the region.\r\nThe growing negative impact of violent extremist \r\nideologies in Syria, Iraq and other countries is \r\nalarming. Militant fighters of the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Sham (ISIS) have exploited instability in those \r\ncountries and now pose a threat to ethnic and religious \r\ncommunities. In that context, Latvia joined the United \r\nStates in coordinated efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to counter ISIS. We strongly welcome the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on \r\nforeign fighters. Latvia has already begun to prepare \r\nmeasures to prevent the recruitment of and support to \r\nforeign fighters.\r\nLatvia is concerned about the safety of journalists \r\nduring political unrest and conflict. All imprisoned \r\njournalists must be released. Freedom of the media \r\nand free access to information, including online, are \r\nessential components of any democracy.\r\nArmed conflicts in Africa have an impact upon \r\nstability and the sustainable development of the people. \r\nLatvia takes part in peace and security operations \r\nin Mali and the Central African Republic in order to \r\ncontribute to conflict settlement and to improve the \r\nsecurity situation in those regions. Latvia is ready to \r\ncommit itself to strengthening United Nations global \r\npeacekeeping.\r\nLatvia welcomes the ongoing dialogue between \r\nthe E3+3 countries and Iran, which aims to negotiate a \r\ncomprehensive agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme. \r\nThe parties involved, in particular Iran, must make \r\nevery effort to use the extended time frame to find a \r\nsolution. We must work towards revitalizing the global \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation agenda. The success \r\nof the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\ndepends on re-establishing trust and a common purpose \r\namong the States parties. Latvia was one of the first \r\nStates to sign and to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty. We \r\nurge all United Nations Members to do the same.\r\nPeace and security are both enablers of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and objectives in their own right. Without \r\npeaceful societies, we cannot achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Each country has its own responsibility \r\nfor achieving that goal. Our societies need honest \r\nand accountable Governments that protect them from \r\nviolence and crime and ensure fundamental freedoms \r\nand sustainable economic growth.\r\nFourteen years ago, we, the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, made a historic commitment to \r\neradicating extreme poverty and to improving the health \r\nand welfare of the world’s people within 15 years. The \r\nnew development agenda should go further. We must \r\n14-54847 11/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\naddress global challenges, such as conflicts, terrorism, \r\ninequalities, the absence of the rule of law, climate \r\nchange and natural disasters. The social, economic and \r\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainability should be \r\naddressed in a balanced way.\r\nMs. Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his personal \r\nengagement in bringing together representatives of \r\nGovernments, business, industry, finance and civil \r\nsociety to discuss climate change this week. Latvia \r\nsupports the initiatives of the Secretary-General. The \r\npost-2015 agenda must be consistent with all human \r\nrights and be underpinned by the rule of law. It should \r\naddress inequalities and discrimination, including \r\nby means of the advancement of information and \r\ncommunications technology. Those are key enablers \r\nfor all spheres of development. Gender equality is \r\nessential to shaping respectful and equal relationships \r\nin society. Those values are important for Latvia. As \r\nan aspiring member of the Human Rights Council for \r\nthe term 2015-2017, we will continue to promote such \r\nvalues globally. Last but not least, the post-2015 agenda \r\nshould be built on strong accountability mechanisms \r\nand a strengthened global partnership. That requires \r\nthe active engagement of Governments, civil society, \r\nthe private sector and the United Nation system.\r\nIn the first half of 2015, Latvia will assume the \r\npresidency of the Council of the European Union. \r\nEurope needs the world as much as the world needs \r\nEurope. That is why the Latvian presidency will focus \r\non strengthening the European Union’s involvement \r\nglobally. We will actively work to promote Europe’s \r\ncooperation with its neighbours and with the countries \r\nof Central Asia. I affirm my country’s commitment \r\nto actively engaging in efforts to shape our common \r\nfuture.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andris Bērziņš, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Gabonese Republic.\r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, \r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bongo Ondimba (spoke in French): \r\nI would first of all like to extend my sincere \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. I assure him of the full support of my country. \r\nThe remarkable work of his predecessor, Mr. John \r\nWilliam Ashe, during the sixty-eighth session deserves \r\nour recognition. The same goes for the commendable \r\nand tireless efforts of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nas head of the Organization.\r\nAt the previous session, we deplored and condemned \r\nthe cowardly terrorist attacks on the shopping centre in \r\nNairobi. Now, inevitably, the current session takes place \r\nin an equally worrisome context, marked by serious \r\nthreats to international peace and security. First, there \r\nis the advance of the elusive Boko Haram terrorist \r\nnetwork, which is extending its area of influence to \r\nthe border of the neighbouring countries of Gabon, \r\nwreaking havoc and killing without discrimination. \r\nThen, there is the recurrence of the epidemic of the \r\nEbola haemorrhagic fever, with an unprecedented \r\nincidence of infection, which is plunging Africa into \r\nmourning. Allow me to pay tribute to the memory of \r\nthose who have lost their lives trying to help those who \r\nare ill. I also pay solemn tribute to the men and women \r\nwho risk their lives in their daily fight to eradicate the \r\npandemic.\r\nGiven that the threat of Ebola is worldwide, national \r\nresponses should be replaced by a comprehensive \r\nmobilization at the global level. In that regard, my \r\ncountry welcomes the recent steps taken by the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations, as well as the \r\nmany national initiatives that have been announced. \r\nI welcome the United Nations decision to dispatch an \r\nemergency medical mission to fight the Ebola epidemic \r\nin the affected countries. My country, which prevailed \r\nin its fight against several Ebola crises in the past, \r\nintends to make available the International Centre for \r\nMedical Research Centre in Franceville. The Centre’s \r\nexpertise in treating that disease has been proven.\r\n12/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nI am pleased that this session allows us to debate a \r\ntopic that concerns all of us, namely “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”. For Gabon, the report recently adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on sustainable development goals \r\n(A/68/970) is a solid foundation in the development \r\nof that agenda. My country welcomes the fact that \r\nAfrican priorities, including the eradication of extreme \r\npoverty, the promotion of sustainable agriculture and \r\nindustrialization, and the protection of the environment, \r\nall figure prominently in that report.\r\nI would like to recall here that Gabon entered the \r\npost-2015 development agenda process when it began \r\nto implement the Strategic Plan for an Emerging \r\nGabon. The plan is based on a vision, an approach that \r\nhas led us to define a bold development programme. \r\nThat programme, of course, incorporates the concerns \r\nreflected in the Millennium Development Goals, as well \r\nas the challenges of climate change and food security. \r\nIt gives pride of place to everything that promotes the \r\nmaximization of our youth potential. The strategy \r\nimplemented by Gabon aims to accelerate the structural \r\ntransformation of its economy by moving from a rentier \r\neconomy to an economy of industries and services with \r\nhigh added-value in the near future.\r\nIn the current phase of implementing that \r\nprogramme, special attention is being devoted to \r\ncompetitiveness factors, such as the formation of \r\nhuman capital and the construction and upgrading of \r\ndevelopment infrastructure, including the development \r\nof a digital economy and the strengthening of energy-\r\nproduction capacities. Over the short term, we intend to \r\ndevote greater efforts to education and training in order \r\nto improve the performance of our basic education \r\nsystem. The goal here is to enhance the employability \r\nof our workforce, provide a qualified labour force for \r\nour labour market and accelerate the integration of \r\nyoung people into the workforce. The development of \r\nagriculture, livestock, fisheries and aquaculture, as \r\nwell as food security, continues to receive sustained \r\nattention from my Government. Those are all areas \r\nwhere we thought it best to anticipate our leap in the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nIt is common knowledge that all those efforts can \r\ntruly thrive only in a political, economic and social \r\nenvironment marked by good governance. To that end, \r\nGabon has established various institutional instruments, \r\nsuch as the National Commission for the Fight against \r\nIllicit Enrichment, whose overall mission is to ensure \r\ntransparency and accountability in the management of \r\npublic funds. Since then, I have made the fight against \r\ncorruption a priority strategic objective. Right now, \r\nlarge-scale inspection and verification missions are \r\nunder way throughout the country with substantial \r\nresults. I remain firmly convinced that, in order to \r\nestablish a solid foundation for our post-2015 agenda, \r\nwe need to tailor our economic environment, so as \r\nto ensure that transparency guides the awarding of \r\npublic contracts and licenses, that investments produce \r\na good return, and that economic actors respect their \r\nobligations vis-à-vis the State.\r\nGabon’s commitment to the fight against climate \r\nchange remains constant, given the seriousness of \r\nthe problem. Indeed, as has already been pointed out, \r\nthe latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change draws attention to the harsh reality \r\nof the damage caused by climate change. It would be \r\nwrong on our part to remain insensitive in the face of \r\nwhat is transpiring before our very eyes. That is why I \r\nwelcome the commitments made by the heads of State \r\nand Government at the end of the Climate Summit held \r\nhere on 23 September.\r\nI reiterate Gabon’s determination to bear its share \r\nof our common duty. Gabon’s objective is to reduce, \r\nby 2025, more than half the greenhouse gas emissions \r\nper capita produced by every Gabonese. My country \r\nwishes to strengthen its contribution to the efforts of \r\nthe international community aimed at the adoption of a \r\nmore binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. \r\nThat is the purpose of the meeting that we will organize \r\nin Libreville from 18 to 19 March 2015, our “South \r\nClimate Initiative.” As part of that initiative, which will \r\ntake place after the important Lima Conference, we, \r\nthe countries of the South, want to make a structured \r\ncontribution for the success of the Paris Conference. \r\nThe scale of climatic upheavals caused by global \r\nwarming shows that climate change is a vital, even \r\nexistential question. Given the extreme seriousness of \r\nthe danger confronting us, we must unite. We need to \r\nwork hand in hand towards the same goal, namely, to \r\nsave the planet in Paris in December 2015.\r\nIn just one year, our Organization will celebrate its \r\nseventieth anniversary. That maturity should enable it \r\nto better respond to the multifaceted challenges that it \r\nfaces. The effective implementation of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda must also be tackled. That is why \r\nwe must continue our efforts to resolve crises and \r\nhotbeds of tension in various parts of the world.\r\n14-54847 13/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nRegarding the Central African Republic, Gabon \r\ncontinues to actively participate in the efforts of the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States, the \r\nAfrican Union, the United Nations and the rest of the \r\ninternational community in seeking to stabilize the \r\npolitical, security, economic and humanitarian situation \r\non the ground.\r\nIn that connection, I want to pay tribute to the \r\nBrazzaville Forum for National Reconciliation in the \r\nCentral African Republic, which concluded with the \r\nsigning of a ceasefire agreement. Moreover, Gabon \r\nwelcomes the effective establishment of the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in the Central African Republic, which took \r\nover from the African-led International Support \r\nMission to the Central African Republic. Regarding \r\nMali, Gabon supports the peace process that has been \r\nlaunched and supports the mediation efforts by Burkina \r\nFaso, Algeria and Morocco aimed at achieving a lasting \r\npeace. In South Sudan, Gabon supports the efforts \r\nof the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\nand the African Union in the search for a negotiated \r\npolitical solution between the two parties.\r\nRegarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I \r\nwelcome the signing, under Egyptian mediation, of a \r\nceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. My \r\nhope is that that truce lasts and promotes the resumption \r\nof direct negotiations to achieve the widely shared \r\nvision of creating a viable Palestinian State existing in \r\nharmony alongside Israel in peace and security, within \r\nsecure and internationally recognized borders.\r\nRegarding Western Sahara, Gabon welcomes the \r\nefforts based on dialogue and negotiations agreed to \r\nby our Organization. My country wants to reiterate its \r\nsupport for the Moroccan initiative, which we consider \r\nto be a courageous and realistic proposal that could lead \r\nto a lasting settlement. Finally, in terms of the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, Gabon reiterates its position in favour of \r\nlifting it, because of its negative impact on the welfare \r\nof the population.\r\nNever has the terrorist threat been as strong \r\nas in recent times, jeopardizing the survival of the \r\ninstitutions of the countries affected by that terrible \r\nphenomenon. In Africa, Boko Haram’s activism pushes \r\nentire populations to live far from their homes and in \r\nterror, poverty and despair.\r\nIn the Middle East, the so-called Islamic State \r\nhas extended its gruesome reign from eastern Syria \r\nto northern Iraq. Its establishment there has been \r\naccompanied by a lengthy sequence of rape, summary \r\nexecutions, decapitations and punishments of all types \r\ninflicted upon all those who, in the eyes of the extremists, \r\nsymbolize the rejection of their radicalization.\r\nAs no nation is now spared the murderous folly \r\nof those negative entities, the fight against terrorism \r\nneeds to be more concerted and organized. My country \r\nreiterates its support for international efforts undertaken \r\nto that end and reaffirms its firm condemnation of \r\nterrorist acts in all their forms and manifestations. In \r\nseeking to meet the security challenge of terrorism, \r\nwe need to strengthen the operational capacities of \r\nour defence and security forces in conformity with the \r\nspirit of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy.\r\nOur concerns for peace and security are \r\ncompounded by other cross-cutting threats, notably the \r\npoaching of and illicit trafficking in protected species. \r\nThat growing phenomenon, especially in Central \r\nAfrica, constitutes a threat at three levels: ecological, \r\neconomic and security. My country therefore remains \r\nwedded to the London initiative of February 2014. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to opposing poaching and \r\nto implementing a moratorium on the ivory trade. To \r\nthat end, Gabon and Germany will organize tomorrow, \r\n26 September, a side event on the issue.\r\nMy country is more determined than ever to \r\ncooperate further with other States in formulating \r\na development tool that would take into account the \r\nglobal concerns of our populations. That will involve, \r\ninter alia, achieving progress in the reform of the United \r\nNations system. It is from that perspective that Gabon, \r\nlike other States Members of the United Nations, \r\nadheres to the “Delivering as one” initiative. Currently \r\nat the very core of United Nations reform, that approach \r\naims at improving the coherence of the United Nations \r\nsystem’s operational development activities.\r\nRespect for human dignity and for fundamental \r\nfreedoms remains at the heart of my Government’s \r\nconcerns. That factor underpins our chairmanship \r\nof the Human Rights Council, which we are holding \r\nin a very difficult international context marked by \r\nnumerous human rights violations. Despite all those \r\nchallenges, the Council has been able to react and to \r\nrespond with solutions to emergency situations caused \r\nby such violations. Gabon’s leadership has allowed \r\nconstructive debate and has in particular prevented \r\na lapse into politicized and polarized discussions. I \r\n14/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nshould like to reiterate my gratitude to those countries \r\nthat have lent us their support to ensure the success of \r\nour mandate.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I encourage the inclusion of the \r\nhuman rights dimension in the current consideration of \r\nthe post-2015 agenda. Gabon urges such inclusion, and \r\nsuggests that particular emphasis be placed on the link \r\nbetween human rights and sustainable development. \r\nGiven all this, Gabon remains committed to engaging, \r\nalongside other States, in seeking collective solutions \r\nadapted to current challenges in preparation for a better \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPanama.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Juan Carlos Varela \r\nRodríguez, President of the Republic of Panama, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Varela Rodríguez (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I wish to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession.\r\nI am from a region that, in my youth, lived through \r\nchallenging conflicts. That inspired me to go into \r\npublic life, which in turn has allowed me to address \r\nthe General Assembly in my capacity as President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama at a time when the world is \r\nenduring conflicts and very serious situations that call \r\nfor all of us to take action. I am speaking on behalf \r\nof a noble, wholesome and peaceful people, whom I \r\ngreet and warmly embrace from this rostrum. Panama \r\nis a peace-loving country that has granted me the \r\nopportunity to lead a Government that is steering our \r\ncountry to a foreign policy of unity and consensus, \r\nbased on our geographic location and the mandate of \r\nbeing a champion of peace and the common good of all \r\nthe inhabitants of this beautiful planet.\r\nDespite the serious conflicts raging throughout the \r\nworld today, America is at peace. The major challenges \r\nwe face today are inequality, the fight against organized \r\ncrime and drug and human trafficking, and the need \r\nto regulate migration f lowing out of necessity into \r\ncountries with more developed economies. Those \r\nchallenges are being addressed by our Governments, but \r\nthey require further coordination. As leaders, we must \r\nunderstand that in order to achieve and maintain peace \r\nthroughout the world, we must first lead our nations \r\nalong the same path. This is why I am committed to \r\nsocial justice, to strengthening the rule of law, and to \r\nleading an honest, humane Government that is in touch \r\nwith the people and whose strength is based on the \r\nprinciple that public office is solely for the service of \r\nothers, putting our country’s resources at the service of \r\nthe people of Panama, the region and the world.\r\nFourteen years ago, the Heads of State and of \r\nGovernment of the international community gathered \r\nin the General Assembly to approve the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), which defined a global \r\ndevelopment agenda to address various common \r\nchallenges and improve the standards of living of our \r\npeoples. Despite their differences of the time, countries \r\nwere able to agree and to reach a consensus to respect the \r\npriorities of each nation, focusing on the achievement \r\nof fundamental goals aimed at guaranteeing the human \r\npotential of our citizens.\r\nToday, nearly a decade and a half after that \r\nhistoric Declaration, all countries without exception, \r\nthrough different Governments, have made important \r\nprogress in meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Nonetheless, not only have many of \r\nthe challenges defined in the MDGs not been met, \r\nbut new ones have arisen that require us to build a \r\nnew consensus and to establish goals at the regional, \r\nhemispheric and global levels. That is why, on behalf \r\nof the people and the Government of Panama, I would \r\nlike to reiterate our commitment to being a facilitator \r\nof dialogue that allows for bringing the international \r\ncommunity together anew so that we may redefine the \r\npost-2015 global development agenda.\r\nFor the past five centuries, the isthmus of Panama \r\nhas been the transit route of civilizations. Today, our \r\n14-54847 15/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\ncountry is still committed to that role. This year, as we \r\nmark the centennial of the Panama Canal, we reiterate \r\nour commitment to being a nation at the service of the \r\ninternational community, with the Canal, our logistic \r\nsystem, ports, airports and our heartfelt embrace of all \r\ncountries of the world.\r\nAs they do in this building, the United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, all the worlds’ f lags come together \r\nin the Panama Canal, and that is a source of pride \r\nand satisfaction for all Panamanians. It makes us \r\na country of convergence, and we therefore have a \r\ngreat responsibility to the Panamanian people and \r\nthe international community. Furthermore, Panama \r\nhas assumed the challenge of completing the Canal \r\nexpansion project, which we will do with firmness, \r\ndetermination and the support of professionals and \r\nworkers from Panama and various other nations.\r\nPanamanians feel a great responsibility to \r\ncontributing to the search for understanding in order to \r\nmaintain social peace, promote international security \r\nand join efforts towards the solution of common \r\nproblems that affect us. That is why we reaffirm today \r\nour vocation as a country of dialogue, ready to fulfil the \r\nresponsibility of uniting the Americas and the world \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations and in every \r\nopportunity we have to mediate in disputes that hinder \r\nus from reaching agreements towards tackling the new \r\nglobal challenges. In April 2015, our country will host \r\nthe Summit of the Americas, and we are working on \r\nthis event that will bring together all the Heads of State \r\nand Government of our hemisphere in order to promote \r\nintegration and social peace with equity and prosperity.\r\nThe 193 countries of the world have different \r\npolitical systems, beliefs, religions and cultures that \r\nmust be respected. In spite of those differences, we \r\nall face common challenges. That is why, in order to \r\nsecure the well-being of our citizens, our Governments \r\nare called to find unity of criteria for strengthening \r\nmultilateral systems, which must be engaged with all \r\nthe strength of States in order to combat shared threats \r\nand problems.\r\nWithin conflicts and difficult situations at the global \r\nlevel, there are strong messages of hope — volunteer \r\nmedical doctors from all over the world are making \r\nprogress to fight Ebola in Africa, and several countries \r\nare united in the fight against terrorists whose atrocious \r\ncrimes affect innocent people and threaten international \r\npeace and security. Panama is aware of those efforts \r\nand supports them. We express our solidarity with all \r\nvictims and their families.\r\nI am convinced that the men and women we elect \r\nto public office must serve only the people who elected \r\nus and manage public power temporarily granted to us \r\nwith the purpose of improving the quality of life of our \r\npopulation. Politics is one of the strongest expressions \r\nof public service because it is the search for the common \r\ngood. The greatest legacy, which I will strive to build \r\nduring the next five years, is to leave the Panamanian \r\npeople a functional democracy, to strengthen the rule \r\nof law, where public servants are accountable only to \r\nthe nation, with strong institutions, accountability and \r\nwithout impunity, with a view to guaranteeing that \r\npublic administrations are honest and transparent. All \r\nGovernments have the obligation to ensure that State \r\nresources are used exclusively in the service of our \r\ncitizens, and that all public works and projects have the \r\npeople’s interests in mind.\r\nCommitted to that mission and to the achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, I became President \r\nof my country on 1 July and formed a Government that \r\nwill continue to foster the economic growth enjoyed \r\nby Panama, while giving priority to public investment \r\nthat has greater impact on the quality of life of all \r\nPanamanians. With an average domestic economic \r\ngrowth of 7 per cent, increasing foreign investment, \r\nlegal security, low inflation and unemployment rates, \r\nand a consolidated democratic system, we are making \r\ngood on the proposals for which I was elected.\r\nDuring our mandate, we have taken strong measures \r\nto curb speculation in the cost of food. We are working \r\nto ensure that Panamanian families have adequate \r\nhousing with access to drinking water, basic sanitation, \r\nwater supply, sewage systems and treatment plants for \r\nwaste water and solid waste. We have launched major \r\nsocial projects for our youth so that they grow up in safe \r\nneighbourhoods with better opportunities, jobs, sports \r\nfacilities and cultural centres to keep them away from \r\ncrime.\r\nOur public schools will have adequate facilities \r\nand teachers trained in the English language, in order \r\nto promote a bilingual education. Our social welfare \r\nprogrammes will allow all students to finish high school \r\nand senior citizens to live with dignity. Our students \r\nwill have the opportunity to go to college or study at \r\nnewly established higher technical institutes that will \r\nprepare them for the new jobs that our economy is \r\ncreating in the areas of logistics and tourism, inter alia.\r\n16/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nOur public health system will be unified, and the \r\nresulting savings will be used to strengthen preventive \r\nhealth programmes, ensuring better medical care, and \r\npremium quality treatments and medication. We are \r\nbuilding a modern and efficient public transportation \r\nsystem with the new projects to add second and third \r\nlines to the Metro of Panama City, thereby improving \r\nthe quality of life of our people. We will develop tourism \r\nand support air connectivity to and from principal \r\ncities in the United States, Canada, Latin America, the \r\nCaribbean and Europe. We will protect our logistical \r\nand financial systems to prevent organized crime and \r\ngangs from gaining access to them, and we shall tackle \r\norganized crime and gangs with the full force of the \r\nState in order to defeat them and keep them away from \r\nour youth and our neighbourhoods.\r\nOur Government will work tirelessly to prepare our \r\nyoung people to be responsible citizens of the world \r\nand care for our natural resources in order to ensure \r\nsustainable development. We will work closely with the \r\nprivate sector and civil society in order to fulfil those \r\nnational goals, the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nthe new challenges of the global agenda.\r\nWe live in a diverse world, with different cultures, \r\nreligions and political systems, but we can always find \r\ncommon ground in the well-being of our citizens. That \r\nwas the approach that led to the successful adoption \r\nof the Millennium Declaration, and it will be the key \r\nto defining and fulfilling the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nPanama is a country that is respectful of others and \r\nwilling to serve as a bridge to understanding, on the \r\nbasis of respect for diversity, tolerance, pluralism and \r\nhuman rights. Above all, the Assembly can be assured \r\nthat Panama’s Government is a Government of men and \r\nwomen who respect the law and are willing to share \r\nexperiences, learn from best practices and contribute \r\nto global peace, socio-economic development and the \r\nwell-being of all peoples.\r\nI would like to conclude by sharing a statement that \r\nhas been with me since my youth: “The time has come \r\nto put our capacity to use in service of others.” May \r\nGod give us the strength to continue to build together a \r\nbetter world for our citizens and for future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Panama for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): I \r\nam delighted to be here today to once again make a \r\ncontribution, on behalf of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, to the debate on the present and future of \r\nhumankind. I am especially delighted as this sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly is taking place \r\nat a time when the international situation is particularly \r\ndelicate. If we are not careful, three of its phenomena in \r\nparticular will surely delay us in achieving our agreed \r\ngoals. I am referring to the issues of terrorism, the \r\nresurgence of Ebola in Africa and the many threats to \r\npeace in various areas around the globe.\r\nDespite the commendable efforts of States and \r\ninternational organizations, terrorism, an extreme form \r\nof human intolerance, continues to claim victims — as \r\nmany in number as they are innocent — around the \r\nworld. Africa, which was once spared this type of \r\nsenseless violence, is today at its epicentre. The people \r\nof Libya, Mali, Kenya, Somalia, Nigeria and many other \r\ncountries in Europe, America and Asia are regularly \r\nbereaved by attacks, hostage-taking and summary \r\nexecutions. All States Members of our Organization \r\nmust face the threat collectively, as a moral obligation \r\nand the only effective strategy to eradicate this \r\nbarbarism surely and quickly.\r\nSince the previous session of the General Assembly, \r\na major public health problem has also hindered Africa \r\non its path towards development, namely, through the \r\nloss in human lives caused by Ebola in some countries of \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. In less than six months, the disease \r\nhas claimed over 2,000 lives, including approximately \r\n14-54847 17/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\n40 in my own country. Africa is leading a heroic battle \r\nagainst the virus. It deserves support.\r\nI am grateful to the international community, which \r\nis aware that, beyond the affected African populations \r\ntoday, all of humankind is under threat and which has \r\nextended its touching and effective solidarity to the \r\naffected countries. I thank the international community \r\nfor its significant technical and logistical support in the \r\nresponse against the epidemic. In the future, I hope to \r\nsee this fine example of human brotherhood prevail \r\nover the blind competition we see so often, and for it to \r\noccur with equal fervour in other sectors.\r\nAs for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nwhich is being touched for the seventh time by this \r\nscourge, we have not only managed to contain this new \r\nepidemic at its origin — in Boende territory, Equateur \r\nprovince — but also provided support to the fight \r\nagainst the epidemic in West Africa. Now that we have \r\nall but mastered the situation within the country, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo is ready to once again \r\nsend its experts to the other affected countries.\r\nI take this opportunity to announce from this \r\nrostrum that, on the basis of its over 30 years of \r\nexperience in the management of Ebola outbreaks, in \r\nOctober the Democratic Republic of the Congo will \r\nset up multidisciplinary training centres to train health \r\npersonnel to respond adequately, in terms of quality \r\nand quantity of care, to the needs of African countries \r\nthat have been or could in the future be affected by such \r\nan epidemic.\r\nAs for the wars that are engulfing various parts of \r\nthe world, including the Middle East, Ukraine, Syria, \r\nIraq, Libya and the Central African Republic, we \r\nshould first recall that the United Nations was created \r\nfollowing a world war, in order to establish mechanisms \r\ncapable of preventing, or at least managing, situations \r\nthat bring the world only grief and despair; and then \r\nwe should ask ourselves why at this point, decades \r\nafter the San Francisco Conference, humankind seems \r\nunable to maintain and guarantee peace. Knowing that \r\nin this area any contribution is welcome, I would like to \r\nreaffirm the commitment of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo to working tirelessly for peace and stability \r\nin Africa and around the world. That is the reason for \r\nthe presence of Congolese troop and police contingents \r\nin the Central African Republic.\r\nThe issue of peace is fundamental because, \r\nwithout it, humankind cannot realize or implement a \r\ntransformative development programme, as the central \r\ntheme of this session has it. Nor can that goal be achieved \r\nas long as terrorism is not contained and epidemics \r\nsuch as Ebola are not defeated. From experience, we \r\nCongolese know that there is no challenge that cannot \r\nbe met provided there is the will, the way and the \r\ndetermination. We all know where my country was \r\nbarely 13 years ago. Today I am happy to say that the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo is standing on its \r\nfeet once more. It is a country where a newfound peace \r\nis consolidated a little more every day; a country whose \r\neconomy is one of the most dynamic on the continent, \r\nwith an inflation rate close to zero, a growth rate that \r\nhas exceeded the African average for almost a decade, \r\nand steadily increasing foreign exchange reserves; a \r\ncountry undergoing total reconstruction, with roads, \r\nschools, hospitals and much other infrastructure being \r\nbuilt at an unprecedented rate and speed.\r\nOn the political front, consolidating democracy \r\nand strengthening national cohesion remain our top \r\npriorities. In that regard, I wish to confirm that our \r\nforthcoming elections will soon be held according to \r\nthe schedule set by the relevant national institution, the \r\nIndependent National Electoral Commission. Every \r\neffort is bring made to ensure that our country will \r\nemerge from them stronger, more peaceful and more \r\nunited.\r\nRegarding security, through the application of a \r\njudicious mix of political dialogue, diplomacy and \r\nmilitary action we have moved steadily closer to the goal \r\nwe have set ourselves of banishing negative forces from \r\nour land and thus helping to bring peace to the eastern \r\npart of the country and to our neighbours. In order to \r\nconsolidate peace and improve social conditions for the \r\npeople, we are working to improve the business climate \r\nso as to stimulate investment, promote greater added \r\nvalue locally and create more jobs.\r\nAs can be seen, my country has resolutely taken the \r\nroad of reconstruction, development and re-emergence \r\nand the defeat of poverty, injustice and inequality. It is \r\nan undeniably daunting task, and we still have some way \r\nto go to achieve our ultimate goal. But the people of the \r\nCongo are tackling it with enthusiasm and self lessness, \r\ndetermined as never before to make our march towards \r\nprogress irreversible and to propel the country to a level \r\nof development commensurate with its potential. To do \r\nthat, we must preserve stability at all costs, and that is \r\nwhat we will put the majority of our efforts into from \r\n18/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nnow on. And we count on the support of our partners in \r\nprioritizing everything that may involve.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks, I would like to \r\nreiterate the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s \r\ncontinuing plea for Africa to be fairly represented in \r\nthe decision-making organs of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the Security Council. The fact is that it \r\ndoes not make sense that Africa, a continent with six \r\nof the 10 fastest-growing economies in the world today, \r\nwhose growth rate and youthful population are portents \r\nof future demographic power and whose forests, \r\nfreshwater reserves and arable lands make it essential \r\nto the implementation of sustainable development \r\nstrategies, does not have a permanent seat within the \r\nentity responsible for ensuring peace and international \r\nsecurity. It is high time that this changed. It is a question \r\nof fairness, and it is also a condition of our collective \r\neffectiveness.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Rosen Plevneliev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Bulgaria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria.\r\nMr. Rosen Plevneliev, President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Rosen Plevneliev, President \r\nof the Republic of Bulgaria, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Plevneliev: Let me congratulate Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa of Uganda on his assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \r\nalso extend my warmest gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for \r\nhis work as President of the sixty-eighth session.\r\nOver the past few months, Bulgaria and the Balkans \r\nhave suffered unprecedented f loods. Thousands of \r\npeople lost their homes, crops were ruined and many \r\ninnocent people died. The heavy storms were no \r\nlonger news but a part of daily life. Nature once again \r\nreminded us that today, political statements alone were \r\nnot sufficient. For the sake of our children and our \r\nplanet, it is time to act. As a wise man once said, we did \r\nnot inherit the Earth from our fathers; we borrowed it \r\nfrom our children. Climate change needs to be urgently \r\naddressed. I would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for having organized the Climate Summit. \r\nBulgaria will actively support the completion of the \r\nnegotiations on the new, universal and legally binding \r\nclimate agreement in 2015.\r\nBulgaria contributed to the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and the development \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda through its \r\nsuccessful participation in the Open Working Group \r\non Sustainable Development Goals. The Group has \r\nfulfilled its mandate. The Group’s report, together \r\nwith the report of High-level Panel of Eminent Persons \r\non the Post-2015 Development Agenda (A/67/890, \r\nannex), will be the leading documents for our future \r\ndiscussions as we enter the critical phase of the debate \r\non the post-2015 development agenda. It is crucial \r\nthat all sides stay engaged and committed to the final \r\ngoal — an ambitious and forward-looking framework. \r\nNo real transformative post-2015 development agenda \r\nwill be possible unless we address the loopholes of the \r\ncurrent Millennium Development Goals and build upon \r\nthe lessons learned. The new framework should be \r\nfounded on the principles of respect for human rights, \r\ninclusiveness, good governance and the rule of law. \r\nYouth-specific targets in the areas of education, health \r\ncare and employment are of paramount importance as \r\nwell.\r\nDevelopment is unthinkable without peace and \r\nsecurity. The illegal annexation of Crimea by the \r\nRussian Federation and the conflict in eastern Ukraine \r\nhave become one of the most serious threats to peace \r\nand security in Europe since the Second World War. The \r\nsecurity environment in the Black Sea region has been \r\nseriously affected. The illegal annexation of Crimea \r\nundermines the international order. After the Second \r\nWorld War, we built our world on the clear principles \r\nembodied in the Charter of the United Nations. They \r\nwere shattered to pieces in a matter of weeks. Bulgaria \r\nstrongly supports the sovereignty, unity and territorial \r\nintegrity of Ukraine. My country does not recognize \r\nthe illegal referendum in Crimea and condemns the \r\n14-54847 19/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nannexation by Russia as a violation of international law. \r\nBulgaria joined the numerous sponsors of resolution \r\n68/262 on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\r\nMy country welcomes the ceasefire agreement and \r\nis looking forward to the implementation of the peace \r\nplan. Bulgaria commends all international efforts for \r\nthe peaceful resolution of the conflict. We welcome the \r\nstrong engagement of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nand the initiatives of the European Union and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \r\nas well as the efforts of the trilateral contact group. \r\nRussia should stop arming and supporting separatists \r\nin Ukraine.\r\nIn a few days, Ukrainians will vote for a new \r\nparliament. They have every right to choose their \r\nown future. I sincerely hope that those elections will \r\nbe a major step forward in building a democratic and \r\nprosperous Ukraine. The signing and ratification of the \r\nEuropean Union Association Agreements of Ukraine, \r\nMoldova and Georgia represent an important milestone \r\nin the process of the European integration of those \r\ncountries. The positive change witnessed today in \r\nthe Balkans would not have been possible without the \r\nengine of the European integration.\r\nThe escalation of violence and the humanitarian \r\nsituation in Syria continue to be a source of grave \r\nconcern. Millions of refugees have f led their homeland \r\nin pursuit of peace in the neighbouring countries. \r\nHundreds of thousands have lost their lives. More than \r\n10,000 refugees have sought asylum in Bulgaria. A \r\nlasting solution to the conflict in Syria can be achieved \r\nonly through an inclusive political process. We call on \r\nthe Security Council to unite. The unity of the Security \r\nCouncil is crucial in order for the conflict to be resolved.\r\nThe Syrian crisis, along with the outbreak of \r\nviolence and sectarian tensions in Iraq, has exacerbated \r\nthe security and humanitarian situation in the entire \r\nMiddle East region. Bulgaria strongly condemns the \r\narmed attacks and killings perpetrated by the Islamic \r\nState terrorist organization against religious and ethnic \r\nminorities and denounces the brutal execution of \r\ninnocent people. Bulgaria is an integral part of the broad \r\ninternational coalition against terrorism. A member of \r\nthe European Union and of NATO, my country lends its \r\npolitical support, as well as humanitarian and material \r\naid, within the scope of its possibilities. We welcome \r\nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) \r\non foreign terrorist fighters.\r\nCombating radicalization, supporting State-building \r\nin Iraq and cooperating with regional partners are \r\nessential. We welcome the election of Mr. Haider Al \r\nAbadi as Prime Minister of Iraq. We hope that, under \r\nhis leadership, a Government of broad representation \r\nwill be established in order to preserve the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of the country.\r\nBulgaria greatly values the role of the United Nations \r\nin Iraq and appreciates the contribution of Mr. Nickolay \r\nMladenov, former Bulgarian Foreign Minister, Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General and Head \r\nof the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq. \r\nWe stand for a just and lasting settlement of the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict based on the two-State \r\nsolution formula. That is possible only through direct \r\nnegotiations with no preconditions and in conformity \r\nwith the relevant international obligations. Any durable \r\nceasefire should address both Israeli security concerns \r\nand Palestinian demands to abolish the Gaza closure \r\nregime.\r\nThe adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty was a major \r\nachievement of the international community. Just over a \r\nyear later, the threshold of 50 ratifications was reached \r\nthis morning. I am glad that my country is among \r\nthose 50 States that have made the entry into force of \r\nthat important legal instrument a reality. The Arms \r\nTrade Treaty fills a serious gap in international law. \r\nIt establishes regulations for the trade in conventional \r\narms at the global level. Now its implementation and \r\nuniversalization are of the utmost importance.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, the Berlin Wall fell and the \r\ndemocratic transitions in Central and Eastern Europe \r\nbegan. My country Bulgaria chose to become a modern \r\nEuropean democracy. We put our country back on the \r\npath of freedom, independence, the rule of law and \r\nrespect for human rights. Our society has proved its \r\nfirm commitment to democratic values and principles. \r\nWe have witnessed similar political changes across \r\nSouth-East Europe. The Balkan countries have become \r\npartners, sharing the same values and projects for the \r\nfuture. We have built bridges of trust, friendship and \r\nmutual respect. We are working together to improve \r\nlinks and competition in order to increase prosperity \r\nin the Balkans.\r\nHuman rights, democracy and the rule of law \r\nare at the heart of my country’s foreign policy. \r\nBulgaria’s commitment to advancing the human rights \r\nagenda throughout the United Nations system was \r\nfurther strengthened under the successful Bulgarian \r\n20/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nchairmanship of the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural \r\nCommittee during the sixty-eighth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Bulgaria is determined to further \r\ncontribute to promoting and upholding human rights \r\ninternationally as a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2019-2021, and will rely on its \r\npartners’ valuable support of its candidature.\r\nMy country welcomes the appointment of \r\nPrince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al-Husein of Jordan as the \r\nnew United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights — an excellent choice by the Secretary-General. \r\nWe wish Prince Zeid all success in fulfilling his \r\nmandate.\r\nWe support the Secretary-General’s Rights Up \r\nFront Action Plan to safeguard human rights around \r\nthe world. Bulgaria commends Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral Jan Eliasson for his insightful vision and \r\nglobal leadership with regard to that initiative and his \r\nvaluable contribution to advancing the human rights \r\nagenda throughout the United Nations.\r\nBulgaria is concerned about the anti-Semitic attacks \r\nthat have taken place recently, especially in Europe. \r\nAs a country that saved 48,000 Bulgarian Jews from \r\ndeportation during the Second World War, Bulgaria \r\nstrongly condemns the recurring trend of brutal and \r\ndisgusting manifestations of anti-Semitism.\r\nThis year, the international community is \r\ncelebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which \r\nset a universal standard for the effective promotion of \r\nchildren’s rights. Bulgaria commends UNICEF for its \r\nenormous contribution during that time to improving \r\nchildren’s lives and advancing the child agenda around \r\nthe world. As a member of the Bureau of the UNICEF \r\nExecutive Board this year, my country supports \r\nand actively participates in all efforts aimed at child \r\nprotection and achieving results for children.\r\nMy country is convinced that the United Nations \r\nreform process should continue in order to enhance \r\nthe efficiency, representativeness and transparency of \r\nthe entire system, and to make it more adequate and \r\nresponsive to the new realities. As a member of the \r\nEastern European regional group, Bulgaria reiterates its \r\nposition in favour of allocating at least one additional \r\nnon-permanent seat to the Group in an enlarged Security \r\nCouncil. Bulgaria aspires to serve as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council for the 2018-2019 term.\r\nAt the end of 2016, the second term of office of \r\nthe current and highly respected Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, will come to an end. My country \r\ngreatly values his outstanding leadership and \r\ncommitment. Bulgaria expects that, when the time \r\ncomes, the States Members of the United Nations will \r\nbe able to elect a worthy successor. To that end I would \r\nlike to recall the relevant General Assembly resolution, \r\nwhich states that,\r\n“[i]n the course of the identification and \r\nappointment of the best candidate for the post of \r\nSecretary-General, due regard shall continue to be \r\ngiven to regional rotation and shall also be given \r\nto gender equality” (resolution 51/241, annex, para. \r\n59).\r\nBulgaria is convinced that the time has finally come \r\nfor the East European regional group to be represented \r\nat the helm of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Bulgaria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rosen Plevneliev, President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bujar Nishani, President of the \r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania.\r\nMr. Bujar Nishani, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Bujar Nishani, President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Nishani: It is a great pleasure for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \r\nFirst, allow me to congratulate the President of the \r\nAssembly on his election to that post and to assure him \r\nof the full support of my country during this session. \r\nI believe that, under his leadership and given his prior \r\nexperience, he will further advance the achievements of \r\nhis predecessor, who worked with dedication to achieve \r\nconcrete results.\r\n14-54847 21/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nIn addition, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our deep appreciation to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his vision and leadership at the helm of the United \r\nNations and his continuing efforts to revitalize and \r\nreform the Organization.\r\nAlbania is committed to an efficient and \r\ncoherent United Nations, fit for its purpose as a \r\nmultidimensional system. We support its strengthened \r\nrole and contribution to efforts to preserve peace and \r\nsecurity, eradicate poverty, inequality and disparity, \r\nachieve sustainable human and economic development, \r\nand promote respect for and protect human rights as a \r\nuniversal value of humankind. A more fitting United \r\nNations, with the ability to swiftly respond to man-\r\nmade or natural crises and effectively use available \r\nhuman and financial resources, is key to achieving \r\nthose objectives in view of an increasingly chaotic and \r\nhungry world.\r\nMaintaining, restoring and strengthening peace \r\nand security constitute one of the three pillars of the \r\nwork of the United Nations. With so many resources \r\nand so much knowledge and manpower invested in \r\ndealing with the various and complex crises around the \r\nglobe, it is simply impossible to ignore the contribution \r\nthe Organization has made to the world, year upon \r\nyear, decade upon decade. Yet in 2014 the challenges \r\nto peace, security and human values have continued, \r\nnecessitating more responsive, coordinated and swift \r\nreactions on the part of the United Nations.\r\nWe deplore the events in South Sudan, where \r\ntragedies have been played out and continue to shake \r\nhuman consciences. Fighting along ethnic lines \r\nhas brought far too much suffering to the innocent \r\npopulation. Only a negotiated political solution that \r\nconsiders, protects and respects the rights of all the \r\ncommunities concerned can help rebuild trust and \r\nunderstanding, turning the page on a better future for \r\nthe youngest country in the world.\r\nIt is hard to find the words to describe the situation \r\nin Syria. After more than three years of deadly fighting, \r\nthe country is barely liveable. Every kind of horrible \r\nact has happened there. More than 170,000 people \r\nhave died, millions are refugees, and large parts of the \r\ncountry are in ruins. With fighting and mass atrocities \r\nbeing committed every day, any hope of ending the war \r\nis a remote dream for those still trapped there. Albania \r\njoined the initiative taken by some 60 States Members \r\nof the United Nations to refer the situation in Syria to \r\nthe International Criminal Court. Unfortunately, like \r\nmany other initiatives on Syria, the effort was vetoed \r\nin the Security Council. We reiterate and reaffirm that \r\nthe perpetrators of atrocities in Syria must be held \r\naccountable and that the people of Syria deserve relief \r\nand justice.\r\nThe events this year in Ukraine have been deeply \r\nworrying. What we thought was behind us once and \r\nfor all, what we believed belonged to the history books \r\nand would serve as a lesson for today’s generation and \r\nthose of the future — acts violating the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of another country, blatantly \r\ninfringing and undermining the Charter of the United \r\nNations — was unfortunately exhumed by a Member \r\nof the United Nations, a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, the Russian Federation.\r\nDespite all the propaganda that Russia spewed \r\nforth, the Ukrainian crisis had nothing to do with \r\nprotecting the rights of ethnic Russians. It was much \r\nsimpler — from the first, it was about the ambition of a \r\nmore powerful country to redraw another’s borders in \r\norder to satisfy its appetite for its neighbour’s territory. \r\nAlthough the Security Council has been unable to act on \r\nthis issue, the General Assembly voted overwhelmingly \r\nnot to accept Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. \r\nThe States Members of the United Nations, including \r\nAlbania, made clear their support for the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and their full \r\nrespect for the norms and principles of international \r\nlaw, and we reiterate that international relations must be \r\ngoverned by full respect for the principles and norms of \r\ninternational law and the Charter. The case of Ukraine \r\nis no exception.\r\nWith these crises and disasters erupting in a \r\nfrightening pattern and the world spiraling into \r\ninsecurity, development has also been under stress. \r\nThe United Nations has contributed to raising global \r\nawareness of the challenges facing development and the \r\nsustainable solutions that can bring economic growth, \r\nsocial inclusion and environmental protection and put \r\nour planet on a sustainable path.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\ncreated one of the most successful global anti-poverty \r\ndrives in history. Covering poverty, hunger, maternal \r\nand child health, gender equality, education and the \r\nenvironment, the MDGs have seen important progress \r\nat the national, regional and global levels and have \r\nimproved the lives of millions. The number of people \r\nliving in extreme poverty has been halved since 2005, \r\n22/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nbut with the deadline just months away, a lot remains \r\nto be done.\r\nBut another ambitious long-term sustainability \r\nagenda, designed to succeed the MDGs, is in the \r\nmaking. Albania has been an active participant in \r\nthe global consultations focused on making the \r\npeople’s voices part of the formulation of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. Albania has agreed to test a \r\nproposed development goal on governance and the rule \r\nof law designed to help countries achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We hope our experience in monitoring \r\ngovernance, the rule of law and effective, capable \r\ninstitutions will help to inform the upcoming post-2015 \r\nagenda of the United Nations.\r\nTerrorism remains a major threat to international \r\npeace and security, and the fight against terrorism is \r\na priority that requires a greater commitment. We are \r\naware that this global threat can be countered only with \r\ncollective action and a powerful response. Albania \r\ncondemns in the strongest terms all terrorist attacks \r\nby terrorist groups and organizations in Iraq and Syria, \r\nincluding and especially by the Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nthe Levant (ISIL). Conscious that terrorism is a threat \r\nwithout borders, a threat to human values and principles \r\nas well as to individual countries and regions, Albania \r\nhas joined the recently created international coalition \r\naimed at deterring and eventually defeating ISIL.\r\nEuropean integration and cooperation in our \r\nregion, and the geopolitical and security situation in \r\nEurope, have changed significantly in recent months. \r\nThe Western Balkans, of which my country is part, is \r\nan important geo-strategic European region and one \r\nthat recently committed fully to a path of increased \r\npolitical stability, economic progress and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, with strengthened cooperation, security \r\ncharacterized by good relations with its neighbours, \r\nand peace consolidation. The European route is the best \r\nguarantee for achieving these objectives in our region.\r\nWe are committed to resolving various bilateral \r\nissues as soon as possible, in the interests of our people \r\nand our neighbourly relations. We are fully aware \r\nthat we must enact a number of measures to eradicate \r\ncorruption and organized crime. Like every country \r\nin the region, we have expressed our willingness \r\nto conduct joint reforms that will bring increased \r\neconomic stability and prosperity for our citizens and \r\nthat will open markets and attract foreign investment.\r\nThe Republic of Kosovo is one of the members of \r\nour Western Balkan community, the youngest State \r\nin the region. In less than six years as an independent \r\nState, Kosovo has managed, through a transformative \r\ndevelopment agenda, to enjoy wide, uninterrupted \r\ninternational recognition and to successfully integrate \r\ninto international, regional and global organizations, \r\nsuch as the World Bank, the International Monetary \r\nFund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \r\nDevelopment, the European Bank for Development, \r\nthe Venice Commission, the South-East European \r\nCooperation Process and others. Kosovo has become an \r\nimportant factor for peace and stability in the region, \r\nand Albania fully supports its overall development, as \r\nwell as its stability and territorial integrity within its \r\ncurrent borders.\r\nKosovo’s progress, the new atmosphere in the \r\nregion, and the need for the region as a whole to move \r\ntowards more cooperation and prosperity have led \r\ndown the path to successful European Union-sponsored \r\ntalks between Kosovo and Serbia as two equal partners \r\nin seeking concrete solutions to technical issues of \r\nimportance to their citizens. Time has shown that \r\nengaging in dialogue was a wise decision. Dialogue has \r\nproduced concrete results, brought the two countries \r\ncloser to each other, and facilitated and sped up the \r\nEuropean Union integration path for both States. \r\nAlbania fully supports the process of dialogue and calls \r\nfor the full implementation of the agreements reached.\r\nTo date, Kosovo has been recognized by 108 States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, representing more than \r\nhalf of the United Nations membership. Recognition \r\nhas without doubt been an important factor in Kosovo’s \r\nprogress. That is why, as before, we call on the countries \r\nthat have not yet recognized Kosovo to do so, since in \r\nso doing they would not only help the people of Kosovo \r\nadvance towards their future but also contribute to \r\npeace and stability in the region.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe remain convinced that the quick and full \r\nimplementation of the Ohrid Framework Agreement \r\nrepresents a condition indispensable to the sustainable \r\nstability of Macedonia, to the consolidation of \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, and to fulfilling and \r\nrealizing the rights of Albanians. Albania encourages \r\nthe continuation of dialogue between the Belgrade \r\nauthorities and the Albanians of the Presheva valley to \r\n14-54847 23/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\npromote their rights in accordance with international \r\nstandards, focusing especially on solving economic, \r\nsocial, educational and cultural problems.\r\nDuring the past two decades, Albania has been \r\ntransformed from a totalitarian State into a functioning \r\ndemocracy. Progress is evident, above all, in the field \r\nof human rights. The protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights are one of the national priorities and \r\npart of Albania’s foreign policy. Albania offers a \r\nvaluable model of respect for diversity, tolerance and \r\ncoexistence for the Balkan region and beyond. For the \r\nAlbanian people, tolerance and hospitality are inherent \r\nvalues derived from our national tradition.\r\nThe presentation of Albania’s candidacy for \r\nmembership on the Human Rights Council for the \r\n2015-2017 term is only a logical consequence of \r\nour road towards building a society based on human \r\nrights. We are confident that Albania has accumulated \r\nvaluable experience in democracy over the years that \r\nit can share with other member countries of the United \r\nNations. Moreover, by reaffirming the universality, \r\nindivisibility and interdependence of human rights, \r\nAlbania is committed to bringing a national and \r\nregional perspective into the Council’s deliberations \r\nand advocacy of human rights worldwide.\r\nWe are aware that our membership in the Council \r\nfor the 2015-2017 term is a challenge bearing great \r\nresponsibility to justify the confidence of Member \r\nStates. On the other hand, Human Rights Council \r\nmembership would serve as an impetus for my country \r\nto further democratization and to raise human rights \r\nstandards. Therefore, Albania, after obtaining the \r\nendorsement of the group of Eastern European States, \r\nwould welcome and appreciate the support of all other \r\nMember States for its candidacy to the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate Albania’s \r\ndetermination to continue its support of the United \r\nNations agenda and strengthening the role of the United \r\nNations globally.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Albania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Bujar Nishani, President of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. János Áder, President of Hungary\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Hungary.\r\nMr. János Áder, President of Hungary, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. János Áder, President of \r\nHungary, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Áder (spoke in Hungarian; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): “If you seek peace, prepare \r\nfor war.” Those are the words of Publius Flavius \r\nVegetius Renatus’ fourth- or fifth-century tract De \r\nRe Militari, written more than 1,600 years ago. People \r\nhave quoted that saying numerous times and in many \r\ncircumstances. If the Assembly believes after all this \r\nthat I am going to speak about the wars and armed \r\nconflicts raging throughout the world, it is mistaken. \r\nInstead, I would like to speak to the Assembly about a \r\nwar and a battle that we seem to be losing. It is a war we \r\nare waging against our own natural environment and \r\nagainst our own human nature.\r\nTwo days ago here in the General Assembly \r\nHall, many heard the words of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon and President Obama about the dire \r\nconsequences of climate change (see A/69/PV.6). We \r\nheard very detailed statistics illustrating the gravity of \r\nthe situation and the need for us to pool our efforts. And \r\nwe have been preparing for that for a long time.\r\nWhen did we first notice signs of trouble with the \r\nenvironment? Few people may know that the first clear \r\nsignal came in 1896, when a Swedish scientist wrote that \r\nan increase in the atmospheric level of carbon dioxide \r\nwould lead to a temperature rise; 60 years later, we had \r\nprecise measurements to substantiate his statement. \r\nAnother 30 years had to pass before here, in the United \r\nNations, it was understood that some type of treaty or \r\nagreement would be necessary in the future to deal with \r\nthe issue. Another 10 years had to pass before the Kyoto \r\nProtocol was signed. Between the first realization and \r\nthe Kyoto agreement a century had passed.\r\nAfter Kyoto, a number of conferences, scientific \r\nmeetings and political gatherings were held. In recent \r\ndecades, many people have spoken on many occasions \r\nabout the consequences of climate change and the need \r\nto do something. Still the situation has continued to \r\ndeteriorate. Let me cite one statistic. Since 1990 — that \r\n24/25 14-54847\r\nA/69/PV.10 25/09/2014\r\nis, during the past 25 years — despite all the resolve, \r\nthe Kyoto agreement and all the promises, we have seen \r\na 30 per cent increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide.\r\nDespite the fact that Mother Nature has warned \r\nus again and again, adverse climate events continue to \r\noccur one after the other. Allow me to mention a few \r\nexamples from the past year. In 2013 in the state of Uttar \r\nPradesh in India, there were freezing temperatures in \r\nJanuary, which was unprecedented. At the same time, \r\nin Lapland in Finland — not exactly the Mediterranean \r\nregion — in May the temperature had reached 31°C, \r\nwhile Bethlehem experienced a white Christmas that no \r\none remembered having seen before. In Australia, over \r\nthe course of 90 days last summer, 123 temperature \r\nrecords were set.\r\nThe Danube is the largest river in Europe and it \r\nhas warned us again and again. Allow me to report a \r\nHungarian example. Since before the Second World \r\nWar, the Danube River has f looded many times, but \r\nuntil recently it had never risen to the level of 8  metres, \r\neven at the f lood’s highest point. In the past four years, \r\nthe Danube has risen above 8 metres on four separate \r\noccasions. In fact last year, it rose close to 9 metres.\r\nFloods, typhoons and other adverse meteorological \r\nevents are taking place in regions where they have \r\nnever occurred before and at unprecedented times of \r\nthe year. We are meeting here in New York. Two years \r\nago here in New York, Hurricane Sandy caused damage \r\nvalued at $20 billion, and more than 40 people died. \r\nThis all took place despite the fact that for years on end \r\nthe New York City leadership had been cautioned by \r\nscientists that trouble would occur and that protection \r\nfor embankments, among others, must be strengthened. \r\nA few hundred million dollars would have been spent to \r\nthat end; instead, the damage caused by Sandy cost far \r\nmore. That is why, two days ago, the Assembly heard \r\nthe Mayor of New York speak of the next 35 years and \r\nthe desire to reduce New York’s emissions by 80 per \r\ncent.\r\nIn recent days, we have spoken on many occasions \r\nabout our preparations for the 2015 Paris conference \r\nand the desire to reach an agreement there. I believe \r\nthat Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon needs to be \r\nrecognized in that regard. He has truly done his utmost \r\nto ensure that we can reach a common conclusion in \r\nParis in 2015. The question is, are we Member States \r\ndoing all we can? Will we do all that we can to ensure \r\nsuccess in Paris?\r\nThe speeches I have heard over the past few days \r\nhave not made me optimistic. The speeches I have heard \r\ndeflected responsibility and reflected a type of political \r\nnarrow-mindedness that is not terribly promising. Why \r\ncan we not listen to the wisdom and advice of our \r\nscientists? Why can we not accept scientific results \r\nthat today appear evident? Why can we not accept the \r\nsignals being dispatched by our planet? Why can we not \r\nlearn from all of the lessons provided by Mother Nature? \r\nWhy are we not learning from our own example?\r\nThere is one good example that we could learn \r\nfrom. It involves chlorofluorocarbon gases and the \r\ndamage they cause to the ozone layer. Basically, those \r\ngases were first used in the 1950s. It took only 30 years \r\nfor the ozone layer to be reduced by 40 per cent in the \r\narea above Antarctica. That was also enough time for \r\npeople in every country to understand the medical \r\nconsequences. I note, among others, the high incidence \r\nof dermatological cancers. It was basically only at the \r\nvery last moment in Montreal that an agreement was \r\nstruck, as a result of which we banned those gases. After \r\n35 years, last week we saw the first report discussing a \r\nregeneration of the ozone layer.\r\nRegarding political narrow-mindedness, we saw \r\nexamples of that in the past. I will cite one. United \r\nStates President Reagan’s Secretary of the Interior, \r\nDonald Hodel, said that one way to protect against the \r\nthinning ozone layer was to purchase wide-brim hats \r\nand wear dark sunglasses. Why must we wait for the \r\nconcentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide to result \r\nin a situation as serious as that involving the ozone \r\nlayer? Why can we not, late next year, make Paris as \r\nsuccessful as Montreal?\r\nI believe that the problem is larger than we \r\nimagine. Scientists already agree that the desired and \r\noften articulated objective of limiting the temperature \r\nincrease to 2°C has become increasingly elusive. \r\nOnly a few days ago, we read that the carbon dioxide \r\nconcentration has never been higher than it was last year. \r\nWe may well have reached the point at which, whether \r\nor not we come to an agreement today or tomorrow, \r\nscientists will tell us that all the consequences of \r\nirresponsible decisions past and present would still be \r\nfelt in the future in the form of f loods, typhoons and \r\nother adverse climate events.\r\nWe have to come to terms with the idea — and \r\nI would say that it will be very difficult — that the \r\ncoming generation, our children’s generation, will \r\n14-54847 25/25\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.10\r\nunfortunately have to live with that situation. We \r\nwill have to pay a dear price for our irresponsible \r\nenvironmental policies.\r\nToday it is no longer enough to reduce emissions. \r\nIt is no longer enough to agree to reduce emissions. \r\nWe have to prepare for more and more serious natural \r\nevents and disasters. We have to heed the advice of \r\nNicholas Stern, who said eight years ago that if we \r\ndid not spend 1 per cent of our gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) on prevention, then the environmental damage \r\nwe would suffer could amount to as much as 20 per \r\ncent of GDP.\r\nI have just cited the example of New York City. A \r\nfew hundred million dollars would have been enough to \r\nmitigate damages totaling several billion. The New York \r\nexample tells us that we are not in the twenty-fourth \r\nhour, but in the twenty-fifth. The tragedy endured by \r\nthis metropolis, the host of our meeting, again justifies \r\nthe words of Vegetius, somewhat amended to the \r\nsituation — if you seek calm, prepare for disaster.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Hungary for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. János Áder, President of Hungary, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
