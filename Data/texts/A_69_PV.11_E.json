I have no doubt that his election at this juncture \r\nwill bring to the notice of the world some of the \r\nproblems and opportunities that exist in Africa. Malawi \r\nand Uganda have enjoyed cordial relations for a long \r\ntime and my Government and my delegation will do all \r\nwe can to support him in that very important position.\r\nLet me also take the opportunity to congratulate \r\nhis predecessor, Ambassador John William Ashe, for \r\nguiding the work of the sixty-eighth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly with skill and pragmatism. I would \r\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nthe steady manner in which he continues to guide our \r\nglobal Organization.\r\nOn 20 May, my country held its first ever tripartite \r\nelections, which enabled Malawians to choose their \r\npolitical leadership through a democratic and peaceful \r\nprocess. The elections ushered me into office as the \r\nfifth President of the Republic of Malawi. I would \r\ntherefore like to inform the Assembly that, despite a \r\nfew challenges, the elections were free, fair, transparent \r\nand credible. In that vein, let me seize the opportunity \r\nto thank all the electoral stakeholders, both local and \r\ninternational, for their dedication to ensuring successful \r\nelections in my country. Malawi has come out of the \r\nelection much stronger than before.\r\nOn 6 July, Malawi commemorated the golden \r\njubilee of its independence. As we commemorate the 50 \r\nyears of peace, law and order, we have tasked ourselves \r\nwith taking stock of the development that the country \r\nhas registered since 1964, as well as the challenges \r\nthat the country faces today. Much of the country has \r\nmade some progress in diverse sectors of our national \r\ndevelopment, but there is still more to be done in order \r\nto uplift the living standards of the many Malawians \r\nwho continue to remain below the poverty line. They \r\ntoo dream of a better future, which is possible only \r\nif we work with unity of purpose. In a quest to take \r\ndevelopment to the micro level, my Government \r\nhas embarked on a journey to transform Malawi so \r\nas to ensure the delivery of satisfactory services to \r\nMalawians, especially the poor and the marginalized.\r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.11\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n11th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 25 September 2014, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, Malawi was the chair of \r\nthe Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) \r\nfrom August 2013 until August 2014. During our term \r\nof office, we strove as a region to achieve long-lasting \r\npeace and stability in our countries. In that vein, let \r\nme commend my country, Malawi, and the countries of \r\nMadagascar and South Africa for holding peaceful and \r\ncredible elections.\r\nThe SADC group has been undertaking a number \r\nof efforts aimed at ending the cycle of conflicts and \r\nviolence in the region. In the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, SADC deployed the Force Intervention \r\nBrigade, comprising troops from Malawi, South Africa \r\nand Tanzania, under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, as authorized under Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2098 (2013). The SADC group, as \r\nwell as the international community, is pleased with \r\nthe success achieved in getting the Mouvement du 23 \r\nmars and other negative forces to leave the country and \r\nsurrender. In Madagascar, SADC played a crucial role \r\nin bringing back constitutional normalcy in the country.\r\nIn terms of international peace and security, I \r\nwould like to inform this gathering that Malawi has \r\nalways supported the disarmament of all weapons \r\nof mass destruction. To that end, we have supported \r\nresolutions in the General Assembly aimed at nuclear \r\ndisarmament. Over and above that, a couple of months \r\nago, my country held an in-country workshop to come \r\nup with mechanisms to implement Security Council \r\nresolution 1540 (2004) at the national level to prevent \r\nthe proliferation of nuclear, chemical and biological \r\nweapons and their means of delivery.\r\nOn the same subject, in the Middle East, Malawi \r\nhas always been disheartened and disappointed by \r\nthe continuing violence and loss of life and property \r\nresulting from the conflict between Israel and Palestine. \r\nThat cannot go on forever. We trust that the two-State \r\nsolution to the conflict, with Israel and Palestine living \r\nside by side, in peace and harmony, is the only viable \r\nway to achieve lasting peace in the region. We encourage \r\nboth sides to the dispute to renounce violence, exercise \r\nutmost restraint and employ dialogue as the sure tool to \r\nreach a political settlement.\r\nAs for the post-2015 development agenda, the choice \r\nof “Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda” as the theme for the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly could not \r\nbe more appropriate. The fight against poverty, hunger \r\nand inequality constitutes the greatest challenge of our \r\ntime. The theme further augurs well for the future in \r\nrelation to the plans and aspirations of the people of \r\nMalawi.\r\nMalawi appreciates the consultative nature of \r\nthe process followed in designing the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Let me therefore commend the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiatives to ensure an inclusive \r\nprocess that will lead to the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. With financial and technical support from the \r\nUnited Nations, more than 50 countries have conducted \r\nnational consultations, in which people provided input \r\nand direction on the post-2015 development framework. \r\nI am pleased that Malawi was one of the countries \r\nselected for those national consultations. The post-\r\n2015 development agenda should reflect the needs and \r\npriorities of the developing world.\r\nIt is important that the next global development \r\nagenda draw lessons from the successes and challenges \r\nof the current blueprint being used, namely, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Rather than \r\nseeing 2015 as an end point, we must think of it as the \r\nbeginning of a new era, an era in which we eradicate \r\nextreme poverty, protect the environment and promote \r\neconomic opportunity for all. The MDGs have played \r\nan important role in concentrating our efforts around \r\nthe common purpose of eradicating poverty. They \r\nhave raised public awareness about the unacceptable \r\nlevels of poverty and have helped mobilize action \r\ntowards a fairer world. The MDGs provided a common \r\nframework for monitoring progress, highlighting areas \r\nof achievement as well as challenges.\r\nMalawi is on track for achieving four of the eight \r\nMDGs, namely, reducing child mortality; combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability; and developing a global \r\npartnership for development. However, we are unlikely \r\nto meet the other four goals, namely, eradicating \r\nextreme poverty and hunger; achieving universal \r\naccess to education; ensuring gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women; and improving maternal \r\nhealth. Malawi will therefore be proceeding to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda with unfinished business \r\nfrom the MDGs.\r\nOne reason why developing countries like Malawi \r\nhave failed to achieve all of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals is inadequate resources. Commitments made by \r\ndevelopment partners have been unpredictable and \r\nhave often gone unfulfilled. To achieve delivery of the \r\n14-54929 3/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\npost-2015 development agenda, the global community \r\nshould not repeat that mistake. More importantly, \r\naccountability and transparency, as well as monitoring \r\nand evaluation mechanisms, should be promoted. \r\nIt is therefore imperative that, as we move closer to \r\nwelcoming the new global development agenda, we \r\nshould all be mindful of the importance of global \r\npartnership for effective development cooperation. That \r\nwould ensure the agenda’s successful implementation \r\nin developing countries.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda should not \r\nbe seen as a one-size-fits-all global development \r\nframework. Malawi is looking forward to a framework \r\nthat is shared, but differentiated enough, where \r\ndeveloping countries, depending on their special needs \r\nand unique characteristics, will have f lexibility in \r\nimplementing programmes. My delegation is pleased \r\nwith the tremendous progress made thus far in defining \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. It is in that context \r\nthat I would like to reiterate and confirm Malawi’s \r\ncommitment to achieving sustainable development in \r\nthree interconnected dimensions, namely, economic \r\ndevelopment, including the end of extreme poverty; \r\nsocial inclusion; and environmental sustainability.\r\nI am convinced that Member States gathered here \r\ntoday will own the outcome document of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and will be committed to its full \r\nimplementation. It is also encouraging to note that the \r\nsustainable development goals that emanated from the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals have incorporated the development concerns of \r\nboth the developed and developing world.\r\nWith respect to Security Council reform, the year \r\n2015 will mark, as the General Assembly is aware, \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nAs such, it will be an occasion for all of us to bring \r\nnew energy into the Organization and carry out the \r\nimportant reforms that we have been calling for since \r\nits inception. For instance, the limited representation \r\nin the Security Council is a source of great concern, \r\nparticularly in the light of the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Only by expanding the number of \r\npermanent and non-permanent members of the Council \r\nand by including developing countries in both categories \r\nwill we be able to solve some of the legitimacy deficits \r\nunder which the Council is currently labouring.\r\nIn conclusion, I would submit that the centre of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda should be to address \r\nthe plight of hitherto disadvantaged groups, such as \r\nwomen, girls and persons with disabilities. It is a well-\r\nknown fact that the ugly face of poverty manifests itself \r\nthrough women, girls and persons with disabilities. \r\nIt is sad that Africa, the continent to which Malawi \r\nbelongs, shares the following worrisome statistics in \r\nterms of human development. First, its share of global \r\npoverty is as high as 30 per cent. Secondly, 40 per cent \r\nof the continent’s children under 5 are stunted in their \r\ngrowth. Thirdly, Africa’s share of global child mortality \r\namounts to 50 per cent. Finally, 50 per cent of Africa’s \r\nchildren are not in school.\r\nI urge that the post-2015 development agenda give \r\npriority to those challenges for redress. Africa has \r\nalready spoken clearly about its priorities through the \r\nCommon African Position on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and through the African Union’s Agenda 2063, \r\nwhich aspires to achieve a prosperous, peaceful and \r\nintegrated Africa.\r\nIn that vein, I wish to call on all stakeholders to \r\njoin the global partnership for effective development \r\ncooperation principles by implementing and delivering \r\non a transformative post-2015 development agenda. \r\nMalawi will use its position as Chair of the Global \r\nPartnership for Effective Development Cooperation to \r\nhelp realize that cause.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Malawi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNauru.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Waqa: Allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency \r\n4/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \r\nLet me assure him of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation as he steers our work during this session. I \r\nmust also commend his predecessor, Ambassador John \r\nAshe, for showing such capable leadership during the \r\nprevious session. He led the small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) through several important milestones \r\nduring his tenure, including the International Year \r\nof Small Island Developing States and the recently \r\nconcluded International Conference on SIDS in Samoa.\r\nIt has been said that the stars are aligned with SIDS \r\nthis year. Ambassador Ashe has been our brightest \r\nbeacon, and I thank him very much for that. Let me \r\nalso thank another champion of the SIDS, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. Indeed, earlier this year, I \r\nsat in the Trusteeship Council Chamber when the \r\nSecretary-General helped us celebrate the launch of the \r\nInternational Year of Small Island Developing States. \r\nShowing a remarkable understanding of our unique \r\ncircumstances, he said:\r\n“The International Year offers us the \r\nopportunity to celebrate the rich cultural heritage \r\nof the people of small island developing States and \r\nto honour their many contributions to our world. \r\nIt is also an opportunity to highlight the various \r\nneeds and challenges of this diverse coalition. \r\nSome small island developing States have enjoyed \r\nlong-lasting stability. Others are in transition. Some \r\nare economically more fragile than others... Others \r\nare extremely vulnerable to the immediate effects \r\nof climate change. But all small island developing \r\nStates share a common understanding. We need to \r\nset our world on a sustainable path.”\r\nThe challenges of SIDS are many. One need only \r\nglance at the headlines to appreciate that they join a \r\nlong list of concerns that the international community \r\nmust confront today: naked brutality, pestilence, \r\npoverty and the worsening impacts of climate change, \r\nto name only a few. I understand the impulse for us to \r\nput off hard decisions to another day, prioritize some \r\nover others, or even bury our heads in the sand. But \r\nthe General Assembly is and remains the pre-eminent \r\nforum for grappling with global crises, and the United \r\nNations is our best hope for solving them.\r\nHowever, if we are to be successful, we must \r\nacknowledge a reality that lies beneath so many of those \r\nchallenges, namely, that we live in an interconnected \r\nworld and that the actions of one country or region \r\nimpact the lives of people half a world away. Conflict, \r\npoverty and disease can send refugees across borders \r\nand oceans and sometimes all the way to our shores. \r\nWe can no longer escape each other. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral also remarked, we all share the same island.\r\nAlso, we must consider my country’s connection \r\nto the ocean. As for so many SIDS, the ocean is the \r\nfoundation of our culture and economy, and we depend \r\non its bounty for food and income. Yet the reckless \r\nactions of other nations have severely undermined the \r\nmarine environment on which we so depend — from \r\nexcessive greenhouse gas emissions that warm the \r\nplanet and make the seas more and more acidic to \r\nirresponsible overfishing, the outright stealing of fish \r\nin our waters, and dangerous pollution, the effect of \r\nwhich we have yet to fully comprehend.\r\nAll the while, some of those same countries \r\nresponsible for the damage are also charged with \r\nassessing the well-being of the marine environment. \r\nHow can we be confident that our interests will be \r\nprotected in that effort? We, as a developing country, \r\nare constantly facing demands for greater transparency \r\nand accountability from the same actors that downplay, \r\nand sometimes even cover up, their own transgressions.\r\nFinding lasting solutions to problems such as \r\nthose will require more resources and a level of \r\ncooperation that the international community has \r\nso far not countenanced. It will also require us to \r\nlook at the failings in the global order that somehow \r\nprevent countries such as mine from accessing the fair \r\neconomic benefits of our own resources. Nevertheless, \r\nwe cannot just stand by and do nothing. We cannot and \r\nshould not wait for others to decide what is best for us. \r\nFor that reason, the parties to the Nauru Agreement \r\nare taking the lead in successfully managing their tuna \r\nstocks through such measures as curbing illegal fishing \r\nand sustainable harvesting.\r\nThe President has wisely chosen “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda” as the theme of the general debate of the \r\nsixty-ninth session. It goes to the heart of the central \r\ntask before us — not only fulfilling the long-standing \r\npromises with regard to sustainable development but \r\nalso engendering a paradigm shift in the way that we \r\nachieve such development. The current piecemeal \r\napproach, where a donor’s political interests determine \r\naid priorities, may treat symptoms for a time, but it fails \r\nto address the underlying disease.\r\n14-54929 5/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nIf we want our efforts to be successful over the \r\nlong term, we need to build a foundation that develops \r\nglobal citizens and gives them the tools they need to \r\nsucceed in a global world. In other words, we must \r\nmove beyond capacity-building to institution-building. \r\nWhat is needed is long-term in-country engagement, \r\nbacked by real resources, that produces durable \r\ndomestic institutions run by nationals. We cannot let \r\nnew and emerging issues distract or diminish work on \r\ncore priorities that remain inadequately addressed. We \r\nmay be experiencing our own fatigue when we again \r\nraise the issues of overfishing, climate adaptation and \r\nwater treatment, but those are often the areas most in \r\nneed of attention.\r\nI know that tackling all of those problems will be a \r\ntall order and may seem quite daunting, I am absolutely \r\nconfident that this institution and its agencies are up \r\nto the task. We have made some progress in reducing \r\nhunger, poverty and disease. And just this week, the \r\nworld watched as leaders gathered at the Climate \r\nSummit to announce the actions that their countries and \r\ncorporations are planning in order to lower greenhouse \r\ngas emissions responsible for the climate crisis. The \r\nSummit provided hope that, at least in some corners, \r\nserious climate action is imminent. However, it was \r\nhard to ignore the fact that most announcements were \r\nabout the greenhouse gas reductions that would occur \r\nunder some future Government a decade or more in the \r\nfuture.\r\nWhat is more, SIDS, which contribute only a \r\nfraction of global emissions, have undertaken to build \r\nsustainable economies while announcing some of the \r\nmost ambitious pledges to cut emissions. For example, \r\nwe are working closely with the International Renewable \r\nEnergy Agency, through their Lighthouses initiative, \r\nto achieve our own goal of a 50 per cent reduction \r\nin 2020. My own regional group, the Pacific SIDS, \r\nled the General Assembly to formally recognize the \r\nconnection between climate change and international \r\npeace and security in 2009 and helped convince the \r\nSecurity Council to do the same in 2011.\r\nBut, while few countries doubt the correlation \r\nbetween climate change and conflict today and despite \r\ngraphic examples of such in the past few years alone, \r\nthere is still disagreement as to the way forward. \r\nTherefore, we are still of the opinion that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral should appoint a special representative on \r\nclimate and security to analyse the projected security \r\nimpacts of the crisis. In addition, the Secretary-General \r\nshould lead a joint task force of all relevant organs \r\nand specialized agencies to assess the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations system to respond. That is the least we \r\ncan do as an international body to prepare for one of the \r\nbiggest challenges of our generation.\r\nIf the Security Council is to remain relevant, it \r\nmust be adaptive enough to meet the latest threats, and \r\nclimate change is a clear and present danger that we \r\nignore at our own peril. The Security Council must also \r\nreflect new geopolitical realities by becoming more \r\nrepresentative and inclusive. It is for that reason that \r\nNauru supports the reform of the Security Council by \r\nenlarging its permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nand making its working methods more efficient. New \r\nmembers should be more geographically diverse, \r\nbut they must also be willing to broaden their vision \r\nbeyond a narrow focus on domestic interests to include \r\na commitment to the common good of all Member \r\nStates.\r\nSimilarly, the United Nations should ensure that all \r\ncitizens of the world have the opportunity to participate \r\nin its activities. It must work for the 10,000 people in \r\nNauru and other small countries, and it must not continue \r\nto ignore the 24 million people in Taiwan, who time \r\nand again have demonstrated a commitment to peace \r\nand regional cooperation. Nauru is pleased to note that, \r\nwith solid international support and the cross-Strait \r\nrapprochement, the Republic of China has increased its \r\nmeaningful participation in United Nations specialized \r\nagencies and mechanisms. We continue to encourage \r\nthe positive interaction between the two sides of the \r\nTaiwan Strait in the international arena. Furthermore, \r\nI would like to recognize the contributions that Taiwan \r\nhas made to help my country make progress towards \r\nits national sustainable development strategy. I take \r\nthe opportunity to also express my country’s deep \r\nappreciation to our friends and partners who continue \r\nto support our sustainable development priorities, \r\nincluding Australia, Russia, New Zealand, the European \r\nUnion, Cuba, Israel and Turkey, to mention a few.\r\nThe world is rapidly changing, and the new realities \r\nhave strained the ability of the United Nations to \r\nrespond adequately. Long-term solutions will require \r\na new commitment to providing adequate means of \r\nimplementation. On climate change alone, we are far \r\nfrom the goal of providing $100 billion a year by 2020 \r\nto help nations adapt to climate impacts that are now \r\nunavoidable and to build sources of clean energy, to say \r\n6/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nnothing of the 0.7 per cent gross domestic product goal \r\nfor development aid.\r\nI know that we, as an international community, face \r\nnumerous crises on many fronts and that much is being \r\nasked of us. But I strongly believe that it is in times \r\nlike these that solutions to even the most intractable \r\nproblems emerge from the human spirit. It is in times \r\nlike these that light emerges from darkness; hope from \r\ndespair.\r\nThe small island developing States have laid out a \r\nvision to help us reach our full potential. I invite our \r\npartners to invest in our peoples, and we will build \r\na better and more secure world. The United Nations \r\nremains our best hope for people everywhere to live \r\nin peace and prosperity. My faith in it has never been \r\nstronger. God bless the Republic of Nauru and God \r\nbless the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Nauru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., \r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPalau.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Tommy Esang Remengesau \r\nJr., President of the Republic of Palau, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Remengesau: Without trying to be \r\nmelodramatic, I believe that my country, the Pacific \r\nregion and the world have reached a crossroads. In \r\nthis International Year of Small Island Developing \r\nStates, leading up to the climate change negotiations \r\nat the twentieth and twenty-first Conferences of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, the third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development and the impending \r\nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda, viewed \r\nwithin the context of our rising oceans, the Ebola crisis \r\nin Africa and the apparent societal inferno in progress \r\nin the Arab world, we find our societies, our cultures \r\nand our economies under serious attack, never before \r\nexperienced on so many fronts. We can continue \r\nbusiness as usual along our current course and wait for \r\nthe horizons to clear the global haze or we can choose a \r\ndifferent road, one that will give our critical habitats the \r\nchance to recover and thereby ensure their continued \r\nability to sustain us. Am I a foolish dreamer or a simple \r\npragmatist? I guess that only time will tell.\r\nHowever, I will say one thing. My country, small \r\nas it is, will not go down without a fight, using every \r\navailable tool, nor will the Pacific region, whose people \r\ncomprehend first-hand the real and current impacts \r\nof climate change and recognize that their oceans are \r\nbecoming polluted and their fish stocks depleted. That \r\nis why the Pacific leaders at this year’s Pacific Islands \r\nForum supported the Palau Declaration under the \r\ntheme “The ocean: life and future”. Within that theme \r\nand Declaration, the Pacific leaders highlighted the fact \r\nthat, in order to survive, we will have to continue to play \r\na central role in the stewardship of one of the greatest \r\nendowments of the world — the Pacific Ocean. That is \r\nbecause, in our short lifetime, we have experienced a \r\ndangerous combination of human impacts that threaten \r\nthe foundation of our Pacific livelihoods.\r\nThat is why we have called on the global community \r\nto support the efforts of the Forum countries to \r\nsustainably use their ocean resources and to conserve \r\ntheir valuable underwater heritage. That is why Palau, \r\nKiribati, the Cook Islands, New Caledonia, the United \r\nStates of America, the Federated States of Micronesia and \r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands are currently in the \r\nprocess of declaring and establishing protected marine \r\nareas of different sizes and requirements to reverse \r\nthe current trends of overuse and overexploitation and \r\nthereby ensure a healthy ocean for our children.\r\nThat is why we are committed to ensuring the launch \r\nof negotiations by September 2015 for an international \r\nagreement under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction. That is why we are calling upon \r\nthe United Nations to ensure a stand-alone sustainable \r\ndevelopment goal (SDG) on oceans.\r\nHowever, while we are strongly in favour of that \r\ncritical SDG, we are concerned that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment dialogue may be too broad. We must \r\n14-54929 7/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nremember that an agenda of everything is effectively \r\nan agenda of nothing. Above all, our goals and targets \r\nmust be realistic, practical, simple, transparent and \r\nmeasurable. In that context, we must continue to focus \r\non the vulnerable countries and the people most in need. \r\nTo accomplish that objective, we must recognize that \r\none size does not fit all and that we must continue to \r\nconcentrate on a common but differentiated response.\r\nOur international community has years of \r\nexperience of what does and does not work with our \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is now time to \r\ncomplete the work on the remaining half and to continue \r\nto improve both the level and the responsiveness of our \r\nfinancing mechanisms. We must also ensure that the \r\nbulk of the financing reaches those that need it most \r\nand that their share is not a mere drop in the bucket.\r\nIn the Pacific, we believe action must begin \r\nin one’s own backyard. In my country, in the next \r\nseveral months, we will formalize the establishment \r\nof a national marine sanctuary, which will include a \r\ncomplete prohibition on purse seine fishing that covers \r\n100 per cent of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ), \r\na “no-take” marine sanctuary that covers 80 per cent \r\nof the Palau EEZ; a highly regulated fishing zone that \r\ncovers approximately 20 per cent of the EEZ and will \r\nprovide for Palau’s domestic fishing needs alone; and a \r\nprohibition on commercial fish exports. Through our \r\nglobal actions and our partnerships between developing \r\nand developed nations and between the private and \r\nthe public sectors, we can achieve a transformational \r\nshift in the way we think about the use of our Earth’s \r\nnatural assets. By recognizing the ocean as a joint and \r\nprimary asset of every citizen on our planet, we can \r\nmove towards the global management of our global \r\nocean exclusive economic zone.\r\nMr. Aslov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nWe must never shift from the need for a global \r\nclimate change initiative that addresses the threat to \r\nall people of all nations. Climate change is our planet’s \r\nsilent war. It must not remain on the back pages of our \r\nminds and our global commitments. We must move it \r\nto the front page, alongside global conflicts, so that it \r\nreceives the attention and the financing that it deserves. \r\nAnd we must understand that, in terms of public health, \r\nclimate change is a defining issue for our century.\r\nClimate change affects the air that we breathe, \r\nthe food that we eat, the water that we drink and \r\nthe infectious diseases that find their way into our \r\nhomes. Our world leaders, whether from developed or \r\ndeveloping countries, must overcome the failures of our \r\nown lost generation. As the Secretary-General said, the \r\nrace is on, and now is the time for leaders to step up and \r\nsteer the world towards a safer future. A temperature \r\nincrease of 3.6 degrees is simply not acceptable. If that \r\nis the best objective that our global leaders can agree \r\non, we may as well throw in the towel and stop having \r\nchildren, because there will be no future for them.\r\nBy the end of 2015, our global leaders must \r\nannounce a new direction with new and realistic \r\ncommitments and practical actions, supported by \r\na greatly enhanced financial commitment both to \r\nmitigation and to adaptation. Those commitments must \r\ninclude the ratification of the second amendment to \r\nthe Kyoto Protocol. Within our discussions, migration \r\nshould not be an option. As the young mother Kathy \r\nJetnil-Kijiner from the Marshall Islands put it so \r\nbeautifully on Tuesday, “No one is moving. No one is \r\nlosing their homeland. No one is becoming a climate \r\nchange refugee”.\r\nOur small island nations, which are the first to \r\nfeel the impacts of climate change, the first to feel the \r\nimpacts of diminished marine resources and the first to \r\nwet our feet in sea-level rise, are ready and willing to \r\nlead. We do not call for action from developed nations \r\nthat we are not willing to take ourselves. Last year, my \r\ncountry committed, under the Majuro Declaration for \r\nClimate Leadership, to a 20 per cent contribution of \r\nrenewable energy to the energy mix and a 30 per cent \r\nreduction in energy consumption by 2020. We are well \r\non the way to achieving those goals.\r\nSince its independence, Palau has been blessed \r\nwith strong partnerships. For over 50 years, the United \r\nStates has provided its support and friendship. Without \r\nits support to Palau’s transition, revenue independence \r\nand infrastructure development, we would not be where \r\nwe are today. Palau stands strongly behind the United \r\nStates in its ongoing efforts to guide the international \r\nresponse to the horrific situation in Syria and Iraq \r\nand its actions to respond to the threat of the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and Sham. Let us not forget that global \r\npeace and stability are critical if we are to achieve \r\nour development agenda and respond to the issues of \r\nclimate change and ocean regeneration.\r\nWe wish to give special thanks for President \r\nObama’s support for oceans and the expressed intent \r\nto set aside 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine \r\n8/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nprotected areas. Finally, we thank the United States for \r\npast and future technical and financial assistance in our \r\nefforts to implement our National Marine Sanctuary. \r\nWe continue to look forward to finally completing our \r\nCompact of Free Association agreement, which reflects \r\nthis close and special relationship.\r\nPalau would also like to acknowledge the very \r\nsignificant economic support that we have received \r\nover the years from our good friend, Japan. We are \r\nhopeful that the Security Council expansion and reform \r\nprocess will result in Japan’s permanent membership \r\non the Security Council. We also are hopeful that Japan \r\nwill continue to support and enhance public and private \r\nassistance to our exclusive economic zone surveillance \r\nefforts and our continued efforts to develop our National \r\nMarine Sanctuary.\r\nIn addition, Palau would like to thank the Republic \r\nof China on Taiwan for its friendship and economic \r\nsupport in assisting Palau to achieve our Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and would urge the United Nations \r\nsystem to involve Taiwan in the process of developing \r\nand implementing the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nI would also call upon the United Nations to support \r\nTaiwan’s broader participation in the United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies and regional economic integration \r\nmechanisms, as its participation in the World \r\nHealth Assembly, the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement \r\nand the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership \r\nwould demonstrate its ability to contribute to global \r\nand regional initiatives.\r\nWe also would like to express our thanks to the \r\nAustralian Government for its ongoing partnership, \r\nits annual aid assistance focused on education and \r\nits commitment to providing $2 billion to the Pacific \r\nregion to replace its aging marine surveillance f leet.\r\nFinally, we would like to recognize the very broad \r\nlist of partners around the globe that make our efforts \r\nto ensure a sustainable future possible, including New \r\nZealand, the European Union, private organizations, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society. \r\nPartnerships such as those are commitments. We would \r\nnot be where we are today without them. In the post-\r\n2015 development environment, we must all recognize \r\nthat our actions as individuals, States, nations and \r\nregions have an impact on all our partners on planet \r\nEarth. If we are to save our oceans and if we are to stem \r\nthe tide of greenhouse gases, we must establish a long-\r\nlasting system of global partnerships and respect.\r\nAt the end of the day, we must recognize that some \r\nof us are developed and some of us are not. The means \r\nof implementation in terms of oceans, climate change, \r\nbiodiversity and all of the other issues that require global \r\nsolutions are therefore a recurring and central issue. \r\nWithout effective partnerships, change will simply not \r\noccur, and without legally binding commitments with \r\nrespect toour oceans and climate change, we will not \r\nmake the transformative changes that we need to make \r\nin the next generation.\r\nAs a small island developing State and a member of \r\nthe Pacific community, I am ready, willing and able to \r\ncommit to doing my share. I am even willing to lead. \r\nBut let us not fool ourselves. The only way to make a \r\ndifference in this modem global era is to go beyond our \r\nself-centred mentality. By standing together, we can \r\nindeed craft a sustainable future for our children and \r\nfor generations to come.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Palau for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the United Republic \r\nof Tanzania.\r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kikwete: I congratulate my brother Sam \r\nKutesa of the Republic of Uganda on his well-deserved \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session. While wishing him every success \r\nin the discharge of his duties and responsibilities, \r\nmy delegation and I promise him our full support \r\n14-54929 9/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nand cooperation. Allow me also to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, \r\nfor his remarkable leadership of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-eighth session.\r\nOur illustrious Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\ndeserves praise and appreciation for his leadership \r\nand the good work he is doing for our esteemed \r\nOrganization. He has been performing his duty with \r\ncourage, dedication, passion and commitment in \r\ndriving the United Nations agenda. We will always be \r\ngrateful to him.\r\nWe welcome and fully endorse the theme of this \r\nyear’s debate, “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”. \r\nWe expect the discussion on it to make important \r\ncontributions in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nabout to start on the post-2015 development goals. As \r\nwe dedicate our time and effort to the negotiations on \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, we must not lose \r\nsight of the unfinished business of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). It is important that \r\nany unaccomplished targets and indicators should be \r\nproperly factored into the new agenda. In the meantime, \r\nwe should ensure that we use the remaining 461 days to \r\naccelerate the pace of implementing the MDGs.\r\nThe issue of financing the implementation of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda must be given \r\nspecial attention. I am mentioning this matter because \r\nexperience has taught us that, other factors aside, we \r\nwill fall short of attaining a number of the MDG targets \r\nand indicators because of unpredictable, unreliable, \r\ninsufficient and untimely availability of financial \r\nresources. Therefore, for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda to be achieved, we must devise a mechanism \r\nto ensure stable, predictable and reliable sources of \r\nfinance for their implementation.\r\nThere is more to the year 2015 than the deadline for \r\nthe MDGs and the onset of the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. The year 2015 is also a deadline \r\nfor the world to conclude a legally binding climate \r\nchange agreement. We thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor convening the Climate Summit that took place on \r\n23 September, here at the United Nations. It afforded \r\nus a unique opportunity to put our minds together and \r\ndeliberate on ways to save this planet from disaster and \r\nadvance on clean development pathways. It was very \r\nopportune, indeed, to hold the Summit two months \r\nbefore the twentieth Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (COP-20), which is due to be held in Lima in \r\nDecember 2014, and one year before COP-21, to be held \r\nin Paris next year. In many ways, the Summit may help \r\nto make the work in Peru less difficult. As members \r\nknow, a successful Lima Conference will mean a lot \r\nin terms of the Paris Conference, where we expect \r\nto conclude a legally binding climate agreement. We \r\nknow it is not easy, but Tanzania and Africa as a whole \r\nare appealing to all countries from all continents to do \r\nwhatever it takes to ensure that COP-21 delivers on the \r\nexpectations all of us have. Failure should not be an \r\noption.\r\nUnited Nations reforms are long overdue. Reports \r\nthat consultations and negotiations are not showing \r\nencouraging signs of progress are very frustrating \r\nindeed. We should remain steadfast and vigilant and not \r\nallow the momentum to be lost. We humbly request the \r\nPresident of the Assembly to use his good offices and \r\nlong-standing diplomatic skills to revitalize the process \r\nand keep it on track. We must keep the f lame burning.\r\nGlobal peace and security are in a state of f lux. \r\nThe events occurring in North Africa, the Middle \r\nEast, Eastern Europe, the Great Lakes region and the \r\nHorn of Africa are matters of concern to all of us. \r\nEqually important is the menace of terrorism; the illicit \r\nexploitation of natural resources; poaching; and the \r\nillicit trade in narcotic drugs and weapons, which are \r\nmaking the world less secure.\r\nTerrorism is assuming new dimensions, making \r\nit a huge threat today because of its indiscriminate, \r\nlethal and callous character. Hundreds of innocent \r\npeople have lost their lives or been abducted, with \r\nfatal consequences. No country is insulated from this \r\nmenace, and nobody is safe. As such, it calls for all of \r\nus to play an active role in the fight against terrorism \r\nand cross-border crime. Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other terrorist \r\norganizations should not be allowed to have their way. \r\nLibya should not be left to disintegrate. The senseless \r\nfighting in the Central African Republic and South \r\nSudan must be brought to an end. This world, under \r\nthe leadership of the Security Council and regional \r\norganizations, has the capacity to do exactly that. Let \r\nus do what is required of us to stop the bloodshed, loss \r\nof life, suffering of innocent people and destruction of \r\nproperty.\r\nThe horrifying scenes of bombings and the \r\ndeaths of innocent women, children and men in the \r\nrecent hostilities between Israel and Palestine are \r\n10/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nheartbreaking. Unfortunately, the conflict has been \r\ngoing on for far too long, despite the fact that the \r\nlasting solution is known: two States, living side by \r\nside harmoniously. That solution has been elusive. The \r\ntime has now come for the United Nations, the United \r\nStates of America, Russia, Europe and other global and \r\nregional Powers to come together in concerted efforts \r\nto make it happen. We should not wait any longer.\r\nAs regards the question of Western Sahara, let me \r\nreiterate the appeal I made last year to the Security \r\nCouncil to do everything in its power to resolve that \r\nproblem once and for all. Honestly, I cannot comprehend \r\nwhy that problem, which began around the same time as \r\nthat in East Timor, nearly 40 years ago, should remain \r\nunresolved to this day. What are the insurmountable \r\nchallenges impeding the United Nations from ending \r\nthe impasse? I ask the United Nations to please do what \r\nis needed and put the Sahrawi question to rest. I know \r\nit can.\r\nOnce again, we in Tanzania wish to join others who \r\nspoke before us in calling for an end to the sanctions \r\nand embargo against Cuba and its people. For over 50 \r\nyears, the embargo has condemned the people of Cuba, \r\nincluding innocent children and women, to perpetual \r\nhardship and poverty. It is high time that the embargo \r\nbe lifted and the people of Cuba given the opportunity \r\nto live in dignity like everybody else on this planet.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is being held \r\nat a time when our brothers and sisters in Liberia, Sierra \r\nLeone and Guinea are confronting the worst outbreak \r\nof the deadly Ebola epidemic to date. In those three \r\ncountries, together with Nigeria and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, some 2,400 people have lost \r\ntheir lives. The disease, which has no cure or vaccine \r\nas yet, presents a major threat to the countries where \r\nthe disease is known to exist, but also to neighbouring \r\ncountries and beyond. Unless the world succeeds in \r\ncontrolling the spread of this disease, there is every \r\nlikelihood that it will become a global epidemic.\r\nOur collective efforts in that regard are the best \r\nway forward. I believe the world has the technology, \r\nknowledge and financial resources that, if put together, \r\ncan defeat the threat posed by Ebola. We should also \r\ncontinue to support the efforts of the world’s scientists, \r\nwho are working tirelessly, day and night, in search \r\nof a cure and a vaccine. We applaud the efforts being \r\nundertaken by the United Nations, the World Health \r\nOrganization, the United States Government and other \r\ncountries with the necessary technical and technological \r\ncapabilities to assist the affected countries and wage \r\nthe fight against the disease worldwide\r\nWe request four things. First, we must continue and, \r\nwhere possible, bolster that support until the spread of \r\nthe disease is under control. Secondly, we must continue \r\nto assist other nations in West Africa and elsewhere on \r\nthe African continent in building their capacities for \r\nsurveillance, isolation and treatment. Thirdly, we must \r\nintensify our efforts to develop a cure and a vaccine \r\nto save the lives of those infected now and to prevent \r\nothers from being infected. Fourthly and finally, we \r\nmust help Africa; we must help African nations so that \r\nthe stigma that is developing against Africa because of \r\nEbola is stopped.\r\nReports that a number of people from other \r\ncontinents are now shying away from coming to Africa \r\nand are cancelling travel plans because of Ebola are \r\ndisturbing. That is threatening to kill the all-important \r\ntourism industry, trade and investment f lows to Africa. \r\nMay the United Nations and friends of Africa please \r\nhelp us to tell the world that Africa is a continent of \r\n54 countries, not a country of 54 provinces. Not all \r\ncountries in Africa have the disease. Moreover, many \r\ncountries are far away from the concerned countries in \r\nWest Africa. In fact, the affected countries are closer \r\nto Europe than they are to Kenya, Tanzania or South \r\nAfrica in eastern and southern Africa, to mention but a \r\nfew. As a matter of fact, they are 9 to 11 hours away by \r\nair from those countries. To cancel travel to our parts \r\nof Africa is incomprehensible and a gross injustice to \r\nthe continent.\r\nI am confident that this seven-day debate on \r\nthe theme “Delivering on and implementing a \r\ntransformative post-2015 development agenda” affords \r\nus another opportunity to define a bright future for \r\nourselves, our children, our children’s children and their \r\ngrandchildren. We should seize the moment to build on \r\nthe success stories and lessons from the many countries \r\nand peoples who have been successful. We should \r\nalso learn from the challenges and failures during the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs in conceiving the goals, \r\ntargets and indicators of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Tanzania stands ready to cooperate with the \r\nrest of the Members of the United Nations family in \r\nbuilding consensus on the post-2015 development goals.\r\nAllow me to conclude by appealing to everyone in \r\nthis Hall to promise to work for a post-2015 development \r\nagenda that will make the world a better place for all of \r\nus to live in.\r\n14-54929 11/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister \r\nof Canada\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Stephen Harper, Prime \r\nMinister of Canada, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Harper (Canada) (spoke in French): It is both \r\nan honour and a pleasure for me to once again address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFor more than 70 years, Canada has supported the \r\nUnited Nations and its institutions in the pursuit of \r\nworld peace. On many occasions Canadians have put \r\ntheir lives on the line to deter active conflict between \r\npeoples. It is a duty we accept and it is a record of which \r\nwe are proud.\r\nToday, there are many embattled parts of the world \r\nwhere the suffering of the local populations and the \r\nthreats to global security deserve our urgent attention, \r\nand I could easily use my entire time here on any one \r\nof them. There are, however, other areas of service to \r\nhumankind. It is to some of those that I wish to speak \r\ntonight, for there is more to peace than the absence of \r\nwar. Where human misery abounds, where grinding \r\npoverty is the rule, where justice is systematically \r\ndenied, there is no real peace — only the seeds of \r\nfuture conflict. \r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOf course, misery and injustice are not the only \r\nroots of war. We need only look at the world today to \r\nappreciate that.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThen we understand how the worst of human \r\nnature — perverse ideologies, religious extremism and \r\nthe lust for power and plunder — can rob people in so \r\nmany places of property, hope and life itself. That is \r\nwhy Canada has always been ready and willing to join \r\nwith other civilized peoples and to challenge affronts to \r\nthe international order, affronts to human dignity itself, \r\nsuch as those that are today present in Eastern Europe, \r\nparticularly Ukraine, in the Middle East — Iraq, Syria \r\nand elsewhere — and of course many parts of Africa.\r\nCanada’s positions on those issues are well known, \r\nand we will continue to contribute to the extent to \r\nwhich we are able in assisting our friends and allies \r\nin the international community to deal with those \r\ngrave challenges. But while those extreme situations \r\nare being confronted, other problems — pandemics, \r\nclimate change and, of course, the problems of \r\nunderdevelopment — remain.  \r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAnd we feel strongly that no effort is ever in vain \r\nif it offers peoples an alternative to conflict and the \r\npossibility of a better life for them and their families.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanadians therefore seek a world where freedom, \r\ndemocracy, human rights and the rule of law are \r\nrespected. We hold those things to be intrinsically right \r\nand good. We also believe that they are the necessary \r\nfoundation for a better world for more people and are \r\nnecessary for prosperity. With prosperity comes hope, \r\nand with hope, the greater inclination of free peoples \r\neverywhere to find peaceful solutions to the things \r\nthat divide them. Indeed, we believe that freedom, \r\nprosperity and peace form a virtuous circle. \r\nFor that reason, the growth of trade among nations \r\nand the delivery of effective development assistance to \r\nordinary people — simple, practical aid — are the things \r\nthat have become the signatures of our Government’s \r\noutreach in the world. Trade means jobs, growth and \r\nopportunities. It has made great nations out of small \r\nones. The story of my own country, Canada, is a case in \r\npoint. Historically, trade has built our country, just as \r\ntoday it is reshaping our world. Trade means ordinary \r\npeople can support their families and even dare to \r\ndream of something much more.\r\n12/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOur Government has worked hard to establish a \r\nvast network of modern trade agreements.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe trade agreements we have concluded tear down \r\nthe barriers of tariff and excise and enlarge markets and \r\nopportunities for buyers and sellers alike. Canada has \r\nnow established such links with countries that today \r\npossess more than a quarter of the world’s people and \r\nnearly half the world’s business. And our free-trade \r\nnetwork will grow larger yet. It is not, by the way, an \r\nexclusive club for wealthy nations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCanada has already liberalized its trade with \r\ncountries better known for their determination to \r\nsucceed than for the size of their economies, thereby \r\nopening the way for them to access Canadian and other \r\nmarkets. We have no reason to stop now. As indicated \r\nby my colleague from Senegal, President Macky Sall, \r\n“Aid is needed for development, but what is needed \r\neven more is investment”. He is quite right.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nYet no matter how freely we trade, millions of \r\npeople will need a helping hand for some time to come. \r\nEasily the most important example, and the one closest \r\nto my heart, is the worldwide struggle upon which \r\nso many of you have been engaged, in the maternal, \r\nnewborn and child health initiative. Saving the lives \r\nof the world’s most vulnerable mothers, infants and \r\nchildren must remain a top global priority. That is, the \r\nworld must honour the commitments made in this very \r\nHall to mothers and children in the year 2000. And \r\nthere has been remarkable progress.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThanks to inexpensive vaccines and the combined \r\nefforts of multiple partners, more children are \r\nbeing vaccinated today than ever before. And as the \r\nimportance of nutrition becomes better understood, \r\nmore and more children are surviving. Thanks to \r\nsimple, low-cost, easily accessible techniques, literally \r\nmillions of mothers and children who a mere 14 years \r\nago might have died not only survive today, but thrive.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI think especially of the 2010 meeting of world \r\nleaders at Muskoka, which raised about $7.5 billion \r\ndollars, $2 billion of it from private donors. Based on \r\nthat, the United Nations launched what the Secretary-\r\nGeneral called the “Every woman, every child” initiative, \r\nwith the goal of saving 16 million lives by 2016. An \r\nimportant aspect of that work has been monitoring \r\nboth the receipt of monies pledged and how they are \r\nused. The assurance of full accountability has allowed \r\nrecipients to plan with greater certainty and donors to \r\ngive with confidence. With His Excellency President \r\nKikwete of Tanzania, whom we have just heard, it was \r\nmy honour to co-chair the World Health Organization’s \r\nInformation and Accountability Commission linked to \r\nthat initiative.\r\nOn this, we have a clear vision, and that vision is \r\nachievable. We know how to help a great many of those \r\nvulnerable people. We have seen what can be done. We \r\nwant simply to rally the passion and the will to make it \r\nhappen. We are preventing deaths, and we can prevent \r\nmore — deaths of thousands of children every day from \r\neasily preventable causes. We can stop the thousands \r\nof mothers dying in childbirth who would survive \r\nwith relatively little intervention. We also know who \r\nwe need to be working with — new partnerships that \r\nbring together Governments and agencies of the United \r\nNations, including the World Health Organization, the \r\nWorld Food Programme and UNICEF, with the private \r\nsector, partnerships that are producing real results and \r\ntaking us to new heights of excellence.\r\nHere I am thinking of the Maternal, Newborn \r\nand Child Health Network in Canada, a group that \r\nrepresents a broad base of Canadian civil society and \r\nis a key implementing partner on the ground. As many \r\nrepresentatives know, in May in Toronto, Canada hosted \r\nthe world’s leading actors on that subject. We heard \r\nthe success stories — for example, the Micronutrient \r\nInitiative through which 180 million children received \r\nvitamin A, pills that cost pennies but drop child \r\nmortality by 25 per cent. We heard about the Global \r\nAlliance for Vaccines and Immunization and how \r\nduring the three-year period  between 2010 and 2013, \r\nimmunizations saved the lives of 2 million children.\r\nWe have partnerships to deliver better nutrition and \r\npartnerships to deliver better measurement, because \r\nvital statistics are critical. One cannot manage what \r\none cannot measure. And in that mission, we measure \r\nprogress in precious lives saved. So every child needs \r\na birth certificate.\r\n14-54929 13/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe also heard that in the world today is a greater \r\nobligation with regard to accountability, not only with \r\nregard to the vast sums of money pledged, but also the \r\nway in which that money is spent.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nSo our consensus was clear. We have seen success, \r\nand we have momentum. Saving the lives of children \r\nand mothers is a fight we can win. To get it done, two \r\nthings are needed now: political focus and renewed \r\nfinancial commitment. I therefore urge the Assembly, in \r\nthe strongest terms, to ensure that, maternal, newborn \r\nand child health remains a clear and top priority in the \r\nevolving post-2015 development agenda — and one \r\nof a limited number of priorities. That is the political \r\nfocus we need. Then there is the financial commitment. \r\nI know we all have many competing priorities. But we \r\nhave come so far that to stop now would be a tragedy.\r\nI must say I was very encouraged this afternoon \r\nat the Secretary-General’s “Every woman, every child” \r\nevent, when President Kim of the World Bank and other \r\nleaders announced new financing for the Bank’s Global \r\nFinancing Facility for Every Woman Every Child. \r\nThat Facility will help developing countries access the \r\nfinancing required to improve their health systems. I \r\nwas pleased to announce that Canada would financially \r\nsupport the World Bank’s Global Financing Facility for \r\nEvery Woman Every Child. \r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe urge other countries to do likewise because \r\nto provide viable solutions to prevent the tragic death \r\nof women and children, we need to increase budget \r\nallocations on the part of both donors and the developing \r\ncountries.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn closing, let me just say this. There are many \r\nindividual countries and many specific causes that will \r\nrightly occupy our deliberations here this week. Let us \r\nalso not forget to look beyond those crises at the long-\r\nterm opportunities and efforts that can truly transform \r\nthe world. We have it in our power to create a better \r\nkind of world for our children’s children than the one \r\nwe have today.\r\nAnd we should, for it was never the intention of the \r\nfounders of the United Nations — Canada being one \r\nof them — that ours would be a world where terrorists \r\ncould get the resources necessary to sow death and \r\ndestruction but where workers and families could \r\nnot get jobs and opportunities, or where mothers and \r\nchildren could not obtain the necessities required to \r\nlive and thrive.\r\nThe world that Canada strives for is the world that \r\nthe founders of the United Nations wanted from the \r\nbeginning, as boldly articulated in their Declaration \r\nof 1 January 1942 — a world where “life, liberty, \r\nindependence and religious freedom” are defended, \r\nwhere “human rights and justice” are preserved, and \r\nwhere all join “in a common struggle against savage and \r\nbrutal forces seeking to subjugate the world”. In such \r\na world, there can be prosperity for the impoverished, \r\njustice for the weak and, for the desperate, that most \r\nprecious of all things, hope.\r\nIt is easy to look at the many problems of the world \r\ntoday and become despondent. Yet for all our failings, \r\nthere has been, for most of humankind, tremendous \r\nprogress in my lifetime. Therefore, I am enough of an \r\noptimist to think that because we can create a more \r\nprosperous, fairer and hopeful world, not only should \r\nwe, but indeed, I believe we will find the will to do so.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Canada \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Stephen Harper, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Mark Rutte, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for General Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Rutte (Netherlands): On 17 July, in a summer \r\nalready marked by alarming reports from Syria, \r\nIraq and Gaza, our country was confronted with a \r\n14/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nstark international reality. The 298 passengers of \r\nFlight MH-17 would be alive today if not for the Crimea \r\nconflict and the destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Of \r\nthose victims, 196 were Dutch nationals.\r\nThat tragedy has had an enormous impact on \r\nour country — so many innocent men, women and \r\nchildren, entire families ripped from neighbourhoods, \r\nempty desks in offices and schools, teammates gone \r\nforever. Everyone in the Netherlands knew someone in \r\nthat plane, directly or indirectly, and we will feel the \r\npain for years to come. Some of the victims still have \r\nnot been identified, and that must be done as soon as \r\npossible. Nothing is more important to their loved ones, \r\nwherever in the world they may be.\r\nThis summer we were reminded again of how \r\nclosely interwoven events at home and abroad can be \r\nand how important a stable world order is to our national \r\ninterests. We saw again that when it comes to addressing \r\nthe major problems facing the global community, there \r\nis simply no alternative to working together. That is the \r\nfirm conviction of the Dutch Government.\r\nWe are grateful for the wide support for Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2166 (2014). All remains and personal \r\nbelongings must be repatriated. The cause of the Flight \r\nMH-17 disaster must be brought to light, and those \r\nresponsible must be brought to justice. Unhindered \r\naccess to the crash site is therefore essential. The Dutch \r\nGovernment is fully committed to achieving those \r\ngoals, working with all the countries and organizations \r\ninvolved.\r\nThe Constitution of the Netherlands contains a \r\nunique article that says, “The Government shall promote \r\nthe development of the international legal order”. That \r\nself-imposed responsibility comes from a long tradition \r\nof freedom, respect for the rule of law and our country’s \r\ninternational orientation. In March, we put that principle \r\ninto practice once again when we hosted the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Summit, a conference on an important topic \r\nthat must remain high on the international agenda. The \r\nevents of this summer have made us even more resolute \r\nabout promoting the international legal order and about \r\nworking to that end with everyone here in the General \r\nAssembly, in the knowledge that peace, justice and \r\ndevelopment are closely interconnected.\r\nThe year 2015 is an important one for the global \r\ndevelopment agenda. We will be reviewing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and raising the \r\nbar once again. In July this year, the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals laid a solid \r\nfoundation for the future that reflects the Netherlands’ \r\npriorities. The most important goal is to eradicate \r\nextreme poverty within a generation in a way that \r\ndoes not harm economic growth, social equality or the \r\nenvironment. We must link short-term goals with long-\r\nterm goals.\r\nDespite the progress made, we know that fragile \r\nStates, where the rule of law barely exists, had no \r\nchance of achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. In 2013 there were more displaced people in \r\nconflict regions than ever before. For those reasons, \r\nthe Netherlands applauds the Open Working Group’s \r\nintention to include peace and the rule of law in the new \r\nframework.\r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s announced \r\nintention to establish the United Nations Mission for \r\nEbola Emergency Response. The Netherlands will \r\nsubstantially increase its humanitarian aid. Part of that \r\neffort is a new contribution of €18 million to the fight \r\nagainst Ebola.\r\nIn the same vein, the Netherlands will continue to \r\nsupport and participate in United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions. We currently have military personnel and \r\nrelief workers serving in Mali, South Sudan and \r\nelsewhere. The upcoming review of peacekeeping \r\nmissions is an opportunity to improve the instrument \r\nand make it more effective. The Netherlands believes \r\nthat major progress can be made on that front by further \r\nintegrating the three Ds: defence, development and \r\ndiplomacy.\r\nOur commitment to fulfilling Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) remains firm too, because \r\nwomen’s leadership is essential to achieving peace and \r\nsecurity. The important role that women play as change \r\nagents in politics, economic development and society \r\ncannot be emphasized enough.\r\nAs host country to many international legal \r\ninstitutions, including the International Court of Justice \r\nand the International Criminal Court, the Netherlands \r\nfeels a special responsibility with respect to international \r\nlaw. When innocent people fall victim to impunity, \r\nhuman rights violations and the violence of war, the \r\ninternational community cannot and should not just \r\nstand by and just watch. Perpetrators must be brought \r\nto justice, however complex and time-consuming the \r\nprocess may be. We owe this not only to the passengers \r\nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, but also to the \r\n14-54929 15/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nvictims of violence in Syria and in Iraq. The horrifying \r\nimages of mass executions and beheadings in the region \r\nare burned into our memories. They impress upon \r\nus how important it is for the Security Council and \r\ninternational legal institutions to be able to act boldly \r\nand decisively.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands, a partner for \r\npeace, justice and development, is a candidate for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council in 2017 \r\nand 2018. We want to help modernize and strengthen \r\nthat important United Nations body. Renewal is \r\nneeded to ensure its effectiveness and legitimacy. The \r\nSecurity Council must be able to act in a crisis. When \r\nmass atrocities are being committed somewhere in the \r\nworld, veto power should be exercised with greater \r\nrestraint. We salute the French initiative in that regard. \r\nWe also believe that the Security Council’s authority \r\nand resolve would be enhanced if the United Nations \r\nMember States were more broadly represented. That \r\nis especially true of the African States which, in our \r\nopinion, are underrepresented.\r\nIn closing, Dag Hammarskjöld once said that\r\n“[t]he principles of the Charter are, by far, greater \r\nthan the Organization in which they are embodied, \r\nand the aims which they are to safeguard are holier \r\nthan the policies of any single nation or people” \r\n(S/PV.751, para. 4).\r\nThe Netherlands shares that conviction and remains \r\nsteadfast in its commitment to promoting the \r\ninternational legal order, as our Constitution demands.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for General Affairs of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nGeneral Affairs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Qohir Rasulzoda, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Tajikistan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Qohir Rasulzoda, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Qohir Rasulzoda, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Tajikistan, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Rasulzoda (Tajikistan) (spoke in Russian): It is \r\nmy great pleasure to endorse the warm congratulations \r\nextended to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the \r\nresponsible post of President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. I take this opportunity to \r\nexpress gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his important \r\ncontribution to the work of the General Assembly at its \r\nprior session.\r\nMy delegation shares the determination to \r\neradicate hunger and poverty and to promote progress \r\nin elaborating the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nIn our view, the post-2015 development agenda must \r\nbe based on the foundation of the development goals \r\nformulated in the Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2) and envisage ways and means of responding to the \r\nchallenges of a new generation.\r\nThe main goal of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nshould be the eradication of poverty and inequality, \r\nas well as promoting sustainable development based \r\non balanced consideration of social, economic and \r\nenvironmental factors. The sustainable development \r\ngoals, based on the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the Rio de Janeiro principles and national \r\nspecificities and priorities, should serve as the key \r\ncomponents of the post-2015 development agenda. In \r\nthat respect, we support the recommendations of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Experience has shown that a goal can be \r\nachieved only if specific plans are complemented by \r\nthe development of effective mechanisms for its review \r\nand implementation. Our hope is that this forum will \r\nbecome an important venue for ongoing dialogue \r\nand review of the implementation of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nAddressing issues concerning the financing \r\nof sustainable development efforts is equally \r\nimportant in achieving sustainable development. \r\nGlobal partnerships for development based on the \r\nMillennium Declaration have contributed to a certain \r\nextent towards the achievement of a number of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). However, \r\ngaps and f laws in global partnerships continue to cause \r\nadditional difficulties on the path towards full and \r\ntimely implementation of the MDGs.\r\n16/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nWe consider it necessary to strengthen and expand \r\nglobal partnerships in accordance with previous \r\ncommitments. On that basis, new global partnerships \r\nshould be established for the benefit of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which will become the key element of the \r\nglobal system of promoting and advancing sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, we note the key importance \r\nof the recommendations of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing, the intergovernmental process tasked with \r\ndiscussing proposals to establish a United Nations \r\nmechanism to promote development and technology \r\ntransfer.\r\nTajikistan has consistently strengthened its efforts \r\nto achieve the MDGs. Extra measures have been \r\nundertaken to create a favourable investment climate, \r\nincluding a balanced budget policy, diversifying the \r\neconomy and increasing employment opportunities.\r\nThe National Development Strategy of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan up to 2015 is a road map for the Government \r\nto achieve sustainable economic growth, to provide the \r\npopulation with better access to basic social services \r\nand to reduce poverty.\r\nAs a result of such measures to ensure economic \r\ngrowth, in recent years we have managed to significantly \r\nreduce the level of poverty in the country. As a United \r\nNations pilot country for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, we plan to carry out \r\na comprehensive review of the implementation of those \r\nGoals in Tajikistan in 2015. The lessons learned from \r\nthe implementation of the MDGs will be taken into \r\naccount during the development of a new programme of \r\nsustainable development for the period up to 2030. We \r\nare willing to closely cooperate in a transparent way \r\nwith United Nations agencies and programmes, partner \r\ncountries and other relevant organizations.\r\nAs members may be aware, on 22 March 2005, \r\nin New York, we saw the launch of the International \r\nDecade for Action, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, which \r\npromoted the coordinated implementation of the MDGs. \r\nThe International Decade provided a strong impetus \r\nfor various initiatives and efforts at different levels to \r\npromote access to safe drinking water and sanitation, to \r\nadvance the integrated management of water resources, \r\nto strengthen and expand water cooperation and to raise \r\nawareness of water-related challenges.\r\nAt the same time, global climate change, increasing \r\neconomic growth, higher population levels, the \r\ndegradation of water sources and the deteriorating \r\nquality of water resources present the international \r\ncommunity with additional extensive challenges. The \r\nreduction in water resources as a result of climate \r\nchange may impede the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and aggravate the situation, in particular \r\nin arid and semi-arid regions, which continue to \r\nexperience the greatest water shortages.\r\nThe International Year of Water Cooperation, \r\nwhich took place last year in the context of promoting \r\nthe International Decade of Action, “Water for Life”, \r\n2005-2015, underscored the need for water resources \r\nmanagement to be regulated on the basis of the \r\nprinciple of joint development, which provides for a \r\nbroad framework for the harmonization of interests \r\nand the strengthening of mutual trust in addressing \r\nwater issues. On the basis of the principle of joint \r\ndevelopment, water resources management could ensure \r\nthe sustainable management of water resources, which \r\nis a key component of sustainable development. In that \r\nregard, we propose conducting a comprehensive review \r\nof the implementation of the International Decade \r\nof Action, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, and jointly \r\ndeveloping specific recommendations to strengthen \r\nand revitalize the United Nations water agenda.\r\nWe believe access to modern and affordable energy \r\nservices to be a key priority for achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Tajikistan continues to consistently and \r\ncomprehensively develop its energy potential, focusing \r\non the integrated development of renewable sources. \r\nIn addition to the construction of small- and medium-\r\nscale hydropower plants, larger regional projects are \r\nbeing developed. We are also exploring opportunities \r\nfor the use of wind and solar energy. Through such \r\nprojects, Tajikistan is significantly and specifically \r\ncontributing to the reduction of harmful emissions \r\nand to the establishment of a solid foundation for \r\nsustainable development. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to underscore that all those projects are \r\nbeing implemented in a transparent way, with due \r\nconsideration for the social, economic and ecological \r\naspects of the sustainable development of the country \r\nand the entire region.\r\nTajikistan supports the holding of the Ten-Year \r\nReview Conference on the Implementation of the \r\nAlmaty Programme of Action on 3 to 5 November \r\nin Vienna. We believe that the new programme of \r\naction for the landlocked least developed countries \r\nwill provide additional opportunities for the further \r\n14-54929 17/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nintegration of such countries into the world economy. \r\nWe should support and encourage as much as possible \r\nway the efforts of that group of countries to expand \r\nand to improve transport and energy infrastructure, the \r\ndiversification of the economy and the streamlining of \r\nregional and interregional connectivity.\r\nWhile the Organization’s transformative agenda \r\nprovides unique opportunities, unfortunately, it also \r\ntends to strengthen the interlinkage between today’s \r\nthreats and challenges. It is in the common interests of \r\nMember States to consistently implement the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and to \r\neffectively counter terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations, including the use of the Internet for the \r\npurpose of terror.\r\nIllicit drug production and drug trafficking are \r\nalso serious global issues. In recent decades, Tajikistan \r\nhas gained extensive experience in combating drug \r\ntrafficking. Under the country’s President, the Drug \r\nControl Agency has been functioning successfully for \r\n15 years. We have been actively strengthening counter-\r\nnarcotics cooperation with neighbouring States, \r\nincluding within regional organizations. At the initiative \r\nof the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, Emomali \r\nRahmon, Dushanbe will host a regional anti-narcotics \r\nconference in 2015, a year before the special session of \r\nthe General Assembly on the world drug problem. The \r\nproposals of the conference participants will jointly \r\nhelp to develop a new international counter-narcotics \r\npolicy. We look forward to the support of the United \r\nNations, relevant States and international organizations \r\nfor that conference.\r\nIn that regard, we attach great significance to \r\ncoordinated and joint efforts with Afghanistan in \r\ncombating drugs, as well as on other issues. The \r\nfriendly Islamic State of Afghanistan is facing new \r\nchallenges and expects the appropriate support from \r\nthe international community. We are convinced that \r\nthe fraternal Afghan people, with the support of the \r\ncommunity of nations, will be able to successfully \r\naddress the difficulties facing them. We believe that, \r\nin the current circumstances, the United Nations must \r\ntake the lead in coordinating international efforts for \r\nthe resolution of the question of Afghanistan.\r\nTajikistan believes that Afghanistan must be fully \r\ninvolved in the multifaceted regional cooperation \r\nprocess. It is critical to fully include Afghanistan \r\nin the multifaceted regional cooperation processes. \r\nThe involvement of neighbouring countries in the \r\ndevelopment of Afghanistan, while taking into account \r\nthe regional context in the post-conflict rehabilitation \r\nof the country, is key to the success of the ongoing \r\nefforts of the international community.\r\nIn our view, strengthening lasting peace and \r\nstability in conflict and post-conflict situations \r\nrequires genuine assistance in addressing economic \r\nand social issues and support for efforts to restore \r\neffective Government institutions and a sustainable \r\nbasis for long-term development. The regional \r\nmultilateral structures must actively participate in \r\nstrengthening security and stability, in implementing \r\nlarge-scale infrastructure projects and programmes and \r\nin expanding constructive and concrete cooperation \r\nand interaction.\r\nIn early September, Dushanbe, the capital of \r\nTajikistan, hosted the fourteenth summit of the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization (SCO). The heads of the SCO \r\nmember States called for the strengthening of regional \r\ncooperation, joint development and mutual prosperity. \r\nThey adopted measures on the liberalization of trade \r\nand investment and the improvement of transport and \r\ncommunications systems and on ensuring food and \r\nenergy security. They also addressed other urgent \r\nregional issues of fundamental interest to our people.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that it is \r\nimpossible to resolve the issues facing the General \r\nAssembly without strengthening, reforming, \r\nrationalizing and updating the entire United Nations \r\nsystem. Comprehensive reform of the United Nations \r\nshould contribute to its strengthening and the \r\nenhancement of its capacity to respond to the latest \r\ndevelopments in the world in a timely and adequate \r\nmanner and to meet modern challenges and counteract \r\nmodern threats. The current Assembly session provides \r\na unique opportunity for the search of joint coordinated \r\nways of addressing pressing issues, which we need take \r\nfull advantage of.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Qohir Rasulzoda, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\n18/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nAddress by Mr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, \r\nPrime Minister of the Democratic Republic of \r\nTimor-Leste\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister \r\nof the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Kay Rala Xanana \r\nGusmão, Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of \r\nTimor-Leste, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Gusmão (Timor-Leste) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): In September \r\n2000, before becoming an independent country and \r\nwhile under the administration of the United Nations \r\nTransitional Administration in East Timor, we came \r\nto the General Assembly as observers in order to \r\nfamiliarize ourselves with the grand designs for the new \r\ncentury, in the form of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Twelve years after Timor-Leste was \r\nadmitted into this prestigious Organization, here we \r\nare again to take part in a review of what has been done \r\nand of what has not been done, looking at reasons and \r\nimpacts.\r\nUltimately we want to revise the Assembly’s \r\nmanner of operation and redefine plans and strategies. \r\nHowever, other speeches made both here and at the \r\nSecurity Council open debate yesterday (S/PV.7272) \r\nshow the other face — the more troubling one — of world \r\nproblems, which is the general unquietness of spirit and \r\nthe pressure to use force in order to punish. I therefore \r\nadd my voice to all those who spoke before me in \r\nstating my deep concern about the particularly difficult \r\ntime in which the community of nations is living. The \r\nUnited Nations has been the unassailable forum for \r\napproaching international issues and continues to be \r\nthe hope of millions of people throughout the world.\r\nIn the year 2000, the challenges came from the \r\ncondition of extreme poverty, educational deficits, \r\nenormous scarcity in terms of doctors and medication \r\nand lack of food production that affected the populations \r\nof many underdeveloped countries. Fourteen years \r\nlater, little has been achieved despite the effort of the \r\ncommunity of nations. Fragile or conflict-affected \r\ncountries are the furthest from achieving the MDGs. \r\nWorse still, the challenges of the year 2000 have taken \r\non a new path, with an increase in problems related to \r\nthe rise of tensions and conflicts in many parts of the \r\nworld.\r\nThe Organization’s true greatness and its global \r\nleadership ability are measured in difficult times such \r\nas these, where the search for peaceful solutions through \r\nmore intense dialogue may well determine the future \r\nof humankind. In order to respond to the challenges, \r\nwe need an Organization that operates effectively. \r\nWe need an Organization that is more active and \r\nless stereotyped — an Organization that strengthens \r\ncooperation with other organizations, particularly \r\nregional ones, and that acts with great respect for the \r\nsovereignty and the particularities of each State.\r\nEvery action carried out so far has just been a \r\ncontinuation of past measures that, in most cases, \r\nfailed to achieve results that can be considered positive. \r\nWe are witnessing an increasing loss of trust and we \r\nare faced with a crisis of values. More than trying to \r\ngrasp the nature of the issues that are causing us to \r\nreact, we must seek to understand the true causes of \r\nthe problems. When faced with a threat that does not \r\nrespect borders and that jeopardizes our commitment \r\ntowards tolerance and peace, it is vital that we better \r\nunderstand the interconnectedness of problems, so as \r\nto locate the civility gap that prevents us from talking \r\nto each other and from finding consensus.\r\nWe have always advocated the view that the use \r\nof military force does not establish universal values \r\nor build democracies. Misguided approaches that \r\nfail to recognize the various and diverse elements of \r\nthreats or, worse still, that are based on contradictions \r\nand conflicts of interest, only serve to fuel the fire of \r\nradicalism and extremist actions. Accordingly, we must \r\nreflect and think things over, because as they stand, we \r\nare merely sliding into the darkness of war, upholding \r\nthe ancient principle of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for \r\na tooth”.\r\nThat is why I reiterate to the General Assembly \r\nthat our collective efforts to preserve world peace \r\nand security must reject ill-conceived plans that are \r\nonly motivated by the strategic interests of the large \r\nPowers and their will to dominate. Instead, we need a \r\nplan that is more suited to the reality of each situation \r\nand that provides a true response to the main causes \r\nof the current crisis. This common agenda should not \r\nmanipulate facts to produce collective reactions, but \r\nrather admit past mistakes related to the urge to impose \r\n14-54929 19/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\npeace through war. Only by correcting our way of \r\nthinking and acting will we truly be giving peace a \r\nchance.\r\nThe responses to the crises faced by humankind \r\nshould not be weakened by the desire to end war by \r\nwaging war. Instead, they must be based on the desire \r\nto build a world of peace, supported by dialogue and by \r\nan effort — herculean, if need be — to respond to the \r\nroot causes of problems that lead to terrorism, racism, \r\nextremism and intolerance. When dozens of millions \r\nof people throughout the world suffer the horrors of \r\nconflict and the countless abuses perpetrated in this \r\ncentury of globalization, the actions by the international \r\ncommunity should give priority to the establishment \r\nof the best mechanisms for resolving the problems \r\nof exclusion, discrimination and marginalization of \r\ngroups, sects and ethnicities.\r\nWe must also ensure, from the very start, that the \r\nsocieties emerging from the ashes of those conflicts and \r\ncommitted to leaving the memories of the past behind \r\nare entitled to a vital transitional period with respect to \r\ntheir behaviours, their ways of thinking and acting, and \r\ntheir own internal rules and commitments. Otherwise, \r\nwe will just be sowing the seeds for new conflicts that \r\nwe may end up reaping later on. The war in Iraq, which \r\nhas destroyed the legacy of a centuries-old civilization, \r\nand the bloody conflicts in Afghanistan, Libya, Syria \r\nand Ukraine, should make the international community \r\ndraw its conclusions about the international standards \r\napplied in those contexts. The uncertainty and the \r\nbloody anguish that surround Israel and Palestine, \r\nwith those two peoples destined to live side by side, \r\nshould alert us once and for all to the fact that fear and \r\ninsecurity for the future lead to hate, which is the root \r\nof all evils.\r\nTimor-Leste knows only too well the consequences \r\nand the scars of war. In addition to the hundreds of \r\nthousands of Timorese killed, we also witnessed the \r\nnear-complete destruction of our country. A State \r\nborn without the ability to ensure and promote the \r\nfundamental rights and liberties of its citizens is a \r\nfragile State that is unable to carry out its main mission.\r\nImmediately after the war, we started to reconcile \r\nTimorese society. We wanted to achieve peace, since \r\nwithout peace we could not feel free. We have also \r\nembraced Indonesia in order to achieve true and \r\ngenuine reconciliation. Instead of feeding hatred \r\nand vengeance, we nurtured solidarity and tolerance \r\nbetween our communities. In that manner, we cultivated \r\na sound relationship of cooperation between our States \r\nand our peoples.\r\nWestern democracies are prone to paying for costly \r\ninternational tribunals for judging genocides. They also \r\ntend to feel shocked by the human rights violations that \r\noccur in developing countries. The issue with Indonesia \r\ncannot be seen only in terms of the actions by its \r\nmilitary and its generals. Instead, it must be seen within \r\na broader perspective, in which the Governments of the \r\nWestern Powers sold sophisticated weapons like rif les, \r\nwarships, fighters, ammunition, tanks and cannons to \r\nthe Indonesian military, in addition to providing it with \r\ntraining, so that it could decimate the Timorese. That is \r\nwhy we Timorese and Indonesians preferred instead to \r\nrecord the truth of the facts, to close this painful chapter \r\nin our past and to look to the future, which required and \r\ncontinues to require much effort to develop both nations \r\nand improve the living conditions of both peoples.\r\nWith its pluralistic and tolerant society, Indonesia is \r\nmore than a close neighbour. Indeed, it is an inspiration \r\nfor Timor-Leste. Under the wise leadership of President \r\nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyono, we have witnessed the \r\nestablishment of a modern democracy that harmonizes \r\nprogress with the promotion of national, regional \r\nand international peace. We sincerely hope that the \r\npeaceful transition to President Joko Widodo will \r\nbring more success to that great nation. And I say this \r\nin a year when Timor-Leste is celebrating the twelfth \r\nanniversary of its independence.\r\nMr. Mnisi (Swaziland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nWe have learned from our weaknesses and today \r\nwe are living in an atmosphere of social and political \r\npeace. We are very familiar with the challenges that \r\nare inherent in the efforts of developing a nation and \r\nof building peace and security. We are very thankful \r\nfor the support that the United Nations and all donor \r\ncountries have provided to Timor-Leste. Nevertheless, \r\nthe years of partnership have also taught us important \r\nlessons, which we have been sharing with the world, \r\nparticularly the fragile States. We are encouraging them \r\nto take ownership of their processes and be committed \r\nto the future of their citizens.\r\nWe have also started to be more internationally \r\nactive. We have been working hard within the scope of \r\nthe Group of Seven Plus, a group that brings together 20 \r\nfragile and conflict-affected countries. In addition to \r\nsharing experiences and knowledge and seeking to put \r\n20/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nthe needs of those countries on the global development \r\nagenda, we continue repeating, as many leaders have \r\nbeen doing since yesterday, that without peace there \r\ncan be no development. In turn, without development \r\nthere can be no room for democratic transition, since \r\ndemocracy is a dynamic process of assimilating \r\nprinciples and values, rather than a process to be \r\nmeasured by elections alone.\r\nAnd that brings us to the subject of the general debate \r\nat this sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly — the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. Inequality is increasing \r\ndangerously throughout the world, with wealth being \r\nconcentrated in the hands of a few to the detriment of \r\nus all. Even after the world learned of the greed and \r\nthe corruption of the international financial system that \r\nled to the global financial crisis, we are now seeing \r\nhow the faltering economic recovery is benefiting only \r\nthose who were responsible for the financial meltdown \r\nin the first place. Despite the best efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and his team at the United Nations, \r\nwe are almost in 2015 and know that 2.2 billion people \r\nthroughout the world are already in or are entering the \r\nranks of the extreme poor, without even knowing what \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals are.\r\nIn that regard, I must draw attention to the incorrect \r\npractice on the part of international organizations to \r\nview each of the 193 States Members of the United \r\nNations in the same manner, regardless of whether they \r\nare large or small, rich or poor, young or in a transitional \r\nperiod or centuries-old, developed, with emerging \r\neconomies, or underdeveloped. And these development \r\nindices create scales of values that are both unfair and \r\ndemotivating to the majority of the least developed \r\ncountries. Accordingly, all of us in attendance here \r\ntoday have a historic opportunity to share our thoughts \r\non the enormous challenges ahead of us, so as to outline \r\na truly transformative agenda in which no country is \r\nleft behind.\r\nHowever, the issue that deserves our collective \r\nattention and requires urgent measures is the mitigation \r\nof the environmental threats that continue to increase and \r\nare hindering the legitimate perspectives of emerging \r\nand developing countries. Fortunately, yesterday’s \r\nsummit on climate change raised expectations in \r\nrelation to actual action plans being implemented \r\nin some countries. The plans will be expanded to \r\nthe global level next year in Paris. Some developed \r\ncountries have also committed to providing capital \r\nto the Adaptation Fund, which is vitally important to \r\ndeveloping countries. Ms. Emilia Pires, the Minister \r\nof Finance of Timor-Leste, was a member of the high-\r\nlevel panel that advised the Secretary-General on that \r\nagenda.\r\nIn 2013 and until August, Timor-Leste had the \r\nhonour of assuming the presidency of the sixty-ninth \r\nsession of the Economic and Social Commission for \r\nAsia and the Pacific (ESCAP). As such, we had the \r\nprivilege of presiding over the session for one year \r\nand working with ESCAP and the nations of the Asia-\r\nPacific region in order to achieve progress and improve \r\nhuman development. Timor-Leste is committed to that \r\nnoble ideal and to that deserving mission of helping to \r\nnurture a culture of peace in our region through the \r\ngradual and persistent reduction of social inequalities \r\nwithin each country and among countries.\r\nHowever, in our region, including within the \r\nscope of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \r\ncountries are cooperating and promoting peace, \r\nwhich has enabled the rise of the Asian region, led by \r\nChina, and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of \r\npoverty. However, we cannot but be concerned by the \r\ndevelopments in the East and South China Sea.\r\nThat brings us to a key issue that is of vital \r\nimportance to Timor-Leste. I am speaking of the need \r\nto set maritime borders between countries in a clear and \r\nserious manner, in line with international law. Back in \r\n2002, when we began to walk our own path in freedom, \r\nwe saw a globalized world in which the arrogance of the \r\npowerful and the ambition of the rich, who prey upon \r\nthe inexperience and ignorance of the poor and the \r\nweak to act dishonestly and in bad faith, prevailed, as \r\na serious insult to universal values. And I must affirm \r\nthat big multinationals have always played an improper \r\nand disloyal role, acting dishonestly and in bad faith \r\nwhen dealing with poor countries.\r\nTimor-Leste, a young, small and poor country, \r\nwas caught off guard in that sophisticated culture of \r\nmanipulation and deceit. Nevertheless, we want to \r\ncontinue believing that international mechanisms, such \r\nas the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\ncontribute to justice between nations and understanding \r\nbetween peoples, so as to defend sovereign rights and \r\nthe truth.\r\nToday, those commitments are vital in order to \r\nstart rebuilding trust in the world system and to prevent \r\ntensions from increasing. The strengthening of dialogue \r\nand tolerance and the promotion of a new diplomacy \r\n14-54929 21/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nmust be translated from a set of good intentions into \r\nactual deeds in the international arena. But what is truly \r\nintriguing is the fact that no decent country has yet \r\nadvocated the need to carry out inquiries to determine \r\nthe origin of the weapons used to massacre civilians, \r\nparticularly those used to kill women and children, \r\nso as to identify the true beneficiaries of the world \r\ncrisis — those who are selling weapons to uncontrolled \r\ngangs throughout the world.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to inform the \r\nAssembly that this year, Timor-Leste has assumed \r\nthe rotating presidency of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP). In that forum, \r\nwe want to use diplomacy and cooperation to nurture \r\nour joint economic potential by making use of our \r\nregional ties. We also want to spread a message of \r\npeace, human rights and social justice throughout all \r\nthe forums in which we are represented.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is a member of that community and \r\na country with which Timor-Leste has been closely \r\ninvolved, including within the scope of the Group of \r\nSeven Plus, particularly once Timor-Leste realized that \r\nGuinea-Bissau had been left to its fate at the mercy of \r\ninternational sanctions. After a devastating cycle of \r\ncoups, we felt that the people of Guinea-Bissau needed \r\npeace and stability, and we saw how their leaders were \r\nstriving to achieve a collective commitment that would \r\nbenefit the people and the country.\r\nTimor-Leste had the honour of providing financial \r\nsupport and of sending a technical team to provide \r\nassistance throughout the entire electoral process in \r\nGuinea-Bissau. That process, which involved massive \r\ndemocratic participation, was a success and restored \r\nconstitutional order in the country. Still, as we all know, \r\nelections are but a starting point, and a State without \r\nthe means to ensure the basic needs of its people faces \r\ncountless challenges that can jeopardize the promise of \r\npeace and national cohesion.\r\nIn line with the subject of the debate in the General \r\nAssembly, I must say that it is now urgent to create \r\nthe conditions to enable Guinea-Bissau to move from \r\nfragility to resilience by supporting its State agencies. \r\nGuinea-Bissau needs to restore its public administration \r\nand its State agencies, as well as to reform its defence and \r\nsecurity sector by modernizing its forces. Furthermore, \r\nGuinea-Bissau requires a financial boost in order to \r\njump-start its economy.\r\nWithin the scope of the CPLP, we want to have \r\nactive collaboration with the authorities of Guinea-\r\nBissau and with its international partners, namely the \r\nEconomic Community of West African States, so as \r\nto hold an international conference on aid to Guinea-\r\nBissau as soon as possible. The conference should start \r\nby focusing on matters of extreme urgency, such as \r\nsalaries, food, security, fuel and health. Timor-Leste \r\nhas already contributed $6 million, which corresponds \r\nto one month of public-sector salaries in the country. \r\nI also urge every country in attendance to join Timor-\r\nLeste and the CPLP countries, in keeping with the \r\nhighest values of international solidarity, in supporting \r\nthe consolidation of the achievements made so far by \r\nthe people of Guinea-Bissau. Indeed, that is something \r\nthat will also convey a promise of peace to the entire \r\nAfrican continent.\r\nAnd I cannot talk about Africa — a continent \r\nthat is already wounded on the inside and ravaged by \r\nhunger and poverty — without mentioning the scourge \r\nof the Ebola virus, which is presently challenging the \r\ninternational health system itself. That epidemic, which \r\nis unprecedented in our time, requires a vital and urgent \r\ncommitment by the international community. This \r\nmorning in the Ebola campaign I found out that Timor-\r\nLeste will provide $1 million as immediate support \r\nwithin the spirit of solidarity that guides the Group of \r\nSeven Plus, which includes Sierra Leone, Liberia and \r\nGuinea-Conakry. Next year we will also be allocating \r\nan equal amount to help fight the epidemic.\r\nThe great challenge in today’s world is liberating \r\npeople from fear. I am talking about the fear of \r\ndifference, insecurity, hunger, poverty and disease, the \r\nfear of losing power or the fear of becoming a slave to \r\npower. In today’s unbalanced and unequal world, we \r\nneed to have the courage to speak a language of trust \r\nand tranquillity. We need to pacify minds, encourage \r\ndialogue and free people from doubt and feelings of \r\ninjustice so that they acquire greater tolerance and \r\ngreater respect for differences and diversity. We need \r\nto free people from the yoke of poverty and from the \r\ndeplorable conditions in which they are living so as to \r\nensure their right to development. We still have time \r\nto write a different and more humane tale for today’s \r\ngeneration and future generations.\r\nTimor-Leste wants to make an active contribution \r\nto a better world, where each country may live in \r\ntolerance, harmony and tranquillity within a true \r\natmosphere of friendship and solidarity that promotes \r\n22/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\npeace. Such peace must start in the minds and behaviours \r\nof the people at every level of society, so that they can \r\nhave a positive influence on the policies of the global \r\ncentres of decision-making. That is the only way for us \r\nto believe that the baby from the Marshall Islands who \r\ntouched all our hearts two days ago may be certain that \r\nher future is guaranteed and that she will be able to live \r\nin those small islands that make up her country.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Kay Rala Xanana Gusmão, Prime Minister \r\nof the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Norway\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Norway.\r\nMs. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Norway, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Erna Solberg, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Norway, and inviting her to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Solberg (Norway): The leaders who gathered \r\nat the United Nations Climate Summit have taken \r\nimportant steps to mobilize action and ambition on \r\nclimate change. Now we need to make sure that the \r\npositive results are followed through and expanded as \r\nwe prepare for an agreement in Paris next year.\r\nWhen we meet at the General Assembly next year, \r\nwe will adopt the new set of global goals for our common \r\nfuture — the sustainable development goals (SDGs). \r\nThey must build on the success of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). They must be realistic \r\nand ambitious. Like the MDGs, the SDGs should be \r\nfew in number, concrete and measurable. Meanwhile, \r\nachieving the eight Millennium Development Goals will \r\ncreate a solid foundation for sustainable development. \r\nAs co-chair of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s MDG \r\nAdvocacy Group, I will use every opportunity to help \r\nbuild that foundation over the remaining 462 days until \r\nthe deadline.\r\nWe must accelerate our efforts, and to do so we \r\nneed to enter into broad partnerships that include the \r\nprivate sector, civil society and Governments. We need \r\nto make use of the best possible innovative solutions \r\nand technologies. Governments and national political \r\nleaders must take the lead and ensure local ownership. \r\nAt the same time, we must support the remarkable work \r\nthat many people are doing to implement the MDGs in \r\npractice.\r\nThe frightening Ebola epidemic in West Africa \r\nreminds us of the fragility of our progress and \r\ndevelopment. We must build health-care systems that \r\ncan support courageous and determined individuals \r\nlike Josephine Finda Sellu. Ms. Sellu, the deputy nurse \r\nmatron at a Government hospital in Sierra Leone, lost \r\n15 of her nurses to Ebola. Nevertheless, she never \r\nstopped working in that death trap. She is a true fighter \r\nfor the MDGs.\r\nEducation, particularly for girls, is the superhighway \r\nto ending poverty. Poverty, discrimination and the use \r\nof force often prevent girls from getting the education \r\nthey are entitled to. Sexual violence, abductions and \r\ndeadly attacks are the most despicable ways in which \r\ngirls’ right to education is being violated. I condemn \r\nthe abductions of schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the \r\nstrongest possible terms. In the face of terrorists \r\nthreatening to deprive children of their right to \r\neducation, we should be inspired by Malala Yousafzai. \r\nMalala brought to light the plight of the millions of \r\nchildren around the world who are denied an education. \r\nIf one schoolgirl can take on the Taliban, then surely the \r\nworld community can defeat extremism and terrorism.\r\nTerrorists and extremists are trying to stop us \r\nfrom educating children. Peace is vital for achieving \r\nuniversal primary education. The same can be said \r\nfor the other MDGs, not least the goal on reducing \r\npoverty. That is why we must focus on conflict-affected \r\ncountries. A girl growing up in Syria today cannot look \r\nforward to going to school, because there is no school \r\nto go to. A pregnant teenage girl in South Sudan will \r\nnot get the maternal health services she needs because \r\nit is too risky for health workers to travel. From the \r\nSecurity Council Chamber to the modest homes in the \r\nSwat Valley in Pakistan, we can all help to end poverty \r\nby promoting peace, but all those different efforts at the \r\nglobal, regional, national and local levels must work in \r\nconcert.\r\n14-54929 23/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nIt has been 70 years since a group of leaders met \r\nin Washington, D. C., to discuss the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations. One of the most fundamental tenets \r\nof the new world order created in 1945 was respect \r\nfor internationally recognized borders. Norway \r\ncondemns Russia’s violations of international law and \r\nits continuing destabilization of eastern Ukraine. Any \r\nsettlement of the conflict must uphold international law \r\nand respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine. The \r\nceasefire agreed on 5 September must be respected and \r\nthe provisions of the agreement implemented on the \r\nground. Russia bears a particular responsibility in that \r\nregard.\r\nThe Security Council is mandated to maintain peace \r\nand security, but has failed to address the situation in \r\nSyria and Ukraine effectively. We know why. Some of \r\nthe big Powers still believe in outdated ideas of zero-\r\nsum games and spheres of influence. We are hopeful \r\nthat the Council will continue to stand united against \r\nthe threat of the terrorist group known as the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). We support the \r\nUnited States initiative and sponsored Security Council \r\nresolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist fighters. We \r\nencourage the countries of the region to take a leading \r\nrole in fighting ISIL.\r\nArmed conflict and civil war have created man-\r\nmade humanitarian disasters in Syria, Iraq, South \r\nSudan, the Central African Republic and Somalia. \r\nEarlier this year, Norway hosted a humanitarian donor \r\nconference for South Sudan, and we will shortly \r\nco-host a donor conference to address the aftermath of \r\nthe conflict in Gaza. Donor conferences are important, \r\nbut we need to look beyond the emergencies. We need \r\nto build on and improve the current system, when we \r\nmeet for the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016. We \r\nmust make sure that humanitarian aid supports not only \r\nshort-term recovery, but also long-term development. \r\nBesides, long-term development cooperation should \r\nhelp countries prevent, prepare for, withstand and \r\nrecover from humanitarian crises in the future.\r\nInternational peace, national security, social \r\ndevelopment and individual prosperity can best be \r\nfostered under a system of good democratic governance \r\nand human rights. Efforts to promote respect for \r\nhuman rights can help prevent armed conflict and mass \r\natrocities. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, \r\nherself a leading human rights defender, stated in her \r\nNobel lecture that:\r\n“[i]f the twenty-first century wishes to free itself \r\nfrom the cycle of violence, acts of terror and war, \r\nthere is no other way except by understanding \r\nand putting into practice every human right for \r\nall mankind, irrespective of race, gender, faith, \r\nnationality or social status.”\r\nI agree with that.\r\nHuman rights is one of the three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations, based on the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights, adopted by the Assembly on \r\n10 December 1948. Norway endorses the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s “Human Rights Up Front” initiative, which \r\nplaces the protection of human rights at the heart of \r\nUnited Nations strategies and operational activities. \r\nThe United Nations needs a strong and assertive human \r\nrights pillar. Only if we fund the human rights pillar \r\nproperly can we achieve the results that we need and \r\nwant from our world Organization.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is \r\nfirst and foremost the responsibility of States. We are, \r\nhowever, facing large implementation gaps. Attacks, \r\nthreats, intimidation and reprisals against human \r\nrights defenders are increasingly being reported. New \r\nlaws restricting freedom of expression and the work \r\nof civil society are being adopted. Discrimination \r\nis widespread, particularly against minorities, such \r\nas indigenous people and lesbian, gay, bisexual and \r\ntransgender persons.\r\nThe rule of law and civil liberties are also \r\nfundamental to the development of the private sector \r\nand attracting investment. Moreover, we know that \r\nenabling women to fully enjoy their social and economic \r\nrights unleashes tremendous economic growth.\r\nWe must stay focused on accelerating progress \r\ntowards the MDGs during the remaining 462 days. We \r\nmust let ourselves be inspired by those who serve at \r\nthe front line of those efforts, like Ms. Sellu and other \r\ndoctors and nurses who are risking their lives to treat \r\npatients with Ebola.\r\nAs we set our future development agenda beyond \r\n2015, we must also make some adjustments. Peace \r\nand stability must be included. Climate issues must be \r\naddressed. Good, democratic governance, with respect \r\nfor the rule of law and human rights, will be crucial for \r\nachieving sustainable development for us all. And all \r\nthat means, quite simply, is to be doing the right things \r\nright.\r\n24/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Norway for the statement she has just \r\nmade.\r\nMs. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Norway, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdelilah Benkirane, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Kingdom of Morocco\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Head of Government of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco.\r\nMr. Abdelilah Benkirane, Head of Government \r\nof the Kingdom of Morocco, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Abdelilah Benkirane, \r\nHead of Government of the Kingdom of Morocco, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Benkirane (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, Sovereign of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco, asked me to convey to the \r\nAssembly his greetings. He also asked me to deliver \r\nthe following statement, prepared for the sixty-ninth \r\nsession of the General Assembly:\r\n“It gives me great pleasure to take part in the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, for \r\nwhich President Kutesa has suggested ‘Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda’ as the central theme. That \r\nis a very relevant choice, which is fully in line \r\nwith our Organization’s priorities, especially as \r\nit encompasses economic, social, environmental, \r\nsecurity and political considerations. I have \r\ntherefore decided to devote my address to that \r\nimportant topic, knowing that the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco’s standpoint regarding other items on \r\nthe session’s agenda will be presented during the \r\nGeneral Assembly committee meetings or at the \r\nministerial meetings, which will be held on the \r\nsidelines of the General Assembly.\r\n“Achieving sustainable development is one of \r\nthe pressing challenges facing humankind. It is \r\nparticularly important, in that respect, to strike a \r\nbalance between the requirements for economic \r\nand social progress and the protection of the \r\nenvironment, on the one hand, and the safeguard \r\nof the rights of future generations, on the other. \r\nAware of those critical challenges, we have sought \r\nto set up a distinctive development model rooted \r\nin the culture and in the specific national values of \r\nthe Moroccan people — a model which also takes \r\ninto account the need for positive interaction with \r\ninternational principles and objectives in that area.\r\n“Morocco has therefore managed to develop \r\na pioneering national initiative for human \r\ndevelopment, together with ambitious programmes \r\nin the field of renewable energy — especially solar \r\nand wind power generation — which are a key \r\ncomponent of sustainable development. However, \r\nI am not here today to discuss my country’s \r\nexperience or our achievements. I am here to make \r\nan appeal for developing countries to be treated \r\nfairly, especially in Africa, and for the development \r\nissue to be addressed objectively.\r\n“As the Assembly knows, sustainable \r\ndevelopment is not something that can be achieved \r\nthrough decisions and ready-made prescriptions, \r\nnor is there a single model in that area. Indeed, \r\nevery country follows a path of its own, taking into \r\nconsideration its historical development, cultural \r\nheritage, human and natural resources, specific \r\npolitical circumstances, as well as its economic \r\nchoices and the obstacles and challenges facing \r\nit. What applies to the West should not be used as \r\nthe sole criterion for determining the efficiency of \r\nother development models; nor should one make \r\ncomparisons between countries, however similar \r\ntheir circumstances may be, even when those \r\ncountries belong to the same geographical area.\r\n“As a result, the first call I should like to \r\nmake from the rostrum regards the need to respect \r\nthe characteristic values and principles of every \r\ncountry as it builds its own development model. \r\nThat is particularly true for the developing countries \r\nthat are still suffering from the consequences of \r\ncolonialism. Colonialism caused severe damage to \r\ncolonized countries. For many years, it hindered \r\ntheir development process, exploited their resources, \r\nas well as the energies of their sons and daughters, \r\nbrought about profound change in the customs \r\nand cultures of the peoples concerned and sowed \r\nthe seeds not only of division between members \r\nof the same community, but also of conflict and \r\ndiscord between neighbouring countries. Although \r\nmany years have passed, the colonizers bear a \r\n14-54929 25/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nhistorical responsibility for the tough — and at \r\ntimes tragic — circumstances experienced by \r\nsome countries of the South, particularly in Africa. \r\nToday, given the adverse consequences suffered, \r\nformer colonial Powers have no right to ask the \r\ncountries of the South to introduce radical change \r\nrapidly, on the basis of a frame of reference with \r\nwhich they are unfamiliar, be it in terms of their \r\ncultures, their principles or their values. It is as if \r\nno development were possible other than through a \r\nsingle model: that of the West.\r\n“I now turn to the second appeal I would \r\nlike to make to the international community. We \r\nneed more realism and wisdom when dealing \r\nwith those countries. There should also be greater \r\nconsideration for their circumstances and the \r\npaths they choose to achieve democracy and \r\ndevelopment. Some Western countries — which \r\nasked for no one’s authorization to colonize \r\ncountries of the South — instead of currently \r\nproviding the necessary assistance to the people of \r\nthose countries, continue to impose on them harsh \r\nconditions, thereby hampering their ability to make \r\nprogress. Furthermore, all Western countries and \r\ntheir affiliated institutions do is give lessons, and, \r\nat best, a few pieces of advice. As for support, it \r\nis very limited and is always conditional. What is \r\nmore, they ask the countries of the South to achieve \r\nstability and development within a very short time \r\nframe and according to imposed conditions, without \r\ntaking into account those countries’ development \r\nprocesses or their specific national circumstances.\r\n“There can be no stability without \r\ndevelopment. By the same token, development \r\ncannot be achieved without stability. Both hinge \r\non respect for the sovereignty of States, their \r\nterritorial integrity, culture and customs, as well as \r\non a dignified life for all their citizens. Moreover, \r\nthe rating and classification of those countries, \r\naccording to current standards, raises a number of \r\nquestions. The rating process has not only shown \r\nits limitations, but also how far removed it is from \r\nthe reality of the countries of the South and how \r\nincapable it is of giving an objective account of \r\nthe level of human development achieved by those \r\ncountries. As inadequate as it unfortunately is, the \r\naid granted is often based on those ratings and their \r\nquasi-impossible conditions. We therefore appeal \r\nfor intangible capital to be one of the primary criteria \r\nfor measuring wealth and rating nations. As clearly \r\nshown by World Bank studies, intangible capital \r\ntakes into consideration a series of factors related \r\nto the living conditions of the population, such as \r\nsecurity, stability, human resources, institutional \r\ndevelopment and the quality of life and of the \r\nenvironment, all of which are elements that have \r\na major impact on crafting public policies. The \r\nevolution of those countries should not be governed \r\nby any rating or classification; instead, it should be \r\nviewed as a historical process based on the positive \r\nexperiences of each country. Similarly, every \r\ncountry’s characteristics should be respected.\r\n“The reference to the negative impact of \r\ncolonialism does not mean we wish to put any party \r\nin the dock of a law court. It is simply an earnest \r\nappeal for justice for the countries of the South and \r\na reconsideration of the way they are dealt with and \r\nsupported in their gradual march towards progress. \r\nIn my address in Abidjan, in February, I insisted on \r\nthe fact that Africa did not need humanitarian aid as \r\nmuch as it needed mutually beneficial partnerships. \r\nI also stressed that Africa needed to turn the page \r\non its past and overcome its political, economic \r\nand social problems — that it needed to rely on its \r\nown resources to achieve its development. That is \r\nexactly what Morocco has sought to accomplish \r\nthrough a series of important agreements signed \r\nwith a number of African sister nations. In that \r\nrespect, I wish to mention in particular the strategic \r\nagreement signed with Gabon for the production \r\nof fertilizers for African markets in order to \r\ncontribute to development and food security on the \r\nAfrican continent, which is home to a staggering \r\n60 per cent of the world’s unexploited land. That is \r\nan outstanding model of South-South cooperation \r\nthat reflects our capacity as African countries to \r\ndevelop the continent by relying on ourselves and \r\ninvesting in the natural resources of our countries.\r\n“As the Assembly knows, achieving \r\ndevelopment does not hinge merely on a set of \r\nprojects and on funding; nor is underdevelopment \r\nsynonymous with the countries of the South. Indeed, \r\nthe problem has nothing to do with Africans’ \r\nattributes and skills. Africans have proved their \r\nability to produce and create whenever the right \r\nconditions are met, and whenever they are able to rid \r\nthemselves of the oppressive legacy of colonialism. \r\nSimilarly, development in Africa has little to do \r\nwith the nature of the land or the weather, as harsh \r\nas they may be in some parts of the continent. It \r\n26/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nis more closely related to a deep-rooted economic \r\ndependence, a lack of support and funding and \r\nthe absence of a sustainable development model. \r\nAs a result, providing aid to those countries is not \r\nan option or an act of generosity so much as it is \r\na necessity and a duty. What States really need, \r\nthough, is fruitful cooperation, grounded in mutual \r\nrespect, so that they can create the right conditions, \r\nin theory and in practice, to move on to the next \r\nstage of the process of promoting both democracy \r\nand development, without any interference by \r\nothers in their internal affairs. In return, they must \r\ncommit to good governance.\r\n“The world stands at a crossroads today. Either \r\nthe international community supports developing \r\ncountries in their quest to achieve progress and \r\nensure security and stability, or we shall all face \r\nthe consequences of more conflicts and greater \r\nfanaticism, violence and terrorism — all of which \r\nfeed on feelings of injustice and exclusion — and no \r\npart of the world will be safe. As people grow more \r\nacutely aware of the cross-border threats posed by \r\nthe lack of sustainable and human development, \r\nand as we realize that ours is ultimately a common \r\ndestiny, I am sure that eventually there will be a \r\nglobal awakening regarding the need to work for a \r\nmore secure, equitable and humane world.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government of \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Abdelilah Benkirane, Head of Government of \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Natalia Gherman, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and European Integration \r\nof the Republic of Moldova.\r\nMs. Gherman (Republic of Moldova): It is with \r\ngreat honour and a special sense of responsibility that \r\nI address the General Assembly today. My country has \r\nchosen a European future, and that will make Moldova \r\nstronger and more prosperous. This year we have \r\nsigned, ratified and are already provisionally applying \r\nthe new Association Agreement with the European \r\nUnion (EU). The Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade \r\nArea, an integral part of the Agreement, opens new \r\nperspectives for Moldova’s access to European and \r\nworld markets. That will make our economy more \r\ncompetitive, stimulate economic growth and integrate \r\nMoldova into the mainstream of global trade, with all \r\nits benefits. The implementation of the Agreement is \r\nour short-term priority. Our next goal is to apply for \r\nfull-f ledged European Union membership.\r\nNow that we have defined our path and established \r\nthe framework for our further development, we must \r\nfocus on systemic improvements. Strengthening \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law, improving our investment \r\nclimate, developing rural areas and enhancing our \r\nenergy security — those are the objectives to be \r\naccomplished in the near term.\r\nWe are grateful to all our development partners \r\nfor supporting Moldova’s modernization agenda. \r\nThey have helped us to strengthen good governance, \r\npromote justice and domestic reforms, support the \r\nmodernization of the agricultural sector and implement \r\nenergy interconnection projects. Just recently, a new \r\npipeline was completed that connects Moldova via \r\nRomania to the European Union’s gas network. That \r\nand other strategic projects connecting Moldova to \r\nEurope, including power grids, roads and bridges, will \r\nbe implemented in coming years.\r\nOur ambitions, however, will not be fulfilled if \r\nthe benefits of closer association with Europe are not \r\nfully shared by our citizens living in the Transnistrian \r\nregion of the Republic of Moldova. Just like the rest \r\nof Moldova, people and businesses in that region want \r\nthe development opportunities that association with the \r\nEuropean Union clearly brings. The Free Trade Area \r\nwith the European Union will increase production \r\nand exports. Jobs, salaries, pensions and benefits will \r\ntherefore rise significantly.\r\nVisa-free travel by all Moldovan citizens to the \r\nEuropean Union as of April this year, along with new \r\ntrade and investment opportunities, are just a few real \r\nexamples that demonstrate that Moldova is on the \r\nright track. However, alongside the conflict-settlement \r\nprocess, we will continue focusing on building \r\nconfidence among citizens, the private sector and all \r\nother stakeholders of the entire country.\r\nAgainst that background, the resolution of the \r\nTransnistrian conflict and the reintegration of Moldova \r\nis another top priority for my Government. In our effort \r\nto resolve the conflict, our goal remains the same: to \r\nachieve a political settlement based on respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \r\n14-54929 27/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nof Moldova, with a special political status for its \r\nTransnistrian region. All of our international partners \r\ninvolved in the settlement process agree on those basic \r\nprinciples. And today more than ever before, we need \r\ntheir united and proactive support to help solve that \r\nprotracted conflict.\r\nDiscussions on the political and security aspects \r\nof the conflict should be resumed without delay \r\nwithin the 5+2 format for negotiations. There are other \r\noutstanding issues that create additional obstacles to the \r\nsettlement process. The continuing presence of Russia’s \r\nmilitary forces and ammunition in the Transnistrian \r\nregion, contrary to international commitments and the \r\nConstitution of the Republic of Moldova, is one of those \r\nissues. We expect the Russian Federation to finalize the \r\nwithdrawal process without any further delay. We also \r\nbelieve that bringing the peacekeeping arrangement in \r\nline with international standards by transforming the \r\ncurrent operation into a civilian multinational mission \r\nwould provide a positive impulse to the settlement \r\nprocess.\r\nMoldova seeks to develop fruitful relations with \r\nall its partners in the East and West. In the past five \r\nyears, my Government has promoted a coherent and \r\npredictable foreign-policy agenda, which is based \r\non our European integration choice. Regrettably, \r\nMoldova currently faces unjustified trade restrictions \r\non the export of its agricultural products to the Russian \r\nFederation. Trade relations in the whole Commonwealth \r\nof Independent States (CIS) region have been affected, \r\nbut we nevertheless hope that a continuing dialogue \r\nwith our Russian partners, based on the World Trade \r\nOrganization and CIS rules, will contribute to the \r\nresumption of normal trade relations with Russia. We \r\nare grateful for the assistance of our trading partners, \r\nparticularly the European Union, for supporting the \r\nGovernment in its efforts to lessen the immediate \r\nimpact of the restrictions on Moldovan farmers and \r\nproducers. Full liberalization of the European Union \r\nmarket for Moldovan wines and agriculture products, \r\nas well as a new free-trade-area agreement with Turkey, \r\nwill contribute to market diversification in the future. \r\nWe will continue to explore new trade partnerships in \r\nthe world.\r\nWe have followed with great concern the \r\ndevelopments in Ukraine. A year ago, no one could \r\nhave imagined that Ukraine would be plunged into such \r\na painful and profound crisis. At the very same time, \r\nUkraine, like Moldova, has also established a path for \r\nEuropean integration, and that offers a real chance \r\nfor improving people’s well-being while facilitating \r\nreconciliation, reconstruction and security. We believe \r\nthat the sovereign choices of all members of the \r\ninternational community should be respected.\r\nWe recall the need for all members of the \r\ninternational community to respect the provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nLike many other countries, we will never recognize \r\nthe annexation of Crimea. We also encourage any \r\ninvolvement by the international community, in \r\nparticular by the United Nations and the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, in actions to \r\nstabilize the situation on the ground. The sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of our neighbour Ukraine must \r\nbe respected.\r\nToday we face new and increasingly complex \r\nsecurity challenges. Moldova is doing its part to address \r\nthose challenges by making its own contribution to the \r\npromotion of peace, security and stability in Europe \r\nand in the international arena. We have taken concrete \r\nmeasures to support United Nations, EU and NATO \r\nefforts in that regard. This year, Moldova deployed 41 \r\nsoldiers to the NATO-led International Security Force \r\nin Kosovo operation, under the authority of the Security \r\nCouncil, and contributed to the EU Training Mission in \r\nMali. That represents a new level of commitment by \r\nMoldova to promoting international peace, security and \r\nstability.\r\nMoldova is committed to protecting human \r\nrights at the national and international levels. We \r\nhave made steady progress in the implementation of \r\nthe relevant United Nations special procedures and \r\nrecommendations. Moldova has volunteered to present \r\na mid-term evaluation report on the Universal Periodic \r\nReview recommendations in the area of human rights \r\nby October.\r\nAt the same time, a national strategic programme \r\nfor demographic security until 2025 is currently being \r\nimplemented in the Republic of Moldova. We want to \r\nbecome a regional centre of excellence for the best \r\npolicies in reproductive health and to contribute to the \r\nobjectives of the United Nations Population Fund.\r\nMoldova also shares its best practices on migration \r\nand development with other countries in the eastern and \r\nsouthern neighbourhoods of the European Union. We \r\nare actively engaged in the work of the Global Forum \r\non Migration and Development.\r\n28/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nMoldova also supports the advancement of a \r\nfree and independent society, including freedom of \r\nexpression on the Internet and in other media. For \r\nthe past three years, my country has had one of the \r\nbest and most affordable Internet connections in the \r\nworld. More than 65 per cent of Moldovans access the \r\nInternet at least once a day. That is why I am proud \r\nthat Moldova was accepted this year as a member of the \r\nFreedom Online Coalition. Moldova’s membership of \r\nthe Open Government Partnership is another important \r\ncontribution to the commitments made with regard to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are currently \r\nimplementing a comprehensive e-governance agenda. \r\nToday, Moldova is one of the first countries of the \r\nregion, and among the first 16 countries in the world, to \r\nhave an open data portal. Just recently, in August, the \r\nGovernment of Moldova approved the new Open Data \r\nPolicy in line with the Open Data Charter of the Group \r\nof Eight.\r\nWe have taken one step forward in agreeing on \r\na new post-2015 development agenda and a new set \r\nof sustainable development goals. My country will \r\ncontinue to contribute to that effort by hosting, in \r\nFebruary 2015, an event at which we will consolidate \r\nand endorse the conclusions of the high-level dialogue \r\non capacity-building and sustainable development.\r\nLet me reiterate Moldova’s commitment to \r\npromoting the core principles of the Organization and \r\nto assisting the international community in delivering \r\non the greatest promise of the United Nations — peace, \r\njustice, security and development for the people of the \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pierre Moukoko Mbonjo, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Moukoko Mbonjo (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): The President of the Republic of Cameroon, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Paul Biya, has requested me to convey \r\nto members, the Secretary-General and his fellow staff \r\nhis warm greetings and to deliver his statement before \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\n“Next year, we should adopt the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda in follow-up to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Throughout the sixty-\r\neighth session, our representatives actively worked \r\nto develop new goals to pick up the MDG torch. \r\nThat important task, since it concerns the raison \r\nd’être of the Organization, is not finished. It will \r\nbe incumbent upon the President to see it through. \r\nI am sure that he will succeed. Rest assured of the \r\nfull and wholehearted cooperation of my country \r\nin that regard.\r\n“For the post-2015 period, the United Nations \r\nseeks a transformative agenda that gives priority \r\nto the eradication of poverty and hunger, as well \r\nas to sustained and inclusive economic growth. \r\nCameroon fully shares that vision.\r\n“In Cameroon, since 2010, we have implemented \r\na strategy for growth and employment whose \r\nprimary purpose is indeed the reduction of poverty. \r\nThe measures taken in that regard aim in particular \r\nat creating jobs and improving the living conditions \r\nof the population. The recovery of our economy and \r\nour public finances, which has fostered the return \r\nof growth, bodes well for the success of our efforts. \r\nHowever, such progress, substantial and significant \r\nas it is, has not yet enabled us to eradicate poverty. \r\nIn the areas of education, health care, access to \r\nwater and electricity, roads, et cetera, there is still \r\na long way to go in order to meet the needs of our \r\npeople.\r\n“Most of the countries targeted by the \r\nMDGs — the developing countries — face similar \r\nsituations. That is why, like the President, we \r\nsupport a transformative post-2015 agenda. That \r\nwill clearly require some changes to our approach \r\nto development. It should no longer be seen as an \r\nexternal process but, rather, as an expression of \r\nthe wishes and needs of the target populations. \r\nMoreover, that is the common position of the \r\nAfrican countries.\r\n“Following a review of the MDGs, it will also \r\nbe necessary to establish a follow-up mechanism \r\nfor the goals of the new system. Finally, we will \r\ninevitably have to change the way in which \r\ndevelopment aid is financed in order to improve its \r\neffectiveness.\r\n“Once those conditions are met, we should \r\nwork on the most important matter of all, namely, \r\nensuring security. For it goes without saying that \r\nwithout security there can be no development. \r\nTake the example of my country, which is proud \r\nof having been a haven of peace and stability for \r\ndecades. To the east, since March 2013, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic has seen its security situation \r\nseverely deteriorate: massacres and population \r\n14-54929 29/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\ndisplacements have jeopardized any hope of \r\ndevelopment, not to mention the f lux of tens of \r\nthousands of refugees towards Cameroon. In the \r\nfar north, attacks by the Boko Haram group, which \r\nis more concerned about imposing shariah law than \r\nimproving the living conditions of populations, \r\nthreaten the integrity of our territory. There, too, the \r\nlack of security has caused thousands of displaced \r\npersons to f lee to my country. It is estimated that \r\nin recent months Cameroon has hosted more than \r\n200,000 refugees from all kinds of origins. It goes \r\nwithout saying that my country will continue to \r\nhonour its tradition of hospitality. However, if that \r\nsituation should continue, there is no guarantee that \r\nwe will have the resources to deal with it.\r\n“The time allocated to me does not allow \r\nme to mention the other areas of tension and \r\nconflict, whether in Africa, the Middle East or \r\nEastern Europe. The causes and issues are varied. \r\nI will therefore limit myself to urging the parties \r\nconcerned to negotiate and to seek peaceful \r\nsolutions.\r\n“That is the path that Nigeria and Cameroon \r\nchose to settle the dispute between them, some \r\nyears ago, over the Bakassi peninsula. It enabled \r\nus to find a solution conforming with international \r\nlaw and, above all, to seal an unfailing friendship \r\nbetween our two countries. Moreover it was, I \r\nshould stress, in harmony with the ideals of the \r\nCharter of our Organization.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mankeur Ndiaye, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand for Senegalese Living Abroad of the Republic of \r\nSenegal.\r\nMr. Ndiaye (Senegal) (spoke in French): I particularly \r\nwelcome the opportunity today to represent His \r\nExcellency Mr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic \r\nof Senegal, before the General Assembly and to deliver \r\nthis intervention on his behalf.\r\nIn line with my predecessors, I would like to extend \r\na warm welcome to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa and \r\nexpress my delegation’s particular pleasure in seeing \r\nhim assume the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session. In reiterating our warm wishes \r\nfor success in fulfilling his important duty, I assure him \r\nof the unwavering support of my delegation, which, as \r\nalways, will contribute in a constructive manner to the \r\nfull realization of the goals of the United Nations. I also \r\npay warm tribute to his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. John William Ashe, whose dynamism and open \r\nmind greatly contributed to the success of the sixty-\r\neighth session of the General Assembly. I also want \r\nto express, on behalf of the President of Senegal, our \r\nfull gratitude to Secretary-General Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his tireless efforts in promoting peace, security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nI am therefore particularly pleased by the \r\nopportunity to represent President Macky Sall and \r\nto take the opportunity offered to my delegation to \r\nwelcome the conclusions of the Open Working Group \r\non Sustainable Development Goals and those on the \r\nfinancing of sustainable development for the purpose of \r\ndefining the main pillars of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. The scope of those challenges, linked to this \r\nimportant moment for humankind, requires that our \r\nStates adopt appropriate strategies and measures with \r\na view to assuring a good transition and calmly facing \r\nthe expected global transformation.\r\nThe theme of this session — “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda” — provides an opportunity to deepen the \r\ndiscussion already begun during the previous session \r\nwith a view to establishing a common vision on the \r\nways and means to strengthen our commitment and \r\nour actions for sustainable and inclusive growth. It \r\nis therefore our mission to work towards inclusive \r\ndevelopment for present and future generations, given \r\nthe many challenges faced by our people, particularly \r\nin the areas of education, health, the fight against \r\npoverty and extreme poverty, energy, climate change \r\nand endemic poverty.\r\nWith that in mind, the Government of Senegal has \r\nresolutely moved towards a model whose goal is the \r\ncreation of wealth and structural transformation of its \r\neconomy. That is why we have adopted the Emerging \r\nSenegal Plan, which is, and for the next few years will \r\nbe, the reference point for Senegal’s economic and social \r\npolicies. Emerging Senegal is backed by a progressive \r\ndynamic that is firmly oriented towards sustainable and \r\ninclusive development.\r\nIn the light of all of the above, we need to understand \r\nthe importance of the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment, whose Steering Committee, led by the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, deserves to be \r\nfurther supported and promoted, given its goals relating \r\nto poverty eradication and infrastructure development \r\n30/31 14-54929\r\nA/69/PV.11 25/09/2014\r\nin Africa and the structural transformation of African \r\neconomies. \r\nAt this very moment, as we consider the issue \r\nof sustainable development, the world continues to \r\nbe confronted with terrorism and various crises and \r\nconflicts that are just as dangerous for international \r\npeace and security. The Sahel and West Africa are \r\nfaced with recurring threats from terrorist groups \r\nwhose criminal actions undermine the foundations of \r\nour society and hinder our development efforts. We are \r\npleased by the Security Council’s adoption yesterday \r\nof resolution 2178 (2014), a strong resolution against \r\nterrorism.\r\nWith regard to our subregion, our immediate \r\nneighbours in general and Guinea-Bissau in particular, \r\nSenegal would like to welcome the democratic process \r\nthat led to the election of President José Mário Vaz. I urge \r\nthe international community to support that fraternal \r\ncountry, with its enormous potential, including through \r\na donors round table. \r\nSimilarly, the efforts of the international community \r\nto help stabilize the Central Africa region are \r\nhampered by the arduous process of the disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration of the main militias \r\nand armed groups, while the Horn of Africa, on top \r\nof terrorism, is still severely affected by the scope of \r\nconflicts with disastrous humanitarian consequences. \r\nAnother part of Africa is suffering the effects of \r\na scourge — rather, I should say a catastrophe — and \r\nthat is the haemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola \r\nvirus. It certainly affects West Africa but is also a \r\ngenuine threat to the entire world. We are pleased \r\nby the Security Council’s adoption by consensus of \r\nresolution 2177 (2014), which was sponsored by 134 \r\ncountries, including Senegal, and by the high-level \r\nmeeting organized by the Secretary-General this very \r\nmorning, which was a resounding success. The decision \r\nto establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola \r\nEmergency Response has reassured our country that \r\nthe international community is aware of the scourge \r\nand that Ebola is not only an African matter but one \r\nthat affects the entire world. \r\nThat is why Senegal calls on the international \r\ncommunity to take swift action to provide the necessary \r\nsupport not only to the countries affected by the virus, \r\nbut to those of the entire West African region exposed \r\nto the ravages of this epidemic. The sooner we take \r\naction, the better we can control the epidemic. As for \r\nSenegal, we have set up a secure humanitarian corridor \r\nas a sign of solidarity with the brotherly countries that \r\nhave been struck by the disease.\r\nFurthermore, concerning another important issue, \r\nthat of Western Sahara, my country reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to strengthening the historic fraternal ties \r\namong all of the countries of the Maghreb and Africa \r\nin general. With that in mind, all forms of separatism \r\nmust be discouraged. In that regard, Senegal would \r\nlike to reiterate its support to Morocco’s initiative to \r\ngrant broad autonomy to Western Sahara in the context \r\nof respect for its sovereignty and for the relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council, for the sake of \r\ndurable peace in the region. \r\nFaced with all of those pressing challenges, my \r\ndelegation is convinced of the urgent need to establish \r\na holistic approach that can enhance the resilience of \r\ncountries facing recurrent crises and emerging new \r\nconflicts. From that perspective, a body such as the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) has, as part of its \r\nmandate, a significant role to play in re-establishing \r\npeace. Therefore, I would like to acknowledge here the \r\ndistinctive honour recently bestowed on Senegal, via \r\nthe person of Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice, who \r\nis the single African candidate standing in the election \r\nfor the position of President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the ICC, scheduled to take place in December.\r\nIn any event, Senegal remains committed to its \r\nirreversible path in favour of peace and international \r\nsecurity. It will continue to provide, with commitment \r\nand determination, its contribution to peacekeeping \r\noperations, while stressing the deployment of high-\r\nquality personnel, whenever it is requested and within \r\nits capacities. \r\nFor a global solution to crises, we believe that in \r\naddition to policies addressing the issues, conditions \r\nmust be conducive to restoring the economic capacities \r\nof countries affected by conflict. It is also urgent to \r\nstrengthen cooperation and refine our prevention \r\nstrategies to better cope with the escalating violence \r\nand new forms of conflict related to the spread of \r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nThe thorny issue of the Palestinian conflict comes \r\nto mind. In that connection, Senegal welcomes the \r\nceasefire of recent months. In its capacity as Chairman \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, Senegal reiterates its \r\ncall to revive the peace process and put an end to the \r\n14-54929 31/31\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.11\r\nblockade that has been suffocating Gaza since 2007. In \r\nthis International Year of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, Senegal renews its support for a just, peaceful \r\nand negotiated solution as the only option capable \r\nof ending the conflict and achieving the creation of \r\na viable, independent Palestinian State with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, living side by side with Israel \r\nwithin secure, internationally recognized borders.\r\nParadoxically, the acuteness of the current crises \r\nis symptomatic of the status quo that continues to bog \r\ndown the process of Security Council reform. I hope that \r\nthe upcoming celebration of the seventieth anniversary \r\nof our common Organization in 2015 will mark the start \r\nof a reformed and renovated Security Council. Senegal \r\ncommends the French initiative to suspend the right of \r\nthe veto in cases of mass crimes.\r\nAlso during the Assembly’s seventieth session, \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council will \r\nbe elected for the 2016-2017 term. As a candidate, \r\nSenegal wishes to request from this rostrum the support \r\nof all Member States for its election next year to a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Council, 25 years after its \r\nlast term on the Council.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.50 p.m.\r\n"
