I congratulate the President of the Assembly \r\non his unanimous election and wish to express our deep \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ncommitment and dedication.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for convening \r\nthe Climate Summit. The momentum generated at the \r\nSummit should pave the way next year for a binding \r\nagreement on climate change, with long-term and \r\ncomprehensive global commitments for climate \r\nsolutions based on the principles of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, equity and respective \r\ncapabilities. It is an irony that the world’s most \r\nvulnerable countries happen to be the worst victims \r\nof climate change through no fault of their own. There \r\nshould be special provisions for climate financing, \r\nseparate from regular official development assistance, \r\nso that the mitigation and adaptation needs of the least \r\ndeveloped countries and small island developing States \r\ncan be addressed.\r\nTerrorism is anathema to humankind. It is a \r\nserious threat to peace, security and development. \r\nNepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations. We share the concern \r\nabout the growing scourges of terrorism, extremism \r\nand religious fundamentalism. In that context, we \r\nwelcome the convening of the Security Council summit \r\nmeeting earlier this week (see S/PV.7272) and support \r\nthe adoption of resolution 2178 (2014), on foreign \r\nterrorist fighters. We appeal for an early conclusion of \r\na comprehensive convention on international terrorism \r\nand the effective implementation of the provisions of \r\nthe United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. \r\nNepal believes that terrorism can best be tackled under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations with a coordinated \r\nglobal response.\r\nPeacekeeping has emerged as the central activity \r\nof the United Nations and an innovative tool for \r\ndealing with challenges to peace and security. Nepal \r\nis proud to have contributed to the maintenance of \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.14\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n14th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 26 September 2014, 6.30 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\ninternational peace and security through United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in troubled parts \r\nof the world. Nepalese Blue Helmets have been \r\ncommended for their professionalism and commitment \r\nin trying circumstances. We are currently the fifth-\r\nlargest troop contributor to that f lagship activity. With \r\never-greater commitment and dedication, Nepal will \r\ncontinue to participate in peacekeeping operations \r\nand to promote gender equality through the increased \r\nparticipation of women in peacekeeping. We urge this \r\nworld body to give due consideration to the safety and \r\nsecurity of peacekeepers. Nepal calls for equitable \r\nleadership opportunities, commensurate with Member \r\nStates’ troop contributions, to be made available both at \r\nHeadquarters and in the field.\r\nNepal stands for general and complete disarmament, \r\ncovering all weapons of mass destruction, in a \r\ntime-bound, verifiable and effective manner. We \r\ncall upon Member States, especially nuclear-weapon \r\nStates, to halt militarization in all spheres and step up \r\nmeasures for disarmament in order to free up much-\r\nneeded dividends for development. We wish to see an \r\nenlarged role for the United Nations Regional Centre \r\nfor Peace and Disarmament in Asia, which is based in \r\nKathmandu.\r\nAs a least developed and landlocked country, Nepal \r\nfaces structural constraints and pervasive and complex \r\ndevelopment challenges. My delegation underlines the \r\nurgency of addressing the special needs of the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) and supporting them \r\nwith the provision of enhanced resources for inclusive \r\ndevelopment.\r\nNepal calls upon the international community, \r\nparticularly donors, to fulfil all the commitments made \r\nin favour of LDCs. We underline the timely, full and \r\neffective implementation of the Istanbul Programme of \r\nAction for LDCs. Nepal aims to graduate from LDC \r\nstatus by 2022. An enhanced level of international \r\nsupport to build our productive capacity, improve supply-\r\nside capacity, minimize shocks and vulnerabilities and, \r\nabove all, bring about structural transformation will be \r\ncritical to meeting that target.\r\nNepal remains fully committed to the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights and has put the \r\nrequired institutional mechanisms in place. We remain \r\nconstructively engaged with all United Nations human \r\nrights mechanisms and the international community \r\nin the protection and promotion of human rights. We \r\nreject politicization and selectivity in the application of \r\nhuman rights standards.\r\nMy Government is determined to bring about a \r\ndignified closure of the past dating back to the armed \r\nconflict. We believe the Truth and Reconciliation \r\nCommission and the Commission on Disappearances \r\nwill help put our past behind us and prevent a \r\nrecurrence of grave violations of human rights. I want \r\nto reassure the international community that there will \r\nbe no blanket amnesty for grave crimes. We underline \r\nthe need to ensure the rights and well-being of migrant \r\nworkers.\r\nNepal has always supported the call for a just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East \r\nand an end to the spiralling conflict in the region. \r\nWe recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople on the basis of United Nations resolutions and \r\nencourage Israel and Palestine to live as neighbours \r\nwithin secure and recognized international boundaries.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria \r\ndemands a more proactive United Nations engagement. \r\nWhile supporting the independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of those countries, we urge the \r\nUnited Nations to play an active role in finding a political \r\nsettlement and helping those countries move towards \r\nnational unity, reconciliation and reconstruction.\r\nWe hold the view that the people of Ukraine should \r\nenjoy the right to freely decide their destiny without \r\nany outside interference.\r\nOur unwavering faith and long struggle for a \r\ndemocratic system of governance has given us the \r\nstrength to mainstream the armed Maoist rebels into \r\na peaceful democratic process and lead a successful \r\ntransition from autocratic monarchy to democratic \r\nrepublican order, thereby setting up unique models. The \r\npolitical parties in Nepal, including the Maoists, are \r\nnow working together to have a democratic Constitution \r\npromulgated through the elected Constituent Assembly. \r\nMy Government remains committed to bringing the \r\nparties both within and outside the Assembly on board \r\nwithin the framework of constitutionalism, political \r\npluralism and the rule of law, to put the country on the \r\npath of peace, stability, development and a democratic \r\nsystem of governance.\r\nWe greatly appreciate our neighbours, India \r\nand China, the United Nations, our friends and well-\r\nwishers in the international community for their \r\n14-55113 3/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nsupport for and solidarity with our peace process and \r\ndevelopment efforts. We firmly believe that democracy \r\nis indispensable for peace, progress, stability and \r\nprosperity. Peace, democracy and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are inextricably linked and mutually \r\nreinforcing. Development is not possible in the absence \r\nof peace, which, in turn, cannot be attained in the \r\nabsence of democracy.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda becomes truly \r\ntransformative only when the pressing needs and \r\npriorities of the most vulnerable and marginalized \r\ncountries and societies are faithfully integrated into the \r\nbroader global agenda and are provided with sufficient \r\nresources to achieve them. A holistic development \r\nprocess does not leave an unfinished agenda behind, \r\nso the remaining tasks of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals should be fully incorporated in the post-2015 \r\nagenda.\r\nWe consider corruption to be the biggest enemy \r\nof the people and a threat to peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment. My Government has underlined the \r\nimportance of transparency, accountability and zero \r\ntolerance for corruption as prerequisites to improving \r\nthe quality of governance and delivering results to the \r\npeople.\r\nNepal’s foreign policy is inspired by the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations. People’s aspirations \r\nfor peace, stability, progress, decency, dignity and \r\nprosperity are firmly embedded in it. We strongly \r\nbelieve that peaceful coexistence, mutual respect \r\nfor each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States, \r\nand equality and mutual benefit should constitute the \r\nfundamental tenets of inter-State relationships.\r\nReforms of the United Nations, including the \r\nSecurity Council, need to reflect contemporary realities \r\nfor making it more effective, representative, responsive \r\nand capable of handling increasingly complex global \r\nproblems. We support the expansion of membership \r\nin both permanent and non-permanent categories. The \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations, next \r\nyear, should be an occasion to ensure the representation \r\nand increase the voices of developing countries in the \r\nSecurity Council. In that context, Nepal reiterates its \r\nsupport for the desire of India, Japan, Germany and \r\nBrazil to serve as permanent members in the expanded \r\nSecurity Council. We also believe that the African \r\ncontinent and Member States that have contributed to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nshould also be given due consideration in any expansion.\r\nIn seven decades of the United Nations, it has been \r\nfound to be most successful when we honour the letter \r\nand spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe decisions we make. B.P. Koirala, the first elected \r\nPrime Minister of Nepal, while addressing the General \r\nAssembly at its fifteenth session, in 1960, said,\r\n“The real solution of the world’s problems, \r\nincluding the problem of world peace and prosperity, \r\nlies in the direction of strengthening and extending \r\nthe authority of the United Nations. This authority \r\nwill be strengthened and fortified if the decisions \r\nof the United Nations are respected faithfully and \r\nloyally by all Powers, great and small.” (A/PV.878, \r\npara. 235)\r\nIn conclusion, my Government reiterates its \r\nprofound commitment to the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations as the embodiment of \r\npeace, progress and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Sushil Koirala, Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Nepal, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Irakli Garibashvili, Prime \r\nMinister of Georgia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Georgia.\r\nMr. Irakli Garibashvili, Prime Minister of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Irakli Garibashvili, \r\nPrime Minister of Georgia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Garibashvili (Georgia): It is a great honour for \r\nme to represent my country here at the United Nations. \r\nIn recent years, the world has witnessed Georgia’s \r\nunwavering transformation to freedom, democracy \r\nand economic development. We have experienced \r\ntremendous advances, and occasional challenges, on \r\nour journey to a fuller and more open democracy. We \r\nare a vastly stronger nation than we were 20 years ago, \r\n4/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nand we are a much stronger nation than we were just two \r\nyears ago. While we have made significant progress in \r\na few short years, we are still a young democracy, and \r\nmuch remains to be done.\r\nI am fortunate to be part of a new generation \r\nof Georgians who grew up in the years following \r\nthe Cold War. My entire life is one of being part of \r\nremarkable change. Our tremendous progress is due to \r\nthe commitment of the Georgian people to democratic \r\nvalues and their embrace of international cooperation. \r\nBecause our democratic transformation has been so \r\nhard, we do not take anything for granted. To paraphrase \r\nPresident Kennedy: we do not do these things because \r\nthey are easy, we do them because they are hard. During \r\ndifficult times, the Georgian people took to the streets \r\nin peaceful protest and made their voices heard at the \r\nballot box to ensure that our democratic path continued. \r\nI want to express my sincere admiration for the people \r\nof Georgia and for their energy and commitment to \r\nsecuring our democratic progress.\r\nI would also like to express my gratitude to \r\nthe international community, our partner countries \r\nrepresented in this Hall and international organizations, \r\nespecially the United Nations, for supporting Georgia \r\nand listening to the Georgian people. Despite all the \r\nchallenges that we have faced, the citizens of Georgia \r\nare full of hope. The support from the international \r\ncommunity and international organizations continues \r\nto play a crucial role in Georgia’s progress. On behalf \r\nof the people of Georgia, we thank them. Georgia’s \r\nsuccess is their success. Georgia’s journey is a testament \r\nto the good work done by the United Nations and our \r\ninternational partners.\r\nIn the past two years, we have taken concrete steps \r\nto break the vicious cycle of Government corruption, \r\nimpunity and an economy that benefited only a few. \r\nWe have created a true democracy with a system of \r\ngovernance that is more open, more transparent and \r\nmore accountable and that upholds the rule of law. We \r\nhave established a social compact that rewards work \r\nand enterprise, while offering support for those in need.\r\nAs recognized by various international \r\norganizations, the Georgia of today is another world \r\ncompared to that of two decades ago, or even just two \r\nyears ago. Every sector of our country has advanced \r\ndramatically, from health care and education to the \r\neconomy and the rule of law. We are now at the dawn \r\nof a new day for Georgia. Our democratic institutions \r\nare stronger. Our foreign policy is making us more \r\nsecure. Our growing economy is working to benefit all \r\nGeorgians.\r\nWe are strengthening and consolidating Georgia’s \r\ndemocracy. The parliamentary, presidential and \r\nmunicipal elections held in Georgia during this two-\r\nyear period are truly something to celebrate. Because \r\nGeorgia’s democracy was hard-won, there is no going \r\nback. The Georgian people will hold the Government \r\naccountable at the ballot box. My Government must \r\nearn every vote by serving the people faithfully and by \r\nachieving progress for the country.\r\nWe are strengthening democratic institutions and \r\nestablishing stronger checks and balances. Our new \r\nConstitution decentralizes executive power and creates \r\ngreater accountability at all levels of Government. Our \r\nParliament now functions as a true legislature. Laws \r\nare proposed, debated and amended. Committees hold \r\nhearings and question ministers. The old rubber stamp \r\nhas been thrown away. We now guarantee the protection \r\nof human rights through a new human rights strategy \r\nand action plan. In addition, we are equally proud to \r\nhave enacted a new anti-discrimination law that extends \r\nthe protection of human rights to all Georgian citizens.\r\nWe have restored the rule of law by establishing an \r\nindependent judiciary and by instituting more rights for \r\ndefendants. We have ended impunity by Government \r\nofficials and torture and abuse in our prisons. All \r\nGeorgians are now equal before the law. No one is above \r\nthe law. Everyone will have the benefit of a judicial \r\nprocess that meets the highest international standards.\r\nWe are committed to building truly strong, \r\nindependent and high-quality media. The media, like \r\ncivil society, are essential to a strong democracy. While \r\nI may not always agree with what the media say or \r\nwrite, I will always fight to make sure that they have \r\nthe right to the freedom of speech.\r\nSuch reforms will benefit all citizens of my country. \r\nOur goal is to unify our society through the rule of law \r\nand democracy. Our commitment to aligning more \r\nclosely with the United States and Europe goes hand \r\nin hand with our commitment to continued democratic \r\ntransformation. The United States is a key strategic ally \r\nof Georgia. The relationship between our countries at \r\nall levels of Government has never been stronger.\r\nIncreased Euro-Atlantic and European integration \r\nis our way of returning to the family of European \r\n14-55113 5/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nnations, with whom we share a history, a culture and, \r\nmost important, common values. Our new Association \r\nAgreement with the European Union and our steadfast \r\nmovement towards NATO membership form the \r\nfoundation for that relationship and provide an umbrella \r\nfor greater engagement. As German Chancellor Angela \r\nMerkel said at this very rostrum, there is no development \r\nwithout security and no security without development \r\n(see A/65/PV.5). Our Association Agreement is the \r\nmaster plan for the gradual establishment of European \r\npolitical, economic, social and legislative norms and \r\nstandards. My country has embarked on a demanding \r\npath of wide-ranging reforms. We will deliver on our \r\ncommitments.\r\nI believe that Georgia’s democratic transformation \r\ncan serve as a model for other countries in the region. \r\nToday, we pledge to share our experience with nations \r\ngoing through similar transitions. As we deepen our \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic integration, we are also \r\nbecoming a truly open and globalized economy. We \r\nare making important investments and reforms to \r\nunlock the full potential of the Georgian economy \r\nand the Georgian people. From universal health care \r\nto investments in clean energy, Georgia is becoming \r\na twenty-first-s we pursue those reforms, we seek to \r\nimplement the United Nations development agenda \r\nbeyond 2015. We have become a leader in sustainable \r\ndevelopment, taking the outcomes of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development seriously. \r\nWe are ready to work together with the international \r\ncommunity to define a post-2015 development agenda \r\nthat is inclusive and people-centred. That agenda \r\nwill address the need to achieve economic stability, \r\nsustained economic growth, the promotion of social \r\nequity and the protection of the environment. At the \r\nsame time, we are committed to enhancing gender \r\nequality, women’s empowerment and equal employment \r\nfor every Georgian.\r\nThe future belongs to the next generation, so the \r\nprotection and development of our children to achieve \r\ntheir full potential must be based on greater investment \r\nin their education.\r\nA top area of concern for Georgia is the issue of \r\ninternally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees. There \r\nare hundreds of thousands of IDPs in Georgia as a result \r\nof Russia’s military aggression. Yet Georgia is still \r\ntaking in refugees from other conflict-torn regions. \r\nSadly, the sources of new refugees are increasing, not \r\ndecreasing, especially in the light of current conflicts \r\nin Ukraine and the Middle East.\r\nWe are also doing everything we can to help \r\nour friends in Ukraine by providing humanitarian \r\nassistance, political support, technical help — such as \r\nsending doctors and medicine — and serving as a safe \r\nrefuge for children affected by the conflict. We are also \r\nhelping them implement reforms and strengthen their \r\ndemocratic institutions. The ongoing developments \r\nin Ukraine tear at our hearts. We strongly support \r\nUkraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty. We \r\nhope that the recent peace treaties will put an end to \r\nthe military operations once and for all and mark the \r\nbeginning of an irreversible peacemaking process.\r\nThe international community has spoken with \r\nincreasing support every year for the right of return \r\nby adopting the General Assembly resolution on the \r\n“Status of internally displaced persons and refugees \r\nfrom Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali region/\r\nSouth Ossetia, Georgia”. It is essential that the General \r\nAssembly continue to retain this humanitarian issue \r\non the agenda and support the rights of the forcibly \r\ndisplaced with strength and conviction.\r\nI should now like to address my brothers and \r\nsisters in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. I say to my \r\ndear brothers and sisters, I dream of the day when we \r\nshall all live together in peace and prosperity. We are \r\ncommitted to the path of reconciliation and restoring \r\nGeorgia’s full territorial integrity and sovereignty. We \r\nmust work to find a way for them to participate in our \r\nsuccess, including the benefits of our new European \r\nUnion Association Agreement.\r\nI also call on the Russian Government to fulfil \r\nits obligations under the 2008 international ceasefire \r\nand join in the search for peace, prosperity and \r\nreconciliation. Our history and our values are a source \r\nof strength. When combined with our strategic location, \r\nthis allows us to offer something unique to the world \r\nand serve as a driver of peace and security.\r\nBeyond our borders, we aim to contribute to global \r\nsecurity as a supplier of security, not just a consumer. \r\nMy country’s dedication to becoming a security \r\ncontributor to the world is evident in our aspirations \r\nfor European and Euro-Atlantic integration, which are \r\nthe main pillars of Georgia’s foreign policy. Building \r\non the achievements of the past two years, my country \r\nhas made significant progress that reinforces our path \r\nto eventual NATO membership. The historic NATO \r\n6/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nSummit reaffirmed that Georgia will be a member of \r\nNATO in the future, and our people remain committed \r\nto this ultimate objective. As a result of the decisions \r\ntaken at the Wales Summit, NATO will significantly \r\nincrease Georgia’s integration and provide tangible \r\ncooperation initiatives that will increase Georgia’s \r\ncapabilities and overall security.\r\nWe are the largest non-NATO contributor to the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan \r\n(ISAF), and we are committed to taking part in the post-\r\nISAF mission. From the operation’s outset, our troops, \r\nincluding medical personnel, staff officers and training \r\ninstructors, will be ready for deployment. We also plan \r\nto contribute to institution-building in Afghanistan.\r\nWe stand with our allies in combating all forms of \r\nterrorism and organized crime, anywhere in the world.\r\nWe are also proud to contribute to the European \r\nUnion’s efforts under the Common Security and \r\nDefence Policy to build peace and security worldwide. \r\nIn that context, as the second-largest participant, a \r\nGeorgian battalion and a light infantry company have \r\nalready started a mission under the EU-led operation in \r\nthe Central African Republic.\r\nOur willingness to serve shoulder to shoulder with \r\nour allies is not the only way Georgia is serving as a \r\nglobal security provider. We are also taking a rational \r\napproach to reducing regional tensions and preventing \r\nconflict.\r\nLet me be clear, Georgia will never sacrifice its \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty. However, we will \r\ncontinue to look for pathways to reconciliation with our \r\nbrothers and sisters in Abkhazia and South Ossetia.\r\nWe Georgians want a good relationship with \r\nRussia, but never at the expense of our sovereignty and \r\nindependence, which we fought so hard to achieve. To \r\nthat end, we are pursuing a new approach, different \r\nfrom that of our predecessors, in dealing with Russia. \r\nWe are pursuing a two-track engagement strategy \r\nbased on our being a responsible, pragmatic and \r\nconstructive neighbour. On the first track, we started an \r\nunconditional dialogue with Russia on the resumption \r\nof trade, economic, cultural and humanitarian relations. \r\nOn the second track, we have continued to seek a \r\npeaceful settlement of the August 2008 war and the end \r\nof Russian occupation of Georgian territory, based on \r\nthe fundamental principles of international law.\r\nThe first track has produced significant results \r\nand has helped reduce tensions between Georgia and \r\nRussia. Trade has reopened and Georgian exports to \r\nRussia have increased over 300 per cent. People-to-\r\npeople exchanges have also increased dramatically. \r\nWe are coexisting more calmly as neighbours. This \r\napproach has also increased stability in the entire South \r\nCaucasus region.\r\nHowever, Georgia’s efforts to reduce tensions and \r\nextend an olive branch to Russia have not been met \r\nwith the same spirit of cooperation. We have taken \r\nevery constructive step. Now it is time for the Russian \r\nGovernment to stop the occupation and start on a path \r\nto lasting peace.\r\nMy country is committed to using its strategic \r\nlocation to connect Asia, Europe and the Middle East, \r\nthereby expanding trade from one end of Eurasia to \r\nthe other. The reopening of the Silk Road is one of \r\nthe greatest achievements brought about by the end of \r\nthe Cold War. The Silk Road region accounts for two \r\nthirds of the world’s population and 60 per cent of its \r\ngross domestic product. If its potential is fully tapped, \r\nit will become a key force for the expansion of trade, \r\nthe development of new energy resources and supply \r\nchains and the promotion of cultural exchanges. To \r\nfully unlock that potential, the international community \r\nmust redouble its efforts in three key areas: trade and \r\ntransport, energy, and people-to-people contacts.\r\nWe have deepened cooperation with Turkey, China, \r\nKazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Turkmenistan, \r\nUzbekistan and Afghanistan to integrate transportation \r\ncorridors and open new routes that will bring goods \r\nfrom Asia to Western Europe in record time. Energy \r\nresources are a key driver of Silk Road economic \r\ndevelopment and integration.\r\nWe support a key route for Caspian Sea oil and gas to \r\ntravel to Europe. Last year, the Shah Deniz Consortium \r\nannounced a massive expansion of the South Caucasus \r\nPipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia, which \r\nwill bring 16 billion cubic metres of new natural gas \r\nto Europe and Turkey and thousands of new jobs to \r\nGeorgia. Several days ago, I was in Azerbaijan to break \r\nground and lay the first segment of that new pipeline. \r\nThe expansion will lead to approximately $2 billion in \r\nnew investment by the Consortium in Georgia alone. Of \r\ncourse, that will result in Georgia receiving significant \r\nquantities of natural gas to improve our economic \r\ndevelopment and security.\r\n14-55113 7/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nClean, renewable energy can also be a driver \r\nfor regional energy cooperation. In Georgia, we are \r\nutilizing our massive hydropower resources to become \r\na carbon-neutral country and to export renewable \r\nenergy to our neighbours. The potential of the region \r\nis great, but more is needed to turn such potential into \r\nreality. Georgia is ready to use its location as a strategic \r\ncrossroads and to do its part to fully revitalize the Silk \r\nRoad. To that end, I intend to establish a Silk Road \r\nforum in 2015, and in Georgia we plan to launch an \r\nannual high-level meeting of all States and international \r\norganizations that are interested in the future of the Silk \r\nRoad. The forum will discover new ideas for enhancing \r\ncooperation in the fields of transport, energy, trade and \r\npeople-to-people contacts across the Silk Road. The \r\nforum will move beyond discussion to action.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reaffirm that I am so very \r\nconfident that our best years are ahead of us, and \r\nthat our worst are now part of history. I am confident \r\nthat Georgians have come together to move our \r\nnation forward and to fulfil the promise of a strong, \r\nindependent and free, great Georgian nation. Working \r\ntogether, there is no limit on what Georgia, the region \r\nand the world can achieve. I look forward to seeing \r\nmany present here today in Tbilisi.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Irakli Garibashvili, Prime Minister of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Elio di Rupo, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Belgium\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Elio di Rupo, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\nMr. Elio di Rupo, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nBelgium, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Elio di Rupo, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Belgium, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Di Rupo (Belgium) (spoke in French): \r\nMyriam Riva, Emmanuel Riva, Dominique Sabrier, \r\nAlexandre Strens — these are the names of the four \r\npeople brutally murdered on 24 May in Brussels. Four \r\npeople were killed just because they were in a Jewish \r\nmuseum, an institution dedicated to culture, knowledge \r\nand intelligence. I named these four victims, but I do \r\nnot forget the thousands of anonymous victims of \r\nbarbarism around the world. For the abject act that took \r\nplace at the Jewish Museum in Brussels is connected to \r\nthe events sweeping the world right now. In Syria and \r\nIraq, as well as in countries like Algeria, terrorists kill \r\ninnocent people every day.\r\nSyria and Iraq are of special concern to us. There, \r\ndefenceless people, women and children are victims of \r\nmassacres, persecution, destruction and the theft of all \r\ntheir possessions — all because they belong to cultures, \r\nincluding the Muslim culture, that the terrorists do not \r\nagree with. Yet, no religion, and certainly not Islam, \r\nasserts that we must kill those who think differently. \r\nWe have to say this over and over again in order to \r\nremove any excuse for these criminals who sow terror.\r\nThe personal history of the alleged perpetrator \r\nof the attack against the Jewish Museum in Brussels \r\nresonates with all of us. It is that of a French jihadist \r\nwho visited Syria in the ranks of the so-called Islamic \r\nState. This jihadist then moved across Europe before \r\ncommitting the irreparable. It is common trajectory for \r\nmany of these foreign fighters. These foreign fighters \r\nare a threat to every country in the world. Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), adopted the day before \r\nyesterday, is an important step towards a coordinated \r\nglobal response. We must and we shall put these \r\nterrorists in a position where they can no longer inflict \r\nharm.\r\nBeyond the humanitarian support it has already \r\nbrought to the Iraqi people, Belgium recently decided \r\nto send six F-16 fighters in support of the fight against \r\nterrorism in Iraq. My country also wants to strengthen \r\ncooperation among States. Belgium wants to intensify \r\nthe exchange of information at the European level and \r\nwithin NATO. As required by the Security Council \r\nresolution, a major preventive effort must also be made \r\nto prevent jihadist aspirants from reaching the combat \r\nzones. We must prevent the recruitment, training and \r\ntransportation of our citizens who may be tempted to \r\njoin terrorist groups. For minors in particular, each \r\ncountry must demonstrate a total vigilance regarding \r\nborder control.\r\nThe battle we are waging against terrorism reflects \r\na conflict between two understandings of life: respect \r\nfor human beings, which we have and the terrorists do \r\nnot; defence of freedom everywhere and always, which \r\nthe terrorists do not want; tolerance, while the terrorists \r\n8/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\npreach and impose intolerance. For us, life is priceless; \r\nfor them, it has no value.\r\nWe know that military actions alone are not enough. \r\nHere, as there, what is needed is to focus on education, \r\neducational support, openness to others and the world. \r\nOur goal should be to deradicalize violent radicals. I \r\ncannot help but think that the human disaster we are \r\nwitnessing is also the result of a crushing defeat — that \r\nof politicians who favoured military solutions and the \r\nnotorious so-called preventive war.\r\nA few years ago, Belgium refused to participate \r\nin such an operation in Iraq. How can we not see that \r\nfrustration and humiliation have further strengthened \r\nradicalism? Things being what they are, we must \r\nnow deal with the emergency, and act, including \r\nmilitarily. But we must also consider the future and \r\ninvest sustainably in civil action. Everywhere, the \r\nestablishment of a State that protects its citizens must \r\nbe the priority. Strengthening the rule of law and \r\nimproving living conditions is the best crisis prevention. \r\nSuch responses are also much less expensive than the \r\nday-to-day management of uprisings and violence. In \r\nmany crises today, we see the States concerned in a \r\nposition of great weakness or even virtual failure.\r\nThe appointment of a new Prime Minister in Iraq \r\nsends the right signal of inclusion and tolerance. Let \r\nme mention other illustrations of this principle. With \r\nregard to the Middle East, this summer we watched \r\nin despair the launching of rockets in Israel and the \r\nmassive bombing of Gaza. More than 2,100 Palestinian \r\nand 67 Israeli lives were lost in combat. War is not a \r\nsolution. There is no other way to achieve peace — one \r\nbased on two States coexisting in security — except by \r\nreturning to negotiations. The status quo is obviously \r\nnot an option. We must put the settlement of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict back at the top of the international \r\nagenda. That settlement will also constitute an \r\nimportant factor in the stabilization and peace of the \r\nentire region and the world. Therefore, we welcome the \r\nefforts of President Obama in that regard, and we hope \r\nthat he will continue up to the last day of his mandate \r\nto work in that direction.\r\nThe Arab Spring is another example of what I \r\nam talking about. It was a legitimate revolution and it \r\nspeaks to true aspirations for democracy and prosperity. \r\nWe must note that in some countries, chaos and terror \r\nhave long reigned over democracy, while in others we \r\nare witnessing a return to State totalitarianism. In that \r\nregard, the international community must do everything \r\npossible to encourage democracy peace and prosperity.\r\nWith regard to Africa, with which Belgium shares \r\na long common history, it is in constant forward motion \r\nand far removed from common clichés. We must \r\nstrongly support its economic, educational and political \r\ndevelopment. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nin particular in the east of the country, putting armed \r\ngroups where they can no longer do harm is an urgent \r\nnecessity. In Sahel, Mali and the Central African \r\nRepublic, the fight against religious extremism is \r\nwhere our priorities should lie. We must also mobilize \r\nto support populations in Africa that are dealing with \r\nthe horrific Ebola epidemic.\r\nOn the fringes of Europe, we are seeing a broad \r\ndestabilization. Internationally recognized borders are \r\nbeing violated, and Ukraine is facing a major challenge \r\nto be inclusive and representative for both the minorities \r\nand the majority of the population in Ukraine.\r\nWith regard to Flight MH-17, in which six \r\nBelgian citizens died, the currently known facts are \r\nincriminating and we eagerly await the final report of \r\nthe independent experts, who must have free access to \r\nthe site and responses to all of their requests.\r\nWe will have peace only if tolerance triumphs \r\nover barbarism. And we must act together. Therefore, \r\nI welcome the American initiative to launch a process \r\nof reflection on the role of the United Nations in \r\npeacekeeping. The role of the United Nations in the \r\nprevention and settlement of conflicts is irreplaceable. \r\nIt is the only place where the representatives of the entire \r\nworld can talk to each other. To be sure, the functioning \r\nof the Organization should evolve and recognize that \r\nthe right to veto has sometimes been used to prevent \r\naction from being taken. I am open to the consideration \r\nthat has begun in that regard. However, the common \r\nhouse that is the United Nations should be preserved at \r\nany price and encouraged to act. That is why I would \r\nlike to thank our Secretary-General for his unwavering \r\nefforts to further improve its functioning.\r\nOur world continues to present us with insufferable \r\ncontrasts. Too many human beings are today living in \r\nextreme poverty. They do not have safe access to water or \r\nbasic health services and they suffer from malnutrition. \r\nWho can believe that people will resign themselves to \r\nsuch a situation and that there will not be yet another \r\nscandal if they do? The international community — the \r\nGroup of Seven and the Organization for Economic \r\n14-55113 9/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nCooperation and Development — are beginning to deal \r\nwith tax evasion. That is extremely important, as is the \r\nfight against corruption. There will not be great human \r\nprogress without a moralization of finance at the global \r\nlevel. Our responsibility in that regard is huge.\r\nToo many women and men do not have access to \r\na job or to housing, only because they are of foreign \r\norigin. Too many women are subject to moral or \r\nphysical violence only because they are women. Too \r\nmany people — lesbians, homosexuals, bisexuals and \r\ntransgender people — are persecuted and rejected only \r\nbecause they are different or they love differently. It \r\nis also our responsibility to denounce and combat all \r\ntogether and systematically those injustices and attacks \r\non human rights.\r\nAs a crossroads of many cultures, Belgium has \r\nalways been one of the most open countries in the \r\nworld. It has a high standard of living. And although \r\nI think they are still too great, the inequalities there \r\nare the smallest in Europe. That is largely due to the \r\ncivil support, which is organized by the Belgian State. \r\nIn particular, our health system is exceptional and \r\nis accessible to everyone. Moreover, Belgium is a \r\nmulticultural country both through its demography and \r\nits abundant and diverse migration. In our country, the \r\nrespect for the other and the culture of compromise are \r\npart of our cultural heritage.\r\nBelgium, like the European Union, is moving on a \r\npath of solidarity with peoples who are encountering \r\ndifficulties. We want to help them to achieve their \r\nlegitimate aspirations for a more just world. We must \r\nalso remain vigilant so that we do not fall into the trap \r\nof social regression and increasing inequalities. All the \r\nethical progress that we have achieved is precious and \r\nmust be preserved.\r\nI will conclude by saying that human fraternity is \r\nnot a utopia. It is what has often allowed us to make \r\ngreat progress. We must go beyond borders to form \r\nnew types of cooperation, reduce inequalities and bring \r\nabout new hope. The most powerful obstacle to war \r\nand violence is human fraternity. It is that fraternity \r\nthat will enable us tomorrow to better share the \r\nplanet’s resources, to offer a future to each and every \r\nchild and to make sure that peace reigns everywhere \r\nand for everyone. Members of the Assembly may rest \r\nassured that my country will continue to do everything \r\nit can to bring peoples together. We believe in sharing \r\nand solidarity, and we thus find it entirely natural to \r\ncontinue to support Member States in their many \r\nstruggles for peace and justice.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Belgium for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Elio di Rupo, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nBelgium, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nMrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming Her Excellency Mrs. Kamla Persad-\r\nBissessar, Prime Minister of the Republic of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMrs. Persad-Bissessar (Trinidad and Tobago): I \r\nwould like to thank and congratulate Mr. John Ashe of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, who during his time as President \r\nlaid the foundation and established the conditions \r\nfor formulating a new development agenda geared \r\nto influencing the sustainable development of the \r\nmembers of the General Assembly.\r\nI would also like to congratulate the new President \r\non his election to the presidency of the Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. His tenure comes at a time \r\nwhen the global family is facing very serious threats \r\nfrom the Ebola virus and from what I call the terrorist \r\nvirus, threats that demand that we all marshal our \r\nhuman, financial and other resources in a global \r\npartnership aimed at combating these modern plagues. \r\nThe President’s tenure also comes as we are about to \r\ncommence the second phase of our formulation of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. I am confident, as I am \r\nsure we all are, that he will administer and lead with \r\ndistinction.\r\nToday it is a privilege for me to share with the \r\nAssembly the perspectives of the Government of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago on our priorities for delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, according to the President’s \r\n10/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\naptly selected theme. Last year we considered how \r\nwe would set the stage for the process to be launched \r\nduring this sixty-ninth session on finalizing the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. I noted then that when we \r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) \r\nand introduced the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), a new chapter opened for the United Nations \r\n(see A/68/PV.10). That chapter would see the United \r\nNations positioned as a vehicle for assisting developing \r\ncountries, especially the most vulnerable, in their \r\nefforts to reduce poverty and hunger, and for providing \r\nan environment that would enable States to develop \r\ntheir economies and thus help their people rise out of \r\npersistent poverty.\r\nMeasures must now be put in place to spur a \r\nproactive rather than reactive approach to the issue of \r\ndevelopment in this transformative post-2015 agenda. \r\nWith the experience of the challenges and lessons \r\nencountered in the past 14 years in the implementation \r\nof the MDGs, we are now at a critical juncture in \r\nputting into operation the elements we agreed to at \r\nthe 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (Rio+20) so that they will constitute the \r\nfuture we want. The current model was built on what \r\nwe agreed to at the Millennium Summit, but in some \r\nways it has fallen short of the expectations of many \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nHowever, the Government and people of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago have been able to achieve this objective \r\nbecause it formed an integral part of our 2011 medium-\r\nterm policy framework, through which we incorporated \r\nand aligned the MDGs and their targets with Trinidad \r\nand Tobago’s medium-term national priorities. \r\nConsequently, some of the goals, targets and indicators \r\nwere modified in the light of Trinidad and Tobago’s \r\nunique development circumstances and its achievement \r\nof several of the MDGs. That approach resulted in, \r\nfor example, modified targets for education, including \r\nachieving universal early-childhood education and a \r\n60 per cent participation rate in tertiary education.\r\nHowever, I am delighted to say that we have \r\nsurpassed many of our own targets, as well as some \r\nof the MDGs. So in Trinidad and Tobago we now \r\nhave universal free primary- and secondary-school \r\neducation, and, as I said, we have surpassed our target \r\nof 60 per cent in the tertiary sector and have 65 per \r\ncent participation. That too is free. I am also pleased \r\nto underscore that my country is well poised to achieve \r\n70 per cent of the 43 targets across the eight goals that \r\nare considered relevant to the national context. That \r\npercentage consists of 42 per cent of targets that have \r\nalready been met and 28 per cent that are likely to be \r\nmet by 2015. So we say that with good success, and \r\nlessons learned, we know what we still have to work on.\r\nI now turn to a short discussion of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM). Trinidad and Tobago, as part \r\nof the CARICOM region and the global community, \r\nwelcomes the outcomes of the various milestones in \r\nthe process we have achieved to date. As a member of \r\nCARICOM, we have been an active participant in the \r\nOpen Working Group on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We have therefore been witness to the sweeping \r\nand unprecedented global participation and interest in \r\nthat process and its outcome. As a collective effort, \r\nthe crafting of the sustainable development goals \r\nundoubtedly captured a spirit of openness, inclusiveness \r\nand partnership, all of which underpin this new phase \r\nof policy design and implementation. Along with the \r\nreport of the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts \r\non Sustainable Development Financing (A/69/315), the \r\n17 goals adopted in July form a solid foundation.\r\nIt is my respectful view that in delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda we must and should prioritize key issues for this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. I have identified four \r\nsuch priorities. The first, I believe, is for us to renew \r\nour commitment to achieving the MDGs. Even in the \r\none year we have left, with more dedicated effort we \r\ncan make further advances on our original objectives. \r\nAs the MDG Gap Task Force Report, 2014: The State \r\nof the Global Partnership for Development highlights, \r\nalthough progress has been made in some areas, the \r\ngains must be accelerated and in some areas a renewed \r\neffort is needed to close the glaring gaps that still exist. \r\nSome of those gaps are in important areas such as \r\naccess to affordable essential medicines, and in long-\r\nterm debt sustainability, particularly for small States, \r\nwhich is an essential element of the global partnership \r\nfor sustainable development. Implementation will be a \r\nkey measure of our commitment to the aspirations for \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe second priority is operationalizing “The \r\nfuture we want” (resolution 66/288, annex). In the \r\nRio+20 Conference in 2012, we agreed on many of \r\nthe foundation elements for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Coming out of that, we now have several \r\nkey documents to further inform and guide us on \r\nthe way forward. We have, for example, the report of \r\n14-55113 11/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nthe Secretary-General’s High-level Panel on Global \r\nSustainability (A/66/700); the sustainable development \r\ngoals; the report of the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing; the \r\noutcomes of the structured dialogues on a technology \r\nfacilitation mechanism (see resolution 68/310), and \r\nthe 10-year framework of programmes on sustainable \r\nconsumption and production.\r\n“The future we want” also outlines some key \r\nemerging challenges that we need to urgently address in \r\nthe context of the post-2015 development agenda. Some \r\nof those issues, as the Assembly will recall, include \r\nnon-communicable diseases, the increasing urgency \r\nto address climate change, and the imperative of \r\naddressing the needs of marginalized groups, including \r\nwomen, youth, children and persons living with \r\ndisabilities. Those are the building blocks of the future \r\nwe want to form the basis of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Together with the institutional support of the \r\nhigh-level political forum on sustainable development, \r\nthe reformed Economic and Social Council and the \r\nUnited Nations Environmental Assembly, we have a \r\nsolid foundation for fashioning a global partnership \r\nin support of poverty eradication through sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe look forward to the Secretary-General’s \r\nsynthesized report, which should place all of those \r\nelements in the context of a fully integrated post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and give due consideration to the \r\nneeds of countries in special situations, including small \r\nisland developing States, least developed countries, \r\nlandlocked developing countries and Africa. As a \r\nspecialized conference mandated in “The future \r\nwe want”, the outcome document (A/CONF.223/3, \r\nannex) of the recently concluded Third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States — the \r\nSmall Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities \r\nof Action — should also be appropriately addressed in \r\nthe upcoming Secretary-General’s report.\r\nThe third priority is for us to revitalize the global \r\npartnership in support of sustainable development. The \r\n8 August 2014 draft report of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing has highlighted that current financing \r\nand investment patterns will not deliver sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In fact, it goes on to say that\r\n“[w]hile design and implementation of policies \r\nwill be on the national level, achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment will require international support and \r\ncooperation”.\r\nThose are the core prerequisites for a global partnership \r\nin support of sustainable development. However, in \r\norder make such a partnership meaningful, it is my \r\nrespectful view that it must also include the following \r\nfour particular elements.\r\nFirst, it must include reform in the international \r\nfinancial institutions, targeting on systemic failures \r\nand focusing on building resilience that can sustain \r\ngrowth in open and vulnerable economies.\r\nSecondly, it must include the successful completion \r\nof the Doha Round of trade negotiations, which will \r\nensure that the rules of trade and commerce do not \r\ncontinue to operate so as to slow, impede or negate \r\ndevelopment gains and aspirations in our very small \r\nand vulnerable economies. I note that the third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nis scheduled to take place in July 2015. That will be \r\ncritically important to ensuring that a meaningful \r\nand effective global partnership for development will \r\nbecome a reality for the implementation of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nThirdly, on the point of a revitalized global \r\npartnership in support of sustainable development, I \r\nwish to strongly reiterate the support of Trinidad and \r\nTobago for an end to the economic embargo against \r\nCuba. The perpetuation of those measures against \r\na developing country undermines our collective \r\naspirations for a post-2015 development agenda in \r\nwhich no one should be left behind.\r\nFourthly, our priority should be for us to address \r\nthe mitigation gap for achieving the target of below \r\n2 or 1.5˚C target for limiting the increase in global \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and achieving an ambitious, \r\nlegally binding agreement on climate change in 2015 \r\nto be applied from 2020. That agreement should set \r\nthe world on track to achieving carbon neutrality by \r\n2070, and by so doing ensure that the global climate \r\nwill support the sustainable development of present as \r\nwell as future generations.\r\nOur collective action on climate change should \r\ntake into account the survival of the most vulnerable \r\nStates in particular, such as our small island developing \r\nStates, as the front line of increasingly severe impacts \r\nof climate change. It should also be firmly rooted in the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities, \r\n12/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nrecognizing that developing countries’ finance needs \r\nfor mitigation and adaptation to climate change cannot \r\nbe met exclusively from domestic resources, given the \r\ncompeting demands on public finance. I believe that \r\nevery Head of Government and every Head of State \r\nwould recognize those competing interests in their own \r\nnation States.\r\nIt is therefore essential to put the Green Climate \r\nFund into force early. It is my hope that the partnerships \r\nand announcements made at the United Nations Climate \r\nSummit 2014 on Tuesday, 23 September, will serve to \r\ncatalyse more ambitious action on climate change in the \r\nnear as well as in the long-term and build the momentum \r\nnecessary for a successful Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Lima in December and in Paris \r\nin 2015.\r\nThose are the elements of the global framework, \r\nwhich should occupy our full attention and commitment \r\nover the course of the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly. Those elements will be supported by critical \r\nenabling actions at the regional and national levels. \r\nFor us in the context of the Caribbean Community, we \r\nhave been doing our part as a subregion of small island \r\nand low-lying developing States to foster regional \r\nintegration in support of the sustainable development \r\nof all of our peoples. CARICOM Heads of State and \r\nGovernment have agreed on the vision of\r\n“a Caribbean community that is integrated, inclusive \r\nand resilient; driven by knowledge, excellence, \r\ninnovation and productivity; a community where \r\nevery citizen is secure and has the opportunity \r\nto realize his or her potential with guaranteed \r\nhuman rights and social justice; and contributes \r\nto and shares in, its economic, social and cultural \r\nprosperity. A community which can be a unified \r\nand competitive force in the global arena”.\r\nThat vision is the collective ambition of the States \r\nmembers of CARICOM, agreed in the context of a \r\nstrategic framework plan for period 2015-2019. That \r\nplan will come through the implementation of six \r\nintegrated strategic priorities, which include building \r\neconomic, social, environmental and technological \r\nresilience through a coordinated foreign policy and \r\nresearch and development innovation.\r\nIn support of the implementation of those six \r\npriorities, CARICOM Heads of State and Government \r\nhave called for a post-2015 development agenda that \r\nwill work in tandem with what we are discussing at \r\nthe sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly and \r\nneeds to focus on the eradication of poverty as a central \r\npillar, the adoption of a people-centred approach \r\nthrough an intergovernmentally agreed agenda, and \r\nan agenda that incorporates broader measures and \r\nappropriate approaches and criteria to complement \r\nthe gross domestic product per capita as a measure \r\nof development. Importantly, those broader measures \r\nmust foster an enabling global policy environment that \r\nis more conducive to the achievement of development \r\nobjectives and affords greater policy coherence across \r\ninstitutions, including those in the areas of trade, \r\nfinance, environment and development.\r\nThose regional initiatives in support of advancing \r\nthe sustainable development of the people of CARICOM \r\nare being designed and implemented in the context \r\nof a broader strategy for mitigating the vulnerability \r\ninherent in countries as small and open as ours, In \r\nthe context of a limited and narrow resource base, \r\nthe focus is on nurturing and developing our human \r\nresources through an emphasis on innovation and \r\nentrepreneurship. It is an approach that focuses on the \r\nfull realization of the human rights to development and \r\na life of dignity.\r\nConsistent with this approach, I turn to another \r\nmatter close to our hearts in the region as we continue \r\nto advance the global cause of truth, justice and \r\nreconciliation, within the context of reparatory justice \r\nfor the victims and the descendants of the trans-Atlantic \r\nslave trade. As a region we are determined to engage \r\nin reparatory dialogue with the former slave-owning \r\nEuropean nations in order to address the living legacies \r\nof these crimes. This is a critically vital element of the \r\nsocioeconomic development aspirations of the region as \r\nthe victims of these crimes and their descendants were \r\nleft in a state of social, psychological, economic and \r\ncultural deprivation. In addition, they have been left \r\nin a state of disenfranchisement that has ensured their \r\nsuffering and debilitation to this day, and from which \r\nonly reparatory action can alleviate their suffering.\r\nI hold that sustainable development cannot be \r\nachieved in an environment where people are denied \r\ntheir basic rights to live free from fear, with daily \r\ndeprivation of the necessities of life due to the ravages \r\nof war and other types of instability. It is for these \r\nreasons that Trinidad and Tobago is concerned by the \r\ndevelopments in Ukraine and other parts of the globe, \r\nwhich have caused pain and suffering to hundreds of \r\n14-55113 13/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\ninnocent victims. They too must be allowed to live \r\nfreely.\r\nAt the same time, we note with grave concern \r\nthe continued failure to find a lasting solution to the \r\ndecades-old Arab-Israeli conflict, which has caused \r\ntremendous loss of life and destruction of property in \r\nthe Gaza Strip, and has left emotional and psychological \r\nscars on those almost 2,000 families who lost loved \r\nones. Trinidad and Tobago remains committed to the \r\nnegotiation of the two-State solution as the preferred \r\nmeans to bring lasting peace to the region so that the \r\npeople of Palestine, so long denied their rightful place in \r\nthe international community, can live in larger freedom \r\nwith their Israeli brothers and sisters. To that end, we \r\ncall for the implementation of all relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions geared towards the resolution of the \r\nconflict and the lifting of the illegal embargo imposed \r\non the Palestinian people since 2005.\r\nLikewise, as co-sponsors of Security Council \r\nresolution 2178 (2014), on threats to international \r\npeace and security caused by terrorists acts, adopted \r\nat Wednesday’s summit, we remain optimistic that \r\nthe resolution may serve as a catalyst for greater \r\ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\r\nWe in Trinidad and Tobago have been the victim of \r\nterrorists in 1990, when there was an attempted coup \r\nagainst the newly elected Government by terrorists and \r\nextremists. Members will agree that this new terrorist \r\nphenomenon could be dubbed a terrorism “virus” as it is \r\nspreading throughout the global family. The Assembly \r\nwill agree that terrorism has been undermining, and \r\ncontinues to undermine, the sovereignty, territorial \r\nintegrity and peace and security of the peoples of the \r\nMiddle East and further afield.\r\nMembers of the Assembly will also recall that, in \r\nmy inaugural address to this body in September 2010 \r\n(see A/65/PV.20), I indicated that the time was right \r\nfor the adoption of a treaty to regulate the international \r\ntrade in conventional arms. That has now come to be \r\nhistory with the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty \r\n(ATT); after yesterday’s High-level Treaty Event, it \r\nnow has the requisite number of States parties for its \r\nentry into force, which is likely to be on 25 December \r\nof this year. We are very happy about that.\r\nThe entry into force of the ATT will require States \r\nparties to make important decisions to implement \r\nthe provisions of the Treaty at the First Conference \r\nof States Parties, which is likely to be convened by \r\nmid-2015. One of these decisions is on the location \r\nof the ATT secretariat. Over a year ago, my country \r\nannounced its candidature to have the ATT secretariat \r\nlocated in Port of Spain. That bid has been endorsed \r\nby all 14 CARICOM States and has so far received the \r\nsupport from a number of States from diverse regions. \r\nThe hosting of this important body in a region which \r\nis disproportionately affected by the illicit trade in \r\nsmall arms and light weapons and its association with \r\nother trans-boundary crimes, such as drug trafficking, \r\nwould be a significant development. It will assist in the \r\nfull and effective implementation of the Treaty, and \r\ncontribute to the reduction, if not the elimination, of \r\nillegal weapons in the hands of criminals whose actions \r\ncontinue to threaten the sustainable development of our \r\nregion.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is \r\ncommitted to providing the necessary resources to \r\nhost the secretariat, and this has been transmitted to \r\nall Members of the United Nations. I call once more \r\non all those States which have not yet announced their \r\nsupport for our candidature to do so and to ensure that \r\nthe principle of equitable geographic distribution in the \r\nlocation of major global bodies is observed. No country \r\nor region, in my respectful view, must continue to have \r\na monopoly in hosting important institutions which are \r\nestablished for the benefit of all.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is satisfied that, among the \r\n17 sustainable development goals adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 10 September, goal 3 ensures \r\nhealthy lives and promotes well-being for all ages. \r\nThe health and well-being of our people are critical \r\nto ensuring productive lifestyles which are critical \r\nto sustainable economic development, growth and \r\nachieving a transformative past-2015 development \r\nagenda. Health and well-being are one of the 10 thematic \r\nareas of development identified by the Government of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago.\r\nIt will be recalled that CARICOM, of which we \r\nare a member, was largely responsible for calling \r\nthe attention of the General Assembly to the need \r\nto adopt a resolution to focus attention of the effects \r\nof non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as a major \r\ncontributor to human mortality. Nevertheless, while \r\nwe continue to make strides in tackling the incidence \r\nof NCDs, we are cognizant of the need to combat the \r\nspread of infectious diseases within our region and in \r\ndifferent regions, which threaten the survival of people \r\nin many nations.\r\n14/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nSecurity Council resolution 2177 (2014), which \r\nwas co-sponsored by Trinidad and Tobago, garnered \r\nunanimous support, including that of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for dealing with the Ebola virus. We \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General. Members pledged \r\nto take action at the global and regional levels to combat \r\nthe spread of Ebola to supplement the United Nations \r\nMission for Ebola Emergency Response. Trinidad \r\nand Tobago remains committed to playing our part in \r\neradicating infectious diseases undermining the health \r\nand well-being of our people.\r\nIt is for this reason that, prior to the adoption of \r\nresolution 2177 (2014), on Ebola, as Prime Minister of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago I wrote to the Secretary-General \r\nof CARICOM requesting that a meeting of States \r\nmembers of the Community be convened to discuss and \r\nagree on sustainable policy responses at the national \r\nand regional levels alike concerning public health \r\nissues, including Chikungunya and the Ebola virus.\r\nFinally, the Assembly can rest assured of the support \r\nof the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in assisting \r\nthe United Nations family in shaping a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda. Our support will come \r\nnot only through our representation in the various organs \r\nof this global institution but also by continuing to adopt \r\npolicies at the national level geared towards putting \r\npeople at the centre of all developmental objectives. \r\nI say once again: any development agenda which \r\nalienates people or places them at the periphery and not \r\nthe centre will not bring sustainable development and \r\nwill be doomed to failure. Such failure stands against \r\nthe commitment we have all made and the purposes we \r\nare serving at the Assembly. Our work is cut out — for \r\nall of us, together in global partnership, to achieve the \r\ngoals that we have set ourselves.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago for the statement she \r\nhas just made.\r\nMrs. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Elmar Maharram oglu Mammadyarov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, \r\nI would like to congratulate my good friend Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I wish him \r\nevery success in fulfilling that highly responsible duty. \r\nWe are also grateful to Mr. John Ashe for all his hard \r\nwork in presiding over the sixty-eighth session.\r\nAzerbaijan reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the global sustainable development \r\nagenda and to reaching an agreement on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. My country’s record in attaining \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals is truly unique. \r\nOver the past 10 years, the gross domestic product \r\nof Azerbaijan has increased by 3.4 times. Now the \r\neconomy of Azerbaijan accounts for more than 80 per \r\ncent of that of the South Caucasus.\r\nThe unrivalled high rate of economic growth has \r\nbeen achieved thanks to the prudent use of available \r\nresources and the rapid transition to a socially oriented \r\nmarket economy. The poverty rate was reduced from \r\n49 per cent in 2004 to 5.3 per cent in 2014. Over the \r\nsame period, the unemployment rate has decreased \r\nfrom 10.6 per cent to 5 per cent. The Government \r\nhas been implementing large-scale programmes on \r\nimproving good governance, strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw, ensuring respect for human rights and providing \r\nfacilitated access to public services. Such programmes \r\nalso cover inclusive and equitable education, gender \r\nequality, the empowerment of women, better access to \r\naffordable energy and the protection of the environment.\r\nThe rapid development at the national level has \r\nenabled Azerbaijan to embark on a new road of official \r\ndevelopment assistance as an emerging donor. Over \r\nthe past years, Azerbaijan has continued to respond \r\nto the humanitarian and socioeconomic challenges \r\nfaced by developing countries through the Azerbaijan \r\nInternational Development Agency and other channels. \r\nThe commitment to contributing to international \r\ndevelopment is widely shared with our people. The \r\nleading non-governmental organization in Azerbaijan, \r\nthe Heydar Aliyev Foundation, has implemented \r\nnumerous social, humanitarian and development \r\nprojects in a number of countries.\r\nAzerbaijan has established itself as a reliable \r\nsupplier of energy in the global market. Just recently, \r\na groundbreaking ceremony to launch the southern gas \r\ncorridor was held in Azerbaijan. That $50 billion project, \r\nwhich envisages the construction of pipeline systems \r\nsuch as the trans-Anatolian and the trans-Adriatic \r\npipelines, will enable Europe to obtain gas supplies \r\n14-55113 15/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nfrom a completely new resource base in Azerbaijan. \r\nThe Trans-Eurasian Information Superhighway \r\nproject, which was initiated by Azerbaijan, will \r\nprovide the countries of the region with information \r\ntechnology services, thereby facilitating access to the \r\nInternet, telecommunications systems and electronic \r\ninformation resources for 20 countries throughout the \r\nregion. Acknowledging the value of transport as an \r\nimportant mechanism for sustainable development, \r\nAzerbaijan has successfully launched several regional \r\ninfrastructure projects. The Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway \r\nis an important link that connects Europe and Asia.\r\nAgainst the background of the various threats and \r\nchallenges facing the world nowadays, it is critical \r\nto persistently stress the importance of promoting \r\nkey values of different cultures, enhancing better \r\nunderstanding among diverse communities and \r\nencouraging mutual respect. Located between the \r\ntwo great continents of Asia and Europe, Azerbaijan \r\nis a unique place, where the East and the West meet, \r\nwhere the world’s main religions peacefully coexist and \r\nwhere the values and traditions of different cultures \r\nharmoniously complement each other. It is not a \r\ncoincidence that in recent years, Azerbaijan has hosted \r\nnumerous international events aimed at promoting \r\nthe dialogue among civilizations and enhancing \r\nunderstanding among different religions, faiths and \r\ncultures.\r\nViolence and fragility remain the greatest \r\nobstacles to development. The world community still \r\nfaces serious breaches of the fundamental norms and \r\nprinciples of international law. Peoples throughout \r\nthe world continue to suffer from devastating wars, \r\naggression, military occupation and ethnic cleansing. \r\nFor more than 20 years, Armenia has used force \r\nagainst the territorial integrity and sovereignty of \r\nAzerbaijan. It has occupied approximately 20 per cent \r\nof the territories of Azerbaijan and conducted ethnic \r\ncleansing against almost 1 million Azerbaijanis, as a \r\nresult of which no single Azerbaijani is left in Armenia \r\nor in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. No single \r\nAzerbaijani historical or cultural monument has \r\nescaped destruction in the occupied territories or in \r\nArmenia.\r\nIn 1993, the Security Council adopted four \r\nresolutions that reaffirm the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Azerbaijan and the inadmissibility of the \r\nuse of force for the acquisition of territory. Resolutions \r\n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) \r\ndemand the immediate, complete and unconditional \r\nwithdrawal of the Armenian occupying forces from all \r\noccupied territories of Azerbaijan. Furthermore, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation and numerous \r\nother regional organizations adopted various decisions \r\nin support of the sovereignty, political independence \r\nand territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and demanded \r\nthe settlement of the conflict on the basis of those \r\nprinciples.\r\nUnfortunately, Armenia disregards all of those \r\nresolutions and the generally accepted norms and \r\nprinciples of international law and continues its \r\nmilitary occupation of Azerbaijani lands. Armenia \r\nregularly violates the ceasefire and deliberately \r\nattacks Azerbaijani civilians, which results in the \r\nkilling and wounding of inhabitants residing near the \r\nfront line. Just recently, several Azerbaijani civilians \r\nwho were visiting the tombs of their relatives in the \r\noccupied territories were taken hostage and tortured. \r\nSome of them were even killed by Armenian forces. \r\nIt is therefore critical that the international community \r\nplay a more proactive role in ending impunity for the \r\ncrimes committed against the civilian population of \r\nAzerbaijan. Combating impunity is important in order \r\nto ensure sustainable peace and reconciliation.\r\nTwo days ago, the President of Armenia delivered \r\na statement here during the general debate and tried \r\nto mislead the General Assembly by distorting the \r\nfacts and the situation with regard to the peace \r\nprocess, misinterpreting the norms and principles of \r\ninternational law and the relevant documents adopted \r\nwithin that framework (see A/69/PV.6). The President \r\nof Armenia misuses the noble principle of self-\r\ndetermination to cover up his country’s attempts to \r\nannex territories of the neighbouring State, Azerbaijan, \r\nthrough the use of force. The situation, which he tries \r\nto present as the self-determination of the Armenians \r\nliving in Azerbaijan, has nothing in common with the \r\nprinciple of self-determination contained in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the Helsinki Final Act. In \r\nfact, the principle of self-determination requires the \r\nreturn of the displaced Azerbaijanis to the Nagorny \r\nKarabakh region, where they will live together with the \r\nArmenian community in peace, dignity and prosperity \r\nwithin Azerbaijan. We believe in achieving that goal by \r\npolitical means.\r\nAzerbaijan stands for a negotiated settlement of the \r\nconflict without prejudice to its rights under the Charter \r\n16/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nof the United Nations, in particular those set forth in \r\nArticle 51. The Government of Armenia must realize \r\nthat the military occupation of the territory of another \r\nState does not represent a solution and that its reliance \r\non the status quo is a grave miscalculation. Azerbaijan \r\nwill never allow its territorial integrity, or the rights \r\nand freedoms of its citizens that have been violated as a \r\nresult of aggression, to be compromised.\r\nThe international community’s unequivocal and \r\nconsistent support for the territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty of Azerbaijan has been a crucial factor. \r\nIt makes clear to Armenia that the current status quo, \r\nwhich was achieved as a result of aggression, will never \r\nbe accepted. I would like to thank Member States for \r\nupholding the letter and spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations by supporting the territorial integrity \r\nof Azerbaijan. The international community does not, \r\nand will not, accept attempts to change internationally \r\nrecognized borders through the use of force. Nor should \r\nthe world accept double standards. To do so would take \r\nus back to the dark chapters of the past century. In \r\nthat regard, the time is ripe to bring to justice those \r\nin Armenia who perpetrated acts of aggression against \r\nAzerbaijan and crimes against humanity and to impose \r\nsanctions on them.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Erlan Idrissov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Idrissov (Kazakhstan): On behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, I would first like to congratulate \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. We \r\noffer him our best wishes and full support. We also \r\nextend our special gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for his \r\nable leadership of the Assembly and his commitment \r\nto finding solutions to pressing international problems.\r\nThe world today is undergoing a major upheaval. \r\nThe global instability we face is a crisis of the global \r\neconomy, of international law and, in a broader sense, \r\nof a lack of vision for our world’s future. To our deep \r\nregret, it seems that not all States yet recognize their \r\nfull responsibility for the fate of their neighbourhoods \r\nand the world as a whole. Instead of well-thought-\r\nout, viable solutions, we are witnessing a disturbing \r\nescalation of problems, drawing in more countries and \r\nmaking our shared hopes of peace and stability ever \r\nmore distant.\r\nRivalry among the major Powers over perceived \r\nspheres of influence, markets and control over \r\nthe production and transit of energy resources has \r\nincreased. Tensions are on the rise, and the dangerous \r\nand unacceptable belief in the right of power in world \r\npolitics has strengthened. As a result, we are witnessing \r\na renewed arms race and the use of military force to \r\nimpose and extend influence. Unilateral actions and \r\ndouble standards are destabilizing the international \r\nsituation, exacerbating tensions, inciting ethnic \r\nand religious strife and threatening the security of \r\nother States. In today’s confusing media space, it is \r\nimpossible to distinguish lies from truth. This dire state \r\nof global affairs, rising tensions and mistrust between \r\nStates is undermining the efforts of the United Nations \r\nand entire international community to bring about a \r\npeaceful solution to any crisis by lawful means. It is \r\nalso deeply worrying to see the established architecture \r\nof international law being dangerously eroded.\r\nWhat is even more perilous is that radical \r\nmovements and extremist forces are skilfully \r\nexploiting the resulting uncertainty and instability in \r\nthe international system. We are particularly concerned \r\nabout the continuing violence in the Middle East and \r\nAfrica and the growing threats posed to some Asian \r\ncountries. We extend our deepest condolences to the \r\ncitizens and Governments whose civilians have been \r\nsenselessly killed during the violence.\r\nThe situation in Ukraine is of special concern to \r\nKazakhstan. The impact of the crisis now extends not \r\njust beyond the borders of Ukraine, but beyond the \r\nentire region. Kazakhstan supports peaceful initiatives \r\naimed at the speedy de-escalation of the conflict, \r\nincluding the Minsk peace agreements. The ceasefire \r\nmust be used to implement the peace plans of President \r\nPoroshenko and President Putin. These give hope for \r\nthe eventual stabilization of the situation in Ukraine. \r\nWe should also be concerned that the crisis in Ukraine \r\nhas led to mutual sanctions being imposed by countries \r\nthat together make up 60 per cent of the world’s gross \r\ndomestic product. That will certainly have a damaging \r\neffect on global development and economic growth.\r\nNow more than ever, the world needs to come \r\ntogether to find an alternative model to solving \r\nproblems, based on equal partnership, broad dialogue, \r\nmutual respect and tolerance among all stakeholders. We \r\nare confident that the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe fundamental principles of international law provide \r\nthe basis for this model. The role of the United Nations \r\n14-55113 17/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nmust remain pivotal and primary, while bringing States \r\ntogether and providing global leadership based on the \r\nequal participation of all Member States in the process.\r\nThe dynamics of our world today and the forecasts \r\nof what the future might hold must prompt world leaders \r\nto look beyond narrow national interests and to exercise \r\nthe highest degree of judgement and political will. What \r\nis at stake is nothing less than saving our civilization \r\nfrom destruction. This is not an exaggeration or \r\noverstatement. It is the harsh and threatening reality.\r\nWe are seeing a fundamental change in the structure \r\nof geopolitical, geo-economic and transnational \r\nrelations. What is emerging is a polycentric system \r\nof international transactions. Within that framework, \r\nnobody has the right to determine global and regional \r\nprocesses unilaterally. No country has exceptional \r\nrights or advantages. To help adjust to this emerging \r\nnew multipolar world order and promote the widest \r\npossible involvement in identifying the way forward, \r\nin 2012 the President of Kazakhstan proposed the \r\nG-Global initiative. It seeks solutions based on five \r\nprinciples, namely, a strong preference for evolutionary \r\nrather than revolutionary policy change; the crucial \r\nimportance of justice, equality and consensus; the \r\npromotion of global tolerance and trust; the need for \r\nglobal transparency; and, finally, the encouragement \r\nof constructive multilateralism. Unfortunately, the \r\ndecisions taken in the wake of the global financial \r\ncrisis by the Group of Twenty and the Group of Eight \r\nhave proved to be insufficient because they were not \r\nall-inclusive in their elaboration.\r\nKazakhstan therefore encourages Member States \r\nto use the G-Global platform for dialogue to help draw \r\nup plans — developed by all and acceptable to all — to \r\nprevent future global crises. We have already embarked \r\non that process through the Astana Economic Forum, \r\nwhich resulted in a draft anti-crisis plan offered to the \r\nUnited Nations. We believe that the plan should be \r\ntaken up by the General Assembly and the Economic \r\nand Social Council and given serious consideration.\r\nAt the forty-seventh session of the General Assembly \r\nin 1992, President Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan initiated \r\nthe convening of the Conference on Interaction and \r\nConfidence-Building Measures in Asia (CICA). Like \r\nthe G-Global initiative, CICA emerged from the firm \r\nbelief that international progress could come about \r\nonly through strong and effective partnerships, built in \r\nthe spirit of solidarity among all countries, regardless \r\nof their political and economic development. CICA has \r\nbecome an effective multinational forum for enhancing \r\ncooperation and promoting peace, security and stability \r\nin Asia. Kazakhstan supports the initiative of China, the \r\ncountry that chairs CICA currently, for a new security \r\nconcept for Asia based on the principle of common, \r\ncomprehensive, cooperative and sustainable regional \r\nsecurity. That will enable us to consolidate CICA in the \r\nnear future and transform it into the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Development in Asia.\r\nTwo weeks ago, the General Assembly held an \r\ninformal meeting to mark the International Day against \r\nNuclear Tests. We are pleased that all those present \r\nexpressed their determination to bring about a world \r\nwithout nuclear-weapon testing and, ultimately, without \r\nnuclear weapons. That is an issue close to the hearts \r\nof the people of Kazakhstan, who have witnessed and \r\ncontinue to live with the terrible legacy of nuclear \r\ntesting. That is why we proposed 29 August as the day \r\nto raise awareness of this important issue, and why \r\nPresident Nazarbayev has launched the Abolish Testing: \r\nOur Mission Project, a global education campaign on \r\nthe perils of nuclear testing.\r\nThe closure of the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test \r\nSite and the renunciation of the world’s fourth-largest \r\nnuclear arsenal — both inherited from the Soviet Union \r\nupon our independence — were defining moments \r\nfor our nation, and the starting point for the peaceful \r\nforeign policy we pursue today. Strengthening the \r\nglobal non-proliferation regime has remained one of \r\nthe most important priorities of Kazakhstan’s foreign \r\npolicy. The signing in May of the Protocol to the \r\nTreaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central \r\nAsia — the Semipalatinsk Treaty — by the five \r\npermanent countries on the Security Council marked \r\na major moment for nuclear security in our region. \r\nWe now urge the “nuclear five” countries to ratify the \r\nProtocol as soon as possible. We strongly encourage \r\nall stakeholders to uphold the provisions of Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), the \r\ncornerstone of the non-proliferation regime, and to work \r\ntowards the early entry into force of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe share the objectives of the proposed convention \r\non the general and complete prohibition of nuclear \r\nweapons. Again, we call on all Member States to adopt \r\nthe universal declaration on a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nworld. That would serve as the first step towards the \r\nadoption of the convention.\r\n18/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nReaffirming our commitment to the principle \r\nof the equal right of all countries to access nuclear \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes, Kazakhstan stands \r\nready to host the international bank of low-enriched \r\nuranium under the auspices of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We also support an \r\nearly political and diplomatic solution with respect \r\nto Iran’s nuclear programme, on the basis of strict \r\ncompliance with the provisions of the NPT and IAEA \r\nregulations. Kazakhstan helped break the deadlock \r\nin the negotiations by hosting the first two rounds of \r\nresumed talks in Almaty last year. We welcome the \r\nlatest 5+1 talks and strongly hope an agreement can be \r\nreached in November.\r\nWe, together with the entire international \r\ncommunity, are alarmed that terrorist groups are \r\ncreating quasi-State entities to fight legitimate \r\nGovernments and sow enmity and hatred. Religious \r\nextremism and separatism are fuelling a rise in \r\nterrorism, transnational crime and the illegal trafficking \r\nof narcotics. Kazakhstan was a sponsor of resolution \r\n2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist fighters, because we \r\nbelieve that the fight against international terrorism \r\ndemands a long-term comprehensive approach.\r\nWe also strongly believe that interreligious and \r\ninterethnic harmony are essential prerequisites for \r\npeace and security. Kazakhstan, a diverse nation of 130 \r\nethnic groups and many different faiths, has worked \r\nhard to build a culture of tolerance and respect. We have \r\nsought to promote those values internationally through \r\nthe Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional \r\nReligions, an event that has taken place every three \r\nyears since 2003. The Congress and its participants \r\nhave unanimously renounced violence and pledged their \r\nsupport for continued interreligious dialogue among \r\nleaders of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism, \r\nHinduism, Taoism and many other faiths. Just last week, \r\na preparatory meeting of religious representatives for \r\nthe fifth Congress, to be held in Astana in 2015, issued \r\na statement condemning extremism, violence and \r\nterrorism conducted in the name of any religion.\r\nKazakhstan initiated the suggestion that the period \r\n2013-2022 be proclaimed as the International Decade \r\nfor the Rapprochement of Cultures. Greater dialogue \r\nand the exchange of ideas between different cultures \r\ngreatly enhance international security.\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan in the wake of the \r\nrecent elections and the ongoing withdrawal of the \r\ncoalition forces is a matter of importance for the wider \r\nsecurity of Central Asia. We congratulate President-\r\nelect Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and the people of \r\nAfghanistan on the completion of the electoral process. \r\nWe look forward to close cooperation with Mr. Ghani \r\nand Abdullah Abdullah as they form, and work together \r\nin, the National Unity Government.\r\nEconomic development is key to Afghanistan’s \r\nre-emergence as a peaceful and prosperous nation and \r\ngood neighbour in Central Asia. Kazakhstan fully \r\nsupports Afghanistan’s integration into the region’s \r\nexpanding network of trade, energy and transportation \r\nlinks. We have taken practical steps to assist in the \r\nrehabilitation of our neighbour. The Government of \r\nKazakhstan has allocated almost $3 million for the \r\nconstruction of social infrastructure and has provided \r\nmore than $17 million in humanitarian food assistance. \r\nWe are spending $50 million to train approximately \r\n1,000 Afghan students in Kazakhstan universities. The \r\nfirst civilian students will soon successfully complete \r\ntheir education in Kazakhstan and join the peaceful \r\nreconstruction process in their home country.\r\nIt is clear that we in Central Asia face a number \r\nof challenges that endanger stability not only in \r\nspecific countries but in the entire region. There \r\nis regrettably little sign that those problems will \r\ndisappear in the near future. That is why the United \r\nNations and the international community need to \r\nwork more purposefully in Central Asia. Accordingly, \r\nKazakhstan’s call for the establishment of the United \r\nNations regional hub in the city of Almaty is highly \r\nrelevant. The United Nations plays an invaluable role \r\nin addressing natural and man-made disasters and \r\nassisting countries in their sustainable development \r\nthrough the coordination of the activities of national, \r\nregional and international actors. We believe that, with \r\nthe focus on humanitarian assistance and development, \r\nthe regional United Nations hub in Almaty would \r\ncomplement the work of the United Nations Regional \r\nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia in \r\nAshgabat, Turkmenistan. The presence of those two \r\nregional United Nations entities would cover a very \r\nbroad range of challenges faced by countries in our \r\nvast region, including Afghanistan. Of course, the \r\nGovernment of Kazakhstan stands ready to offer its \r\nfull support in establishing and developing the hub.\r\nSustainable development is central to Kazakhstan’s \r\nambitions for the future. We commend the United \r\nNations and the Secretary-General for convening \r\nthe action-focused Climate Summit a few days ago. \r\n14-55113 19/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nWithin our borders, we are working hard to achieve our \r\nnational plan to make the transition to a green economy \r\nand have recently adopted voluntary commitments to \r\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nA national system for greenhouse gas emissions \r\ntrading has already been put into operation. We are \r\nalso determined to support sustainable development \r\nglobally.\r\nIn 2017, Astana will host the international \r\nspecialized exhibition Expo 2017 on the theme “Future \r\nEnergy”, which will promote best practices in the \r\nfield of sustainable energy. We will provide support to \r\nrepresentatives of around 60 developing countries to \r\ntake part in Expo 2017.\r\nKazakhstan, in conjunction with the Economic and \r\nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, is launching \r\na project on the installation of biogas systems in nine \r\nsmall island developing States of the Pacific, which will \r\nhelp local communities produce electricity. At the same \r\ntime, Kazakhstan and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme are developing a training programme in \r\nthe sectors of oil and gas, agriculture and medicine for \r\ncountries in Africa, Oceania and Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean.\r\nAs the largest landlocked country in the world, \r\nKazakhstan attaches great importance to the upcoming \r\nsecond United Nations Conference on Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries, to be held in Vienna in \r\nNovember. The meeting aims to review and build on \r\nthe Almaty Programme of Action in order to produce a \r\nnew road map for landlocked developing countries that \r\ntakes into account the challenges and threats that have \r\nemerged since the Almaty plan was first developed, \r\nover a decade ago.\r\nIn 2015, we will finish construction of the \r\nKazakhstan section of the Western Europe-Western \r\nChina International Transit Corridor, which offers the \r\nshortest route from China to Europe and reduces transit \r\ntimes by up to 10 days, making it four to five times \r\nshorter than the sea route through the Suez Canal. By \r\n2020, we expect the volume of freight traffic on the \r\ncorridor between China, Central Asia, Russia and \r\nEurope to reach 33 million tons annually.\r\nThe construction of new rail routes is also bringing \r\nour region together as never before. This December, \r\nwe plan to open the Kazakhstan-Turkmenistan-Iran-\r\nPersian Gulf railroad, which will carry up to 10 million \r\ntons of cargo a year and allow us to increase our wheat \r\nexports five-fold. Another rail route, Uzbekistan-\r\nTurkmenistan-Iran-Oman-Qatar, which was first \r\nagreed in 2011, will also greatly increase international \r\ntransit capacity for our region.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, Kazakhstan is a candidate \r\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council for \r\nthe period 2017-2018. Its election would be a major \r\nstep for our country, which has never before served on \r\nthat body. Our extensive engagement in international \r\naffairs, including chairing key regional organizations, \r\nsuch as the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, \r\nhas given us the experience necessary to discharge that \r\nimportant responsibility. We believe that the priorities \r\nand challenges of our region should be represented in \r\nthe Security Council, and Kazakhstan is ready to play \r\nthat role.\r\nWe are a peaceful, stable and fast-developing \r\ncountry, with a reputation for impartiality and for taking \r\nan effective, balanced approach, with a strong focus \r\non international cooperation, conflict prevention and \r\nmediation. Overall, we are confident that we can fully \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace, \r\nsecurity and development, as well as the improvement \r\nof the Council’s working methods.\r\nOnly by working together, in a partnership in \r\nwhich all States Members of the United Nations are \r\ntruly equal, regardless of their level of political and \r\neconomic development or geographic location, can we \r\nachieve peace and security for all — a peace that is free \r\nfrom fear and violence and meets the needs of future \r\ngenerations.\r\nMr. Kogda (Burkina Faso), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nI would like to end by quoting Nelson Mandela, \r\nwho said:\r\n“People respond in accordance to how you relate to \r\nthem. If we approach them on the basis of violence, \r\nthat’s how they’ll react. But if you say we want \r\npeace, we want stability, we can then do a lot of \r\nthings that will contribute towards the progress of \r\nour society”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Abdulaziz Kamilov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\n20/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan): Today I would like \r\nto address some of the most important issues on the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda.\r\nFirst are the growing regional and international \r\nsecurity challenges and threats, escalating conflicts \r\nand wars, and the aggravation of geopolitical \r\nconfrontations between large centres of power, which \r\ncould produce new areas of tension in the world and \r\nmake it more difficult to address the continuing global \r\nfinancial and economic crisis. All those elements are \r\ncause for serious alarm and deep concern. Uzbekistan \r\nfirmly believes that such acute contradictions and \r\nconfrontations can be tackled only through a political \r\npath and peaceful means, in strict observance of the \r\nfundamental principles of international law enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe persisting instability in Afghanistan, which is \r\nexhibiting a tendency to escalate further, poses a serious \r\nthreat to stability and security in Central Asia and the \r\ngreater region. In the situation currently unfolding, the \r\naccelerated drawdown of the International Security \r\nAssistance Force may turn out to be counterproductive, \r\nand that could further complicate the state of affairs in \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nToday we can say with confidence that all the \r\nparties interested in resolving the Afghan problem \r\nare unanimous about one thing, which is that there is \r\nno military way to achieve peace in Afghanistan. The \r\nPresident of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, said so as long \r\nago as 2008 at a NATO Summit in Bucharest, and at the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s 2010 High-level Plenary Meeting \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (see A/65/PV.3). \r\nThe presidential elections in Afghanistan this year \r\ndemonstrated vividly that the Afghan people are tired \r\nof bloodshed and violence, long-standing misery and \r\ndevastation. Today they want peace and stability and \r\nthe right to define their fate on their own.\r\nThe only reasonable way to tackle the Afghan \r\nproblem is to search for a political settlement of the \r\nconflict through peaceful negotiations and achieve \r\nconsensus to establish a coalition Government in which \r\nall of Afghanistan’s parties in conflict and its national \r\nand religious groups would be represented.\r\nUzbekistan adheres to a policy of non-interference \r\nin Afghanistan’s internal affairs. We are building and \r\nwill continue to develop stable, friendly relations with \r\nAfghanistan that proceed from the national interests of \r\nboth countries, and, on an exclusively bilateral basis, \r\nwe will support the Government elected by the Afghan \r\npeople.\r\nSecondly, in view of the ongoing global financial \r\nand economic crisis, transport and communications \r\ndevelopment and strengthened regional economic \r\ncooperation are key factors for ensuring Central Asia’s \r\nstability and sustainable development. Implementing \r\nlarge transport and communications infrastructure \r\nprojects that can connect our region with global \r\nmarkets will promote interregional trade and economic \r\ncooperation, attract investment and help develop social \r\nand industrial infrastructure, as well as promote steady \r\nprogress in neighbouring regions. I refer in particular \r\nto such projects as the international Uzbekistan-\r\nTurkmenistan-Iran-Oman Transport Corridor, which \r\nwill link Central Asian countries to the Middle East \r\nby the shortest and most reliable and secure route. \r\nUzbekistan’s completion of the Hairatan to Mazar-i-\r\nSharif railway, the first and so far the only functioning \r\nrailroad linking Afghanistan to the outside world, was \r\na historic landmark event.\r\nThirdly, as the States of Central Asia, like many \r\nother countries, are experiencing growing water \r\nshortages, the fair and reasonable use of the resources \r\nof the transboundary Amu Darya and Syr Darya Rivers \r\nbecomes extremely important to the life support and \r\nwell-being of the population of Central Asia. Uzbekistan \r\nadheres firmly to the principled position that the issue of \r\nthe reasonable use of Central Asia’s transboundary river \r\nresources must be resolved according to the universally \r\nrecognized norms of international law and within the \r\nframework of the relevant United Nations conventions \r\non the use of international watercourses, which clearly \r\ndefine the principles of preventing damage to the \r\nenvironment and interests of neighbouring countries.\r\nWe believe it is unacceptable that certain countries \r\nin the region are promoting the construction of large \r\nhydropower stations with gigantic dams without \r\nconducting an international, truly independent, \r\nunprejudiced and professional expert study. \r\nImplementing such projects without thorough analysis \r\ncould exacerbate tensions and the potential for conflict \r\nin the region. Building such grandiose hydropower \r\nfacilities in a mountainous, highly seismic area with \r\na potential for earthquakes of magnitude of 9 points \r\nor highter could carry a high risk of devastating man-\r\nmade catastrophes. I wish to underscore that owing to \r\nthe potential for making ecological problems worse, \r\na growing number of countries around the world are \r\n14-55113 21/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nrejecting the construction of gigantic dams and opting \r\nfor small and medium-size hydropower stations that do \r\nnot damage the environment, safety or socioeconomic \r\nwell-being of their populations.\r\nFourthly, the dynamic development of our economy \r\nand modernization of all spheres of the country’s life \r\nhave enabled Uzbekistan to ensure the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ahead \r\nof schedule. Since achieving independence, Uzbekistan \r\nhas seen its economy grow almost five-fold and per \r\ncapita income increase 8.7 times, testifying to the \r\ngrowth in our standards and quality of life. In the past \r\n10 years, Uzbekistan’s annual rate of growth of its gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) has exceeded 8 per cent. By \r\n2030 we intend to increase the per capita GDP to $9,300.\r\nAbout 60 per cent of State expenditures are \r\nchannelled to fund social development, with more than \r\n34.3 per cent of that spent on education. Almost 100 per \r\ncent of school-age children attend secondary schools. \r\nWomen now represent 45.4 per cent of employed \r\npersons. We have achieved tangible successes in \r\nimproving maternal and child health, with the mortality \r\nrate among children under the age of 5 reduced by a \r\nfactor of 1.8 and maternal mortality rates by 1.6.\r\nFurthermore, Uzbekistan will do its utmost to \r\nachieve all its intended plans for the implementation of \r\nthe MDGs as soon as possible. We will also continue to \r\nundertake large-scale programmes in terms of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ali Ahmed Karti, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Karti (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\non behalf of the Republic of the Sudan, I would like to \r\nconvey to Mr. Sam Kutesa our sincerest congratulations \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. I also extend thanks and \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for \r\nhis wise and patient conduct of the deliberations of \r\nthe previous session. We hope that this session will \r\nculminate in concrete results on important, universal \r\nissues, in particular the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and the implementation \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda, which is a major \r\ntopic of discussion at this session.\r\nToday, I address the Assembly at a time when the \r\nSudan is on the threshold of an important new phase of \r\ncomprehensive political participation that excludes no \r\nparty, faction or group. On 27 January, His Excellency \r\nthe President of the Republic of the Sudan, President \r\nOmer Al-Bashir, launched an initiative for an inclusive \r\nnational dialogue, calling on the representatives of \r\nthe Sudanese people to sit at the same table to discuss \r\nsix major priorities: unity and peace, the economy, \r\nfundamental freedoms and rights, their identity, \r\nforeign relations and the issues of governance and \r\nthe implementation of the outcomes of the national \r\ndialogue.\r\nThe President’s appeal enjoyed an unprecedented \r\nresponse on the part of all political forces in the Sudan \r\nand the international community in view of the fact that \r\nboth the Government and the opposition were convinced \r\nthat dialogue was the only option at that time, as agreed \r\nby the people of the Sudan. There followed a succession \r\nof organizational and procedural consultations in order \r\nto translate the statement of His Excellency the President \r\ninto concrete steps. The initiative even found a positive \r\nresponse among the armed groups that still existed. I \r\nwould like to affirm the State’s intention to move the \r\ndialogue forward in the hope of achieving a national \r\nconsensus on the political future of the country.\r\nIn that regard, we greatly appreciate the ongoing \r\nefforts of the African Union and the African Union \r\nHigh-level Implementation Panel on the three major \r\npolitical, security and economic tracks. We call on \r\nthe international community to promote a positive and \r\nconstructive role in support of the Sudanese economy, \r\nin particular by lifting the unilateral sanctions, and by \r\ncancelling the Sudan’s accumulated debt, in line with \r\nthe aspirations for broader political participation.\r\nThe Sudan has continued to play an effective \r\nand positive role at the regional level on the African \r\ncontinent, with a view to establishing peace and \r\nstability in neighbouring States. When a conflict \r\nbroke out in the Republic of South Sudan, the Sudan \r\nadhered to the principle of non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of that country. The Sudan was the first \r\nState to provide humanitarian aid to those affected in \r\nSouth Sudan, and continues to do so. The Sudan is \r\nparticipating effectively with the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development so as to put an end to the war \r\nand to conclude a reconciliation agreement between the \r\ntwo parties to the conflict in South Sudan. My country \r\nhas received more than 100,000 internally displaced \r\npersons from South Sudan.\r\nIn that context, we recall the Sudan’s constructive \r\nefforts for the restoration of peace and stability in the \r\n22/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nCentral African Republic, thereby complementing other \r\ninternational and regional efforts. The Sudan is also \r\nactively working with Libya’s neighbours in assisting \r\nthe Libyan parties to reach an agreement on a solution \r\nto the Libyan crisis. Internationally, I underscore the \r\ntrilateral cooperation among the Sudan, Ethiopia and \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt in order to ensure the \r\ncommon enjoyment of the waters of the Blue Nile and \r\nto avert any negative repercussions in that country.\r\nIn that regard, we also stress the efforts of the \r\nSudan in the area of border control and demarcation \r\nwith neighbouring States in order to strengthen the \r\nborder posts and border monitoring and security \r\nand to prevent transnational crime, including illegal \r\nimmigration and the illegal transfer of small arms \r\nand light weapons. In that context, we appreciate the \r\nexperience of the joint border forces of the Sudan and \r\nChad, the Sudan and the Central African Republic, and \r\nthe Sudan and Libya as models of successful regional \r\nsecurity cooperation between neighbouring States in \r\nthe interests of peace and stability. In that connection, I \r\nwould like to recall that in mid-October 2014, the Sudan \r\nwill host a conference, in partnership with Italy, the \r\nEuropean Union and the African Union, on preventing \r\nillegal immigration, smuggling and human trafficking.\r\nConcerning the situation in the Middle East, the \r\nquestion of Palestine has continued to present a real \r\nchallenge for the international community for decades. \r\nIt has now reached a stage that requires the exceptional \r\nand prompt action of the international community in \r\norder to contain the situation and to move it forward \r\ntowards sustainable peace in the Middle East, through \r\nthe achievement of the legitimate and urgent demands \r\nof the Palestinian people, in particular the protection \r\nand reconstruction of what the Israeli war machine has \r\ndestroyed. The entire world’s ongoing disregard for the \r\ngenocidal war in Palestine and its failure to intervene to \r\nprotect the Palestinians and their rights fuel extremism \r\nin the region and throughout the world. As long as \r\nthe Palestinian people opt for a peaceful solution, it is \r\nimperative to support that direction in order to prevent \r\ndespair from spreading and the pursuit of destructive \r\nsolutions.\r\nWe fully accept and support the theme of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda as a major topic for \r\ndiscussion at this session. However, there remain only \r\na few months until the end of 2014 and we still have not \r\nachieved all the MDGs. We nevertheless remain very \r\nhopeful that we can overcome the obstacles that have \r\nimpeded us from achieving those Goals and that the \r\ndeliberations will culminate in a thorough preparation \r\nfor the development of viable post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nIn the United Nations Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2), adopted in 2000, the Heads of State \r\nand Government unanimously agreed a set of principles \r\nand goals that laid the foundation for an international \r\npartnership to put an end to people’s suffering and \r\npoverty. The year 2015 was designated as the deadline \r\nfor eradicating poverty and for ensuring well-being. \r\nHowever, the achievements reached on the eve of the \r\nend of 2014 are still short of our aspirations, since \r\npoverty, suffering, need, environmental deterioration \r\nand unemployment persist.\r\nThe agreement of the world’s leaders with regard \r\nto mitigating poverty requires that the obstacles to \r\nachieving such development be overcome. However, the \r\ndevelopment partners that drafted the Declaration have \r\nadopted actions that run counter to its provisions and \r\nto human rights. Such coercive measures as unilateral \r\nsanctions outside the framework of international \r\nlegitimacy have f lagrantly damaged the content of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration. That has had an adverse \r\nimpact on the noble principles and purposes of the \r\nDeclaration.\r\nIndications of the current situation in human \r\ndevelopment are that the Sudan has achieved concrete \r\nprogress in several fields, especially in peace, health \r\ncare, education and the standard of living. While \r\nacknowledging uneven degrees of progress between \r\nrural and urban areas, the Sudan has implemented a \r\nfederal system to promote the role of local communities. \r\nHowever, such progress has been greatly damaged as a \r\nresult of coercive and unilateral measures illegally and \r\nunjustifiably imposed against the Sudan, which have \r\naggravated and delayed initiatives, thereby negating \r\nthe Sudan’s role, and which continue to shackle the \r\ncountry’s economy. In that regard, I recall that the \r\ninternational consensus, achieved after the referendum \r\nin South Sudan that led to the separation of South Sudan, \r\nhad been to cancel the Sudan’s debts. A number of \r\nStates were assigned to do so in order to promote peace \r\nand development after the end of the war. However, that \r\nagreement has not been implemented so far.\r\nIn the Sudan, in the context of our established \r\ncommitment to the MDGs, we have formulated the \r\nrequired policies, which have gone a long way towards \r\npromoting several poverty-eradication projects and \r\n14-55113 23/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\ninitiatives, such as the establishment of a funding \r\nportfolio for small families and those with limited \r\nincome; programmes to recruit graduates and young \r\npeople in capital projects; the promotion of the role \r\nof women in governance and management; and the \r\nstrenghtening of the role of the zakat fund in promoting \r\nquick and short-term funds and other projects, which \r\nhave resulted in helping thousands of families to play \r\na productive role in paying the zakat. That is now \r\nunder consideration by the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation, so that it can be applied throughout the \r\nIslamic States.\r\nHowever, we must affirm from this rostrum \r\nthe importance of the commitment to a common \r\nresponsibility in achieving development objectives, \r\nbecause the international community must support \r\nand assist developing countries, especially the least \r\ndeveloped, which represent the segment more in need \r\nof support and capacity-building. That is why, in the \r\nlight of declining development assistance, we hope that \r\ndeliberations at this session culminate in our taking \r\npractical steps in financing development for developing \r\ncountries, especially those emerging from conflict. On \r\nthe basis of those measures and in order to guarantee \r\nserving the objectives of development, my delegation \r\nfeels it important to include the following requirements \r\nin the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nFirst, we should consider debt cancellation, providing \r\nthe necessary funding and renouncing discrimination \r\nand exclusionary political considerations. Secondly, \r\nwe should facilitate the transfer of development-\r\nrelated technology and information through advanced \r\ncommunications technology. Thirdly, we should \r\nsuspend coercive measures, sanctions and all kinds of \r\nillegal measures imposed unilaterally by States outside \r\nthe framework of international legitimacy. Fourthly, \r\nwe should launch feasible initiatives in North-South \r\nrelations, such as funding food-security projects, \r\nwhere my country can play a pioneering and effective \r\nrole in their success. Fifthly, we should help the United \r\nNations and its various organs to play an effective role \r\nin achieving their desired development objectives by \r\nproviding the mechanisms enabling them to do so.\r\nThis year’s general debate coincides with the \r\nUnited Nations Climate Summit, the outcomes of which \r\nwe hope will provide a strong impetus for the current \r\nefforts to address climate change and to turn the grave \r\nchallenge facing humankind into an opportunity for \r\njoint action in order to achieve a binding international \r\ncommitment to supplement the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, take \r\npractical steps towards a green economy, and reduce the \r\ncarbon emissions that threaten the safety of our planet. \r\nIn that regard, the Sudan, a State affected by the climate \r\nchange phenomenon, accords special importance to \r\nthe environment issue. We recall that the drought and \r\ndesertification that have hobbled Africa north of the \r\nequator are the living examples of the effcts of climate \r\nchange, which have led to tribal conflicts over sources \r\nof water and pasture. The Sudan’s involvement in the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme over the past \r\n40 years has been consistent with our concern in that \r\nregard.\r\nThe Sudan remains in an effective global \r\npartnership in the fight against terrorism at the national \r\nlevel. We have come a long way in harmonizing our \r\nlaws with international legislation and in working with \r\ninternational law and instruments relevant to fighting \r\nterrorism. We commit ourselves to those international \r\nlaws and reaffirm our commitment against all forms \r\nand manifestations of terrorism. At the same time, we \r\ncondemn any attempt to identify terrorism with any \r\nreligion, race or culture and call for the redoubling of \r\nefforts to enhance international and regional cooperation \r\nto stand up to terrorism. The phenomenon of terrorism \r\ncan be addressed and overcome only through a balanced \r\ninternational system based on equality and respect \r\nfor the established principles of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. In that context, we \r\nfeel that any unilateral action based on politicizing \r\nterrorism will not eliminate but exacerbate it. There are \r\nnumerous instances supporting that conclusion.\r\nIn conclusion, the Sudan affirms that international \r\nand regional security is an integrated, interconnected \r\nsystem and that the Organization has invested enormous \r\nefforts and resources in peacekeeping operations. It is \r\nnow time to do so, and we have significant experience \r\nin that regard. It is time for the Organization to invest \r\nin peacemaking and peacebuilding by supporting \r\ndeveloping countries and building the capacities of least \r\ndeveloped countries so that they can achieve the MDGs \r\nand peace and development can supplement each other.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Carlos Raúl \r\nMorales, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala.\r\nMr. Morales (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin my remarks by conveying our \r\n24/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\ngreetings to Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. At the same time, I \r\nwish to express our appreciation to Mr. John Ashe for \r\nhis recognized leadership and exceptional performance \r\nas President at the sixty-eighth session. I should \r\nalso like to take the opportunity to congratulate the \r\nSecretary-General for his stewardship and especially \r\nfor the success of the recent United Nations Climate \r\nSummit 2014.\r\nSince September 2013, when the President of \r\nGuatemala, Otto Pérez Molina, addressed the General \r\nAssembly (see A/68/PV.12), 12 months have passed with \r\nsignificant progress for Guatemala in three priority \r\nareas of our domestic policy, in spite of our having to \r\nface some new challenges, including a recent prolonged \r\ndrought.\r\nFirst, I can report that we have advanced in the \r\nbattle against chronic malnutrition among children. \r\nAccording to an independent investigation, in one year, \r\nthe program Zero Hunger has succeeded in reducing \r\nchronic malnutrition on the same scale as that achieved \r\nduring the past decade, that is, by almost 2 per cent. \r\nThat means that, should that trend be maintained, \r\nby the end of this Administration we will have been \r\nable to reduce the rate of chronic malnutrition beyond \r\nthat achieved since 1985, proving that democracy and \r\nappropriate policies would have enabled us to make \r\nprogress for Guatemalan children.\r\nSecondly, I would like to say that the Administration \r\nof President Pérez Molina has also advanced in \r\ncomplying with the Pact for Peace, Security and \r\nJustice. For the third consecutive year, the number \r\nof homicides in Guatemala has decreased, with a \r\ncumulative contraction of 25 per cent between 2011 \r\nand 2014. With that, we are coming closer to achieving \r\nthe same levels of security recorded after the Peace \r\nAccords were signed in 1996. That progress shows that \r\nthe measures taken are producing the expected results \r\nand that Guatemalan democracy is slowly winning its \r\nbattle against crime and impunity, in the framework of \r\nrespect for the law and compliance with human rights.\r\nWith regard to that second achievement, once more \r\nwe express our appreciation for the support received \r\nfrom the International Commission against Impunity \r\nin Guatemala (CICIG), an entity that has strengthened \r\ncriminal prosecution against mafia networks, some \r\nof which even infiltrated the security and justice \r\nestablishment. As the final year of the mandate of CICIG \r\napproaches, after nearly eight years of cooperation \r\nwith three democratically elected Governments, our \r\nassessment is that international cooperation programme, \r\nsupported by the United Nations, was fully justified, \r\nsince Guatemalan institutions today are better prepared \r\nto take on their constitutional role.\r\nMoreover, this last year will be critical to \r\nensuring the institutional sustainability of the judicial \r\ninvestigations and procedures already under way. \r\nWe thank the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity for joining us and leaving that great \r\nlegacy for Guatemala. Our country will now have the \r\nresponsibility of strengthening a system of security and \r\njustice capable of reducing impunity and ensuring the \r\ntotal separation between criminal networks and our \r\npublic institutions.\r\nA third advancement that I would like to share \r\nwith the Assembly has to do with competitiveness and \r\nthe business climate. In the past two years we have \r\nadvanced eight steps in the Global Competitiveness \r\nIndex, established by the World Economic Forum. In \r\nfact, the World Bank has highlighted us for the second \r\nconsecutive year as one of the most reformed countries \r\nin the world in terms of improving the business climate, \r\njumping 19 positions in the respective report. That \r\nis due to the actions of the present Administration \r\nin the framework of the Pact for Oversight and \r\nCompetitiveness.\r\nThat improvement in the business climate is \r\nabove all the result of administrative improvements \r\nthat have reduced bureaucratic procedures, supported \r\nadditionally by a progressive improvement in the \r\ncountry’s infrastructure. In addition, as we informed \r\nthe Climate Change Summit, our commitment \r\nregarding economic progress is made within the context \r\nof increasing sustainability. The change in the energy \r\nmatrix towards more sustainable and environmentally \r\nfriendly energy sources and away from fossil fuels, \r\nwhich produce greenhouse gases, is being achieved by \r\nbringing into the system more plants that depend on \r\nthe sustainable use of water, geothermal sources, solar \r\nenergy and even natural gas.\r\nIn that context, we have gone ahead with various \r\nstrategic agreements with our neighbouring countries. \r\nFor example, with Mexico, we can report on the projects \r\nto reconstruct and modernize border crossings on land \r\nand the signing of a historic agreement for a project \r\nthat will transport gas from the Gulf of Mexico to \r\nGuatemala and all of Central America. With Belize, we \r\nare moving forward and have negotiated 15 important \r\n14-55113 25/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nbilateral agreements in all areas, which we will sign \r\nin December. They will strengthen the relations not \r\nonly between our Governments but also between our \r\npeoples. In the Central American Integration System, \r\nwe are making progress in consolidating our integration \r\nprocess, and the next goal is to establish a customs \r\nunion. In addition, relations between Central America \r\nand the Caribbean are becoming increasingly intensive, \r\nguaranteeing greater markets and improved economic \r\nand political relations among our countries.\r\nIn the context of advances in the social, economic, \r\nsecurity and justice areas, we cannot forget some \r\nchallenges that have gained a higher profile during the \r\ncurrent year. In that regard, I must refer to the crisis \r\nof the Central American child migrants on the border \r\nbetween the United States and Mexico. The crisis, \r\nprovoked by diverse factors in both Central America \r\nand the United States, has alerted us to the need to move \r\nmore quickly on the path towards greater prosperity, in \r\nparticular for children and adolescents.\r\nWe trust that the people and Government of \r\nthe United States understand that the migrant crisis \r\nrequires a strategic response that attacks the structural \r\nroots of the phenomenon and provides sustained \r\nactions. That implies working together to promote \r\ndevelopment and prosperity in Guatemala, Honduras \r\nand El Salvador and intelligent management of seasonal \r\nwork for migrants that both satisfies the demands of \r\nthe labour market in the United States and provides for \r\nworkers from Central America. It is also important to \r\nmake the necessary efforts to regulate the situation of \r\nundocumented persons in the United States. Above all, \r\nmigrants must not be criminalized, because migration \r\nis neither a sin nor a crime. It is the networks of human \r\ntraffickers that are criminal, promoting corruption, \r\nextortion, kidnapping and sexual abuse.\r\nIn the same vein, I cannot fail to mention the \r\nchallenge posed by the shortage of rain this year in all \r\nthe Central American region. The drought has led to the \r\nloss of crops of basic foods for hundreds of thousands of \r\nfamilies, and addressing the food crisis will incur a cost \r\nof close to $50 million for Guatemala alone during the \r\nnext eight months. It is clear that the drought is a result \r\nof climate change and that, without decisive action by \r\nour Government and the solidarity of the international \r\ncommunity, many families will find themselves in a \r\nvery vulnerable situation due to hunger. The speeches \r\nduring the Climate Change Summit must translate \r\ninto direct humanitarian assistance that reaches the \r\nmost needy communities in Central America and the \r\nCaribbean. It is time to transform rhetoric into action.\r\nI would like to mention three important processes \r\ndriving the United Nations that Guatemala strongly \r\nsupports.\r\nFirst is putting together a post-2015 development \r\nagenda that must clearly embrace inclusive and \r\nsustainable development goals, including those related \r\nto promoting justice for all. In that context, we must \r\nalso incorporate specific goals to avoid man-made \r\nclimate change.\r\nSecondly, Guatemala is committed to supporting \r\nthe 2016 special session of the General Assembly \r\nto discuss the world drug problem. President Pérez \r\nMolina, together with other Presidents of the Western \r\nHemisphere, is determined to promote, through \r\nleadership, a frank and sincere debate on this issue, \r\nutilizing as a main reference the two declarations \r\nemanating from the General Assembly of the \r\nOrganization of American States during the past 18 \r\nmonths. During the most recent extraordinary session, \r\nheld a few days ago in my country, I was charged with \r\ntransmitting to the presidency of this General Assembly \r\nand to the United Nations Commission on Drugs and \r\nCrime the text of the resolution, which I will do in due \r\ntime. Our focus must be comprehensive, objective and \r\nevidence-based. And our goals must be realistic and \r\nmeasurable — no more dead products of the war against \r\ndrugs, no more false promises. A comprehensive focus \r\nis necessary.\r\nThirdly, Guatemala will follow up on the resolution \r\nand recommendations of the World Conference on \r\nIndigenous Peoples (resolution 69/2) and work to see \r\nthat the world recognizes the rights of the indigenous \r\npeoples as one of the basic platforms of the international \r\nlegal architecture of human rights.\r\nLike many of the heads of delegation who preceded \r\nme in speaking, I view with growing concern the \r\ndeteriorating security landscape facing various parts of \r\nthe globe. The exceptional cruelty of militant jihadist \r\ngroups leaves us astonished, and we energetically \r\ncondemn those crimes. We support all measures to \r\ncombat them, including in particular the elimination of \r\nthe root causes that lead many people to those levels of \r\nfanaticism.\r\nWe are also profoundly troubled by the instability \r\nin the Middle East, especially by the prolonged conflict \r\nin Syria, which has already taken an immense toll in \r\n26/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nlives and human suffering. We are concerned that in \r\nCentral Europe principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, such as respect for territorial \r\nintegrity, are being put to the test. We also remain \r\nconcerned about tensions in various countries on the \r\nAfrican continent and on the Korean peninsula.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations offers the ideal \r\nvenue in which to address those conflicts and tensions, \r\nand we reiterate our hope that dialogue, agreement \r\nand preventive diplomacy will take precedence over \r\nthe use of force. In that respect, we pin our hopes on \r\na negotiated outcome of the long-standing conflict \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine with the emergence of two \r\nStates, living in peace within secure borders.\r\nI end my remarks by repeating what President \r\nOtto Pérez Molina said last year to the Assembly, \r\nwhen he congratulated the United Nations system for \r\nits ongoing commitment to seek peace and justice \r\nworldwide. Guatemala aligns itself with that statement \r\nand those same goals and can affirm with pride that we \r\nare and will always be a country that is guided by the \r\nprinciples set out in the Charter of the Organization. \r\nThat sentiment is reflected in our commitment to \r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Harry Kalaba, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Kalaba (Zambia): I extend our sincere \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. We see him undertaking that onerous task \r\nat a particularly important moment in not only the \r\nforging of the future global development agenda, but \r\nthe development of international peace and security. I \r\ntherefore assure him of my Government’s support as \r\nhe sets out to discharge that important assignment. In \r\nthe same spirit, I also convey our appreciation for the \r\ncontribution made by his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\r\nI wish to highlight our deep concern at the global \r\nhealth emergency that has resulted from the Ebola \r\noutbreak in parts of Africa. That burden is not only \r\nfor the people of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea; \r\nZambia views the epidemic as a common challenge \r\nto humankind, and therefore stands ready to support \r\nall efforts required to defeat the disease and ensure a \r\nreturn to normalcy in the daily economic and social \r\nlives of our sister Republics that are directly facing the \r\ndisease.\r\nThere is growing acceptance and concern that \r\nEbola could easily spread beyond the first four \r\ncountries that have so far borne the brunt of the \r\ndisease. The recent resurgence of the disease in the \r\nneighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo is a \r\nreminder of the extent of the danger. Beyond that, we \r\nremain deeply concerned that over 5,000 people in all \r\nhave been victims of the disease and 2,400 needless \r\ndeaths have already been recorded across the continent. \r\nZambia therefore supports the call for greater and wider \r\ninvolvement by all Member States. The World Health \r\nOrganization has already warned that if the epidemic \r\nis left unchecked, we will soon be dealing with over \r\n20,000 Ebola patients.\r\nIt is equally for that reason that we continue to look \r\nat global health issues as important parameters for global \r\ndevelopment. The Ebola public health emergency and \r\nother ongoing challenges, such as malaria, tuberculosis, \r\nAIDS and other, non-communicable diseases, need a \r\nconcerted global approach.\r\nIn the past few months, the international community \r\nhas witnessed the growing desperation of extremist \r\nterrorist organizations, notably through the abduction \r\nof innocent schoolgirls in Borno state, Nigeria, and the \r\nwider reign of terror, which includes bombing civilian \r\ntrading points across that important African nation.\r\nZambia is also concerned about the insecurity \r\ncurrently being experienced as a result of the instability \r\nin Ukraine. We have followed the counter-accusations, \r\nwhich point to the deep-seated divisions and suspicions \r\nof a bygone era. Sadly, the human losses have been \r\nheavy, as ordinary Ukrainians are caught in the middle \r\nof a crisis that is strongly influenced by foreign factors. \r\nInnocent civilians from other nations have also been \r\ndrawn in through the loss of lives on Malaysia Airlines \r\nFlight MH-17. We share in the sorrow of the families \r\nand the nations that lost loved ones in that human-\r\ncaused catastrophe. Zambia believes that ordinary \r\nUkrainian citizens are of the same view and desire \r\nnothing but peace, harmony and prosperity for their \r\ncountry. They should be allowed to enjoy those basic \r\nhuman conditions.\r\nThose and other global security concerns linger, \r\nfacing a United Nations that is becoming ever more \r\nchallenged in coordinating any robust or convincing \r\nglobal response.\r\n14-55113 27/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is also \r\ntaking place at a moment of renewed focus on the \r\nglobal development agenda through the negotiations \r\non the post-2015 agenda and the work to produce \r\nthe sustainable development goals (SDGs). My \r\nunderstanding has been that the negotiations have thus \r\nfar been engaging and have included the participation of \r\nall stakeholders, including Governments, civil society, \r\nthe business community and academia. It can therefore \r\nbe said that we have laid a solid foundation upon which \r\nthe world will articulate its development policies for the \r\nnext decade and a half, in line with the three pillars of \r\nthe SDGs.\r\nWe look forward to the completion of those \r\ndeliberations, knowing that unless the means of \r\nimplementation are adequately covered with new \r\ninvestment inflows, we risk rendering that noble effort \r\na futile exercise. Given the immense challenges facing \r\nour nations, it is such multilateral approaches that will \r\naddress the underlying cross-border factors that affect \r\nclimate change, global poverty, public health, children’s \r\nwelfare, labour and migration, youth unemployment, the \r\nadvancement of women and many other issues whose \r\nsolutions lie in actions that may have transboundary \r\neffects.\r\nThe new global development regime must therefore \r\ndemonstrate a new and more robust approach to \r\nthose problems. For that reason, Zambia supports the \r\nrelated meetings being held alongside this session of \r\nthe Assembly, notably those relating to population and \r\ndevelopment, labour and decent work, and the 2014 \r\nClimate Summit. It is hoped that those discussions will, \r\nin the not-too-distant future, lead to lasting solutions \r\nto the development challenges faced by many of our \r\ncountries.\r\nOn another important matter, I wish to report \r\nthat Zambia has increased its campaign to forestall \r\nthe growing problem of child marriages and early and \r\nforced marriages. That problem is strongly rooted in \r\nthe prevailing poverty levels in some poor families \r\nand in the quest by organized criminals to profit \r\nfrom selling off under-age girls either into marriage \r\nor to engage in exploitative vices. With that national \r\nawakening to the problem, Zambia hosted a three-day \r\nnational symposium on the problem in July. We look \r\nforward to working with other nations to ensure that a \r\nglobal approach is developed to curb the incidences of \r\nchild, early and forced marriages, which is a problem \r\nwith greater consequences for the future advancement \r\nof women.\r\nZambia is also undertaking several other initiatives \r\naimed at reducing the gender divide. My Government is \r\nof the conviction that girls and women should be enabled \r\nand allowed to reach their full potential and be able to \r\ncontribute to national growth on an equal footing with \r\nmen. In that regard, the education of the girl child and \r\nthe socioeconomic empowerment of women through \r\ntheir representation in key decision-making positions is \r\nat the top of the national agenda.\r\nFurthermore, Zambia reaffirms its commitment \r\nto gender equality and the empowerment of women \r\nmade at the fourth World Conference on Women, held \r\nin Beijing in 1995, My Government has continued to \r\nstress the importance of women’s emancipation and \r\ntheir contribution to national development in line with \r\nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.\r\nThe question of the reform of the Security Council \r\nremains an important priority for Zambia and the rest \r\nof the African continent. We remain deeply concerned \r\nthat little progress has been recorded in the negotiations \r\non the expansion of the Council. Africa remains fully \r\ncommitted to all five clusters of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process outlined in decision 62/557, of \r\n2008. As a member of the African Union Committee \r\nof Ten on Security Council reform, let me echo other \r\nvoices in reiterating the importance that our member \r\nStates attach to the realization of those long-overdue \r\nreforms.\r\nMy delegation also accords due priority to the \r\nquestions relating to countries in special situations, in \r\nparticular landlocked developing countries (LLDCs), \r\nfor which group Zambia was nominated as Chair in \r\nMarch. The implementation of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action, as adopted in 2003, has run its course, albeit \r\nwith mixed results. It is coming up for review at the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, to be held in Vienna in just over a month’s \r\ntime, from 3 to 5 November. The 32 Member States in \r\nthat grouping are counting on the support of the entire \r\nUnited Nations membership to ensure a successful \r\nConference, which we expect will firmly place the \r\nLLDCs on a sound path of development. I therefore \r\nlook forward to the full participation of Member States \r\nat the Conference.\r\nI would like to end by informing the Assembly \r\nthat our historic capital city, Lusaka, has for the past \r\n28/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nyear been celebrating its centenary. That occasion was \r\nfollowed this year by two other important celebrations, \r\nnamely, the ninetieth birthday of our founding father, the \r\nfirst Republican President, Mr. Kenneth Kaunda, and \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of our national independence, \r\nwhich falls on 24 October.\r\nThe commemorations have offered a unique \r\nchance not only to celebrate, but also to reflect on \r\nour development path. I submit that within our known \r\ndifficult struggle to achieve social and economic \r\ndevelopment lies a strong national spirit, eager to \r\ncontribute not only to our own growth, but also to that \r\nwhich the growing global interdependence demands. \r\nLet me, on behalf of all Zambians, express appreciation \r\nto all those that have helped our beloved country in \r\nachieving those milestones. Zambia looks forward to a \r\nstrengthened and more versatile United Nations system \r\nthat will help create the conditions for the further \r\ngrowth and development of our youthful nation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting.\r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Singh (India): I take the f loor in exercise India’s \r\nright of reply to the unwarranted references made by \r\nPakistan’s Prime Minister in his statement. I would like \r\ndraw the attention of the General Assembly to the fact \r\nthat the people of Jammu and Kashmir have peacefully \r\nchosen their destiny in accordance with the universally \r\naccepted democratic principles and practices, and they \r\ncontinue to do so. We therefore reject in their entirety \r\nthe untenable comments made by the representative of \r\nPakistan.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I apologize for taking \r\nthe f loor. It was not my intention. However, I am \r\ncompelled to take the f loor to reply to the comments \r\nmade a short time ago by the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Azerbaijan.\r\nEvery time I hear statements based on falsified \r\ninformation, I never cease to be amused at what an \r\ninteresting phenomenon wishful thinking can be. \r\nHaving repeated the same lies year after year, one \r\nmight even think that the leadership of Azerbaijan has \r\nstarted to believe in what they have been lying about. \r\nBut as an oriental saying I once quoted goes, regardless \r\nof how many times one stirs the cup, the tea will never \r\nbecome sweeter. The reality is that no one buys the \r\nstory of Armenia being the bad guy and having taken \r\ncontrol of Azerbaijani lands.\r\nIt is probably easy to make statements when nobody \r\nverifies what one says and what is true and what is a \r\nlie. Anybody who cares to find out who is right and \r\nwho is wrong need only search for newspaper articles \r\nfrom 1988 on how the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \r\nstarted and how Azerbaijan responded with massacres \r\nand, afterwards, with a full-scale war unleashed on the \r\npeaceful Armenian population. Other relevant articles \r\nare those from 2004, when the ceasefire agreement was \r\nsigned between the authorities of Azerbaijan, Nagorno \r\nKarabakh and Armenia. Representatives can Google \r\nthem as well, but they should be careful as they might \r\nstumble upon Azerbaijani sites with an altered world \r\nhistory from the time of the Great Flood and Noah \r\nto our days. That is because all true information is \r\npersecuted in Azerbaijan, and all the bloggers writing \r\nthe truth are behind bars. Armenia has never had any \r\nclaims whatsoever on Azerbaijan, but the populations \r\nof the Nagorno Karabakh autonomous region expressed \r\nthe right to self-determination through their elected \r\nrepresentatives back in 1988, realizing their absolutely \r\nlegal constitutional right. In fact, the only aggressor in \r\nthat case was Azerbaijan itself, who responded with \r\nhostilities, massacres and war. And that is how it all \r\nstarted, with the aggression of Azerbaijan against the \r\nArmenians of Nagorno Karabakh.\r\nLet me give the Assembly a few facts, or rather \r\ndates, and whoever wants to do so can do the math. \r\nThe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics officially \r\nceased to exist on 26 December 1991. Azerbaijan \r\nheld its independence referendum three days later, \r\non 29 December 1991. The independence referendum \r\nwas held in Nagorno Karabakh on 10 December 1991, \r\nwhen the Soviet Union still existed. It resulted in the \r\napproval of independence by 99.89 per cent of voters. \r\nTherefore, by the time of the dissolution of the Union \r\nof Soviet Socialist Republics and Azerbaijan’s gaining \r\nof independence, Nagorno Karabakh was already \r\nindependent. Any intrusions by Azerbaijan against \r\nan independent Nagorno Karabakh constitute nothing \r\nelse but a blatant violation of international law and an \r\n14-55113 29/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nexplicit act of aggression against the Nagorno-Karabakh \r\nRepublic.\r\nI really cannot understand the logic of Azerbaijan’s \r\nstatement, which calls upon Armenia to comply with \r\nresolutions and/or decisions of international or regional \r\norganizations to which Armenia is not even party. \r\nThat is also something new, since there is a lot of \r\nground for legal novelties in that regard as well, and \r\nthat is also wishful thinking. Let us repeat the names \r\nof many organizations. Who cares if Armenia is not \r\nbound by those decisions and they have been adopted at \r\nAzerbaijan’s initiative, only sometimes through explicit \r\nblackmailing.\r\nIt is very obvious also why Azerbaijan constantly \r\nmentions some sort of attacks on Azerbaijani civilians. \r\nThe Azerbaijani militants, on a regular basis, kill, \r\nmaim and torture civilians and shoot at delegations of \r\nthe International Committee of the Red Cross on the \r\nborder. The hypocrisy is that Azerbaijan then starts \r\nblaming the victim for having been killed by the killers.\r\nThe Azerbaijani media widely publicize the \r\nspeeches of the President of Azerbaijan calling for a \r\nmilitary solution to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. \r\nThat is well documented, even on the President’s \r\nwebsite, whereas no politician, no analyst and no \r\nmedia source can provide a single example of similar \r\nstatements from the Armenian side.\r\nAnother fact is that the OSCE Minsk Group \r\nco-Chairs have suggested removing the snipers from \r\nthe line of contact. Azerbaijan is today the only party \r\nthat has openly rejected those proposals, continuing to \r\nmurder civilians with their snipers.\r\nAnother shameful lie is the charge of the destruction \r\nof Azerbaijani historical and cultural monuments. Once \r\nagain, the places have shifted. All of the civilized world \r\nsilently witnessed the destruction of the Armenian \r\nmedieval monuments in Julfa, Nakhchivan, which is well \r\ndocumented through videos, photos and eye-witness \r\nreports. They were not just Armenian monuments, \r\nthey were part of the cultural heritage of humankind. \r\nAnd they are gone now. Meanwhile, some of the few \r\nmonuments of Islamic art, which have nothing to do \r\nwith Azerbaijani culture, are under the strict protection \r\nof the State, and those that needed repair or renovation \r\nas a result of Azerbaijani shelling have been restored \r\nwith professional help by invited specialists. I would \r\ntherefore like to call upon on the Azerbaijani leadership \r\nto engage constructively in the Nagorno Karabakh \r\npeace process, in the name of finding a lasting solution \r\nbased on the principles of self-determination, territorial \r\nintegrity and the non-use or threat of use of force.\r\nMs. Mammadova (Azerbaijan): I am compelled to \r\ntake the f loor in exercise of my right of reply to the \r\nremarks just made and the allegations just raised against \r\nmy country by the previous speaker, whose statement \r\nseems to be a reflection of Armenia’s habitual moral \r\nand legal irresponsibility, as well as its distorted and \r\nmisguided sense of international law and history.\r\nIts obsession with consolidating the current status \r\nquo and finally imposing a fait accompli situation, thus \r\ntrying to equalize the responsibility of the aggressor, \r\nArmenia, and the victim, in this case Azerbaijan, now \r\ntakes new form as Armenia attempts to distort the \r\nobjectives of the four Security Council resolutions \r\n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993) and \r\nblame Azerbaijan for non-compliance. The Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, our most authoritative rulings \r\non the problem, contain important qualifications of \r\nthe actions of the Armenian side and declaring its \r\nclaims to the territory of Azerbaijan null. It should \r\nalso be recalled that the Security Council resolutions, \r\nwhich Armenia definitely has difficulty accepting \r\nand referring to, were adopted in response to the \r\naggression and invasion of an Azerbaijani district by \r\nArmenian forces. Besides condemning the use of force, \r\nthe Security Council demanded the full, unconditional \r\nwithdrawal of armed forces from the occupied lands of \r\nAzerbaijan. By speaking and blaming Azerbaijan for \r\nnon-compliance with the resolutions, one should ask \r\nArmenia: what about the occupation and the presence \r\nof the military forces of Armenia at this time on the \r\nterritory and lands of Azerbaijan?\r\nThe memory of Armenian officials conveniently \r\nlapses when it comes to the provision of those well-\r\nknown resolutions, which, inter alia, recognize the fact \r\nof the invasion and confirm the territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\nArmenia easily bargains away those sacred principles. \r\nNot surprisingly, the Armenian representative also \r\nbrazenly neglected the fact that, along with the Nagorno \r\nKarabakh region, Armenia continues to occupy seven \r\nadjacent districts of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The \r\nArmenian side also tends to conveniently forget to \r\nmention that the Security Council demand for an \r\nimmediate, unconditional withdrawal of foreign armed \r\nforces from the territory of Azerbaijan has yet to be \r\nimplemented.\r\n30/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nAnother question to be addressed is, how can \r\nAzerbaijan be responsible for the failure of Armenia to \r\nliberate the territories that Armenia occupies? Blaming \r\nAzerbaijan for non-compliance with the resolutions \r\nis a mere projection of the guilty conscience of the \r\nArmenian leadership, as Armenia itself has constantly \r\nand continually committed aggressions against \r\nAzerbaijan by occupying its territory since 1992. \r\nThat is the favourite — and, I would say, frequently \r\nused — argument of the Armenian side with regard to \r\nthe principle of self-determination.\r\nIt is a well-known fact that, under international law, \r\nthe principle of self-determination applies in reality \r\nto three categories of people — and I believe that \r\nthere is certainly a need for education in that regard \r\nfor one delegation — first, to people of sovereign \r\nStates; secondly, to people of territorial units formed \r\nduring colonialism; and, thirdly, peoples under foreign \r\ndomination, subjugation and exploitation, including \r\npeoples under foreign military occupation. There is \r\nno doubt that the members of the Armenian ethnic \r\nminority group living in the Nagorno Karabakh region \r\nof Azerbaijan do not fit into any of those categories of \r\npeoples and will never be considered an independent \r\nsubject with the right to self-determination. Yet another \r\nquestion to be addressed is: how many times can one \r\nnation exercise its right to self-determination? Armenia \r\nexists, and Armenians do live on that territory.\r\nThere were many things said about how Azerbaijan \r\nreplied with aggression. Once again, Azerbaijan cannot \r\nreply with aggression because Azerbaijan is the victim. \r\nHow can Azerbaijan be an aggressor if its own territory \r\nis under occupation and one eighth of its citizens have \r\nbecome refugees and internally displaced persons?\r\nWith regard to the comments concerning \r\ncompliance with the decisions and resolutions of regional \r\norganizations, that comes as no surprise given the fact \r\nthat Armenia does not respect the norms and principles \r\nof international law. If it contravenes, contradicts and \r\nchallenges the very provisions of the Security Council \r\nresolutions, then I believe it is no surprise that they \r\neasily overlook the references and decisions of regional \r\nand intergovernmental organizations.\r\nThe attacks on civilians and the massacres have \r\nbeen a trademark of the Armenian State’s foreign \r\npolicy. Very recently, the Ministry of Defence of \r\nArmenia claimed that captured Azerbaijani civilians \r\nwere saboteurs and criminals and could be considered \r\nprisoners of war. He stated that they had committed \r\ncrimes under Armenian law and that they would answer \r\nfor that pursuant to the requirements of “our laws and \r\ninternational norms”. That statement by a high-ranking \r\nArmenian official is yet further proof of Armenia’s \r\ndirect military involvement in the conflict and of the \r\nfact that the illegal separatist regime established in \r\nthe occupied territories of Azerbaijan is under direct \r\nmilitary command and control by Armenia’s armed \r\nforces. Those civilians cannot possibly be prosecuted \r\nunder Armenian laws, because they were on the \r\ninternationally recognized territory of Azerbaijan, \r\nwhich is not under the jurisdiction of Armenian laws.\r\nIt was also interesting and surprising to hear \r\nabout the pace of development and the human rights \r\nsituation in Azerbaijan. Armenia, a country with no \r\nparticularly stellar record in the area of human rights, \r\neconomic development or tolerance, has the insolence \r\nto charcterize the development of Azerbaijan, behind \r\nwhich it lags in many areas and which has been \r\nrecognized in terms of human development and global \r\ncompetitiveness, to mention just a few.\r\nIndeed, Armenia seems to be lost in the face of the \r\nneed to choose how to justify its deliberate policy to \r\noperate consistently outside international law, while \r\nat the same time portraying itself as an eternal victim. \r\nWhile continuing to deny its involvement and role in \r\nthe conflict, the Government of Armenia openly claims \r\nits ownership over the Nagorno Karabakh region of the \r\nRepublic of Azerbaijan and claims “to act as a guarantor \r\nof the security of the Nagorno Karabakh”. With regard \r\nto the question of Armenia providing guarantees and the \r\ncountry’s national security strategy of 7 February 2007, \r\nno explanation is provided as to how those guarantees, \r\nwhich affect a portion of Azerbaijan’s territory, fit into \r\ninternational law.\r\nIt is equally surprising to hear that Armenia is \r\nastonished by the attention or attitude of Azerbaijani \r\nsociety to Armenia. By attacking the Azerbaijani \r\ncommunity in Armenia, they were perpetrating acts of \r\naggression against Azerbaijan.\r\nThe expectation that Armenia can be friends with \r\nAzerbaijan while it continues to occupy Azerbaijani \r\nland also goes against conventional logic. Armenia’s \r\nproclaimed love of peace and its aspiration to have \r\nfriendly relations with all countries of the region, \r\nincluding Azerbaijan, have no weight or value against \r\nthe background of its policy of territorial expansionism \r\nand annexation even at the expense of the security and \r\nwelfare of its own population. In an attempt to defend \r\n14-55113 31/32\r\n26/09/2014 A/69/PV.14\r\nthe indefensible in the Nagorno Karabakh war, Armenia \r\nhas become a homeland that cannot sustain its own \r\npopulation, which is manifested in an unprecedented \r\nemigration from Armenia, low natural growth rates, \r\nrising poverty, heavy dependence on foreign aid and \r\nother development challenges, all of which is well \r\ndocumented in reports of international organizations.\r\nLet us therefore not make reference to some \r\npro-Armenian articles and then ask people not to scroll \r\nup the screen in their browsers to see what is being \r\nsaid in the Azerbaijani media. If we are inviting the \r\ninternational community to look up the facts, let us \r\nlook at them and face them. There has been aggression. \r\nThere is occupation in Nagorno Karabakh and in seven \r\nother adjacent districts of the Republic of Azerbaijan. \r\nClearly, there are many things the Armenian leadership \r\nshould learn, including how to promote peace, security \r\nand better standards of living for its own population.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I will not touch upon the \r\nSecurity Council resolutions issues, which were clearly \r\narticulated and well explained by my President two \r\ndays ago in his statement delivered during the general \r\ndebate in this Hall (see A/69/PV.6).\r\nBelieve me, there is no logic when somebody \r\ngrants that the people of Nagorno Karabakh voted \r\nfor independence and that the Azerbaijani authorities \r\nunleashed war on them, leading to the massacre of \r\nArmenian populations in Baku, Sungai and Kirovabad, \r\nbut then insists that the Nagorno Karabakh people \r\nthemselves or the Armenians are the aggressors. The \r\nNagorno Karabakh people have clearly expressed their \r\nlegal, constitutional right to do whatever they want and \r\nto have the status they want. Any military response to \r\nthat must be called aggression.\r\nI would also like to remind the Assembly that, while \r\nthe Armenians might be the minority in Azerbaijan, \r\nthey comprise the majority in Nagorno Karabakh. \r\nAs I said earlier, by the time that Azerbaijan become \r\nindependent from the Soviet Union, Nagorno Karabakh \r\nwas already not part of Azerbaijan.\r\nAzerbaijan also should have thought twice before \r\nunleashing war on Nagorno Karabakh, because doing \r\nso inevitably resulted in the loss of the seven adjacent \r\nregions, which came under the control of Nagorno \r\nKarabakh. They are probably forgetting the fact that \r\nthe continued shelling and bombardment from the \r\nAzerbaijani territories was targeted at the civilian \r\npopulation of the cities, towns and villages of Nagorno \r\nKarabakh, where people lived and had to hide in \r\nbasements in order to escape that bombardment. It is \r\na big question why Azerbaijan would bombard people \r\nwho were peacefully living in what Azerbaijan claimed \r\nwas Azerbaijan. It did not make sense to bombard them \r\nat all. But because they did it, it resulted in the loss of \r\nthe territories. Unfortunately, those are the rules of war.\r\nArmenia has also had refugees. They were \r\nmentioned previously by my Azerbaijani colleague, but \r\nnot until today. Armenia, with its limited resources, has \r\ndone everything to naturalize and find jobs and homes \r\nfor the entire refugee population of Armenia. We have \r\naccepted about 600,000 refugees in our country. I \r\nam surprised to see that, as of today, one out of eight \r\nAzerbaijanis is a refugee in what is an oil-rich country.\r\nAzerbaijan has used the tactic of “the best defence \r\nis a good offence”, hoping that it could blame everybody \r\nelse for what the world condemns them for. To cut a \r\nlong reply short, I will summarize that no Azerbaijani, \r\nespecially no Azerbaijani official, has any historical, \r\nmoral or legal right to tell the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nRepublic and the people of the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nRepublic how to live and how independent to be.\r\nMs. Mammadova (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\nmake just a few remarks.\r\nThe assertion that Nagorno Karabakh is independent \r\nis yet another outright lie. Armenia was, and still is, \r\ndirectly responsible for the creation of the subordinate \r\npuppet regime there. Its State policy of consolidating \r\nthe consequences of the occupation include, but are \r\ncertainly not limited to, providing political, military, \r\neconomic and financial means to the separatist regime, \r\nwithout which it could hardly survive.\r\nThe popularity of the idea of the so-called quest for \r\nself-determination among the Armenian leadership and \r\nsociety at large is also genuinely puzzling. By holding \r\nsuch a view, Armenia seeks to legitimize unilateral \r\nsecession, the use of force with annexation of part of \r\nthe territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, and the \r\nexpulsion and ethnic cleansing on a massive scale \r\ncommitted against the Azerbaijani population and all \r\nnon-Armenian minorities.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Armenian political and \r\nmilitary leadership aided large-scale expulsions and \r\nethnic cleansing to create a unique mono-ethnic culture, \r\nboth in the occupied territories of the Republic of \r\nAzerbaijan and in Armenia. That fact alone has been a \r\nmatter of concern for many international organizations, \r\n32/32 14-55113\r\nA/69/PV.14 26/09/2014\r\nincluding the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council \r\nof Europe. The idea of the ethnic incompatibility of \r\nAzerbaijanis and Armenians has been promoted by \r\nArmenia’s leadership, including its former President \r\nRobert Kocharyan in his notorious statement in 2002 at \r\nthe Parliamentary Assembly. By contrast, Azerbaijan \r\nis united in its diversity and proud to be distinguished \r\nfor the culture of religious and ethnic tolerance that \r\nprevails in its society.\r\nIt is also surprising to hear comments on moral \r\nand legal obligations and then hear about Armenia’s \r\ncommitment to those principles, when the incumbent \r\nPresident of Armenia has openly acknowledged its \r\ninvolvement in seizing Azerbaijani lands. He has \r\nclearly stated that he has no regrets about the deaths \r\nof hundreds of civilians in the town of Khojaly in \r\nAzerbaijan. I believe that when the Head of State \r\ntakes pride in his involvement in atrocities, no further \r\ncomment is needed.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.50 p.m.\r\n"
