I \r\nwould also like to thank your predecessor, Mr. John \r\nAshe, for his sterling conduct of the previous session, \r\nespecially his championing of issues relating to small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS). And I pay tribute to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exemplary \r\nstewardship in advancing the commitment of the United \r\nNations to building a more peaceful and prosperous \r\nworld amid the diverse and complex issues it faces \r\ntoday.\r\nMy delegation and I welcome the theme of this \r\nyear’s general debate, “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”, \r\nand we look forward to the three high-level thematic \r\ndebates and the high-level event to be held next year. \r\nAs we work together to formulate a historic post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, we are cognizant that we must be \r\nambitious and transformative in our approach in order \r\nto ensure tangible benefits for our people. Responsive \r\naccess to financial resources is essential if we are to \r\ncement the adoption of a meaningful development \r\nagenda and its full implementation.\r\nTonga supports the consensus that the report of \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals should be integrated into the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, with a global commitment to \r\neradicating poverty by 2030. The proposed sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals on oceans, seas and marine \r\nresources and climate change are woven intimately \r\nand intricately into the fabric of the very survival of \r\nPacific small island developing States. Without them, \r\nour joint aspirations for sustainable development and \r\neconomic growth will not be achieved, and we will \r\nbe left behind. The Small Island Developing States \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, known as \r\nthe Samoa Pathway outcome document, was endorsed \r\nby SIDS leaders and their partners earlier this month. It \r\nis a blueprint for the sustainable development of small \r\nisland developing States for the next decade and should \r\ntherefore be integrated into the form and substance of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn order to guarantee harmony in our implementation \r\nof the development agenda, Tonga agrees that each \r\ncountry should take primary responsibility for its \r\nown economic growth, social development and \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.15\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n15th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 27 September 2014, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nenvironmental sustainability. However, that can be \r\nfulfilled only with the active engagement of all relevant \r\nstakeholders through genuine and durable partnerships. \r\nWe look forward to working together towards the \r\nsummit in September 2015 when Heads of State and \r\nGovernment will adopt a post-2015 development \r\nagenda that will be inclusive and people-centred. It \r\nwill be a historic event, adding further meaning to the \r\ncelebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThis year, the Pacific island leaders endorsed the \r\nPalau Declaration on “The Ocean: Life \u0026 Future”, \r\nwhich is concerned with charting a course to \r\nsustainability. Tonga is a joint custodian of the Pacific \r\nOcean, whose natural resources form the bedrock of \r\neconomic, social and environmental development in the \r\nPacific islands. The well-being of the Tongan people \r\nis therefore premised on the sustainable development, \r\nmanagement and conservation of the ocean and its \r\nresources. The management of seabed exploration and \r\nexploitation is an important facet of Tonga’s interests \r\nin the oceans, and we have worked diligently through \r\nthe relevant institutions established under the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) \r\nto ensure that activity within the area located in the \r\nPacific Ocean is managed appropriately for the benefit \r\nof humankind.\r\nFor the first time, Tonga sought election to a seat \r\non the relevant body established under UNCLOS, the \r\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority, and \r\nwas elected by acclamation by its member States. \r\nThis year, Tonga passed legislation related to seabed \r\nmining activities within Tonga’s jurisdiction and under \r\nthe provisions of UNCLOS. We joined our Pacific \r\nIsland neighbours in supporting the call for launching \r\nnegotiations by September 2015 on an international \r\nagreement under UNCLOS on the management and \r\nconservation of the ocean and its resources, both within \r\nour national jurisdiction and in areas beyond.\r\nTonga commends the Secretary-General’s initiative \r\nin convening the recent Climate Summit as a forum \r\nfor world leaders to deliver bold announcements on \r\nclimate change mitigation and adaptation. In the spirit \r\nof sustaining international cooperation, we support the \r\nurgent call for States to address the adverse impacts \r\nof climate change. The collective response will depend \r\non the outcome of the ongoing negotiations being \r\nconducted through the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. Nevertheless, it should \r\nbe based on the principles of equity and common \r\nbut differentiated responsibility, as enshrined in the \r\nConvention. The principles and overall objective \r\nespoused by the Convention must be fully observed \r\nif the threat of climate change is to be effectively \r\naddressed and overcome for our common benefit.\r\nThe Global Risks Report 2013 ranked Tonga as \r\nthe second most vulnerable country in the world to \r\nnatural disasters. That vulnerability was demonstrated \r\nby our first category-5 cyclone earlier this year, \r\nwhich devastated our central island group, displacing \r\nthousands and resulting in millions of dollars’ worth \r\nof damage. However, and fortunately, it caused only \r\none fatality. Today, that same central island group is \r\nexperiencing an unseasonable drought. Tonga has \r\nused a whole-of-country approach — through its joint \r\nnational action plan on climate-change adaptation and \r\ndisaster-risk management — to establish a base from \r\nwhich to move forward with adaptation measures. In \r\nterms of mitigation, we are gradually reducing our \r\nfossil-fuel consumption.\r\nTonga applauds the convening of the high-level \r\nevent on combating climate change, and it would like to \r\nrecall here that Pacific island countries were among the \r\nfirst to raise the alarm on the implications of climate \r\nchange for security, both regionally and generally. In \r\nthat regard, we support the call to the Security Council \r\nto reconsider its stance and to recognize the links \r\nbetween climate change and international peace and \r\nsecurity. We also support the call to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to appoint a special representative on climate \r\nand security to research those links and report back to \r\nMember States.\r\nTonga associates itself with those Member States \r\nthat have appealed for a meaningful approach, going \r\nbeyond the rhetoric, to reforming the Security Council \r\nthrough an intergovernmental process in order to make \r\nit more representative and inclusive. We also support \r\nthe request of Heads of State and Government in the \r\n2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution 55/2) that \r\nits goals include the important work of revitalizing \r\nthe General Assembly. That general reform process \r\nmust continue if we are to ensure greater efficiency, \r\nrepresentativeness and transparency throughout the \r\nUnited Nations system as a whole, thereby enabling this \r\ngreat institution to be better prepared to respond to the \r\nrealities we live with today.\r\nFinally, for future generations to live in a better \r\nworld, we must work harmoniously to fulfil our \r\n14-55126 3/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nresponsibilities and ask the Almighty to guide us \r\nthrough our growing challenges.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank His Majesty the King of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Tupou VI, King of the Kingdom \r\nof Tonga, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President \r\nof the Republic of Mali\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Mali.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of \r\nthe Republic of Mali, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Keita (spoke in French): It is my great \r\npleasure, Mr. President, to convey to you warm \r\ncongratulations from the delegation of Mali on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. The unanimous vote that you received on \r\n11 June is an honour for your country, Uganda, and is \r\na source of legitimate pride for all of Africa. I assure \r\nyou of our fullest support for success in your new \r\nposition. At the same time, I wish to congratulate your \r\npredecessor, Ambassador John William Ashe, who so \r\nably led the Assembly during his tenure as President at \r\nthe sixty-eighth session. I should also like to pay tribute \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless \r\ncommitment to resolving the crisis in Mali and for the \r\nlaudable efforts he continues to make to promote peace, \r\nsecurity and development throughout the world.\r\nMr. President, you have established a useful \r\nagenda and opted for continuity in selecting the central \r\ntheme of the sixty-ninth session, “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”. I commend your choice. Indeed, since the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nin 2012, our Organization has been engaged in various \r\nintergovernmental processes to implement the slogan \r\n“The future we want.”\r\nIn Rio de Janeiro, States Members of the United \r\nNations took up the challenge to provide a better \r\nworld for current and future generations. To deliver \r\non that undertaking, we will require noble, ambitious, \r\nlegitimate and strong leadership, strong political will, \r\nconstant determination and insight so as to ensure a \r\nbalanced integration of the three essential pillars of \r\nsustainable development, namely, social, economic and \r\nenvironmental. What we have heard over the past few \r\ndays leads us to believe that it is feasible.\r\nHowever, as we prepare to embark on the design \r\nphase of the transformative post-2015 programme, we \r\nmust first complete a vital task. My delegation wishes \r\nto emphasize the need to ensure the full implementation \r\nof the substantial prior commitments we undertook. \r\nAccordingly, we want to make a heartfelt plea in favour \r\nof expediting the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In sum, I would reiterate \r\nthat Mali subscribes to the core theme of this session, \r\nwhich is relevant, thanks to its inclusive, universal, \r\nambitious and transformative aspects. The theme \r\nnot only includes all the essential components of the \r\noutstanding MDGs, but it also focuses on the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals (SDGs), which will be based on a \r\ntransparent intergovernmental process.\r\nLike other delegations, African and non-African \r\nalike, that have spoken before me, I remain convinced \r\nthat the eradication of poverty by 2030 should be a \r\npriority target of commitments relating to the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda that we are to adopt. Fortunately, \r\nthe contribution of Africa to the current process is \r\nalready formalized in the Common African Position on \r\nPost-2015 Development, adopted at the African Union \r\nSummit in Malabo in June. That joint position makes \r\nsocial, economic and environmental sustainability the \r\nkeystone of our continent’s development policy.\r\nBut the policy is also built on essential pillars, such \r\nas the transformation of economic structures, inclusive \r\ngrowth, science, technology, innovation, human-centred \r\ndevelopment, environmental sustainability, and natural \r\nresource and natural disaster risk management, as well \r\nas peace and security. Naturally, we strongly support \r\nthe African position, the relevance and rightness of \r\nwhich goes without saying. I also urge the international \r\ncommunity to diligently review the Common African \r\nPosition. The concerns of the continent listed in that \r\nposition statement were identified through a process \r\nconducted with care and precision.\r\n4/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nAs we approach the 2015 deadline, Africa is again \r\nfaced with a terrible epidemic of the Ebola virus, \r\nwhich has run rampant, this time in Guinea, Sierra \r\nLeone, Liberia and other countries of West Africa. The \r\nrapid onset and the scale of that new challenge have \r\nsorely tested all the public-health systems already in \r\nplace. The individual capacities of our States, which \r\nare fragile and in the process of being strengthened, \r\nwill not be sufficient to cope with the crisis. We must \r\npool our resources and redouble our efforts. We must \r\nattack the new epicentres. Today more than ever, it is \r\nimportant to adopt a common strategy to deal with this \r\nepidemic, which brings grief to numerous homes every \r\nday.\r\nI want to express our appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts, and, in these \r\ntimes of hardship, to assure our brother countries \r\nof our support and active solidarity. I also wish to \r\ncommend and thank various nations, including France, \r\nthe United States of America, China and Cuba, which \r\nimmediately responded with short-, medium- and long-\r\nterm assistance, provided swiftly and in a balanced \r\nmanner. The pledges made have laid a foundation that \r\nwill be instrumental, if not in completely overcoming \r\nthe challenge immediately, at least in mitigating the \r\npanic that has begun to spread in the affected countries.\r\nA year ago from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.15), \r\nI announced that my country, Mali, had rejoined the \r\ncommunity of free and democratic nations, with the \r\nfirm determination to write a new page in its history. \r\nI also announced the commencement of the dialogue \r\nprocess for peace and national reconciliation, which \r\nwe initiated in accordance with relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions and the Ouagadougou Preliminary \r\nAgreement, signed on 18 June 2013, between the \r\nGovernment and armed groups in northern Mali.\r\nSince that date, there have been significant \r\ndevelopments of a political and security nature \r\nrelating to the restoration of the authority of the State, \r\nthe protection of human rights, the development of \r\nhumanitarian action, the execution of the mandate \r\nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA), and the \r\ncoordination of development activities and partnership \r\nwith the international community. In that context, the \r\nGovernment of Mali has undertaken a wide range of \r\nactions, covering decentralization — that is to say, an \r\neven more radical devolution of powers previously held \r\nby the central Government — the promotion of national \r\nreconciliation and peaceful coexistence, development \r\neffectiveness in northern Mali, good governance and \r\ncombating corruption and impunity.\r\nThe momentum was strengthened by the \r\nGovernment’s organization of a series of meetings and \r\nopportunities for dialogue, including the Open Forum \r\non Decentralization and the National Conference \r\non Northern Mali. Those meetings enabled all the \r\nnational stakeholders to come together, in an inclusive \r\nand participatory manner, and to identify structural \r\nweaknesses in our political and institutional systems, \r\nas well as to lay the foundations for new democratic \r\ngovernance. That will take into account the profound \r\nrealities of our society, such as its ethnic and cultural \r\ndiversity and the strengths that have enabled the \r\npeople of Mali to ensure and maintain, throughout \r\nthe centuries and despite all the vagaries of nature \r\nand recurring political uncertainties, their social \r\ncohesion, customary resilience and basic aspiration to \r\na continuous improvement of their economic and social \r\nconditions.\r\nToday, in Algiers, with the support of the \r\ninternational community, Algeria is facilitating \r\na process that weaves the threads of an inclusive \r\ninter-Malian dialogue into a comprehensive and \r\npermanent peace. We thank Algeria for all its efforts \r\nto help Mali. We hope that peace will be sustainable \r\nand lasting and thus respond to the deepest aspirations \r\nof our people. A first round of talks, held in Algiers \r\nfrom 16 to 24 July, has led to the joint signing of a road \r\nmap on the basis of consensus and a declaration of \r\ncessation of hostilities in the northern regions of Mali. \r\nThe Government and the armed groups in northern \r\nMali have since then continued their discussions on \r\nwhat is called the second phase. Those discussions \r\nshould lead to deeper negotiations on a common vision \r\nfor the future, to gradually provide lasting solutions to \r\nall the points of disagreement and start the final phase, \r\nbefore ending with a peace agreement that will finally \r\nbe reached by the Malians themselves.\r\nI would like to once again thank the African Union, \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States, the \r\nUnited Nations, the European Union, the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation, Algeria, Burkina Faso, \r\nMauritania, the Niger, Nigeria, France, Switzerland \r\nand others, which I will not name but which deserve to \r\nbe thanked for their tireless efforts for peace in Mali.\r\nThere are also other challenges to which we, as the \r\ninternational community, must collectively respond, \r\n14-55126 5/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nespecially in the Sahel region, which includes Mali. \r\nThe terrorist attacks carried out in Libya, Nigeria, \r\nKenya, Uganda, Tunisia and the Middle East, although \r\ngeographically spread out, in fact represent the same \r\nserious threat to international peace and security. Here \r\nI would like to pay a special tribute to the memory of \r\nthe French hostage, Hervé Gourdel, who was recently \r\nmurdered in such a cowardly and brutal manner in \r\nAlgeria. The very same day, that same barbarity was \r\nillustrated in Mali, with the discovery of a decapitated \r\nhead hung up in a village marketplace. It belonged to a \r\nformer Malian soldier whose only crime was loyalty to \r\nMali and its Government.\r\nWe condemn terrorism, particularly when it is \r\ncarried out under the banner of religion. Islam has \r\nbeen present in Mali since the eleventh century, and \r\nit has been a tolerant and moderate Islam that is based \r\non humanism, the acceptance of others and the right to \r\ndifferences. That has nothing to do with the Islam we \r\nare seeing today.\r\nWe reiterate our profound gratitude to all those \r\nwho have worked for a return to peace and stability \r\nin our country. On behalf of the grateful nation of \r\nMali, we honour the memory of all the brave soldiers \r\nand civilians, from Mali and other friendly countries, \r\nwho have sacrificed their lives fighting against \r\nobscurantism, terrorism and violent extremism.\r\nThe 2012 political and security crises in Mali \r\nhighlighted the complex and multiple challenges \r\nfacing all countries of the Sahel in terms of security, \r\ngovernance, the protection of human rights and \r\ndevelopment. Those challenges require concerted and \r\ndiligent efforts by the international community. They \r\nshould be met with a comprehensive approach and \r\ntargeted mechanisms. In that regard, I welcome the \r\nadoption of the United Nations integrated strategy for \r\nthe Sahel, which offers a comprehensive and coherent \r\napproach to finding lasting solutions to the threats and \r\nchallenges that beset the Sahel.\r\nThe first ministerial meeting to establish a platform \r\nfor coordinating the United Nations integrated strategy \r\nfor the Sahel, held in Bamako on 5 November 2013, is \r\npart of that approach. After the meeting, the Ministers \r\nfor Foreign Affairs charged with coordinating the Sahel \r\ncountries agreed to hold meetings every six months with \r\na rotating chairmanship, which has been entrusted, for \r\nthe first two years, to my country, Mali. The second \r\nmeeting, also held in Bamako, on 16 May 2014, resulted \r\nin the adoption of the Malian chair’s road map, which \r\nfocused in particular on coordinating the efforts of \r\npartners and the national and regional ownership of the \r\nvarious initiatives and strategies for the Sahel.\r\nAs a final note on this subject, I thank the bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners and the financial institutions \r\ncommitted to supporting the implementation of the \r\ntargeted projects and programmes within the United \r\nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel. We also thank \r\nthe Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for the \r\nSahel, Ms. Hiroute Guebre Selassie, and Mr. Romano \r\nProdi for his efforts to reconcile the various points of \r\nview and to support Mali at the international level.\r\nMali remains firmly committed to the ideals of \r\npeace and stability, both within and outside its borders. \r\nI therefore welcome the progress achieved in terms \r\nof reconstruction and national reconciliation in the \r\nbrotherly country of Guinea-Bissau. The successful \r\nholding of presidential and parliamentary elections \r\nbolsters the restoration of constitutional order in that \r\nbrotherly country.\r\nRegarding the Central African Republic, Mali is \r\ndeeply concerned about the deteriorating humanitarian \r\nsituation there, and expresses its support for the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in the Central African Republic. We hope \r\nits rapid deployment will put an end to the escalating \r\nviolence and thus protect civilian populations in that \r\nbrotherly country.\r\nWith respect to the Middle East, we are following \r\nwith great concern the developments in Syria, Lebanon \r\nand Iraq, where the offensives of the terrorist group \r\ncalled the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant threaten \r\nthe sovereignty of that country and the stability of the \r\nentire region. To the Palestinian people, we express \r\nour solidarity in action and continue to work for \r\nthe implementation of the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions.\r\nMali remains firmly committed to the fight against \r\nthe proliferation of small arms and light weapons and \r\nthe eradication of the illicit trade in such weapons. To \r\nbe effective, that fight must be make use of the relevant \r\nsynergies. The consultation and cooperation framework \r\nat the regional and international levels offers such \r\nan opportunity. Similarly, the Government of Mali \r\ndeplores the erosion of multilateralism in the area of \r\ndisarmament, in particular the prolonged paralysis \r\nin the United Nations Disarmament Commission. \r\nHowever, we welcome the adoption by the General \r\n6/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nAssembly, on 2 April 2013, of the Arms Trade Treaty \r\n(resolution 67/234), as it represents true progress in that \r\narea.\r\nWe note that the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council have been ongoing \r\nfor two decades already. The main issues seem to \r\nbe the categories of membership, the question of the \r\nveto, regional representation, enlargement of the \r\nmembership, the Council’s working methods and its \r\nrelations with the General Assembly. It seems to us that \r\nall Member States are now convinced of the need for \r\na reform of the institutional framework of the United \r\nNations in order to strengthen its legitimacy and ensure \r\nits effectiveness.\r\nHowever, no significant progress has been made \r\nin the specific case of the Security Council, despite \r\nrepeated calls from this same rostrum and multiple \r\nmeetings on the issue. Africa, despite the fact that it \r\nrepresents 53 of the 193 States Members of the United \r\nNations today, remains the only continent that does \r\nnot have a permanent seat on the Security Council.\r\nThis situation is at odds with the values of equality and \r\njustice that are the ideals espoused by our Organization.\r\nAfrica came up with and submitted a Common \r\nPosition that was agreed on at Ezulwini, reaffirmed in \r\nSirte and subsequently confirmed during several other \r\nsummits. This proposal, a fair and realistic solution, \r\ncalls for granting the African continent two permanent \r\nseats with the right of veto and five other non-permanent \r\nseats. It seems to us that the Council, thus reformed, \r\nwould better reflect the geopolitical realities of today’s \r\nworld, and the historic injustice done to Africa would \r\nbe repaired.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like recall that we are all \r\ngathered here at the United Nations for the sake of \r\nan ideal and because of a universal desire for peace, \r\njustice and freedom. Millions of people around the \r\nglobe expect the United Nations to deliver peace, \r\nsecurity, development and international solidarity. We \r\nhave no right to disappoint them. As a community of \r\nnations, we have the duty and the means to succeed \r\nthrough collective awareness and the preservation of \r\nour common values. That is the price of guaranteeing \r\nfuture generations a sustainable development that would \r\nprotect them from the scourge of war and deprivation.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Mali for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Salva Kiir, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nMr. Salva Kiir, President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Salva Kiir, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kiir: I congratulate you, Mr. President, \r\nyour country, Uganda, and the African continent on \r\nyour election to the presidency of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session. My delegation and I pledge our \r\nfull support to you, Sir, in this important mission. I \r\nalso wish to congratulate Ambassador John Ashe for \r\nsuccessfully completing his term.\r\nWe are all bound by our moral duty and legal \r\nobligations to address the challenges confronting the \r\nworld today. We need to act in solidarity to promote \r\nglobal peace and security for the good of our nations. \r\nIn this context, I urge the United Nations and all Heads \r\nof State and Government to support the current peace \r\ninitiatives in the world, especially those in the Middle \r\nEast, the Central African Republic, Somalia, Mali, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic \r\nof South Sudan. We need to find appropriate ways \r\nand means to end these conflicts and many others in \r\nthe world, and to pave the way for all the nations and \r\npeoples of the world to live in peace and to enjoy their \r\nbasic rights.\r\nIn addition, the Security Council needs to be \r\nstrengthened to deal with new global challenges. \r\nTherefore, we support the call of the African leaders \r\nfor a comprehensive review of the Security Council \r\nto ensure that Africa and the other continents are well \r\nrepresented in this important international body, in \r\naccordance with the African position as stipulated by \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration. This \r\nwill create a more inclusive Security Council and \r\nempower all the continents to play a greater and more \r\neffective role in promoting global peace and security \r\n14-55126 7/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nfor the benefit of the human race. More importantly, it \r\nwill ensure that the Security Council continues to fulfil \r\nits purpose and be more able to achieve its mandate.\r\nThe journey of my people from conflict to \r\npeace, independence and freedom was costly. \r\nIt was characterized by economic and political \r\nmarginalization, a prolonged war, humanitarian \r\ndisasters, the loss of millions of lives and untold human \r\nsuffering. At independence, we acquired a country with \r\na multitude of challenges, ranging from weak national \r\ninstitutions and inadequate physical infrastructure to \r\nlimited human capacity and weak security mechanisms. \r\nWe are grateful the international community for its \r\nsupport and for continuing to provide humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment assistance.\r\nI have no doubt that the world has followed with \r\nshock and disbelief the violent conflict that erupted \r\nin South Sudan on Sunday, 15 December 2013, which \r\nwas plotted by my former Vice-President, who wanted \r\nto seize power by force. He was too impatient in his \r\nthirst for power. He did not want to wait for the general \r\nelections scheduled to take place in 2015, when he could \r\nhave sought a mandate from the people of South Sudan, \r\nas required by our transitional Constitution. The failed \r\ncoup and the ensuing rebellion resulted in the loss of \r\nmany innocent lives, the destruction of property and \r\ndamaged community relationships. However, the coup \r\nwas foiled, and the Government is continuing to defend \r\nthe country and the people against the rebellion.\r\nThe Government and the people of South Sudan \r\ntake this opportunity to thank the United Nations, \r\nthe African Union, the Intergovernmental Authority \r\nfor Development (IGAD) and the entire international \r\ncommunity for their prompt action to restore peace and \r\nstability in my country. My Government is unwaveringly \r\ncommitted to resolving the conflict peacefully, and my \r\nnegotiating team has been in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, \r\nsince January, talking with the rebels about peace, \r\nin order to close a dark chapter in the history of our \r\nyoung country and, on a new page, to pave the way \r\nfor us once again to embark on the difficult mission of \r\nsocioeconomic development, which our people urgently \r\nneed.\r\nWith the dedicated efforts of the mediators, \r\nwe were able to sign an agreement on cessation of \r\nhostilities between the Government of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation \r\nMovement/Army in Opposition on 23 January and to \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the agreement on 9 May. \r\nMy Government has demonstrated its firm commitment \r\nto peace, has unreservedly honoured those agreements \r\nand is continuing to negotiate in good faith to find a \r\npeaceful solution to the conflict. However, the rebels \r\nhave violated the agreements too many times and have \r\nrefused to sign the Protocol Agreement, which is a \r\ncrucially important document signed by the Heads \r\nof State and Government of IGAD, including myself \r\nas a party to the conflict. That important document \r\nforms the basis for resolving the crisis peacefully \r\nand inclusively. Therefore, I urge the international \r\ncommunity to prevail on the rebels to sign the Protocol \r\nAgreement.\r\nWe appreciate the fact that the international \r\ncommunity is rightly concerned about the humanitarian \r\ncrisis and human rights abuses that resulted from \r\nthe failed coup and the rebellion. In that regard, my \r\nGovernment has ordered an investigation into those \r\nabuses and has also accepted to cooperate with the \r\nCommission of Inquiry formed by the African Union to \r\ncarry out investigations into allegations of human rights \r\nviolations. We are determined to hold accountable \r\nthose who are found responsible, as we do not condone \r\nimpunity under any circumstances.\r\nMy Government recently signed into law provisions \r\nto guarantee freedom of expression in the media. It has \r\nalso ratified three United Nations core conventions, \r\nnamely, the Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Discrimination against Women; the \r\nConvention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman \r\nor Degrading Treatment or Punishment and its first \r\nOptional Protocol; and the Convention on the Rights \r\nof the Child, the Optional Protocol on the involvement \r\nof children in armed conflict and the Optional Protocol \r\non the sale of children, child prostitution and child \r\npornography. Those are all positive measures put in \r\nplace to address some of the concerns.\r\nThe conflict in South Sudan is purely a political \r\nstruggle for power and not an ethnic conflict, as has \r\nbeen reported. The citizens displaced by the conflict, \r\nespecially in the three states of Jonglei, Unity and \r\nUpper Nile, have sought refuge in the neighbouring \r\nstates of Lakes, Warrap, Central Equatoria and Eastern \r\nEquatoria and in neighbouring countries. Those \r\ninnocent victims of the conflict urgently need and \r\ndeserve humanitarian assistance. We therefore thank \r\nthe United Nations, the Government of Norway and \r\nthe stakeholders for organizing the donor conference \r\nin Oslo, Norway, in May to support our humanitarian \r\n8/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nneeds. We also deeply appreciate and welcome the \r\nhigh-level ministerial meeting on South Sudan that the \r\nUnited Nations organized on 25 September as a sideline \r\nevent of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly, during \r\nwhich a number of donors made pledges of support. \r\nMy Government is fully committed to providing \r\nhumanitarian access and has taken the necessary \r\nmeasures to facilitate access for humanitarian agencies.\r\nThe conflicts within our two countries of South \r\nSudan and the Sudan tend to be interconnected. \r\nThat is why we in the Republic of South Sudan will \r\nexert increased efforts to strengthen relations with \r\nthe Republic of the Sudan. Our oil f lows through the \r\nterritory of the Sudan. In the spirit of cooperation, \r\nmy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation will soon commence more joint visits with \r\nhis Sudanese counterpart to donor countries to appeal \r\nand lobby for lifting and waiving the Sudan’s foreign \r\ndebt, as was agreed in the Cooperation Agreement \r\nbetween the Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan. There are outstanding issues associated \r\nwith the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, especially \r\nthe final status of Abyei. The Republic of South Sudan \r\nand the Sudan are working through those issues with \r\nthe members of the the African Union High-level \r\nImplementation Panel mediation team and our other \r\npartners to find an amicable, peaceful solution with the \r\nSudan. 1 am committed to addressing those outstanding \r\nissues, and I am in direct communication with President \r\nOmer Al-Bashir of the Sudan to resolve those issues \r\nthrough dialogue.\r\nFurthermore, my Government and the people of \r\nSouth Sudan would like to state our appreciation and \r\nthanks to the countries that have expressed support for \r\nthe peaceful resolution of the conflict in my country, \r\nespecially the United States of America, China, Egypt, \r\nSouth Africa, the Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, \r\nNorway, the Congo and Namibia, together with many \r\nothers.\r\nMy Government is collaborating with the United \r\nNations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and other \r\nstakeholders, such as community leaders, political \r\nparties, civil societies and faith-based organizations, \r\nto build trust with the internally displaced persons in \r\nUNMISS camps and to encourage them to return to their \r\nhomes and their pre-conflict areas and resume their \r\nnormal livelihoods. With respect to our cooperation \r\nwith UNMISS, my Government would like to express \r\nits concern regarding the latest mandate of UNMISS, \r\nwhich has very serious implications for service delivery \r\nto my people. I note in particular that the new mandate \r\ndoes not allow UNMISS to respond to requests from \r\nnational, state and local partners for assistance in \r\nimportant activities connected with capacity-building, \r\npeacebuilding, disarmament, demobilization and \r\nreintegration, security sector reform, recovery and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that the activities I have \r\njust mentioned are of paramount importance to South \r\nSudan, we strongly believe that the main objective of \r\nUNMISS is to support peace and reconciliation first \r\nand foremost. We humbly request the Security Council \r\nto reconsider its decision when the UNMISS mandate \r\ncomes up for renewal in November. Also, we would \r\nfurther urge UNMISS to engage in reorientation \r\nof its activities relating to the mandate of protecting \r\ncivilians and to shift from protection-by-presence to \r\nprotection-by-action. This is very important because \r\nthe presence of troops that do not move does nothing to \r\nsave the civilian population. It is vital that they become \r\nactive. They must also encourage those in UNMISS \r\ncamps to return to their homes. UNMISS needs to \r\nprotect the civilians in their neighbourhoods, not in \r\ncamps, because ours is a huge country — larger than \r\nFrance.\r\nThe theme of the current session is “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”. It is no surprise that the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, as a three-year-old country facing \r\nnumerous challenges, will not achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Working Group for coordinating \r\nthe discussions on the 17 sustainable development \r\ngoals (SDGs), which will form the post-2015 global \r\ndevelopment agenda. It is vital that the SDGs focus \r\nnations’ efforts on reducing poverty; ending hunger \r\nand achieving food security; addressing our health \r\nconcerns, especially those issues affecting women \r\nand children; promoting gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women and girls; addressing the \r\nissues of access, equity and quality of education; and \r\ntackling youth unemployment.\r\nWe firmly believe that the attainment of the SDGs \r\nwill require strong, sustained partnership, collaboration \r\nand coordination at the international, regional and \r\nnational levels, and leadership from the United Nations. \r\nFor our part, we will spare no effort and will work in \r\nconjunction with the international community and our \r\n14-55126 9/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\npartners in the New Deal, as a fragile State member of \r\nthe Group of Seven Plus, to attain the new development \r\ngoals.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsolidarity and support to the victims of Ebola in the \r\ngreater West Africa region, particularly in Liberia, \r\nGuinea and Sierra Leone. We acknowledge the leading \r\nrole of the United States of America in assisting the \r\ncontinent to combat the virus. It is vital that the SDGs \r\naddress such global health threats.\r\nThe Republic of South Sudan strongly condemns \r\nall forms of terrorism, including piracy, which has \r\nbecome a menace to international peace and security.\r\nClimate change is now recognized as a major global \r\nthreat — a threat that could wipe out planet Earth \r\nand the entire human race. I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for convening the recent climate summit to \r\nfocus attention on this global problem, and I urge all \r\nthe members of the Assembly to heed the call of the \r\nSecretary-General and take bold action. I am pleased \r\nthat the SDGs cover environmental issues of concern \r\nto the international community, and I hope the climate \r\nsummit to be held in Paris in December 2015 will result \r\nin an agreement on a new global legal framework for \r\ntackling climate change. We must win the race against \r\nthe clock to save our planet and humankind before it is \r\ntoo late. To echo Ms. Graça Machel, tackling climate \r\nchange requires leadership, courage and ambition from \r\nall of us. Let us act in solidarity to create the future we \r\nwant.\r\nFinally, Sir, I reiterate my resolve to restore peace \r\nto the people of South Sudan, to fully implement the \r\ncooperation agreements with the Republic of the \r\nSudan, to provide unrestricted support to humanitarian \r\nassistance, to respect human rights and ensure \r\ndemocratic governance in my country, and to strengthen \r\nworking relations with UNMISS and all the members \r\nof the international community without exception. We \r\nwill work in unison to establish a safe, secure, peaceful \r\nand prosperous South Sudan.\r\nWe are all one in this world — whether strong or \r\nweak, rich or poor. Let us therefore stick together.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Salva Kiir, President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Ms. Catherine \r\nSamba-Panza, President of the Transitional \r\nGovernment of the Central African Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Transitional Government \r\nof the Central African Republic.\r\nMs. Catherine Samba-Panza, President of the \r\nTransitional Government of the Central African \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Catherine Samba-Panza, President of \r\nthe Transitional Government of the Central African \r\nRepublic, and to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Samba-Panza (spoke in French): It is \r\nan honour and a legitimate source of pride for me to \r\nspeak from this rostrum on behalf of my country, the \r\nCentral African Republic, on the occasion of the sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly of our shared \r\nOrganization.\r\nI would like first to address, on behalf of the \r\ndelegation that is accompanying me and in my own \r\nname, my warm congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Uganda, \r\nfor his election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. My congratulations also go \r\nto Mr. John Ashe, who successfully presided over the \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session, during which the \r\nsituation in my country was widely debated and was \r\nsubject to numerous resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nI would especially like to express all my gratitude \r\nand that of the people of the Central African Republic \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his dynamism \r\nand commitment to my country, a commitment that was \r\nembodied in his April visit to Bangui.\r\nIt is also especially important for me to solemnly \r\naddress members in this Hall to express the profound \r\ngratitude of the Central African people for the \r\ninternational community’s unwavering and tireless \r\ncommitment to my country in distress. That recognition \r\ngoes especially to the Heads of State of the Economic \r\nand Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC), \r\n10/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nthe Economic Community of Central African States \r\n(ECCAS), the African Union, European Union, and \r\nthe countries of the International Mediation under \r\nthe leadership of President Denis Sassou Nguesso of \r\nthe Republic of the Congo. It also extends to France \r\nand its President for their dogged determination, and \r\nto the United States of America and members of the \r\nInternational Contact Group on the Central African \r\nRepublic for their renewed and unflagging support for \r\nthe transition authorities in my country.\r\nThe sixty-ninth session is being held at a time \r\nwhen my country is still experiencing a worrying \r\nhumanitarian, security and economic situation that \r\nchallenges all of us as members of the international \r\ncommunity. The political instability and internal \r\nconflicts that have been recurring for more than two \r\ndecades have plunged the Central African Republic into \r\na situation of extreme vulnerability. Since December \r\n2012, the Central African Republic has been shaken by \r\none of the worst crises in its history, which has left the \r\nCentral African people in a dramatic situation.\r\nFollowing the resignation of my predecessor on \r\n10 January, I responded to the distressed calls of the \r\npeople of the Central African Republic. My election has \r\nraised great hopes among the people of my country, who \r\nwelcomed the election of the first woman President of \r\nthe Central African Republic as a sign of a break with \r\nthe past and the start of a new future. Since then I have \r\nfelt the weight of the responsibility that has befallen me \r\nand taken stock of the situation that I had inherited.\r\nWith determination, I immediately embarked \r\nupon dealing with the situation, with the support \r\nof the international community, in accordance with \r\nthe road map for the transition, whose main axes are \r\nthe restoration of security and peace, the resolution \r\nof the serious humanitarian crisis, the recovery of \r\nState authority throughout the national territory, the \r\nrelaunching of economic activities, and, of course, the \r\nholding of free, transparent and democratic elections. \r\nToday, I rejoice that my calls to the international \r\ncommunity to support the efforts of the transition \r\nhave not remained unanswered; we have been offered \r\nmultifaceted support, thanks to which the worst was \r\navoided in my country.\r\nThose combined efforts have resulted in noticeable \r\nprogress on security issues and humanitarian, \r\neconomic and political matters. In terms of security, I \r\nwelcome the Security Council’s adoption of resolution \r\n2149 (2014) on 10 April, authorizing the deployment \r\nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic \r\n(MINUSCA), which was a strong response on the part \r\nof the international community to the Central African \r\ncrisis and which led, on 15 September, to the final \r\ntransfer of authority from the African-led International \r\nSupport Mission in the Central African Republic to \r\nMINUSCA. I want to thank all States that have made \r\ntheir troops, materiel and financial contributions \r\navailable to the Mission.\r\nWe have placed high hopes in the deployment of \r\nthe Mission, which should contribute effectively and \r\nefficiently to securing the country’s path to peace and \r\nsustainable development. The fact remains, however, \r\nthat the success of the Mission will also depend on the \r\nclose involvement of the national security and defence \r\nforces, which can provide support to the Mission based \r\non their knowledge of the terrain.\r\nI would ask the Sanctions Committee to show \r\ngreat understanding and to reconsider the arms \r\nembargo imposed on the Central African Republic. \r\nAt the same time, it is also urgent to go beyond the \r\nBrazzaville forum, which resulted in the signing of \r\nan agreement to cease hostilities and opened the way \r\nfor the disarmament of all armed groups, the reform \r\nof the defence and security sectors, and especially the \r\nimplementation of the disarmament, demobilization \r\nand reintegration programme. In those areas, too, we \r\nwill need substantial backing from the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nIn the humanitarian field, efforts have been \r\nongoing since January. To date, the number of internally \r\ndisplaced persons has dropped from 900,000 to 175,000 \r\npeople, which means that 81 per cent of the internally \r\ndisplaced persons have left makeshift sites to return \r\nto their communities. Despite the improvements, the \r\nhumanitarian situation remains worrying in general, \r\nsince it is dependent on the fragile security situation, \r\nparticularly in the countryside.\r\nEfforts should be focused on the return of 400,000 \r\nrefugees now in neighbouring countries. Similarly, the \r\nresources mobilized so far cover only 48 per cent of \r\nthe expressed humanitarian need. In that respect, we \r\nexpect other disbursements to support the return of \r\ndisplaced and exiled persons to their homes.\r\nWith regard to the economy, the Central African \r\nRepublic’s economy has been hit hard by the deep \r\ncrisis. As a result, the growth rate of the country fell \r\n14-55126 11/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nto minus 36 per cent in 2013, placing the country in \r\nsudden deep recession. Thanks to active diplomacy, the \r\nCentral African Republic has benefited from emergency \r\nbudgetary support for CEMAC and ECCAS countries, \r\nan agreement signed with the International Monetary \r\nFund for the conclusion of a programme for the rapid \r\ndisbursement of credits and budgetary support from \r\nthe World Bank, the African Development Bank and \r\nthe European Union, as well as agreements signed with \r\nFrance for budget support. Beyond the announcements \r\nthat have been made, the effective disbursement \r\nof those funds will boost our country’s economic \r\nactivities and set it on a path of growth. The emergency \r\nplan for sustainable reconstruction was designed to \r\neffectively respond to the economic crisis, and one of \r\nour expectations vis-à-vis the international community \r\nis that we should be given all the necessary support for \r\nthe effective implementation of that plan.\r\nIn order to promote political dialogue and national \r\nreconciliation and help Central Africans to live better \r\nwith one another, I have always focused on pacifying \r\nhearts and minds so as to achieve genuine national \r\nreconciliation. The first step was taken in Brazzaville \r\non 23 July. It is now time to continue the process in \r\nthe Central African Republic itself, by providing our \r\npeople with an opportunity to assess the situation of the \r\ncountry themselves and share their vision for the future \r\nof the country, and by bringing together all the parties \r\nto the crisis around a table to consider a new republican \r\npact to recast the Central African State. The Central \r\nAfrican Republic cherishes the ardent wish that special \r\nattention will be given to the political process, whose \r\nsuccess will depend on the resources available for its \r\nimplementation.\r\nI would like to commend the relevance of the \r\ntheme that was chosen for this session of the General \r\nAssembly. That theme should lead us to take stock \r\nof the achievements of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and of emerging challenges. It comes at the right \r\ntime, because our world continues to be shaken by \r\ncrises of all types in Africa, the Middle and Near East, \r\nAsia, Eastern Europe and Latin America. The Ebola \r\nvirus disease, which is raging throughout the West \r\nAfrican region with the risk of expanding beyond the \r\nregion, is another current challenge that has large-scale, \r\nadverse economic and humanitarian consequences in \r\nmany countries. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto extend, from this high rostrum, my most heartfelt \r\ncondolences and those of the people of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic to our brotherly countries in Africa \r\naffected by that scourge, which has claimed so many \r\nlives.\r\nI also extend my condolences and those of the \r\nCentral African people to French President François \r\nHollande and the French people for the dastardly \r\nmurder of Hervé Gourdel, which has upset us all. That \r\ncowardly murder is a timely reminder of the need to \r\nstep up our fight against terrorism, which remains a \r\nmajor threat to our planet and a real obstacle to the \r\npromotion of international peace and security. The \r\nCentral African Republic calls for greater mobilization \r\nby the international community against terrorism, and \r\nin particular against the Boko Haram sect operating \r\nin Nigeria and Cameroon, not far from the borders of \r\nmy country and against the Lord’s Resistance Army, \r\nwhich continues to rage throughout the territory of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and some \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nSimilarly, the Central African Republic opposes the \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, which \r\ncontinue to be traded illicitly and continue to fuel the \r\nworst conflicts throughout the world, particularly in \r\nAfrica. The Central African Republic welcomes the \r\nefforts undertaken to achieve the signing of the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty and the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2117 (2013) on the non-proliferation of \r\nsmall arms and light weapons, and we are awaiting the \r\neffective implementation of that resolution.\r\nRelated to situations of war is the issue of justice \r\nand human rights. I am strongly committed to fighting \r\nimpunity. The Central African Republic, as a party to \r\nthe Rome Statute, will continue to support the actions \r\nof the International Criminal Court in its fight against \r\nimpunity for the most serious crimes, which affect the \r\nentire international community, and especially my \r\ncountry. In that context, the Central African Republic \r\nsupports the initiative taken by France and Mexico \r\nto cut back on the abusive use of the right of veto in \r\nthe Security Council in cases involving massacres of \r\ncivilian populations, war crimes and genocide.\r\nMy country had been committed to achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, and to that end has \r\ndeveloped a poverty-reduction strategy paper that has \r\nbeen implemented with tangible results, including in \r\nthe areas of water, sanitation and education. That was \r\nthe case until the most recent crisis unfortunately came \r\nabout, which called everything into question. I should \r\nalso like to draw the attention of the international \r\ncommunity to landlocked States like mine and to call \r\n12/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nfor international solidarity to ensure that substantial \r\nassistance be granted to them in order to ease the \r\nburden associated with our economic vulnerability and \r\nfacilitate the implementation of the Almaty Programme \r\nof Action.\r\nI commend the efforts undertaken by the \r\ninternational community to stem climate change and its \r\nnegative impact on the world. I strongly encourage all \r\ncountries to ratify the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol and to incorporate the principles of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\ninto the new agreement to be adopted at Paris in 2015.\r\nThe Central African Republic is against any and \r\nall attempts in favour of partition and threats against \r\nthe territorial integrity of nations. As such, it supports \r\nthe position of the Kingdom of Morocco on the Sahara \r\nissue, which is in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions 1754 (2007) and 2152 (2014).\r\nI cannot conclude without paying a heartfelt tribute \r\nto the work of the United Nations to promote peace \r\nthroughout the world. In conclusion, I would like to \r\nexpress, above all, my pride at the courage and great \r\nresilience of the Central African people and their \r\ndetermination to rise up from the recurrent crises that \r\nhave inflicted untold suffering on them. Long live the \r\nUnited Nations! Long live international solidarity to \r\nensure that peace and security prevails throughout the \r\nworld!\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Transitional \r\nGovernment of the Central African Republic for the \r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMs. Catherine Samba-Panza, President of the \r\nTransitional Government of the Central African \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Prosper Bazombanza, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi.\r\nMr. Prosper Bazombanza, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Prosper Bazombanza, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Burundi, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Bazombanza (Burundi) (spoke in French): \r\nOn behalf of His Excellency Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, \r\nPresident of Burundi, and the people of Burundi as a \r\nwhole, I would first like to offer warm congratulations \r\nto you, Sam Kutesa, a son of Africa, for your election \r\nby acclamation on 11 June as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its current session. I would also like to \r\nacknowledge the remarkable work of His Excellency \r\nMr. John Ashe, who presided over the Assembly at \r\nits sixty-eighth session, which he closed in this newly \r\nrenovated Hall. And I take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his untiring efforts to improve the functioning \r\nof the Organization and for the results attained in a \r\nparticularly difficult socioeconomic context.\r\nAt this important moment, when delegations from \r\nmany different parts of the globe have come together, \r\nwe would like to express our appreciation for the \r\ntheme of the sixty-ninth session, “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”. It comes at just the right time, since we are \r\nslowly but surely and inexorably approaching the \r\ndeadline for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs).\r\nBeyond that, I would also like to welcome the \r\npriorities that you have already set, Mr. President, \r\nwhich focus on eradicating poverty and hunger and \r\npromoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth. \r\nAs the authors of the report of the high-level group \r\nestablished to make recommendations on the post-\r\n2015 development programme put it, the theme chosen \r\nand your priorities are simultaneously ambitious and \r\npragmatic. The report cites intense discussions in every \r\nregion and in many sectors, especially on those living \r\nin poverty. The same team fosters the hope that our \r\ngeneration will be able to produce the transformations \r\nneeded to end the poverty that is devastating people all \r\nover our planet.\r\nWe should therefore emphasize that however \r\nambitious the group’s recommendations may be, they \r\nshould also take into account the realities on the ground \r\nand the fact that the transformative changes linked to \r\nthe goals and indicative targets — those coming out \r\nof discussions with 5,000 civil society organizations, \r\n250 leaders of major businesses and the scientific and \r\n14-55126 13/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nacademic communities, along with national, regional \r\nand international consultations — can contribute \r\nto reducing hunger and poverty around the world by \r\ngenerating tangible economic growth that can be \r\nequitably shared in order to achieve the well-being we \r\nseek.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals were a pact of \r\nglobal socioeconomic solidarity for our countries. Like \r\nother nations in Africa and elsewhere, Burundi has \r\ngreat respect for those Goals. As the aforementioned \r\ngroup has rightly pointed out, the fastest reduction in \r\npoverty in the history of the world occurred during the \r\nfirst 13 years of the new millennium. The same group \r\nnotes that the number of people living on $1.25 a day \r\nhas fallen, and child mortality has declined by 30 per \r\ncent since the 2000 Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2), while deaths attributable to malaria have been \r\nreduced by one quarter.\r\nWhile we should note that not every country can \r\nboast the same progress, Burundi shares the belief that \r\nit would be wrong for us to abandon the MDGs and start \r\nover at zero. On the contrary, we should continue the \r\nreforms that have produced the unprecedented progress, \r\nwhich is unquestionably the result of improved policies \r\nand commitment on a global scale aimed at meeting the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We should therefore \r\ncapitalize on them in order to profit further. We also \r\nsubscribe to the other declared priorities, including \r\nthe adoption of a post-2015 development agenda, the \r\nstrengthening of cooperation and reforming the United \r\nNations, as well as strengthening partnerships between \r\nthe United Nations and other bodies.\r\nAlthough at the moment it seems clear that Burundi \r\nwill not be able to fully meet the established Goals, I \r\nshould point out that we have made undeniable progress \r\nin the areas of education and health, thanks in particular \r\nto our programmes of free education and medical care \r\nfor children under five and new mothers. Besides the \r\n3,000 classrooms and many health centres built over the \r\npast few years, we have seen positive results in other \r\nsectors, too.\r\nIn the area of education, many young Burundians, \r\nincluding girls, who had no access to schooling in the \r\npast are now attending school. In the area of health care, \r\nwe have reduced child and maternal mortality, and we \r\nare working on stabilizing the prevalence of HIV/AIDS \r\nand meeting the eligibility requirements for the Global \r\nFund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. We \r\ndelivered accounts of those efforts at the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-eighth session, as well as of the reduction of \r\ndeaths due to malaria.\r\nOn the political front, as we indicated in our address \r\nto the Assembly at the sixty-eighth session, Burundi has \r\nbeen working on the process we committed to months \r\nago for holding presidential and general elections, \r\nscheduled to begin in May 2015. In that regard, it is \r\nimportant to note that after the holding of successive \r\nelections in 2005 and 2010, with support from the \r\nUnited Nations and other partners, the entire political \r\nclass, through the leaders of the authorized political \r\nparties and other parties, agreed in March 2013 on a \r\nroad map for the next elections.\r\nIn that regard, one must add that, thanks to \r\nthat extremely valuable instrument, which should \r\nhelp the Burundian political parties in the holding \r\nof transparent, free and democratic elections, the \r\nBurundian Parliament adopted the electoral code by \r\nconsensus. Subsequently, the Head of State promulgated \r\nit, as prescribed by our Constitution, which is the fruit \r\nof the Arusha Agreement of 2000, to which Burundi \r\nattaches great importance. Moreover, the electoral \r\ncalendar was announced last June by the Independent \r\nNational Electoral Commission, itself established after \r\nconsultations and agreement among the political parties \r\ninvolved in the matter.\r\nWe can therefore say that things are moving \r\nand progressing well in my country. I also wish to \r\nreaffirm loud and clear what the Head of State, His \r\nExcellency Pierre Nkurunziza, often reiterates, that \r\nthe 2015 elections will be held in better conditions than \r\nprevious elections and that success will be complete. \r\nThe Burundian people have suffered so much from the \r\nviolence that has plunged many families into mourning \r\nthat we cannot afford to relapse into the errors of the \r\npast. Indeed, we made the firm commitment to bury \r\nthe hatchet once and for all. That is why we have made \r\nour own the words of former Indian politician Mahatma \r\nGandhi: “I object to violence because when it appears \r\nto do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does \r\nis permanent”.\r\nWith regard to good governance, my delegation \r\nwould like to return to the institutions established \r\nduring the current legislature session. The tools for \r\nimproving good governance include the National \r\nIndependent Human Rights Commmission and the \r\ninstitution of the Ombudsman, whose performance is \r\ndeemed satisfactory by many of our compatriots. A \r\nnational strategy on good governance and on the fight \r\n14/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nagainst poverty for 2011-2015 has been adopted and is \r\nbeing implemented.\r\nOf course, we are far from achieving the expected \r\nresults, but in Burundi and elsewhere it is a long-\r\nterm undertaking. What is important is that there \r\nis the political will to always move forward and \r\nmeet the challenge of zero tolerance in this area \r\neventually. In addition, performance contracts have \r\nbeen signed by members of the Government and by the \r\nsenior Government officials in order to improve the \r\nfunctioning of our Administration. The establishment \r\nof the Burundi Revenue Authority has improved State \r\nrevenues and reduced corruption, which was also once a \r\ncommon practice in our tax administration and business \r\ncircles. Here too, one must point out that perfection is \r\nnot yet at hand, but there is the determination and the \r\nwill to resolve the scourge of corruption for good.\r\nAs for the Truth and Reconсiliation Commission \r\nenvisaged by the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation \r\nAccord, the relevant law has already been passed by \r\nParliament. Consultations are under way to elect its \r\n11 commissioners, on the understanding that the filing \r\nof nominations was closed in July 2014, and an ad hoc \r\ncommittee for the selection of candidates has just been \r\nset up by general consensus.\r\nConcerning the participation of women in political \r\nlife, we have strengthened the number of women in \r\nthe country’s institutions, even going beyond the \r\nconstitutional provisions in that area. The Burundian \r\ndelegation provided the figures in its statement last \r\nyear.\r\nWith respect to the peacebuilding programme in \r\nBurundi, the coordination mechanisms, such as the \r\ncoordination group of partners, hold their meetings \r\nthrough appropriate structures, such as clusters, \r\nstrategic forums and policy forums. The same is true \r\nfor the coordination of assistance, for which Burundi \r\nadopted the same structures.\r\nThe mandate of the United Nations Office in \r\nBurundi will end on 31 December, and the Office will \r\ntransfer its responsibilities to a United Nations country \r\nteam in Burundi, preparations for which are in full \r\nswing. A joint transition programme was presented to \r\nthe appropriate body on 14 May in the United Nations \r\nOffice. Also, a joint steering committee and a technical \r\ntransition team were established and are functioning \r\naccording to their mandate.\r\nFinally, also in the context of peace consolidation, \r\na third phase of that programme, coverning the period \r\n2014 to 2016, will soon become operational. The themes \r\nof the programme have already been adopted by the \r\nrelevant authorities.\r\nOn the economic front, Burundi has held two \r\nsectoral conferences on priority areas, one in July \r\n2013 and the other in October. Their purpose was to \r\ndecide, together with bilateral partners, on ways and \r\nmeans to implement the commitments made by each \r\nat the conference of Burundi’s development partners \r\nheld in Geneva in October 2012. The areas deemed \r\npriorities were drawn from two strategic instruments: \r\nthe Burundi Vision 2025 and the Strategic Framework \r\nfor Growth and the Fight against Corruption, Second \r\nGeneration.\r\nThe first instrument is for long-term development \r\nplanning and projects Burundi’s image in 2025. It \r\nshould guide policies and strategies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment from the perspective of meeting the \r\nneeds of present generations without hampering \r\nor compromising future generations. The second \r\ninstrument — the Strategic Framework for Growth \r\nand the Fight against Poverty, Second Generation — is \r\nanchored in Vision 2025. It is the unifying framework \r\nfor all sectoral and multisectoral policies, breaking the \r\nstrategic pillars of the Vision Burundi 2025 down into \r\nprojects and programmes.\r\nThe results obtained in the economic sphere are \r\nrather mixed. That is why the Government would \r\nagain like to make an urgent appeal from this rostrum \r\nto the partners represented here that they honour the \r\ncommitments made at the Geneva conference of 2012.\r\nRegarding Burundi’s post-2015 development \r\nprogramme, the following areas have been identified. \r\nThey are: governance, inequalities, conflicts and \r\nfragility; economic growth and employment; energy, \r\nwater and environmental sustainability; access to basic \r\nsocial services; and population dynamics and food \r\nsecurity. That agenda was the result of an extensive \r\nnational consultation that included all segments of the \r\npopulation. On its face, it can be seen to be a programme \r\nrooted in the continuity of change, well grounded in the \r\ntransformative development of the lives of our people \r\nand consistent with the theme for this session of the \r\nAssembly.\r\nEven if regional integration does not seem to be \r\nexplicitly laid out in the programme, I would like to \r\n14-55126 15/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nconvey to all present that regional integration is a matter \r\nto which Burundi is firmly committed and which it \r\nconsiders to be a common thread linking the various \r\npolicy areas, with the potential to provide appropriate \r\nresponses to the challenges that our country faces.\r\nAt the international level, conflicts continue to \r\ntear a number of countries apart and to undermine \r\ndevelopment efforts in many others. We must mobilize \r\nour energies and work in synergy to end and eliminate \r\nsuch threats as terrorism, transnational organized \r\ncrime, drug trafficking, human trafficking and others. \r\nIn that regard, Burundi is striving, as much as possible, \r\nto do its part to help maintain peace and security in the \r\nworld.\r\nBurundi was one of two countries in Africa and \r\nthe world that decided to intervene in Somalia as part \r\nof the African Union Mission in 2008, and we continue \r\nto strive to contribute to the stabilization of that \r\ncountry to this day. In that regard, Burundi is proud \r\nof the progress made towards normalization in Somali, \r\nwhich promises a better future for Somalia. However, \r\nthe success achieved should not obscure the enormous \r\nchallenges still facing Somalia. Burundi is committed \r\nto working with the other partners to address them.\r\nBurundi has also participated in peacekeeping \r\noperations in other countries, including the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Haiti, the Sudan and \r\nSyria, to name but a few.\r\nWith regard to Mali, we are greatly satisfied that \r\nterritorial integrity has been restored in that country \r\nand that the presidential elections held there were a \r\nsuccess.\r\nRegarding the conflict in the Middle East, Burundi, \r\nlike other members of the international community, \r\nis deeply concerned about the deteriorating security \r\nsituation in the region observed in recent weeks. That is \r\nwhy we urge all parties to stop armed attacks, to avoid \r\nthe loss of human life and to seek negotiated settlements \r\nto their disputes.\r\nFinally, with regard to the Ebola crisis, we, like \r\nother African countries, are very concerned about \r\nthe rapid spread of the Ebola virus, as was vividly \r\ndescribed by many representatives during the Security \r\nCouncil meeting of 18 September (see S/PV.7268). \r\nWe congratulate the Council on its adoption on \r\n18 September of resolution 2177 (2014) on the Ebola \r\ncrisis, at the initiative of the United States of America. \r\nMy delegation is proud to have sponsored the resolution, \r\nalong with 134 other States, early in its development.\r\nWith regard to South Sudan, we urgently call on \r\nall parties to the conflict to break the cycle of violence \r\nand resolve their differences through political dialogue. \r\nIn that connection, we are pleased to announce that \r\nBurundi has promised an infantry battalion of 850 men \r\nto help that young State to restore peace and security.\r\nI also wish to inform the Assembly that Burundi \r\nhas made progress regarding the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in \r\ngeneral and in the areas of education and health in \r\nparticular. However, despite my country’s efforts to \r\naccelerate actions to honour the commitments made \r\nat the Millennium Summit in 2000, the international \r\neconomic climate, and that in Burundi in particular, \r\nhas not been favourable for their attainment. The \r\nGovernment of Burundi remains committed, however, \r\nto the development goals programme and will continue \r\nto work beyond 2015 to redouble its efforts to safeguard \r\nand strengthen the principles and values contained in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), which \r\nis a solid foundation for the post-2015 development \r\nprogramme.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nBurundi for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Prosper Bazombanza, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of India\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Republic of India.\r\nMr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof India, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of India, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Modi (India) (spoke in Hindi; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I would like \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\n16/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nIt is a truly a great honour for me to address the \r\nAssembly for the first time as Prime Minister of India. \r\nI am humbled by the hopes and expectations of the \r\npeople of India. I am also mindful of the expectations \r\nof the world from our 1.25 billion people.\r\nMy country, India, is home to one sixth of \r\nthe world’s population. It is a nation experiencing \r\neconomic and social transformation on a scale rarely \r\nseen in the history of the world. Every country’s world \r\nview is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical \r\ntraditions. India’s ancient wisdom sees the world as one \r\nfamily, and when I say this, I wish to make it clear that \r\neach country has its philosophy. I am not talking about \r\nideology. With the inspiration of that philosophy, a \r\ncountry marches ahead. India is a country that since its \r\nVedic times, has been saying that the world, the entire \r\nglobe, is a family. India is a country where, beyond \r\nnature, we have a communication, a dialogue, with \r\nnature. We never struggle with nature. That is a part \r\nof Indian life. The reason is that with that philosophy, \r\nIndia has been moving forward. Each country and each \r\nnation is shaped by its civilization and its philosophical \r\ntradition. India’s ancient wisdom, as I have said, sees \r\nthe world as one family. India is a country that not only \r\nspeaks for itself but for worldwide justice, dignity, \r\nopportunity and prosperity. We have always spoken out \r\nin support of such issues.\r\nOwing to our ideology, we have a firm belief in \r\nmultilateralism. Today, as I stand here, I am equally \r\naware of the hopes and expectations that are pinned on \r\nthe General Assembly. I am struck by the sacred belief \r\nthat brought us together. We established the Organization \r\non the basis of great principles and perspectives, in the \r\nbelief that if our futures are connected, we will have to \r\nwork together for peace and security, for human rights \r\nand for the economic development of all. We must work \r\ntogether to those ends. At that time, there were only \r\n51 countries. Today, 193 sovereign f lags f ly in front of \r\nthis building. Each new country enters on the basis of \r\nthe same belief and expectation.\r\nIn the past six decades, we have been able to achieve \r\na great deal. We have ended many wars. We have \r\nestablished and maintained peace. We have assisted \r\neconomic development in many places. We have helped \r\nto build a future for poor children. We have contributed \r\ntowards the elimination of starvation and strived to \r\nsave our planet. The 69 United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions have made the Blue Helmet a symbol of peace \r\nin the world.\r\nToday, there is a surge of democracy across the \r\nworld. The peaceful democratic transformation in \r\nAfghanistan shows that the Afghan people’s aspiration \r\nfor peace will definitely triumph over violence. We \r\nhave seen Nepal emerge from war towards peace and \r\ndemocracy. Bhutan’s young democracy is f lourishing. \r\nThere are also efforts towards democracy in West Asia \r\nand North Africa. Tunisia’s success shows that such a \r\npath of democracy is possible. In Africa, there is a new \r\nmomentum for stability, peace and progress, and a new \r\nawareness is on the horizon.\r\nWe have seen unprecedented prosperity in Asia and \r\nbeyond founded on strengthened peace and stability. \r\nLatin America, a continent of enormous potential, is \r\ncoming together in the shared pursuit of stability and \r\nprosperity. That continent may prove to be an important \r\nanchor for the global community. India looks forward to \r\na peaceful and stable environment for its development. \r\nOur future is linked to our neighbourhood. That is why, \r\nfrom the very first day, my Government gave the highest \r\npriority to promoting friendship and cooperation with \r\nour neighbouring countries.\r\nI have the same policy towards Pakistan. I want \r\nto hold serious bilateral talks with Pakistan in order \r\nto improve friendship and cooperation in a peaceful \r\natmosphere, without the shadow of terrorism. I want \r\nto hold bilateral talks with that country. However, it \r\nis also Pakistan’s responsibility to come forward and \r\nto genuinely establish the appropriate atmosphere for \r\nbilateral talks. In raising that issue in this forum, I do \r\nnot know how successful our efforts will be. Some \r\npeople are doubtful.\r\nToday, we need to assist the victims of the f loods \r\nin Kashmir. In India, we have organized large-scale \r\nassistance. We have not stopped at only India helping \r\nKashmir. We have also asked Pakistan to assist, since \r\nthat area was also affected by the f loods. We have told \r\nPakistan that just as we were helping the f lood victims \r\nin India, we would also like to help those in Pakistan. \r\nWe have proposed that. We are a part of the developing \r\nworld but have limited resources. We would like to \r\nshare our modest resources with all those who are in \r\ndire need of assistance.\r\nToday, the world is witnessing a high level of \r\ntension and turmoil. There are no major wars, but \r\ntension and conflict abound. There is an absence of \r\npeace and uncertainty about the future. Even today, \r\nthere is rampant poverty everywhere. The Asia-Pacific \r\n14-55126 17/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nregion, which is integrating, is still concerned about \r\nmaritime security. That is fundamental to its future. \r\nEurope faces a new threat of division. In West Asia, \r\nthe dividing lines and terrorism are increasing. In our \r\nown region, we are still struggling to combat terrorism \r\nand instability. For the past four decades, we have faced \r\nsuch a threat.\r\nTerrorism emerges in new forms and under new \r\nnames. Be it small or large, in the North, the South, \r\nthe East or the West, no country is free from threats. \r\nI remember when I met with world leaders 20 years \r\nago, and we talked about terrorism. They did not quite \r\nunderstand it and stated that it was a law-and-order \r\nproblem. Today, the entire world is witness to the slow \r\nspread of terrorism far and wide.\r\nAre we really making integrated efforts at the \r\ninternational level to fight against those powerful \r\ngroups? I know that terrorism is a very serious problem \r\nfor discussion. Even today, some countries are giving \r\nrefuge to international terrorists, and they consider \r\nterrorism a tool of their policy. Good terrorism and bad \r\nterrorism — that is what we hear these days. At this \r\ntime, there is a question mark regarding our struggle to \r\nfight against terrorism. The brutal return of terrorism \r\nin West Asia and its impact on countries far and near \r\nhas elicited a concerted effort, which we welcome. \r\nHowever, the effort should involve all the countries of \r\nthe region. If we want to overcome terrorism, then they \r\nmust all contribute towards its eradication. We strongly \r\nemphasize this.\r\nOceans, seas, space and cyberspace, besides \r\ncontributing to our common wealth and prosperity, are \r\nbecoming new theatres of conflict. In the same oceans \r\nthat used to connect us, we are today hearing news of \r\ndisputes. We once saw space as holding out potential \r\nfor our achievements. Today, in cyberspace, which \r\nconnects us in important areas, new dangers are being \r\nseen. International harmony and cooperation — on \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded — are needed \r\nnow more than ever before. Today, we talk about an \r\ninterdependent world, but have we become more united \r\nas nations? We need to think about that.\r\nWhy, when we have a good forum like the United \r\nNations, do we keep creating so many different groups? \r\nThere is the Group of Four, the Group of Seven and \r\nthe Group of 20 — and the numbers keep changing. \r\nWhether or not we really want to do so, we, including \r\nIndia, become members of them. Is it not the time to \r\nmove on and leave behind those groups? When the \r\nUnited Nations celebrates its seventieth anniversary, \r\nhow do we create a Group-of-All atmosphere? How can \r\nthe General Assembly create an opportunity to solve \r\nall our problems? How can people begin to be more \r\ntrustful? How can we become less competitive? We talk \r\nabout unity, but then we divide the whole into different \r\nparts and pieces. Can we prevent ourselves from doing \r\nso?\r\nOn the one hand, we say that our policies are \r\ninterconnected; on the other, we think in terms of \r\nzero-sum gains. We think that if the other benefits, I \r\nstand to lose. Who receives the benefit and who suffers \r\nthe loss? That is what we appear to be weighing. The \r\npessimists are cynical. Like them, we are inclined to \r\nsay nothing will change. It is easy to be cynical and \r\nto say nothing will change. But if we do that, we run \r\nthe risk of shirking our responsibilities and putting our \r\ncollective future in danger.\r\nWe must unite and prepare to meet the needs of our \r\ntimes. We must really work for global peace. No one \r\ncountry or group of countries can determine the course \r\nof the world or its policies. It is imperative to have \r\ngenuine international participation and partnership. We \r\nshould try to promote positive dialogue and cooperation \r\namong countries. Our efforts must begin at the United \r\nNations.\r\nIt is important that we improve the Security Council \r\nby making it more democratic and participative. \r\nInstitutions that reflect the imperatives of the twentieth \r\ncentury will not be effective in the twenty-first century. \r\nThey face the risk of irrelevance. I would like to \r\nemphasize that the policies and rules we made in the \r\ntwentieth century may no longer be applicable. The \r\nspeed of change is very fast. It is therefore essential \r\nthat, in tune with the times, we adapt and reformulate, \r\nmaking the necessary changes and introducing new \r\nideas. Only when we have done that will we be relevant.\r\nWe should set aside all our differences and mount \r\na concerted international effort to combat terrorism \r\nand extremism. Towards that end, we should adopt a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism. \r\nThat is something which is long overdue. It must be \r\nemphasized that our combined strength to fight against \r\nterrorism should be reflected in the convention. Our \r\ncountry, which has endured so many terrorist attacks, \r\nknows that, so long as the United Nations fails to take \r\nthe initiative in that effort, and so long as we do not \r\nadopt a convention, we cannot be successful. In such \r\nwork, we must not forget to make provision for peace, \r\n18/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nstability and order in outer space and cyberspace. We \r\nmust work together to ensure that all countries observe \r\ninternational rules and norms.\r\nWe must include the host countries and troop-\r\ncontributing countries in our decision-making on \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. If they are included, their \r\nconfidence will increase considerably. They are ready \r\nto make major sacrifices and to give their time and \r\nenergy. But if they are excluded from decision-making, \r\nthen how can United Nations peacekeeping become \r\nmore vital and urgent? We need to seriously consider \r\nthat. Today, let us redouble our efforts in pursuit of \r\nglobal disarmament. Let us also spare no effort to \r\nensure that we work tirelessly towards those goals.\r\nGlobalization has created new industries and \r\nsources of employment. At the same time, billions live \r\nin the shadow of poverty. A great many countries are \r\nsuffering economic deprivation, barely keeping their \r\nheads above water. What seems so difficult today was \r\nnever so difficult in the past. Technology has made many \r\nthings possible. Reduction in the cost of technology has \r\nmade it more widely available. If we think of the speed \r\nwith which Facebook or Twitter have spread around the \r\nworld and cell-phone use has proliferated, then we must \r\nalso believe that development and empowerment can \r\nspread with the same speed.\r\nIt is up to each country to make its own efforts \r\nat the national level. Each Government must fulfil its \r\nresponsibilities. International participation is also very \r\nimportant. At one level, it requires better coordination \r\nof policy, so that our efforts become mutually \r\nsupportive, not mutually damaging. It also means that, \r\nwhen we craft agreements on international trade, we \r\naccommodate one another’s concerns and interests.\r\nLet us think about the scale of the need. Today, \r\nbasic sanitation is out of the reach of 2.5 billion people; \r\n1.3 billion have no access to electricity and 1.1 billion \r\nno access to drinking water. That makes it clear that \r\nmore comprehensive and concerted international action \r\nis required. We cannot keep waiting for economic \r\ndevelopment. In India, the most important aspects of \r\nmy development agenda are focused precisely on those \r\nvery issues, which should also be at the core of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, as they deserve our utmost \r\nattention.\r\nA world that is more habitable and sustainable is an \r\nobjective we must work towards. There has been much \r\ndebate and much written about that, but it takes only a \r\nbrief glance around our countries to become concerned. \r\nWe are very concerned indeed about issues relating to \r\nforests, wildlife, birds, rivers, water sources and the \r\nblue sky above.\r\nI would like to address three points. First, if we \r\nare to meet all of the challenges, we must fully uphold \r\nour responsibilities. The global community has \r\nagreed to work together on the basis of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibility. That must continue to be \r\nthe foundation of future action. That also means that \r\ndeveloped countries must fulfil their commitments in \r\nterms of funding and technology transfer.\r\nSecondly, national action is imperative. Technology \r\nhas made many things possible, such as renewable \r\nenergy. We need imagination and commitment. India \r\nstands ready to share its technology and capabilities, as \r\nfor example through the recently announced free access \r\nto a satellite.\r\nThirdly, we need to change our lifestyles. Avoiding \r\nenergy use is the cleanest option and would give a \r\nnew direction to our economy. For us in India, respect \r\nfor nature is fundamental and an integral part of \r\nspiritualism. It is part of our ideology.\r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nanother idea. When we talk of climate change, we are \r\nalso talking about holistic health care, connecting with \r\nnature and going back to basics. Today, I would like \r\nto underscore that yoga is an invaluable gift from our \r\nancient tradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and \r\nbody, thought and action. It is important to coordinate \r\nall of those aspects. Such a holistic approach is valuable \r\nto our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just about \r\nexercise; it is a way to discover the sense of oneness \r\nwith yourself, the world and nature. By changing our \r\nlifestyle and creating consciousness, it can also help us \r\ndeal with climate change. Let us work towards adopting \r\nan international yoga day.\r\nFinally, we are at a historic moment. Every age is \r\ndefined by its character and remembered for how it \r\nrose to meet its challenges. Today, we are responsible \r\nto rise and meet those challenges. Next year, the United \r\nNations will be 70 years old. We should ask ourselves \r\nwhether we should wait until we are 80 or 100 years \r\nold to take action. I believe that next year will provide \r\nan opportunity for the United Nations. After a voyage \r\nspanning 70 years, we shall be able to look back and \r\nreview what we have achieved, whence we began, \r\nwhy we left certain places, what motivated us, how \r\n14-55126 19/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nwe proceeded and what we have attained. What are \r\nthe challenges facing us in the twenty-first century? If \r\nwe can keep all of that in mind, through exchanges of \r\nviews, dialogue with universities, and intergenerational \r\ndiscussions with young people, who can contribute \r\nideas, then we will find the ways to connect all of those \r\nthings for future generations.\r\nThat is why I say that arriving at the milestone \r\nof 70 years presents us with a great opportunity that \r\nwe should not waste. By taking full advantage of this \r\nmoment, we could achieve a new consciousness, a new \r\nlife, with new ambitions and aspirations. We could \r\ngive the journey of the United Nations a new form. I \r\ntherefore feel that 70 years is a great opportunity for \r\nus. Let us come together and fulfil our promise to bring \r\nimprovements to the Security Council. That issue has \r\nbeen before us for a long time, yet there has not been \r\nmuch progress. We need to think very seriously about \r\nit.\r\nMrs. Al-Mughairy (Oman), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn preparing and implementing the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, let us come together to keep our \r\npromises. For 2015, let us come together to give a new \r\ndirection and make the moment memorable by giving \r\nthe world a new lease on development. The year 2015 \r\nshould be a banner year in history — a turning point \r\nin history. I hope that we will all live up to its promise.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of India for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof India, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of \r\nthe People’s Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina, Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, and \r\ninviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I warmly \r\ncongratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. I also congratulate Ambassador John Ashe \r\nfor his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession. My appreciation also goes to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his stewardship of our endeavours to \r\nrealize our common vision of a world of peace, dignity \r\nand well-being for all.\r\nFour decades ago, in his maiden speech before \r\nthe General Assembly, the Father of our nation of \r\nBangladesh, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman \r\n(see A/PV.2243), described his vision for a global \r\norder, saying that the Bengali nation is pledge-bound \r\nto establish a global order, one based on peaceful \r\ncoexistence, social justice and freedom from poverty, \r\nhunger, exploitation and aggression. That vision \r\ncontinues to guide Bangladesh’s national development \r\npolicies and our engagement in global affairs.\r\nWe gather at a time when the global development \r\ndiscourse finds itself at an important juncture. As the \r\nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) approaches its deadline, the global community \r\nis engaged in framing a transformative development \r\nagenda for 2016-2030. The theme for this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is therefore quite timely. Bangladesh \r\nbelieves that our deliberations will help us to arrive at a \r\nbalanced, pragmatic and ambitious agenda.\r\nWe cannot achieve sustainable development in the \r\nabsence of durable peace and security. The volatile \r\nglobal security situation continues to pose significant \r\nchallenges to international development. Bangladesh \r\nbelieves that a threat to peace anywhere is a threat to \r\nhumankind as a whole.\r\nIn keeping with our position of principle, we \r\ncontinue to express our full solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-\r\ndetermination. We condemn the systematic killing of \r\nhundreds of Palestinian civilians, including women and \r\nchildren, by Israel during the recent offensive in Gaza. \r\nWe seek a permanent solution to that long-standing \r\nconflict through the creation of an independent and \r\nviable State of Palestine based on the pre-1967 borders \r\nand with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.\r\nBangladesh strongly believes in the centrality \r\nand legitimacy of the United Nations as the custodian \r\nof global peace, security and development. Our \r\n20/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\ncommitment to international peace is manifest in our \r\nsupport for the f lagship resolution 68/125 on a culture of \r\npeace and non-violence. Our peace leadership is further \r\nreaffirmed through our support to the United Nations as \r\none of the top troop- and police-contributing countries \r\nin the Organization’s peacekeeping endeavours. We \r\nhave so far contributed 128,133 peacekeepers in 54 \r\npeace missions. Bangladesh proudly contributes the \r\nhighest number of women police to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping, commensurate with our credentials in \r\nthe empowerment of women.\r\nTerrorism and extremism remain major impediments \r\non the road to global peace and development. My \r\nGovernment maintains a zero-tolerance policy with \r\nrespect to all forms of terrorism, violent extremism, \r\nradicalization and faith-based politics. We remain firm \r\nin our resolve not to allow any terrorist individual or \r\nentity to use our territory against any State.\r\nThe anti-liberation forces remain active in \r\nattempting to destroy the progressive and secular \r\nfabric of our nation. They resort to religious militancy \r\nand violent extremism at every opportunity. Under \r\nthe direct patronage of the Bangladesh Nationalist \r\nParty-Jamaat-e-Islami Alliance Government from \r\n2001 to 2006, they coalesced to form terrorist groups \r\nthat carried out bomb and grenade attacks and killed \r\nsecular political leaders and activists. Those gruesome \r\nattacks cemented my resolve to create a strong legal and \r\nregulatory regime for countering terrorism, including \r\nthe adoption of the amended Anti-terrorism Act of 2013 \r\nand the Money Laundering Prevention Act of 2012.\r\nMy Government is also seeking to entrench \r\ndemocracy, secularism and women’s empowerment in \r\norder to defeat terrorism and extremism ideologically. \r\nWe have also significantly enhanced transparency and \r\naccountability in governance by strengthening our \r\nelection, anti-corruption, human rights and information \r\ncommissions. To uphold peace and the rule of law and \r\nend the culture of impunity, my Government remains \r\npledge-bound to bring to justice the perpetrators of \r\nwar crimes, crimes against humanity, rape and acts of \r\ngenocide committed during our 1971 war of liberation. \r\nThe highly transparent, impartial and independent \r\ninternational crimes tribunals in Bangladesh have \r\nalready completed the trials of a few key criminals \r\nwho carried out heinous crimes against humanity. We \r\nhope for the international community’s full support for \r\nour people’s desire for this long-awaited rendering of \r\njustice.\r\nOur Government has integrated the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) into our national \r\nfive-year plan and Vision 2021, a people-centric \r\nprogramme that aspires to transform Bangladesh into \r\na knowledge-based, technology-driven middle-income \r\ncountry by 2021. Bangladesh has already met or is on \r\ntrack to meet the first six MDGs. Poverty rates have \r\nfallen from 57 per cent in 1991 to below 25 per cent \r\ntoday. During the past five years, our gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP) growth rate remained at 6.2 per cent, \r\ndespite a global recession. Our export earnings grew \r\nmore than threefold from around $10.53 billion in \r\n2006 to more than $30.5 billion for the last fiscal year. \r\nRemittances have also almost tripled, from $5 billion \r\nin 2006 to $14.5 billion, while our foreign currency \r\nreserves jumped six and a half times, from $3.49 billion \r\nin 2006 to $22 billion today.\r\nIn an effort to unlock Bangladesh’s development \r\npotential, we have undertaken some massive \r\ninfrastructure and connectivity projects. We have begun \r\nwork on a 6.15-kilometre bridge over the great river \r\nPadma using our own resources. We will soon begin \r\ndeveloping a deep-sea port in Sonadia, Chittagong. We \r\nare already working on upgrading our road and rail \r\ninfrastructure, including expressways and river tunnels. \r\nWe have reached agreements with friendly countries \r\nsuch as India, China and Japan to develop large-scale \r\npower plants to meet our growing demands by 2021. We \r\nare developing 18 economic zones around the country \r\nto enable potential investors to invest in Bangladesh, \r\nespecially in the context of our growing integration \r\ninto the regional connectivity framework. Bangladesh \r\nenjoys a clear demographic dividend, with two thirds \r\nof its workforce young, employable and capable of \r\nremaining economically active till 2031. One of our \r\npolicy priorities is investing in skills development for \r\nour increasingly youthful population.\r\nWith a view to developing a knowledge-based \r\nsociety, we are rapidly building the capabilities of our \r\ncountry and people in the area of modern information \r\nand communications technologies. Our people currently \r\nreceive more than 200 types of service from more than \r\n4,500 union service and information centres, while rural \r\npopulations have access to health-care services from \r\nmore than 15,000 information-technology-connected \r\ncommunity health clinics and union health centres. \r\nThese networks enable us to bring various crucial \r\npublic services to our people’s homes at an affordable \r\ncost. Bangladesh has 117 million SIM cards with more \r\n14-55126 21/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nthan 78 per cent telephone penetration and 50 million \r\nInternet connections.\r\nBangladesh’s strides in education have enabled \r\nus to achieve the MDG targets of ensuring universal \r\nprimary school enrolment and gender parity in primary \r\nand secondary schools. Our Government provides \r\nstudents with a free education up to the twelfth grade \r\nand provides 12.8 million students, 75 per cent of them \r\ngirls, from poor families with monthly stipends from \r\nprimary level to graduation. Each year we distribute \r\naround 318 million free textbooks to all students up to \r\nthe secondary level. We are now focusing on improving \r\nthe quality of education to enable our boys and girls to \r\nacquire essential life skills and grow up with a truly \r\nglobal outlook.\r\nFor us, sustainable development implies the \r\nempowerment of women and their equal participation \r\nwith men in all walks of life. Our efforts to promote \r\nwomen’s empowerment by enhancing their access \r\nto productive resources and representation at the \r\nnational and local level are producing visible results. \r\nThe Government’s pragmatic policies have helped \r\nleadership by women grow from the grass-roots to the \r\nhighest levels. Bangladesh may be the only country \r\ntoday where women concurrently occupy the positions \r\nof Prime Minister, Speaker, leader of the opposition \r\nand deputy leader. In the judiciary, administration, the \r\ncivil service, the armed forces and law enforcement \r\nagencies, 10 per cent of posts are reserved for women, \r\nas are 60 per cent of primary-school teaching posts.\r\nWith a view to ensuring equality, my Government \r\nhas established numerous social safety-net programmes \r\nthat cover more than 24 per cent of the population, \r\nnotably feeding and development programmes for \r\nvulnerable groups; the Ashrayan poverty alleviation \r\nproject, which provides housing and income generation \r\nfor the homeless; monthly pensions for senior citizens, \r\nwidows, destitute women and the disabled; maternity \r\nallowances; and food and nutrition security for rural \r\ndwellers through one-house, one-farm schemes aimed \r\nat promoting family farming. Persons with disabilities \r\nare provided with education, skills development and \r\ninterest-free credit for self-employment, with a 1 per \r\ncent jobs quota reserved for them in the formal sector.\r\nThe MDGs have been the most successful global \r\nanti-poverty push in history. It is due to them that the \r\nworld is seeing 50 per cent less poverty than in 1990, \r\nas well as more girls in school, fewer children dying \r\nand more people with access to safe drinking water \r\nand sanitation. However, progress has been uneven and \r\nunequal within and among countries and regions. Sadly, \r\nmore than 1.3 billion people still live in abject poverty. \r\nAs we reflect on our new and emerging development \r\nchallenges, eradication of poverty must remain at the \r\ncentre of the post-2015 agenda, and we must build \r\nlinkages from it to all other goals. Our new framework \r\nmust achieve a balance between the three pillars of \r\nsustainable development, and it should particularly \r\nkeep in mind the importance of access and the unique \r\ncircumstances and diverse needs of countries such \r\nas Bangladesh. I am pleased that the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals has used a \r\nrigorous, broadly inclusive process to come up with \r\nrecommendations for a set of interlinked goals and \r\ntargets.\r\nIn Bangladesh, we have held national consultations \r\nand remained intensely engaged in the global process. \r\nWe consider the set of goals and targets a carefully \r\nbalanced package and a crucial basis for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. The future development agenda \r\nmust address low-income developing countries’ long-\r\nstanding constraints on resources and capacity in a \r\nmeaningful way and respond to emerging risks and \r\nvulnerabilities. The post-2015 development framework \r\nmust fulfil our aspirations for building an equitable, \r\nprosperous and sustainable world where no person \r\nor nation is left behind. It must also contribute to a \r\nstrengthened multilateralism, go beyond the national \r\npolicy space and forge international cooperation. \r\nGreater resources would be key to the success of the \r\npost-2015 agenda. There is a need for a robust and \r\nbroad-based global partnership based on the principles \r\nof mutual trust, respect and common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nBangladesh underscores its clear resolve with \r\nregard to the financing of sustainable development \r\nby next year, in particular from the financing for \r\ndevelopment process. While it is encouraging that some \r\ndeveloped countries have fulfilled their commitment to \r\ncontributing 0.7 per cent of their gross national income \r\n(GNI) and 0.2 per cent of GNI as official development \r\nassistance (ODA) to the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), most other countries have yet to fulfil those \r\ngoals. At the same time, in a globalized economy, the \r\nleast developed and most climate-vulnerable countries, \r\nsuch as Bangladesh, require greater support in terms of \r\nODA, science and technology innovation and capacity-\r\n22/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nbuilding. All products from all LDCs must be granted \r\nduty- and quota-free access to all markets of developed \r\ncountries.\r\nThe world today is witnessing unprecedented \r\nhuman mobility within and beyond borders. Bangladesh \r\nhas emerged as a key stakeholder in global migration. \r\nFor instance, remittances contribute approximately \r\n14 per cent of our GDP. Millions of our migrant \r\nworkers continue to make a significant contribution \r\nto development in a range of countries worldwide. We \r\nneed to acknowledge the manifold contributions that \r\nmigrants and their families make to our economies and \r\nsocieties apart from just remittances. It is therefore \r\nlogical for migration and development issues to find \r\na well-deserved space across the emerging post-\r\n2015 framework. It is my pleasure to announce that \r\nBangladesh will chair the ninth Global Forum on \r\nMigration and Development in 2016.\r\nNo challenge is as complex, widespread and \r\nformidable as climate change, in particular for \r\ncountries such as ours. A recent Asian Development \r\nBank report estimated that the mean economic cost of \r\nclimate change and adaptation for Bangladesh would \r\nbe between 2 and 9 per cent of GDP by 2100. Earlier, \r\nI emphasized before the Assembly that an increase of \r\n1°C in the temperature is estimated to lead to a 1-metre \r\nrise in the sea level, thereby submerging a fifth of the \r\nterritory of Bangladesh. That could compel 30 million \r\nof our people to move elsewhere as climate migrants. \r\nFor Bangladesh, climate change is a matter of bare \r\nsurvival.\r\nIn addressing climate change, adaptation remains \r\nparticularly key for us. We have a crucial need for \r\nadequate, predictable and additional climate financing, \r\naccess to locally adaptable technologies and support \r\nfor capacity- and institution-building. We reiterate, \r\nunder United Nations leadership, in particular through \r\nthe role of the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change (UNFCCC), the importance of the \r\nprocesses for the integration of the UNFCCC, disaster-\r\nrisk reduction and the sustainable development goals.\r\nThe world also needs to recognize the untapped \r\npotential of an ocean-based blue economy. The coastal \r\nand small island developing States stand to greatly \r\nbenefit from the balanced conservation, development \r\nand use of marine ecosystems, resources and services. \r\nWe call for global support for coastal countries, such as \r\nBangladesh, in developing the much-needed capacity, \r\ntechnology and institutional frameworks that will \r\nenable us to tap into blue opportunities. For that reason, \r\nwe continue to support the inclusion of blue-economy \r\nprinciples and practices in the post-2015 framework.\r\nBangladesh proposed a f lagship resolution at \r\nUNESCO, adopted in 1999, which led to the recognition \r\nof 21 February as the International Mother Language \r\nDay for the peoples of the world. We established the \r\nonly International Mother Language Institute in Dhaka \r\nto preserve the more than 6,500 mother tongues of \r\nhumankind. Those are two pillars of our commitment \r\nto mother languages. I once again call on the Assembly \r\nto recognize Bangla, which is spoken by more than \r\n300 million people, as an official language of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis year, Bangladesh celebrates 40 years of its \r\nmembership of the United Nations. On this special \r\noccasion, I should like to reaffirm, on behalf of \r\nour people, the appeal by the father of our nation, \r\nBangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, for our progeny \r\nat this Assembly in 1974: Let us together create a world \r\nthat can eradicate poverty, hunger, war and human \r\nsuffering and achieve global peace and security for the \r\nwell-being of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of Bangladesh for the statement she \r\nhas just made.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Fiji\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Fiji.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Bainimarama (Fiji): I join those who have \r\nspoken before me in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa on \r\nhis assumption of the office of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. Like them, I am \r\nconfident that, under his leadership, the sixty-ninth session \r\n14-55126 23/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nwill be productive. I would also like to express Fiji’s \r\ngratitude for the leadership of Mr. John Ashe throughout \r\nthe sixty-eighth session.\r\nFive years ago, I stood in this great Hall and promised \r\nthe global community that my Government would introduce \r\nthe first genuine democracy in Fiji’s history before the end \r\nof September (see A/64/PV.10). It is my honour to inform \r\nthe Assembly that, with the support of the Fijian people, \r\nI have kept that promise. I return to the Assembly today \r\nas the duly elected Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nFiji. At our general election on 17 September, I led my \r\nFiji First political movement to a decisive victory in \r\nthe first election to be held under our new Constitution \r\non the basis of equal votes of equal value. The new \r\nConstitution replaced the three previous constitutions \r\nsince our independence from Britain in 1970, in \r\nwhich Governments were chosen under a weighted \r\nand discriminatory formula that separated the various \r\ncommunities and favoured some citizens over others.\r\nFor nearly four decades, we laboured under a system \r\nthat was undemocratic, unjust and unfair. Indeed, we \r\nwere a case study of a nation that was supposedly \r\ndemocratic and casting itself as such, but was failing \r\nto meet some basic democratic standards — a common \r\nand equal citizenry, a common identity and a level \r\nplaying field on which every citizen can excel. We \r\nhave often heard it said that elections are key to having \r\ndemocracy. We in Fiji knew that that was not the case, \r\nbecause our electoral system, before it was reformed, \r\ndid not give us true democracy. It did not facilitate \r\njustice, transparency or good governance. It was about \r\nreinforcing power, the power of elites, and keeping the \r\npopulation divided into different communal groups. \r\nThat weighted system perpetuated injustice for a great \r\nmany of our people, created different classes of citizens \r\nand encouraged corruption. It was a system that no \r\nadvanced democracy would accept for itself. The status \r\nof any Fijian in national life depended on his or her \r\nracial origin, whether that man or woman came from \r\none of the chiefly or business elites, and even what part \r\nof the country the person lived in.\r\nWe needed a revolution to put us on the path to \r\ntrue democracy. And from the time that that revolution \r\nbegan in 2006 to our election 10 days ago, we embarked \r\non a series of reforms that have transformed our nation. \r\nMore laws were passed during this eight-year period to \r\nimprove our standard of governance than in the entire \r\n36-year period since independence. And central to that \r\nwas the development of our supreme law — the 2013 \r\nConstitution — from which all other laws f low. It is the \r\nblueprint for the new Fiji. Now every Fiji Islander enjoys \r\nequal opportunity and a common identity — Fijian. That \r\nname was once reserved for the indigenous majority but \r\nnow applies to everyone from the Republic of Fiji, just \r\nas the common name American applies to all from the \r\nUnited States or the name Australian to any Australian \r\nfrom Australia.\r\nA range of social and economic rights have also \r\nbeen enshrined in our supreme law for the first time, \r\nrights that comply with a number of United Nations \r\nconventions — the right to economic participation, \r\na just minimum wage, education, housing, health \r\nand adequate food and water. The right to live in an \r\nenvironment free of pollution is a principle we hope \r\nthat every nation will embrace, as we strive for the \r\npreservation and protection of our natural surroundings. \r\nSo today, I am proud to report to the Assembly that Fiji \r\nis a fairer, more just society and a more compassionate \r\nsociety, as we step up our efforts to alleviate poverty on \r\nthe back of a rapidly strengthening economy.\r\nWe have also set our sights on being a smarter \r\ncountry by introducing free schooling at the primary \r\nand secondary levels for the first time. Plus we now \r\nhave an array of scholarships and a tertiary loans \r\nscheme to enable our young people to go on to higher \r\neducation. Our vision is to cement our place as a \r\npre-eminent Pacific Island nation, a true regional hub \r\nand a Pacific beacon of prosperity and progress for our \r\nsmaller neighbours. We intend to play a bigger role in \r\nthe wider world to voice our collective concerns about \r\nsuch issues as the environment, climate change and the \r\nneed to create a fairer trading system to benefit our \r\npeople in the Pacific and in all developing countries.\r\nAs we begin this new era in our national life, I want \r\nto thank those in the greater community of nations \r\nwho have stood by us in recent years as we made the \r\nreforms that were necessary to create a better Fiji. Not \r\neveryone understood what we were trying to do. Some \r\ntried to damage us with sanctions and to degrade our \r\nquality of governance because we refused to accept \r\ntheir prescriptive and high-handed approach towards \r\nus. But the majority of nations recognized our right \r\nto determine our own future and came to understand \r\nthat we were working not for the benefit of a governing \r\nelite but for the common good. To those in the General \r\nAssembly who gave us their support, our friends, 1 \r\nextend the grateful thanks of the Fijian people.\r\n24/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nI also want to especially thank those countries \r\nthat made up the Multinational Observer Group that \r\ndeclared our general election credible, free and fair. \r\nFor the co-leaders from Australia, India, Indonesia, \r\nCanada, the European Union, Israel, Japan, the members \r\nof the Melanesian Spearhead Group, New Zealand, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the \r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States of America — I \r\noffer many thanks to them all. It has been a long and \r\nsometimes traumatic journey for our nation in the \r\n44 years since independence: four coups, a rebellion, \r\nfour Constitutions and 56 days of shame in 2000 when \r\nmembers of our Parliament were held hostage.\r\nFiji has struggled to be unified and cohesive; our \r\ndevelopment was retarded by our inability to think and \r\nwork as one nation, one people. But with the recent \r\nelection, we have put that era firmly behind us. In \r\nour new democracy, we are all Fijians, not members \r\nof separate ethnic and religious groups. And having \r\nestablished a common and equal citizenry, along with \r\na secular State, we intend to move forward together \r\nto finally fulfil our promise as a nation, to fulfil our \r\ndestiny.\r\nI especially want to pay tribute today to the Fijian \r\npeople. I say to them today before the world: this was \r\ntheir victory. Whichever candidate they chose, theirs \r\nwas a vote for a better future for our nation. I pledge \r\nagain that I will govern for the benefit of all our citizens, \r\nno matter who they are, where they come from or who \r\nthey voted for. Mine will be an inclusive Government \r\nover the next four years. I will be the leader of all Fijians, \r\nfor all Fijians. As we move our beloved nation forward, \r\nI am determined to leave no one behind. In that spirit, I \r\nextend a hand of friendship to my political opponents. \r\nWhatever our differences, let us now work together \r\nconstructively in our new Parliament, when it convenes \r\non 6 October, to improve the lives of every Fijian. \r\nWe are currently enjoying the most sustained period \r\nof economic growth in our history. The possibility to \r\ncreate more jobs and raise the living standards of our \r\npeople has never been greater. Let us join hands to put \r\nour nation first, to put Fiji first.\r\nI want to assure our Pacific neighbours of Fiji’s \r\ncontinuing contribution to the region as we work \r\ntogether and collaborate to resolve the great challenges \r\nfacing us, develop our economies and improve the lives \r\nof all Pacific islanders. Fiji has played a leading role \r\nin the formation of the Pacific Islands Development \r\nForum, an addition to the existing regional framework, \r\nwhich, for the first time, links Governments with civil \r\nsociety groups and the private sector in a joint effort \r\nto solve our development problems in a sustainable \r\nmanner.\r\nFiji is privileged to have been given the \r\nresponsibility of hosting the Pacific Island Development \r\nForum Secretariat in our capital, Suva. We were equally \r\nprivileged that the outgoing Indonesian President, \r\nSusilo Bambang Yudhoyno, was our principal guest at \r\nthis year’s Forum in June.\r\nIn this International Year of Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, we need a more concerted effort to \r\nstrengthen our regional institutions in order to confront \r\nthe enormous challenges we face in the Pacific, namely, \r\npopulation growth, the unsustainable use of our ocean’s \r\nnatural resources and rising sea levels caused by climate \r\nchange. Climate change threatens to engulf some of our \r\nPacific Island States altogether, and is already forcing \r\nthe evacuation of coastal villages in Fiji.\r\nI repeat here what I have said in other forums: \r\nhistory will judge the world’s major carbon-emitters \r\nextremely harshly, unless they take immediate and \r\ncomprehensive steps to reduce emissions. It is simply \r\nnot acceptable, purely in moral terms, for the world to \r\nallow the small island developing States to sink slowly \r\nbeneath the waves because of the selfish determination \r\nof industrialized nations to protect their own economies. \r\nTime is fast running out, and I beg Governments to act.\r\nI am also here to rededicate ourselves as a nation \r\nto the ideals of the United Nations and to its service, \r\nwhenever and wherever it is required. That service is at \r\nthe core of our foreign policy, whose central purpose is \r\nto be friends to all and enemies to none. It has been our \r\nprivilege to chair the largest voting bloc at the United \r\nNations, the Group of 77 and China, and this year to \r\nassume the Presidency of the Executive Board of the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\r\nFor some 36 years now, Fiji has proudly contributed \r\nour troops to successive peacekeeping operations in \r\nLebanon, Sinai, Iraq, Syria, Timor-Leste, South Sudan, \r\nDarfur, Liberia, Bosnia, Kosovo, Kuwait, Namibia, \r\nCambodia and the Solomon Islands. Some of those \r\npeacekeepers have paid with their lives — as have \r\ntroops from other countries — and we honour those \r\nwho have fallen in the cause of peace. Last month, 45 of \r\nour soldiers currently serving with the United Nations \r\nDisengagement Observer Force, were held captive. \r\nAs a nation, we held grave fears for their safety, but \r\n14-55126 25/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nafter two anxious weeks our prayers were answered, \r\nand our men were freed. I want to thank the skilful \r\nteam of United Nations negotiators who worked with \r\nour military officers and diplomats in a tireless effort \r\nto secure the release of our men. I also warmly thank \r\nthose nations that came to Fiji’s assistance during that \r\ntrying period. We will never forget the role played by \r\nthose Governments in keeping our men safe so that they \r\ncan continue to fulfil their United Nations mandate and \r\neventually return safely to their families and friends in \r\nFiji.\r\nI am proud to say that not once during the course of \r\nthat crisis were there any calls in Fiji for the withdrawal \r\nof our troops from that, or future, peacekeeping \r\nmissions. Peacekeeping is a noble cause and is our \r\ncontribution to the welfare of ordinary men and women \r\nliving in less fortunate circumstances far from our \r\nisland home. I want everyone to know that Fiji will \r\nalways be ready to serve.\r\nTo strengthen our commitment to meeting our \r\ninternational obligations, this year Fiji opened a \r\nPermanent Mission to the United Nations in Geneva, \r\nwhich is focused on strengthening our interaction \r\nwith treaty bodies, such as the Human Rights Council, \r\nthe International Labour Organization, the World \r\nTrade Organization, the World Intellectual Property \r\nOrganization, the International Telecommunication \r\nUnion and other organizations based in Geneva.\r\nIn closing, Fiji looks forward to contributing \r\npositively to the work of the United Nations during the \r\nPresident’s stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. On behalf of all Fijians, I pledge our full \r\nsupport and cooperation as the President carries out his \r\ntasks in the cause of the great global family to which \r\nwe all belong.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime \r\nMinister of Tuvalu\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of \r\nTuvalu, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, \r\nPrime Minister of Tuvalu, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Sopoaga (Tuvalu): It is indeed a great \r\nhonour and pleasure to participate in this General \r\nAssembly debate at its sixty-ninth session on behalf \r\nof the Government and people of Tuvalu. I extend my \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kutesa on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. We wish the Assembly success under his able \r\nguidance. I also wish to thank the outgoing President, \r\nAmbassador John Ashe, for a successful sixty-eighth \r\nsession. Likewise, I applaud Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, the Secretariat and all the specialized United \r\nNations agencies and staff for their tireless efforts and \r\nenergy.\r\nLet me also note for the record Tuvalu’s sincere \r\ncongratulations to the people and the new Government \r\nof Fiji under Prime Minister Bainimarama for the \r\nsuccessful holding of general elections. In the same \r\nvein, we also congratulate New Zealand on its \r\nsuccessful elections.\r\nThrough the United Nations, we have worked \r\ndiligently to deliver on the noble visions and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. Our \r\nshared goals are world peace, security and prosperity. \r\nTuvalu celebrates its thirty-sixth anniversary of \r\nindependence next week on 1 October, and we remain \r\ncommitted and proud to be a Member of this great \r\nbody. We must applaud the achievements of the United \r\nNations.\r\nBut we should not be over-congratulatory. Tuvalu \r\nalso feels the sadness of the loss of lives and the suffering \r\nof fellow human beings from crises the world over. The \r\nlosses resulting from terrorism, poverty, environmental \r\ndegradation — especially climate change — and Ebola, \r\nalong with the loss of lives owing to political conflicts \r\nin Syria, Israel, Palestine, the Middle East, Ukraine and \r\nmany other regions of the world, are most disturbing, \r\neven for distant countries like my own Tuvalu in the \r\nPacific. Tuvalu shares in the grief of those people. We \r\nin the United Nations must work harder to address the \r\nroot causes of such crises. We support the ongoing \r\nreform efforts in the United Nations, and in particular \r\nwe urge the reform of the Security Council through an \r\nexpansion of its permanent and non-permanent seats \r\nand its agenda, in order to include climate change as a \r\nSecurity Council issue.\r\n26/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nAs we go on, though, one question stares us right \r\nin the eyes. Do we leaders really care? And do we mean \r\nwhat we say here at the United Nations, in this great \r\nHall? Recently a kindergarten class in Tuvalu asked me \r\nthis question: “Do we have a tomorrow, and can you, \r\nas Prime Minister, save us?” Reflecting on how this \r\nbody can help respond to those fundamental questions \r\ngives me mixed feelings. We are indeed encouraged by \r\nthe momentum of some strong leadership on climate \r\nchange, as was displayed at the Climate Summit earlier \r\nthis week.\r\nBut we are also discouraged by the lack of concern \r\ndisplayed most conspicuously by the deniers of climate \r\nchange, including some of our neighbours in the Pacific. \r\nTuvalu believes that the United Nations must not be \r\ndistracted by them. We must remain committed to \r\nturning the momentum of the political leadership set in \r\nmotion this week into real action for a more collective, \r\nstrategic and pragmatic response to world crises. We \r\nmust walk the walk, as well as talk the talk, on every \r\nfront of our human crises if we are to ensure global \r\npeace and security.\r\nWe have talked a lot in the United Nations about \r\ndesigning sustainable development goals and a post-\r\n2015 development agenda. The tentative goals and \r\ntargets identified are reflective of a membership that is \r\nseeking the same high aspirations and honourable goals \r\nas those enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nnamely, a world of peace, security, opportunity and \r\nprosperity. The United Nations must remain universal \r\nand relevant in bringing the real issues and events into \r\nfocus and keeping the attention of the global community. \r\nIt should be more responsive and understanding of the \r\ndiverse circumstances and needs of its membership \r\nand the importance of contextualizing its strategic \r\nactivities, taking into account the variable and special \r\ncircumstances of each Member. It must also improve \r\nits presence in all countries, particularly in vulnerable \r\nStates like Tuvalu.\r\nWe must also heed the lessons of the world \r\nfinancial crisis, which reversed some of our hard-\r\nearned development advances related to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Those global realities \r\naffect even remote, small island countries like Tuvalu, \r\nand can further exacerbate their vulnerabilities. \r\nThe new sustainable development goals, with better \r\naccountability and transparency measures, must provide \r\neconomies, big or small, with the capacity to address \r\nvulnerabilities and ensure sustainability. They must \r\nalso help to improve the means of implementation and \r\ncreate governance mechanisms that are inclusive and in \r\nwhich the voices of all countries and all stakeholders, \r\nincluding local Governments and authorities, are heard \r\nin decision-making.\r\nThe dedication of 2014 as the International Year \r\nof Small Island Developing States (SIDS) is much \r\nappreciated. At the beginning of this month we \r\ncongregated in the beautiful and tranquil island of the \r\nindependent State of Samoa for the Third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States, which \r\nconcluded with an outcome document outlining the \r\nSmall Island Developing States Accelerated Modalities \r\nof Action, or Samoa  Pathway, and with the creation \r\nof many constructive partnerships aimed at addressing \r\nthe special needs and circumstances of SIDS.\r\nWhile Tuvalu acknowledges and greatly appreciates \r\nthe support of the United Nations membership, and \r\nthe exemplary leadership of the Samoan Government \r\nand people, leading to the Conference’s huge success, \r\nwe also believe that the ultimate measure of success \r\nfor SIDS is the delivery of tangible action on the \r\nground, reflecting and accommodating their unique, \r\nspecial case. It is urgent that we seriously consider \r\nthe proper integration of the SAMOA Pathway and a \r\nspecial window for SIDS into the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda of the United Nations, and into \r\nall other programmes in the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies, in order to achieve their effective \r\nimplementation, with particular attention to simplified \r\naccess to climate change financing for small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nThe graduation criteria and their application to \r\nleast-developed countries (LDCs) require proper \r\nscrutiny and review, because they are mostly not \r\nrelevant to the characteristics of SIDS. A small island \r\ndeveloping State may achieve a high per capita gross \r\nnational income and a high human development index, \r\nbut it will always be a small island developing State; \r\none cannot graduate from the natural constraints and \r\nenvironmental vulnerabilities of being a small island \r\ndeveloping State. Recognizing the call made in the \r\nSAMOA Pathway and given the ambiguity surrounding \r\nthe recommendations for Tuvalu’s LDC graduation, \r\nTuvalu seeks further deferral of that graduation until \r\na thorough assessment and review of the application \r\nof LDC graduation is done, taking full account of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s \r\n14-55126 27/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nrecent Least Developed Countries Report 2013 and \r\nother studies dealing with Tuvalu.\r\nWith Tuvalu’s 24 square kilometres of land \r\njuxtaposed against 900,000 square kilometres of the \r\nPacific Ocean, the sea has always been our people’s \r\nlifeline to food and economic growth. As a custodian of \r\nthe Pacific Ocean, Tuvalu fully supports a sustainable \r\ndevelopment goal on oceans, as we do the Palau \r\nDeclaration on oceans issued by the leaders of the \r\nPacific Islands Forum. We call on the United Nations \r\nto honour the health of the oceans, because they are \r\nthe Earth’s life-support system. To that end, we also \r\nsupport the commencement of negotiations towards an \r\nimplementing agreement under the law of the sea that \r\ncan better protect the oceans.\r\nThe seriousness and urgency of the need for action \r\nto combat climate change have been reaffirmed, not only \r\nby the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change but also by world leaders, \r\nand was strongly echoed by youth leaders this week \r\nin this very Hall. What more do we need to hear to \r\nstop the denial of the need for action against climate \r\nchange? In Tuvalu, we are experiencing unprecedented, \r\nlife-threatening effects of climate change. As a low-\r\nlying country with an elevation of barely two or three \r\nmetres above sea level, like our fellow atoll island \r\nnations of Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Maldives, \r\nTokelau and all other small island developing States, \r\nTuvalu is finding that its security and survival, and \r\nthe future and human rights of its citizens, are being \r\nseriously compromised. We cannot continue along that \r\npath.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s Climate Summit, held \r\nearlier this week, which, on behalf of Tuvalu, I was \r\nhonoured to co-chair with the President of Bolivia, gave \r\nus yet another opportunity to hear from young people, \r\nwomen and community leaders on the front line of the \r\nimpacts of climate change from every region of the \r\nworld, including my own Pacific region. Their message \r\nfrom the front line is simple, loud and clear: leaders of the \r\nworld, do it! Save us!\r\nTime is running out, and it would be grossly immoral, \r\nextremely irresponsible and even illegal to pretend that \r\nwe did not hear the alarms and voices of those who are \r\nsuffering at the forefront of climate change. Tuvalu \r\nhighly commends the Secretary-General for his strong \r\nleadership and welcomes the annoucements made by \r\nthose Heads of State and Government who contributed \r\nto actions against climate change during the Summit. \r\nWe commit to building on that momentum and that of the \r\nrecent SIDS meeting up to the Lima meeting later this year \r\nand onwards in Paris in 2015.\r\nTuvalu fully supports a stand-alone sustainable \r\ndevelopment goal on climate change. We urgently need \r\na commitment from all countries to supporting a new \r\nclimate change protocol, to be concluded in Paris in 2015. \r\nWe must urgently address climate change in a legal and \r\nforward-looking manner. Otherwise, our post-2015 agenda \r\nwill be meaningless and many will be left behind. We \r\ntherefore urge all parties to work urgently to negotiate a \r\nnew protocol, to curb greenhouse gas emissions and to \r\nkeep the average temperature rise well below 1.5°C. The \r\nprotocol must include loss and damage and insurance \r\nmechanisms for SIDS against climate change and must \r\nprovide adequate and accessible financing for adaptation \r\nsupport to SIDS, such as Tuvalu.\r\nThere is no time for half-measures, such as we \r\nwitnessed in Copenhagen in 2009. It is also critical that \r\nthe new Green Climate Fund and the other existing climate \r\nchange funds be adequately resourced and that access by \r\nSIDS be simplified for expedient action on the ground.\r\nWe all must step up and commit to reducing our \r\nemissions and to supporting those who are vulnerable. As \r\nfor my own country, despite our negligible greenhouse gas \r\nemissions, we are committed to employing 100 per cent \r\nrenewable energy for our electrification by the year 2020. \r\nWe are already well on the way to achieving that target, \r\nthanks to the generous support of international partners, \r\nincluding the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, Italy, \r\nAustria, the United Arab Emirates, the International \r\nUnion for Conservation of Nature and the International \r\nRenewable Energy Agency. Tuvalu is also a party to the \r\nMajuro Declaration.\r\nTuvalu has made steady progress towards the \r\nachievement of its MDGs, with strategic complementary \r\nassistance from the donor community. We have designed \r\na road map for development to move forward from the \r\nMDGs, and to the sustainable development goals in \r\ngeneral. We have adopted and implemented national \r\npolicies on financial management, women and gender \r\ndevelopment, people with disabilities, young people and \r\nthe protection of families, as well as on other sectors of \r\nnational priority, such as climate change, energy, food \r\nsecurity, fisheries, information technology, health care, \r\neducation and outer islands development. Much needs to \r\nbe done in order to properly deliver on those policies. We \r\n28/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nare committed to doing that. We call for support from our \r\ninternational partners through mutual partnerships with us \r\nin Tuvalu.\r\nThe future we want is one of inclusiveness, where all \r\npartnerships are important. The Government of Tuvalu \r\nreiterates its position that the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba runs counter to the need to \r\npromote dialogue and to fulfil the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, which calls for \r\nsolidarity, cooperation and friendly relations among all \r\nnations.\r\nTuvalu also fully supports Taiwan’s meaningful \r\nparticipation in United Nations specialized agencies and \r\nmechanisms, including the World Health Organization, \r\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. We recognize the cooperative spirit shown by \r\nTaiwan in its involvement in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda dialogue. We recognize the need to include \r\nTaiwan in the global fight against climate change. We also \r\nrecognize Taiwan’s role as a regional peacemaker. Taiwan \r\nsupports scholarships and capacity-building for experts, \r\nstudents and officials from Tuvalu and many developing \r\ncountries.\r\nFinally, I want to say the following in clear and \r\nunambiguous terms. We are at a turning point for the \r\nfuture of small island nations such as Tuvalu. We can \r\ncreate MDGs and design sustainable development goals \r\nbut, unless there is a global commitment to those goals, \r\nparticularly against climate change, we will have failed \r\nhumankind. Unless we stop greenhouse gas pollution, we \r\nwill have failed future generations. The future is ours to \r\ncreate. Let us be bold. Let us take heed of the strong and \r\nloud message from those on the front line that we have \r\nheard here in this very Hall. Let us be seen as the ones \r\nthat created a future for all — a future that includes saving \r\nhuman beings and saving the children of Tuvalu. For if we \r\nsave Tuvalu, we save the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Tuvalu \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of \r\nTuvalu, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Agila Saleh Essa Gwaider, President of the House of \r\nRepresentatives of Libya.\r\nMr. Gwaider (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to express my sincerest congratulations to \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am confident \r\nthat he will steer the work of this session towards the best \r\nresults. Allow me also to commend the efforts of Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for \r\nachieving the objectives of the Organization and for \r\npromoting international peace and security. I would like \r\nto thank him in particular for standing with the Libyan \r\npeople during the revolution against the dictatorship and \r\nfor providing support for our nascent democracy after the \r\nrevolution.\r\nI am honoured to stand before members today as \r\nthe representative of the Libyan people to describe their \r\nambitions, pains and hopes, to participate in the quest \r\nfor the best ways to maintain peace and security on our \r\nplanet and to achieve the common aspirations of our \r\npeoples. There is no doubt that those who witnessed the \r\nrevolution of the Libyan people against dictatorship in \r\n2011 were impressed by the courage, unity, awareness \r\nand creative capabilities of our people. But today there \r\nis no doubt that many are astonished by events in \r\nLibya — the fighting, the bloodshed among brothers, \r\nthe unjustified destruction of infrastructure and public \r\nand private property. Many may wonder, where are \r\nthe people they saw three years ago? Where are the \r\nunarmed revolutionaries who flocked into the streets, \r\nfacing bullets with their bare chests to defend their \r\nrights? Where are the intellectuals who flooded the \r\nmedia with realistic assessments and convinced the \r\nworld of the justice of their people’s cause?\r\nI would say, yes, that was the true Libyan people. \r\nThey did not think in terms of material gains or leadership \r\npositions. Their only aspiration was to put an end to \r\ndictatorship and pave the road for democracy to ensure \r\na prosperous future for all Libyans. Unfortunately, \r\nLibya today is in a completely different situation. Most \r\nof the activists have left the political arena, either \r\nbecause of the forcibly imposed political isolation law \r\nor because of the campaigns of intimidation, arrests and \r\nassassinations perpetrated by various armed groups \r\nagainst anyone who opposes their views or calls for \r\ntheir disarmament and demobilization.\r\nSome armed groups are no longer subject to the \r\nGovernment’s direction as they try to impose their \r\nwill on the Libyan people by force, violate human \r\nrights and blackmail the Government to gain access \r\nto funds, while they refuse to arm the police and to \r\n14-55126 29/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nreinstitute, reconstruct and arm the army. The existing \r\nconflict in and around Tripoli among armed groups \r\nthat opposed the legitimate authorities has forced the \r\nGovernment to evacuate all of its premises, which \r\nwere seized by a coalition of armed groups. Those \r\nincluded a terrorist group that professes Al-Qaida \r\nideology and is known for its stand against the building \r\nof State institutions — a group placed on the list of \r\nterrorist organizations by the United States and the \r\nEuropean Union. Moreover, the residences of many \r\nministers and citizens were looted and burned down. \r\nThat group is still waging war on the region west of \r\nthe city of Tripoli, inhabited by the Warshafana tribe. \r\nThe indiscriminate shelling with heavy weaponry led \r\nto the exodus of most of its population, which then led \r\nthe House of Representatives to declare it a disaster \r\narea. That could not have happened if the international \r\ncommunity had taken the situation in Libya seriously, \r\nassisted the Government in establishing a strong army, \r\nexerted pressure to ensure the disarmament of armed \r\ngroups and supported the arming of the police.\r\nThe armed groups that captured the capital have \r\nclearly declared their opposition to the legitimate \r\ninstitutions of the State and their quest to overthrow \r\nthe elected House of Representatives and the elected \r\nGovernment, in an apparent effort to derail the process \r\nof democratic transition and topple the legitimate \r\nauthorities by forming a parallel Government. \r\nFurthermore, that has not sufficed for the group that \r\ncontrols Tripoli. It has also persecuted political activists, \r\nhuman rights defenders and journalists, shut down \r\nmedia channels and forcibly prevented opponents from \r\ndemonstrating in the city of Tripoli and other cities. It \r\nhas recruited media personnel and some radical clerics \r\nto incite the killing of those with different opinions and \r\nthose who support the elected House of Representatives \r\nand the Government.\r\nThe group has allied itself with Ansar Al-Sharia, \r\nwhich professes the ideology of Al-Qaida. It has \r\npractised terrorism in some Libyan cities, especially \r\nBenghazi and Derna. It has provided a safe haven and \r\ntraining camps for terrorists from all over the world, \r\nincluding Tunisia, Algeria, Egypt and Mali, with \r\nunrivalled financial and media support from outside the \r\ncountry, in order to undermine the legitimate Libyan \r\nauthorities and enable it to implement its conspiracy.\r\nI wish the Assembly to know that turning a blind eye \r\nto terrorism in Libya is no longer acceptable. Our people \r\ncan no longer tolerate assassinations, humiliation, \r\nintimidation, suppression of freedoms or human rights \r\nviolations based on an individual’s background and \r\nbelief. The international community can either stand \r\nwith the elected legitimate authorities and implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2174 (2014) by imposing \r\nsanctions on those who impede the political process, \r\nundermine security and seize State institutions, or \r\naffirm loudly and clearly that the Libyans have to take \r\non terrorism single-handedly. Surely, the international \r\ncommunity must take action to withstand the effects \r\nof the expansion of terrorism in North Africa and the \r\nSahel region.\r\nWe are in need of substantial assistance from \r\nLibya’s friends — help in rebuilding the army and \r\nproviding it with all it needs to stop the fighting among \r\nbrothers and battle terrorism and extremism, which \r\nnow form a broad front stretching from Iraq to Algeria. \r\nThat front cannot be eliminated without an alliance \r\nof the States concerned to ensure the elimination \r\nof terrorism and guarantee the dissemination of the \r\nprinciples of tolerance and democracy. The failure to \r\nprovide arms and training to the Libyan army in its war \r\nagainst terrorism serves the interests of extremism, \r\nadds to instability in Libya, disrupts calm in the region \r\nand threatens global peace.\r\nWe welcome all efforts and goodwill by friendly \r\ncountries, the United Nations, the League of Arab States \r\nand the African Union to help the legitimate Libyan \r\nauthorities regain control, either by taking a bold stand \r\nwith the House of Representatives, the Government and \r\nthe constitution-drafting body and by persuading armed \r\ngroups to give up their arms, withdraw from State \r\ninstitutions and obey the Government’s directions, or \r\nby exerting pressure on the political movements and \r\narmed groups so that they renounce violence and agree \r\nto a dialogue on the priorities and future of Libya.\r\nEvery illegitimate contact, unauthorized by the \r\nGovernment, of any foreign country with individuals, \r\ngroups and organizations that do not recognize the \r\nGovernment’s authority or that of the elected House \r\nof Representatives and that use violence as a means \r\nto impose their views on the Libyan people will be \r\nconsidered by the Government an unfriendly act against \r\nthe unity and stability of Libya. Hence, all necessary \r\nmeasures will be taken to confront it.\r\nThe Libyan people, under the leadership of the \r\nlegitimate authority, will not submit to blackmail and \r\nintimidation and will resist any attempt to impose \r\na totalitarian dictatorship, whatever its slogan. We \r\n30/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nwish that the Government did not need the assistance \r\nof brotherly and friendly countries to extend State \r\nauthority over its territory and eliminate the terrorism \r\nand criminality that threaten Libya’s security and unity, \r\ncausing the displacement of hundreds of thousands from \r\ntheir homes in various parts of Libya and destroying \r\nthe economy.\r\nThe House of Representatives and the Government \r\nare determined to pursue the path of dialogue and \r\ntolerance within the framework of legitimacy, solve \r\nall the problems and differences between Libyans, \r\nagree on priorities, respect the democratic process and \r\nre-establish the rule of law and the holding of elections. \r\nThey are also determined to demobilize all armed \r\ngroups and to stop their funding by the end of the \r\ncurrent year. We hope that the international community \r\nwill help us to carry out the following measures.\r\nFirst, we must ensure the establishment by the \r\nState of defence and security organs and make the \r\nGovernment the sole, legitimate authority capable \r\nof using force in disarming the armed groups and \r\nexercising its authority over all Libya’s territory.\r\nSecondly, we must ensure Government control \r\nover the capital, Tripoli, and the withdrawal of armed \r\ngroups from State institutions so that officials can work \r\nwithout being threatened and provide services to the \r\ncitizens.\r\nThirdly, we must realize that the establishment of \r\nillegal institutions set up in parallel with the existing \r\nbodies is impeding the political process and is subject \r\nto sanctions under Security Council resolution 2174 \r\n(2014).\r\nFourthly, we must establish genuine, active \r\ncooperation in combating terrorism through a strategic \r\nalliance between Libya and its neighbouring countries \r\nnorth and south of the Mediterranean.\r\nLastly, we must strengthen the culture of dialogue, \r\nwithout exclusion or marginalization, and, with the help \r\nof the United Nations Support Mission in Libya, the \r\nneighbouring countries, the League of Arab States and \r\nthe African Union, initiate a comprehensive dialogue \r\nfor all Libyan people.\r\nAs the General Assembly begins its deliberations \r\nat its sixty-ninth session, whose main theme is the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, I would like to point out \r\nthat when the Millennium Development Goals were \r\nset, Libya started to review its economic policies and \r\nrestructure its economy to achieve them. However, \r\nthe deteriorating security situation has disrupted the \r\neconomy. I would like to note the close interlinkages \r\namong security, stability and development. Without \r\nsecurity, there will be no development, and vice versa. \r\nTherefore, restoring security and stability in Libya is \r\nkey to advancing development, bringing the disrupted \r\neconomy back on track, achieving the remaining \r\nMillennium Development Goals and preparing to \r\nachieve the post-2015 development goals, once they are \r\nadopted.\r\nLibya looks forward to the support of the United \r\nNations and friendly countries in restoring security \r\nand the capacity-building of military and security \r\ninstitutions in order to ensure the launch of programmes \r\nfor reconstruction and development. We also look \r\nforward to the assistance of all countries in tracing looted \r\nfunds abroad and repatriating them to enable Libya to \r\nincrease funding for development and infrastructure \r\nprogrammes. That will help eliminate unemployment \r\nand absorb a large numbers of foreign workers, estimated \r\nat several millions, from neighbouring countries. Both \r\nLibya and the neighbouring countries would benefit, \r\nand illegal immigration to Europe of people in search \r\nof work and decent living conditions would be reduced.\r\nDespite the circumstances in Libya, we cannot \r\nforget the tragedy of the Palestinian people and their \r\nsuffering. They have taken refuge in various countries \r\naround the world because of the Israeli occupation. We \r\nreaffirm our condemnation of the Israeli occupation \r\nand its practices in the Palestinian and Arab occupied \r\nterritories. We call for the Security Council to \r\nprovide protection for the Palestinian people, set a \r\ntimetable to end the Israeli occupation and establish \r\nan independent and sovereign Palestinian State on all \r\nthe Palestinian territories, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital. The Palestinian State should be a full member \r\nof all international organizations. Palestinian refugees \r\nshould be entitled to return to their lands, from which \r\nthey were expelled.\r\nThe continued blockade and repeated Israeli \r\naggression against the Gaza Strip and the destruction \r\nof infrastructure have brought shame on civilized \r\nhuman beings. The international community should be \r\ncommitted to the reconstruction of Gaza, preventing \r\nthe recurrence of destruction and killing by the Israeli \r\narmy, ensuring the prosecution of all those responsible \r\nfor war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip and \r\nsupporting the efforts of the Government of national \r\n14-55126 31/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nreconciliation, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud \r\nAbbas.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Tanasak Patimapragorn, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand.\r\nMr. Patimapragorn (Thailand): I am here to pay \r\nmy country’s highest tribute to the United Nations for \r\nthe work it has done to improve the lives of people \r\naround the world. Thailand is fully committed to what \r\nthe United Nations stands for and to realizing through \r\nthe United Nations the hopes we all share. We are also \r\nfirmly committed to fulfilling our responsibilities as \r\na Member of the United Nations, because the United \r\nNations can achieve its vision only when we act together \r\nin unity.\r\nThis year, the theme is the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and how to truly make a difference in the lives \r\nof the people on the ground. Many countries have \r\nachieved many of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). For example, they have succeeded in reducing \r\npoverty and have achieved their education and health-\r\ncare goals. But there are many other countries for which \r\nachieving the MDGs has not been easy. Therefore, as \r\nwe move towards the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nwe must renew our commitments to make sure that no \r\none is left behind.\r\nFor Thailand, development is not just about gross \r\ndomestic product. To be sustainable, development must \r\ngo hand in hand with democracy, human rights and \r\npeace and security, the pillars of the United Nations. \r\nIt must be allowed to grow in an environment that \r\nis free from conflict. Building a strong and robust \r\ndemocracy is the challenge that many of us face. As in \r\nmany countries, Thailand has learned the lesson that \r\ndemocracy is more than having elections. Democracy \r\nmust be based on respect for the rule of law, and it must \r\nbe about good governance, transparency, accountability \r\nand equal access to justice.\r\nThat was not the case for my country before 22 May. \r\nBefore that date, we were at a political impasse. We \r\nhad a dysfunctional democracy. We were in danger of \r\nmore turmoil. And there was a very real possibility \r\nof bloodshed. Political opposition parties were given \r\nthe chance to save democracy, but they failed because \r\nthey were unwilling to compromise for the sake of \r\nthe country. That chain of unfortunate events made \r\nthe military intervention necessary. We all wished \r\nthat things had not had to turn out that way. But if the \r\nsituation had been allowed to continue, Thailand’s \r\ndemocracy would have been torn apart. That would \r\nhave undermined Thailand’s stability and the stability \r\nof the region.\r\nThailand is now going through a period of transition. \r\nWe remain fully committed to democracy and human \r\nrights, and we know we cannot go against the tide of \r\ndemocracy. Thailand needs a real and functioning \r\ndemocracy, one that delivers on the aspirations of \r\nthe people. Let there be no doubt that Thailand is not \r\nretreating from democracy. But we do need time and \r\nspace to bring about reconciliation, undertake political \r\nreform and strengthen our democratic institutions. We \r\ndo not want a repeat of what happened on 22 May.\r\nIn addition to implementing our road map for \r\nreturning to full democracy, we are also getting our \r\neconomy moving again. Confidence has returned and \r\ngrowth has been restored.\r\nThailand is committed to playing an active role \r\nwith its partners in the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) in order to build an ASEAN \r\ncommunity of peace and prosperity. We are committed \r\nto working with our partners in the international \r\ncommunity to address the many global challenges \r\nwe face, such as climate change, transnational crime, \r\npandemics and human trafficking. Most of all, we are \r\ncommitted to working with our partners to realize \r\nthe development agenda, because real and lasting \r\npeace is based not on State-centred security but on \r\npeople-centred security.\r\nDevelopment must transform people’s lives and \r\nopen the door to a better future for all. Development \r\nmust empower individuals, communities and societies. \r\nThat lies at the heart of the sufficiency-economy \r\nphilosophy of His Majesty the King of Thailand, and \r\nthat philosophy has guided our development efforts for \r\ndecades. The sufficiency economy is about promoting \r\nthe right values, drawing on the inner strengths of each \r\ncommunity and building resilience from the grass-\r\nroots level up. In doing so, we are able to lay a solid \r\nfoundation for sustainable economic development at \r\nthe national level.\r\nBut in today’s world, no nation can be an island of \r\nprosperity unto itself. More than ever, we need a strong \r\nglobal partnership, whether in order to realize the post-\r\n2015 development agenda or to meet shared challenges.\r\nFirst of all, that partnership must meet the \r\nchallenge of human security, the most pressing of our \r\n32/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\ntime. Human security is about human dignity, human \r\nrights, equity, equality and social justice, the promise \r\nof a better future for all and ensuring that in our rush \r\nfor development we do not sacrifice the environment \r\nthat sustains us. Ensuring human security should be at \r\nthe heart of sustainable development.\r\nBut while we advance the development agenda, we \r\ncannot ignore the immediate threats that require our \r\nconcerted action. Today we are confronted with some \r\nimmediate threats to the global partnership, such as the \r\nEbola crisis and the humanitarian crises in the Middle \r\nEast — Syria, Libya, Iraq and the Gaza Strip. It pains \r\nus to witness the senseless death of civilians, especially \r\nchildren, in the conflict in the Gaza Strip. The situation \r\ndemands that we work even harder to bring lasting peace \r\nto the Palestinian people and to meet their aspirations \r\nto statehood, as well as to affirm the legitimate right of \r\nthe Israeli people to security.\r\nAs the situation in the Middle East unfolds, we \r\nare also deeply concerned about the rising threat \r\nof radicalism and extremism. There can be no \r\njustification for the brutalities and atrocities we have \r\nseen. We must rise to that challenge to peace, to our \r\npeoples’ livelihoods and to the gains we have made in \r\neconomic and social development. While some radical \r\nand extremist movements have indeed been able to \r\ndraw recruits from many parts the world, their mission \r\nis nothing more than the use of terrorism and fear of to \r\nadvance their objectives.\r\nOur peace and security and development are \r\nall connected. In order to achieve them, we must all \r\ntry to contribute as much as we can and to meet our \r\ninternational responsibilities as best we can. Some of \r\nus may have the capacity to do more than others. But \r\nif we all do our part, we can make the world better and \r\nsafer. That is why Thailand has sent volunteers to its \r\nneighbours to work in health and education and why we \r\nsent medical teams to Japan in 2011 as part of the relief \r\nefforts following the earthquake and tsunami.\r\nThe Thai f lag and Thai personnel have been \r\nassociated with peacekeeping operations in many \r\nplaces around the world. We were in Timor-Leste and \r\nin the Sudan, and along the India-Pakistan border. \r\nAnd we were part of the coalition formed to combat \r\npiracy in the Gulf of Aden off the coast of Somalia. \r\nThe role of the military, however, is not limited to war \r\nand conflict alone. Even in times of peace it plays an \r\nimportant role, especially now, when we are dealing \r\nwith many challenges such as natural disasters. That \r\nis why Thailand is promoting humanitarian assistance \r\nand disaster relief cooperation in the ASEAN region \r\nand beyond. Perhaps the time has come for ASEAN to \r\nbegin to explore the idea of a regional humanitarian \r\nassistance disaster recovery task force.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAs members of the international community, \r\nwe must all share the responsibility to stay true to \r\nthe original promise of the United Nations, which \r\nis to promote social progress and better standards of \r\nliving in larger freedom for the peoples of the world. \r\nIt is because of Thailand’s commitment to the United \r\nNations that we have submitted our candidature for a \r\nseat on the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 \r\nterm and on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 \r\nterm. We hope our friends will once again give us their \r\ntrust and allow us to serve.\r\nWhether the issue is democracy, development or \r\npeace, we all must assume our responsibilities because \r\nwe are, after all, a family of United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany.\r\nMr. Steinmeier (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): The year \r\n2014 is a special one for Europeans — a special year \r\nof commemoration. In the summer 100 years ago, \r\nEuropean diplomacy failed and the world slid into the \r\nFirst World War. Seventy-five years ago, Germany \r\nattacked its neighbour Poland, plunging the world into \r\nthe Second World War. Twenty-five years ago, the \r\nBerlin Wall fell, bringing an end to the world’s decades-\r\nlong division into East and West.\r\nHowever, merely to look back and remember would \r\nnot be enough in this year of commemoration. On the \r\ncontrary, we must ask ourselves: what have we learned \r\nfor the future? The most important lesson learned \r\nfrom that history was the establishment of the United \r\nNations, for the United Nations embodies the world’s \r\nhope for peace. That hope derives from an idea which \r\nis as simple as it is revolutionary: there is peace when \r\nthe world sets rules for itself and replaces the law of \r\nforce with the force of law, when conflicts are resolved \r\nat the negotiating table and not on the battlefield, when \r\nthe world renounces, step by step, the cynical logic of \r\nviolence.\r\n14-55126 33/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nTo date, the United Nations has provided a universal \r\nfoundation for the hope for peace. But that universality \r\nis under threat from the ghosts of the past and from new \r\ndemons.\r\nIn 2014 our world seems to be unraveling. Crises are \r\ncoming at us thick and fast. That is why it is not enough \r\nsimply to call upon the United Nations. No, we need to \r\nbreathe life into that call. Hope will remain but a hope, \r\nan unattainable goal, unless States are prepared to take \r\non responsibility. The United Nations is not a forum \r\nonto which we can shrug off responsibility. The United \r\nNations is a forum whereby we assume responsibility.\r\nGermany, embedded in a united Europe, is prepared \r\nto take on responsibility in and with the United Nations. \r\nFirst and foremost we have a responsibility to the people \r\nbearing the brunt of the suffering in the crises.\r\nNext month Germany will host a conference in \r\nBerlin to mobilize urgently needed humanitarian \r\nassistance for the millions of Syrian refugees. My \r\ncountry will play its part, and I sincerely hope that \r\nmany others will follow suit. Support is needed above \r\nall by Syria’s neighbours. They are doing a tremendous \r\njob but are also under tremendous strain due to the huge \r\ninflux of displaced persons and refugees from Syria.\r\nThe Ebola epidemic is raging in West Africa. \r\nIt is bringing suffering and death into the homes of \r\nindividual families. It is endangering the cohesion \r\nof entire societies. That is why we are sending \r\nhumanitarian and medical assistance and setting up an \r\nairlift to the region. I am delighted that many volunteers \r\nin my country have responded to the call, saying, “I \r\nwant to go there to help on the spot”.\r\nAbove and beyond the immediate solidarity, \r\nhowever, we need a long-term commitment. We need \r\nthe expertise of the World Health Organization and \r\nthe coordinating umbrella of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly in the long term as we try to strengthen \r\nStates and health-care systems. Germany will contribute \r\nto both of those goals. We cannot bring the dead back to \r\nlife, but we may be able to prevent far too many more \r\npeople dying of Ebola who ought not to be dying if they \r\nwere treated. And we must certainly make sure that the \r\nnext epidemic does not have consequences as deadly as \r\nthe one we are still fighting.\r\nIf we are to move towards the hope of peace, we need \r\nmany small steps — the commitment of individuals, \r\nbilateral diplomacy and regional initiatives. But none \r\nof that can replace the United Nations. Only the United \r\nNations can provide a universal foundation for the hope \r\nof peace. That foundation is international law, to which \r\neveryone who belongs to the community of nations in \r\nthe United Nations, and those who want to belong, has \r\nsubscribed. That is what must be preserved; that is the \r\ncore of our hope for peace.\r\nThat is why I must here mention the conflict \r\nin Ukraine. Some people in the Hall may regard it \r\nas nothing more than a regional conflict in Eastern \r\nEurope. But I am convinced that that view is incorrect. \r\nI believe that that conflict affects each and every one of \r\nus. Not just any State, but a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council — Russia — has, with its annexation \r\nof Crimea, unilaterally altered existing borders in \r\nEurope and has thus violated international law. We \r\nmust counter that dangerous sign, because we must not \r\nallow the power of international law to be eroded from \r\nthe inside. We must not allow the old divisions between \r\nEast and West to re-emerge in the United Nations.\r\nBecause so much is at stake in that conflict, not \r\nonly for the people of Ukraine but also for the future of \r\ninternational law, Germany and its partners have taken \r\non responsibility and committed themselves vigorously \r\nto defusing the conflict. I am under no illusion: a \r\npolitical solution is still a long way off. However, just a \r\nfew weeks ago we were on the brink of a direct military \r\nconfrontation between Russian and Ukrainian armed \r\nforces. I am happy to say that diplomacy prevented the \r\nworst. Now the priority must be to bring about a lasting \r\nceasefire and achieve a political solution, one based on \r\nthe principles of the United Nations and preserving the \r\nunity of Ukraine.\r\nI am not discussing only Ukraine. As long as that \r\nconflict is simmering and as long as Russia and the \r\nWest are in a dispute over Ukraine, there is a threat \r\nof paralysing the United Nations. We therefore need a \r\nSecurity Council that is able and willing to act to tackle \r\nthe new and, in the long term, far more important tasks \r\nwe are facing. The world of 2014 is plagued not only by \r\nthe old ghost of division, but also by new demons.\r\nWe are all shocked by the unspeakable brutality of \r\nthe terrorists who misuse the name of God in carrying \r\nout their evil deeds. My question is, ought we not to \r\nbe particularly worried that the preachers of hate are \r\ndrawing in young people who have grown up in the \r\nmidst of our own societies?\r\nThat is why that, too, is not exclusively a regional \r\nconflict — a problem in Iraq or in Syria or in Africa, \r\n34/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nwhere terrorists are stamping on the fundamental rights \r\nof women and girls in particular. That barbarity is \r\ndirected against every one of us, and against everything \r\nfor which the United Nations stands.\r\nPrecisely for that reason, our response needs \r\nto go much further than the immediately necessary \r\nhumanitarian and military response. Germany is \r\nmaking substantial contributions to both, including \r\nmilitarily. But all that must be part of a political alliance \r\nagainst the terror of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \r\nMy country is strongly committed to that alliance, and \r\nI very much hope in particular that the societies of the \r\nMiddle East, realizing that far more is at stake than just \r\ntheir security, will also join.\r\nIn a world haunted both by old ghosts and new \r\ndemons, we have to be able to pursue both paths. On the \r\none hand, we must steadfastly continue to work towards \r\npolitical solutions in Ukraine, in the Middle East, in \r\nSyria, but at the same time we must tackle the huge \r\ntasks of the twenty-first century.\r\nI am referring to the fight against climate change. \r\nGermany is contributing $1 billion dollars to the Green \r\nClimate Fund. And we will support our closest partner, \r\nFrance, on the road to a successful Paris climate summit \r\nin 2015 and to a universal and legally binding climate \r\nconvention, which we urgently need.\r\nI am also referring to the digital age. Yes, the \r\nInternet should be a global, free, open and safe space. \r\nBut that is not a matter solely for Government agencies \r\nor big companies. That global, free, open and safe space \r\nmust be shaped by society as a whole. If we fail to act, \r\nthe vast technological possibilities will sweep aside the \r\nhuman dimension. We need an international law for the \r\ndigital world. Resolution 68/167, which we introduced \r\ntogether with Brazil, has made a start in that direction, \r\nI hope, at the United Nations.\r\nI am also referring to the post-2015 agenda, because \r\nthe fight against poverty begins with asking how we \r\nactually create value. How do we create prosperity? \r\nThat question is not only directed at a few countries \r\nin need of help. Rather, it is a call to the whole world \r\nfor more sustainable economic activity. With its shift to \r\nrenewable energies, Germany has set out on a path that, \r\nalthough not easy, is one the world must take if we want \r\nto preserve our natural resources and if the fight for \r\nscarce resources, water and arable land is not to become \r\nthe major conflict of the twenty-first century.\r\nOur children will judge us by those huge tasks. \r\nThey will look back, just as we are looking back at \r\nour forebears in this year of commemoration. Having \r\nlearned from two World Wars, our forebears established \r\nthe United Nations as their lesson to us. If we want to \r\ncontinue that lesson, if we want to master the tasks \r\nfacing us, then we must further develop this institution. \r\nThe United Nations is not a finished product. Perhaps it \r\nwill never be a finished product. It must evolve further, \r\nso that in all its parts, including the Security Council, it \r\nref lects today’s world.\r\nI believe that the United Nations is worth every \r\neffort, for in it lives the world’s hope for peace and a \r\nlegal order. I assure the Assembly that my country will \r\nplay its part in making that hope a reality, step by step.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThere is growing evidence today of a contradiction \r\nbetween the need for collective and partnership efforts \r\nin order to develop adequate responses to the challenges \r\ncommon to us all, on the one hand, and, on the other, \r\nthe aspiration of a number of States to domination and \r\na revival of the archaic bloc thinking based on military \r\ndrill discipline and the erroneous logic of friend or foe.\r\nThe United States-led Western alliance, which \r\nportrays itself as a champion of democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw and human rights within individual countries, acts \r\nfrom a directly opposite position in the international \r\narena, rejecting the democratic principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States enshrined the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and trying to decide for everyone \r\nwhat is good or evil.\r\nWashington has openly declared its right to the \r\nunilateral use of military force anywhere to advocate \r\nits own interests. Military interference has become a \r\nnorm, despite the dismal outcome of all the operations \r\ninvolving the use of force that the United States has \r\ncarried out in recent years.\r\nThe sustainability of the international system has \r\nbeen severely shaken by the NATO bombardment of \r\nYugoslavia, the intervention in Iraq, the attack against \r\nLibya and the failure in Afghanistan. It was due only \r\nto intensive diplomatic efforts that aggression against \r\nSyria was prevented in 2013. The various colour \r\nrevolutions and other schemes aimed at changing \r\n14-55126 35/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nunsuitable regimes inevitably give the impression that \r\ntheir goal is to create chaos and instability.\r\nToday Ukraine has fallen victim to that policy. \r\nThe situation there has revealed the deep-rooted and \r\nsystemic f laws remaining in the existing Euro-Atlantic \r\narchitecture. The West has embarked on a course \r\ntowards a vertical structuring of humankind tailored to \r\nits own standards, which are hardly inoffensive.\r\nAfter the West declared victory in the Cold War \r\nand the so-called end of history, the United States and \r\nthe European Union opted to expand the geopolitical \r\narea under their control without taking into account \r\nthe balance of legitimate interests of all the peoples \r\nof Europe. The Western partners did not heed our \r\nnumerous warnings with regard to the unacceptable \r\nviolations of the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the Helsinki Final Act, and time and again \r\nthey have avoided serious joint work to establish a \r\ncommon space of equal and indivisible security and \r\ncooperation from the Atlantic to the Pacific Oceans.\r\nThe Russian proposal to draft a European security \r\ntreaty was rejected. We were told directly that only the \r\nmembers of the North Atlantic Alliance can have legally \r\nbinding security guarantees, and the NATO expansion \r\nto the East continued in spite of the promises to the \r\ncontrary given earlier. NATO’s instant switch to hostile \r\nrhetoric and the reduction of its cooperation with Russia, \r\neven to the detriment of the West’s own interests, and \r\nthe additional build-up of military infrastructure along \r\nRussia’s borders revealed the inability of the Alliance \r\nto change the genetic code embedded in it during the \r\nCold War.\r\nThe United States and the European Union supported \r\nthe coup d’état in Ukraine, recklessly justifying any \r\nacts by the self-proclaimed Kyiv authorities, who \r\nopted to suppress by force that part of the Ukrainian \r\npeople who had rejected the attempts to impose an \r\nanti-constitutional order throughout the country and \r\nwanted to defend their rights to their native language, \r\nculture and history. It is precisely the aggressive assault \r\non those rights that compelled the population of Crimea \r\nto take its destiny in its own hands and make a choice \r\nin favour of self-determination. That was an absolutely \r\nfree choice, no matter what was invented by those \r\nwho were responsible in the first place for the internal \r\nconflict in Ukraine.\r\nThere have been attempts to distort the truth and \r\nhide facts behind blanket accusations at all stages of the \r\nUkrainian crisis. Nothing has been done to track down \r\nand prosecute those responsible for the bloody February \r\nevents at Maidan and the massive loss of human lives \r\nin Odessa, Mariupol and other regions of Ukraine. The \r\nscale of the appalling humanitarian disaster provoked \r\nby the acts of the Ukrainian army in south-eastern \r\nUkraine has been deliberately understated.\r\nRecently, horrifying new facts came to light when \r\nmass graves were discovered near Donetsk. Despite \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2166 (2014), a thorough \r\nand independent investigation into the circumstances \r\nof the loss of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 over \r\nUkrainian territory has been delayed. Those guilty for \r\nall those crimes must be found and brought to justice. \r\nOtherwise, national reconciliation in Ukraine can \r\nhardly be expected.\r\nRussia is sincerely interested in the restoration of \r\npeace in a neighbouring country, and that should be well \r\nunderstood by anyone even slightly acquainted with the \r\ndeep-rooted and fraternal relations between the two \r\npeoples. The path to a political settlement is known. \r\nAs early as this April, Kyiv made a commitment in the \r\nGeneva Statement on Ukraine — agreed upon by Russia, \r\nUkraine, the United States and the European Union \r\n(EU) — to immediately start a nation-wide dialogue \r\ninvolving all of Ukraine’s regions and political forces \r\nto implement constitutional reforms. The fulfilment \r\nof that obligation would allow all Ukrainians to agree \r\non how to live in accordance with their traditions and \r\nculture and would allow Ukraine to return to its organic \r\nrole as a link between the different parts of the European \r\nspace, which certainly implies the preservation and \r\nrespect by everyone of its non-aligned, neutral status. \r\nWe are convinced that with goodwill and the refusal \r\nto support the party of war in Kyiv, which is trying to \r\npush the Ukrainian people into the abyss of national \r\ncatastrophe, a way out of the crisis is within reach.\r\nA way to overcome the situation has opened with \r\na ceasefire agreement for south-eastern Ukraine on \r\nthe basis of initiatives of Presidents Poroshenko and \r\nPutin. With the participation of representatives of Kyiv, \r\nDonetsk, Luhansk, the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Russia, practical \r\nmeasures are being agreed on for the consecutive \r\nrealization of those agreements, including the separation \r\nof the parties, the withdrawal of the heavy weapons of \r\nthe Ukrainian military forces and of the militias, and \r\nthe organization of monitoring through the OSCE.\r\n36/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nRussia is ready to continue to actively promote a \r\npolitical settlement, both under the framework of the \r\nwell-known recommendations of the Minsk process \r\nand in other formats. But it should be quite clear that \r\nwe are doing this for the sake of peace, tranquillity \r\nand the well-being of the Ukrainian people, and not to \r\nappease someone’s ambitions. Attempts to put pressure \r\non Russia to force it to abandon its values  of truth and \r\njustice are absolutely futile.\r\nI will allow myself a digression into recent history. \r\nAs a condition for the establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations with the Soviet Union in 1933, the United \r\nStates Government demanded from Moscow guarantees \r\nof non-interference in the internal affairs of the United \r\nStates, obligations not to undertake any actions aimed at \r\nchanging the political and social structure of America. \r\nAt that time, Washington feared the revolutionary virus, \r\nand such guarantees were secured between America \r\nand the Soviet Union, on the basis of reciprocity.\r\nPerhaps it makes sense to return to that subject \r\nand reproduce the then demand of the American \r\nGovernment on a universal scale. Why not adopt a \r\nGeneral Assembly declaration about the inadmissibility \r\nof interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign \r\nStates and non-recognition of coups d’état as a \r\nmethod of regime change? It is time to fully exclude \r\nfrom international interaction attempts at illegitimate \r\npressure by some States against others. The meaningless \r\nand counterproductive nature of unilateral sanctions is \r\nobvious in the example of the American blockade of \r\nCuba.\r\nA policy of ultimatums and a philosophy of \r\nsuperiority and domination do not meet the needs \r\nof the twenty-first century; they are in conflict with \r\nthe objective processes of forming a polycentric, \r\ndemocratic world order. Russia promotes a positive, \r\nunifying agenda. We have always been and will be open \r\nto discussing the most difficult questions, no matter \r\nhow intractable they may seem at first. We will be \r\nready to seek a compromise and a balance of interests \r\nand to agree to exchange concessions, provided only \r\nthat the conversation is respectful and equitable.\r\nThe Minsk Agreement of 5 and 19 September about \r\nthe ways out of the Ukrainian crisis and the compromise \r\nabout the dates of entry into force of the Association \r\nAgreement between Kyiv and the European Union are \r\ngood examples to emulate, as is the readiness, at last, \r\nof Brussels to begin negotiations on establishing a free \r\ntrade area between the EU and the Customs Union of \r\nRussia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, as Mr. Putin suggested \r\nback in January.\r\nRussia has consistently advocated the harmonization \r\nof integration projects in Europe and Eurasia. \r\nAgreement on political benchmarks and terms such \r\nas “convergence of integration” would be a real \r\ncontribution to the work of the OSCE on the topic \r\nof Helsinki+40. Another important aspect of that \r\nwork would be to launch a pragmatic, de-ideologized \r\nconversation on politico-military architecture in the \r\nEuro-Atlantic area, so that not only members of NATO \r\nand of the Collective Security Treaty Organization but \r\nall the countries of the region, including Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Georgia, would enjoy equal \r\nand indivisible security and not have to make a false \r\nchoice of “either with us, or against us”. New dividing \r\nlines must not be allowed in Europe, especially because \r\nin the context of globalization they could become a \r\nwatershed between the West and the rest of the world.\r\nIt must be stated honestly that no one has a \r\nmonopoly on the truth; no one can forcibly tailor global \r\nand regional processes to suit their needs. Today there \r\nis no alternative to developing consensus on the rules \r\nof sustainable global governance in the new historical \r\nconditions, with full respect for the cultural and \r\ncivilizational diversity of the world and the multiplicity \r\nof development models. To attain such a consensus \r\non every issue will be difficult, perhaps tedious. But \r\nrecognizing that in every State democracy is “the worst \r\nform of Government except for all the others” also took \r\na long time, not until Churchill issued his verdict. It \r\nis time to recognize the inevitability of that axiom in \r\ninternational affairs, which currently suffer from a huge \r\ndeficit of democracy. Of course, someone will have to \r\nbreak the age-old stereotypes, to abandon claims to \r\neternal exceptionalism. But there is no other way.\r\nUnited efforts can be built only on the principles of \r\nmutual respect and mutual consideration of interests, as \r\nis done, for example, within the Security Council, the \r\nGroup of 20, the BRICS States of Brazil, Russia, India, \r\nChina and South Africa, and the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nCouncil.\r\nThe theory of the advantages of collective work \r\nare confirmed in practice, for instance, the progress \r\nin settling the situation concerning the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme and the successful completion of \r\nthe chemical demilitarization of Syria. By the way, \r\nspeaking of chemical weapons, I would like to obtain \r\nhonest information on the state of Libya’s chemical \r\n14-55126 37/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\narsenals. We understand that our NATO colleagues, \r\nhaving bombed the country in violation of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, do not want to stir up the disorder \r\nthey created. However, the problem of uncontrolled \r\nLibyan chemical arsenals is too serious to turn a blind \r\neye to. We believe the Secretary-General must show his \r\nresponsibility in that matter.\r\nThe main thing today is to see the global priorities \r\nand avoid making them hostage to a one-sided agenda. \r\nThere is an urgent need to refrain from double \r\nstandards in approaches to conflict resolution. By \r\nand large, everybody agrees that the key task is to \r\nresolutely counter the terrorists, who are trying to \r\ngain control of increasingly larger areas of Iraq, Syria, \r\nLibya, Afghanistan and the Sahel-Sahara region. That \r\nbeing the case, that problem cannot be sacrificed to \r\nideological schemes or to settle a score. Terrorists, \r\nwhatever slogans they hide behind, must be outlawed.\r\nAt the same time, of course, the fight against \r\nterrorism should be based on the solid foundation of \r\ninternational law. An important stage in that fight \r\nwas the unanimous adoption of a series of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, including those on the issue of \r\nforeign terrorist fighters. On the other hand, attempts \r\nto act contrary to the Charter of our Organization \r\ndo not contribute to the success of joint efforts. The \r\nfight against terrorists in Syria should be built on \r\ncooperation with the Syrian Government, which has \r\nclearly stated its willingness in that regard. Damascus \r\nhas already demonstrated its ability to cooperate with \r\nthe international community and to fulfil its obligations \r\nin the framework of the programme for eliminating its \r\nchemical weapons.\r\nFrom the very outset of the Arab Spring, Russia \r\nurged that it not be abandoned to the control of \r\nextremists, that a united front be created to counter the \r\ngrowing terrorist threat. We have warned against the \r\ntemptation to take as allies almost anyone who declared \r\nhimself an enemy of Bashar Al-Assad, whether \r\nAl-Qaida, Jabhat Al-Nusra and other fellow travellers \r\nof regime change, including the Islamic State of Iraq \r\nand the Levant (ISIL), which today is the focus of \r\nattention. As they say, better late than never. This is not \r\nthe first time that Russia is making a real contribution \r\nto the fight against ISIL and other terrorist groups in \r\nthe region. We are delivering large-scale supplies of \r\narms and military equipment to Iraq, Syria and other \r\nMiddle Eastern and North African countries, and we \r\nwill continue to support their efforts to suppress the \r\nterrorists.\r\nThe terrorist threat requires a comprehensive \r\napproach if we want to eradicate its causes and not \r\nbe doomed to reacting to the symptoms. ISIL is only \r\npart of the problem. We propose to organize, under the \r\nauspices of the Security Council, an in-depth study of \r\nthe threat of extremism and terrorism in all of their \r\naspects throughout the Middle East and North African \r\nregion. That integrated approach also presupposes \r\nthat chronic conflicts should be considered, above \r\nall the Arab-Israeli conflict. The failure to settle the \r\nPalestinian issue over several decades remains, as is \r\nwidely recognized, one of the main factors of instability \r\nin the region, and that helps extremists to recruit more \r\nand more new jihadists.\r\nAnother area of our common work together \r\ndemanding attention is uniting our efforts to implement \r\nthe decisions of the General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil to combat the Ebola virus. Our doctors are \r\nalready working in Africa. There are plans to send \r\nadditional humanitarian assistance, medical equipment \r\nand instruments, medicine and teams of experts to assist \r\nthe United Nations programmes in Guinea, Liberia and \r\nSierra Leone.\r\nThe United Nations was established on the ruins \r\nof the Second World War, and it is entering the year \r\nof its seventieth anniversary. We all have an obligation \r\nto celebrate in an appropriate manner the anniversary \r\nof the great victory and to pay tribute to the memory \r\nof all who perished for freedom and the right of each \r\npeople to determine their own destiny. The lessons \r\nof that terrible war and the entire course of events in \r\ntoday’s world require us to join efforts and forget about \r\nunilateral interests and national electoral cycles when \r\nit comes to countering global threats to all humankind. \r\nNational egoism should not be allowed to prevail over \r\ncollective responsibility.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wang Yi, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Wang Yi (China) (spoke in Chinese): This year \r\nmarks the centenary of the outbreak of the First World \r\nWar. A distinguished thinker in modern China, Yan Fu, \r\ndescribed the devastation caused by the war: “How sad \r\nthat the air is heavy with the stench of war”.\r\n38/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nNext year will be the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nend of the Second World War. Over 2 billion people \r\nacross the world were affected by that calamity. In \r\nChina alone, the aggression committed by Japanese \r\nmilitarists left more than 35 million Chinese soldiers \r\nand civilians dead or injured.\r\nThe United Nations was established to keep the \r\nscourge of the two World Wars from occurring again, \r\nand it embodies the fervent hope of all countries for \r\npeace and stability. To achieve that goal, the Charter \r\nof the United Nations presented a grand vision of joint \r\nefforts to build a better world.\r\nIn this world, we should treat each other as equals. \r\nThe principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nmust be upheld. The pursuit by different countries of \r\neconomic and social development must be respected. \r\nTheir right to independently choose their own social \r\nsystems and development paths must be safeguarded. \r\nWe should be open and inclusive. Only in that way \r\ncan we open the door of dialogue and exchange and \r\nachieve harmony among countries with different social \r\nsystems, religions and cultural traditions. We should \r\npursue mutually beneficial cooperation. Each country \r\nshould align its own interests with those of others and \r\nwork to maximize areas where their interests converge.\r\nOnly by helping one another can countries prosper. \r\nWe should jointly initiate a new thinking for win-win \r\nand all-win progress and reject the old notion of a zero-\r\nsum game, or the winner takes all. We should uphold \r\njustice. It is imperative to promote greater democracy \r\nand the rule of law in international relations, to apply \r\nfair and just rules to tell right from wrong and settle \r\ndisputes, and to pursue peace and development within \r\nthe framework of international law. All parties should \r\njointly uphold the authority and effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations and reform and improve the global \r\ngovernance structure.\r\nAs we have seen in Gaza, Iraq, the Central African \r\nRepublic and South Sudan, our world is far from \r\npeaceful. In the face of all those who have been killed \r\nin war, we must ask ourselves how we can keep the \r\ntragedies from recurring. In the face of women and \r\nchildren displaced by fighting, we must ask ourselves \r\nwhen they can return home. In the face of incessant \r\nconflicts, we must ask ourselves how we can open the \r\ndoor to lasting peace. To address those problems, China \r\nbelieves that we should do the following.\r\nFirst, we should seek political solutions. To beat \r\nswords into ploughshares may take time and effort, but \r\nhistory and reality have repeatedly demonstrated that \r\nto meet violence with violence will not lead to enduring \r\npeace, and the use of force will only create more \r\nproblems than solutions. Coercive action should be \r\nauthorized by the Security Council. If a country places \r\nits domestic law above international law and interferes \r\nin other countries’ internal affairs at will, or even seeks \r\nregime change, the international community cannot but \r\nquestion the legitimacy of its actions.\r\nSecondly, we should accommodate the interests \r\nof all parties. Parties to a conflict should reject the \r\nzero-sum approach, address each other’s concerns in \r\nnegotiations and endeavour to meet each other half \r\nway. They should seek to meet their legitimate concerns \r\nthrough consultations in a mutually accommodating \r\nway. When conducting mediation, the international \r\ncommunity should uphold justice and take an objective \r\nand balanced position. Countries should not be partial \r\nto any party in the conflict. Still less should they avail \r\nthemselves of the opportunity to pursue their own \r\nagenda.\r\nThirdly, we should promote national reconciliation. \r\nThe ongoing armed conflicts are largely caused by \r\nethnic and sectarian tensions. The process of national \r\nreconciliation and the process of political settlement \r\nshould be advanced in tandem with each other. All \r\nparties should uphold the Charter of the United \r\nNations, develop and practice a culture of inclusion and \r\ntolerance and uproot the seeds of hatred and retaliation, \r\nso that the fruit of inclusion and amity will grow on \r\npost-conflict land.\r\nFourthly, we should uphold multilateralism. We \r\nshould give full play to the role of the United Nations \r\nand observe international law and the basic norms \r\ngoverning international relations. Chapter VII of the \r\nCharter is not the only means for the Security Council \r\nto maintain international peace and security. We should \r\nmake better and full use of the means of prevention, \r\nmediation and conciliation stipulated in Chapter VI.\r\nGiven their familiarity with local developments, we \r\nshould leverage the strengths of regional organizations \r\nand countries and support them in addressing regional \r\nissues in ways suited to their regions.\r\nThe conflicts in Ukraine remain a cause of \r\nconcern. We welcome and support the Minsk ceasefire \r\nagreement and urge all parties in Ukraine to strictly \r\n14-55126 39/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nimplement it and seek a comprehensive, sustained \r\nand balanced political solution through political \r\ndialogue and negotiation. China hopes that the various \r\nethnic groups in Ukraine will live in harmony and \r\nthat Ukraine will live in peace with other countries. \r\nThat is the fundamental way for Ukraine to achieve \r\nlong-term stability and security. China hopes that \r\nthe United Nations will play its due role in finding a \r\nproper solution to the Ukrainian crisis and supports the \r\ninternational community’s constructive efforts to ease \r\nthe humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine.\r\nChina supports Iraq in upholding its sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity. The formation of \r\nthe new Iraqi Government has provided an important \r\nopportunity. We hope that the Iraqi Government will \r\nlead its people in a joint endeavour to develop their \r\ncountry in the spirit of inclusion and reconciliation. \r\nChina calls for providing more humanitarian assistance \r\nto support Iraq. To help the Iraqi people overcome \r\ndifficulties and to achieve peace and stability in their \r\ncountry is the shared responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nChina firmly opposes all terrorist acts and supports \r\nthe international community in responding to the \r\nthreat posed by terrorist forces in a coordinated and \r\nconcerted way in accordance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. China believes that in conducting \r\ninternational counter-terrorism cooperation, we should \r\ntake a multipronged approach and address both the \r\nsymptoms and root causes of terrorism, and that the \r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council should fully \r\nplay leading roles. There should be no double standard \r\nwhen it comes to fighting terrorism; still less should \r\nterrorism be identified with any particular ethnic group \r\nor religion.\r\nAs new developments emerge in the global fight \r\nagainst terrorism, the international community should \r\ntake new measures to address them. In particular, it \r\nshould focus on combating religious extremism and \r\ncyberterrorism, resolutely eliminate the root causes of \r\nterrorism and extremism, block channels that spread \r\nthem and crack down hard and effectively on the use of \r\nthe Internet and other new means of communication by \r\nterrorists to instigate, recruit, finance or plot terrorist \r\nattacks.\r\nThe Syrian crisis has continued for nearly four \r\nyears. It is negotiation, not fighting, that offers \r\nsolutions. China urges all parties in Syria to end the \r\nfighting and violence immediately, cooperate fully with \r\nUnited Nations humanitarian assistance operations and \r\nhelp bring an end to the suffering of innocent civilians \r\nas soon as possible. We urge all the parties to act in the \r\noverall interests of the future and fate of their country \r\nand people, demonstrate the necessary political will, \r\nactively support the mediation efforts of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his Special Envoy, and follow a middle \r\nway that draws on workable practices from other \r\ncountries and regions, suits Syria’s national conditions \r\nand accommodates the interests of various parties, in \r\norder to give peace a chance.\r\nThe Palestinian issue is an open wound on the \r\nconscience of humankind. China calls on Israel \r\nand Palestine to agree on a durable ceasefire, and it \r\nurges Israel to lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip and \r\nstop building settlements. At the same time, Israel’s \r\nlegitimate security concerns should be respected. We \r\nhope that Israel and Palestine will choose the way of \r\npeace and resume and advance the peace talks as soon \r\nas possible. The aspirations and legitimate demands of \r\nthe Palestinian people for an independent nation must \r\nnot remain unmet indefinitely. Advancing peace in the \r\nMiddle East calls for the concerted efforts of many, not \r\nof one or two countries alone. The Security Council \r\nshould play its rightful role, and we support its efforts \r\nto take action in response to the demands of Palestine \r\nand the League of Arab States.\r\nNegotiations on the Iranian nuclear issue have \r\nentered a crucial stage. All the parties should display \r\ngood faith, continue their efforts in a spirit of mutual \r\nrespect, equality, collaboration and accommodation, \r\nand work hard on the most difficult issues, so that a \r\nwin-win agreement that is comprehensive, fair and \r\nbalanced is arrived at as soon as possible.\r\nThe two sides of the conflict in South Sudan \r\nshould establish a ceasefire immediately, organize an \r\nactive political dialogue that addresses the interests \r\nof the people in South Sudan in general and, through \r\nthe mediation of the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development, work with all the country’s ethnic \r\ngroups and parties to speedily reach a fair and balanced \r\nsolution and achieve national reconciliation and ethnic \r\nunity. South Sudan is the youngest Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. The South Sudanese people deserve a \r\nlife of hope and vitality, not the devastation caused by \r\nconflicts and wars.\r\n40/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nChina welcomes the election of Mr. Ashraf Ghani \r\nas the new President of Afghanistan and Mr. Abdullah \r\nAbdullah as its Chief Executive, and will continue to \r\nsupport the Afghan people in their work to achieve a \r\nsmooth political, security and economic transition and \r\nto build jointly with them an Afghanistan that enjoys \r\nunity, stability, development and amity. We support \r\nan Afghan-led and -owned peace process, with the \r\ninternational community fulfilling its commitment and \r\nresponsibility to Afghanistan and its people. China will \r\nhost the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the Istanbul \r\nProcess so that we can give Afghanistan fresh support \r\nas it stands on the threshold of a new era.\r\nOn the issue of the Korean peninsula, China calls \r\non all the parties to act objectively and impartially, \r\nremain committed to the goal of denuclearizing the \r\npeninsula, firmly uphold its peace and stability, and \r\nendeavour to resolve the issues through dialogue and \r\nconsultation. The Six-Party Talks remain the only \r\nviable and effective way to resolve the nuclear issue on \r\nthe Korean peninsula, and we now have the pressing \r\ntask of restarting the talks as soon as possible. The issue \r\nshould be tackled through a sustainable, irreversible \r\nand effective dialogue process that addresses all the \r\nparties’ concerns in a comprehensive and balanced \r\nway. Since there are still many uncertainties on the \r\npeninsula today, all the parties concerned should \r\nexercise restraint, refrain from provocative acts, work \r\nharder to help ease tensions and jointly uphold peace \r\nand stability.\r\nWhile the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) established by the United Nations in 2000 \r\nhave contributed greatly to improving human survival \r\nand development, global development is still a task for \r\nthe long term. The international community is not only \r\ndealing with the formidable challenges of reducing \r\npoverty, eradicating hunger and improving education \r\nand the health of women and children, it is also facing \r\nnew challenges in the form of the environment, climate \r\nchange and energy and resource security.\r\nNext year is the deadline for meeting the MDGs, \r\nand the post-2015 development agenda will take \r\nover this historic mission. Building on past progress \r\nand also breaking new ground, the international \r\ncommunity should formulate more effective plans \r\nand take more robust action to advance humankind’s \r\nshared development. As we see it, the development \r\nagenda should have three goals. First, it should advance \r\npeople’s well-being, with a focus on eradicating \r\npoverty and encouraging development. Secondly, \r\nit should promote inclusiveness, in the interests of \r\nsupporting social equity and justice. Thirdly, it should \r\nensure the implementation of all these things. Based \r\non the principles of diversity in development models \r\nand shared but differentiated responsibilities, the \r\nagenda should aim to enhance global partnerships for \r\ndevelopment and improve implementation tools and \r\nmechanisms.\r\nClimate change is a challenge that all humankind \r\nis facing. Mr. Zhang Gaoli, Vice Premier of the State \r\nCouncil, led the Chinese delegation to this year’s \r\nClimate Summit at the United Nations as a special \r\nenvoy of China’s President. We congratulate the \r\nUnited Nations on the Summit’s success and hope that \r\nthe political momentum it generated will translate \r\ninto effective actions for improving international \r\ncooperation on climate change. All parties should \r\nwork to conclude negotiations on a new post-2020 \r\nclimate-change regime as scheduled, by the end of \r\n2015, in accordance with the principles of shared but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, equity and respective \r\ncapabilities, with the aim of creating fairer and more \r\nequitable and effective arrangements for international \r\ncooperation on climate change.\r\nThe Ebola epidemic, which is raging in some \r\nAfrican countries, has once again sounded the alarm \r\non global health security. As a good brother and partner \r\nof Africa, with whom it shares the good and the bad, \r\nChina will continue to stand firmly with the African \r\npeople and to support and assist them to the best of its \r\nability. We will also take an active part in the relevant \r\ninternational assistance efforts. China calls on the \r\nWorld Health Organization, the United Nations and \r\nother international agencies to work closely with the \r\ninternational community, come up with new initiatives \r\nfor strengthening global health security and provide \r\nmore assistance to developing countries, particularly in \r\nAfrica.\r\nNext year is one of special historic significance, \r\nas it marks the seventieth anniversary of victory in \r\nthe anti-fascist world war, the founding of the United \r\nNations and victory in the Chinese people’s war against \r\nJapanese aggression. Remembering the past makes us \r\ncherish peace, and recalling history will help to guide \r\nus as we embrace the future. China welcomes the \r\ninclusion of the seventieth anniversary of the end of the \r\nSecond World War on the agenda of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly as an important opportunity.\r\n14-55126 41/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nWhen we look back on what happened 70 years \r\nago, the historical facts are clear, and a final verdict \r\nhas been pronounced on what was right and what was \r\nwrong. History should not be falsified or truth distorted. \r\nToday, 70 years later, let us jointly uphold human \r\njustice and conscience so that those who attempt to \r\ndeny aggression and distort history will have nowhere \r\nto hide. Let us jointly defend the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the outcomes of the Second World War, \r\nso that that vision of a world free of war, with lasting \r\npeace, will take deep root in our hearts and pass from \r\none generation to the next.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pasquale Valentini, Minister for Foreign and \r\nPolitical Affairs of the Republic of San Marino.\r\nMr. Valentini (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe Government of the Republic of San Marino, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session, and to wish you every success in your \r\nwork. The delegation of the Republic of San Marino \r\nassures you, Sir, of its full cooperation throughout \r\nthe session. I would also like to express my country’s \r\ngratitude to the outgoing President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. John Ashe, for his work during the \r\nsixty-eighth session. My country also wishes to extend \r\nspecial thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nthe energy and determination with which he leads \r\nthe United Nations and for his sensitivity towards all \r\nMember States, without exception.\r\nIn particular, I would like to underscore the \r\nimportance of the climate change Summit organized by \r\nthe Secretary-General in New York on 23 September. \r\nIt provided the Heads of State and Government with \r\nthe opportunity to demonstrate their political will \r\nfor a global agreement on that issue. The Republic \r\nof San Marino contributed to the work through the \r\nparticipation of its Head of State, thereby underscoring \r\nthe importance and acknowledging the indissoluble link \r\nbetween climate change and sustainable development. \r\nThe effects of climate change, which are often tragic, \r\nare one of the most serious threats to the future of \r\nhumankind and a challenge that all States, in the context \r\nof a joint action coordinated by the United Nations, are \r\ncalled on to face with commitment and determination. \r\nWe are accountable to future generations for our ability \r\nto achieve the goals of environmental protection, energy \r\nsaving and energy generation from renewable sources.\r\nClimate change is one of the causes of many natural \r\ndisasters that have befallen our planet, including this \r\nyear. We need to respond effectively to the many very \r\nserious humanitarian emergencies, which show the \r\nclear interdependence of the global threats now facing \r\nhumankind. Today, a strong, rapid and coordinated \r\nresponse at the international level is necessary to \r\ndeal with the very serious outbreak of Ebola that has \r\ndeveloped in some West African States and has become \r\na global threat. The most affected countries must not \r\nbe left alone or isolated. On the contrary, they must \r\nbe supported and helped. San Marino was among the \r\nsponsors of resolution 2177 (2014), recently adopted \r\nby the Security Council, which underscores the need \r\nfor an immediate mobilization of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nWe are deeply moved by the problems at the \r\ninternational level, and, in the light of the theme \r\nof this session, “Delivering on and implementing a \r\ntransformative post-2015 development agenda”, we \r\nrecognize the need for a renewed commitment to \r\nfreeing the world from extreme poverty, inequality \r\nand hunger. However, we are aware that the full \r\nachievement of such goals is seriously compromised \r\nwhen peace and security, on the basis of respect for the \r\nequal dignity of all human beings, are not ensured. This \r\nyear, we have sadly witnessed too many incidents that \r\nrepresent a serious threat to peace, security and respect \r\nfor human rights. It is therefore impossible not to share \r\nthe widespread perception of a weakening of the United \r\nNations capacity to intervene and the subsequent \r\nquestioning of United Nations-led missions.\r\nLet us consider the following events. Since March \r\n2011, the conflict in Syria has already caused more than \r\n200,000 deaths and injured hundreds of thousands. It \r\nhas forced millions of people to f lee their homes and \r\ntheir countries to escape a war that shows infinite forms \r\nof cruelty and ferocity. The Republic of San Marino \r\nhas strongly condemned and continues to condemn \r\nthe violations of human rights and of international \r\nhumanitarian law committed in Syria by all parties to \r\nthe conflict, without exception. The recent resurgence \r\nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has of late claimed \r\nthe lives of more than 1,000 civilians, among whom \r\nwere many women and children, for the most part \r\nPalestinian, including those who had sought refuge in \r\nUnited Nations schools. The San Marino Government \r\nand Parliament have appealed to both sides to let their \r\nguns fall silent and the desire for dialogue prevail, \r\n42/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\naware that dialogue is the only way to achieve a peaceful \r\ncoexistence of the two peoples.\r\nThe situation is very serious in Iraq, where \r\nongoing ethnic and religious cleansing is taking place \r\nwith unprecedented violence. In the name of religion, \r\nsystematic and massive human rights violations, \r\nonly partially documented and evidenced, are being \r\nperpetrated. Such violations constitute massive crimes \r\nagainst humanity. A coalition of States is undertaking a \r\njoint response. San Marino hopes that the interventions \r\nare coordinated under the auspices of the United \r\nNations. In particular, it greeted with satisfaction and \r\nco-sponsored resolution 2178 (2014) on foreign terrorist \r\nfighters, unanimously adopted by the Security Council \r\non 24 September, under the leadership of the United \r\nStates President, Barack Obama.\r\nThe war that is being fought in some parts of North \r\nAfrica is causing the migration of thousands of desperate \r\npeople leaving for Europe every day in the hope of \r\narriving safely — a migration that, unfortunately, \r\noften turns into tragedy. The Mediterranean continues \r\nto witness the deaths of migrants from many areas \r\nof Africa and Asia. The information provided by the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is \r\nevidence — as if evidence were necessary — not only \r\nof the utter tragedy of the situation but also of the need \r\nfor a more united European action to address it.\r\nIn addition, this year has seen the crisis in Ukraine, \r\nwhich is a serious threat to the peace and security of \r\nthe entire European continent, owing to both the large \r\nnumber of victims and also the fact that fundamental \r\nprinciples, such as the territorial sovereignty and self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, are called into question.\r\nThese events demand the presence of the United \r\nNations and call for the entire international community \r\nto assume its responsibility and to restore the \r\nOrganization’s capacity to intervene in order to protect \r\nthe citizens of the entire world through the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes between States, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and in numerous General \r\nAssembly resolutions. These events also underscore \r\nthe need for a reaffirmation of our Organization’s \r\nprofoundly democratic nature so that each State, large \r\nor small, can make its voice heard and contribute to \r\nthe work and resolutions of the United Nations. These \r\nevents require that the cultural and religious diversity \r\nand the manifold traditions represented within our \r\nOrganization do not hamper the pursuit of possible \r\nsolutions. On the contrary, they should be a valuable \r\nresource, enabling us to adopt an approach that unites \r\nthe interests of the entire international community.\r\nWe recognize the duty and the responsibility to \r\nwork tirelessly for the definition and the implementation \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda. However, given \r\nthe seriousness of the international situation, a simple \r\nappeal will not suffice. On the contrary, precisely \r\nbecause, in many cases, a lack of integration between \r\nthe economic and the social and environmental aspects \r\nhas hampered the full achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, as the report notes, we are \r\nconvinced that we need new momentum and a new \r\nbeginning in order to restore elements able to promote \r\na culture of life, tolerance, acceptance and solidarity \r\nwithin our communities and populations. The first \r\nelement of that process, aimed at building a culture of \r\ninclusion, is the family. Recognition of the urgency to \r\ncreate such a culture demands of all States a common \r\ncommitment and renewed consideration to promote \r\nthe protection and support of the family. Indeed, the \r\nfamily is clearly the place where our main relationships \r\ngoverning human coexistence are developed. For that \r\nreason, weakening and marginalizing the family has \r\noften caused great existential confusion in younger \r\ngenerations with many serious personal and social \r\nconsequences.\r\nIn this spirit and with the utmost determination, \r\neach State must assume its responsibility and leave no \r\nstone unturned in resolving the numerous conflicts, \r\nwhich Pope Francis has referred to as the third world \r\nwar, since, if they were to prevail, they would nullify the \r\nplan for balanced development in the third millennium, \r\nas it should be defined in the United Nations agenda. \r\nSan Marino is a small State that has in its century-old \r\nhistory always considered freedom and peace as the \r\nsupreme goods to be preserved and protected. Based \r\non that identity, it is honoured and proud to contribute \r\nto the community of the United Nations. With humility \r\nwe call on all States to make every effort to give the \r\nUnited Nations strength and authority as the central \r\nreferral body we so keenly need today.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Highness Sheikh \r\nAbdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the United Arab Emirates.\r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan (United \r\nArab Emirates) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, let me \r\nsay that it is my pleasure to join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am \r\n14-55126 43/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nconfident that your experience in international affairs \r\nwill contribute to the success of the current session. \r\nWe stand ready to offer our full support during your \r\npresidency. I would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto commend your predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for his \r\nwise leadership of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session. I also would like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and United Nations staff around \r\nthe world for their continued efforts to promote global \r\npeace and security and to achieve development and \r\nwell-being for all people.\r\nWe meet today, as we do each year, to renew \r\nour commitment to the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the basis on which \r\nthe Organization was founded, and to reiterate our \r\nfirm belief in its objectives, including creating a \r\npeaceful and secure world and achieving prosperity \r\nand development for all peoples. We believe that those \r\nnoble objectives can be achieved by doing two things. \r\nThe first is playing an effective and responsible role in \r\nregional and international issues through constructive \r\ndialogue, positive engagement and the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes. The second is by creating a \r\nsuitable environment for international relations, based \r\non the principles of good-neighbourliness, moderation, \r\ntolerance and non-violence.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is gravely concerned about \r\ncurrent forms of extremism, terrorism and sectarian \r\ndivisions in our region, which have become a grave \r\nthreat to international peace and security. In addition to \r\nbeing a violation of human rights, terrorism threatens \r\nthe integrity and values of States, undermines their \r\nsocial fabric, disrupts their security and development, \r\nand erodes their cultural and human heritage. The acts of \r\nterrorist organizations — indiscriminate killings, mass \r\nexecutions, kidnappings and intimidation of innocent \r\nwomen and children — are heinous criminal acts and \r\nare strongly condemned by the United Arab Emirates. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates also denounces the brutal \r\nmethods used by such groups in the name of Islam, as \r\nIslam rejects such crimes, which are inconsistent with \r\nIslam’s moderate approach and principles of peaceful \r\ncoexistence among all peoples.\r\nAs the international community must be aware, \r\nbesides the increased incidence of terrorist and \r\nextremist acts in our region, most notably those \r\nperpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS), the threats posed by those terrorist and extremist \r\ngroups are expanding beyond our region to threaten \r\nthe rest of the civilized world. Various countries in \r\nthe region, including Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, \r\nIraq, Syria, Libya and the States of the African Sahel, \r\nare suffering at the hands of terrorist takfiri groups, \r\nwhich have exploited unstable conditions in those \r\ncountries to create an environment that they believe \r\nwill guarantee them steady funding, logistical support, \r\ntraining and recruitment. Those extremist and terrorist \r\norganizations promote obscurantism, exclusivity and \r\nan illicit ideology, and they perpetrate brutal acts to \r\nimpose their control and increase their influence in \r\norder to achieve their goals. The current collective \r\naction against the threat of ISIS and other terrorist \r\ngroups reflects the international community’s shared \r\nconviction of the need to confront the imminent danger. \r\nCivilized communities have no other option than to \r\nstamp out that threat. It is a test in which we must \r\nsucceed.\r\nWith regard to Libya, the United Arab Emirates is \r\nconcerned about the deteriorating security conditions \r\nand their repercussions on the stability of neighbouring \r\ncountries. We strongly oppose the terrorist acts that \r\nhave undermined the work of legitimately elected \r\ninstitutions in Libya. The United Arab Emirates’s policy \r\ntowards Libya is to provide full and unconditional \r\nsupport for the legitimate decisions taken by the \r\nLibyan people through their nationally elected House \r\nof Representatives.\r\nThe latest developments in our brother country, \r\nIraq, are increasingly alarming. ISIS has exploited \r\nthe sectarian practices of the former Government in \r\nIraq to garner the support of affected communities \r\nin expanding their influence over large parts of the \r\ncountry with extreme brutality. While the terrorist \r\ngroups are threatening the sovereignty of Iraq and its \r\nsocial, cultural and religious fabric, they continue to \r\nexploit the chaos in Syria to achieve their purposes \r\nwithout any regard for sovereignty or national borders.\r\nIn that context, the United Arab Emirates believes \r\nthat the current collective action will address the \r\ngrowing threat of extremist fighters in Syria as well as \r\nin Iraq. In that regard, I welcome the recent decision \r\nof the Security Council to confront and block the \r\nextremist groups. The threat posed by extremist \r\nfighters has increased in the midst of the violence \r\ninflicted by the Syrian regime on the Syrian people. \r\nAt this critical juncture, we must support the moderate \r\nSyrian opposition as part of an effective strategy to \r\ncounter extremism and terrorism.\r\n44/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nFrom this platform, we express our deep concern \r\nat the grave developments taking place in Yemen. The \r\nHouthis, who are using violence to try to undermine \r\nthe political process and the constitutional legitimacy \r\nof the Yemeni State, compel us to take a firm and \r\nimmediate stand against attempts to change the reality \r\nthrough violence and force. We have to realize that an \r\nexclusively sectarian and individualistic approach is \r\nnot an acceptable option to the Yemeni people, who \r\naspire to build an inclusive civil State that is capable \r\nof committing to a national dialogue and continuing \r\nthe implementation of the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\ninitiative and its mechanisms. The United Arab Emirates \r\nwill continue to support the political transition process \r\nin Yemen and will assist the efforts of the Yemeni State \r\nto achieve stability and development.\r\nIn the light of the recent developments in the region, \r\nit is incumbent on us, as nations that have pledged \r\nto abide by the principles enshrined in the Charter, \r\nto focus our efforts on combating that dangerous \r\nscourge. The United Arab Emirates therefore calls \r\non the international community and Member States \r\nto cooperate in combating terrorist groups and to \r\ntake comprehensive measures to fight them through \r\na clear, unified strategy. Those efforts should not \r\nbe limited to Iraq and Syria alone, but must also be \r\ndirected against the locations of those groups wherever \r\nthey exist. We wish also to stress the futility of taking \r\ngradual measures to address those challenges. We must \r\nintensify our efforts in order to combat the terrorist \r\ngroups promptly and effectively.\r\nWhile our attention should be fully focused on \r\ncountering terrorism, the United Arab Emirates \r\nbelieves that providing support to Governments facing \r\nserious security challenges is of critical importance. \r\nActive participation is also required to provide the \r\nnecessary assistance to restore peace and security in \r\nthose countries by helping them to strengthen their \r\nlegitimate institutions. In that context, we continue to \r\nhighlight the importance of respecting the sovereignty \r\nand independence of States and supporting all political \r\nefforts aimed at achieving peaceful settlements of \r\nongoing conflicts and disputes. Without those efforts, \r\nviolence will continue. The United Arab Emirates hopes \r\nto see security and stability prevail in and throughout \r\nall countries.\r\nI once again reiterate the firm position of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates in rejection of terrorism and \r\nextremism in all their forms. My country is fulfilling \r\nits responsibilities and is committed to participating \r\nconstructively at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels to combat violent extremism and affiliated \r\nbeliefs and terrorist acts. The United Arab Emirates, \r\nthrough its membership in the Global Counterterrorism \r\nForum, cooperates with international organizations and \r\nwith concerned countries to ensure that the territories \r\nof the latter are not exploited by those who facilitate or \r\nexecute terrorist acts, as well as other related crimes, \r\nsuch as the financing of terrorism, human trafficking \r\nand the recruitment of people to commit those egregious \r\ncrimes. By hosting the Hedayah Centre for training, \r\ndialogue and research to combat violent extremism, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates continues to support the \r\ninternational community in building capacities and \r\nexchanging best practices on that issue.\r\nMy country also continues to develop its national \r\npolicies and its legislative and executive systems in \r\norder to deter and confront all terrorist acts, eradicate \r\nthe roots of terrorism and protect our youth from being \r\nlured into a cycle of extremism and violence. To that end, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates recently adopted a federal law \r\non combating terrorist crimes. The law provides strict \r\npenalties for those found guilty of inciting terrorism or \r\ncommitting terrorist acts. The United Arab Emirates is \r\nalso strengthening preventive policies by establishing \r\ncentres for the rehabilitation of people influenced by \r\nextremist and terrorist ideologies.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates hopes for the recovery \r\nand restoration of security and stability in the region \r\nso that Governments can carry out their duties and \r\nobligations and their peoples can resume their normal \r\nlives in a constructive way. That hope is driven by the \r\nremarkable progress achieved by the new Government \r\nin Egypt and its good governance in implementing its \r\npolitical road map. Despite the challenges facing Egypt, \r\nthe signs of normalcy in public life and the revived \r\neconomy and culture are promising. Therefore, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates regrets the statements of some \r\nrepresentatives and their unacceptable questioning of \r\nthe legitimacy of the Egyptian Government.\r\nThe present Egyptian Government was freely \r\nelected by the Egyptian people, who believe in its ability \r\nto fulfil their aspirations. Questioning the Egyptian \r\npeople’s will and right to choose their representatives \r\nis an interference in the internal affairs of Egypt and \r\nundermines its stability. Accordingly, I emphasize that \r\nthe stability of our region depends on the stability of \r\nEgypt.\r\n14-55126 45/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nThe United Arab Emirates therefore calls on the \r\ninternational community to provide the necessary \r\nsupport to the Egyptian Government and its economy \r\nin order to boost Egypt’s efforts to achieve progress and \r\nprosperity. I would also like to commend the generous \r\ninitiative of the King of Saudi Arabia, Custodian of the \r\nTwo Holy Mosques, in convening the economic summit \r\nto support the Egyptian economy. His is a visionary \r\napproach to promoting Egypt’s future and maintaining \r\nmoderation in the region.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates expresses its \r\ndisappointment over the failure of the peace negotiations \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel. We strongly condemn \r\nIsrael’s aggression against Gaza, especially the \r\ndestruction directed against the civilian population and \r\ninfrastructure, including some United Nations facilities. \r\nWe demand a thorough, transparent and independent \r\ninvestigation to determine legal responsibility for the \r\ndamage. We hope that the continued failure of the peace \r\nnegotiations will not lead to a resurgence of violence \r\nand the return to the region of a new and more brutal \r\nform of terrorism.\r\nThe establishment of peace and security in the \r\nregion is a key element in achieving global stability \r\nand a priority of our foreign policy, which derives \r\nits principles from the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the provisions of international law. On the basis \r\nof those principles, my Government again rejects the \r\ncontinuing Iranian occupation of three islands that \r\nbelong to the United Arab Emirates — Greater Tunb, \r\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa. We demand restoration \r\nof the full sovereignty of the United Arab Emirates \r\nover the islands and emphasize that all actions and \r\nmeasures taken by the Iranian authorities are contrary \r\nto international law and custom and to all our common \r\nhuman values. In that respect, we note that the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran has recently hoisted the Iranian \r\nf lag on the part of Abu Musa island allocated to the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates under the 1971 memorandum of \r\nunderstanding, in violation of the memorandum. My \r\ncountry strongly condemns that action as a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the memorandum of understanding and \r\nregards it as devoid of any legal effect.\r\nWe therefore renew our call to the international \r\ncommunity to prevail on Iran to respond to the repeated \r\npeaceful, sincere calls of the United Arab Emirates for \r\na just settlement of the issue, either through direct, \r\nformal negotiations between the two countries, or by \r\nreferral to the International Court of Justice to finally \r\nsettle the dispute in accordance with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nprovisions of international law.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the ongoing \r\nnegotiations between the five permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council and the Islamic Republic of Iran aimed \r\nat reaching a comprehensive settlement concerning the \r\nIranian nuclear programme. We affirm that, in order \r\nto avert an arms race in the region, a final and strict \r\nagreement must be achieved; the region cannot afford \r\nfurther tension and instability. Nevertheless, the United \r\nArab Emirates believes that the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy is a necessity in meeting the world’s growing \r\nenergy demands. My country is proud to be a pioneer in \r\nthis field and to successfully harness the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear technology in compliance with the highest \r\nstandards of transparency, safety and security.\r\nDespite the challenges facing the region, my \r\ncountry has always sought to remain a model of \r\nmoderation, tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the \r\nregion, consistent with current international efforts. We \r\nstrongly believe that investment in human development \r\nis important in the long term, and we therefore attach \r\ngreat importance to the negotiations on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and the sustainable development \r\ngoals. We welcome the results of those consultations, \r\nwhich have placed the eradication of poverty at the \r\nheart of the development agenda.\r\nMy country also supports the inclusion of goals \r\nthat would provide sustainable energy for all, develop \r\ngreen economies, promote food security, supply \r\nsafe drinking water and ensure gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment. The United Arab Emirates is \r\ncommitted to pursuing economic and social policies \r\naimed primarily at achieving the development of the \r\nindividual, providing all means necessary for a person \r\nto lead a decent and productive life, and promoting \r\nprosperity. In that context, I note that Dubai has been \r\nchosen as the venue of the 2020 World Expo. It is a \r\ngreat honour for us to act as host to this event, and we \r\nthank all the countries that supported our candidacy. \r\nWe look forward to working with Member States to \r\norganize an exhibition that meets the aspirations of all.\r\nComprehensive and sustainable development \r\ncannot be achieved unless all segments of society \r\nparticipate in the national development process. \r\nAccordingly, the United Arab Emirates pays special \r\nattention to women’s empowerment. My country now \r\noccupies a prominent place among the countries of the \r\n46/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nworld in terms of women’s achievements and success \r\nin all areas of life. Our efforts are not limited solely to \r\nempowering women in the United Arab Emirates, but \r\nalso include supporting women throughout the region \r\nand around the world.\r\nAbu Dhabi will host a UN-Women Liaison Office \r\nwith the support and leadership of Her Highness \r\nSheikha Fatima bint Mubarak. We are also assisting \r\nUN-Women in the preparations for the high-level \r\nreview on women, peace, and security. Those efforts \r\nreflect the interest and participation of the United Arab \r\nEmirates in international efforts to empower women \r\nas effective partners and agents in preventing war and \r\nresolving conflict, keeping in mind that women play a \r\nkey role in countering violence and promoting peace \r\nand security throughout the world.\r\nWe must continue to devote special attention \r\nto the issue of climate change. Recent international \r\nreports indicate that the effects of climate change have \r\nbecome a major challenge to development. But there \r\nis still some time left to mitigate the impact through \r\ninternational cooperation. In that context, we welcome \r\nthe outcome of the recent Climate Summit held a \r\nfew days ago at the United Nations. We are grateful \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to \r\nadvance that important issue prior to the start of the \r\ngeneral debate of the General Assembly, and we thank \r\nall the participating parties. We also urge all parties \r\nto abide by the agreements reached and stress that the \r\ndeveloped countries must take the lead in that respect.\r\nThe efforts of the United Arab Emirates in the field \r\nof renewable energy are seen in various parts of the \r\nworld. We host the International Renewable Energy \r\nAgency in Abu Dhabi and make available more than \r\n$500 million in the form of grants and low-interest loans \r\nfor renewable energy projects in developing countries. \r\nWe also have extensive and varied international \r\ncommercial investments totalling billions of dollars \r\nin the renewable-energy sector. Such initiatives, \r\ninvestments and grants all contribute to addressing \r\nclimate change and its impact throughout the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore that the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates will continue to make every \r\neffort to achieve our aspiration to contribute to a secure \r\nand stable world, in which people can live in dignity, \r\npeace and happiness.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe live in a globalized world that is moving towards \r\nmultipolarity in an age characterized by the threat to \r\nthe survival of the human species. The United States \r\nGovernment and NATO will not be able to reverse that \r\ntrend with a new world division through the force of \r\narms. However, there is a serious risk that in trying to \r\ndo so, they render the world ungovernable.\r\nThe huge nuclear and conventional arsenals \r\nthat have been built up, the imposed annual military \r\nexpenditure that amounts to $1.75 trillion and the \r\nincrease in military budgets to 2 per cent of the gross \r\ndomestic product required of all States members of \r\nNATO will not help to address or to resolve issues such \r\nas poverty, hunger, epidemics or waves of migration or \r\nto overcome the global economic, environmental. food, \r\nenergy and water crises.\r\nAs has already been demonstrated, wherever the \r\nso-called unconventional warfare described in the 2010 \r\nUnited States Special Forces Army Training Circular \r\n18-01 and the innovations of the 2010 United States \r\nQuadrennial Defense Review are practised, chaos \r\nensues through the destabilization or destruction \r\nof States, the proliferation of violent and extremist \r\ngroups and the tearing apart of nations, cultures and \r\nreligions, thereby seriously jeopardizing regional and \r\ninternational peace and security. It is necessary to \r\ncondemn the militarization of cyberspace and the illegal \r\nand covert interference in the information systems \r\nof some countries in order to use them in aggressive \r\nactions against third countries to stir up conflict, as \r\nwell as global espionage on Governments and entire \r\nsocieties.\r\nThe extraterritorial application of United States \r\nlaws to the detriment of other sovereign nations is \r\nbecoming increasingly aggressive and encourages \r\nthe use of unilateral sanctions, in particular financial \r\nsanctions, as a tool of foreign policy. The use of its \r\ncourts of justice to impose multimillion-dollar fines, \r\nincluding on its allies, under decisions that violate \r\ninternational law, has become a means of punishment \r\nand threat and a way to spuriously obtain financial \r\nresources. Governments, by failing to defend their own \r\nsovereignty and to apply their own laws so as to protect \r\nthe standards of the international financial system and \r\n14-55126 47/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nthe legitimate interests of their nations and those of their \r\ncompanies and citizens, are creating the conditions \r\nnecessary for the proliferation of such practices, which \r\njeopardize the independence of all States and the rule \r\nof international law.\r\nMedia empires, increasingly linked to the \r\nhegemonic goals of the Western Powers, continue their \r\nmisinformation campaigns, shamelessly and cynically \r\nmanipulate facts and create public opinion matrices \r\nthat promote aggression. We need another international \r\norder, where there is no room for the philosophy of war \r\nand the plundering of natural resources.\r\nThe foreign intervention in Syria must stop. It is \r\ninconceivable that Western Powers encourage, finance \r\nand arm terrorist groups to set them against a State, \r\nwhile trying to combat their crimes in another State, as \r\nis now happening in Iraq. The United States Government \r\nviolates international law when it launches, in contempt \r\nof the United Nations, unilateral bombings without \r\nrespect for sovereign borders or States under the guise \r\nof dubious coalitions.\r\nThe attempt to deploy NATO up to Russia’s borders \r\nwill have serious consequences for international peace \r\nand security and for the stability of Europe. The \r\nsanctions against Russia are immoral and unjust. The \r\nstrategic American deployment in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion will create dangers for the sovereignty of all \r\nnations in the area.\r\nIsrael’s crimes against the Palestinian people, \r\nmost recently in the Gaza Strip, should not remain \r\nunpunished under the protection of a veto in the \r\nSecurity Council. Palestine should already be a State \r\nMember of the United Nations, established within the \r\n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe General Assembly must exercise the \r\nprerogatives conferred on it by the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations in the current dangerous and unstable \r\ninternational situation, which is full of threats and \r\nchallenges. The Security Council should be rebuilt \r\non the basis of democracy, transparency and the fair \r\nrepresentation of the countries of the South, which are \r\ndiscriminated against, as permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers. It should be built on credibility and strict \r\nobservance of the Charter, without double standards, \r\nobscure procedures or the anachronistic veto. The \r\nOrganization needs profound reform and the defence \r\nof its principles. The Secretary-General should be the \r\ndefender and guarantor of international peace.\r\nThe 1.2 billion people who live in extreme poverty, \r\nthe 842 million people who suffer chronic hunger, \r\nthe 774 million illiterate adults and the 57 million \r\nuneducated children affirm that the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals — which are questionable from \r\na methodological point of view — were a mirage. \r\nThere has been and still is a lack of political will in \r\nthe Governments of industrialized States, where \r\nblindness and ineffective selfishness prevail. Insatiable \r\ntransnational businesses increasingly focus on the \r\nownership of huge resources. The unequal distribution \r\nof wealth is increasingly ruthless.\r\nIt is necessary, inevitably, to establish a new \r\ninternational economic order. In these circumstances, \r\nthe discussions on the post-2015 development agenda \r\ngive us little reason to hope. However, we must try \r\nto reach agreement, as that is the most urgent task. It \r\nmust be the result of an inclusive intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation. The resulting document should not be the \r\ninterpretation of a few parties to the consensus, but \r\nrather of the consensus itself.\r\nIt is urgent to make sub-Saharan Africa a priority. \r\nIt is essential to confront jointly and decisively, with \r\nsufficient and genuine cooperation, the Ebola epidemic \r\nthat is affecting some countries of the continent. Cuba \r\nhas decided to maintain its medical cooperation in the \r\n32 African countries where more than 4,000 specialists \r\nare working and is willing to extend its cooperation, \r\nunder the auspices of the World Health Organization \r\n(WHO), to other, most affected countries, as has been \r\nreported. Our doctors and paramedics will do so \r\ncompletely voluntarily.\r\nWe call on the international community, particularly \r\nindustrialized countries with substantial means, to \r\nforcefully respond to the call of the United Nations \r\nand WHO to supply financial, health and scientific \r\nresources right away in order to eradicate the scourge \r\nand prevent it from claiming more lives. The necessary \r\nresources should also be contributed to support the \r\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063, which sets forth the road \r\nmap for the development of the region.\r\nIn the past five decades, 325,000 Cuban health \r\nworkers have assisted 158 nations of the South, including \r\n39 African countries, where 76,000 have worked. Also, \r\n38,000 physicians were trained free of charge in 121 \r\ncountries; of those, 3,392 were in 45 African nations. \r\nIf Cuba, small and subject to a blockade, has been able \r\nto do that, how much more could have been done for \r\n48/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\nAfrica with the cooperation of all, especially of the \r\nrichest States?\r\nAt the second Summit of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), in \r\nHavana, we agreed on what is needed to achieve the \r\ngoal of making societies more just and inclusive. It \r\nis indispensable that there be a better distribution of \r\nwealth and income, the eradication of illiteracy, quality \r\neducation for all, real food security, health systems \r\nwith universal coverage, and the fulfilment of other \r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe solemn Proclamation of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean as a zone of peace, signed by the Heads \r\nof State and Government, enshrines respect for the \r\nprinciples and norms of international law, the promotion \r\nof a culture of peace, nuclear disarmament and general \r\nand complete disarmament, and the inalienable right of \r\nevery State to choose its political, economic and social \r\nsystem. We also undertook to make Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean a region free from colonialism and \r\nexpressed support for the inalienable right of the people \r\nof Puerto Rico to self-determination and independence.\r\nThe Havana summit recognized that the current \r\neconomic, financial and environmental crises have \r\ndelivered particularly harsh blows to small island \r\ndeveloping States, including the nations of the \r\nCaribbean. Their efforts to improve the welfare of \r\ntheir populations should not be punished by calling \r\nthem middle-income countries through schematic \r\ncalculations of per capita income, without taking into \r\naccount their specificities and vulnerabilities.\r\nIn CELAC, the region of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean has found a native and legitimate space \r\nto forge from its rich diversity the essential unity to \r\nfulfil the dreams of our heroes, achieve the complete \r\nindependence of “Our America”  and make a substantial \r\ncontribution to creating balance in the world. In that \r\neffort, there have been significant developments — the \r\nmeeting between the Union of South American Nations \r\nand Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and \r\nSouth Africa (BRICS); the meeting between the \r\nleaders of China and the countries of Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean; and the establishment of the China-\r\nCELAC Forum in Brasilia in July, as had been agreed \r\nin Havana. We welcome the Fortaleza Declaration, \r\nalso adopted in July in Brazil, at the sixth summit of \r\nthe BRICS countries — whose economies account for \r\n25 per cent of world gross domestic product and almost \r\n40 per cent of the population of the planet — as well \r\nas the setting up of a development bank and a foreign \r\nexchange reserves common fund, which are important \r\nfor the countries of the South and for the construction \r\nof a new international financial architecture.\r\nWe express our solidarity with the Bolivarian \r\nand Chavista revolution, which, under the leadership \r\nof President Nicolas Maduro, is battling to fend off \r\ndestabilizing actions and foreign interference. We \r\nsupport the worthy fight being waged by Argentina \r\nagainst speculative capital funds, and we oppose the \r\ninterventionist decisions of the United States courts \r\nthat are violating international law. In addition, we \r\nreiterate our strong support for the legitimate rights \r\nof Argentina with respect to the Malvinas Islands. We \r\nalso reiterate our unwavering support for the fight that \r\nEcuador is leading against the ecological pillaging \r\nand damage caused by the activities of transnational \r\ncompanies.\r\nOn the eve of the International Decade for People \r\nof African Descent (2015-2024), we would recall that \r\nthis year we celebrate the 210th anniversary of the \r\nindependence of Haiti, whose anti-slavery and pro-\r\nindependence revolution was the precursor of liberation \r\nmovements in Latin America and the Caribbean. Haiti \r\ndeserves special contributions for its reconstruction \r\nand development, under the sovereign leadership of its \r\nGovernment, in which we encourage the international \r\ncommunity to participate. We support the claim of the \r\nCaribbean to receive reparations from the colonial \r\nPowers for the horrors of slavery.\r\nThe State Department has again put Cuba on \r\nits unilateral and arbitrary list of State sponsors of \r\ninternational terrorism. Its real purpose is to increase \r\nscrutiny of our international financial transactions \r\nworldwide and justify the policy of blockade. During \r\nthe current Administration, there has been a tightening \r\nof the extraterritorial dimension of the blockade, with \r\na strong and unprecedented emphasis in the financial \r\nrealm, through the imposition of huge fines on banking \r\ninstitutions in third-party countries. An example of this \r\nis the scandalous and unjust mega-fine imposed on the \r\nFrench bank BNP Paribas. Furthermore, the current \r\nAdministration has not stepped back from promoting \r\ndestabilization in Cuba. It allocates millions of dollars \r\nto that end in its budget every year and increasingly \r\nrelies on undercover methods, such as the use of \r\ninformation and communications technology. The \r\nZunZuneo project, sponsored by the United States \r\nAgency for International Development (USAID), which \r\n14-55126 49/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nnot only violates Cuban law but also the law of its own \r\ncountry, is the latest evidence of that.\r\nRecent disclosures about the use of young people \r\nfrom our continent in subversive actions in Cuba, \r\na project funded and executed by USAID, confirm \r\nthat the Cuban Government is right in its countless \r\ndenunciations of the ongoing illegal plans of the \r\nUnited States to subvert Cuba’s internal order, in \r\nviolation of Cuban sovereignty, the sovereignty of \r\nthird countries and international law. We cannot fail \r\nto remember that this month marks the sixteenth year \r\nof the unjust imprisonment of three Cubans from the \r\nCuban Five — Gerardo, Ramón and Antonio — who \r\nwith the utmost altruism confronted the terrorist plans \r\norganized within United States territory against our \r\ncountry. I therefore reiterate, on behalf of the people \r\nand Government of Cuba, that we will not cease in our \r\nefforts to call for their return to their homeland.\r\nCuba, for its part, remains calm and prepared for \r\nmutually respectful and responsible dialogue, based \r\non reciprocity, with the United States Government. \r\nAt the same time, Cuba continues to make progress \r\nin the updating of its socioeconomic model, despite \r\nadverse international circumstances marked by a global \r\neconomic crisis and the tightening of the blockade.\r\nMs. Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nUpdating Cuban’s economic socialist model is \r\naimed at ensuring well-being, equity and social justice \r\nfor all Cubans. The changes that we are introducing \r\nare also geared to preserving the achievements of the \r\nRevolution, which so many generations have fought for. \r\nThe goal is to build an ever more just, prosperous and \r\nsustainable Cuban socialism.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sebastian Kurz, Federal Minister for \r\nEurope, Integration and Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Austria.\r\nMr. Kurz (Austria): It is with great respect that \r\nI stand at this rostrum for the first time as Austrian \r\nForeign Minister. Many eminent world leaders have \r\nstood here before me and laid out their visions on \r\ninternational challenges and crises. As many may be \r\nable to tell, probably even from the last row, I look a bit \r\nyounger than most of the speakers before me. Indeed, \r\nI believe I am the only person under the age of 30 who \r\nhas the privilege of speaking here this week. So while \r\nI cannot speak from many years of experience, what I \r\ncan offer is the perspective of a young generation.\r\nMy generation is the post-Cold War generation. \r\nThe Iron Curtain collapsed 25 years ago, when I was 3 \r\nyears old. For us in Europe, the years after the collapse \r\nof the Iron Curtain were years filled with hope and new \r\nopportunities. We could travel freely, study in foreign \r\ncountries and meet people from all over the world. \r\nWe grew up in a society where human rights were \r\nrespected, where the rule of law was a given, and where \r\nreligious freedom was practised. We communicate \r\nwithout borders on Facebook and Twitter, we have our \r\nentire lives stored on our smartphone, and we consume \r\nthe news online.\r\nWhile the world after the Cold War offered \r\nfascinating new opportunities, it also proved to be not \r\norderly at all, but quite messy and more uncertain than \r\nmany had predicted. Just two years after the Berlin Wall \r\ncame down, war returned to Europe in the Western \r\nBalkan countries. Thankfully, the horrors came to an \r\nend, and these countries now have a clear European \r\nperspective. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, we \r\nbelieved that the world would move forward and that \r\nmore and more people would benefit from the same \r\nopportunities that my generation in Western Europe \r\nenjoyed. But the world today seems to be shifting \r\ninto reverse. We are facing situations and horrors we \r\nthought we had overcome many years ago. For young \r\npeople like myself, who learned about the Cold War \r\nonly through history books, it seems unbelievable that \r\nthe thinking in terms of confrontational blocs could \r\nreturn to Europe.\r\nThe crisis in Ukraine is probably the most serious \r\nchallenge to peace and security Europe has had to face \r\nin decades. In retrospect, it is easy to claim that this \r\ndevelopment should have been predictable, and that we \r\nshould have foreseen it. But let us be honest. Who would \r\nhave predicted that, after three years of negotiations, \r\nPresident Yanukovych would refuse to sign the \r\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union? Who \r\nwould have predicted that the Maidan movement would \r\nbe strong enough to force him to leave the country? \r\nAnd who would have predicted that Russia would react \r\nby annexing Crimea and would even actively support \r\nseparatist movements?\r\nWe cannot accept that international law should \r\nbe violated and that recognized borders challenged in \r\nEurope once again. At the same time, we need to find \r\n50/51 14-55126\r\nA/69/PV.15 27/09/2014\r\na political solution that goes beyond a mere ceasefire. \r\nWe need a solution that offers the prospect of a free, \r\nstable and united Ukraine, a Ukraine which enjoys \r\nstrong economic ties with both the European Union \r\nand the Russian Federation. Let us not return to Cold \r\nWar thinking, where two blocs face each other. Our \r\npolitical guideline must be to move from a policy of \r\n“either Europe or Russia” to a logic of “both Europe \r\nand Russia”.\r\nSome people have claimed that Ukraine would \r\nnot be in this situation had it not given up its nuclear \r\nweapons. This kind of thinking is dangerous. And we \r\nhave to ask ourselves, where would this lead us? As \r\nlong as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use, on \r\npurpose or by accident, remains real. Let us be clear: \r\nthe use of nuclear weapons, more than any other human \r\naction, has the potential to end life on this planet. And, \r\n69 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, let us not \r\nforget that the humanitarian consequences of a single \r\nnuclear explosion are terrifying and long-lasting. The \r\ndesire to prevent the humanitarian consequences of \r\nnuclear weapons should unite us all. We therefore hope \r\nthat the Conference on the Humanitarian Impact of \r\nNuclear Weapons in Vienna in December will mark a \r\nreal change of direction in international discussions on \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nLooking beyond our region, we are currently \r\nwitnessing a further rise of extremism in the name of \r\nreligion, and a new development — foreign terrorist \r\nfighters who come from Western countries and travel \r\nto the Middle East in order to join the fight. There \r\nis no time to lose; we must actively address what is \r\nhappening in northern Iraq, where the so-called Islamic \r\nState of Iraq and the Levant is attempting to wipe out \r\nentire religious communities, where children are being \r\nbeheaded, mothers raped and fathers hanged because of \r\ntheir beliefs.\r\nIn Europe, we estimate that there are thousands of \r\nforeign fighters with European passports. In our case, \r\nthere are more than 140 people from Austria fighting \r\nin the name of a so-called holy war. We all know that \r\nthe terrorist organizations operate worldwide. They \r\nget their terrorist fighters by recruiting globally. They \r\nfinance themselves through global networks. They \r\nbuy arms and other resources on a global scale. And \r\nthey use, or rather abuse, the global communication \r\nnetworks to their benefit.\r\nHow is it possible that terrorist organizations have \r\naccess to financial and economic resources that allow \r\nthem to operate so effectively? How is it possible that \r\nwe allow terrorist organizations to abuse the right to \r\nfreedom of expression by showing their barbaric acts \r\non social media? And how is it possible that they are \r\nable to recruit new fighters within our societies?\r\nWe all, Governments and the private sector as well, \r\nhave a duty to develop preventive measures within our \r\nsocieties to stop the f low of foreign terrorist fighters, \r\nto cut off financial support to their organizations and \r\nto put an end to the abuse of social media networks \r\nby developing forms of voluntary self-restriction for \r\nthose networks. The adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2178 (2014) this week was an important first \r\nstep, but now we must implement it. And we should \r\nalways remind ourselves that the battle lines in this \r\nconfrontation are not limited to Iraq or Syria. They run \r\nthrough our own Western societies.\r\nMy generation in Austria was privileged to grow \r\nup in freedom from fear and from want. There are, of \r\ncourse, other stories to be told of young people growing \r\nup in Afghanistan or the Central African Republic, for \r\nexample. Today half of the world’s population is under \r\n25 years of age, and many of them lack adequate nutrition, \r\nhealth care, education and jobs. All in all, those are not \r\ngreat prospects for life. The work of the United Nations \r\non development is therefore crucial to lifting millions \r\nof people out of poverty, helping the hungry and the \r\nsick and educating new generations around the world. \r\nThe United Nations needs and deserves our support, \r\nand I can assure the Assembly that Austria fully stands \r\nbehind the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nBut we must also ensure that respect for human \r\nrights and the rule of law receive proper attention. Only \r\na society that respects the rights of its citizens can  enable \r\neach individual to develop his or her potential. We are \r\ntherefore very pleased to be organizing the Second \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, to be held in Vienna in November. And we \r\nare honoured that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \r\nagreed to attend the Conference.\r\nI am aware that the list of challenges that the \r\ninternational community and the United Nations are \r\nfacing is long: the situations in Iraq, Ukraine, Syria, \r\nGaza, the Central African Republic and Mali and the \r\noutbreak of the Ebola disease, to name just a few. In \r\nview of those challenges, the United Nations needs and \r\ndeserves our full support. I want to especially thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \r\nat the helm of the United Nations. I can assure him \r\n14-55126 51/51\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.15\r\nthat Austria remains committed to working actively \r\nwithin the United Nations and its bodies to support his \r\nwork and to address our global challenges, whether as \r\npeacekeepers, through our presidency of the Economic \r\nand Social Council or as a member of the Human \r\nRights Council. We are particularly proud to host the \r\nUnited Nations Office at Vienna, which has become \r\nan Austrian landmark. Austria has a long tradition of \r\nbuilding bridges and serving as a place for international \r\ndialogue. We will continue to do so in the future and to \r\noffer our contribution to making the world a little bit \r\nsafer and better for the generations to come.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3 p.m.\r\n"
