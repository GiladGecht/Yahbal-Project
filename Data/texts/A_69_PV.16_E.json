Those \r\ntwo armed conflicts caused humanity to open its eyes \r\nto a new reality: the old balances among European \r\nPowers no longer served to maintain peace in the \r\nworld. The policy of blocs was ineffectual in preventing \r\nconflicts with enormous destructive capacity. Further, \r\nthe foreign activities of countries, focusing solely and \r\nexclusively on their national interests, proved in some \r\ncases to be the cause of the conflicts.\r\nThe two World Wars raised humankind’s awareness \r\nin that the world needed a global order that would \r\nensure peace and security and promote development \r\nand justice. Those functions could no longer be \r\nprovided by a single country, however powerful and \r\nlarge, or even by a bloc of countries; rather, there had \r\nto be multilateral action. That was the raison d’être of \r\nthe United Nations, of which the highest expression is \r\nthis General Assembly.\r\nI wanted to begin with a brief historical reference, \r\nbecause I believe that the challenges of peace and \r\nsecurity in the world of today are not very different \r\nfrom the challenges of peace and security of the world \r\nof yesterday, of 1914 or 1944. Certainly there is a \r\nvariety of challenges, but they have a very significant \r\ncommon denominator: they can be resolved only with a \r\nvision that is global, multilateral, effective and, above \r\nall, respectful of the principles that inspire this General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe conflicts in Syria, Palestine or Ukraine, which \r\nthreaten peace and security and stability, will not be \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.16\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n16th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 27 September 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nresolved optimally or effectively with a partial or short-\r\nterm vision. Any solution that veers away from the \r\nfounding principles of the United Nations is condemned \r\nto be unstable, not lasting and, unfortunately, quite \r\noften a solution that leads to new conflicts.\r\nTherefore Andorra has always championed and will \r\ncontinue to champion the discussion of and solutions \r\nto those conflicts under United Nations auspices. We \r\ndid so when we co-sponsored the draft resolution in \r\nthe Security Council that would have requested that the \r\ncase of Syria be referred to the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), because without justice there can be no \r\nlasting peace — neither in Syria nor anywhere else.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAlso, in the same spirit we have been unflagging \r\nin our defence of a solution to the Palestinian conflict \r\nthat obtains peaceful coexistence for two States, in \r\ncompliance with United Nations resolutions. A solution \r\nmust be based on mutual recognition and mutual respect, \r\nbecause the aspirations of the Palestinian people to have \r\ntheir own State are noble and respectable, but also noble \r\nand respectable are the aspirations of the Government of \r\nIsrael to ensure life and security for its citizens. Along \r\nthe same lines, we do not believe that any solution to \r\nthe Ukrainian conflict can be stable unless it respects \r\nthe principles of international law and unless it comes \r\nas the fruit of a sincere dialogue — neither in Ukraine \r\nnor anywhere else.\r\nThe risk and threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity arising from the emergence of the Islamic \r\nState in Syria and Iraq require a clear response from \r\nthe international community vis-à-vis the extremists. \r\nThere can be no excuse or mitigating factor for the \r\ncriminal acts of barbarism, sectarianism and — let us \r\nbe clear — terrorism to which the Islamic State resorts \r\nas a strategy for its action and communication. There \r\ncan be no double-standard discourse. The Islamic State \r\nmurders innocent people in cold blood. We all feel as \r\nif we are British, American or French citizens when \r\nwatching the recent savage executions. We must also \r\nall feel as if we were Syrian or Iraqi citizens — true \r\nvictims of those extremists, though not always so \r\nvisible in the media. There can be no room for inaction \r\nor for impunity.\r\nNew threats, also global in nature, have appeared, \r\nsuch as the phenomenon of foreign combatants. In \r\nthat connection, Andorra co-sponsored the recent \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2178 (2014). We must have \r\na response to rechannel efforts to tackle the challenges \r\nand immediate threats. In the long run we must be able \r\nto persevere in the fight against sectarian discourse, \r\nextremist discourse, and discourses of hate. On that \r\npoint, education must play an essential role, together \r\nwith the other values of the United Nations, now and \r\nin the future.\r\nThe actions taken by my country in the United \r\nNations over the past year have focused primarily on \r\neducation. That matter requires, perhaps more than \r\nany other, a vision that integrates long-term thinking. \r\nPromoting access to quality education for all the \r\ncitizens of our planet has always been a priority of the \r\nUnited Nations, because when we speak of education \r\nwe are speaking also of fundamental rights and of \r\ndevelopment. But I would go further. Education is \r\nalso an instrument for creating awareness of a global \r\ncitizenry. If there is not a broad majority of citizens of \r\nthe world who believe in the principles and values of \r\nthe United Nations, our actions will always be in vain.\r\nI am convinced that the only way to create global \r\nawareness is through education. Education is the best \r\nweapon in the fight against hatred and violence of all \r\nkinds. Andorra therefore welcomes and has participated \r\nfrom the beginning in the Global Education First \r\nInitiative promoted by the Secretary-General, because \r\nit brings a universal vision together with local action. \r\nIt also shows that diversity is strengthened in a global \r\nfocus, and with diversity we can strengthen democracy.\r\nAndorrans, because of our historical and \r\ngeographical circumstances, have understood for some \r\ntime that education must have a twofold focus, local and \r\nglobal. We have also long understood that cooperation \r\namong the different States strengthens the quality of \r\nour educational systems and opens new opportunities \r\nfor our citizens. I say “educational systems” because \r\nthe citizens of Andorra can have access on an equal \r\nfooting, and without cost, to French, Spanish and \r\nAndorran education. Those three public education \r\nsystems are complemented by the offer in Andorra of a \r\nCatholic religious education, accessible also to a great \r\npart of our population.\r\nPerhaps without being fully aware of it, or perhaps \r\nbecause fortune has placed us between two great \r\nEuropean nations, it is true that for decades now we \r\nAndorrans have educated ourselves in diversity and \r\nin being multicultural. That has not caused us to lose \r\n14-55132 3/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nour identity; on the contrary, our identity has been \r\nreinforced. Sometimes we are not even aware ourselves \r\nof the educational richness of our country and of the \r\ngreat asset that that is. For that reason the Government \r\nof Andorra has focused a great deal of its policy and \r\naction abroad on education. In 2012 and 2013, during \r\nthe Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe, that \r\nis how we acted. It is also what we have shown through \r\nparticipating in the Global Education First Initiative, \r\ntogether with 15 other countries from all continents. \r\nThat was an honour for Andorra.\r\nThat activity abroad is also reflected coherently \r\nin internal policies in Andorra. We have suffered the \r\neffects of the international economic crisis for years. We \r\nhave had austerity in our public spending, but that has \r\nnot undermined our educational system. It will never \r\naffect our educational system, or undermine it, because \r\neducation is the best passport to the opportunity for a \r\nfuture that is better for all.\r\nThe need for multilateral action is clear not only \r\nin the matter of education but also, and perhaps even \r\nmore intensely, in the fight against global warming. \r\nWhat we each can do unilaterally will not accomplish \r\nmuch if there is no global commitment. It is in the fight \r\nagainst climate change that we can see most clearly that \r\nunilateral actions have a limited reach. Andorrans are \r\nvery aware of that, given that our primary economic \r\nsector is winter and mountain tourism — a tourism \r\nthreatened by global warming. The Pyrenees are \r\nheating up at 0.2°C each decade, and precipitation has \r\ndropped by 2 litres per square metre each year.\r\nIt is clear that a programme of local action is \r\nrequired. We are working, together with the population \r\nthrough education and awareness, on policies to reduce \r\nour impact on the environment. We are preparing \r\nstudies to seek ways to mitigate the effects of climate \r\nchange and also to seek alternative and complementary \r\nsystems. Over the years ahead, we will deploy great \r\nefforts to bring about alternative energy sources.\r\nBut all that is not enough, nor are the many \r\nactions being implemented by Governments in \r\ncountries represented enough. National domestic \r\nenvironmental policies are important, but if we are to \r\nlimit carbon dioxide emissions we must have a global \r\ncommitment. Without effective implementation of such \r\na commitment, the fight against climate change will not \r\nbear the hoped-for fruits. We have a year to prepare for \r\nthe Paris Conference, a year to mobilize our efforts.\r\nIt is also time for the international community \r\nto mobilize to fight the Ebola virus that so seriously \r\naffects Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. It also affects \r\nus; let us not deceive ourselves. It is the time to show \r\nsolidarity, to help. Now is the time, in the weeks and \r\nmonths ahead, when we must tackle that disease, \r\nwhich, unfortunately, does not recognize — nor will it \r\nrecognize — borders. It is urgent. Beyond that it is, in \r\nmy opinion, a global emergency.\r\nThree years ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Principality of Andorra came to this Assembly \r\nand spoke, among other things, of an ambitious reform \r\nprogramme for restructuring our economic model (see \r\nA/66/PV.27). The programme hinged on transparency, \r\neconomic openness and a homogenization that would \r\nrespect certain Andorran specifics. Today, three \r\nyears down the road, we can make a very satisfactory \r\nassessment of the implementation of that policy. Our \r\ncountry has implemented a fiscal model that works \r\nwith our European neighbours, a moderate system that \r\ntaxes all income and promotes economic productivity.\r\nWe have also opened 100 per cent of the Andorran \r\neconomy to foreign investment, as we believe that a \r\nmore open world is a more transparent world, one with \r\nmore opportunities for all, and in particular for those \r\nwho deserve it the most. A country such as ours, which \r\nfor many years has been open to immigration, cannot \r\ncontinue to allow our citizens to have different levels \r\nof rights economically. They must all have the same \r\neconomic rights. In that process we have broadened all \r\neconomic rights to all foreign residents, who represent \r\nmore than half of our population, because a more open \r\neconomy is also a fairer and more democratic society.\r\nAt the same time, along with its domestic reforms, \r\nAndorra has negotiated double-taxation agreements \r\nwith France and Luxembourg and is negotiating one \r\nwith Spain that I am convinced will be concluded soon. \r\nWe think we can have a similar agreement with other \r\nEuropean and other countries. Those agreements show \r\nthat there is a commitment in Andorra to a more open and \r\ntransparent global economy. That is a firm commitment \r\non the part of our Government with regard to generating \r\nmore opportunities for our business sector. We are also \r\nfirmly determined to move towards greater integration \r\nof our economy in the single European market. For us, \r\ngoing global begins in Europe.\r\nI wanted to sum up some of our principal \r\ndomestic reforms because I understand that a spirit \r\n4/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nof multilateralism and a global spirit must prevail. \r\nThe efforts of a country working for transparency and \r\neconomic cooperation make sense and will be effective \r\nonly if they are accompanied by equal efforts by all \r\ncountries — again, by all countries. Andorrans are \r\ncommitted to moving in that direction, and to do so \r\ntogether with the international community, because we \r\nknow that it is only thus, only by working globally, that \r\nprogress will be effective, equitable and stable.\r\nThe statement of the Head of Government of a \r\ncountry of 468 square kilometres and 70,000 inhabitants \r\nwill never make the headlines or be discussed in \r\nprime time on the world’s big international television \r\nchannels. But representing a small country gives us \r\nsome advantages, including one that I believe we \r\nshould underscore today. No one is as aware as we are \r\nof the importance of multilateral forums when it comes \r\nto resolving conflicts, strengthening international law \r\nand finding global solutions. No one is as aware as we \r\nare that to preserve individual identities and diversities \r\nwe must have a collective resolve and joint action.\r\nHistory has accustomed Andorrans to being affected \r\nby the geostrategic decisions of bigger countries and to \r\nsuffering indirectly the effects of instability occurring \r\nbeyond our borders. We know that in the great causes of \r\nhumanity such as the fight against climate change, our \r\nindividual actions will not have much influence if not \r\naccompanied by collective action. I could say the same \r\nof building a global economy that is more equitable and \r\nmore transparent. I have always said that the reality \r\nfor Andorra is also the reality for all, that for the \r\ngreat questions we address, the solutions all hinge on \r\nconsensus — otherwise they are not solutions. We must \r\nhave broad consensus based on individual convictions.\r\nThe convictions of Andorra are clear: they are the \r\nprinciples and values that almost 70 years ago inspired \r\nthe birth of the United Nations. Let us never forget the \r\nreason for this great Organization. If we forget, we are \r\nnot worthy of being here.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic \r\nof Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): At the outset, \r\nI should like to extend my warmest congratulations \r\nto Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I am \r\nconfident that under his able leadership this session \r\nwill enjoy great success. My appreciation also goes to \r\nMr. John William Ashe, President at the sixty-eighth \r\nsession, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for their \r\nimportant contributions to the work of our Organization \r\nover the past year.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly takes place as \r\nwe approach the seventieth anniversary of the founding \r\nof the United Nations. It gives us the opportunity to \r\nlook back on the past almost 70 years of the United \r\nNations implementing its mandate to assist nations \r\nto build a world of peace, security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, a world where fundamental rights and \r\nfreedoms are respected and promoted. It is also an \r\nopportunity for in-depth discussions on the formulation \r\nand implementation of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nThis year’s Assembly session is also convened \r\nagainst the backdrop of a world landscape that features \r\nnumerous turning points and contrasts. On the bright \r\nside, increasingly the United Nations is playing better \r\nits central role in the promotion of the system of \r\nrules and norms of international law, thus facilitating \r\nsolutions to global challenges, and of the interests of \r\npeace and development for all nations. Globalization \r\nand multilayered economic cooperation and linkages \r\ncontinue to evolve strongly. Our efforts to realize the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have brought \r\nencouraging results in most regions.\r\nWe see also a more sombre part, one that paints the \r\nmany daunting challenges the world is facing. The trend \r\nof cooperation contains risks, while global economic \r\nrecovery is yet to be sustainable. International peace \r\nand security are being challenged by the negative \r\nfactor of competition and intervention and especially \r\nby the potential escalation of territorial and sovereignty \r\ndisputes. Ongoing crises and conflicts in the Middle \r\nEast and a number of African countries have inflicted \r\nmajor human and material losses and threaten regional \r\nand international peace and security.\r\nGlobal challenges remain high on the agenda of the \r\ninternational community. Terrorism, the proliferation \r\n14-55132 5/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nof weapons of mass destruction, nuclear security and \r\nsafety, environmental pollution, depletion of natural \r\nresources, climate change, natural calamities, epidemics \r\nand the lack of food and water security are issues of \r\nprimary concern to the international community. They \r\nrequire enhanced joint efforts.\r\nPeace and security are prerequisites for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The United Nations and its Member \r\nStates must live up to their responsibility to strengthen \r\ninternational peace and security, prevent potential \r\nconflicts and find solutions to ongoing hostilities. \r\nThat is an urgent task, but it also requires long-term \r\nengagement. History has taught us that the paths that lead \r\nto wars and conflicts lie in obsolete doctrines of power \r\npolitics, of ambitions of domination and imposition, and \r\nof the threat of force in settling international disputes, \r\nincluding territorial and sovereignty disputes.\r\nViet Nam believes that respect for international \r\nlaw is the foundation of peace, security and stability \r\nfor sustainable development. More than ever, Member \r\nStates, big or small, rich or poor, must all respect and \r\nseriously observe the principles, rules and norms of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw. All nations must renounce the use of force as an \r\noption in their international relations and instead settle \r\nall disputes by peaceful means. That is a crucial area \r\nin which the United Nations represents a powerful \r\nadvance from the League of Nations, and it commands \r\ngreater commitment and effort from Member States.\r\nIn that spirit, Viet Nam looks forward to substantive \r\nprogress in the negotiations for a comprehensive, fair \r\nand long-term solution for peace in the Middle East that \r\nwill ensure the fundamental rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople and the legitimate interests of all parties. We are \r\ndeeply concerned about the escalating violence in Iraq. \r\nand we support the efforts of the Iraqi Government and \r\nthe international community to stabilize the situation. \r\nWe call for an end to unilateral economic sanctions \r\nagainst developing countries and support General \r\nAssembly resolutions on ending the economic embargo \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nViet Nam strongly condemns all acts of terror in \r\nany form, especially the targeting of civilians. We \r\nsupport all international efforts and initiatives to \r\ncombat that menace in accordance with international \r\nlaw and the United Nations Charter. In addition, we all \r\nhave a stake in economic restructuring, job creation, \r\nachieving a balanced, inclusive and sustained growth, \r\nand in maintaining a peaceful and stable environment \r\nconducive to development.\r\nIt is therefore our primary task to complete the \r\nMDGs and formulate the post-2015 development agenda \r\nto create added momentum for sustainable development \r\nin each country and for international economic linkages. \r\nIn that process, the United Nations should focus more \r\nactions and resources on addressing social injustices \r\nand inequalities. It should provide stronger support to \r\nregional and subregional programmes for connectivity, \r\npoverty reduction, narrowing the development gap \r\nand building the green economy. That will lay a firm \r\nand long-term foundation for peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. In so doing, and to adapt itself to a \r\nconstantly changing world, the United Nations must \r\naccelerate its reform process in a comprehensive, \r\nbalanced, transparent and equal manner in the interests \r\nof all Member States. The Security Council must be \r\nreformed in both membership and working methods \r\nto better respond to global challenges to peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nIn its national socioeconomic development and in its \r\ninternational integration, Viet Nam has always attached \r\nimportance to the roles of multilateral institutions \r\nand forums, especially that of the United Nations, in \r\nthe areas of international and regional security and \r\ndevelopment. Viet Nam is proud to be an active and \r\nresponsible member of important regional and global \r\norganizations, such as the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nthe Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation and the Asia-\r\nEurope Meeting. Viet Nam is doubling its efforts to \r\nachieve all MDGs and is actively participating in the \r\nformulation of the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIt is our consistent, principled position to respect \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States and \r\nto settle international disputes and conflicts, including \r\nthe issue of the East Sea, or South China Sea, by \r\npeaceful means in accordance with international law, \r\nincluding the 1982 United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. Viet Nam abides by the Declaration \r\non the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and \r\nworks to ensure an early adoption of the code of conduct \r\nfor parties in the South China Sea.\r\nWe support efforts to strengthen the multilateral \r\ntrade system to create fresh momentum for the world \r\neconomy in order to regain sustained growth. Viet Nam \r\nis willing to join global efforts to enhance economic \r\n6/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nlinkages and reform the global economic and trade \r\ngovernance towards greater equality, democracy, \r\ntransparency and efficiency.\r\nViet Nam and other ASEAN member States are \r\nworking hard to establish the ASEAN Community in \r\n2015 with three pillars: political-security cooperation, \r\neconomic cooperation and social-cultural cooperation. \r\nThat, we believe, will help to build a South-East Asian \r\nregion of peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity \r\nand to form a regional architecture with ASEAN at the \r\ncentre, founded upon international law and aimed at \r\ndeveloping common rules and norms for the region.\r\nTo contribute to international efforts to enhance \r\nprinciples and norms for peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights, Viet Nam is playing an \r\nactive and constructive role as a member of the Human \r\nRights Council. For the very first time, Viet Nam has \r\ndispatched its military officers to the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping mission in South Sudan. Looking \r\nforward, Viet Nam has presented its candidature for the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for the 2016-2018 term \r\nand for the Security Council for the 2020-2021 term. \r\nWe count on the valuable support of members.\r\nPeace and development are inseparable companions. \r\nThey complement each other on the path towards a \r\nprosperous world. We are confident that with political \r\nwill, mutual trust and equality based on international \r\nlaw and responsible joint actions, we can build stronger \r\npartnerships for peace, cooperation and sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Evangelos Venizelos, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Hellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Venizelos (Greece) (spoke in French): This \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace in a global context full of challenges, testing the \r\nefficiency of the current international system. Greece \r\nremains fully engaged with the objectives of the United \r\nNations, whose universal ideals have never failed to \r\ninspire us.\r\nI should like to take this opportunity to emphasize \r\nmy country’s alignment with the positions of the \r\nEuropean Union presented by the President of the \r\nEuropean Council in his statement (see A/69/PV.9).\r\nWe reiterate our support for efforts to reform the \r\nOrganization, including the Security Council, so that \r\nthe United Nations can better adapt to the ongoing \r\nchanges of our age and strengthen its operational \r\nnature and effectiveness in the exercise of preventive \r\ndiplomacy.\r\nAmong the challenges at the global level is \r\nobviously that of climate change, which is an absolute \r\npriority. A new universal agreement, legally binding \r\non all, is essential. Transition towards a new model of \r\ngreen economy with a low carbon footprint must be \r\naccelerated. Greece believes that the Climate Summit \r\nheld this week offered a unique opportunity to intensify \r\nthe efforts to achieve such a universal agreement.\r\nThe Greek presidency of the Council of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU), during the first half of 2014, \r\nsought to stress the importance of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. A significant joint statement was adopted \r\nin the framework of the ministerial meeting of the \r\nEuropean Union with African, Caribbean and Pacific \r\ncountries that was held in Nairobi last June.\r\nThe Ebola virus epidemic has become a genuine \r\nthreat to global peace and security with its serious \r\nsocial, economic and humanitarian repercussions. An \r\ninternational strategy is necessary to contain the virus \r\nand to avoid an unprecedented humanitarian crisis \r\nthat would precipitate the collapse of the health-care \r\nsystem and, eventually, of the social fabric of the States \r\naffected. Therefore we welcome the decision of the \r\nSecretary-General to establish the new mission, the \r\nUnited Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, \r\nand we pledge that Greece will offer its full support to \r\nany initiative taken in order to combat the epidemic.\r\nThe current complex security challenges require us \r\nto unite our forces, both internationally and regionally. \r\nGreece supports the strengthening of cooperation \r\nbetween the European Union and the United Nations \r\nin crisis management, particularly by implementing the \r\naction plan on United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe world is facing a series of unprecedented \r\ncrises in the Middle East and in North Africa, as well \r\nas the eastern area of the European Union. Of course, \r\nin the face of such multiple crises, a consistent and \r\nglobal comprehensive strategy is required. Certainly, \r\nfrom this standpoint the role of the United Nations, \r\nespecially the Security Council, is the deciding factor. \r\nThat is the only way that we will be able to deal with \r\nthe critical dilemma confronting us now, the dilemma \r\nbetween democracy and security. But if there is to be \r\ndemocracy, there must be a State that is functioning \r\n14-55132 7/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nand does not dissolve, as well as minimal security \r\nconditions.\r\nThe Ukrainian crisis seriously affects security \r\nand stability in Europe. We are concerned by the \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian situation in eastern Ukraine, \r\nand we support the territorial integrity, independence \r\nand sovereignty of Ukraine.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe support the 5 September Minsk agreement, \r\nthe full implementation of which can contribute to the \r\nresolution of the crisis through diplomatic and political \r\nmeans. The key is the achievement of an inclusive \r\nsolution.\r\nRegarding security concerns in our neighbourhood, \r\nwe welcome the adoption in Egypt of the 26 August \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian ceasefire agreement, which we \r\nhope will pave the way to relaunching the political \r\nprocess aimed at establishing a durable peace, which is \r\nobviously a prerequisite for a comprehensive solution \r\nallowing two States, Israel and Palestine, to coexist in \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s newly appointed Special \r\nEnvoy for Syria must continue efforts to ensure the \r\neffective relaunching of the Geneva II political process. \r\nThat is all the more imperative given the barbaric \r\nactions of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS) and other jihadist groups in Syria and the Iraqi-\r\nSyrian border regions. Foreign fighters joining jihadist \r\nterrorist organizations are a serious threat to regional \r\nand global security. As a member of the international \r\nalliance against ISIS and extreme jihadists, Greece \r\nfully supports the new Security Council resolution \r\n2178 (2014), on how the international community must \r\nact against ISIS and potential foreign fighters. In that \r\nregard, I wish to make special reference to the grave \r\nhumanitarian situation and increasing refugee pressure \r\non countries of the region, including Greece.\r\nMilitary means alone cannot eliminate the jihadist \r\nthreat. We must also promote an inclusive process of \r\nreconciliation and national dialogue in Iraq to counter \r\nthat threat to the country’s national unity and territorial \r\nintegrity. We remain seriously concerned at the \r\ndisplacement of civilians, and we strongly condemn the \r\nsystematic persecution of Christians and other religious \r\ncommunities.\r\nThe region’s stability is also under threat from the \r\nongoing violence in Libya. We strongly support the \r\nUnited Nations coordination of relevant international \r\nefforts. We therefore welcome the appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General’s new Special Representative.\r\nDeeply concerned at the life-threatening conditions \r\njournalists are increasingly confronting and the \r\ncensorship and persecution the media are facing, \r\nGreece co-sponsored last year’s resolution 68/163, on \r\nthe safety of journalists and the issue of impunity. We \r\nare now co-sponsoring this year’s draft resolution on \r\nthe protection of journalists.\r\nDuring its European presidency in the first half of \r\n2014, Greece emphasized Western Balkan integration \r\ninto the European Union. That objective requires \r\nimplementation of internal reforms in accordance with \r\nEU standards and the promotion of good-neighbourly \r\nrelations through regional cooperation, reconciliation \r\nand effective confrontation of the sources of nationalism. \r\nWe welcome the significant progress so far in the EU-\r\nfacilitated Belgrade-Pristina talks. We hope that the \r\ntwo sides will continue their constructive discussions \r\nin a spirit of compromise.\r\nWith respect to the issue of the name of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Greece fully \r\nrespects the process directed by the Secretary-General \r\nthrough his Personal Envoy, Mr. Matthew Nimetz, and \r\nalways participates constructively and with goodwill. \r\nGreece has already taken considerable steps. We are \r\nawaiting corresponding steps from the other side. We \r\npropose a mutually acceptable compound name, with \r\na geographical qualifier before the word “Macedonia”, \r\nfor all uses and purposes, internally and internationally, \r\nerga omnes.\r\nGreece supports the European and Euro-Atlantic \r\nperspective of that neighbouring country and has long \r\nbeen among the top foreign direct investors there. Its \r\nEuropean and Euro-Atlantic perspective hinges not on \r\nthe name or on Greece, but on respect for the general \r\ncriteria in place for all accession-candidate countries. \r\nIt hinges on issues of democracy, rule of law, respect \r\nfor human rights, harmonious inter-ethnic relations and \r\nfreedom of the press. As the relevant European Council \r\nconclusions say, tangible steps need to be taken on \r\nthose issues.\r\nThis past summer marked the fortieth anniversary \r\nof the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, and the international \r\ncommunity continues to confront the ongoing illegal \r\nmilitary occupation of the territory of a United Nations \r\nand European Union member State. Greece fully \r\n8/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nsupports the dialogue between the leaders of the two \r\ncommunities within the framework of the February \r\n2014 joint communiqué and the initiatives of President \r\nAnastasiades for confidence-building measures that \r\ncan create new momentum on the island.\r\nA just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem \r\nmust be in accordance with the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions, the high-level agreements, the February \r\n2014 joint communiqué and the European acquis. The \r\nCypriot people must express their agreement to such \r\na solution through a referendum. We also attach great \r\nimportance to maintaining the mandate, level and \r\nconcept of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in \r\nCyprus and to the Secretary-General’s good offices \r\nmission. We welcome the appointment of Mr. Eide as \r\nhis new Special Adviser on Cyprus.\r\nA just and viable solution to the Cyprus issue and \r\nrespect for international law, especially the international \r\nlaw of the sea, are two critical factors on which the \r\nfull development of Greek-Turkish relations depends. \r\nThese relations have great potential, and are critical to \r\nthe stability of the wider region as they are relations \r\nbetween two NATO member States, while Greece also \r\nsupports Turkey’s European perspective.\r\nChallenging times require demanding choices. \r\nThe United Nations is in a position to tackle the new \r\nchallenges, as it has so often done in the past, provided \r\nwe all share the same vision and, most importantly, the \r\nnecessary political will.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ri Su Yong, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Ri Su Yong (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): On behalf of the delegation of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, I should first \r\nlike to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea fully \r\nendorses the main theme of this session, “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”. Development is one of the \r\ncore missions of the United Nations. With peace, it \r\nconstitutes one of the two pillars for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of humankind. During the first 15 years \r\nof the new millennium, the world has seen the poverty \r\nrate reduced by half. It is proof of success, illustrating \r\nthe correctness of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nadopted at the Millennium Summit, with the elimination \r\nof poverty as the main target.\r\nIt has been a particularly difficult time for the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. However, \r\nwe too have overcome severe hardships. Despite \r\nan unprecedentedly persistent economic blockade, \r\nmilitary threat and political obstruction, we have firmly \r\nsafeguarded national dignity, effectively deterred war \r\nand put the stagnant economy on an upward track \r\nunder the leadership of the great General Kim Jong Il. \r\nToday we have at last secured a reliable springboard to \r\nleap into a powerful nation, following the guidance of \r\nrespected Marshal Kim Jong Un.\r\nIn the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\ntoday, a grand construction boom is in full swing, and \r\nmodern factories and enterprises befitting the era of \r\nthe knowledge economy are being built and founded at \r\nrecord-breaking speed in many parts of the country. We \r\nhave observed a great leap in our fishing industry and \r\nlivestock farming, as well as a blooming new twenty-\r\nfirst century civilization in the living environment and \r\ncultural and welfare spheres for future generations and \r\nthe working masses.\r\nThe climate change Summit held just a few days \r\nago was a successful gathering that constituted part \r\nof the active measures being taken across the United \r\nNations system to ensure the survival of humankind \r\nand sustainable development by protecting the global \r\necosystem and addressing climate change.\r\nThe United Nations and international relations \r\nshould be democratized further. The principle of \r\nsovereign equality enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations is exactly same as the principle of respect for \r\nsovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other nations. However, acts of high-handedness and \r\narbitrariness — veiled under various disguises such \r\nas democracy, humanitarian crises, counter-terrorism, \r\nhuman rights protection and non-proliferation — are \r\ncommitted brazenly in the form of sanctions, blockade, \r\nmilitary threat and armed intervention. That is the stern \r\nreality we witness today.\r\nProceeding from its consistent position of opposing \r\ninterference and sanctions in all their manifestations \r\nagainst sovereign States, our delegation holds that \r\nthe unilateral economic, trade and financial blockade \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba should be \r\nimmediately dismantled.\r\n14-55132 9/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nWith respect to the issue of enhancing the central \r\nrole of the United Nations, we see its functions and \r\nrole regarding peace and security lagging far behind \r\nothers. As stipulated in the Charter, Member States \r\nentrusted the Security Council with the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security as its first and foremost \r\nresponsibility. Present reality shows that in lieu of the \r\nSecurity Council — which is still mired in the paralysis \r\nof the Cold War — a permanent member seeks to act as \r\nthe military police of the world through military blocs \r\nor bilateral military alliances that have nothing to do \r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nThe anachronistic stereotypes and prejudices of the \r\nSecurity Council find their most extreme expression \r\nin the prevailing situation on the Korean peninsula. \r\nThe world remembers that the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula reached the touch-and-go brink of war last \r\nyear. It started with the United States-South Korea joint \r\nmilitary exercises aimed at occupying the capital city \r\nof Pyongyang of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea.\r\nIn January, the Government of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea made a proposal to \r\nstop hostile military acts on the Korean peninsula, \r\nbut provocative joint military exercises against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea were forcibly \r\nconducted in March, April and August. The Government \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic officially referred \r\nto the Security Council the issue of suspending such \r\nwar exercises, which seriously endanger the peace and \r\nsecurity of the Korean peninsula and the region as a \r\nwhole. However, the Council turned its back. As the \r\njoint military exercises were led by one of its permanent \r\nmembers, the Council was bound to close its eyes, block \r\nits ears and shut its mouth, no matter how enormous in \r\nscale, aggressive in purpose and dangerous in nature \r\nthey were.\r\nEven in the Cold War period, measures were in \r\nplace between the East and the West to restrict the \r\nnumber of military exercises in which more than 40,000 \r\ntroops took part. We are obliged to ask why such war \r\nexercises, with the participation of more than 500,000 \r\ntroops at a time, are needed annually only on the Korean \r\npeninsula, nearly a quarter of a century after the Cold \r\nWar ended.\r\nAt present, the Government of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has set economic \r\nconstruction and improvement of the people’s living \r\nstandards as its major task. Accordingly, a peaceful \r\nenvironment is vital in allowing us to lead the recently \r\nimproving trend of the national economy to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. A peaceful environment and the reduction \r\nof tensions are more precious to us now than at any time. \r\nThe tense situation on the Korean peninsula does not \r\nhelp us. On the contrary, it presents a serious obstacle \r\nto our efforts to achieve economic development and an \r\nimproved living standard.\r\nWar exercises focused on landing, long-range \r\nnuclear bombing and commando operations aimed at \r\noccupying the capital city of another country can never \r\nbe viewed as defensive. The claim that they are annual \r\nin nature is just a veiled attempt to succeed in a surprise \r\nattack after creating chronic immunity to them.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should no \r\nlonger be delayed. The Council’s current structure \r\nand method of work have long been out of date, as \r\nconfirmed by the expressed general will of Member \r\nStates reflected in resolution 47/62, adopted in 1992. \r\nThe Security Council should no longer be an exhibition \r\nshowcase for the extreme manifestation of the double \r\nstandard. We must put an end to the unjust practice \r\nwhereby the military exercises waged by a permanent \r\nmember of the Council are covered up with no regard \r\nto their serious threat to peace and security, whereas \r\nthose conducted by a Member State in response are \r\ncalled into question, although they are inevitable and \r\nself-defensive in nature.\r\nLikewise, the Security Council simply ignores \r\nthe killing of Palestinian civilians by Israel under the \r\npatronage of a permanent member, yet selectively takes \r\nissue with the actions of the Syrian Government in \r\ndefence of the sovereignty and stability of its country. \r\nThis unjust practice cannot be tolerated. In particular, \r\nno act should be allowed to encroach on the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of Syria under the guise of \r\ncounter-terrorism.\r\nThe Security Council should no longer serve as \r\na forum for the spreading of lies. Eleven years ago, \r\nwe heard with our own ears the accusation made at a \r\nSecurity Council meeting by a permanent member \r\nthat there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq \r\n(see S/PV.4701). A military invasion followed, and \r\ntragic bloodshed resulted. Only then did the world \r\ncome to realize that it had heard the big lie of the \r\ncentury. However, because the big lie had come from \r\na permanent member, the Security Council kept silent \r\nagain. As a result, the bloodshed continues even today, \r\nafter 11 years.\r\n10/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nThe Security Council should not be abused as a \r\ntool to justify high-handedness and arbitrariness. The \r\nUnited Nations Charter stipulates that the Security \r\nCouncil should act in conformity with the principles \r\nof justice and international law. The Security Council \r\nhas no authority to adopt a resolution that prohibits the \r\npeaceful launch of a satellite by a Member State, as that \r\nis in contravention of international law, in particular the \r\nTreaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States \r\nin the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including \r\nthe Moon and Other Celestial Bodies.\r\nMrs. Perceval (Argentina), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair\r\nThe reform of the Security Council would, \r\nin essence, democratize the United Nations and \r\ninternational relations. The United Nations is not a \r\nmonarchy and the Security Council is not a senate. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council will not be possible \r\nunless its members decide in good faith to give up their \r\nprerogatives in the interests of democracy. Given the \r\nchanging times and the demands of the majority of \r\nMember States, the permanent member that is most \r\nvociferous about the export of democracy should reflect \r\non whether or not its preaching is just hypocrisy. Should \r\nthe Security Council fail to reform itself and remain \r\nout of step with the times, Member States may well opt \r\nfor a United Nations without such an anachronistic and \r\nundemocratic Council.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nmaintains that all problems pertaining to international \r\nrelations should be resolved not by high-handedness and \r\narbitrariness, but in strict accordance with the principles \r\nof sovereign equality enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter. The nuclear issue is a matter of the sovereignty \r\nand the right to exist of a Member State and must take \r\nprecedence over peace and security. The hostile policy, \r\nnuclear threat and stif ling strategy pursued by the \r\nUnited States for more than half a century inevitably \r\nprompted the decision of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to become a nuclear-weapon State.\r\nThe nuclear deterrent of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is neither intended to threaten or \r\nattack others, nor a bargaining chip to be exchanged \r\nfor something else. The nuclear issue will be resolved if \r\nand when the substance of the threat to our sovereignty \r\nand right to life is removed through the termination \r\nof the hostile policy of the United States towards the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nPoliticization, selectivity and double standards are \r\nout of place when dealing with human rights issues. The \r\nabuse of human rights for political purposes is in itself \r\nthe biggest human rights violation. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is firmly opposed to all \r\nattempts and actions to force regime change on specific \r\ncountries by alleging abuse of human rights. The United \r\nStates does not recognize the national sovereignty that \r\nsafeguards the human rights of our people. That being \r\nthe case, it is hypocritical of it to find fault with our \r\nhuman rights issues. It is all the more preposterous \r\nthat the United States should talk about a human rights \r\ndialogue when it adamantly prevents the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea — the party directly \r\ninvolved — from participating in the meeting on the \r\nlatter’s own human rights situation.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is \r\nalways open to dialogue and cooperation in the case of \r\ngenuine human rights issues that are devoid of any form \r\nof political motivation or hypocrisy. The Government of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is willing to \r\npromote human rights dialogue and cooperation on an \r\nequal footing with other countries that are not hostile to \r\nit. It is also willing to facilitate technical cooperation, \r\ncontact and communication with the United Nations \r\nand other international organizations in the human \r\nrights field.\r\nThe reunification of the fatherland is the supreme \r\ndesire of the entire Korean nation. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea maintains that national \r\nreunification should be achieved not through a \r\nconfrontation of systems but by a confederation formula \r\nwhereby two systems coexist in a single country. It \r\nis the only way to prevent war and safeguard peace. \r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea is sincerely striving by both word and deed \r\nto develop inter-Korean relations and to orient them \r\ntowards reunification through confederation.\r\nAs South Korea has relinquished its military \r\nprerogatives to the United States in their entirety, it \r\nhas no idea how many weapons of mass destruction of \r\nvarious kinds — capable of destroying the Korean nation \r\nmore than hundreds of times over — are now deployed \r\nand hidden on its own soil. It should therefore refrain \r\nfrom prattling and dreaming about the unrealistic and \r\nfictitious proposal for reunification copied from the \r\nformula of other countries.\r\nI should like to assure members that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will constructively \r\n14-55132 11/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nparticipate in delivering on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda at the current session and thus make an active \r\ncontribution to the work for the successful adoption \r\nof the development agenda next year on the occasion \r\nof the seventieth anniversary of the founding of the \r\nUnited Nations. Independence, peace and friendship \r\nare the foreign policy ideals of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. As in the past, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will fulfil its responsibilities \r\nand discharge its role as an independent Member \r\nState by steadfastly adhering to these ideals in United \r\nNations activities.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ramtane Lamamra, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the People’s Democratic Republic of \r\nAlgeria.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nshould like at the outset to express my satisfaction at \r\nseeing Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Uganda, an African neighbour, brother and friend, \r\npresiding over this important session of the General \r\nAssembly and to assure him of our full cooperation. \r\nI should also like to hail his predecessor the outgoing \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. John Ashe, and \r\nto pay homage to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis work in driving forward the role and missions of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe theme of the general debate focuses on the \r\nfuture and the prospects for future generations. This \r\nreminds us, on the eve of the global summit on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda and of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations, of the urgency of \r\nmaking a renewed commitment to multilateralism \r\nfounded on international law.\r\nGiven the persistence and varied manifestations of \r\nthe current crisis, we must have a comprehensive vision \r\nin order to make the United Nations a builder of lasting \r\nsolutions to modern global problems. We are banking \r\non the hope that the new sustainable development goals \r\n(SDGs) will contribute to bringing about a world that \r\nmakes it possible for us effectively to protect human \r\nrights, guarantee the inclusive participation of all, and \r\nensure that everyone — particularly those living in \r\nthe forlorn regions in which 40 per cent of the poorest \r\npeople live — shares in prosperity.\r\nThat was the formulation expressed by the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) at the seventeenth \r\nMinisterial Conference hosted by Algeria in May, in \r\nreaffirming the relevance and importance of the right to \r\ndevelopment and the pressing need to eradicate poverty, \r\nwhich has been identified as a global challenge and a \r\ncentral objective of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nAlgeria is pursuing its efforts to reach a comprehensive \r\nand ambitious agreement on the SDGs and on climate, \r\nto include, in the case of the latter, desertification and \r\naccess to genetic resources. Furthermore, we must see \r\nthe implementation of commitments, whether they are \r\ncommitments made as official development assistance \r\nor within the Monterrey Consensus, in the Doha \r\nDeclaration or at the United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nAt the United Nations, Algeria coordinates the \r\nNAM working group on the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In that role, Algeria will continue its \r\nefforts to ensure that the NAM working group, which \r\nis the most representative in the international system, \r\nassumes its full role. At the same time, Algeria will \r\ncontinue to work with its partners in the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten towards Security Council reform, \r\naimed at putting an end to the historical injustices \r\nvis-à-vis the African continent, which wants, more \r\nthan anything, representation and legitimacy in the \r\nSecurity Council. In that context, the strengthening of \r\ncooperation and the multiform partnerships between \r\nthe African Union and the United Nations should be \r\nencouraged, in particular in the context of the many \r\nconflicts and crises that continue to aff lict Africa and to \r\nslow down the conclusion of its decolonization process.\r\nFrom that perspective, the global review that \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon is called upon to present in April \r\n2015 on the question of Western Sahara, which pits the \r\nKingdom of Morocco against the Frente Popular para \r\nla Liberación de Saguía el-Hamra y de Río de Oro, \r\nmust honour the United Nations doctrine in the matter \r\nof decolonization, as well as stress the importance of \r\nthe relevant Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions. Algeria supports the inalienable right of \r\nthe people of Western Sahara to self-determination, as \r\nhas been well established, and in that regard Algeria \r\nencourages the Secretary-General and his Personal \r\nEnvoy, Ambassador Christopher Ross, to intensify \r\ntheir efforts to ensure the success of that effort to move \r\ntowards peace.\r\nAlgeria is a stakeholder in the common destiny of \r\nthe peoples of the Maghreb. Algeria’s own development \r\nhas been conceived and guided by the desire to \r\nachieve the integration of the vast geopolitical space \r\n12/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nof which it is at the very centre. The policy platform \r\non which President Bouteflika was re-elected and \r\nthe five-year plan of action of his Administration \r\nhinge on a deepening of participative democracy, the \r\nmodernization of the judiciary, equal opportunities for \r\nmen and women, and good governance. The economic \r\neffort has allocated significant public investment \r\nin the sectors of agriculture, industry, energy, the \r\nenvironment and tourism, and into the diversification \r\nand modernization of the economy, all based on \r\nobjectives tied to competitiveness and a substantial \r\nrelaunching of growth. At the same time, Algeria \r\nis working to promote development with mutually \r\nbeneficial strategic partners, based on respect for \r\nsovereignty and a balance of interests, in order to bring \r\nabout opportunities for cooperation and the means of \r\ntackling the challenges and threats of a transnational \r\nnature. That cooperation excludes unilateral measures \r\nsuch as the embargo imposed on Cuba.\r\nThe worrisome spread of the Ebola virus has been \r\ndeclared by the World Health Organization (WHO) \r\nto be a global health emergency, and that reminds us \r\ntragically of the structural precariousness of human \r\nsecurity systems, as well as of the responsibility of \r\nthe international community in the treatment of health \r\nproblems that affect the poor, who have no means or \r\nrole in decision-making. Algeria adds its voice to that \r\nof the Secretary-General in urging the United Nations \r\nagencies and other donors, as well as non-governmental \r\norganizations, quickly to provide the international \r\nassistance needed by the African countries that have \r\nbeen hit by that scourge.\r\nThat existential threat is yet another that Africa \r\nmust collectively take on in order to ensure its rebirth, \r\nand brings with it challenges in the area of peace and \r\nsecurity. At the behest of the stakeholders in Mali, \r\nAlgeria is undertaking large-scale mediation between \r\nthe Malian Government and the movements in the north \r\nof that country, working with a team that is representative \r\nof Africa and the international community as a whole. \r\nThe adoption of a road map for negotiations in the \r\nAlgiers process and the declaration of a cessation of \r\nhostilities have marked the effort towards the launching \r\nof substantial negotiations since 1 September, with the \r\naim of achieving a comprehensive and definitive peace \r\naccord. The launching of those negotiations has been a \r\nsource of satisfaction and coincides with the freeing of \r\ntwo Algerian diplomats who had been held hostage for \r\nnearly three years by a terrorist organization. I should \r\nlike to avail myself of this opportunity to pay homage \r\nto the memory of our Consul in Gao and his assistant, \r\nTahar Touati, who lost their lives during their period of \r\ncaptivity.\r\nThe situation in Libya, a sister nation, has continued \r\nto deteriorate over the past three years. The twofold \r\nAlgerian initiative to implement a common plan of \r\naction for all of the countries neighbouring Libya and \r\nfor launching an inclusive dialogue towards national \r\nreconciliation, which would also seek to strengthen \r\nState institutions, has made a valuable contribution \r\ntowards a collective, healthy step towards peace for the \r\nLibyan people, which we very much wish for them.\r\nThe difficult state of affairs in our region requires \r\na stepping up of efforts in the fight against terrorist \r\ngroups in the Sahel and their established links to drug \r\ntrafficking networks and transnational organized \r\ncrime. In the global forum of the fight against terrorism, \r\nAlgeria will continue to cooperate, including in its \r\nwork as co-Chair of the Working Group on the Sahel, \r\nand will focus on securing borders and on preventing \r\nransom-seeking abductions by terrorist organizations, \r\nbearing in mind the recommendations from the Algiers \r\nworkshop in September 2013 and the relevant resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly and Security Council.\r\nIn that spirit, Algeria notes with interest the results \r\nof the high-level Security Council meeting on terrorism \r\nand foreign combatants, convened on the initiative of \r\nPresident Obama (S/PV.7272). We also take note of \r\nthe international mobilization against transborder \r\nterrorism on a large scale, which is relevant to Iraq and \r\nSyria. The execution of French citizen Hervé Gourdel \r\nin Algeria underscores the need to strengthen the fight \r\nagainst terrorism in all its forms.\r\nThe earth-shattering developments that affect the \r\nlives of people in the Middle East add new questions \r\nwith regard to the uninterrupted role played by the \r\ninternational community vis-à-vis the tragedy inflicted \r\nupon the brotherly Palestinian people. The history of \r\nhumankind shows that armed conflicts give rise to \r\nother conflicts and that only by working towards justice \r\nwithin law and morality can we find lasting solutions. \r\nThe Palestinian question and the Syrian crisis must \r\nbe approached along those lines. I should also like to \r\navail myself of this opportunity to pay homage to the \r\nefforts of my compatriot, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, and to \r\nreiterate our support to his successor, Mr. Staffan de \r\nMistura.\r\n14-55132 13/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nThe ninth Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Weapons should \r\nfocus on the close, complementary nature of the \r\nobjectives of disarmament, non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons and the promotion of the peaceful uses of the \r\natom. Let there be no doubt that much remains to be \r\ndone when it comes to freeing the world of weapons of \r\nmass destruction.\r\nAlgeria, as a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nis motivated by a strong sense of responsibility to \r\nparticipate actively in the promotion of the universal and \r\ninterdependent nature of human rights. The President \r\nof the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Bouteflika, and \r\nthe Algerian authorities are working hard to improve \r\nthe living conditions of Algerian citizens in many \r\ndifferent areas. We have laws that criminalize violence \r\nagainst women and children, and we are strengthening \r\nthe protection of the rights of divorced women and \r\nother legislative efforts that add to our political and \r\ninstitutional success in supporting Algerian women. \r\nWe have been addressing such matters in our elected \r\nbodies and our central Government.\r\nThe celebration in 2015 of the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations should be an opportunity to \r\nrenew the commitment of all Member States to bring \r\nnew and stronger vigour, efficacy and credibility to \r\nmultilateralism. We have the joint responsibility to \r\nwork to establish a world that is safer and fairer and \r\nshows more solidarity. This powerful juncture, at \r\nwhich we bring together all of our peoples within the \r\nfold of our founding values, should also be confirmed \r\nby action. There are apprehensions, uncertainties and \r\nchallenges tied to fear and need, but if we face up to \r\nthem the United Nations will certainly live up to its \r\nrole as the last haven for the hope of humankind in a \r\nbetter future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Oldemiro Marques Balói, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique.\r\nMr. Balói (Mozambique): It is a great honour for \r\nme to address the General Assembly on behalf of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Armando Emilio Guebuza, President of \r\nthe Republic of Mozambique, who could not attend this \r\ngathering owing to national commitments. However, he \r\nwishes the General Assembly successful deliberations \r\nat this session.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa, a distinguished son of our sisterly country, \r\nUganda, on his unanimous election to preside over this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We firmly believe \r\nthat his vision, wisdom and leadership will guide us \r\nto a comprehensive and results-oriented transformative \r\ndevelopment agenda. I assure him of the full support \r\nand collaboration of the delegation of Mozambique in \r\nthe fulfilment of his noble mission.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to Ambassador John \r\nWilliam Ashe for his devotion and for the pragmatic \r\nmanner in which he presided over the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of this body, and for his relentless efforts \r\nconstructively to guide the ongoing debate on the \r\narchitecture of the next development agenda.\r\nThe year 2015 will be a historic one, since the \r\nUnited Nations will reach the landmark celebration \r\nof its seventieth anniversary. That celebration will be \r\nenriched by the goal set in the year 2000 to halve poverty \r\nrates in the world by the year 2015, the conclusion \r\nof the next development agenda, and the adoption of \r\na new framework for climate change. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the theme for this session, “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”, as it will enhance the ongoing \r\ndeliberations under the United Nations umbrella on the \r\nnext development agenda, galvanized by regional and \r\nsubregional visions on that important topic.\r\nIn our deliberations, the results and challenges \r\nexperienced in the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) will undoubtedly be \r\nreferenced in shaping the next development agenda. We \r\nrecognize that much has been done in the framework \r\nof the MDGs. However, apart from accelerating the \r\nachievement of all goals, it is important to guarantee \r\nthe sustainability of those that were achieved and \r\naccelerate the implementation of those that are still \r\nlagging behind. It is our strong belief that the principle \r\nof inclusiveness must also be taken into consideration \r\nin order to build a common vision and to ensure \r\nglobal commitments and shared responsibilities in the \r\nimplementation of the next development agenda.\r\nTo that end, Mozambique undertook a national \r\nconsultation process on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, a process that echoes our vision that \r\nsustainable development can be achieved only with \r\na shared responsibility between Governments, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector. Mozambique’s national \r\n14/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nconsultation process resulted in a robust call for the \r\nnext development agenda to list the eradication of \r\npoverty as its overarching objective. To achieve that, it \r\nshould ensure the promotion of equitable, sustainable \r\nand inclusive economic growth, focusing on women \r\nand youth.\r\nThe consultation also emphasized the need for the \r\neradication of poverty and hunger, translated into the \r\nimprovement of living standards through access to \r\nbetter social services such as education, health, social \r\nwelfare, safe drinking water, sanitation and energy; \r\nthe preservation of peace and political stability, the \r\npromotion of democracy and the protection of human \r\nrights; economic diversification and transformation to \r\nspeed up technological modernization in sectors such \r\nas agriculture, industry, tourism and infrastructures; \r\nthe protection of marine and land biodiversity, \r\nincluding the sustainable use of natural resources; \r\neffective partnership for development, particularly for \r\naccess to science, technology and innovation; further \r\nenhancement of North-South cooperation, in the \r\nframework of global partnership in order to commit the \r\ndeveloped countries to meeting their internationally \r\nagreed development goals obligations; the strengthening \r\nof South-South cooperation; and, finally, agreement \r\non a common methodology to monitor and evaluate \r\nnational progress.\r\nIn addition, the experiences and challenges we faced \r\nin the implementation of the MDGs — particularly in \r\nthe accomplishment of Goal 8, “A global partnership \r\nfor development” — underline the need for a greater \r\ncommitment on the part of our development partners \r\nto increase their official development assistance, and \r\nfor funding climate resilience and disaster-prevention \r\nefforts in developing countries. A transformative post-\r\n2015 development agenda should include the need to \r\nstrengthen its financing mechanisms, concomitant \r\nwith the need to raise the contribution for domestic \r\nfinancing. Those expectations coincide with the \r\nemerging common vision at the subregional, regional \r\nand global levels. Therefore, we have a premonition \r\nthat the agenda will be adequately inclusive and bring \r\nthe much-needed transformation to deliver a world that \r\nis truly fit for all.\r\nAt this critical juncture, the successful conclusion of \r\nthe Doha Development Round is a matter of urgency. Its \r\ncontribution to the materialization of the development \r\nagenda as a whole cannot be overemphasized. In that \r\nregard, we are encouraged by the attempts of the World \r\nTrade Organization to restore the Doha negotiations \r\nand by the adoption of the Bali package, which are \r\nfundamental steps in the architecture of the Doha \r\nRound.\r\nWe are also encouraged by the positive trends in \r\nthe development of Africa. As the Secretary-General \r\nstates in his report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/69/1), Africa continues to make steady development \r\ngains. Economic growth reached 4 per cent in 2013 and \r\nis projected to reach 5.3 per cent in 2014. Foreign direct \r\ninvestment increased, and substantial progress has \r\nbeen made towards the attainment of the MDGs.\r\nIf those positive developments are to be sustained, \r\na transformative development agenda should reflect \r\nAfrica’s priorities and special needs, as expressed in its \r\nCommon Position on the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nIn addition, that encouraging environment can be \r\npossible only in the context of peace, political stability, \r\ndemocracy and respect for human rights. Therefore, we \r\nregret that conflict prevention, peacekeeping and the \r\nrebuilding of war-torn States remain among the most \r\ncomplex challenges facing the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community at large.\r\nIndeed, this session takes place in the context \r\nof grave instability and conflicts in the world, with \r\nenormous economic costs and severe humanitarian \r\nconsequences that are unacceptable. Additionally, \r\nthe complexity of some conflicts poses a challenge to \r\nthe authority of the United Nations and consequently \r\nundermines the founding principles of the Organization \r\nas well as the role of multilateralism in addressing \r\nglobal concerns.\r\nWe have been challenged by the dramatic evolution \r\nin the strands of terrorism threats, which spare no part \r\nof the world. Therefore, Mozambique welcomes the \r\nadoption, at the 7272nd meeting of the Security Council, \r\nheld on 24 September, of resolution 2178 (2014), which \r\ncalls for an urgent boost in international cooperation to \r\nprevent the support and f low of terrorist fighters to and \r\nfrom conflict zones.\r\nAs we craft our collective strategy to deal with \r\nall forms and manifestation of that human scourge, \r\nwe should not lose sight of the following elements. \r\nFirst is the need to strengthen multilateral approaches \r\nin full compliance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Secondly, the root causes of terrorism must \r\nbe addressed, as that scourge cannot and should not be \r\nassociated with any religion, nationality or civilization. \r\n14-55132 15/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nThirdly, it is necessary to address the underlying \r\nconditions, such as poverty, injustice, social exclusion \r\nand marginalization, that serve as fertile ground for \r\nextremist ideologies to breed and thrive.\r\nIn an interdependent and globalized world, \r\nmultilateralism refers to the collective and cooperative \r\nactions needed to address global challenges in a \r\ntransparent, inclusive and effective manner, thereby \r\ncontributing to order, stability and predictability. In \r\nthat context, the United Nations must be strengthened \r\nin order to continue effectively to play its role as the \r\nepicentre of multilateralism. Today more than ever \r\nbefore, we must take concrete actions to reinforce the \r\nstrategic role of the United Nations in the architecture \r\nof the global world.\r\nNotwithstanding the prevailing challenges to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we are \r\nencouraged by the efforts in place for the restoration of \r\npeace and stability in Mali, Somalia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan. We are also encouraged \r\nby the latest developments in Guinea-Bissau as a \r\nresult of the general elections that prompted the \r\npromising first steps towards much-needed political \r\nstability — a precondition for that sisterly country to \r\nprogress towards socioeconomic development. These \r\nachievements call our attention to the importance \r\nof cooperation and coordination between the United \r\nNations and the African Union and with the subregional \r\nbodies in effectively addressing the range of conflict-\r\nmanagement problems through preventive diplomacy \r\nand mediation initiatives that allow for rapid responses \r\nto regional and subregional crises.\r\nThe principle of the right to self-determination \r\ncontinues to be central to the full enjoyment of human \r\nrights. In that context, the United Nations ought to \r\ncontinue to be engaged in the fulfilment of those \r\nrights by the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara. \r\nMozambique reiterates its full support for a just and \r\nlasting solution to the problem of Palestine through \r\npeaceful means, in accordance with international law \r\nand all the relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, we are encouraged \r\nto note the initiative taken by the Chairperson of \r\nthe African Union in appointing His Excellency \r\nMr. Joaquim Alberto Chissano, former President of the \r\nRepublic of Mozambique, as a special envoy to the five \r\npermanent members of the Security Council plus Spain, \r\nin an effort to step up the search for a solution that will \r\nensure the fulfilment of the right of the Saharan people \r\nto self-determination, for which Mozambique reaffirms \r\nits unconditional support.\r\nAs I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, \r\nthe advent of 2015 represents a historic opportunity for \r\nthe United Nations to reshape global commitments in \r\nmany ways. As we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Organization, we must use the momentum to take \r\nconcrete steps to accelerate, in a sustained manner, the \r\nongoing process of reforms in the Organization, in \r\nparticular the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe inability of the United Nations to solve conflict \r\nsituations and political instability in the Middle East \r\nand Eastern Europe poses a challenge to its authority \r\nas the universal entity and multilateral political forum \r\nfor fostering dialogue in a multilateral framework. The \r\nsituation is worsened by the lack of substantive progress \r\nin the reform of the Security Council, almost 15 years \r\nafter the international community recommitted itself to \r\nthat important endeavour. It is our hope that at its sixty-\r\nninth session the General Assembly will deliver the \r\nmuch-awaited reform to democratize its representation \r\nand working methods and to strengthen its role in \r\nconflict prevention and the promotion of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nFreedom of choice with regard to political systems \r\nand to trade is an inalienable right of all States, \r\nirrespective of their size. In that connection, the need to \r\nbring to an end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba continues to be a matter of concern, for it \r\nis politically motivated and hinders the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of Cuba. For those reasons, Mozambique \r\njoins all those countries that demand the immediate \r\ntermination of that unfair unilateral measure.\r\nMozambique is fully committed to the global \r\nagenda for peace and security, democracy and \r\nsustainable development. At the national level that \r\ncommitment is translated into our political will to \r\nstrengthen democracy in the country and to adopt a \r\npoverty-reduction strategy that is people-centred and \r\npromotes sustainable development. The regularity \r\nwith which elections at different levels are held shows \r\nour unquestionable determination to consolidate the \r\ndemocratic system and defend its underlying values. As \r\na result, on 15 October Mozambique will hold its fifth \r\nmultiparty general elections to elect the President and \r\nthe Parliament, and its second elections for provincial \r\nparliaments.\r\n16/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nIn the economic sphere, Mozambique has enjoyed \r\nsteady economic growth for more than a decade. \r\nCoupled with the support of our development partners, \r\nincluding the United Nations, that has allowed for an \r\nimprovement in social services delivery and enabled \r\nus to be on track to attain the majority the MDGs. In \r\naddition, recently discovered natural resources represent \r\na challenge and an opportunity to further advance \r\nnational socioeconomic progress. The development \r\nof new sources of clean and renewable energy such \r\nas bio-fuels is a priority for the Government, and due \r\nattention is being paid to prevent competition with \r\nfood-production initiatives.\r\nTherefore, we are emphasizing the following \r\nareas: the improvement of agriculture production and \r\nproductivity in a sector that will continue to play a \r\nkey role in our development efforts; human capital \r\ndevelopment to address the new emerging economic \r\nchallenges; and the promotion of a strong private sector \r\nto take advantage of the opportunities brought about by \r\nthe discovery and exploitation of natural resources. It \r\nis our firm conviction that, with peace and stability, we \r\nwill continue successfully to address the development \r\nchallenges facing Mozambique, which have poverty \r\neradication and sustainable development at their \r\nepicentre.\r\nFinally, as part of our commitment to peace and \r\nstability, in June Mozambique hosted the third Review \r\nConference of the States Parties to the Convention on \r\nthe Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production \r\nand Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their \r\nDestruction, also known as the Ottawa Convention. \r\nI should like to take this opportunity to thank all \r\nparticipants as well as all partners that contributed \r\nto making that event a success, because it was. We \r\nare engaged in continuing our efforts to declare the \r\ncountry free of landmines and thus to contribute to the \r\nfulfilment of one of the most important steps in our \r\nobligations under the Convention.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to reiterate Mozambique’s \r\ncommitment to continue to be engaged in international \r\nefforts to address current global problems.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rui Machete, Minister of \r\nState and Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Portugal.\r\nMr. Machete (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese: \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset, I \r\nshould like to congratulate the President on his election, \r\nwhich testifies to the strong commitment of Africa to \r\nthe United Nations and to multilateralism. I also wish \r\nto express my appreciation for the dedication to the \r\nAssembly of his predecessor Ambassador John Ashe. I \r\nreiterate my gratitude to the Secretary-General for his \r\nleadership at the helm of our Organization and for his \r\nrelentless efforts in favour of peace in such a difficult \r\nand complex time in international life. I commend him \r\nalso for convening the Climate Summit, which has \r\nrenewed political support for the achievement in 2015 of \r\na fair, universal and legally binding climate agreement. \r\nPortugal, and the European Union as a whole, will \r\ncontinue to work tirelessly and in an inclusive manner \r\ntowards the achievement of that goal.\r\nDuring this session, we face the enormous challenge \r\nof renewing and building upon the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), with a view to adopting \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. The President may \r\ncount on the support and commitment of Portugal on that \r\nand other issues and in the ongoing work of the General \r\nAssembly, which is the first home of multilateralism \r\nand of legitimate international collective action. The \r\ncommitment of Portugal to the United Nations, to the \r\nCharter and to its principles and values is firm, resolute \r\nand enduring.\r\nAt this Assembly session, Portugal is a candidate \r\nfor the Human Rights Council for the 2015-2017 term. \r\nWe hope to have the support of all members in the \r\nupcoming election. If elected, Portugal will be serving \r\nfor the first time as a member of such an important \r\nbody.\r\nLast April Portugal underwent its second Universal \r\nPeriodic Review by the Human Rights Council. Our \r\npositive national human rights record was widely \r\nacknowledged. Portugal has actively participated in \r\nmultilateral human rights forums, in particular in the \r\nHuman Rights Council, submitting annual resolutions \r\non the right to education and on economic, social and \r\ncultural rights. We hope to be able to make an even \r\ngreater contribution to the Human Rights Council over \r\nthe coming three years, as we deeply believe in the \r\nCouncil’s ability to strengthen the capacity of States to \r\ncomply with their human rights obligations.\r\nIn that context, Portugal has submitted a bold set of \r\npledges and commitments that will guide the discharge \r\nof our mandate with the purpose of promoting and \r\nprotecting the universality, indivisibility, inalienability \r\nand interdependence of all human rights — civil, \r\ncultural, economic, political and social. Through our \r\n14-55132 17/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nactions during our last mandate in the Security Council, \r\nin 2011 and 2012, we demonstrated that consistently \r\npromoting and upholding human rights was a priority \r\nfor us. If elected to the Human Rights Council, Portugal \r\nwill engage in its work, fully committed to a strong, \r\nindependent and effective multilateral human rights \r\nsystem. Portugal is in fact a party without reservations \r\nto eight core United Nations human rights treaties and \r\nall their optional protocols.\r\nWe continue to witness events that we expected to \r\nsee eradicated in the twenty-first century — large-scale \r\nhuman rights violations, the deprivation of vast \r\npopulations of their most elementary dignity, and a \r\ndisregard for basic international principles such as the \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty of States. Today \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations remains as relevant \r\nas it was 69 years ago. In order to deal with the crises \r\nwe face today we must base our search for fair, legal \r\nand lasting solutions on the generous and ambitious \r\nprinciples and norms of the Charter. The Charter \r\noffers the necessary institutional mechanisms, but their \r\nfunctioning and effectiveness depend on the political \r\nwill of all Members of the Organization.\r\nTerrorist, extremist and radical groups deserve our \r\nmost vehement repudiation and condemnation. They \r\nconstitute, in the first instance, a threat to States and to \r\nthe populations of the territories in which they are based. \r\nThey also present a risk to regional and global peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. That menace requires concerted \r\nand firm responses from the international community. \r\nThe self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \r\n(ISIS) is a sinister example of that kind of criminal and \r\nbarbaric action. It must be fought and neutralized. The \r\nSecurity Council summit and resolution 2178 (2014), \r\nwhich it adopted on the worrying phenomenon of \r\nforeign terrorist fighters, were important steps in that \r\ndirection.\r\nThe Middle East continues to require special \r\nattention. In Iraq we have been witnessing inhumane \r\nterrorist actions targeting defenceless populations, \r\nvictimizing mainly women, children and persons \r\nbelonging to ethnic and religious minorities. The \r\nsituation in Iraq cannot be disconnected from the \r\nprolonged conflict in Syria, where the levels of violence \r\nand suffering are, by their dimension and duration, \r\nbeyond words. All parties must assume responsibility \r\nfor finding a political transition to a democratic and \r\npluralistic society.\r\nOnce again we come to the Assembly without \r\nprogress in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The \r\nexpectations that we all shared here a year ago have been \r\ndashed. The recurring cycle of hostilities must come \r\nto an end. The conflict we saw in Gaza this summer \r\nmust not happen again. I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate Egypt for brokering the ceasefire and to \r\nrecognize the efforts of other regional and international \r\npartners, including the Secretary-General and United \r\nStates Secretary of State John Kerry.\r\nThere will be no lasting peace or stability in \r\nthe Middle East without a solution to that issue. I \r\nreiterate my country’s support for a solution based on \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, establishing a sovereign, \r\nindependent and viable Palestinian State, living side by \r\nside with the State of Israel, whose legitimate security \r\nconcerns must be guaranteed.\r\nThe positive signs that we saw a year ago regarding \r\nthe Iranian nuclear programme were confirmed with \r\nthe signing of the Joint Plan of Action in Geneva. A \r\nnew political impetus is now needed. Portugal supports \r\nand encourages the ongoing negotiations with a view to \r\na comprehensive agreement.\r\nThe events of 2010 and 2011 in Northern Africa \r\nhad an unprecedented political, economic and social \r\nimpact. The countries there are now confronted with \r\nsignificant challenges with regard to the consolidation \r\nof political reforms, sustainable economic growth and \r\nsecurity. Portugal is currently co-chairing the Western \r\nMediterranean Forum, also known as the 5+5 Dialogue, \r\nwhich brings together 10 countries from the northern \r\nand southern shores of the Mediterranean. We wish \r\nto strengthen the contribution of that platform to the \r\nenhancement of cooperation and confidence-building \r\namong its countries.\r\nLibya is an important partner in that Forum, and it \r\nis with great concern that we see the deterioration of the \r\nsituation in that country. The international community \r\nmust give its assistance to the political transition \r\nprocess, but it is paramount that all Libyan stakeholders \r\ncommit to an inclusive, genuine and fruitful national \r\ndialogue.\r\nIn Europe, the Ukrainian crisis and the illegal \r\nannexation of Crimea brought back tensions that we \r\nthought were outdated. We welcome the ceasefire \r\nagreement and appeal for its full implementation. \r\nPortugal encourages the parties actively to seek a \r\n18/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nlasting political solution that respects the sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity, unity and democracy in Ukraine.\r\nAfrica is a significant partner for Portugal. \r\nAfrican States are not only political partners but also, \r\nincreasingly, business and investment partners in a \r\nrelationship based on parity and mutual benefits, which \r\ndrive job creation and economic development. While \r\nfully respecting Africa’s ownership, we also seek to \r\ncontribute to international efforts, notably those of \r\nthe United Nations, aimed at stabilizing conflicts or \r\npreventing security risks in Africa. Therefore, Portugal \r\nis participating in the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. We also stand \r\nready to engage in multinational efforts to strengthen \r\nsecurity in the Gulf of Guinea, and we are willing \r\nto cooperate in the reinforcement of the maritime \r\ncapacities of the countries of the region.\r\nIn recent months we have received good news from \r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, a friendly country and \r\nmember of the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries (CPLP). The restoration of constitutional \r\norder, the holding of free elections and the inauguration \r\nof legitimate democratic institutions, two years after the \r\nApril 2012 coup d’état, are surely praiseworthy signs of \r\nhope. The enormous socioeconomic difficulties and the \r\nrecurrent and severe political instability that Guinea-\r\nBissau has been suffering for a decade and a half did \r\nnot prevent the people from electing their new leaders \r\nthrough free, transparent and orderly elections.\r\nThe opportunity to turn the page of history must \r\nnow be seized. The people of Guinea-Bissau and the \r\nauthorities are taking the right steps. Consolidating the \r\nprogress achieved requires support from the international \r\ncommunity. International partners can and must play a \r\ndecisive role in areas such as financial assistance and \r\nbuilding technical capacity, underpinning the priorities \r\nidentified by Guinea-Bissau. Further, we believe that a \r\nstabilization force based on the Economic Community \r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) Mission in Guinea-\r\nBissau, possibly enlarged to incorporate new African \r\npartners and mandated by the United Nations, would \r\nbe appropriate. Therefore we welcome the initiatives \r\nsupporting Guinea-Bissau undertaken by the United \r\nNations, together with, in particular, the African Union, \r\nthe CPLP, ECOWAS and the European Union.\r\nAt the Millennium Summit, Heads of State and \r\nGovernment made the historic and inspiring decision \r\nto adopt the Millennium Development Goals. We now \r\nhave the responsibility to accelerate the achievement \r\nof those Goals while at the same time preparing \r\na new development agenda. Portugal is strongly \r\ncommitted to the definition of that new agenda. We \r\nneed a transformative new global partnership that \r\nmainstreams human rights and combats inequalities. It \r\nshould also promote peaceful, stable and just societies, \r\nadvancing also the important issues of population and \r\ndevelopment. Universality and shared responsibility \r\nare key concepts in that regard. But the universality of \r\nthe post-2015 agenda should not be synonymous with \r\ninsensitivity to the specificities of the least developed \r\nand most vulnerable countries, such as small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nNew challenges such as climate change, illicit \r\ntrafficking, piracy and pandemics are major threats \r\nin today’s world. The outbreak of Ebola in Western \r\nAfrican countries demands strong, combined efforts by \r\nthe international community to contain and eradicate \r\nthat plague. Portugal is participating in the current \r\nurgent global effort, notably in Guinea and in the \r\nframework of the United Nations operation.\r\nDespite the efforts of previous Presidents, the \r\nreform of the Security Council has not yet happened. \r\nPortugal’s position on that subject is well known. In \r\nspite of persistent differences of approach among the \r\nmembership, we must not give up. Together we must \r\nfind a solution, making the Security Council a body \r\nmore representative of today’s world. The seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations is an opportunity to \r\nbring about Security Council reform.\r\nPortugal is by tradition a seafaring nation and has \r\nrecently adopted a new national maritime strategy \r\nfocusing on blue growth. We actively support United \r\nNations efforts for the sustainable management of \r\nthe oceans and their resources, and we co-chair the \r\nworking group that will complete the first global report \r\nof the marine environment. We advocate the adoption \r\nof an international instrument, in the framework of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\non the conservation and sustainable use of marine \r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. In \r\nJune 2015 Portugal will organize a major international \r\nevent on oceans, the “Blue Week”, to promote debate \r\non maritime issues in all their dimensions. We look \r\nforward to broad participation in that event.\r\nThe Portuguese language is the principal link that \r\nbrings together the States belonging to the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries. It is a vehicle for \r\nglobal communication spoken by about 250 million \r\n14-55132 19/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\npeople in their everyday lives, in commerce, trade, \r\nbusiness, culture and social networks. It is also an \r\nofficial or working language in various international \r\norganizations, including specialized agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations. The CPLP has the ambition of having \r\nPortuguese as an official language of the United Nations. \r\nThe summit in Dili last July confirmed the vitality of \r\nthe CPLP. On that occasion Timor-Leste assumed the \r\npresidency of the Community, thus lending a whole \r\nnew dimension and scope to the CPLP by having its \r\npresidency located for the first time in Asia.\r\nI would be remiss not to refer to the fact that on \r\n20 November we will be celebrating the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child. Portugal is a party to that \r\ninstrument without reservations, as well as to its three \r\nOptional Protocols. I take this opportunity to call for \r\nthe universal ratification of the Convention and its \r\nOptional Protocols.\r\nDuring this sixty-ninth session we will also have \r\nbefore us a new draft resolution on establishing a \r\nmoratorium on the use of the death penalty. We hope \r\nthe draft resolution continues to enjoy significant and \r\nincreased support this year.\r\nIf we become a member of the United Nations \r\nHuman Rights Council as we hope, we will act in \r\naccordance with the principles of cooperation and \r\ndialogue. We will engage with all States and other \r\nstakeholders in order to build bridges for the full \r\nimplementation of human rights norms and standards. \r\nIf we garner the trust of the Assembly, it will be a \r\nprivilege to work, as a Council member, with the new \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nPrince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, to whom I reiterate our \r\nfull support. I also wish to pay a special tribute to the \r\nformer High Commissioner, Ms. Navi Pillay, for her \r\noutstanding job, often accomplished in particularly \r\ndifficult circumstances.\r\nI conclude with a reference to the First World \r\nWar, a tragic event mentioned at the very beginning \r\nof the United Nations Charter when it affirms the \r\ndetermination “to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought \r\nuntold sorrow to mankind”. As we mark the centenary \r\nof the First World War and prepare the celebration \r\nof the seventieth anniversary of our Organization, \r\nwe must bear in mind and reflect carefully on those \r\nwords of the Charter. The President can count on \r\nPortugal’s commitment to the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter in the pursuit of peace, development and \r\nrespect for all human rights.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Lubomír Zaoríálek, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Zaoríálek (Czech Republic): This year marks \r\nthe 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First \r\nWorld War. Yet in today’s world we are far from having \r\nachieved global peace. It therefore remains a major task \r\nfor the international community to achieve it. But that \r\nis not the only task that remains. In order to achieve \r\nglobal peace we also have to tackle two other equally \r\nimportant challenges, namely, to preserve global human \r\ndignity, and global prosperity.\r\nI would like to start with global security. Europe is \r\nthe continent that gave birth to the two most disastrous \r\nconflicts in human history. We Europeans have \r\nlearned our lesson. A large part of our continent has \r\nbeen spared violent conflicts for almost 70 years. My \r\ncountry celebrates 25 years since our return to freedom \r\nand democracy in 1989.\r\nYet even today a part of Europe is at war. The \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine, guaranteed by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Budapest \r\nMemorandum of 1994, was violated by the Russian \r\nannexation of Crimea and the activities of Russian-\r\nbacked paramilitary separatist forces in eastern \r\nUkraine. Despite the present armistice, we believe \r\nthat it is still the responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity to seek the de-escalation of a conflict that \r\nhas caused enormous suffering to the people of Ukraine \r\nand the loss of innocent lives of Ukrainians and other \r\npeople, as demonstrated by the downing of Malaysia \r\nAirlines Flight MH-17.\r\nThat is not all. We are alarmed at the continuing \r\naggravation of the security situation in northern Iraq. \r\nWe condemn the brutal acts of violence committed \r\nby the so-called Islamic State against local ethnic \r\nand religious minorities, as well as the murders of \r\ntwo innocent journalists and a humanitarian activist. \r\nThose acts constitute war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity. As we are currently seeing in Iraq, terrorism \r\nhas taken on a new dimension, and we must counter it \r\nwith the utmost determination. Therefore, we welcome \r\nPresident Obama’s strategy as well as other important \r\ninternational activities in that regard, including the \r\nSecurity Council summit on foreign terrorist fighters \r\n(see S/PV.7272).\r\n20/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nWith regard to Syria, we believe that the only way \r\nto achieve a stable peace in that war-torn country and \r\nto ensure much-needed safety and legitimate rights \r\nfor all Syrian people is through a negotiated political \r\nsettlement between the Syrian Government and the \r\ndemocratic opposition. The Czech Republic, appalled \r\nby the atrocities committed by the so-called Islamic \r\nState, urges all sides of the conflict in Syria to cease \r\nviolence and to start cooperating with the new United \r\nNations Special Envoy in order to find a lasting solution.\r\nMoreover, we must not omit the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict. We remain deeply concerned about the \r\nhumanitarian consequences of the conflict in the Gaza \r\nStrip. We have made an effort to provide assistance to \r\nthe victims through humanitarian aid. However, first \r\nand foremost, the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have \r\nto make every effort, with the help of the international \r\ncommunity, to renew genuine and comprehensive \r\nnegotiations. That is the only way to reach a lasting \r\nsolution that would bring about peace, dignity, security \r\nand prosperity for both Israelis and Palestinians.\r\nBut there is also something else: the global dignity \r\nof human beings. In speaking of acts of violence — and \r\nthe list I have provided is far from being exhaustive — we \r\nmust keep looking for the causes behind those acts \r\nand seek to eliminate them. We often see that such \r\nacts result from despair and from a lack of the basic \r\nneeds necessary to ensure human dignity, needs \r\nsuch as physical integrity, access to justice, political \r\nparticipation and basic freedoms, and also food, water, \r\nmedical care, education, tolerable working conditions \r\nand protection against discrimination on various \r\ngrounds. It is the responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity, represented by the United Nations, to \r\nensure that human dignity remains not only a declared \r\nprinciple of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nbut is also put into practice worldwide. I am proud that \r\nmy country can contribute to those efforts, building on \r\nthe humanist legacy of my great compatriots, the first \r\nCzechoslovak President, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, and \r\nthe first President of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel.\r\nThe first precondition for human dignity is the \r\npossibility of enjoying life without threats to one’s \r\nphysical integrity and physical suffering. For that \r\nreason the Czech Republic has vigorously supported \r\nthe concept of the responsibility to protect, with its \r\nstrong dimension of prevention and capacity-building. \r\nYet, when a conflict cannot be prevented for various \r\nreasons, the United Nations is ultimately responsible, \r\nthrough its peacekeeping role, for preventing the \r\nfurther deterioration of the situation, loss of life and \r\nhuman suffering. The Czech Republic has consistently \r\nparticipated in various European Union (EU) missions \r\ncomplementing United Nations peacekeeping efforts, \r\nnamely, in the EU Training Mission in Mali and in the \r\nMultinational Force and Observers mission in Sinai. I \r\ncan assure members that we will remain involved in the \r\nfuture.\r\nNational States and the international community \r\nshare responsibility for protecting people from atrocities. \r\nHowever, if they fail, it is necessary to establish \r\naccountability for serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights. The Czech \r\nRepublic continues firmly to support international \r\ncriminal justice and the International Criminal Court. \r\nOur primary task is to combat impunity and to enforce \r\nthe protection of civilians and vulnerable groups in \r\narmed conflicts.\r\nIt is a sad reality that in too many parts of the \r\nworld women are among the most vulnerable groups. \r\nWe continue to witness horrifying cases of violence \r\nagainst women and girls, including sexual violence. We \r\ncall on all States to adopt urgent measures to prevent \r\nsuch abhorrent incidents. When women are excluded \r\nfrom society and prevented from enjoying basic \r\nrights, participating in public life or simply exercising \r\na profession, it has a massive impact not only on the \r\ncountry’s development but also on its overall stability. \r\nWe expect the relevant United Nations bodies to step up \r\ntheir efforts to ensure a peaceful and dignified life for \r\nall, including women.\r\nIn order to reinforce the prevention of various \r\ntypes of conflicts, we fully support the Rights Up \r\nFront initiative launched by the Secretary-General. We \r\nunderstand that it is an appeal to the United Nations and \r\nits bodies and to Member States to ensure respect for \r\nhuman rights, good governance, fair and free elections \r\nand genuine participation in decision-making without \r\ndiscrimination. The Czech Republic, as a member \r\nof the Human Rights Council, has for the second \r\ntime presented a consensual resolution on political \r\nparticipation. In our view, giving everybody a chance \r\nto enjoy their civil and political rights through such \r\nparticipation is essential for building inclusive and \r\ntruly cohesive societies.\r\nA life of peace and dignity is unthinkable without \r\nthe enjoyment of economic, social and environmental \r\nrights. That can be achieved by fighting poverty, social \r\n14-55132 21/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nexclusion and all forms of discrimination and illiteracy. \r\nI am convinced that the Czech Republic has a lot to \r\noffer in that respect. We are among the countries with \r\nthe most equal distribution of wealth in the world. We \r\nare also a country with one of the lowest risks of falling \r\ninto poverty in the world. We have managed to maintain \r\na socially cohesive society, and we believe that that is \r\none reason why our society is free of serious tensions \r\nresulting in violent conflicts. We want to contribute our \r\nexperience to the efforts of the international community \r\nin order to build fair and prosperous societies across the \r\nplanet.\r\nThe key to building a fair society is sustainable \r\ndevelopment. To that end, we are committed to \r\nworking on a post-2015 development agenda that will \r\nformulate sustainable development goals based on the \r\n2000 Millennium Development Goals. The goals will \r\nbe global in nature, universally applicable and will \r\naddress persistent inequalities and new challenges \r\nfacing people and our planet. The promotion of good \r\ngovernance, the rule of law, human rights and the \r\nempowerment of women must remain among the \r\nstand-alone priorities, but they are also cross-cutting \r\nissues linking various agendas. In that context, we look \r\nforward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis report \r\nexpected by the end of the year.\r\nThe Czech Republic expects that the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals will have a true impact on the \r\nfashioning of a development policy that will correspond \r\nto the needs of present generations and improve their \r\nquality of life, but will not compromise the ability \r\nof future generations to meet their own needs. All \r\ncountries, rich and poor, should therefore be committed \r\nto creating an economically viable yet more socially \r\nand environmentally sustainable future. We hope to be \r\nable to take part in that effort through our membership \r\nin the Economic and Social Council, to which we are \r\ncandidates for membership starting in 2016.\r\nWe are also actively involved in the EU and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, and we are ready to support all the proposals \r\nand solutions that are considered most effective to \r\nreach the new global climate agreement, hopefully to \r\nbe concluded in Paris in 2015.\r\nI began by recalling the First World War and continued \r\nby enumerating three major challenges — global peace, \r\nglobal human dignity and global prosperity. They are \r\nenormous challenges. The United Nations has done \r\nimpressive work in fostering peace, human dignity \r\nand sustainable development. I am confident that next \r\nyear, when we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, we will have an \r\nopportunity not only to reflect honestly on where we \r\ncould do better, but also to appreciate the progress that \r\nwe have made together.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Arnold Nicholson, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Nicholson (Jamaica): I stand here today, as \r\na representative of a nation with strong ancestral ties \r\nto the African continent, to welcome the election \r\nof Mr. Sam Kutesa to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are confident \r\nthat the experience and skills that he brings to that \r\nhigh Office will be invaluable as we tackle the myriad \r\nchallenges that confront us today. To his predecessor \r\nAmbassador John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, I \r\nalso convey sincere appreciation for the leadership and \r\nvision that he showed in guiding our work, not the least \r\nof which was the success he achieved in setting the \r\nstage for the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe quest for peace and development has assumed \r\nan urgency we have seldom seen. We live in a time \r\nof great instability and conflict. At the same time, \r\nmillions of citizens face unbearable levels of hardship \r\nand endure unconscionable levels of suffering. Far \r\ntoo many of our fellow men and women are being left \r\nbehind. It rests within our grasp to build a better future \r\nfor our peoples. This is the time to put people firmly at \r\nthe centre of our development aspirations, to tackle the \r\nroot causes of conflict, to create a culture of peace and \r\nto entrench the principles of justice, equity, democracy \r\nand respect for the rule of law. Recommitment to the \r\nprinciples of multilateralism and fidelity to the ideals \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations are \r\ncentral to our efforts to accomplish those goals.\r\nIn the coming months, our attention will be focused \r\non elaborating an international development agenda \r\nfor the post-2015 period. That provides an invaluable \r\nopportunity for us to address the critical challenges of \r\npoverty, inequality, global insecurity and environmental \r\ndegradation. The post-2015 development agenda must \r\nhave poverty eradication as its central focus. In so \r\ndoing, we must give due regard to the developmental \r\nstatus of each country, in particular small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) and countries classified as \r\nmiddle-income. Implementing and delivering the post-\r\n22/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\n2015 development agenda requires a strong focus on the \r\nmeans of implementation.\r\nThe third International Conference on SIDS drew \r\ninternational attention to the unique vulnerabilities \r\nthat threaten the very existence and survival of that \r\ngroup of countries. Our ability to withstand the ever-\r\nincreasing risk of economic and environmental shocks \r\nrequires that we forge effective partnerships with other \r\nmembers of the international community. In short, we \r\ncannot do the job alone. Jamaica therefore welcomes \r\nthe support of the international community in joining \r\nforces with SIDS to negotiate the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action Pathway, which builds on the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy.\r\nLet me say, though, that support for SIDS \r\nmust continue beyond support for the International \r\nConference. Our concerns need to be addressed in the \r\ncontext of the post-2015 development agenda. Among \r\nthose concerns are the full and effective integration of \r\nSIDS into the multilateral trading system, an increased \r\nvoice and participation in international financial \r\ninstitutions, the application of more relevant methods \r\nfor measuring growth and representing our state of \r\ndevelopment, and increased support for efforts to \r\nenhance our resilience to natural hazards and economic \r\nshocks.\r\nWe welcome the outcome of the Climate Summit \r\nconvened by the Secretary-General. The participation \r\nof business interests, civil society and a range of \r\ninternational institutions highlighted the importance \r\nof promoting concerted action among various \r\nstakeholders to address climate change. While the \r\nthreats posed by climate change may be theoretical \r\nfor some, they are very real for those of us who live \r\nin the Caribbean. In recent years we have had to deal \r\nwith the increased frequency of hurricanes and their \r\nwidespread impact on our land, lives and livelihoods. \r\nThe financial impact of hurricanes adds to the burden \r\nof the dire economic challenges that we continue to \r\nbear. Our fellow Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\ncountries in the eastern Caribbean will no doubt share \r\ntheir recent experiences with f loods that lasted only \r\na few hours last Christmas but caused gross domestic \r\nproduct losses from which they have yet to recover.\r\nAs we prepare for the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change to be held in Lima later this year, all \r\ncountries must be engaged in a cooperative effort to \r\ndevise an appropriate response to climate change that \r\nwill result in a steep reduction in global greenhouse \r\ngas emissions. We also need action to follow up on the \r\nadditional document to be adopted by the Conference \r\nof the Parties, which may be a protocol, another legal \r\ninstrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange that will be applicable to all parties. In that we \r\ndare not fail. Our commitment to addressing climate \r\nchange must be given effect at the twenty-first session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties in Paris next year.\r\nThis year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, the most \r\nuniversally ratified human rights treaty. The year \r\n2014 also marks the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nhistoric International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment in Cairo. At the same time, we are on the \r\ncusp of the twentieth anniversary of the fourth World \r\nConference on Women in Beijing, to be celebrated \r\nin 2015. This is therefore an opportune moment to \r\nevaluate the progress made in safeguarding the rights \r\nof women and children. All children have the right \r\nto live a life free from fear and violence. That is the \r\nessential prerequisite for the development of their full \r\nrange of skills and talents. Earlier this year, Jamaica \r\nwas pleased to host, alongside the Secretary-General’s \r\nSpecial Representative on Violence against Children, \r\nan interregional meeting that examined the impact \r\nof violence against children. I urge members, as we \r\ncraft the post-2015 development agenda, to be seized \r\nof the importance of addressing the special needs of \r\nchildren and youth. We also call for special attention \r\nto be paid to achieving gender equality. Rooting out \r\nviolence against women, enhancing women’s economic \r\nempowerment and promoting their equal participation \r\nat all levels of decision-making should be essential \r\ntasks in that regard.\r\nI now turn to the problem posed by the heinous \r\nactivity of human trafficking, a crime of global \r\nproportions that exploits the most vulnerable among us, \r\nnot the least of whom are women and children. Jamaica \r\ncalls upon the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime to provide a framework for Member States to \r\ndevelop a robust programme to help to bring an end to \r\nthat affront to human dignity and freedom.\r\nWe cannot ignore the link between our efforts \r\nto spur development and the need to safeguard the \r\nhealth of our people. The challenges to security and \r\nsustainable development posed by threats to global \r\n14-55132 23/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\npublic health have been devastatingly illustrated by the \r\nrecent outbreak of the Ebola epidemic. As we heard just \r\ntwo days ago from the Director-General of the World \r\nHealth Organization, every day, every minute, counts \r\nin fighting the most severe public-health emergency \r\nseen in modern times. This is the time for courageous \r\npartnership, not inaction based on fear. An urgent and \r\nrobust international response is required to marshal all \r\nthe medical expertise and modern technologies that are \r\nat our disposal. The pandemic nature of global health \r\nthreats such as Ebola and HIV/AIDS, including the \r\nsilent killers of non-communicable diseases, require \r\nthat we employ measures to combat them that are \r\nsimilar in intensity and urgency to those used in the \r\nfight against other global challenges.\r\nJamaica is concerned that the conflicts in Syria, the \r\nGaza Strip, Iraq, Ukraine, South Sudan and Mali pose \r\nserious threats to regional and international security. \r\nThose conflicts are neither limited in scope nor confined \r\nto national borders. The instability in Libya, Yemen \r\nand the Central African Republic is equally troubling. \r\nOf even greater concern are the resulting humanitarian \r\ncrises and the widespread violations of human rights. It \r\nis undeniable that those crises are fuelled by the growing \r\npropensity to funnel and transfer conventional arms to \r\nnon-State actors, including rebel groups and separatist \r\nmilitias. The militarization of such groups often serves \r\nto further those conflicts rather than hasten their end.\r\nEach passing day, the international community is \r\nconfronted with new crises, the emergence of greater \r\nacts of barbarism, and the rise of more lethal terrorist \r\ngroups. In the past few months, we have witnessed the \r\natrocities of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \r\nand the downing of a civilian aircraft in Ukraine and \r\na United Nations peacekeeping helicopter in South \r\nSudan. We also dare not forget that it is now 166 days \r\nsince the Boko Haram terrorist group brazenly abducted \r\n200 schoolgirls, yet their desperate plight continues.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the number and scale of \r\nthose crises not only place extraordinary demands \r\non the international aid system, thereby hampering \r\nits capacity to respond, but also serve to desensitize \r\nthe international community to the horrific levels \r\nof suffering being borne by civilian populations. \r\nResolving those conflicts requires global and regional \r\ncooperation. It is clear also that conflict prevention \r\nmust assume greater prominence. We cannot continue \r\nto operate in crisis mode only. Our vision is that of \r\na United Nations transformed into a more effective \r\ninstrument for preventing conflict and securing just \r\nand peaceful settlements.\r\nRecent events in Gaza demonstrate that the need \r\nfor a lasting resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict remains as urgent as ever. Jamaica believes \r\nthat the cycle of violence will continue in the absence \r\nof a negotiated political settlement based on a just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive agreement that guarantees \r\nthe security of Israel and recognizes the Palestinian \r\nState within internationally recognized borders.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to disarmament, \r\nnon-proliferation and arms control. In the Caribbean \r\nwe are acutely aware of the pernicious impact of the \r\nproliferation of small arms and light weapons, fuelled \r\nby a dangerous nexus with the drug trade. That \r\ncombination is the single greatest cause of fear and \r\ninsecurity among our citizens. For the past two decades \r\nwe have remained resolute in our call for a global \r\npartnership to fight that scourge. We are pleased that, \r\nwith the fiftieth ratification of the Arms Trade Treaty \r\nearlier this week, that historic Treaty will enter into \r\nforce on 25 December.\r\nAll States, whether small or large, have a role to \r\nplay in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Jamaica is therefore honoured to assume the \r\nchairmanship of the First Committee at this sixty-ninth \r\nsession, which reflects our commitment to advancing \r\nthe objectives of disarmament, non-proliferation and \r\narms control.\r\nAmong the major milestones to be celebrated \r\nnext year will be the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Jamaica is firm in \r\nits commitment to the highest standards of respect \r\nfor international justice and supports the role of the \r\nCourt. Jamaica’s group of States has nominated the \r\nJamaican jurist Patrick Lipton Robinson as a candidate \r\nfor election to the International Court of Justice for \r\nthe term 2015-2024. His nomination demonstrates \r\nJamaica’s preparedness to contribute to the work of \r\nthe Court and underscores that all States, regardless of \r\nsize, can make a contribution to the development of the \r\nrules and norms of international law.\r\nIn 2015 we expect to erect a permanent memorial \r\nto honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. Its location outside this very Hall will serve \r\nas a place of meditation and solemn reflection on the \r\nhorrors of slavery and the need to prevent its recurrence \r\nand to address its ongoing legacy. I encourage Member \r\n24/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nStates to contribute to the Trust Fund established to \r\nunderwrite the cost of the memorial. Only a small \r\nshortfall remains. Let us press on to the end and meet \r\nthe final goal.\r\nJamaica looks forward to the commencement in \r\nJanuary 2015 of the International Decade for People \r\nof African Descent, through which the international \r\ncommunity will undertake a range of activities to address \r\nracism, xenophobia, discrimination and prejudice, as \r\nwell as systemic inequalities and underdevelopment. \r\nPeople of African descent must be engaged directly \r\nin the range of measures that can be taken to redress \r\nthe legacy of the historic wrongs they have suffered. \r\nCARICOM countries believe that reparatory justice is \r\nan important element in that process.\r\nJamaica remains opposed to the unilateral \r\napplication of economic sanctions and trade restrictions \r\napplied by one State against another. We reiterate our \r\nsupport for an end to the economic, financial and \r\ncommercial embargo against Cuba, and urge all States \r\nthat continue to apply such measures to repeal or \r\ninvalidate such laws. We have it within our power to \r\nshape a world that is just and equitable and that embraces \r\nboth peace and development with equal fervour. As we \r\nprepare to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations next year, we recommit to the lofty \r\ngoals enshrined in the Charter — peace and security \r\nand the economic and social advancement of all people. \r\nLet us get on with the task.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Zarar Ahmad Osmani, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Osmani (Afghanistan) (spoke in Pashto; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to express my sincere congratulations \r\nto the President on his well-deserved election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. We are confident that his wisdom and \r\nexperience will ensure constructive and fruitful \r\ndeliberations on the very important and vital issues \r\nbefore the Assembly. I should like to assure him of the \r\nfull cooperation of my delegation to that end. I also \r\nexpress my deep appreciation to his predecessor and \r\nmy gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ncompetent and excellent leadership of the Organization.\r\nI am delighted to report to the Assembly that \r\nAfghanistan has achieved a significant milestone \r\nwith the successful conclusion of its presidential \r\nelections, including the important task of recounting \r\nthe votes. The new President, Mr. Mohammad Ashraf \r\nGhani Ahmadzai, will be sworn in on 29 September. \r\nAfghanistan is witnessing the transfer of power from one \r\nelected administration to the next. While Afghanistan \r\nfaces marked challenges, we are confident that the new \r\nGovernment, which enjoys the full backing of the vast \r\nmajority of Afghans, will strive to bring about political \r\nsecurity and socioeconomic prosperity to Afghanistan \r\nand, by extension, to the region and beyond.\r\nIt was more than a decade ago that many countries \r\nof the world joined the Afghan people in their struggle \r\nfor peace and fought against the forces of extremism \r\nand terrorism. In that regard, we have collectively \r\nachieved tangible results. Unfortunately, however, \r\nthe menace of terrorism and extremism continues to \r\nthreaten security, socioeconomic development and \r\npeace, not only in Afghanistan but also in the region. \r\nThere is an urgent need for a comprehensive response \r\nto the threats from terrorism, drugs and extremism at \r\nthe regional and international levels.\r\nToday, Afghanistan has credible political \r\ninstitutions, an elected Parliament, a Constitution \r\nand elected provincial councils supported by the \r\nbrave Afghan National Security Forces. The people \r\nof Afghanistan have witnessed many positive \r\nachievements in the past decade, including in the fields \r\nof socioeconomic development, education — especially \r\neducation for our girls — health, communications \r\nand information technology, and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, including particularly \r\nthe rights of women. Afghanistan has one of the \r\nmost dynamic media scenes in the region, propelled \r\nby the freedom of expression that the Afghan people \r\nhave enjoyed for more than a decade. We should also \r\nunderscore the pioneering spirit of our youth, who are \r\nbehind much of the innovativeness and diversity of \r\nthought in academia and in the private sector.\r\nThe Afghan people appreciate and thank the \r\ninternational community for the vital support that it has \r\ngiven the country to build security, peace and prosperity \r\nin Afghanistan. We look forward to continued mutual \r\ncooperation with the international community to \r\nprotect our achievements and ensure the sustainability \r\nof a strong partnership.\r\nThe transfer of security responsibilities from the \r\ninternational forces to the Afghan National Security \r\nForces for the whole of Afghanistan, launched in the \r\nsummer of 2011, will be achieved by the end of 2014. \r\n14-55132 25/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nAs we speak, Afghan forces are providing security \r\nindependently across the country, despite increasing \r\nacts of terrorism inside Afghanistan, which are being \r\ncommitted with support from terrorists from beyond \r\nour borders. The growing levels of violent extremism \r\nand the alarming developments in the Middle East and \r\nother parts of the world make international support \r\nfor the NATO mission in Afghanistan even more \r\nimperative.\r\nParallel to our ongoing efforts to enhance the \r\ncapacity and capabilities of our National Security \r\nForces, the Afghan Government is also pursuing a \r\ndialogue to achieve peace through political means and \r\nreconciliation. We have put in place clear conditions \r\nin order for that process to be accepted by the Afghan \r\npeople. For instance, we demand the renunciation of \r\nviolence and respect for Afghanistan’s Constitution, as \r\nit guarantees full and equal rights to Afghan men and \r\nwomen and is the only tool for the preservation of our \r\ncollective achievements of the past decade.\r\nAfghanistan strongly believes in comprehensive, \r\nlong-term, friendly and good-neighbourly relations \r\nbetween Pakistan and Afghanistan in the fight against \r\nterrorism and the strengthening of peace and stability \r\nbetween the two nations in the region. At the same time, \r\nwe would like to express our serious concern over the \r\nrocket attacks by Pakistani forces onto Afghanistan’s \r\nsoil. The continuation of such attacks is unacceptable \r\nto Afghanistan. We hope that the Government of \r\nPakistan, considering our common interests in ensuring \r\npeace and stability, will put an end to any kind of acts \r\nthat could endanger the prospects for good-neighbourly \r\nrelations and will act to protect cooperation and trust \r\nbetween our two nations.\r\nThe Afghan Government is keen to reduce the \r\nnegative economic impact of the security transition and \r\nto move towards sustainable economic development in \r\nat least three ways.\r\nFirst, we will focus on the development of \r\nagriculture and the agribusiness sector, where more \r\nthan 70 per cent of our population is directly or \r\nindirectly engaged, with enormous potential for growth \r\nand employment generation.\r\nSecondly, Afghanistan is estimated to hold trillions \r\nof dollars worth of natural resources, including minerals \r\nand hydrocarbons, representing a guaranteed source of \r\nwealth and income for generations to come. We already \r\nhave several State-owned and private companies from \r\nChina, India, the United Kingdom, Canada, Turkey, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan and other countries, \r\nin addition to Afghan companies, expressing a keen \r\ninterest in investing billions of dollars.\r\nThirdly, Afghanistan is now on the eve of a \r\ntransformative decade, from 2015-2024, which will \r\nbe a multidimensional process that will have security, \r\npolitical and economic ramifications. Therefore, \r\nthe pledges made at the 2012 Tokyo and Chicago \r\nConferences will maintain the Afghan Government’s \r\noverall socioeconomic efforts. Afghanistan critically \r\nneeds the continuation of that support from its \r\ninternational partners over the next few years.\r\nAfghanistan’s report on its progress in achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), published \r\nin late 2013, shows that the progress with regard to most \r\nof the MDG targets, in particular those related to health \r\nand universal primary education, is commendable. \r\nDespite only starting in 2005, Afghanistan is committed \r\nto achieving most of the MDGs by 2020. Meanwhile, \r\nnational consultations are under way to synchronize \r\nefforts towards achieving the off-track MDG targets, \r\nbearing in mind the outcome of the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nAs we embark on the important task of crafting \r\nthe new post-2015 development agenda at this session, \r\nI am happy to inform members that that process also \r\ncoincides with Afghanistan’s transformation decade. \r\nBoth are top priorities for Afghanistan’s national \r\ndevelopment agenda. We appreciate the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in recognizing the need to reduce \r\nthe number of sustainable development goals to an \r\naffordable, achievable and realistic number in the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. We are of the view that \r\nthat agenda should leave no one behind, it should be \r\nadaptable to both global and local settings, and it should \r\nhave sustainable development and poverty eradication \r\nat its centre.\r\nOur region is blessed with vast resources and \r\nopportunities for economic cooperation. An expanded \r\nlevel of regional cooperation can serve both economic and \r\nsecurity purposes. The Afghan Government’s regional \r\nstrategic goal for economic cooperation is to establish \r\nregional economic growth and resource corridors that \r\nconnect the Silk Road through Afghanistan, the people \r\nof South and Central Asia and the Middle East and their \r\nkey economic activities, including agriculture, light \r\nmanufacturing and mineral extraction, with essential \r\ntrade, transit and energy enablers.\r\n26/27 14-55132\r\nA/69/PV.16 27/09/2014\r\nRegional cooperation is one of our priorities. \r\nThe Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process represents a \r\nsignificant step towards enhancing stability and \r\nregional cooperation between Afghanistan and the \r\n12 participating countries, with the support of 12 other \r\ncountry partners and nine international organizations.\r\nThis year’s General Assembly session takes place \r\nat a time when the United Nations has seen a number \r\nof conflicts continue and new ones have taken shape. \r\nMy Government fully supports the inalienable rights \r\nof the Palestinian people and the establishment of \r\nan independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. We strongly condemn illegal actions \r\nand violations by the occupying Power against the \r\nPalestinians as a whole, especially the ongoing \r\ndisproportionate and indiscriminate attacks on innocent \r\nPalestinian civilians.\r\nWe express our grief at the killing of innocent \r\ncivilians in Syria and support a political resolution, \r\nreached through a broad-based national dialogue that \r\nmeets the aspirations of all Syrians. With the worsening \r\nsecurity situation in Iraq and Libya, we strongly \r\ncondemn the actions of the Islamic State of Iraq and the \r\nSham and its brutality, and we call for joint efforts to \r\ndefeat that evil. In that context, I call upon the United \r\nNations to take appropriate action within its mandate to \r\nuphold international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation believes that there is an urgent need \r\nfor the international community to pay attention to the \r\nresolution of the crisis in Ukraine, while taking into \r\naccount the situation of civilians.\r\nIn conclusion, let me assure members that \r\nAfghanistan remains committed to its national and \r\ninternational responsibilities and obligations. We \r\nreaffirm our strong will for a further strengthening of \r\ndemocracy and good governance, including a further \r\nstrengthening of the rule of law; accountability and \r\ntransparency; the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, particularly the rights of women; justice reforms; \r\nthe fight against terrorism, narcotic drugs, corruption; \r\nand the eradication of poverty. The support of the \r\ninternational community is essential for all of that.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting.\r\nSeveral members have asked to speak in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply. May I remind members that statements \r\nin the exercise of the right of reply are limited to \r\n10 minutes for the first statement and to five minutes \r\nfor the second, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Ansari Dogaheh (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\nshould like to exercise my right of reply in connection \r\nwith the remarks in the statement made earlier today \r\nby the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates \r\nin connection with the issue of the Iranian islands (see \r\nA/69/PV.15).\r\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nreiterates its full sovereignty over the Iranian islands \r\nof Abu Musa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb in the \r\nPersian Gulf and underlines that the decisions and \r\nmeasures undertaken in those islands by the Iranian \r\nauthorities have always been conducted on the basis \r\nof the principles of the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, any \r\nclaim to the contrary is deemed to be interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran and is \r\ncategorically rejected.\r\nThe Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nhas always pursued a policy of friendship and good-\r\nneighbourliness with all neighbouring countries. In that \r\ncontext, we once again express our readiness to engage \r\nin bilateral talks with the United Arab Emirates with a \r\nview to continuing to strengthen bilateral relations and \r\nremoving any misunderstanding that may exist between \r\nthe two countries in that regard. In the meantime, it is \r\nobvious that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran over the three islands is not \r\nnegotiable.\r\nMr. Diyar Khan (Pakistan): I should like to \r\nexercise my right of reply in connection with the \r\nremarks made by The Honourable Prime Minister of \r\nIndia (see A/69/PV.15).\r\nIn his statement today, the Prime Minister of India \r\nreferred to “Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”. To set the \r\nrecord straight, I should like to say that the correct \r\nand historic name of that territory is Azad Jammu and \r\nKashmir. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. Pakistan emphasizes the pursuit of \r\ndialogue and diplomacy, which are peaceful means for \r\nresolving issues and disputes. We believe that dialogue \r\nshould not be stalked by human rights violations or by \r\nany kind of terrorism.\r\nThe United Nations is the most appropriate forum \r\nin which to raise the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. As \r\nthe Prime Minister of Pakistan said yesterday, the right \r\n14-55132 27/27\r\n27/09/2014 A/69/PV.16\r\nto self-determination has to be exercised by the people \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nMr. Abhishek Singh (India): I take the f loor to \r\nexercise India’s right of reply.\r\nWe reject in their entirety the untenable comments \r\nby the representative of Pakistan. We would like to \r\nremind the representative of Pakistan of what our \r\nhonourable Prime Minister said today in this Hall:\r\n“I want to hold bilateral talks with [Pakistan]. \r\nHowever, it is also Pakistan’s responsibility to come \r\nforward and to genuinely establish the appropriate \r\natmosphere for bilateral talks. In raising that issue \r\nin this forum, I do not know how successful our \r\nefforts will be.” (A/69/PV.15, p. 17).\r\nMr. Diyar Khan (Pakistan): I exercise my second \r\nright of reply in response to the remarks just made by \r\nthe Indian representative.\r\nWith regard to the dialogue process, it is not \r\nPakistan that has stalled the dialogue process. Indeed, \r\nit was India that cancelled the dialogue with Pakistan \r\nat the Foreign Secretary level that was set to take place \r\nin August.\r\nWith regard to the issue of Jammu and Kashmir, let \r\nme once again reiterate that, no matter what the Indian \r\nrepresentative says, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir \r\nhas yet to be resolved in accordance with the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nWith regard to terrorism, I point out that Pakistan \r\nitself is the biggest victim of terrorism, which is planted \r\non our soil. Some of it is emanating from our immediate \r\nneighbourhood. Terrorism is a common threat, and we \r\nmust all work together to eliminate it.\r\nMr. Abhishek Singh (India): Regrettably, the \r\nPakistani representative has once again taken the f loor. \r\nWe reject all the untenable and unsolicited remarks \r\nfrom the representative of Pakistan.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
