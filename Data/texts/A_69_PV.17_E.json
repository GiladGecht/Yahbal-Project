Your election resulted from \r\nthe Member States’ recognition of the experience that \r\nthe Republic of Uganda has accumulated and of the \r\nincreasingly significant role that the African continent \r\nplays in the international community in consolidating \r\npeace and security worldwide. It also reflects your \r\nefforts to achieve sustainable development for the \r\ndeveloping countries, in addition to your outstanding \r\nprofessional qualifications, which testify to your \r\ntechnical knowledge and life experience. We are certain \r\nthat your diplomatic experience will greatly contribute \r\nto the favourable outcome of our work and help us to \r\ndiscover ways of resolving matters of major concern to \r\nthe international community. \r\nWe also welcome the important and relevant theme \r\nof this session, “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda, when properly \r\ndefined and structured, will certainly become a useful \r\ninstrument to guide developing countries, particularly \r\nthose of the African continent, to sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe wish to express our appreciation to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his competent, self less \r\nand zealous stewardship of the Organization. We \r\ncongratulate Mr. John William Ashe, who zealously \r\nand self lessly presided over the deliberations of the \r\nAssembly at the sixty-eighth session for the past \r\n12 months. \r\nThe pertinence of the theme chosen for the sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly is clear in \r\nthe light of the persisting economic and financial \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.17\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n17th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 29 September 2014, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\ncrisis that continues to ravage the world. We must \r\ncombine our efforts and focus them on building the \r\nmore just and auspicious future to which our peoples \r\nlegitimately aspire. To that end, Africa has identified \r\nthe six pillars on which its sustainable development \r\nshould rest: structural economic transformation and \r\ninclusive growth; science, technology and innovation; \r\npeople-centred development; environmental \r\nsustainability, natural resources management and \r\ndisaster management; peace and security; and finance \r\nand partnerships. \r\nFrom our perspective, those pillars emanate from \r\nthe aspirations of our African nations. All partners of \r\nthe African continent should take them into account \r\nin the arduous efforts to bring about sustainable and \r\nequitable development and enhance the dignity of our \r\npeoples. Therefore, Sao Tome and Principe believes in \r\nsustainable development in Africa, based on the pillars \r\nproposed by the African Union. It calls on the United \r\nNations to adapt its programme to the specific realities \r\nof Africa, without losing sight of the accomplishments \r\nof certain countries in attaining some of the eight \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIt is an indisputable fact that the raison d’être of \r\nthe United Nations is to maintain peace and security \r\naround the world, which is a sine qua non for the \r\npromotion of development. However, in the light of \r\nthe significant changes that the world has undergone \r\nsince the establishment of our Organization in 1945, \r\nwe must stress the urgent need to adapt it to the new \r\nchallenges of our time. Therefore, we again reiterate \r\nour call for the acceleration of the ongoing process of \r\nreform throughout the entire United Nations system, in \r\norder to imbue its operations with greater dynamism, \r\nrepresentativeness, effectiveness, capacity and \r\nlegitimacy, thereby leadingto the maintenance of peace \r\nand security and thus to the promotion of development \r\nworldwide.\r\nWe unfortunately continue to observe the persistence \r\nof some conflict areas and the outbreak of new \r\ntensions, with alarmingly significant humanitarian \r\nrepercussions, throughout the world. In Mali and in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, despite the relative \r\nstabilization of conflict zones as a result of United \r\nNations efforts, we think that the combined operations \r\nmust continue in order to consolidate and strengthen \r\nthe achievements. \r\nWe are grateful for the resolution of the situation \r\nin Guinea-Bissau, where the transition process has \r\nled to the election of a new President of the Republic \r\nand a new Government, thereby repositioning the \r\ncountry in accordance with regular and institutional \r\ndemocratic processes. However, it is incumbent on \r\nthe international community, particularly the United \r\nNations, the African Union, the Economic Community \r\nof West African States (ECOWAS) and the Community \r\nof Portuguese-speaking Countries, to continue to \r\ncollaborate and combine their efforts to consolidate \r\nthe democratic rule of law so that our sister nation may \r\nadvance the progress and well-being of its people.\r\nIt is with enormous and fraternal satisfaction that \r\nwe commend the political actors in Mozambique for \r\ntheir great maturity and for taking into account the \r\nhigher interests of their people by recently signing a \r\npeace agreement, thereby avoiding more suffering and \r\nloss of human lives.\r\nWith regard to the Central African Republic, we \r\nwelcome the decision of the United Nations to dispatch \r\nthe Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \r\nin the Central African Republic to end the suffering \r\nof that country’s people and clear the way for national \r\nreconciliation. The reconciliation process began with \r\nthe recent Brazzaville forum and should be completed \r\nby the Bangui forum and the holding of elections. These \r\nshould open a window of opportunity for the resolution \r\nof the disturbing crisis in the Central African Republic, \r\nwhich is in our subregion, and enable it to return to \r\ninstitutional normalcy.\r\nWith respect to South Sudan, we encourage \r\nefforts to convince the conflicting parties to engage \r\nin negotiations with a view to seeking solutions for \r\ntheir existing differences and ending the suffering of \r\ninnocent civilians. In Western Sahara, the long-standing \r\nsituation continues to be a matter of concern for us and \r\nto require a greater involvement from the international \r\ncommunity so that the long negotiation process can \r\nfinally be completed. Therefore, we renew our call for \r\nthe involved parties to return to the negotiating table in \r\norder to reach a mutually acceptable political solution.\r\nIn the light of the resurgence of acts of international \r\nterrorism everywhere, it is imperative for all the \r\nmembers of the international community to coordinate \r\ntheir actions, since that is the only way the world will \r\nbe able to overcome that scourge. To that end, we wish \r\nto note our apprehension and express our concern \r\n14-55181 3/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nwith regard to the actions perpetrated by Boko Haram \r\nin our neighbour, the Republic of Nigeria, and the \r\nconsequences of such actions. Nigeria is a country \r\nwith which Sao Tome and Principe maintains ties of \r\nfriendship and multiple relations of understanding and \r\ncooperation in areas of common interest. \r\nWe are also troubled by the recent phenomenon of \r\nthe Islamic State and its implications. The Middle East, \r\nunfortunately, continues on the path of bloody conflicts. \r\nThese have taken an enormous number of human \r\nlives, owing to the long-standing hostilities between \r\nIsrael and Palestine, whose devastating consequences \r\nthe world recently witnessed. Therefore, we welcome \r\nthe recent ceasefire between the two parties, and we \r\nrenew our call for a negotiated solution that will ensure \r\nthe Palestinian people’s right to control their own \r\ndestiny, as well as the State of Israel’s right to exist, in \r\naccordance with the relevant resolutions.\r\nSimilarly, there is no military solution for the \r\npersistent internal conflict in Syria, which has also \r\ncreated disastrous humanitarian consequences. \r\nTherefore, we welcome the recent ceasefire between \r\nthe parties and renew our call for a compromise to be \r\nreached, with the help and support of the international \r\ncommunity, in order to end the hostilities and clear the \r\nway for a frank dialogue across the negotiating table \r\nand a political solution for lasting peace.\r\nAs to the conflict in Ukraine, which is also \r\ncausing the loss of many human lives, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe regrets the situation \r\nand calls on the parties to move forward rapidly, \r\nthrough dialogue, in resolving their differences. The \r\ninternational community must make all efforts to \r\nfacilitate such dialogue.\r\nWe believe that the Assembly will agree with us when \r\nwe say that global security is vital for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our countries. Therefore, considering \r\nthat Sao Tome and Principe is centrally located in the \r\nGulf of Guinea, a region that is strongly affected by \r\npiracy, terrorism, drug trafficking and other illicit acts \r\ncommitted at sea, we have taken national steps to fight \r\nthose phenomena, including the drafting of a legislative \r\nframework for the modernization of the armed forces, \r\nbased on a strategy that focuses decisively on the sea \r\nand its resources.\r\nAt the subregional level, we have worked, as \r\npart of the tripartite partnership of ECOWAS, the \r\nEconomic Community of Central African States and \r\nthe Gulf of Guinea Commission, to implement the \r\nrecommendations of the Summit of Heads of State \r\nand Government on Maritime Safety and Security \r\nin the Gulf of Guinea, held in Yaoundé. To that end, \r\nwe welcome the progress achieved in the process of \r\nestablishing the Interregional Coordination Centre, \r\nwhich is scheduled to begin operations very soon, and \r\nwe renew our call to the international community to \r\ncontinue with us on the arduous task of ensuring our \r\ncollective security.\r\nWe strongly believe that taking steps to reduce the \r\nharmful effects of climate change is a responsibility that \r\nmust be shared by developing countries and developed \r\ncountries alike, in order to ensure the continuity of the \r\nclean development mechanism, particularly for the least \r\ndeveloped countries, as well as to mobilize the political \r\nwill for a legally binding global agreement through the \r\nadoption of the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change at the twenty-first Conference of \r\nthe Parties, scheduled to take place in Paris in 2015.\r\nThe trade embargo imposed against Cuba decades \r\nago constitutes another matter of great concern for us, \r\nand we therefore renew our call for the sanctions to be \r\nlifted. Cuba should be allowed to address its economic \r\nand social development challenges in an environment \r\nof normalcy, without the restrictions imposed by such \r\nsanctions, and to take better advantage of opportunities \r\nfor trade relations on an equal footing with other States \r\nMembers of our Organization.\r\nThe African continent is once again assailed by an \r\nepidemic of haemorrhagic fever caused by the Ebola \r\nvirus, with incalculable consequences. In the light of \r\nthe high level of mortality and the devastating effects \r\nof the disease, on the one hand, and the chance that it \r\nmay spread to other areas of the world, on the other \r\nhand, we must urgently identify synergies to engage in \r\nan all-out struggle to save the thousands of lives that \r\nare threatened by this terrible scourge.\r\nIn Sao Tome and Principe, we fortunately have \r\nnot yet seen any Ebola cases. However, in the light \r\nof our country’s vulnerability, our economic and \r\nfinancial weaknesses, and our health institutions’ lack \r\nof experience in dealing with the outbreak, we have \r\nprepared a contingency plan and taken prevention and \r\nresponse measures, including entry and exit restrictions \r\nat our ports and airports, which may impact our fragile \r\neconomy. Members will understand that we must count \r\non the World Health Organization’s help and on the \r\n4/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nsupport and experience of friendly nations in order to \r\nprotect our population against all sources and forms \r\nof contamination. In that regard, we welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative in convening a high-\r\nlevel meeting on the margins of this session in order to \r\ndiscuss the matter and take appropriate measures.\r\nBefore I finish my statement, please allow me \r\nto note the situation of calm and progress between \r\nthe two sides on the Taiwan Strait. We welcome that \r\nenvironment and encourage the parties to develop their \r\nrelations through negotiations. Our country is pleased \r\nto see the participation of the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan in the General Assembly of the World Health \r\nOrganization and applauds the fact that Taiwan was \r\ninvited, for the first time since 1971, to participate \r\nin the Assembly of the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization in 2013.\r\nTherefore, and considering the enormous potential \r\nof Taiwan, we would like to see its participation \r\nfurther extend to other specialized agencies of \r\nthe United Nations, such as the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, and to the \r\nimplementation process of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, in which it could be of significant help to the \r\ninternational community.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our country’s willingness \r\nto continue to participate in the efforts to mobilize \r\nwills and facilitate synergies for the achievement of the \r\nbasic principles and noble objectives that guided the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations.\r\nIt is certain that today we are a democratic country \r\nwith a community of free citizens, but challenges will \r\ncontinue to arise in the future. Therefore, we have taken \r\nsteps to consolidate democracy, so that our citizens \r\nmay have an increasingly aware and active involvement \r\nin our collective existence and the political debate may \r\nbe broader and more responsible. It is hoped that these \r\nsteps will enable compromises among all the political \r\nforces to be achieved and to serve as the basis for the \r\nreforms that our country needs. We are fully aware that \r\nour country’s economic performance hinges on political \r\nstability and our citizens’ trust in our democratic \r\ninstitutions.\r\nI cannot conclude without informing the Assembly \r\nthat Sao Tome and Principe will hold long-awaited \r\nlegislative, regional and local elections on 12 October. \r\nThe electoral process is being managed in an \r\nenvironment of full normality, and we have resolved \r\nthe financial difficulties related to the elections with \r\nthe generous support of our development partners, to \r\nwhich we express our profound gratitude and esteem. \r\nWe expect the election results to be transparent and \r\nfair, as our tradition dictates, and that our country \r\nwill continue to be a benchmark of democracy in our \r\nsubregion.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Gabriel Arcanjo Ferreira da Costa, Prime \r\nMinister of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Manuel Vicente, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Angola\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nAngola.\r\nMr. Manuel Vicente, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Angola, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Manuel Vicente, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Angola, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Vicente (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe Government of the Republic of Angola, allow me \r\nto congratulate you, Mr. Sam Kutesa, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession, and to assure you of my country’s support as \r\nyou fulfil your mission. I would also like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador John William Ashe for the competent \r\nmanner in which he led the work of the previous \r\nsession. We extend our greetings to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon and commend him for his commitment to \r\nfinding solutions to the issues facing the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly is taking \r\nplace in an environment that gives rise to concern \r\ndue to the aggravation of international tensions, the \r\nintensification of conflicts and the deepening of global \r\ncrises that require effective and sustainable solutions. \r\nIt is a matter of consensus that the solutions to common \r\nchallenges are to be found in multilateral negotiations \r\nand should take into account the specificities of each \r\n14-55181 5/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\ncountry and each people. The United Nations has \r\nalways been and will continue to be the mainstay of \r\nMember States’ participation in decision-making on \r\nissues of concern to the international community and \r\nin upholding the global values of tolerance and peaceful \r\nand harmonious coexistence of countries and peoples, \r\nin accordance with the principles set forth in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law.\r\nAngola would once again like to reiterate the \r\nimportance of all Member States joining in efforts \r\nto make the United Nations a strong and effective \r\norganization, and one that serves as the basis for a more \r\nbalanced, fair and inclusive international legal order \r\nand global security system, while promoting confidence \r\namong States and strengthening relations of friendship \r\nand international cooperation. Our Organization should \r\npay special attention to the resurgence of armed conflicts \r\nand their negative effects on populations, as well as to \r\narms f lows, trafficking in drugs and human beings, \r\ntransnational organized crime, international terrorism \r\nand piracy — all phenomena that have an adverse \r\nimpact on economic development and consequently \r\nimpede the improvement of living conditions.\r\nReligious fundamentalism in some African \r\ncountries is taking on such violent proportions that \r\nit poses a threat to regional security, with serious \r\nconsequences for peace, stability and development. \r\nAngola strongly condemns the acts committed by \r\nterrorist groups and expresses its support for efforts to \r\nensure the full neutralization of those groups. Angola \r\nsupports efforts to strengthen the crisis-management \r\ncapacity of the United Nations and considers dialogue \r\nand negotiation to be the best means of resolving \r\nconflicts.\r\nWe will continue to meet our international \r\nobligations, with special emphasis on the African \r\ncontinent and the regional groupings in which we \r\noperate, including the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity, the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States, the African countries that use Portuguese \r\nas an official language, the Gulf of Guinea Commission \r\nand the International Conference on the Great Lakes \r\nRegion, with a view to defining mechanisms and forms \r\nof cooperation with the United Nations, the African \r\nUnion, the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries and other international partners.\r\nAngola assumed the rotating presidency of the \r\nInternational Conference on the Great Lakes Region \r\nin January, and in that forum continues to promote the \r\nresolution of conflicts on the African continent with a \r\nview to attaining stability, political and institutional \r\ndevelopment, internal and border security, good \r\ngovernance and human rights. It is in that context \r\nthat Angola is engaged in the peace processes in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African \r\nRepublic and the Great Lakes region.\r\nThe Ebola epidemic is an issue of great concern. \r\nThe position of the Security Council, which declared \r\nthe epidemic to be a threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity, fully reflects the seriousness of the situation. \r\nA decisive commitment on the part of the international \r\ncommunity is required if the scourge is to be combated \r\nand eradicated.\r\nWe reiterate the need to reform and revitalize the \r\nUnited Nations system, in particular the need to reform \r\nthe Security Council, which should be brought into \r\nline with the current international context and whose \r\nmembership should reflect an equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation through an increase in the number of \r\npermanent members. Angola reiterates the right of the \r\nAfrican continent to sit among the permanent members \r\nof the Council.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the lack of \r\nprogress in finding a lasting solution are a major cause \r\nof widespread instability in the Middle East, and \r\nalso the root cause of the resurgence of terrorism in \r\nthe region. That situation worries the Government of \r\nAngola. We call for political will and f lexibility from \r\nboth parties, and we encourage the Secretary-General \r\nand the United States Secretary of State to continue \r\ntheir mediation efforts with a view to establishing a \r\nsovereign and independent Palestinian State, as well as \r\na modus vivendi to ensure that the two States coexist \r\nin peace and security within internationally recognized \r\nborders.\r\nThe impasse in resolving the question of Western \r\nSahara continues to delay the exercise of the right \r\nto self-determination of the people of that territory. \r\nAngola calls on the parties to continue negotiations \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations and the \r\nAfrican Union in order to find a solution in accordance \r\nwith the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand resolution 1514 (XV) of December 1960.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Ukraine, Angola \r\ndeplores the loss of human lives caused by instability \r\n6/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nin the region and calls for dialogue between the parties \r\ninvolved to find a political solution to the conflict.\r\nThe situations in Somalia and South Sudan \r\nremain cause for concern. However, there has been \r\nsome encouraging progress, which is why we urge \r\nthe authorities in those countries and the international \r\ncommunity to continue their efforts for stabilization. \r\nAngola welcomes the constitutional normalization in \r\nsome African countries. We welcome the holding of \r\ndemocratic elections in Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar \r\nand Egypt, and we express our solidarity with the \r\nnational reconciliation and reconstruction processes \r\nand the economic and social development in those \r\ncountries.\r\nThe Government of Angola expresses its \r\nappreciation for the choice of the central theme of \r\nthis session, “Delivering on and implementing a \r\ntransformative post-2015 development agenda”. It is \r\ngreatly relevance, especially for the least developed \r\ncountries. The progress made in some of those \r\ncountries is far behind the targets of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, due to structural issues, and is \r\ninsufficient to mitigate the persistent effects of the \r\neconomic problems.\r\nWith one year remaining until the final assessment \r\nof the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, our economies continue to suffer the effects of \r\nthe international economic and financial crisis, which \r\ncreate barriers to economic growth and hinder the \r\nimplementation of programmes to combat poverty and \r\nimprove the living conditions of our peoples. However, \r\nwe note with satisfaction that the African continent \r\nhas ceased to present the image of desolation it did at \r\nthe beginning of the millennium. A new reality has \r\nemerged in which African countries boast an average \r\ngrowth of 5 per cent per year and improvements in \r\nseveral human development indicators. We believe that \r\nthe trend of progress will prevail in the near future, \r\nand we will do everything to make it so by investing in \r\nfuture generations on the basis of the objectives of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development, the post-\r\n2015 road map and the African Agenda 2063.\r\nAngola is implementing its National Development \r\nPlan 2013-2017, which aims to increase the supply of \r\nsocial services to the population, diversify the economy \r\nand consolidate macroeconomic stability, thus laying \r\nthe foundation for the process of graduation to a \r\nmiddle-income country.\r\nAngola reiterates the need to end the economic and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed on Cuba, which limits the \r\nright of the Cuban people to development and is a clear \r\nviolation of the principles and rules of international law.\r\nMr. Mnisi (Swaziland), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nFinally, we appreciate and have been touched by \r\nthe support that Angola has received from numerous \r\ncountries for its candidature to be a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council for the 2015-2016 \r\nbiennium, elections for which will place during the \r\nAssembly’s present session. Once elected to that \r\nimportant organ, we will work with partners in the \r\nCouncil to seek solutions to the serious problems \r\nfacing the international community and to make a real \r\ncontribution to peace and security in the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Angola for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Manuel Vicente, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Angola, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland.\r\nMr. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Barnabas Sibusiso \r\nDlamini, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, \r\nand inviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is a great honour for \r\nme to address the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession on behalf of His Majesty King Mswati III, \r\nHead of State of the Kingdom of eSwatini. I convey \r\nthe congratulations and best wishes of His Majesty the \r\nKing and the people of the Kingdom of eSwatini to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession, a son of Africa. We commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff for the good work they are doing \r\nin creating an enabling environment for all humankind \r\nto live in peace despite the multiple challenges facing \r\nthe world.\r\n14-55181 7/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nAs we gather here, we are very mindful of the \r\nnew challenge that confronts the global community \r\nfollowing the outbreak of Ebola in some parts of the \r\nAfrican continent. That disease is claiming hundreds of \r\nlives and diverting focus and resources from essential \r\ndevelopment initiatives. It is also a serious drawback \r\nto the attainment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and is a threat to humankind. We urge the United \r\nNations and its Members to spare no effort in providing \r\nall the necessary assistance at its disposal to curb the \r\ndisease and prevent any further loss of life.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to thank the \r\nGeneral Assembly for convening the high-level plenary \r\nmeeting known as the World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples. It was particularly opportune, as indigenous \r\nknowledge and practices substantially contribute to the \r\nsustainable development agenda.\r\nLast week the General Assembly held its twenty-\r\nninth special session, on follow-up to the Programme \r\nof Action of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development beyond 2014. My delegation was \r\npleased to participate in that event. We reaffirm the \r\nKingdom’s commitment to the Programme of Action, \r\nwhich is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago.\r\nThis year the regular session of the General \r\nAssembly was preceded by the Climate Summit, at \r\nwhich Heads of State and Government deliberated on \r\nissues of environmental protection. Those issues are \r\ncritical to the achievement of sustainable development, \r\nparticularly for the developing countries. We are \r\npleased that the Summit was able to mobilize sufficient \r\npolitical support for guiding the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held in Lima in December. \r\nThe issue of climate change is crucial for many of our \r\ndeveloping economies, especially on the continent of \r\nAfrica. It has a direct effect on our national objective to \r\nproduce enough food for ourselves. The unpredictable \r\nweather conditions continue to be of great concern to \r\nour farmers. We shall continue to call upon the United \r\nNations to expedite the issue to prevent further adverse \r\neffects on our lives.\r\nThe theme of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session is “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”. It \r\nresonates well with our call for a development agenda \r\nthat is inclusive. It is a clear indication that we are \r\ntranscending the era of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, entering a new chapter of the development \r\nagenda. As we set the stage for the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, my delegation is heartened to see \r\nthat we have not forgotten our collective inability to \r\nmeet all the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nI commend the co-Chairs of the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals for the \r\nmanner in which they ably guided the proceedings of \r\nthe Group. We welcome the outcome document of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (A/68/970) and the goals and targets contained \r\ntherein. The Kingdom of eSwatini is pleased that the \r\nframework for the post-2015 development agenda has \r\ntaken into account those Millennium Development \r\nGoals that have not yet been met, especially the \r\neradication of poverty. As we begin a new era, let \r\nus not forget our previous commitments, and let us \r\ncontinue to emphasize the urgency for the developed \r\npartners to honour their official development assistance \r\ncommitments.\r\nFood security remains a critical challenge for the \r\nAfrican continent, and we wish to reiterate our call \r\nfor the provision of adequate financial resources, the \r\ntransfer of environmentally sound technologies and \r\ntechnical assistance to developing countries if we are \r\nto achieve our development goals. We have abundant \r\nresources on the continent. However, there is a great \r\nneed for value addition to our products in order to \r\nmaximize our food-production initiatives.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini continues to set aside \r\na sizeable budget for agriculture. Due to the negative \r\neffects of climate change, we have a programme to \r\nconstruct dams for irrigation throughout the Kingdom. \r\nAssistance to subsistence farmers with farming inputs \r\nhas also been increased with the intention of increasing \r\ntheir yields and thus increasing food production in the \r\nKingdom.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini fully supports the \r\nAfrican Union’s road map for development, Agenda \r\n2063, which is critical to attaining the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We are confident that, with United \r\nNations support, that approach will accelerate Africa’s \r\nregional economic integration agenda and help realize \r\nit, facilitate integration in the world economy and \r\nultimately improve the continent’s living standards.\r\nAfrica is home to the majority of the world’s fastest-\r\ngrowing economies, and trade remains an integral \r\npart of the development agenda. Focus is now on \r\n8/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nsustaining that growth through boosting intra-African \r\ntrade and establishing the continental free trade area. \r\nIt is important, however, that access to the global \r\nmarkets remain open to mutually beneficial conditions \r\nthat promote the United Nations ideals of increased \r\ninternational cooperation and trade.\r\nWe are encouraged by the renewed commitment for \r\nthe economic development of the African continent as \r\nresolved in different summits. The continent abounds \r\nwith investment opportunities in different sectors, \r\nsuch as infrastructure, information, communication, \r\ntechnology and energy, to name but a few. That will, \r\nno doubt, have a huge impact on the sustainable \r\ndevelopment programmes for the continent. It will also \r\ncontribute handsomely to job creation, particularly for \r\nthe youth.\r\nWe should ensure that the post-2015 agenda is \r\ncognizant of the special development needs of developing \r\ncountries, particularly those in Africa. We also give \r\nparticular recognition to those developing countries \r\nthat have special challenges due to their geographical \r\nposition, such as small island developing States and \r\nlandlocked developing countries. My delegation hopes \r\nthat the agenda will also take into consideration the \r\nspecial plight of middle-income countries, where the \r\nmajority of the world’s poor reside.\r\nThe Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini is \r\npleased to note that the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\ncontinues to contribute to global issues, and the \r\npositive developments taking place in that region are \r\nencouraging. We encourage their full participation in \r\nall United Nations structures.\r\nAs we meet here, in some parts of the world people \r\nare living in fear as every day thousands of human \r\nbeings, especially vulnerable groups, are losing their \r\nlives to terrorists. We encourage the United Nations to \r\ntake a leading role in promoting peace and coexistence \r\nin the world. We call on all those who are fighting \r\nto find a lasting, peaceful solution to their problems \r\nthrough dialogue and not through the barrel of a gun.\r\nIn conclusion, the Kingdom of eSwatini would like \r\nto commend the United Nations and related agencies \r\nfor being a key factor in helping to overcome the \r\nmany complex challenges facing the world today. We \r\nreiterate our call for peaceful solutions and dialogue \r\nin all conflict situations so that the United Nations \r\nmay achieve its noble objectives. We take pride in and \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the principles and ideals \r\ncontained in the Charter of the United Nations. May the \r\nAlmighty God bless us all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Domingos Simões Pereira, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Domingos Simões Pereira, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Domingos Simões \r\nPereira, Prime Minister of the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Pereira (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf of \r\nthe President of the Republic, Mr. José Mário Vaz, and \r\non my own behalf, and in the name of the State and \r\npeople of Guinea-Bissau, I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa on his election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. His \r\nelection by this most representative institution of the \r\ninternational system is a tribute not only to his country, \r\nUganda, but to the entire African continent. I welcome \r\nhim and wish him success in guiding the work of the \r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are grateful to the United Nations, and to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon in particular, for \r\nthe attention given to Guinea-Bissau and for the \r\nimportant contribution of the Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General in our country to our political \r\nnormalization process. We would also like to say a \r\nspecial word of appreciation to the former Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, President \r\nRamos-Horta, for his friendship with Guinea-Bissau \r\nand his dedication to his mission.\r\n14-55181 9/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nWe express our appreciation to and thank the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, its Government \r\nand people. When they saw the need of their sister \r\nnation of Guinea-Bissau, they extended the hand of \r\nfriendship and provided valuable and extraordinary \r\nsupport to our country in dealing with our crisis, for \r\nwhich the entire nation of Guinea-Bissau is grateful.\r\nThe subregion contributed financial support \r\nin helping our Government to function, which has \r\nbeen key in enabling us to reach the point where we \r\nfind ourselves today. We would like to express our \r\nappreciation and acknowledgement to the forces of \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\nMission (ECOWAS) in Guinea-Bissau, who carried \r\nout their mission with professionalism and ensured a \r\npeaceful and orderly transition. Similarly, we commend \r\nthe efforts of all our national political actors and \r\ninternational partners to reach the consensus required \r\nto maintain an international stabilization force after the \r\nend of the Mission’s mandate.\r\nWe would like to acknowledge and thank all the \r\nmember countries of ECOWAS for their support, in \r\nparticular my friend and brother President Goodluck \r\nJonathan of Nigeria, who chaired the Contact Group \r\non Guinea-Bissau and provided additional and valuable \r\nsupport to our country. I pray for peace and tranquillity \r\nfor his country and for the welfare of his people. We are \r\nalso deeply grateful to President Alpha Condé of Guinea, \r\nwho mediated the crisis in Guinea-Bissau. Finally, we \r\nwould like to express our profound acknowledgement \r\nand gratitude to all our international partners — the \r\nUnited Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries and its \r\nmember States, the European Union, the West African \r\nEconomic and Monetary Union and the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie, whose support was \r\nimportant in monitoring and managing the political \r\ntransition process, as well as in holding free, transparent \r\nand fair general elections in our country.\r\nI would also like to share with the Assembly \r\nthat Guinea-Bissau’s society has renewed its hope in \r\na new political cycle and to assure it that we possess \r\nthe political will and deep commitment needed to \r\nconsolidate political stability, revitalize and strengthen \r\nthe State’s capacity and create the basic conditions that \r\nwill enable our people to realize their dreams.\r\nGuinea-Bissau is a post-conflict State with fragile \r\ninstitutions and scarce financial resources, suffering \r\nfrom the severe political, economic, environmental and \r\nsocial consequences of our crisis. We therefore face a \r\ncomplex and difficult situation, in which we call on the \r\ninternational community for assistance, that will be \r\nessential if we are to stabilize our country in this post-\r\nelection period and achieve our goals of strengthening \r\nthe State’s institutional capacity, reducing our people’s \r\npoverty and vulnerabilities, ensuring social stability, \r\nlegitimizing the Government, and relaunching our \r\neconomy. That approach to international assistance, \r\nat the centre of our dialogue with our international \r\npartners, is based on the Government’s agenda, which \r\nincludes three key programmes: Urgent, Contingency \r\nand Medium-Term Development.\r\nUnder the Urgent Programme, we must ensure \r\nfood safety and social stability through support for \r\nagricultural production and distribution, improve access \r\nto food and income for some sectors of the population, \r\nprovide the population with basic health, education and \r\nwater and power supply services, and pay civil servants’ \r\noverdue salaries. It also includes an emergency health \r\naction plan for preventing and responding to the threat \r\nof an Ebola epidemic. The Contingency Programme’s \r\nobjective is essentially to ensure the transparency \r\nand accountability of all natural-resource concession \r\nand exploitation agreements and to end the nefarious \r\nprocedures that allowed our country’s forestry and \r\nfishery resources to be plundered over the past two \r\nyears. The Medium-Term Development Programme \r\nwill be presented to our international partners at a \r\ndonor conference to be held at the end of this year or \r\nearly next, and for which we are requesting the essential \r\nsupport of the United Nations and all our multilateral \r\nand bilateral partners.\r\nAs we embark on the challenge of rebuilding \r\nGuinea-Bissau anew, we are fully conscious of the \r\nproblems but filled with a patriotic spirit of collective \r\ndrive and unity joining all Bissau-Guineans and, in \r\nparticular, all political actors and sovereign institutions, \r\nwith full confidence in an inclusive Government that \r\nincorporates all political parties represented in our \r\nParliament, as well as civil society and the diaspora. \r\nThis confidence was significantly enhanced by our \r\nnational Parliament’s recent unanimous approval of the \r\nGovernment’s programme, which is unprecedented in \r\nthe history of our democracy.\r\nWhile it is true that the ongoing process of political \r\nstabilization and normalization of the democratic \r\ninstitutions in Guinea-Bissau depends on a major \r\n10/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nnational effort, it will also require unequivocal and \r\nurgent support from our regional and international \r\npartners. We must structure and coordinate our actions \r\nbased on the goals established in the Government’s \r\nprogramme in order to lay the foundations for our \r\ncountry to change course and become viable.\r\nIn this context, three situations demonstrate how \r\nimperative it is for us to combine our efforts. The first \r\nis the ongoing process of defence and security sector \r\nreform, including extensive steps taken in recent days \r\ntowards its reorganization. We need international \r\nsupport in order to make those steps sustainable and \r\nirreversible. The second is the extension of the State’s \r\npresence throughout the national territory in an effective \r\nand organized manner through decentralization and \r\nlocal elections. The Government will lay the foundations \r\nfor the municipal administrations to become operational \r\nand will adopt the national territory organization policy. \r\nThe third is the extremely complex task of combating \r\ndrug trafficking and organized crime. Our country’s \r\nefforts will be successful only through a collective and \r\nobjective approach.\r\nGuinea-Bissau needs a robust and impactful \r\nintervention from our development partners in order \r\nnot only to consolidate the success of our political \r\ntransition but also to lay the foundations for a transition \r\nto development. We request the reactivation of the \r\nInternational Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations, for the purpose of \r\nmonitoring the domestic situation in our country and \r\nsupporting the mobilization of international aid, which \r\nis key for us to face the challenges in our future.\r\nThe new authorities in Guinea-Bissau, our \r\nParliament, the President of the Republic and our \r\nGovernment chose an inclusive dialogue and political \r\ncoordination as the preferred tools in our efforts \r\nto consolidate political stability and create broad \r\nconsensus around the main thrusts of governance. \r\nTherefore, in addition to strengthening the democratic \r\nlegitimacy of our political institutions, we wish to \r\ntake clear, unequivocal and decisive steps to build \r\nbroad consensus on the main issues facing our society. \r\nThey would be anchored in a political protocol that \r\nestablishes the main areas of legislative and executive \r\naction, including issues related to reforming the State, \r\nrevising the Constitution and rebuilding the economy. \r\nA sign of this power-sharing vision for the resolution \r\nof our main problems is the inclusion of the opposition \r\nleader in our delegation to the United Nations, in order \r\nto show the world that Guinea-Bissau has embarked on \r\na path of harmony and stability.\r\nOur subregion, West Africa, is facing an Ebola \r\nepidemic, which directly threatens several members \r\nof ECOWAS, to which we belong. Allow me to offer \r\nGuinea-Bissau’s solidarity to our sister nations where \r\ncases of contamination have been identified. I would \r\nlike to note our appreciation for the international efforts \r\nin providing urgent medical assistance and to call on \r\nthe international community to step up its commitment \r\nand support in combating and preventing this epidemic. \r\nWe also appeal for the establishment of an effective \r\ninternational coalition to confront this grave threat to \r\ninternational security, which was recently recognized \r\nas such by the Security Council.\r\nI reaffirm my country’s position on reforming the \r\nSecurity Council. The enlargement of this important \r\nUnited Nations body is required in order to enhance the \r\nlegitimacy of its representation and to reflect the new \r\ninternational order under discussion. Therefore, and in \r\naccordance with the African Union’s position, Guinea-\r\nBissau calls for the designation of two permanent seats \r\nwith the right of veto and five non-permanent seats in \r\nthe Security Council for the African continent. We also \r\nvoice our support for the designation of permanent seats \r\non the Security Council for Brazil, Japan, Germany and \r\nIndia.\r\nI would like to assure the peoples and countries \r\nthat have fallen victim to international terrorism of our \r\nsolidarity and to renew our Government’s commitment \r\nto combating this scourge within a framework of \r\ncoordinated actions undertaken jointly with our \r\nregional and international partners, according to the \r\nspecific nature of the actions.\r\nWe note with concern that the economic and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed against Cuba more than \r\n50 years ago constitutes a serious obstacle to that \r\ncountry’s economic and social development, and we \r\nreiterate our call for it to be lifted.\r\nWe commend and encourage the United Nations, \r\nand in particular the Secretary-General, for their \r\nrenewed efforts, vision and wisdom with regard to the \r\nissue of climate change and its effects on life on our \r\nplanet. The Climate Summit held here on 23 September \r\nwas an eloquent testament to this fact. The main areas \r\nthat may allow for viable and sustainable development \r\nemerged and seem likely to gather the required \r\nconsensus for the establishment of a post-Kyoto global \r\n14-55181 11/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nclimate regime designed to promote the well-being of \r\nall.\r\nSustainable development goals, the new post-\r\n2015 global development paradigm, must be rooted in \r\nthe peoples’ cultures and objective realities and must \r\nundoubtedly draw their inspiration from the lessons of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nIt should be noted that climate change is no longer \r\nsimply a future threat; it has now become an unequivocal \r\nthreat to the present. The rising incidence of climate \r\nchange that exposes our vulnerabilities is now felt and \r\nhas increasingly unpredictable consequences. Human, \r\neconomic and environmental losses in a vulnerable \r\ncountry such as Guinea-Bissau are increasing and \r\nthreaten our survival and development prospects.\r\nSea-level rise may irreversibly affect coastal areas, \r\nincluding entire islands, villages, cities and other seaside \r\nsettlements. This situation is particularly worrisome \r\nfor our country, which, with its combination of coasts \r\nand archipelagos, is highly vulnerable to the impacts \r\nof climate events and may see its efforts to combat \r\npoverty and achieve development goals compromised.\r\nDespite all the difficulties that have challenged \r\nGuinea-Bissau’s efforts to fulfil our international \r\ncommitments holistically, we are pleased to note that \r\n12 per cent of our national territory consists of protected \r\nareas, which should double by 2020. Unfortunately, \r\nmost of the population in developing countries with \r\nforests, such as Guinea-Bissau, continues to depend on \r\nthese natural resources as their only means of survival. \r\nTherefore, in order to offset the possible loss of those \r\nresources, technological and financial alternatives must \r\nbe made available to this population.\r\nI conclude my statement by thanking the United \r\nNations and expressing our deep appreciation for the \r\nsignificant role that the Peacebuilding Commission has \r\nplayed in supporting the consolidation of political and \r\ngovernance stability in Guinea-Bissau. I also recognize \r\nthe United Nations bodies, including the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, UNICEF, the World Food \r\nProgramme, the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations, the United Nations Population \r\nFund and the World Health Organization, as well as the \r\ngrass-roots groups and non-governmental organizations \r\nworking on a day-to-day basis with our Government \r\nin combating poverty and the vulnerabilities of our \r\npopulation and advocating respect for human dignity.\r\nThe people of Guinea-Bissau look forward to the \r\nactive engagement of those bodies in assisting in the \r\nnew phase of our accelerated efforts to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Guinea-Bissau is \r\npoised to transform its territory into an area of peace, \r\nsecurity, and openness for all of those who, together \r\nwith our people, wish to build a more brotherly, secure, \r\nwelcoming and progress-oriented society with all \r\npeoples and cultures.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Domingos Simões Pereira, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joe Natuman, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Vanuatu\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Joe Natuman, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nVanuatu, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Joe Natuman, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Natuman (Vanuatu): Vanuatu is honoured to \r\njoin other speakers in congratulating Mr. Sam Kutesa \r\non assuming the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session. I believe that his able leadership \r\nwill successfully guide the session to its conclusion. \r\nLet me also extend my gratitude to his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador John Ashe, for his exemplary leadership \r\nand the important achievements during his tenure in \r\nthe past year.\r\nSince the last session of the General Assembly, \r\nmany major global events have taken place which, on \r\nthe one hand, have contributed to strengthening the \r\ninternational system and, on the other, have threatened \r\ninternational peace and security and directly derailed the \r\nprocess of development, resulting in the marginalization \r\nof the vulnerable populations of our societies. Given \r\npast efforts to address the global financial crisis, we \r\nhave witnessed some recovery of the global economy. \r\nThat is good news; but it is well known that the recovery \r\n12/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nis fragile and further international efforts are needed to \r\nensure that global growth prospects in the long run will \r\nremain solid and sustainable.\r\nWe are concerned about prolonged periods of \r\nconflict that have led to the displacement of the most \r\ndisadvantaged members of our societies, including \r\nwomen, children and the disabled. It bothers us to see \r\nthe increased radicalization of groups and individuals \r\nthat have been targeted to create terror and impose \r\nthreats against countries, Governments and citizens. \r\nThose are all problems that could be avoided, if all \r\ncountries adhered strictly to the peaceful principles of \r\ndialogue enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAs members of the international community, we have a \r\nmoral duty to ensure that the principles of dialogue and \r\nreasoning prevail in order to address conflict. I have \r\nno doubt that the multilateral system is best placed to \r\naddress the challenges.\r\nThe outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus that \r\nhas claimed over 2,000 lives in West Africa has \r\nalso concerned us greatly. In this regard, we highly \r\ncommend the efforts of the United Nations agencies, \r\nin particular the World Health Organization, and the \r\ninternational community in addressing the security \r\nrisks of the epidemic. Likewise, the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and his determination in addressing \r\nthe challenges are most commendable. I would like \r\nto reiterate my Government’s support for the ongoing \r\nefforts.\r\nConcerning the political developments in the Pacific \r\nregion, I wish to congratulate the people of the Republic \r\nof Fiji on successfully and peacefully electing a new \r\ndemocratic Government. My Government commends \r\nthe people of Fiji for their resilience and steadfastness, \r\nand I congratulate the newly elected Prime Minister on \r\nfulfilling his promise to the international community to \r\nsuccessfully lead his country to a democratic election.\r\nVanuatu, a small island developing State, has a \r\nsmall economy which is open and vulnerable to internal \r\nand external shocks. Those characteristics have \r\ndetermined and shaped our development outcomes. For \r\ndecades now, our economy has been growing and is now \r\ngenerating increasing per capita incomes. Vanuatu was \r\none of the countries that called on the United Nations to \r\nallow vulnerability to become one of the three criteria \r\nused in assessing or identifying graduation cases. \r\nVanuatu’s vulnerability was recognized as a result of \r\nthe revised criteria, and our country ceased to qualify \r\nfor graduation. It was not until the end of the twentieth \r\ncentury that Vanuatu’s eligibility for graduation from \r\nleast developed country (LDC) status was raised again, \r\nafter a decade of unquestionable economic progress in \r\nour island nation.\r\nAfter the Committee for Development Policy \r\nand the Economic and Social Council reviewed our \r\nprogress in 2012, the General Assembly, in December \r\n2013, decided that Vanuatu would graduate (see \r\nA/68/PV.59). At the same time, a grace period of four \r\nyears was granted to enable a smooth transition to \r\npost-LDC life. Vanuatu’s graduation from LDC status \r\nis now scheduled to take place in December 2017. \r\nMy Government accepts that as a positive signpost. \r\nHowever, the issue of vulnerability must be carefully \r\naddressed by the United Nations.\r\nWe are examining the LDC benefits we may \r\neventually lose, with a view to negotiating the \r\npossibility of retaining certain concessions we deem \r\nimportant — if not vital — in sustaining economic \r\ndevelopment. Our impression of the graduation process \r\nis that our attention is being drawn to the question of \r\nsmooth transition, while the real issue — the question \r\nof vulnerability, even during the post-graduation \r\nstage — is being circumvented. Our situation could best \r\nbe described using the analogy of an aircraft. Vanuatu is \r\nin the descent phase, but the focus should not be on the \r\nsmooth landing; rather, we must look to what happens \r\nafter the smooth landing, as that is the real issue. Our \r\nvulnerabilities as a small island developing State (SIDS) \r\nremain undiminished, with lasting disadvantages and \r\ngrowing challenges regardless of our graduation from \r\nLDC status.\r\nWhat is it, then, that the United Nations, which has \r\nbeen so generous in recognizing our vulnerabilities, \r\ncan now offer us, as a SIDS, in support of our efforts \r\nto build resilience and productive capacity, and in \r\nsupport of our climate adaptation expenditure? Surely \r\nSIDS dealing with such issues deserve as much special \r\nattention as do LDCs. Is it unreasonable to expect \r\nthat attention be translated into some form of special \r\ntreatment for SIDS? We appreciate the focus of the \r\nUnited Nations on the importance of a smooth transition \r\nfor graduating countries, but we also urge it not to be \r\ndistracted from the real question, which is the way we \r\nSIDS will be treated after graduation.\r\nLike other, similar economies, while Vanuatu has \r\nmade some headway towards meeting the Millennium \r\n14-55181 13/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), it is still finding it difficult \r\nto achieve all of the goals by 2015. The reasons for that \r\nare numerous, but one of the significant difficulties is \r\nour narrow revenue base, coupled with a geographically \r\ndispersed population scattered over our 83 islands, \r\nwhich makes it a challenge for the Government to deliver \r\nbasic services to all of its people. We are grateful that \r\nour development partners are always there to support \r\nus. Given the challenges that SIDS and LDCs face \r\nin financing development, I appeal to the developed \r\ncountries to honour their commitment to increasing \r\ntheir aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national product, as \r\nagreed on in the Monterrey Consensus.\r\nThe current problem of terrorism threatens the \r\nsecurity of States and the safety and well-being of \r\ninnocent and vulnerable women and children. The \r\nkidnapping of innocent people, including some of \r\nour peacekeepers, is a threat to international security \r\nand peace. As a participant in various United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions, I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to the United Nations and other countries for \r\ntheir assistance in negotiating the release of Fiji’s United \r\nNations peacekeepers. The cooperation in this respect \r\nof members of the international community is a positive \r\nsign for the concept of our collective responsibility for \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe salute the Secretary-General for his leadership \r\nas a vigorous campaigner for climate action and for \r\nconvening this year’s Climate Summit. Leaders made \r\nmany pledges and commitments during the Summit, \r\nand we look forward to seeing the rhetoric translated \r\ninto urgent action. My delegation calls on the United \r\nNations family to stand together to find ways to \r\naddress climate-change issues. We are staring at a \r\nclimate-change bubble, and the longer we delay action, \r\nthe costlier it will be for our future generations. We \r\nmust act now and fast to ensure that we steer clear of \r\nthe current dangerous carbon-pollution trajectory.\r\nThe theme for the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”, is \r\ntimely and relevant, particularly considering the ongoing \r\nefforts to arrive at a new post-2015 development agenda \r\nfor all countries. I commend the excellent progress that \r\nhas been made in this area, and I recognize that it is \r\nnot easy to negotiate such goals, with so many member \r\ncountries and the different groups they represent, all of \r\nwhich want their development agendas incorporated. I \r\nbelieve that our draft agenda does represent a consensus \r\non the part of every United Nations Member and that it \r\nis capable of bringing development to a new level in all \r\nof our countries.\r\nAs a Pacific small island developing State, we \r\nare dealing with numerous development challenges \r\nthat the United Nations system and the international \r\ncommunity should address. I reiterate that climate \r\nchange is a major global challenge for all of us. Some \r\nPacific States are facing an existential threat, and we \r\ncannot deal with the issue of sustainable development \r\nalone if climate-change challenges are not addressed \r\nseriously by the international community. To that end, \r\nit is vital that climate change remain one of the major \r\nelements on the agenda of sustainable development \r\ngoals (SDGs).\r\nWe note that this is a matter for considerable debate, \r\nowing to its cross-cutting nature. However, it is not a \r\nnew issue, for the climate-change agenda is prominently \r\nfeatured in “The future we want” outcome document \r\nof the 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 66/288, annex). Our current \r\nefforts to address climate change are consistent with \r\nthat, and it is another reason why our climate-change \r\ntargets should be more ambitious. We strongly urge \r\nthat the target of holding the increase in global average \r\ntemperature below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels be \r\nincluded in the SDGs.\r\nIn addition to climate change, our support for the \r\nSDGs extends but is not limited to the inclusion of \r\npeace and effective institutions; ocean management; \r\nhealth and education; energy security and gender \r\nequality. We also concur with the emphasis on the \r\nmeans of implementation in the report of the Open \r\nWorking Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (A/68/970) and urge the United \r\nNations and the developed countries to continue to \r\nsupport developing countries, especially the SIDS \r\nand LDCs, in the areas of sustainable development \r\nfinancing and improving institutional capacity in their \r\nefforts to promote development.\r\nCoincidentally, my country is at an important \r\nstage in its development planning process. Our current \r\ndevelopment planning framework will come to an \r\nend in the fourth quarter of 2015, and we are already \r\nconsulting for the post-2015 era. The agenda and issues \r\nbeing discussed in the global arena will be translated \r\ninto and merged with our development aspirations. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to call on our \r\n14/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\ndevelopment partners to support us by working in \r\nharmony and in a true spirit of partnership to help us to \r\nfulfil the dreams of our people, particularly our young \r\nand more vulnerable generation.\r\nMy Government acknowledges the synergy of the \r\nefforts being made by the United Nations and the British \r\nCommonwealth to uphold the international principles \r\nof peace and good governance, as well as in promoting \r\nstronger partnerships for inclusive development. I \r\nwould like to ask the United Nations to allow the views \r\nexpressed by the Commonwealth Heads of Government \r\non the post-development agenda to be seen as additional \r\ncontributions to that process.\r\nMy country has a history that evolved as the \r\nresult of a long political struggle to achieve political \r\nindependence, which finally came in 1980. But when \r\nmost of us were young, it was governed by Britain \r\nand France, and we were stateless in our own country, \r\nneither French nor British citizens. For more than seven \r\ndecades, we were exposed to foreign rule. We thus had \r\nto struggle to reconstruct our identity as a nation that \r\ncould govern itself rather than be subjected to foreign \r\nrule. In 1981, after independence was achieved in 1980, \r\nI finally arrived here at the United Nations with our late \r\nformer Prime Minister, Walter Lini. I clearly remember \r\nthat cold autumn morning, when a small group, along \r\nwith the United Nations protocol staff, gathered outside \r\nthe entrance of this magnificent building to raise our \r\nf lag for the first time at the United Nations. A new \r\nnation was born and was accepted by the United Nations \r\nfamily of nations.\r\nAs a freedom fighter and as the Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Vanuatu who took office less than six \r\nmonths ago, I proudly stand here today to thank the \r\nUnited Nations for the recognition and endorsement of \r\nour membership. But more importantly, here on this \r\nrostrum I want to underscore the unfinished business \r\nof the United Nations with regard to bringing closure \r\nto its work on decolonization. Part of my country’s \r\nsovereign territory is still being disputed by one of our \r\nformer colonial Powers, which is also our dear friend \r\nand development partner.\r\nI am delighted that the United Nations once again, \r\nthrough the work of the former United Nations Special \r\nRapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, \r\nMr. James Anaya, brought the matter to the twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. \r\nMy country is delighted that in 2012 France responded \r\nto that action and expressed its openness to dialogue. \r\nWe believe such openness is a necessary element for \r\nprogress so that our indigenous peoples will be able to \r\nresume their rights to fully exercise their cultural and \r\nspiritual obligations on the two islands of Umaenupne/\r\nMatthew and Leka/Hunter, and to revive the traditional \r\nroutes of our ancestors in Tafea province.\r\nMy country’s political struggles have led to a strong \r\nposition on decolonization. We share the dreams of \r\nthose who are still longing for freedom so that they can \r\nachieve self-government and independence. As we near \r\nthe midpoint of the United Nations Third International \r\nDecade for the Eradication of Colonialism, I want to \r\necho those voices, from within our region and beyond, \r\nwho should one day be able to stand on this podium as \r\nfree and democratic nations.\r\nMy country acknowledges the message of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, reminding the \r\n2014 Pacific regional seminar of the United Nations \r\nDecolonization Committee held in May this year \r\nthat “good intentions will have to be translated into \r\ncredible action to make the Third International Decade \r\na success”. In that connection, my country supports \r\nthe conclusions and recommendations contained in the \r\nreport of the United Nations visiting mission to New \r\nCaledonia this year (A/AC.109/2014/20/Rev.1) and calls \r\non the United Nations and the international community \r\nto pursue their efforts to provide support to the people of \r\nNew Caledonia and the Government of France in their \r\nendeavour to implement a successful decolonization \r\nprocess under the Nouméa Accord.\r\nAt the nineteenth Melanesian Spearhead Group \r\nLeaders Summit in June 2013 in New Caledonia, the \r\nGroup’s leaders renewed their commitment through \r\na declaration to support the Front de libération \r\nnationale kanak socialiste (FLNKS) in their pursuit \r\nfor full emancipation under the Nouméa Accord, \r\nthrough the provision of technical assistance and \r\ntraining programmes for the Kanak peoples to assist \r\nthem in their struggle to fully exercise their right to \r\nself-determination and independence. While the New \r\nCaledonian people look forward to a political transition, \r\nI call upon the United Nations, through its regional \r\nagencies, to provide assistance to New Caledonia, in \r\nparticular the FLNKS and the Kanak people, in specific \r\nareas of training to enable them to fully participate in \r\nthe implementation of the Nouméa Accord. I appreciate \r\nthe cooperative efforts of the Government of France for \r\nfacilitating the implementation of the Nouméa Accord \r\n14-55181 15/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nin a very mature and responsible manner. Those efforts \r\nmust not be derailed.\r\nI cannot close this section of my speech without \r\npaying tribute to the late Mr. John Ondawame, a \r\nfreedom fighter from West Papua, who passed away \r\nlast month while in exile in my country. He was laid \r\nto rest in my country as a hero who had fought for \r\nthe rights to self-determination for the people of West \r\nPapua. He and other martyrs had a dream that one \r\nday the United Nations and all nations advocating and \r\npromoting democratic principles would hear their cries \r\nand deliver on the promise of a self-determined future. \r\nAt his funeral service, I stated that his struggle for \r\nfreedom and justice would continue to be our struggle \r\nuntil colonialism is eradicated.\r\nThere are many other heroes in many countries \r\nthat are still voiceless and are suffering in silence, \r\neither owing to unilateral policy choices, or because \r\nof ignorance on the part of the multilateral system. \r\nMy country is encouraged by the onset of f lexibility \r\nexercised by the United States of America towards the \r\nCuban people. I believe that the willingness for dialogue \r\nand consideration is a responsible gesture that will \r\nslowly open the door for a better future for all Cubans. \r\nWe must, as individual countries, be ready to be a voice \r\nfor the voiceless. Bigger and richer countries must be \r\nthe burden-bearers for smaller nations. In doing so, we \r\ndemonstrate our willingness to live as a village, a world \r\ncommunity of friends and not aggressors. I want to \r\nstress that the only way to address that issue is through \r\ndialogue and unity. It is our moral responsibility not to \r\nfail those who have been victims of past ignorance.\r\nMy country and many others have repeatedly raised \r\nthese concerns on this same podium for many years, \r\nbecause we subscribe to them as inalienable human \r\nrights. The concerns of vulnerability, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, fisheries, job creation, human rights \r\nand many others are reflected in the Small Island \r\nDeveloping States Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(Samoa Pathway) outcome document (A/CONF.223/3, \r\nannex). My country fully endorses the Samoa Pathway \r\ndocument as a guide that is to be used to navigate \r\nthrough our development challenges.\r\nThe Samoa Pathway, built on the Barbados \r\nProgramme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy \r\nfor Implementation, has charted a decisive course \r\ngoing forward. The United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community are urged to ensure that it is \r\nintegrated into a transformative post-2015 development \r\nframework and that we close the implementation gaps \r\nof the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to thank the \r\nGovernment and the people of Samoa for ably hosting \r\nthe third International Conference on Small Island \r\nDeveloping States held in Apia.\r\nI deeply appreciate the opportunity to present my \r\nviews to this important forum. I hope that the statements \r\nand the deliberations that we make today will translate \r\ninto concrete actions leading to a better future for all \r\nour peoples. Long live our aspirations to create lasting \r\npeace and a better world for our people! May God bless \r\nthe United Nations!\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joe Natuman, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Vanuatu, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nCardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of the Holy \r\nSee.\r\nCardinal Parolin (Holy See): In extending the \r\nHoly See’s congratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session, I wish to convey the cordial \r\ngreetings of His Holiness Pope Francis to him and to all \r\nparticipating delegations. He assures the President of his \r\ncloseness and prayers for the Assembly’s work during \r\nthis session with the hope that it will be carried out in \r\nan atmosphere of productive collaboration, working for \r\na more fraternal and united world by identifying ways \r\nto resolve the serious problems that beset the whole \r\nhuman family today.\r\nIn continuity with his predecessors, Pope Francis \r\nrecently reiterated the Holy See’s esteem and \r\nappreciation for the United Nations as an indispensable \r\nmeans of building an authentic family of peoples. The \r\nHoly See values the efforts of this institution to ensure \r\nworld peace, respect for human dignity, the protection \r\nof persons, especially the poorest and most vulnerable, \r\nand harmonious economic and social development.\r\nAlthough mindful of the human person’s gifts and \r\nabilities, Pope Francis observes that today there is the \r\ndanger of widespread indifference. To the extent that \r\n16/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nindifference concerns the field of politics, it also affects \r\neconomic and social sectors, since an important part \r\nof humanity does not share in the benefits of progress \r\nand is in fact relegated to the status of second-class \r\ncitizens. At times, such apathy is synonymous with \r\nirresponsibility.\r\nI also recall the words of His Holiness to the \r\nSecretary-General at the beginning of August: “It is with \r\na heavy and anguished heart that I have been following \r\nthe dramatic events in northern Iraq”. He was thinking \r\nof the tears, the suffering and the heartfelt cries of \r\ndespair of Christians and other religious minorities of \r\nthat beloved land. In that same letter the Pope renewed \r\nhis urgent appeal to the international community to \r\ntake action to end the humanitarian tragedy now under \r\nway. He further encouraged all the competent organs \r\nof the United Nations, in particular those responsible \r\nfor security, peace, humanitarian law and assistance to \r\nrefugees, to continue their efforts in accordance with \r\nthe Preamble and relevant Articles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nToday, I am compelled to repeat the heartfelt appeal \r\nof His Holiness and to propose to the General Assembly \r\nand to the other competent organs of the United Nations \r\nthat they deepen their understanding of the difficult \r\nand complex time in which we are now living.\r\nWith the dramatic situation in northern Iraq \r\nand some parts of Syria, we are seeing a totally new \r\nphenomenon — the existence of a terrorist organization \r\nthat threatens all States, vowing to dissolve them \r\nand to replace them with a pseudo-religious world \r\ngovernment. Unfortunately, as the Holy Father recently \r\nsaid, even today there are those who would presume to \r\nwield power by coercing consciences and taking lives, \r\npersecuting and murdering in the name of God. Those \r\nactions bring injury to entire ethnic groups, populations \r\nand ancient cultures. It must be remembered that \r\nsuch violence is borne out of a disregard for God and \r\nfalsifies religion itself, since religion aims instead at \r\nreconciling men and women with God, at illuminating \r\nand purifying consciences and at making it clear that \r\neach human being is the image of the Creator.\r\nIn a world of global communications, that new \r\nphenomenon has found followers in numerous places \r\nand has succeeded in attracting from around the \r\nworld young people who are often disillusioned by \r\nwidespread indifference and a dearth of values in \r\nwealthier societies. That challenge, in all its tragic \r\naspects, should compel the international community \r\nto promote a unified response, based on solid juridical \r\ncriteria and a collective willingness to cooperate for the \r\ncommon good.\r\nTo that end, the Holy See considers it useful to focus \r\nattention on two major areas. The first is to address \r\nthe cultural and political origins of contemporary \r\nchallenges, acknowledging the need for innovative \r\nstrategies to confront those international problems in \r\nwhich cultural factors play a fundamental role. The \r\nsecond area for consideration is further study of the \r\neffectiveness of international law today, namely, its \r\nsuccessful implementation by those mechanisms used \r\nby the United Nations to prevent war, stop aggressors, \r\nprotect populations and help victims.\r\nFollowing the attacks of 9/11, when the world woke \r\nup to the reality of a new form of terrorism, some media \r\nand think tanks oversimplified the tragic moment by \r\ninterpreting all subsequent and problematic situations \r\nin terms of a clash of civilizations. That view ignored \r\nlong-standing and profound experiences of good \r\nrelations between cultures, ethnic groups and religions \r\nand interpreted other complex situations through that \r\nlens, situations such as the Middle East question and \r\ncivil conflicts occurring elsewhere.\r\nWhat, then, are the paths open to us?\r\nFirst and foremost, there is the path of promoting \r\ndialogue and understanding among cultures, which is \r\nimplicit in the Preamble and Article 1 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. That path must become an ever more \r\nexplicit objective of the international community and of \r\nGovernments if we are truly committed to peace in the \r\nworld. The natural growth and enrichment of culture \r\nis the fruit of all components of civil society working \r\ntogether. International organizations and States have \r\nthe task of promoting and supporting, in a decisive \r\nway and with the necessary financial means, those \r\ninitiatives and movements that promote dialogue and \r\nunderstanding among cultures, religions and peoples. \r\nPeace, after all, is not the fruit of a balance of powers, \r\nbut rather the result of justice at every level and, most \r\nimportantly, is the shared responsibility of individuals, \r\ncivil institutions and Governments.\r\nAnd yet, we do not face the challenges of terrorism \r\nand violence with cultural openness alone. The \r\nimportant path of international law is also available \r\nto us. The situation today requires a more incisive \r\nunderstanding of international law, with particular \r\n14-55181 17/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nattention to the responsibility to protect. One of the \r\ncharacteristics of the recent terrorist phenomenon is \r\nthat it disregards the existence of the State and, in fact, \r\nthe entire international order. Terrorism aims not only \r\nto bring change to Governments, to damage economic \r\nstructures or simply to commit common crimes, it \r\nseeks also to directly control areas within one or more \r\nStates and to impose its own laws, which are distinct \r\nand opposed to those of the sovereign State. It also \r\nundermines and rejects all existing juridical systems, \r\nin an attempt to impose dominion over consciences and \r\ncomplete control over persons.\r\nThe global nature of this phenomenon, which \r\nknows no borders, is precisely why the framework of \r\ninternational law offers the only viable way of dealing \r\nwith this urgent challenge. This reality requires a \r\nrenewed United Nations that undertakes to foster and \r\npreserve peace.\r\nGiven that the new forms of terrorism are \r\ntransnational, they no longer fall under the competence \r\nof the security forces of any one State. The territories \r\nof several States are involved. Therefore, the combined \r\nforces of a number of nations will be required to \r\nguarantee the defence of unarmed citizens. Since \r\nthere is no juridical norm justifying unilateral policing \r\nactions beyond one’s own borders, there is no doubt that \r\nthat area of competence lies with the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation wishes to recall that it is both licit and \r\nurgent to stop aggression through multilateral action \r\nand a proportionate use of force. As the representative \r\nbody of a worldwide religious community that embraces \r\ndifferent nations, cultures and ethnicities, the Holy See \r\nearnestly hopes that the international community will \r\nassume responsibility in considering the best means to \r\nstop all aggression and prevent the perpetration of new \r\nand even graver injustices.\r\nIt is paramount that there be a unity of action for \r\nthe common good, while avoiding the crossfire of \r\nvetoes. As His Holiness wrote to the Secretary-General \r\non 9 August,\r\n“the most basic understanding of human dignity \r\ncompels the international community, particularly \r\nthrough the norms and mechanisms of international \r\nlaw, to do all that it can to stop and to prevent \r\nfurther systematic violence against ethnic and \r\nreligious minorities”.\r\nWhile the concept of the responsibility to protect is \r\nimplicit in the constitutional principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and of humanitarian law, it does not \r\nspecifically favour a recourse to arms; it asserts, rather, \r\nthe responsibility of the entire international community, \r\nin a spirit of solidarity, to confront heinous crimes such \r\nas genocide, ethnic cleansing and religiously motivated \r\npersecution. Today, I cannot fail to mention the many \r\nChristians and ethnic minorities who in recent months \r\nhave endured atrocious persecution and suffering in \r\nIraq and Syria.\r\nIn its resolution 68/6, the General Assembly \r\ndecided that it would at the present session discuss the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, which would then be \r\nformally adopted at its seventieth session, in September \r\n2015. The President aptly chose the main theme of the \r\npresent session to be “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”. In \r\na communication to the recent meeting of the Chief \r\nExecutives of the agencies, funds and programmes of \r\nthe United Nations, His Holiness requested that future \r\nobjectives for sustainable development be formulated\r\n“with generosity and courage, so that they can have \r\na real impact on the structural causes of poverty and \r\nhunger, attain more substantial results in protecting \r\nthe environment, ensure dignified and productive \r\nlabour for all and provide appropriate protection \r\nfor the family, which is an essential element \r\nin sustainable human and social development. \r\nSpecifically, this involves challenging all forms of \r\ninjustice and resisting the economy of exclusion, \r\nthe throwaway culture and the culture of death”.\r\nIn that regard, the Holy See welcomes the \r\n17 sustainable development goals proposed by the \r\nOpen Working Group of the General Assembly on \r\nSustainable Development Goals, which seek to address \r\nthe structural causes of poverty by promoting dignified \r\nlabour for everyone. Equally, the Holy See appreciates \r\nthat the goals and targets do not, for the most part, \r\necho wealthy populations’ fears regarding population \r\ngrowth in poorer countries. It also welcomes the fact \r\nthat the goals and targets do not impose on poorer States \r\nlifestyles that are typically associated with advanced \r\neconomies and which tend to show a disregard for \r\nhuman dignity.\r\nAs stated earlier, the responsibility to protect is \r\nrelevant to cases of extreme aggressions against human \r\nrights and cases of serious contempt of humanitarian \r\n18/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nlaw or grave natural catastrophes. In a similar way, \r\nthere is a need to make legal provision for protecting \r\npeople against other forms of aggression that are less \r\nevident but just as serious and real. For example, a \r\nfinancial system governed only by speculation and the \r\nmaximization of profits, or one in which individual \r\npersons are regarded as disposable items in a culture of \r\nwaste, could be tantamount, in certain circumstances, to \r\nan offence against human dignity. It follows, therefore, \r\nthat the United Nations and its Member States have an \r\nurgent and grave responsibility for the poor and the \r\nexcluded, mindful always that social and economic \r\njustice is an essential condition for peace.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nEach day of the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly, and indeed of its next four sessions, until \r\nNovember 2018, will bear the sad and painful memory \r\nof the futile and inhumane tragedy of the First World \r\nWar — a senseless slaughter, as Pope Benedict XV \r\nreferred to it, with its millions of victims and untold \r\ndestruction. Marking the centenary of the start of the \r\nconflict, His Holiness Pope Francis expressed his \r\ndesire that\r\n“the mistakes of the past are not repeated, that the \r\nlessons of history are acknowledged, and that the \r\ncause of peace may always prevail through patient \r\nand courageous dialogue”.\r\nIn making my own the sentiments of the Holy \r\nFather, I fervently hope that they may be shared by all \r\npresent here. I offer to all members of the Assembly my \r\nbest wishes in their work. I trust that this session will \r\nspare no effort to put to an end the clamour of weapons \r\nthat marks existing conflicts and that it will continue \r\nto foster the development of the entire human race, in \r\nparticular the poorest among us.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Secretary of State of the Holy See \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nArchbishop Pietro Parolin, Secretary of State of \r\nthe Holy See, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Walid Al-Moualem, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like to congratulate you, Sir, and your \r\nfriendly country, Uganda, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its current session and to \r\nwish you success in leading the work of the session, \r\nbearing in mind the important and neutral role of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I would also like to \r\nthank your predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, for his efforts.\r\nMany events and significant changes have taken \r\nplace since I stood here last year (see A/68/PV.21). Those \r\nevents have surprised many of the countries represented \r\nhere today, but they did not surprise us, since we have \r\nbeen warning the international community about \r\ntrends leading towards the current situation for the past \r\nthree and a half years. Speeches from this rostrum have \r\nfocused on the economic and political crises that we \r\nhave been waiting for the international community to \r\nresolve. However, talking about such issues is no longer \r\na priority.\r\nWhat we have been witnessing for a few months is \r\nmuch more dangerous than all the political and economic \r\ncrises that have been happening in the world. More than \r\nonce and from more than one international platform, we \r\nhave talked about the grave threat of terrorism that is \r\nstriking Syria. We said that such terrorism would not be \r\nlimited to the territory of my country, since terrorism \r\nhas no boundaries. Extremist ideologies acknowledge \r\nonly themselves and do not recognize anything but \r\nslaughter, murder and torture. Today we are witnessing \r\nwhat the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the \r\nmost dangerous terrorist organization in the entire world \r\nin terms of its unprecedented funding and brutality, is \r\ndoing to Syrians and Iraqis of all stripes and religions. \r\nThat terrorist organization is enslaving women, raping \r\nthem and selling them in slave markets. It decapitates \r\nand cuts off limbs, teaches children to slaughter and \r\nmurder and destroys historical and cultural monuments, \r\nas well as Islamic and Christian symbols.\r\nAll that is happening before the eyes of the entire \r\nworld and countries that have vowed always to fight \r\nterrorism, even though they themselves have not \r\nexperienced the scourge of terror. Today I stand here \r\nto ask the following. Is it not time for all of us to stand \r\nunited in the face of the serious threat of terrorist takfiri \r\nideology worldwide? Has the time not come for all of us \r\nto admit that ISIL, the Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida \r\naffiliates will not remain within the borders of Syria and \r\nIraq but will spread to every place that they can reach, \r\nstarting with Europe and America? Should we not learn \r\nthe lesson of what happened in previous years and unite \r\nall international efforts so as to deal with those groups? \r\nThose organizations have rallied extremists from all \r\n14-55181 19/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\ncorners of the Earth and brought them to one place to \r\ntrain and arm them. They then spread their ideology \r\nand terrorism through those extremists back to where \r\nthey came from.\r\nSome people may say that a resolution was recently \r\nadopted unanimously under Chapter VII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations in order to prevent the expansion \r\nof that organization and other terrorist groups and to \r\neradicate them. It is true that it is better to arrive late \r\nthan never. The resolution, adopted on 15 August, in \r\nfact came too late. However, the issue here is whether \r\neveryone is serious about its implementation, as we \r\nhave not yet seen any serious steps to implement it. \r\nFurthermore, we have not seen any real sense of fear \r\namong the regional States that continue to provide all \r\nkinds of support to those terrorist groups, not enough \r\nfear to cause them to work for the implementation of \r\nthe resolution. On the contrary, what we see on the \r\npart of the United States Administration is a policy of \r\ndouble standards and alliances in order to carry out \r\ncertain political agendas, in particular by supporting \r\nwith money, weapons and training groups that they call \r\nmoderate.\r\nThat will lead only to more violence and terrorism, \r\nthe shedding of more Syrian blood, a protracted Syrian \r\ncrisis and the prevention of any political solution. \r\nSuch behaviour creates fertile ground for the growth \r\nof terrorist groups that are committing the most \r\nheinous crimes on Syrian territory. That requires all \r\nof us to seriously and effectively address and eradicate \r\nterrorism in order to restore security and stability in \r\nSyria and the region. Today, enslaved women look to \r\nus to see what we will do for them, their sisters and \r\ntheir children. The sons and daughters of the victims \r\nbeheaded by ISIL await our action and our response in \r\nthe face of the atrocities that are being committed daily \r\nby that terrorist organization, the Nusra Front and other \r\ngroups.\r\nCombating terrorism cannot be achieved through \r\nunimplemented United Nations resolutions. Intentions \r\nare meaningless. We can fight terrorism through \r\nthe real implementation of resolutions or, clearly, by \r\nmeans of military strikes. But, most importantly, it \r\ncan be achieved by preventing States from arming, \r\nsupporting, training, funding and smuggling those \r\nterrorist groups. We must also deprive terrorism of its \r\nresources. Striking terrorism militarily while some \r\nStates continue to support terrorist groups will create a \r\nvicious cycle from which the international community \r\nwill not escape for decades.\r\nMilitary strikes should take place at the same time as \r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution 2178 \r\n(2014), adopted on 24 September under Chapter VII. \r\nWe must also put pressure on countries that provide \r\nmultifaceted support to such terrorist groups. Those \r\ncountries are well known to us all. The most important \r\nissue is to put pressure on those countries that have \r\nexported and continue to export extremist Takfiri \r\nideology, thereby seriously jeopardizing international \r\npeace and security. ISIL is an ideology transformed into \r\nan organization that is supported, armed and trained \r\nto be unleashed against Syria, Iraq and Lebanon like a \r\nmonster.\r\nLet us together put an end to that ideology and \r\nits exporters. Let us simultaneously put pressure on \r\nthe countries that have joined the coalition led by the \r\nUnited States so as to put an end to their support of \r\narmed terrorist groups. Only then does combating \r\nterrorism militarily become viable. Otherwise, our \r\npresence there will not measure up to the tears of the \r\ncaptives, enslaved women and children who have fallen \r\nvictim to Daesh, the Nusrah Front and other groups.\r\nOnce again, the Syrian Arab Republic reiterates \r\nthat it stands with any international effort to combat \r\nterrorism. We stress that that must be done with full \r\nrespect for the lives of innocent civilians and for \r\nnational sovereignty, in conformity with international \r\nagreements. At the same time, the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic would like to thank all countries that have \r\nstood firm and rejected any prejudice to the sovereignty \r\nof other States, underscoring respect for international \r\nresolutions.\r\nIt is high time to unite all our efforts against \r\nsuch terrorism, since everyone is surrounded by the \r\nimminent threat and no country is immune to it. My \r\ncountry maintains its declared position of the 1980s \r\nwith regard to fighting terrorism before it becomes \r\nrampant, as is currently happening.\r\nIn Syria we respect our commitments and honour \r\nour promises and pledges. We have confirmed that \r\nposition on more than one occasion, particularly since \r\nthe beginning of the Syrian crisis.\r\nSyria agreed unconditionally to attend the Geneva II \r\nConference on Syria and participated in its deliberations \r\nwith an open mind, although we were convinced that \r\n20/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nthe solution to the crisis should be Syrian-owned and \r\ntake place on Syrian territory. However, as a goodwill \r\ngesture, in order to put an end to the shedding of Syrian \r\nblood, we went to Geneva, only to find a delegation that \r\nwas not negotiating on behalf of Syrians.\r\nFirst, that delegation has no influence whatsoever \r\non the ground in Syria and has neither popularity nor \r\nlegitimacy among the Syrian people. The delegation \r\nwas negotiating with the Syrian Government while \r\nfollowing the orders of its Western masters. It does \r\nnot believe in combating or contronting terrorism. \r\nFurthermore, that delegation does not respect Syria’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. and it verbally \r\nrefuses to ask terrorist groups to stop their terrorist acts. \r\nWe know that that opposition and delegation would not \r\nbe able to pressure anyone, either armed groups or any \r\nSyrian faction on the ground.\r\nWe went to Geneva with the priority of combating \r\nterrorism, since we believed, and continue to believe, \r\nthat we cannot embark on any political solution while \r\nterrorism is still rampant in Syria. Some in Geneva \r\nopposed our acknowledging the fight against terrorism \r\nas a priority, although it is a paramount part of the \r\nprovisions of the Geneva declaration. However, the \r\ndelegation of the so-called coalition continued to reject \r\nany proposal to tackle or to condemn terrorism.\r\nNow we see the entire international community \r\nadopting our view that fighting terrorism is the top \r\npriority and that nothing whatsoever can be done as \r\nlong as terrorism brutally strikes everything in its way \r\nand terrorists return to countries from which they came. \r\nOnce again, we emphasize that we are ready for, and \r\neven actively seek, a political solution in Syria and talks \r\nwith all honourable opposition members who oppose \r\nterrorism in Syria and among Syrians themselves on \r\nSyrian territory.\r\nEveryone assumed their responsibility in the \r\npresidential elections, which took place before the eyes \r\nof the world. The will of the Syrian people is greater \r\nthan that of all those who have tried to suppress it for \r\nmore than three years now. That was demonstrated \r\nwhen the entire world heard the voice of the Syrian \r\npeople both inside Syria and beyond.\r\nNow, after the presidential elections, we would \r\nlike to tell all those who desire and look forward \r\nto a political solution in Syria that they must first \r\nrespect the Syrian people’s will, which was expressed \r\nexplicitly, clearly, firmly and loudly. For the first time \r\nin Syria’s modern history, they chose their President \r\nin multiparty elections, with international monitors \r\nfrom several countries who witnessed the integrity and \r\ntransparency of the elections, as well as the enthusiasm \r\nof the people to participate in them.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the Syrian people \r\nhave made their choice. Those who want to speak on \r\nbehalf of the people must first be representatives of the \r\npeople and, secondly, must respect the people’s will \r\nand their decisions. Any dialogue must therefore be \r\nbased on respect for the will of the Syrian people and \r\ntheir decisions. Accordingly, we are open to a political \r\nsolution in Syria with a genuine opposition that seeks \r\nthe prosperity, stability and security of Syria — an \r\nopposition that does not depend on external elements \r\nand speak on their behalf, an opposition that has an \r\nimpact in Syrian territory and has deep roots inside \r\nSyria, not in hotels and Western capitals. It must be \r\na national opposition that upholds fighting terrorism \r\nas its priority and encourages the ongoing national \r\nreconciliation efforts, paving the way for a successful \r\npolitical solution.\r\nHumanitarian needs in many basic areas have \r\nincreased because of the continuing terrorist attacks in \r\nSyria. The inhumane sanctions imposed by the European \r\nUnion and the United States have exacerbated the poor \r\nliving conditions of Syrian civilians. At the same time, \r\nmy Government is striving to meet the basic needs of \r\nour citizens, in particular those forced by terrorist acts \r\nto f lee their homes. We are doing that in cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations and its humanitarian agencies, \r\nin the context of the humanitarian response plans \r\nagreed by those bodies with the Syrian Government.\r\nWe should note that a great number of our people \r\nhave been forced to seek refuge in neighbouring \r\ncountries. Regrettably, some of those countries put \r\ndisplaced Syrians in military training camps resembling \r\nplaces of detention in order to train them to take up \r\narms. From this rostrum, I underscore the fact that the \r\nSyrian State guarantees for those citizens who wish it \r\na safe return and a decent life, free from the inhumane \r\nconditions that they suffer in those camps. I affirm \r\nSyria’s readiness to make every effort to deliver aid \r\nfrom international organizations to all Syrian citizens, \r\nwithout any discrimination whatsoever and wherever \r\nthey are, in the context of respect for our national \r\nsovereignty.\r\n14-55181 21/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic confirms its resolve with \r\nregard to the full restoration of the occupied Syrian \r\nGolan up to the line of 4 June 1967. It also emphasizes \r\nits rejection of all actions taken by Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, to change the natural, geographical and \r\ndemographic characteristics of the Golan, in clear \r\nviolation of the relevant Security Council resolutions, \r\nin particular resolutions 497 (1981) and 465 (1980).\r\nSyria also affirms that the Palestinian question is \r\nthe central issue for the Syrian people, who support \r\nthe inalienable and legitimate rights of the brotherly \r\nPalestinian people, particularly their right to return, \r\nto self-determination and to establish an independent \r\nState on their land, with Jerusalem as the capital.\r\nLast September, Syria accepted the initiative of the \r\nPresident of the Russian Federation, His Excellency \r\nMr. Vladimir Putin, and acceded to the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention on the basis of the need to render \r\nthe Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nall weapons of mass destruction. We also wanted to \r\nprove to the whole world our commitment to stand firm \r\nagainst any use of chemical weapons. Syria has met its \r\nobligations pursuant to its accession to the Convention \r\nand has fulfilled its commitments despite the current \r\ndifficult situation.\r\nWere it not for Syria’s cooperation with the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \r\n(OPCW)-United Nations Joint Mission, the Mission \r\ncould not have completed that task. The Special \r\nCoordinator of the Joint Mission, Ms. Sigrid Kaag, \r\nexpressed her happiness at and gratitude for the Syrian \r\nGovernment’s fruitful and constructive cooperation, \r\nwhich led to the completion of that unprecedented work.\r\nAs a State party, Syria is committed to the full \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the Chemical \r\nWeapons Convention within the framework of the \r\nOPCW. However, the big question remaining is whether \r\nthose who are supplying terrorists with chemical and \r\nother types of weapons will stop doing so and abide \r\nby international law, especially the Chemical Weapons \r\nConvention and the Security Council resolutions related \r\nto terrorism.\r\nSyria stresses that a Middle East zone free of all \r\nweapons of mass destruction cannot be established \r\nunless Israel, the only nuclear Power in the region, \r\naccedes to all treaties banning the proliferation of \r\nsuch weapons and puts its nuclear facilities under \r\nthe supervision of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency. At the same time, we emphasize the right of \r\nall countries to acquire and develop nuclear technology \r\nfor peaceful uses.\r\nThe imposition of unethical, unilateral coercive \r\neconomic measures by the United States and the \r\nEuropean Union contravenes international law and the \r\nprinciples of free trade. Therefore, we call for lifting \r\nthe blockade that the United States has imposed on \r\nCuba for decades, and we renew our call to lift and \r\nstop all the unilateral coercive measures imposed on \r\nSyria and the peoples of other countries, such as Iran, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Venezuela \r\nand Belarus.\r\nWe look forward to the United Nations being \r\nable to realize the aspirations of our peoples to live \r\nin dignity and to achieve development and food self-\r\nsufficiency, free from all forms of terrorism, tension \r\nand confrontation, in implementation of the principles \r\nand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations, in \r\nparticular safeguarding the States’ sovereignty and \r\nequality in rights and obligations. We also believe that \r\npriority should be given to concerted efforts by the \r\ninternational community to combat the terrorism of \r\nDaesh, Nusra Front and other Al-Qaida affiliates and \r\nto drain their resources so that security and stability \r\nwill prevail in our region and the entire world.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) \r\n(spoke in Lao; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nOn behalf of the Government of the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, I would like to extend my \r\nsincere congratulations to you, Sir, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. I assure you of our full support and cooperation \r\nin the discharge of your duties. I would also like to \r\nsincerely commend His Excellency Mr. John Ashe for \r\nthe successful completion of his work as President of \r\nthe Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.\r\nWe have just over 450 days remaining for the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). While many countries have made considerable \r\nachievements and will achieve the MDGs, others, like \r\nthe least developed countries, have seen slow progress \r\nand face various challenges in achieving all Goals \r\nwithin the time frame. Moreover, complex regional \r\n22/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nand international situations, such as armed conflicts, \r\npolitical unrest, pandemics and environmental \r\ndegradation, among others, have inevitably brought \r\nabout more obstacles to those countries’ efforts to \r\nrealize the MDGs.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, based on past experience, \r\nit is evident that socioeconomic development in any \r\ncountry can succeed only in an enabling, lasting and \r\nsecure environment. Only under such conditions could \r\nwe employ all efforts and draw on all potential and \r\nresources available in the country for development in \r\nthe most effective and sustainable manner.\r\nOver the 39 years of its existence, since the war \r\nended, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has \r\ndeployed all its efforts in national development, \r\nstarting from the period of healing the wounds of war \r\nto the era of formulating and implementing the seventh \r\nfive-year national socioeconomic development plan, \r\nbased on the renovation policy set by the Lao People’s \r\nRevolutionary Party. The achievements made in each \r\nperiod are the results of lessons learned through actual \r\ndevelopment activities carried out and from adapting \r\nto specific conditions within the country and to the \r\nexternal environment.\r\nLessons learned from friendly countries, both \r\nnear and far, are valuable assets. We therefore would \r\nlike to express our sincere appreciation to all friendly \r\ncountries for sharing their knowledge and experience, \r\nincluding both successes and failures, with the small \r\nand young Lao People’s Democratic Republic in each \r\nperiod.\r\nThe mid-term review of the implementation of the \r\nseventh five-year national socioeconomic development \r\nplan has shown that the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic has made remarkable achievements in many \r\nareas, especially in maintaining a steady pace of \r\neconomic growth, political stability and social order, \r\nthus ensuring that the Lao people of all ethnic groups \r\ncan enjoy their legitimate rights and freedom and can \r\nactively participate in national development. That has \r\nlaid a solid foundation for the country to move towards \r\nrealizing its ultimate goal of graduating from the least \r\ndeveloped country status by 2020. The achievements so \r\nfar were made possible not only due to national efforts, \r\nbut also through the support and cooperation extended \r\nby friendly countries and development partners, \r\nincluding international organizations, especially the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nNevertheless, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic has also been affected by the global financial \r\nand economic crisis in recent years. That has given rise \r\nto major obstacles to national economic development as \r\nwell as to the implementation of various development \r\ngoals. In that regard, the Lao Government has taken \r\ntimely measures to stabilize its macroeconomy, aimed \r\nat promoting sustained growth in the coming years.\r\nIn addition, as a landlocked and least developed \r\ncountry, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nremains vulnerable. It still faces numerous challenges, \r\nespecially in achieving some of the MDG targets, \r\nincluding reducing child malnutrition, ensuring gender \r\nequality in education and reducing child and maternal \r\nmortality.\r\nMinimizing the impact of unexploded ordnance \r\n(UXO) dropped during the war also remains a challenge. \r\nTaking into account the importance of dealing with \r\nthat matter, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic has \r\nadopted a localized millennium development goal on \r\naddressing the impact of UXO, as its national MDG 9.\r\nReducing the impact of UXO remains a huge \r\nburden and task for the country, as it hampers national \r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty. In that \r\nconnection, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nis one of the countries that initiated the process to \r\nformulate the Oslo Convention on Cluster Munitions. \r\nThe full and effective implementation of the Oslo \r\nConvention is of great importance, because it will lead \r\nto a total prohibition of the use, production or transfer \r\nof cluster munitions.\r\nIn that connection, I take this opportunity to convey \r\nour congratulations to Saint Kitts and Nevis, Belize \r\nand the Republic of the Congo on their ratification of \r\nthe Oslo Convention, which increased the total number \r\nof States having done so to 86. We hope that other \r\ncountries will also consider becoming parties to the \r\nConvention.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic shares \r\nthe common concern over the escalating armed \r\nconflicts in different parts of the world, which are \r\nposing increasingly major threats to the international \r\ncommunity. We urge all parties concerned to exercise \r\nthe utmost restraint and refrain from taking any action \r\nthat could cause loss of people’s lives or property. Only \r\nthrough addressing those conflicts by peaceful means \r\ncan we ensure mutual trust. Resentment and hostility \r\nagainst one another lead to escalating violence and use \r\n14-55181 23/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nof force, resulting in loss of life and property and pain \r\nand suffering for innocent people.\r\nIn addition, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nshares the strong concern about the escalating conflict \r\nin Palestine, which has led to loss of Palestinian lives. \r\nWe therefore urge a peaceful resolution of the issue of \r\nPalestine.\r\nIn this era of interdependence, cooperation and \r\nengagement are key factors for peaceful and mutually \r\nbeneficial coexistence. The enforcement of isolation and \r\nof sanction measures imposed on any country may not \r\nbenefit the international community. On the contrary, it \r\nmay cause losses to all and lead to increasing hostility. \r\nLikewise, the unilateral embargo on the Republic of \r\nCuba — a sovereign State — for many decades has had \r\na major impact on the lives of the peace-loving Cuban \r\npeople. Therefore, it is now time to lift the embargo.\r\nIn this complex and challenging global environment, \r\nthe United Nations, the only universal organization, \r\nunder the leadership of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, has made tireless efforts to seek ways and \r\nmeans to address these international issues, promote \r\ncooperation for sustainable development and poverty \r\neradication and maintain peace, stability and security \r\nin the world. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto commend the Secretary-General for his various \r\ninitiatives in addressing issues of common concern, \r\nincluding the organization of the Climate Summit, \r\nwhich has just been successfully concluded.\r\nNevertheless, amid complex and unpredictable \r\ncircumstances, the United Nations needs to strengthen \r\nitself through the reform of various organs so that it \r\ncan more effectively carry out its mandate and fulfil \r\nits obligations. The international community is hoping \r\nto see further tangible progress next year on the \r\nreform of the United Nations, on the occasion marking \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the founding of the \r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) is a regional organization that has enjoyed \r\nrapid growth, and all ASEAN-initiated mechanisms \r\nare bearing fruitful results. We are therefore convinced \r\nthat ASEAN community-building in 2015 will be \r\nsuccessful, turning ASEAN into a single market and \r\nproduction base with increased competitiveness, thus \r\npromoting trade and investment in the region and \r\nbetween ASEAN and its external partners. ASEAN is \r\nnow earnestly mapping out the ASEAN Community \r\nPost-2015 Vision, aimed at strengthening and ensuring \r\nASEAN unity while promoting peace and security in the \r\nregion and the world at large. On that note, we hope that \r\nthe international community will continue to support \r\nthe implementation of the ASEAN Community Post-\r\n2015 Vision, as well as the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic’s ASEAN chairmanship in 2016, after ASEAN \r\nbecomes a Community.\r\nLandlocked developing countries (LLDCs) compose \r\none of the groups of countries in special situations that \r\nare recognized by the international community. After \r\n10 years of implementation of the Almaty Programme of \r\nAction on addressing the specific problems and special \r\nneeds of LLDCs, it has been noted that many objectives \r\nhave not been realized, thus those countries continue to \r\nface daunting challenges and marginalization in many \r\nareas.\r\nMore than half of the LLDCs are also least developed \r\ncountries. In that context, the second United Nations \r\nConference on Landlocked Developing Countries, to be \r\nheld in November in Vienna, is of great significance \r\nto LLDCs, as it will conduct the 10-year review of the \r\nimplementation of Almaty Programme of Action and \r\nadopt a new programme of action for the next decade. \r\nOn that note, we would like to call upon all stakeholders, \r\nincluding transit countries and development partners, \r\nto participate actively in the Conference with a view to \r\nensuring its successful outcome. Also, we call on the \r\ninternational community to support the implementation \r\nof the new programme of action in order to help \r\nthose countries overcome their special problems and \r\nchallenges and achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe year 2015 will mark the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the founding of the United Nations. We hope that \r\nthe international community will spare no effort in \r\nbuilding a peaceful, secure and prosperous world.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nShaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain.\r\nShaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) \r\n(spoke in Arabic): At the outset, it gives me great \r\npleasure to congratulate you warmly, Mr. President, \r\nand, through you, your friendly country Uganda upon \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session. I take this opportunity to wish \r\nyou luck and success in the noble mission entrusted to \r\nyou, and I affirm the Kingdom of Bahrain’s support \r\nfor your judicious proposal regarding the formulation \r\n24/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nand adoption of a post-2015 development agenda that \r\nwill build on past achievements in the context of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) for the well-\r\nbeing of all people.\r\nIt would be remiss of me not to commend your \r\npredecessor, Ambassador John Ashe, for his excellent \r\nconduct of the work of the Assembly during its sixty-\r\neighth session and his outstanding and successful \r\nefforts.\r\nWe also greatly appreciate the efforts of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to revitalize and strengthen the \r\nOrganization’s role and to realize its objectives in all \r\nfields. I commend the report he introduced earlier in the \r\ncurrent session on the work of the Organization (A/69/1). \r\nIt demonstrates the daunting responsibility assumed by \r\nour Organization in creating an environment conducive \r\nto seeking appropriate solutions to the problems and \r\nchallenges that we all face.\r\nThe inaugural statement by the Secretary-General \r\nat the opening of the general debate (see A/69/PV.6) shed \r\nlight on a number of the challenges facing us, including \r\nclimate change, the spread of diseases, particularly the \r\nEbola epidemic in West Africa, the aggravated refugee \r\nproblem, the propagation of extremism, policies \r\nof exclusion, violence, violations of human rights, \r\nparticularly those affecting women, and issues related \r\nto health, education and food security.\r\nMy country supports the Secretary-General’s \r\nurgent call to conclude a global climate agreement at the \r\nforthcoming Lima and Paris conferences and stresses \r\nthe importance of the Green Climate Fund, designed to \r\nmitigate the effects of climate change.\r\nIt is a matter of particular pride for me to mention \r\nthe vigorous efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain and the resulting successes in countering \r\nthe numerous challenges and instability currently \r\nfacing the region. As classified by the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) 2014 Human \r\nDevelopment Report — which is based on objective \r\nstatistical criteria regarding, first and foremost, health \r\ncare, education, per capita income and the equality of \r\nwomen — the Kingdom of Bahrain is ranked among the \r\ncountries with “very high human development”. That is \r\na status achieved through persistent hard work, and we \r\nwill endeavour to maintain it.\r\nThose goals, however, have never been an end in \r\nthemselves. The principal objective is to achieve the \r\nwell-being of Bahraini citizens and to protect all those \r\nwho live within the borders of the Kingdom, an oasis of \r\nsecurity and calm enjoyed equally by all.\r\nI am pleased to recall in that context the award \r\nbestowed on His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa \r\nby the Foundation for Coexistence among Religions in \r\nrecognition of His Majesty’s outstanding contributions \r\nin the field of dialogue among civilizations and \r\ncultures. I also note that the fourteenth Conference on \r\nAll Civilizations in the Service of Humanity was held in \r\nManama in early May under the high-level patronage of \r\nHis Majesty the King and with the participation of the \r\nUnited Nations and a distinguished group of thinkers, \r\nscholars and opinion-makers. The Conference adopted \r\nthe Bahrain Declaration, which has been circulated and \r\ndeposited as an official document of the United Nations \r\n(A/68/959, annex).\r\nAdditionally, I would like to mention His Majesty’s \r\ninitiative to establish an Arab human rights tribunal. \r\nThe initiative has been approved by all States members \r\nof the League of Arab States, and the statute has been \r\nadopted. I would also like to mention the launch in \r\nBahrain in November 2013 of the UNDP report Water \r\nGovernance in the Arab Region, which calls for the \r\nadoption of a joint Arab water-management strategy.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has continued to play an \r\nenergetic role in the United Nations system, where it \r\nseeks to further progress through gradual and steady \r\nreform and modernization along the lines envisaged by \r\nHis Majesty the King. Such reform would be based on a \r\nstrategy of common denominators, continuous and open \r\ndialogue and a national exchange of views — the same \r\nstrategy as led to the early achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Accordingly, the strategies and \r\npreparations for the post-2015 development agenda are \r\nalso based on tireless work, determination, persistence, \r\ngood faith and comprehensive planning and are aimed \r\nat promoting continual and enhanced progress and \r\nserving the interests of the Kingdom’s citizens and \r\nresidents alike.\r\nOur region is going through a phase of extreme \r\ndifficulty — probably the most difficult in its modern \r\nhistory — in which a climate of instability, chaos, \r\ntension and savage, bloody and unprecedented terrorism \r\nprevails. Of the many contributing factors, the most \r\nsalient are the following.\r\nFirst, the accelerated emergence of terrorist groups \r\nof various global dimensions and affiliations. They \r\n14-55181 25/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nthrive in our region, exhibiting the greatest savagery \r\nand callousness. Not only do they target innocent \r\npeople in general, they also engage in such inhumane \r\npractices as mass murder, public beheadings and the \r\npersecution of ethnic and religious minorities, which \r\nthey displace, destroying their cultural heritage, \r\ndepriving them of religious freedom and causing them \r\nto f lee their homes. They attack entire cities and declare \r\nwar on sovereign countries in regional and international \r\nsettings, in complete disregard of all religious doctrines \r\nand the intrinsic human values — tolerance, equality, \r\nmoderation and respect for cultural diversity — that \r\nhave enabled human civilizations, including our Arab \r\nand Islamic civilization, to coexist. These terrorist \r\ngroups — they include Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Hizbullah, and their \r\nextensions and counterparts — recruit their fighters \r\nfrom both East and West and perpetrate horrific terrorist \r\nacts. The young and the old alike are killed, women are \r\ntaken as war bounty, families are displaced and privacy \r\nis violated, the objective being to undermine security, \r\npropagate anarchy and topple regimes.\r\nTherefore, combating terrorist groups requires \r\nus to work together in three main areas. The first of \r\nthese is the security and military area, owing to the \r\nworsening threat posed by these terrorist groups as they \r\nacquire heavy weapons, enabling them to occupy cities \r\nfor use as safe havens and bases from which to launch \r\nthe terrorist operations that disrupt the stability and \r\nsecurity of our region.\r\nWe share a common responsibility with friendly \r\ncountries and our allies is to eradicate the terrorist group \r\nof ISIL. To that end, our air force, in collaboration with \r\nthese countries, has targeted a number of ISIL positions. \r\nWe welcome Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), \r\nadopted on 24 September, which focuses on stopping \r\nthe recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters. Also, we \r\ncontinue to closely monitor borders and exit and entry \r\npoints so as to stop citizens of the Kingdom from \r\ncontacting or joining terrorist groups and to arrest and \r\nprosecute all those who have allegedly been affiliated \r\nto them as soon as they return to the country.\r\nSecondly, we must combat all ideology that runs \r\ncounter to human nature and betrays true Islam by \r\ndistorting its precepts. Muslim clerics and scholars can \r\nplay an important part in counteracting such distortion. \r\nWe therefore call on all Muslim scholars to expose and \r\ndisown ideas that are not related to Islam in any way, \r\nand we appreciate their playing a leading role in that \r\nrespect. It is imperative to stand together in the face of \r\nthe ideas propagated by the terrorist groups.\r\nThirdly, we must deal with financing, as it \r\nconstitutes the lifeline of the terrorist groups, enabling \r\nthem to perpetrate their barbaric acts, purchase \r\nweapons and influence some young people. In that \r\nconnection, the Kingdom of Bahrain will convene \r\na high-level international conference during the \r\nfirst week of November to consider the financing of \r\nterrorism, how best to combat such financing and how \r\nto deprive terrorism of its sources of finance. We firmly \r\nbelieve that preventing the financing of terrorism will \r\nsignificantly contribute to overcoming terrorism and to \r\neradicating it.\r\nThe second challenge to the security and stability of \r\nour region is that of political expansionism and attempts \r\nto impose hegemony, in disregard of the sovereignty \r\nof States, and to interfere in their internal affairs. All \r\nthe countries of the region, without exception, have \r\nsuffered from such issues as a result of attempts to \r\nexport seditious revolutions and to train terrorists \r\nin violation of international law and the principles \r\nof the United Nations. Such attempts represent an \r\nideology that is archaic in its political dimension and \r\nin its defiance of the values and principles enshrined in \r\nnumerous international instruments.\r\nOne form of such interference is the exploitation of \r\nthe media, in particular satellite television channels and \r\nsocial media, which are misused in order to distort facts \r\nand to cause instability in the region. We condemn such \r\nillegal and illegitimate practices, which contravene \r\ninternational values and principles.\r\nI would like to point out what the Republic of \r\nYemen endures. With each step that it takes forward, \r\nterrorist groups rush to pursue their criminal objectives \r\nby undermining its stability and security. The Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain reaffirms its support for President Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour and his tireless efforts to \r\nstrengthen the national consensus achieved through a \r\ncomprehensive national dialogue on the basis of the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council initiative and the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nTurning to Iraq, which has suffered from flagrant \r\ninterference, insecurity, hegemony and anarchy, we see \r\nsome hope in the positive developments in the country. \r\nWe are pleased to welcome the election of President Fuad \r\nMasum and the establishment of the new Government \r\nunder Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. We hope \r\n26/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nthat such a development will enhance the political \r\nand development processes, thereby contributing to \r\nthe consolidation of Iraq’s security and stability, the \r\npreservation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nand the strengthening of its links with its fellow Arabs \r\nin the region where it naturally belongs.\r\nThe conflict in Syria becomes more complex and \r\nmore acute every year. Innocent civilians are paying \r\nthe ultimate price and losing their lives, property and \r\ndignity. The humanitarian situation deteriorates daily \r\nin the absence of a comprehensive political solution to \r\nsafeguard the lives of the Syrian people and to extricate \r\nthat beloved country from its protracted suffering \r\nthrough a comprehensive political process aimed at \r\nachieving reform and political plurality. With regard to \r\nthe humanitarian aspect, we reiterate that it is necessary \r\nto overcome all impediments to the delivery of \r\nhumanitarian assistance to those in need, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn that respect, I wish to express my country’s \r\ngreat appreciation for the humanity shown by the \r\nsisterly Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in hosting \r\nand delivering assistance to Syrian refugees. We also \r\nappreciate the humanitarian role played by Turkey and \r\nLebanon, as well as by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nWith regard to the Arab Republic of Egypt, \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain welcomes the democratic \r\ndevelopment that has taken place in that country \r\nand the implementation of the road map through the \r\nestablishment of a Constitution that reflects the will of \r\nthe Egyptian people. We also welcome the presidential \r\nelections and the ongoing preparations for the holding \r\nof legislative elections so as to complete the State \r\ninstitutions under the Constitution.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its complete \r\ncondemnation of any interference in the internal affairs \r\nof Egypt. We support the efforts of President Abdel \r\nFattah Al Sisi and the steps that he has taken to combat \r\nterrorism, to preserve the security and stability of \r\nEgypt and to pursue its strategic and active role at the \r\nArab, regional and international levels. In that regard, \r\nI would like to commend the initiative taken by the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah \r\nBin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, King of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia, in announcing the convening of an Egyptian \r\neconomic summit in support of Egypt and its economic \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe reiterate the historical, principled and constant \r\nposition of the Kingdom of Bahrain in solidarity with \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco and our full support for its \r\ninitiatives with regard to self-government for the \r\nMoroccan Sahara within Moroccan sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, in accordance with international \r\nlegitimacy.\r\nWith regard to Libya, the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nwishes to express its grave concern about the \r\ndeteriorating security situation as a result of the \r\nviolent acts perpetrated by terrorist groups and \r\nthe repercussions of such acts on the stability of \r\nneighbouring countries. The Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nsupports the legitimate constitutional institutions \r\nrepresented by the elected House of Representatives \r\nand welcomes the establishment of the new Government \r\nunder Mr. Abdallah Al-Thani. We hope that such a \r\ndevelopment will help to establish security and stability \r\nand to preserve the unity and territorial integrity of that \r\nsisterly country.\r\nIn view of our keen interest in striving to achieve \r\nour principal goal, namely, to protect humankind \r\nfrom the scourge of war, conflict and disaster and to \r\ncondemn attempts at hegemony and destabilization, we \r\nreiterate our call to make the Middle East, including \r\nthe Arab Gulf region, a zone free of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons. On the basis \r\nof that principle, we support the efforts of the P5+1 \r\nto promptly find a solution to the issue of the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme, in accordance with the provisions \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons and the Convention on Nuclear Safety, without \r\nprejudice to the use of nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. Such use is a natural right of all States under \r\nthe international safeguards system.\r\nThe third and last challenge is the illegal occupation \r\nof the territory of other States in breach of the principles \r\nof international law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations, as demonstrated by Israel’s violation of all \r\ninternational laws, agreements and decisions and its \r\ntargeting of the Palestinian people by confiscating their \r\nland, by building or expanding settlements thereon and \r\nby imposing blockades on them. Such violations found \r\ntheir ugliest expression in the most recent criminal \r\naggression against the Gaza Strip, which resulted in \r\ntremendous damage and caused the death of more than \r\n2,000 martyrs, the displacement of a great number of \r\nPalestinians and the destruction of infrastructure.\r\n14-55181 27/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nI would like to recall the words of \r\nPresident Mahmoud Abbas in his statement before \r\nthe General Assembly, his request that international \r\nprotection be provided to the Palestinian people and \r\ntheir territories under occupation and his demand that \r\nIsrael abide by the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 \r\n(see A/69/PV.12). It is imperative to have a specific \r\ntime frame for an end to the Israeli occupation and to \r\nachieve the aspirations of the Palestinian people for the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State on \r\nall its territory within the boundaries of 4 June 1967, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, as stipulated under \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution, \r\nin accordance with international legitimacy and the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nIn that context, we commend the pivotal role \r\nplayed by the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to \r\nreach a ceasefire in Gaza. We greatly appreciate its \r\nhosting, in cooperation with the Kingdom of Norway, \r\nan international conference in support of Palestine and \r\nthe reconstruction of the Gaza Strip next month. We \r\nalso commend the important role of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East.\r\nWith regard to the occupation by the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran of the three islands Greater Tunb, \r\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which belong to the United \r\nArab Emirates, the Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its \r\nconsistent position condemning that occupation. We \r\ncall on Iran to heed the efforts of the United Arab \r\nEmirates to resolve the issue through direct negotiations \r\nor through the arbitration of the International Court of \r\nJustice.\r\nThose are the key challenges facing our region. \r\nIf we overcome them, it will be relatively easy for us, \r\nwithin our common responsibilities, to address the \r\ninternational challenges that the Secretary-General \r\ndescribed in his statement, to which I referred at the \r\nbeginning of my statement. If we focus on those very \r\nserious issues, we will be on the right path towards true \r\nsustainable development and the necessary reform to \r\nmeet the aspirations of all peoples.\r\nNotwithstanding the challenges that we all face, the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain will always remain committed to \r\nmoving forward on the path of development, reform and \r\npositive interaction with the international community \r\nin order to achieve our aspirations and objectives. In \r\nthat respect, the Kingdom of Bahrain, in line with its \r\nfirm approach towards reform under the leadership \r\nof His Majesty the King, will continue to work for \r\nthe upholding of the rule of law, pluralism and active \r\npolitical participation. We look forward to the elections \r\nto be held on 22 November, so as to consolidate all our \r\nachievements.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underscore the \r\nfact that in the Kingdom of Bahrain our choices are \r\nclear. Our vision is comprehensive and our strategy \r\ncomplementary to and in line with our Gulf, Arab and \r\ninternational contexts. The Kingdom always seeks to \r\npromote stability, peace, security, development and the \r\nprotection of human rights. It rejects and condemns \r\nterrorism, violence and hatred and works for a society \r\nin which harmony and consensus prevail for the benefit \r\nof all and for the establishment of a promising future \r\nfull of opportunity and achievement for all future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nMinister for Education and Minister for Cultural \r\nAffairs of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): This has been an \r\nenormously difficult year for the United Nations. As \r\nthe Secretary-General has pointed out, we are living \r\nin an era of an unprecedented level of crises. I echo \r\nhis call for leaders to unite. At a time when the world \r\nseems to be breaking apart, it will serve us well to \r\nremember what unites us. We need to look no further \r\nthan the Charter of the United Nations. The preamble \r\nto the Charter offers a vision that seems so difficult \r\nfor us to fulfil: we are determined “to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war”.\r\nThe Organization was created, above all, to prevent \r\nwar. Indeed, it offers a system of collective security that \r\nis far more effective than anything that existed before. \r\nYet the events over the past year have shaken its very \r\nfoundations. At times, it seems that we revert to the \r\nhabits of past centuries. We are disturbed by the acts \r\nof aggression perpetrated against Ukraine and by the \r\nillegal annexation of parts of its territory. Those acts \r\nare massive violations of the principles on which the \r\nOrganization was built. They are a major setback for \r\ncollective security. As a small country situated in the \r\nheart of Europe and a member of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, we hope that we \r\ncan quickly re-establish a consensus on security issues \r\nin Europe.\r\n28/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nThe events in Ukraine also underline the need \r\nto ensure the enforcement of international law — if \r\nnecessary in a court of law. We now, for the first time since \r\nthe Nuremberg Tribunal, have a historic opportunity to \r\ncriminalize the most serious forms of the illegal use \r\nof force in an international court. Jurisdiction for the \r\ncrime of aggression before the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) will be possible as early as 2017. The \r\nratification process of the Kampala amendments is well \r\non track. I welcome the ratifications by Latvia, Poland \r\nand Spain just a few days ago. We look forward to \r\nachieving that goal, together with the largest possible \r\nnumber of partners.\r\nFor truly collective work to maintain peace and \r\nsecurity, we need a collective sense of purpose. That \r\nis difficult to reconcile with the notion that a single \r\nSecurity Council member is able to block the action \r\nrequired if the United Nations is to fulfil its purposes \r\nand principles — with no questions asked, no matter \r\nhow large the majority in favour of such action. We \r\nof course accept the veto as a reality of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, as we did when we joined the \r\nOrganization. However, we do not accept that the veto \r\nshould be used in a manner that contradicts the very \r\npurposes of the United Nations. We have witnessed too \r\nmany such instances in recent times. Change is urgently \r\nneeded. We therefore look for a commitment from \r\nStates serving on the Council not to vote against any \r\naction necessary to prevent or to end crimes of atrocity. \r\nWe look to the permanent members in particular to give \r\na clear commitment to that end.\r\nWe are determined to reaffirm faith in fundamental \r\nhuman rights and in the dignity and worth of the human \r\nperson. The United Nations, created as a family of \r\nnations, has the rights and dignity of the individual \r\nat the centre of its efforts. This is a human rights \r\norganization. The General Assembly, which we have \r\nentrusted to your leadership, Mr. President, during \r\nthis session, is also a human rights organ. The world is \r\nchanging at an ever-increasing speed. That requires our \r\ncontinued commitment to human rights.\r\nThe right to privacy, for example, is at risk of \r\nbeing lost. The digital era makes large-scale data \r\ncollection both easy to undertake and difficult to \r\ndetect. Discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual \r\norientation, nationality, ethnicity, religion, disability or \r\nany other status remains rampant in many parts of the \r\nworld.\r\nThe rise of religious intolerance is especially \r\nalarming. Conflicts around the world are characterized \r\nby the persecution of religious minorities, be they \r\nShiites, Yazidis, Christians or others. We are witnessing \r\na disturbing rise in anti-Semitism. The Assembly should \r\nrespond by uniting in a call against the persecution of \r\nany religious minority anywhere in the world. I am also \r\nparticularly alarmed about the rising violence against \r\nhuman rights defenders, such as the recent murder \r\nof Samira Saleh Al-Nuaimi, an Iraqi activist and the \r\nmother of three children. There is nothing Islamic \r\nabout that barbaric act, committed by the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\r\nIn times of conflict, international humanitarian \r\nlaw represents our hope for at least the bare minimum \r\nof human dignity. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are \r\namong not only the greatest achievements in the history \r\nof international law but also the most successful treaties \r\nwith their near-universal acceptance. Nevertheless, their \r\ncore principles — proportionality in the use of force and \r\na distinction between civilians and combatants — are \r\nviolated on a daily basis. The recent conflict in Gaza \r\nwas carried out at the expense of civilians by both \r\nparties to the conflict. The civilian population of Syria \r\nhas been experiencing enormous suffering for more \r\nthan three years now. Atrocities have been committed \r\nagainst men, women and children by the regime and, \r\nincreasingly, by other actors. Humanitarian access has \r\nbeen blocked systematically as a method of warfare. \r\nCivilians in both Syria and Iraq are left at the mercy \r\nof the sickening brutality of ISIL. There has rarely \r\nbeen a time when civilians were at greater risk of being \r\nvictimized by atrocity crimes. We are not living up to \r\nour promise, made some 10 years ago, to collectively \r\nensure protection against such crimes.\r\nWe are determined to reaffirm faith in the equal \r\nrights of men and women. Equality between men and \r\nwomen was one of the first things on the minds of the \r\ndrafters of the Charter of the United Nations just after \r\nthe end of the Second World War. Is that not striking? \r\nWe have certainly achieved much since then. The \r\n1995 Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women in \r\nparticular was a watershed moment in that regard. The \r\ncommemoration of its twentieth anniversary is the \r\nbest opportunity for us to show that we remain fully \r\ncommitted to its outcome.\r\nNext year we will also reflect on our progress on \r\nthe women, peace and security agenda 15 years after it \r\nwas established under Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n14-55181 29/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\n(2000). Clearly, we will have to find new strategies to \r\nprotect women in conflict from violence, in particular \r\nsexual violence. We are still far from using the full \r\npotential of women as agents of peace. Men have \r\nalways been in charge of making war and of making \r\npeace: their record is not impressive. Women must \r\nobtain their seat at the negotiating table, where they \r\nbelong and where they are needed. I am grateful to the \r\nSecretary-General for taking the lead on that issue and \r\nfor increasingly appointing women to high positions in \r\nthe areas of mediation and conflict resolution.\r\nWe are determined to establish conditions in which \r\njustice and respect for the obligations arising from \r\ntreaties and other sources of international law can \r\nbe maintained. Justice and the rule of law are areas \r\nwhere we have made important progress. International \r\ncourts and other judicial mechanisms are gaining \r\ngreater acceptance. Calls for accountability are \r\nbecoming louder. We can look to an impressive body of \r\ninternational jurisprudence.\r\nThat is particularly true for the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). Victims of the gravest crimes \r\naround the world place their hopes for justice in the \r\nRome Statute system. That is a great responsibility \r\nfor the Court, an institution which frequently works in \r\na politically charged context. Those who support the \r\nCourt must make that support felt. For that reason, I \r\nhave initiated an informal network of ministers who \r\nsupport the ICC personally as politicians. Our network \r\nhas grown to 26 members. We stand ready to defend the \r\nCourt and the integrity of the Rome Statute, because we \r\nknow that political attacks against the ICC are easy to \r\nlaunch but difficult to respond to.\r\nThe fact that the Court is an entirely independent \r\ninstitution that follows the law, not politics, does not \r\nmake the headlines. The fact that the ICC has jurisdiction \r\nin some places but not in others is easily misrepresented \r\nas selectivity. Our goal therefore remains for the Rome \r\nStatute to become a universal treaty. Victims of crimes \r\nin Syria, Iraq, Palestine and North Korea — to cite just \r\na few examples — deserve their day in court as much as \r\nthose in other parts of the world.\r\nWe are determined to promote social progress \r\nand better standards of life in larger freedom. There \r\ncould not be a greater challenge for the Assembly than \r\nsetting the global agenda for sustainable development \r\nfor the next generation. And there could not be a greater \r\nopportunity to show its relevance.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals were a \r\nsuccess. They set the agenda for more than a decade, \r\ngalvanized tremendous efforts for development and led \r\nto very significant advances. However, they were also \r\na learning process. We must be honest about where we \r\nhave failed and do better where we can. Three areas \r\nstand out in that respect.\r\nFirst, accountable institutions, access to justice and \r\nan effective fight against corruption are key ingredients \r\nof development that are truly transformative and \r\nsustainable. That is amply illustrated by national \r\nexperiences around the world and is well documented \r\nby research. Placing the rule of law at the heart of the \r\nsustainable development goal agenda will therefore be \r\none key of success.\r\nSecondly, there is no sustainable development \r\nwithout the full empowerment of women. Nothing \r\nshort of full equality between men and women will be \r\nrequired for development to be sustainable. We must \r\ntherefore fully recognize the empowerment of women \r\nas a key ingredient of sustainable development.\r\nThirdly, the implementation of international \r\ncommitments cannot be left to chance. We need \r\naccountability. We must establish a system to monitor \r\nprogress in the implementation of the post-2015 \r\nagenda, carried out by us as States but involving all \r\nstakeholders. The High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development is the best anchor for such a \r\nsystem.\r\nOur work to date in developing the post-2015 agenda \r\ngives us cause to be optimistic. Let us make the best use \r\nof the upcoming months to produce an agenda of which \r\nwe can be truly proud as a platform for collective action \r\nand an inspiration for future generations.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Erlan Abdyldayev, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Abdyldayev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFirst of all, allow me to congratulate you, Sir, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session and to wish you every success \r\nin carrying out that important task. It is also a great \r\npleasure to express my gratitude to Mr. John Ashe for \r\nhis successful and fruitful guidance of the previous \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nThe current situation in the world vividly \r\ndemonstrates that the ongoing instability, increasing \r\n30/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\ndisputes among the leading world Powers and the absence \r\nof a clear and comprehensible vision for the future of the \r\nworld order have become part of our everyday life. War, \r\nconflict, a refusal to listen to one another and unilateral \r\naction are pushing the international community ever \r\ncloser to the precipice. Such developments undermine \r\nour efforts to work together effectively to address \r\ntoday’s threats and challenges. It is no surprise that \r\nvarious terrorist and extremist groups are cunningly \r\ntaking advantage of the prevailing political vacuum and \r\nfierce opposition among world and regional Powers in \r\norder not only to insinuate and assert their presence, but \r\nalso to demonstrate their ability to directly influence \r\nthe situation around the world.\r\nTherefore, the role of the United Nations as a \r\nplatform for comprehensive dialogue is becoming ever \r\nmore important. Kyrgyzstan has consistently advocated \r\nthe further strengthening of the central coordinating \r\nrole of the United Nations in international affairs so \r\nas to maintain peace, security and stability; to promote \r\nshared sustainable and constructive development; and \r\nto encourage broad international cooperation. We \r\nbelieve that the ongoing and emerging sources of global \r\ninstability require a strengthened role for the United \r\nNations in every possible way. The relevance of political \r\nand diplomatic conflict resolution is reconfirmed by \r\nthe situations in Afghanistan, the Sahel, East and West \r\nAfrica, Ukraine and Syria. In order to overcome the \r\nthreats and challenges to peace, prosperity and creative \r\ndevelopment, we should firmly and resolutely move \r\nforward by uniting the efforts of the entire international \r\ncommunity. Kyrgyzstan expresses its full readiness \r\nto participate in such constructive and effective \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of such negative global \r\npolitical developments, the further strengthening of \r\nhuman rights principles and of the rule of law, based on \r\nconstructive approaches and cooperation, is becoming \r\nall the more relevant. For Kyrgyzstan, these principles \r\nare an integral part of political development. The \r\nupcoming parliamentary and presidential elections in \r\nKyrgyzstan, in 2015 and 2017, will serve as an important \r\nstep in strengthening the democratic foundations of our \r\ncountry. We hope that the international community \r\nwill provide effective assistance to Kyrgyzstan in \r\nimplementing its far-reaching goals. In line with our \r\ncommitment to democratic principles and the desire to \r\nmake a further contribution to the dialogue on global \r\ndemocracy, Kyrgyzstan has announced its candidacy \r\nfor the Human Rights Council for the period of 2016-\r\n2018. We count on the support of members of the \r\nAssembly in that regard.\r\nThe world today is at a difficult juncture, marked \r\nby increasing regional and international instability. All \r\nnations, regardless of their geographical location, face \r\nsimilar security challenges. Our region, in this regard, \r\nis no exception. It is obvious that the most serious \r\nexternal challenge to Central Asia remains the situation \r\nin Afghanistan, as well as the threats of terrorism, \r\nextremism and drug trafficking emanating from that \r\ncountry.\r\nAs in the past, problems related to illegal drug-\r\ntrafficking as a direct consequence of the situation in \r\nAfghanistan are among the most severe in the entire \r\nregion. We are especially alarmed by the continuing \r\nstrong link between terrorism and illegal Afghan drugs, \r\nwhich undermine the achievements in Afghanistan’s \r\nsecurity situation and its ability to ensure law and order \r\nthroughout the country. In this regard, it is necessary \r\nto pool efforts with the United Nations to promote \r\nsecurity and stability in Afghanistan.\r\nIn order to effectively curb these threats, we call \r\nfor a more proactive international contribution, in order \r\nto strengthen the capacity of regional law-enforcement \r\nagencies and to promote regional cooperation. We \r\nattach particular importance to the Istanbul Process \r\nas an important dialogue in improving regional \r\ncooperation on Afghan issues. We count on the active \r\nparticipation of all parties in achieving practical \r\nresults. We hope that the establishment of the new \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan by Mr. Ashraf Ghani and \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah will be the starting point for the \r\nfuture stabilization in that war-weary country.\r\nAnother important factor for regional instability \r\nis the unresolved border issue in Central Asia. \r\nUndoubtedly, a successful solution is in the best \r\ninterests of all States of the region. The solution would \r\ngreatly contribute to enhancing the regional transit \r\npotential of our countries, developing cross-border \r\ninfrastructure, improving the economic situation and \r\ndecreasing social tension. In this regard, I call on all \r\nCentral Asian States to support the recent initiative of \r\nthe President of Kyrgyzstan, Mr. Almazbek Atambaev, \r\non the development and subsequent signing of bilateral \r\nagreements on border-related confidence-building, as \r\nput forward at the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization held in Dushanbe. I am confident that \r\n14-55181 31/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nthe successful implementation of that initiative would \r\nlet us take historic steps towards the development of \r\nregional economic and trade relations, as well as in \r\njointly maintaining regional stability.\r\nAmid the turmoil sweeping through the Middle \r\nEast, it is especially important to focus our attention \r\non the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, \r\nwhich we view as the major destabilizing factor for the \r\nregion and the world. The use of force leads only to \r\nfurther bloodshed, destruction and hatred and does not \r\nsolve any problem. In order to revive mutual trust, the \r\nconflict must be resolved by exclusively political and \r\ndiplomatic means, on the basis of relevant resolutions \r\nof the Security Council.\r\nThe theme of the present general debate, “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”, is both timely and relevant. Next \r\nyear, at the seventieth anniversary session of the United \r\nNations, we will need to formulate and adopt new goals \r\nfor the following 15 years. The evolving situation today \r\nillustrates that many countries, including Kyrgyzstan, \r\nare unlikely to achieve all the objectives proposed in \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in the next year. We \r\nbelieve that the goals not achieved should be refined \r\nin the light of gained experience and they should find \r\nproper reflection in the post-2015 goals for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe advocate including countries with special \r\ndevelopment needs on the agenda of the post-2015 \r\nagenda. Kyrgyzstan falls into such a category. Ours \r\nis a developing, landlocked and mountainous State \r\nthat is highly vulnerable to climate change. It is well \r\nknown that extreme poverty in Kyrgyzstan has many \r\ncauses, foremost among them a disadvantageous \r\ngeographical location. More than 70 per cent of our \r\nterritory is mountainous. The country lies 5,000 \r\nmetres above sea level, with approximately one third \r\nof its total area lying 400 metres above sea level. Such \r\nStates are characterized by remoteness, inaccessibility, \r\ninformational isolation, severe geoclimatic conditions \r\nand a high cost of living.\r\nFor Kyrgyzstan, the absence of access to the sea \r\nis yet another factor having a restrictive effect on \r\nour economic development. Remoteness from major \r\ninternational transport networks and high transportation \r\ncosts hinder the development of multi-vector and \r\ndiversified international economic relations and the \r\nimplementation of the country’s large-scale investment \r\nprojects. We believe that the establishment of an \r\ninternational development fund to provide support and \r\nassistance for the economies of developing landlocked \r\ncountries would contribute to their sustainable \r\neconomic development. This is especially important \r\nin the run-up to the second United Nations Conference \r\non Landlocked Developing Countries, to be held in \r\nVienna, where a new programme of action for the next \r\ndecade should be adopted.\r\nThe year 2015 will be a milestone for the entire \r\nworld community. In addition to the adoption of the \r\npost-2015 agenda, we anticipate the adoption of an \r\ninternational legally binding instrument on climate \r\nchange. On 23 September, on the margins of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the United Nations Summit on \r\nClimate Change was held, at which States outlined \r\ntheir vision for a solution incorporating adaptation to \r\nand mitigation of climate change. For Kyrgyzstan, as \r\nfor all mountainous countries whose ecosystems are \r\nhighly sensitive to climate change, these issues are of \r\npriority importance on the national agenda. Abruptly \r\nmelting glaciers, rising temperatures, soil degradation, \r\nlandslides, mudflows and f loods cause significant \r\neconomic damage and serve as vivid reminders of \r\nthe vulnerability of mountain ecosystems. According \r\nto reliable forecasts, Kyrgyzstan’s ice cover could be \r\nreduced by 40 per cent by 2025, leading to a one third \r\ndrop in the water available in the region. In that regard, \r\nconscious of the undoubted interconnections between \r\nthe environment, climate change and sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, we believe that it is essential that \r\nthe interests of vulnerable countries be adequately and \r\nfairly reflected in future action at the global level.\r\nSpeaking of regional problems in Central Asia, I \r\nshould note that dealing as we are with global challenges \r\nsuch as climate change, the potential threat of an \r\nenergy crisis and population growth, water resources \r\nare a key factor in prosperity, and in that regard, our \r\nbasic position is that the issues of water resources and \r\nenergy are indissolubly linked and inseparable from \r\neach other. It is crucial to understand that hydropower \r\ndevelopment is an essential precondition for our \r\nsustainable development. That is entirely consistent \r\nwith the Secretary-General’s initiative in declaring \r\nthe period between 2014 and 2024 the Decade of \r\nSustainable Energy for All. It is clear that access to \r\nmodern, affordable and environmentally friendly \r\nenergy supplies is essential if developing countries are \r\n32/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nto achieve global development goals, including those \r\nin the Millennium Declaration. The issue of affordable \r\nenergy should unquestionably be appropriately \r\nreflected in the new world agenda of the United Nations \r\npost-2015.\r\nThe recovery and secure storage of uranium tailings \r\nin Kyrgyzstan remains a serious transboundary problem \r\nfor Central Asia. Most are concentrated in densely \r\npopulated areas, and their condition has deteriorated in \r\nthe last 10 years in the wake of closings of industrial \r\nenterprises and major production facilities. Moreover, \r\na large part of these tailings are at risk of exposure to \r\nlandslides and f loods, as they are located in seismically \r\nactive regions near the banks of Central Asia’s major \r\ntransboundary rivers. Despite my Government’s efforts \r\nat the national level, along with the support of various \r\ninternational programmes and projects, the serious \r\nsocial, economic and environmental problems related \r\nto these issues continue. I would therefore like to urge \r\nthe international community to assist Kyrgyzstan \r\nin dealing with this problem of radioactive and toxic \r\nwaste through full rehabilitation of the contaminated \r\nareas, as envisioned in resolution 68/218, on the role of \r\nthe international community in averting the radiation \r\nthreat in Central Asia.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that no \r\nState can solve all the challenges it faces and maintain \r\nsustainable development in isolation. We cannot \r\nachieve our sustainable development goals and establish \r\nglobal order without the consolidated efforts of the \r\ninternational community. In that regard, I would like to \r\nassure the Assembly that Kyrgyzstan, in its partnership \r\nwith the United Nations, stands ready to contribute to \r\nthe search for new opportunities to solve the complex \r\nchallenges of our time, as well as to contribute to \r\nstrengthening stability and peace in the world.\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Public Affairs and the \r\nDiaspora of the State of Israel\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister of Public \r\nAffairs and the Diaspora of the State of Israel.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Public Affairs and the \r\nDiaspora of the State of Israel, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Netanyahu (Israel): I come here from \r\nJerusalem to speak on behalf of my people, the people \r\nof Israel. I have come to speak about the dangers we \r\nface and about the opportunities we seek. I have come \r\nto expose the brazen lies spoken from this very rostrum \r\nabout my country and the brave soldiers who defend it.\r\nThe people of Israel pray for peace, but our hopes \r\nfor peace, and those of the world, are in danger, because \r\neverywhere we look militant Islam is on the march. It \r\nis not militants; it is not Islam; it is militant Islam, and \r\ntypically, its first victims are other Muslims. But it \r\nspares no one. Christians, Jews, Yazidis, Kurds — no \r\ncreed, no faith, no ethnic group is beyond its sights, \r\nand it is rapidly spreading in every part of the world. \r\nWe know the famous American saying “All politics is \r\nlocal”. For the militant Islamists, all politics is global, \r\nbecause their ultimate goal is to dominate the world.\r\nNow that threat might seem exaggerated to some, \r\nsince it starts out small, like a cancer that attacks a \r\nparticular part of the body. But left unchecked, the \r\ncancer grows, metastasizing over wider and wider \r\nareas. To protect the peace and security of the world, \r\nwe must remove that cancer before it is too late. Last \r\nweek, many of the countries represented here rightly \r\napplauded President Obama for leading the effort \r\nto confront the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS); and yet weeks before, some of those same \r\ncountries — the same countries that now support \r\nconfronting ISIS — opposed Israel for confronting \r\nHamas. Evidently, they do not understand that ISIS and \r\nHamas are branches of the same poisonous tree.\r\nISIS and Hamas share a fanatical creed that they \r\nboth seek to impose well beyond the territory under their \r\ncontrol. Let us listen to what ISIS’s self-declared Caliph, \r\nAbu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, said two months ago. He said \r\nthat the day would soon come when the Muslim would \r\nwalk everywhere as a master, and that Muslims would \r\ncause the world to hear and understand the meaning of \r\nterrorism, and destroy the idol of democracy. Now let \r\nus listen to Khaled Mashal, the leader of Hamas. He \r\nproclaims a similar vision of the future. “We say this to \r\nthe West”, he says. “By Allah it will be defeated, and \r\ntomorrow our nation will sit on the throne of the world”.\r\nAs its Charter makes clear, Hamas’s immediate \r\ngoal is to destroy Israel; but it has a broader objective. \r\n14-55181 33/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nIt also wants a caliphate. Hamas shares the global \r\nambitions of its fellow militant Islamists, and that is \r\nwhy its supporters cheered wildly in the streets of Gaza \r\nwhen thousands of Americans were murdered on 9/11. \r\nThat is why its leaders condemned the United States \r\nfor killing Osama Bin Laden, whom they praised as a \r\nholy warrior. When it comes to their ultimate goals, \r\ntherefore, Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas.\r\nAnd what they share in common, all militant \r\nIslamists share in common — Boko Haram in Nigeria, \r\nAl-Shabaab in Somalia, Hizbullah in Lebanon, Al-Nusra \r\nin Syria, the Al-Mahdi Army in Iraq and the Al-Qaida \r\nbranches in Yemen, Libya, the Philippines, India and \r\nelsewhere. Some are radical Sunnis, some are radical \r\nShiites. Some want to restore a pre-medieval caliphate \r\nfrom the seventh century. Others want to trigger the \r\napocalyptic return of an imam from the ninth century.\r\nThey operate in different lands. They target \r\ndifferent victims. They even kill each other in their \r\nbattle for supremacy. But they all share a fanatic \r\nideology. They all seek to create ever expanding \r\nenclaves of militant Islam, where there is no freedom \r\nand no tolerance, where women are treated as chattel, \r\nChristians are decimated and minorities are subjugated, \r\nand sometimes given the stark choice: convert or die. \r\nFor them, anyone can be consider an infidel, including \r\nfellow Muslims.\r\nMilitant Islam’s ambition to dominate the world \r\nseems mad, but so too did the global ambitions of \r\nanother fanatic ideology that swept into power eight \r\ndecades ago. The Nazis believed in a master race. The \r\nmilitant Islamists believe in a master faith. They just \r\ndisagree as to who among them will be the master of \r\nthe master faith. That is what they truly disagree about. \r\nTherefore, the question before us is whether militant \r\nIslam will have the power to realize its unbridled \r\nambitions.\r\nThere is one place where that could soon \r\nhappen — the Islamic State of Iran. For 35 years, Iran \r\nhas relentlessly pursued the global mission that was set \r\nforth by its founding ruler, Ayatollah Khomeini, with \r\nthe following words:\r\n“We will export our revolution to the entire world, \r\nuntil the cry ‘There is no God but Allah’ will echo \r\nthroughout the world over”.\r\nEver since, the regime’s brutal enforcers, Iran’s \r\nRevolutionary Guards, have done exactly that. Let us \r\nlisten to its current commander, General Mohammad \r\nAli Jafari, who clearly stated that goal:\r\n“Our Imam did not limit the Islamic Revolution to \r\nthis country. Our duty is to prepare the way for an \r\nIslamic world Government.”\r\nIran’s president, Mr. Rouhani, stood here last \r\nweek and shed crocodile tears over what he called the \r\nglobalization of terrorism. Maybe he should spare us \r\nthose phony tears and have a word instead with the \r\ncommanders of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards. He could \r\nask them to call off Iran’s global terror campaign, \r\nwhich has included attacks in two dozen countries \r\non five continents since 2011 alone. To say that Iran \r\ndoes not practice terrorism is like saying Derek Jeter \r\nnever played shortstop for the New York Yankees. The \r\nbemoaning by the Iranian President of the spread of \r\nterrorism has got to be one of history’s greatest displays \r\nof double talk.\r\nSome argue that Iran’s global terror campaign — its \r\nsubversion of countries throughout the Middle East \r\nand well beyond the Middle East — is the work of the \r\nextremists. They say that things are changing. They \r\npoint to last year’s election in Iran. They claim that \r\nIran’s smooth-talking President and Foreign Minister \r\nhave changed not only the tone of Iran’s foreign policy \r\nbut also its substance. They believe that Rouhani and \r\nZarif generally want to reconcile with the West, that \r\nthey have abandoned the global mission of the Islamic \r\nRevolution. Really?\r\nLet us look at what Foreign Minister Zarif wrote in \r\nhis book just a few years ago:\r\n“We have a fundamental problem with the West, \r\nand especially with America. This is because we \r\nare heirs to a global mission which is tied to our \r\nraison d’être”.\r\n A global mission which is tied to our very \r\nreason for being? Then Zarif asks a question — an \r\ninteresting question, in my view. He says, “How come \r\nMalaysia” — referring to an overwhelmingly Muslim \r\ncountry — “does not have similar problems?” Then he \r\nanswers: “Because Malaysia is not trying to change the \r\ninternational order”. That is our moderate.\r\nLet us not be fooled by Iran’s manipulative charm \r\noffensive. It is designed for one purpose and one purpose \r\nonly — to have the sanctions lifted and the obstacles to \r\nIran’s path to the bomb removed. The Islamic Republic \r\nis now trying to bamboozle its way to an agreement \r\n34/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nthat will remove the sanctions it still faces and leave it \r\nwith the capacity of thousands of centrifuges to enrich \r\nuranium. That would effectively cement Iran’s place as \r\na threshold military nuclear Power. In the future, at the \r\ntime of its choosing, Iran, the world’s most dangerous \r\nregime, in the world’s most dangerous region, would \r\nobtain the world’s most dangerous weapons. Allowing \r\nthat to happen would pose the gravest threat to us all.\r\nIt is one thing to confront militant Islamists on \r\npickup trucks armed with Kalashnikov rif les. It is \r\nanother thing to confront militant Islamists armed with \r\nweapons of mass destruction. I remember that last year \r\neveryone here was rightly concerned about the chemical \r\nweapons in Syria, including the possibility that they \r\nwould fall into the hands of terrorists. Well, that did \r\nnot happen, and President Obama deserves great \r\ncredit for leading the diplomatic effort to dismantle \r\nvirtually all of Syria’s chemical weapons capability. \r\nWe can only imagine how much more dangerous \r\nthe Islamic State — ISIS — would be if it possessed \r\nchemical weapons. Now, let us imagine how much \r\nmore dangerous the Islamic State of Iran would be if it \r\npossessed nuclear weapons.\r\nWould you let ISIS enrich uranium? Would you let \r\nISIS build a heavy-water reactor? Would you let ISIS \r\ndevelop intercontinental ballistic missiles? Of course \r\nyou would not. Then you must not let the Islamic \r\nState of Iran do those things either, because if you do, \r\nhere is what will happen. Once Iran produces atomic \r\nbombs, all the charm and all the smiles will suddenly \r\ndisappear — they will just vanish. It is then that the \r\nayatollahs will show their true face and unleash their \r\naggressive fanaticism on the entire world.\r\nThere is only one responsible course of action to \r\naddress this threat. Iran’s nuclear military capabilities \r\nmust be fully dismantled. Make no mistake — ISIS \r\nmust be defeated, but to defeat ISIS and leave Iran as \r\na threshold nuclear Power is to win the battle and lose \r\nthe war.\r\nThe fight against militant Islam is indivisible. When \r\nmilitant Islam succeeds anywhere, it is emboldened \r\neverywhere. When it suffers a blow in one place, it is set \r\nback in every place. That is why Israel’s fight against \r\nHamas is not just our fight; it is everyone’s fight. Israel is \r\nfighting a fanaticism today that other countries may be \r\nforced to fight tomorrow. For 50 days this past summer, \r\nHamas fired thousands of rockets at Israel, many of \r\nthem supplied by Iran. I want members to think about \r\nwhat their countries would do if thousands of rockets \r\nwere fired at their cities. Let them imagine millions \r\nof their citizens having seconds at most to scramble to \r\nbomb shelters, day after day. Members would not let \r\nterrorists fire rockets at their cities with impunity, nor \r\nwould they let terrorists dig dozens of terror tunnels \r\nunder their borders to infiltrate their towns in order to \r\nmurder and kidnap their citizens. Israel justly defended \r\nitself against both rocket attacks and terror tunnels.\r\nYet Israel faced another challenge. We faced a \r\npropaganda war because, in an attempt to win the world’s \r\nsympathy, Hamas cynically used Palestinian civilians \r\nas human shields. It used schools — not just schools, \r\nUnited Nations schools — private homes, mosques \r\nand even hospitals to store and fire rockets at Israel. \r\nAs Israel surgically struck at the rocket launchers and \r\nat the tunnels, Palestinian civilians were tragically but \r\nunintentionally killed. There are heartrending images \r\nthat resulted, and these fuelled libellous charges that \r\nIsrael was deliberately targeting civilians. We were not. \r\nWe deeply regret every single civilian casualty.\r\nAnd the truth is, Israel was doing everything to \r\nminimize Palestinian civilian casualties. Hamas was \r\ndoing everything to maximize Israeli civilian casualties \r\nand Palestinian civilian casualties. Israel dropped \r\nf lyers, made phone calls, sent text messages, broadcast \r\nwarnings in Arabic on Palestinian television — all \r\nthis to enable Palestinian civilians to evaluate targeted \r\nareas. No other country and no other army in history \r\nhave gone to greater lengths to avoid casualties among \r\nthe civilian population of their enemies.\r\nSuch concern for Palestinian life was all the more \r\nremarkable given that Israeli civilians were being \r\nbombarded by rockets, day after day, night after \r\nnight. And as their families were being rocketed by \r\nHamas, Israel’s citizen army, the brave soldiers of \r\nthe Israel Defense Forces, our young boys and girls, \r\nupheld the highest moral values of any army in the \r\nworld. Israel’s soldiers deserve not condemnation \r\nbut admiration — admiration from decent people \r\neverywhere.\r\nHere is what Hamas did. Hamas embedded \r\nits missile batteries in residential areas and told \r\nPalestinians to ignore Israel’s warnings to leave. \r\nAnd just in case people did not get the message, they \r\nexecuted Palestinian civilians in Gaza who dared to \r\nprotest. And, no less reprehensible, Hamas deliberately \r\n14-55181 35/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nplaced its rockets where Palestinian children live and \r\nplay.\r\nLet me show the Assembly a photograph. It was \r\ntaken by a France 24 crew during the recent conflict. \r\nIt shows two Hamas rocket launchers, which were used \r\nto attack us. Three children can be seen playing next to \r\nthem. Hamas deliberately put its rockets in hundreds \r\nof residential areas like this — hundreds of them. That \r\nis a war crime. I say to President Abbas, these are the \r\ncrimes — the war crimes — committed by his Hamas \r\npartners in the national unity Government which he \r\nheads and for which he is responsible. These are the \r\nreal war crimes he should have investigated or spoken \r\nout against from this rostrum last week.\r\nAs Israel’s children huddle in bomb shelters and \r\nIsrael’s Iron Dome missile defence knocked Hamas \r\nrockets out of the sky, the profound moral difference \r\nbetween Israel and Hamas could not have been clearer. \r\nIsrael was using its missiles to protect its children; \r\nHamas was using its children to protect its missiles.\r\nBy investigating Israel rather than Hamas for war \r\ncrimes, the United Nations Human Rights Council has \r\nbetrayed its noble mission to protect the innocent. In \r\nfact, what it is doing is to turn the laws of war upside \r\ndown. Israel, which took unprecedented steps to \r\nminimize civilian casualties, is condemned; Hamas, \r\nwhich both targeted and hid behind civilians — that is a \r\ndouble war crime — is given a pass. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil is thus sending a clear message to terrorists \r\neverywhere: “Use civilians as a human shield. Use \r\nthem again and again and again.” And you know why? \r\nBecause, sadly, it works. By granting international \r\nlegitimacy to the use of human shields, the Human \r\nRights Council has become a terrorist rights council, \r\nand it will have repercussions — it probably already \r\nhas — in terms of the use of civilians as human shields. \r\nIt is not just our interests and values that are under \r\nattack: it is the interests and values of all of us.\r\nWe live in a world steeped in tyranny and terror, \r\nwhere gays are hanged from cranes in Tehran, political \r\nprisoners are executed in Gaza, young girls are abducted \r\nen masse in Nigeria and hundreds of thousands are \r\nbutchered in Syria, Libya and Iraq, yet nearly half of \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s resolutions focusing on a \r\nsingle country have been directed against Israel — the \r\none true democracy in the Middle East; Israel, where \r\nissues are openly debated in a boisterous Parliament, \r\nwhere human rights are protected by independent \r\ncourts, and where women, gays and minorities live in a \r\ngenuinely free society.\r\nThe biased treatment of Israel by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil — that is a misnomer, but I will use it just the \r\nsame — is only one manifestation of the return of one \r\nof the world’s oldest prejudices. We hear mobs today in \r\nEurope calling for the gassing of Jews. We hear some \r\nnational leaders compare Israel to the Nazis. This is \r\nnot a function of Israel’s policies; it is a function of \r\ndiseased minds, and that disease has a name. It is called \r\nanti-Semitism. It is now spreading in polite society \r\nwhere it masquerades as legitimate criticism of Israel. \r\nFor centuries, the Jewish people have been demonized \r\nwith blood libels and charges of deicide. Today, the \r\nJewish State is demonized with the apartheid libel and \r\ncharges of genocide.\r\nIn what moral universe does genocide include \r\nwarning the enemy civilian population to get out \r\nof harm’s way or ensuring that they receive tons of \r\nhumanitarian aid each day, even as thousands of rockets \r\nare being fired at us, or setting up a field hospital \r\nto aid their wounded? I suppose it is the same moral \r\nuniverse in which a man who wrote a dissertation of \r\nlies about the Holocaust and who insists on a Palestine \r\nfree of Jews — Judenrein — can stand at this rostrum \r\nand shamelessly accuse Israel of genocide and ethnic \r\ncleansing. In the past, outrageous lies against the Jews \r\nwere the precursors to the wholesale slaughter of our \r\npeople. But no more; today, we the Jewish people have \r\nthe power to defend ourselves. We will defend ourselves \r\nagainst our enemies on the battlefield and we will expose \r\ntheir lies against us in the court of public opinion. Israel \r\nwill continue to stand proud and unbowed.\r\nDespite the enormous challenges facing Israel, I \r\nbelieve we have a historic opportunity. After decades of \r\nseeing Israel as their enemy, leading States in the Arab \r\nworld increasingly recognize that together we and they \r\nface many of the same dangers. Principally, that means \r\na nuclear-armed Iran and militant Islamist movements \r\ngaining ground in the Sunni world. Our challenge is to \r\ntransform those common interests in order to create a \r\nproductive partnership that would build a more secure, \r\npeaceful and prosperous Middle East. Together we can \r\nstrengthen regional security. We can advance projects \r\nin water, agriculture, transportation, health care, energy \r\nand so many other fields.\r\nI believe that the partnership between us can also \r\nhelp facilitate peace between Israel and the Palestinians. \r\n36/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nMany have long assumed that an Israeli-Palestinian \r\npeace can help facilitate a broader rapprochement \r\nbetween Israel and the Arab world. But I believe that, \r\nthese days, it may work the other way around, namely, \r\nthat a broader rapprochement between Israel and the \r\nArab world may help facilitate an Israeli-Palestinian \r\npeace. Therefore, to achieve that peace, we must look \r\nnot only to Jerusalem and Ramallah but also to Cairo, \r\nAmman, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and elsewhere. I believe \r\nthat peace could be realized with the active involvement \r\nof Arab countries that are willing to provide political, \r\nmaterial and other indispensable support.\r\nI am ready to make a historic compromise, and not \r\nbecause Israel occupies a foreign land. The people of \r\nIsrael are not occupiers in the land of Israel. History, \r\narchaeology and common sense all make clear that we \r\nhave had a singular attachment to this land for over \r\n3,000 years. I want peace because I want to create a \r\nbetter future for my people. But it must be a genuine \r\npeace, one that is anchored in mutual recognition and \r\nenduring security arrangements — rock-solid security \r\narrangements — on the ground. Israel’s withdrawal \r\nfrom Lebanon and Gaza created two militant Islamic \r\nenclaves on our borders from which tens of thousands \r\nof rockets have been fired at Israel. Those sobering \r\nexperiences heighten Israel’s security concerns \r\nregarding potential territorial concessions in the future.\r\nThose security concerns are even greater today. Let \r\nus just look around. The Middle East is in chaos. States \r\nare disintegrating, and militant Islamists are filling \r\nthe void. Israel cannot have territories from which it \r\nwithdraws taken over by Islamic militants yet again, \r\nas happened in Gaza and Lebanon. That would place \r\nthe likes of ISIS within mortar range, a few miles of \r\n80 per cent of our population. Think about that. The \r\ndistance between the 1967 lines and the suburbs of \r\nTel Aviv is similar to the distance between United \r\nNations Headquarters and Times Square. Israel is a tiny \r\ncountry. That is why in any peace agreement, which \r\nwill obviously necessitate a territorial compromise, I \r\nwill always insist that Israel be able to defend itself, by \r\nitself, against any threat.\r\nYet despite everything that has happened, some still \r\ndo not take Israel’s security concerns seriously, but I do \r\nand I always will. That is because as Prime Minister of \r\nIsrael I am entrusted with the awesome responsibility \r\nof ensuring the future of the Jewish people and the \r\nfuture of the Jewish State. No matter what pressure is \r\nbrought to bear, I will never waver in fulfilling that \r\nresponsibility.\r\nI believe that with a fresh approach on the part \r\nof our neighbours, we can advance peace despite the \r\ndifficulties we face. In Israel, we have a record of making \r\nthe impossible possible. We have made a desolate land \r\nf lourish, and with very few natural resources we have \r\nused the fertile minds of our people to turn Israel into \r\na global centre of technology and innovation. Peace \r\nwould enable Israel to realize its full potential and to \r\nbring a promising future not only to our people and not \r\nonly to the Palestinian people, but to many, many others \r\nin our region. But the old template for peace must be \r\nupdated. It must take into account new realities and \r\nnew roles and responsibilities for our Arab neighbours.\r\nThere is a new Middle East. It presents new dangers \r\nbut also new opportunities. Israel is prepared to work \r\nwith Arab partners and the international community to \r\nconfront those dangers and to seize those opportunities. \r\nTogether, we must recognize the global threat of \r\nmilitant Islam, the primacy of dismantling Iran’s \r\nnuclear weapons capability, and the indispensable role \r\nof Arab States in advancing peace with the Palestinians. \r\nAll that may f ly in the face of conventional wisdom, but \r\nit is the truth. And the truth must always be spoken, \r\nespecially in the United Nations. Isaiah, a great prophet \r\nof peace, taught us nearly 3,000 years ago in Jerusalem \r\nto speak truth to power. He said:\r\n“For the sake of Zion, I will not be silent. For the \r\nsake of Jerusalem, I will not be still until her justice \r\nshines bright and her salvation glows like a f laming \r\ntorch”.\r\nLet us light a torch of truth and justice to safeguard \r\nour common future.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister and Minister of \r\nPublic Affairs and the Diaspora of the State of Israel \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Public Affairs and the Diaspora of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nMr. Sveinsson (Iceland): Next year we will \r\ncelebrate the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\n14-55181 37/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nNations. As we approach that milestone, it is good \r\nto reflect on the successes of our Organization: the \r\nextensive codification of international law, advances \r\nin combating poverty and disease, and fighting \r\nhuman rights abuses. We have established monitoring \r\nmechanisms, such as the human rights treaty bodies, \r\nand accountability tools, such as the International \r\nCriminal Court, and agreed on historic policy targets \r\nthat have transformed international cooperation, such \r\nas the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThese are not small achievements, but sitting on \r\nour laurels is not an option. The system of rule-bound \r\nrelations between nations is under threat, and we must \r\nprotect it. Most worrying is the growing disregard for \r\ninternational law. This erodes the international legal \r\nframework we have developed since the Second World \r\nWar. A shocking recent example is the terrorist group \r\noperating in Iraq and Syria, the self-styled Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant. As human beings, we are \r\nrevolted by its brutality and appalled by its mindless \r\ndestruction.\r\nThe international community cannot accept the \r\ndisregard for the fundamental principles of the United \r\nNations — indeed, of human decency — shown by this \r\ngroup. Iceland therefore agrees with the lawful actions \r\ntaken to end these atrocities by countries of the region \r\nand from other parts of the world. Iceland will contribute \r\nhumanitarian aid through the United Nations agencies. \r\nNo civilized nation can look the other way when the \r\nbarbarism and cruelty are so overwhelming. The United \r\nNations and international law must be centre stage, \r\nand we underscore the role of the Security Council in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nThe suffering of the Syrian people and the total \r\ndisrespect for humanitarian law in that civil war are \r\nequally shocking. Almost 200,000 people have died, \r\n3 million refugees are abroad, and the country is in \r\nruins. The prolonged foreign occupation of the State \r\nof Palestine is another violation of international law. \r\nLand-grabbing continues unabated. The blockade \r\nof Gaza shows no signs of being lifted. Violations of \r\nhuman rights continue, including against freedom of \r\nmovement, the right to freedom of speech and assembly \r\nand property rights.\r\nThis summer, a pointless war between Israel and \r\nGaza caused an unacceptable loss of life. I condemn \r\nthe indiscriminate rocket attacks of Hamas and other \r\nmilitant organizations in Gaza against civilian targets \r\nin Israel. I also condemn the disproportionate use of \r\nforce by the Israel Defense Forces, which resulted in \r\nmore than 2,000 deaths in Gaza. Let the loss of life \r\nnot have been in vain and let the future of Palestinian \r\nchildren be a future without foreign occupation. A \r\ntwo-State solution, with the comprehensive support \r\nof neighbouring countries and robust international \r\npeacekeeping arrangements, should be the objective. \r\nTo the Palestinians I say, “Reconcile. Be your own \r\nbest friends so you can build a free and sovereign \r\nPalestine ensuring fundamental rights and freedom \r\nfor all”. To the Israelis, I say, “The current situation \r\nis unsustainable. Be brave, be wise and give peace a \r\nchance. The occupation of Palestine must end.”\r\nThe violation of Ukraine’s territorial integrity \r\nbreaches the Charter of the United Nations, international \r\nlaw and numerous treaties. The illegal annexation of \r\nCrimea threatens security and stability throughout \r\nEurope. The credibility of the Security Council is \r\nseriously undermined when a permanent member \r\nviolates the Charter by using force to change borders, \r\nand then can veto the necessary response and actions \r\nby the body empowered to maintain international peace \r\nand security. The Council is also undermined when it \r\nproves incapable of defending civilians who are subject \r\nto foreign occupation or is unable to prevent the use of \r\nchemical weapons.\r\nThe United Nations was founded to ensure that \r\nthe fate of nations would never again be decided at the \r\nbarrel of a gun. Recent events have shown that we must \r\nreaffirm our commitment to the Charter of the United \r\nNations and other legal instruments to safeguard the \r\nfoundations of a just and peaceful world. This holds \r\nparticularly true for the Security Council. In its role \r\nof maintaining international peace and security, \r\nits compass should be the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law, including international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights law. It should apply \r\nthe law equally to all parties. The Council needs to \r\nbecome more solution-oriented and directly engaged. \r\nIts working methods must improve, especially the \r\napplication of the veto. Iceland supports the recent \r\nFrench- and Mexican-led proposal for framing the veto \r\nin cases of mass atrocities. The Council should also \r\nmake use of its referral power as intended by the Rome \r\nStatute.\r\n38/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nIn a world riven by inequality, poverty and onflict, \r\nit is a challenge to chart a path towards the future we \r\nwant. Since the most recent general debate, we have \r\nmade real progress in preparing for the decisions to \r\nbe taken next year on a new framework for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The year ahead will be a test of our resolve \r\nto deliver. Iceland will participate constructively in the \r\nnegotiations for the post-2015 agenda, as well as for a \r\nnew regime to address climate change.\r\nAllow me to highlight a few issues that I believe to \r\nbe fundamental. With an increasing world population, \r\nmeasures to ensure food security are more important \r\nthan ever. For 3 billion people, seafood provides about \r\n20 per cent of their intake of animal protein. Nine to 12 \r\nper cent of the global population depends on the seafood \r\nsector for their livelihood. Yet we have a paradox. \r\nOverfishing remains a widespread problem, but at \r\nthe same time fisheries are greatly underperforming. \r\nWith improved infrastructure and better management, \r\nthe economic benefits from marine fisheries could be \r\nincreased by $50 billion per year, or more than half the \r\nvalue of the global seafood trade.\r\nIt is clear that ocean issues are one of the keys \r\nto the post-2015 development agenda. The United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides \r\na sound legal basis on which States can harness their \r\nmarine resources. Iceland remains firmly loyal to \r\nthe Convention, and we build our marine policy on \r\nscientific research where sustainability guides all our \r\ndecisions. The Convention on the Law of the Sea has \r\nbeen instrumental to Iceland’s success, yet what is often \r\nlacking is the capacity of States to implement effective \r\nmonitoring and sustainable harvesting. Iceland has \r\nbeen sharing know-how through the United Nations \r\nUniversity Fisheries Training Programme in Iceland, \r\nwhere over 1,500 experts have benefited from post-\r\ngraduate studies and workshops in the field.\r\nThe second key area for ensuring food security is \r\nland. Every decade, 120 million hectares of land — an \r\narea the size of South Africa — are lost to desertification \r\nand drought. Climate change is contributing to an ever-\r\nfaster rate of land degradation, which in turn releases \r\ngreenhouse gases, creating a vicious circle. Switching \r\nto sustainable land management is therefore not only \r\ncrucial to food and water security, but an important \r\nfactor in mitigating and adapting to climate change. This \r\nis why Iceland argues strongly for measures to achieve \r\na land-degradation neutral world. Iceland contributes \r\nactively to these efforts through the Group of Friends \r\nof the Secretary-General in New York and through the \r\nUnited Nations University Land Restoration Training \r\nProgramme in Iceland.\r\nA third key area is to ensure access to affordable, \r\nreliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. No \r\nsociety can develop without energy, yet today over \r\n1.3 billion people have no access to electricity. As \r\nenergy production grows, it is essential to substantially \r\nincrease the share of renewable energy in the global \r\nenergy supply by 2030. Iceland is contributing to that \r\neffort. We have partnered with a group of countries and \r\nthe International Renewable Energy Agency to identify \r\nopportunities and to support mechanisms to scale up \r\ngeothermal production. In that connection, we invite \r\nMember States to join the Global Geothermal Alliance. \r\nIceland has also been working with the World Bank on \r\nprojects in the Great African Rift Valley, and we have \r\nrun the Geothermal Training Programme of the United \r\nNations University in Iceland for 35 years.\r\nIn Iceland and the other Nordic countries, the \r\nrevolution in women’s education and the high level of \r\nfemale participation in the labour market have been \r\nthe basis of our welfare and economic prosperity. \r\nWithout the full and equal participation of women in \r\nall spheres of society, including in decision-making, it \r\nwill be impossible to make real and lasting progress \r\nin addressing sustainable development challenges. \r\nThe stand-alone goal on gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment agreed in the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals must be maintained. \r\nBut we should not stop there. Gender equality must be \r\nfurther mainstreamed throughout the new framework. \r\nIn that regard, I cannot leave out the centrality of \r\nensuring sexual and reproductive health and rights.\r\nWe must continue to fight for the full \r\nimplementation of the commitments we made almost \r\n20 years ago in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for \r\nAction. Iceland is proud to support UN-Women in the \r\ncampaign to celebrate Beijing+20. We have partnered \r\nwith Suriname to lead a friends’ group of countries \r\nto galvanize support to promote gender equality and \r\nto commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nDeclaration. We call on Member States to join that \r\neffort and take concrete actions on the 12 themes of the \r\nPlatform for Action.\r\nFor our part, we want to bring men and boys to the \r\ntable on gender equality in a positive way. Iceland and \r\nSuriname will convene a “barbershop” conference in \r\n14-55181 39/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nJanuary 2015, where men will discuss gender equality \r\nwith other men, with a special focus on addressing \r\nviolence against women. That will be a unique \r\nconference, as it will be the first time at the United \r\nNations that we bring together only male leaders to \r\ndiscuss gender equality. It will provide an exceptional \r\ncontribution to the Beijing+20 conference and the \r\nHeForShe campaigns.\r\nWe have been reminded in recent weeks of the \r\nfragility of human beings and the need for us to work \r\ntogether on the biggest threats to humankind. Let me \r\nexpress our sympathy for and solidarity with the States \r\nsuffering from the Ebola outbreak. The Government of \r\nIceland will join in the international effort to curb the \r\noutbreak with financial contributions to United Nations \r\nagencies.\r\nNext year, the States Members of the United Nations \r\nwill come together to make important decisions on \r\nhow to address climate change and pursue sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In the North, Arctic biodiversity and \r\necosystems are threatened by climate change, and \r\nsustainable harvesting of natural resources is vital. I \r\npledge Iceland’s commitment to work for bold decisions \r\non the future of our planet and the increased prosperity \r\nof the world community in the year 2015. May the wise \r\nwords of Nelson Mandela come true as we navigate that \r\npath: “It always seems impossible until it’s done.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Phandu Skelemani, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nInternational Cooperation of the Republic of Botswana.\r\nMr. Skelemani (Botswana): It is a singular honour \r\nand privilege for me to address this gathering of the \r\ninternational community. Allow me, on behalf of His \r\nExcellency the President of the Republic of Botswana, \r\nLieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, to \r\njoin other delegations in extending our warmest \r\ncongratulations to the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. We are confident that his vast experience and \r\ndedicated service to the Government and people of \r\nUganda will contribute significantly to the successful \r\nconclusion of this session. My delegation and I wish him \r\nevery success as he embarks on this new responsibility \r\nof steering the work of the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We also extend fitting tribute to his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Ambassador John Ashe, \r\nfor his sterling leadership of the sixty-eighth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We commend him for his tireless \r\nefforts to overcome many of the challenges confronting \r\nthe international community today.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the theme that the President \r\nhas chosen for the current general debate, namely, \r\n“Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda”. We consider it both \r\npertinent and timely, especially as it coincides with \r\nongoing efforts by Member States to formulate a new \r\nglobal development agenda to succeed the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). We shall tirelessly work \r\nwith the President and the international community \r\nas we define the post-2015 development agenda. The \r\npriorities that the President has laid out for this session \r\nof the Assembly, that is, the issues of climate change, \r\npoverty eradication, the empowerment of women and \r\ngender equality, the rule of law and international peace \r\nand security, are among the most critical and central to \r\nthe success and sustainability of a global development \r\nagenda.\r\nAs we draw the curtain on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, it is important that we reflect on \r\nour successes and failures in order to draw vital lessons \r\nfrom our experience. The global community, most \r\nnotably in the developing world, has faced significant \r\nchallenges in fully realizing the MDGs. That has \r\nresulted in many of our countries failing to deliver \r\ntangible development achievements to their citizens, as \r\ncogently set out in the MDGs, despite their best efforts \r\nand intentions. We continue to witness intolerable \r\nlevels of poverty, disease, economic stagnation and \r\nenvironmental degradation, as well as other drawbacks, \r\nprecipitated in large part by natural disasters and severe \r\nresource and capacity constraints.\r\nWhile Botswana has made impressive gains in the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs, it has not been without \r\nenormous challenges, chief among which were resource \r\nand capacity constraints. The Botswana Government has \r\nstrived to achieve the MDGs and improve the quality of \r\nlife of its citizens by allocating a substantial percentage \r\nof the national budget to the sectors with significant \r\nbearing on the country’s development, including \r\neducation, health, infrastructure, the development of \r\nhuman capital, and women and youth empowerment. \r\nBotswana continues to make every effort, in the \r\nremaining time before the target 2015 completion date, \r\nto finish the unfinished business remaining from the \r\nMDGs, especially Goals 4 and 5, relating to infant and \r\nmaternal mortality.\r\n40/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nThe outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus disease, \r\nevolving, as it did, into a public health catastrophe, is \r\na serious setback to the achievement of the MDGs. We \r\ntherefore implore the Assembly to call on all partners \r\nand organizations of goodwill to spare no effort in \r\nrescuing the West African region from that scourge.\r\nThe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of 2012 mapped a clear and strategic path \r\nfor the achievement of global sustainable development, \r\ncalling for an inclusive and transformative agenda that \r\nintegrates the three pillars of sustainable development, \r\nnamely, economic, social and environmental protection.\r\nBotswana has keenly followed the work of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, which has had as its primary objective the \r\nformulation of a single, transformative and global \r\ndevelopment agenda, as mandated by the Rio+20 \r\noutcome document. We are highly encouraged by \r\nthe spirit of consultation and the collective will and \r\ncommitment of the international community to craft an \r\nambitious yet inclusive, measurable and sustainable set \r\nof goals, which should inspire and challenge us all to \r\nexcel in our quest for the attainment of the future we \r\nwant. I commend the co-Chairs of the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals for their \r\nexceptional performance in driving the negotiation \r\nprocess to its logical conclusion. We look forward to \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the broader post-\r\n2015 development framework, which will begin during \r\nthis session of the General Assembly. I assure the \r\nAssembly of our fullest cooperation and constructive \r\nengagement in those deliberations.\r\nMy delegation will actively participate in all \r\ndeliberations on the key development priorities outlined \r\nby the Secretary-General, in particular the elaboration \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda. However, there \r\nare issues of major strategic importance to Botswana. \r\nThey include climate change, landlocked developing \r\ncountries, middle-income countries, countries in \r\nspecial situations and issues of peace and security and \r\nthe advancement of human rights.\r\nOn climate change, Botswana knows only too well \r\nthe devastating effects of that phenomenon, which \r\ncontinues to cause extreme temperatures, changes in the \r\npatterns of rainfall, land degradation, desertification \r\nand persistent droughts. In that regard, we believe \r\nthat addressing those problems should be a primary \r\nconsideration in the current deliberations on the post-\r\n2015 sustainable development agenda. We therefore \r\nlook forward to the twentieth Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, to be held in Lima this year, which \r\nis supposed to lay the foundation for a legally binding \r\nagreement for adoption at the next Conference of the \r\nParties in Paris. We commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor his initiative in convening the recently concluded \r\nClimate Change Summit, which successfully injected \r\nmuch-needed political momentum into the process as \r\nwe move towards 2015.\r\nAs a middle-income, landlocked developing \r\ncountry with particular vulnerabilities, we also strongly \r\nhope for a comprehensive account of those issues in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. We welcome the \r\n10-year review of the Almaty Programme of Action, \r\nto be held in November in Vienna, which will broadly \r\nconsider effective mechanisms for addressing the \r\nvulnerabilities of landlocked developing countries. We \r\nhope that, during the review, special attention will also \r\nbe given to countries with ever-increasing elephant \r\npopulations, whose numbers not only give rise to \r\nserious animal-human conflict, but also devastate the \r\nvery environment that the elephants depend on for their \r\nsurvival. Botswana has the largest elephant population \r\nin Africa.\r\nOn issues of social development, I am delighted to \r\ninform the Assembly that Botswana is making steady \r\nprogress in eradicating abject poverty, as a result of \r\nthe implementation of the national poverty eradication \r\nstrategy that was launched in 2010. Furthermore, we \r\nhave been able to achieve universal primary education \r\nand access to HIV/AIDS treatment, care and support \r\nservices. However, challenges remain on the issues of \r\nmaintaining quality in education and general services.\r\nFinancial support, technology transfer and \r\ncapacity-building must invariably be factored into the \r\npost-2015 development agenda discussions. Failing \r\nthat, our efforts towards poverty eradication and \r\nsustainable development will be rendered futile. We \r\nkeenly await the adoption of the new development \r\nagenda, which will, we trust, support our individual \r\nand collective efforts to deliver our shared aspirations \r\nof a safe, secure and prosperous world for both present \r\nand future generations.\r\nThreats to international peace and security \r\ncontinue to be among the greatest challenges to human \r\ndevelopment. Botswana is gravely concerned about the \r\n14-55181 41/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nincreasing trend of instability, insecurity and violent \r\nconflict in various parts of the world. We are currently \r\nwitnessing unimaginable levels of human suffering, \r\nwith thousands of innocent lives being lost and the \r\nworld hurtling precipitously towards calamitous levels \r\nof humanitarian crises.\r\nThe Palestine/Israel conflict and the protracted \r\nbrutal war in Syria defy human imagination. In Africa, \r\nthe frequent eruption of violent conflicts in certain \r\nparts of our continent, now particularly in South Sudan \r\nand the Central African Republic, are distressing. \r\nRegrettably, Iraq is also under siege by the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant and the Nusra Front. \r\nThose terrorist groups threaten not only the stability \r\nand security of the Middle East, but the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security at large.\r\nNot only are we failing as nation States to exercise \r\nour duty and responsibility to protect populations from \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity, we in effect \r\ninadvertently acquiesce in the annihilation of future \r\ngenerations. Last June, Botswana and the Netherlands \r\nco-hosted the fourth meeting of the Global Network \r\nof Focal Points on the Responsibility to Protect, in an \r\neffort to further consolidate that fundamental principle, \r\nwhich promotes our individual and collective sense of \r\nresponsibility towards our citizens.\r\nWhile such efforts may be effective in terms of \r\nawareness-raising, swift and decisive action remains the \r\ndomain of the Security Council. It is therefore incumbent \r\nupon members of the Security Council to demonstrate \r\nexemplary leadership and a genuine regard for their \r\nCharter responsibilities to maintain international peace \r\nand security, as mandated by Article 24 of the Charter. \r\nBotswana is deeply disappointed and concerned that \r\nsome permanent members of the Security Council \r\nconsistently thwart any efforts to find lasting solutions \r\nto conflict situations. Surely, responsible members of \r\nthe international community would not, and should \r\nnot, abdicate their solemn responsibility and allow \r\nthe Council to be seemingly impelled into a state of \r\ngrim paralysis as the world burns towards extinction. \r\nJust this past May, the Council failed to adopt a draft \r\nresolution seeking to refer the situation in Syria to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). Needless to say, \r\nthat was nothing short of a travesty of international \r\ncriminal justice.\r\nBotswana’s commitment to an effective international \r\ncriminal justice system remains steadfast. To that \r\nend, we continue to support the independence and \r\ncredibility of the ICC as the only existing international \r\njudicial mechanism available for the investigation and \r\nprosecution of genocide, war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and the crime of aggression. However, the \r\nrole of the Security Council in facilitating the work of \r\nthe ICC cannot be over-emphasized. It is our sincere \r\nhope that, going forward, reason and basic human \r\ncompassion will prevail in Council decisions aimed \r\nat eliminating threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity and at fostering a global culture of judicial \r\naccountability, inclusive governance, the rule of law \r\nand respect for human rights. In that regard, Botswana \r\nwelcomes the French initiative regarding voluntary \r\nrestraint on the use of the veto by the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council in situations of mass \r\natrocities.\r\nBotswana also commends those countries, human \r\nrights defenders and humanitarian organizations that \r\nhave valiantly contributed to efforts to relieve human \r\nsuffering wherever it occurred around the world. We \r\nespecially applaud Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his unwavering commitment to the pursuit of \r\ninternational peace and security, including addressing \r\nthe plight of vulnerable groups in society, such as \r\nwomen and children.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating and reaffirming \r\nBotswana’s commitment to the principles and ideals \r\nof the United Nations as enshrined in the Charter. We \r\nremain steadfast and resolute in our obligation as a \r\nmember of the international community to contribute, \r\nin our own small way, to the creation of a peaceful, \r\nsecure and prosperous world for all.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wunna Maung Lwin, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Wunna Maung Lwin (Myanmar): We are \r\ngathered here at a time when the world is facing \r\npressing global challenges and security threats that \r\nmust be addressed collectively and with urgency. Our \r\nplanet is heating up owing to the clear and imminent \r\ndanger of climate change. Terrorism is rearing its ugly \r\nhead once again. The global village is gripped with fear \r\nof the spreading Ebola epidemic. Tension and mistrust \r\nare building up among the major Powers, reminiscent \r\nof the rivalry of the Cold War. The number and scale \r\nof regional and local conflicts is growing in some parts \r\n42/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nof the world. One billion people are still trapped in \r\npoverty. The world we want is still a distant dream.\r\nClimate change is no longer merely an issue for \r\nscientific argument; it is one of survival that requires our \r\nurgent action. Many developing countries economically \r\ndependent on agriculture, as well as small island States, \r\nwill bear the brunt of its impact. It is of the utmost \r\nimportance that we agree a new global commitment \r\non climate protection and emissions-reduction \r\nobjectives. My delegation is therefore thankful to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for organizing the \r\nClimate Summit 2014, whose message that urgent and \r\nunited action is needed was loud and clear. Myanmar \r\nwill continue to work together with the international \r\ncommunity towards a meaningful, implementable and \r\nuniversal climate agreement in Paris in 2015.\r\nIn support of the vision of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, we must intensify our efforts at \r\nthis session to set the world on the path to sustainable \r\ndevelopment in its economic, social and environmental \r\ndimensions. In that process, we must also work together \r\nto find effective means for implementation, including \r\nthe mobilization of financial and technological support, \r\nin order to ensure the success of the new agenda and the \r\nsustainable development goals.\r\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa, with its \r\nunprecedented nature and scope, is alarming. We must \r\nnot see that outbreak as unique to one particular people \r\nor place. It is a common challenge to all of humankind. \r\nMyanmar welcomes the swift and timely response by \r\nthe Secretary-General in proactively establishing the \r\nUnited Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response.\r\nTerrorism cannot be condoned for any reason \r\nor under any circumstances. Ruthless killings and \r\natrocities in the name of religion must not be tolerated. \r\nMyanmar has always opposed terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. We are not oblivious to the fate \r\nof those who have fallen victims to terrorism. The \r\ninternational community must be united to eliminate \r\nthose horrible crimes. In that regard, my delegation \r\nfully supports the statement issued by the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Foreign Ministers \r\na few days ago here in New York.\r\nMyanmar firmly believes in the continued relevance \r\nand legitimacy of the United Nations in world affairs. \r\nWe will continue to actively cooperate with it, in line \r\nwith the principles of our foreign policy. Thanks to the \r\npositive changes in Myanmar, the cooperation between \r\nMyanmar and the United Nations is now better than \r\never. The United Nations and its agencies are showing \r\ngreater interest in Myanmar, extending a helping hand \r\nto the people of Myanmar in all aspects of their lives. \r\nThe Government, for its part, is facilitating the effective \r\nimplementation of the United Nations missions.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity is one of the main purposes of the United \r\nNations. Myanmar, as a peace-loving nation, abhors \r\nweapons of mass destruction and is fully cognizant of \r\nthe danger of nuclear weapons. To that end, Myanmar \r\nhas annually submitted, since 1995, a draft resolution \r\non nuclear disarmament. We will do so once again \r\nat the present session of the General Assembly. We \r\nencourage all Member States to positively support \r\nour draft resolution. If we follow the road map in the \r\nresolution with a strong political will, a world free of \r\nnuclear weapons will be within our grasp soon.\r\nI would like to inform the Assembly that Myanmar \r\nis making domestic preparations with a view to \r\nratifying major international disarmament instruments. \r\nConsiderable achievements have been made in that \r\nprocess. I am pleased to announce that the Pyidaungsu \r\nHluttaw, our Union Parliament, has just approved \r\nMyanmar’s accession to the Biological Weapons \r\nConvention.\r\nThe winds of change have blown across Myanmar \r\nover the past three years. The scope and pace of \r\npositive changes in Myanmar have earned remarkable \r\nrecognition and encouragement from the international \r\ncommunity. Those changes have contributed to raising \r\nMyanmar’s profile in the regional and international \r\narena. On the regional stage, Myanmar held the Chair \r\nof the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral \r\nTechnical and Economic Cooperation until March this \r\nyear. After successfully carrying out that responsibility, \r\nwe are now shouldering the prestigious responsibility of \r\nchairing ASEAN. Under our chairmanship, ASEAN is \r\nexerting its efforts to speed up the ASEAN community-\r\nbuilding process with the theme of “Moving forward in \r\nunity to a peaceful and prosperous community”.\r\nMyanmar is advancing well on the path of peaceful \r\ndemocratic transition, which began over three years \r\nago by setting in motion various waves of political \r\nand economic reforms. The first wave was the \r\npeaceful transformation from a military Government \r\nto a multiparty democratic system, where all political \r\n14-55181 43/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nforces are working together to overcome differences \r\nthrough dialogue in our two houses of Parliament. An \r\nall-inclusive political system has been established, \r\nbringing in all stakeholders in the process through \r\nnational reconciliation. The first wave of reform \r\nbrought about national reconciliation, the granting of \r\na series of amnesties, the creation of greater political \r\nspace, freedom of the media, freedom of expression, \r\nand freedom of association and peaceful assembly. It \r\nwas followed by the second wave of reform, unleashing \r\nan array of political, economic, administrative and \r\nprivate sector development reforms. Now, the third \r\nwave of reform has been launched, which aims at laying \r\ndown a firm foundation for a new democratic State and \r\ndelivering benefits to the people by fulfilling their \r\nsocioeconomic needs. We are determined to keep the \r\nreforms on track through ensuring peace, stability and \r\nnational reconciliation.\r\nSince our democracy is still in its infancy, we are \r\nfacing a multitude of daunting challenges, like other \r\ncountries in transition. The Government has a long to-\r\ndo list despite its limited capacity. We are determined to \r\novercome the challenges and we are convinced that we \r\nwill achieve our objectives. We need the international \r\ncommunity’s understanding and continued support in \r\nour efforts for economic development and capacity-\r\nbuilding to lay a solid foundation for a democratic \r\nsociety.\r\nOne of the issues that attracts domestic and \r\ninternational attention is the process of amending \r\nMyanmar’s present Constitution. In that regard, \r\nthe Pyidaungsu Hluttaw set up the Constitutional \r\nAmendment Review Joint Committee in July last \r\nyear. Further, after soliciting suggestions and \r\nrecommendations from the general public and political \r\nparties, the Constitutional Amendment Implementation \r\nCommittee was formed to address the issues of \r\nconstitutional amendment based on the suggestions \r\nreceived.\r\nPutting democratic values into practice, the \r\nGovernment is placing much more emphasis and \r\nconsideration on the aspirations of our people as a whole. \r\nAccordingly, we are laying foundations to successfully \r\nconduct an independent, free and fair election within \r\na legal framework that does not compromise national \r\nsovereignty. In that context, Myanmar recently received \r\nthe visit of a needs assessment mission from the United \r\nNations. All existing political parties are expected to \r\ntake part in the elections. The final decision will be \r\nmade by the people on election day.\r\nPeace and stability are prerequisites for political \r\nstability and for the socioeconomic development of \r\nthe country. Strengthening national reconciliation is \r\nan integral part of our reform process. We are working \r\ntogether with all ethnic armed groups in good faith to \r\nreach a nationwide ceasefire agreement. So far we have \r\nalready reached such an agreement with 14 out of the 16 \r\ngroups. We are now working on a draft framework for \r\npolitical dialogue that will pave the way for bringing an \r\nend to the six-decade long conflict.\r\nThe Government is serious in its commitment to \r\nthe success of the peace process. It is open to discussing \r\nall issues, except those that could undermine the unity \r\nand sovereignty of the State. The political dialogue will \r\nalso become a historic forum for discussion of all issues \r\nof national concern. We are confident that we are now \r\ngetting closer to achieving a comprehensive and lasting \r\npeace.\r\nThere has been steady progress in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights in my country. A \r\nseries of presidential amnesties have been granted, \r\nwhich creates an enabling environment for everyone \r\nto participate in the parliament, political parties, civil \r\nsociety organizations and labour organizations. The \r\nMyanmar National Human Rights Commission, which \r\nwas first established in 2011, was reconstituted very \r\nrecently with a view to functioning as an independent \r\nentity. Many complaint mechanisms, including the \r\nCommission, have been made available to citizens so \r\nthat they can file complaints in the event of violation \r\nof their rights.\r\nIn this new era, press and media freedom is one of \r\nthe most visible outcomes of the reforms. In contributing \r\nto the all-inclusive reform process, the media is getting \r\nmore space now. The abolishment of decades-old press \r\ncensorship, the publishing of a multitude of private \r\nnewspapers and journals and the enactment of a new \r\nmedia law are among the significant achievements in \r\nour media landscape.\r\nWith firm resolve, Myanmar is now combating \r\nhuman trafficking, preventing gender violence and \r\nprotecting children. Sexual violence is a crime strongly \r\nabhorred in our traditional values and national culture. \r\nIt is strictly forbidden by law. At the global summit \r\nin London in June this year, Myanmar joined the \r\nDeclaration of Commitment to End Sexual Violence \r\n44/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nin Conflict. Its signing of the Declaration reflects \r\nthe country’s State policy of zero tolerance for use \r\nof rape or sexual violence as a weapon of war. The \r\nArmed Forces of Myanmar are making important \r\nprogress in its implementation of the action plan to \r\nend the recruitment of child soldiers in Myanmar. Due \r\nto our strong commitment, there is no new underage \r\nrecruitment, unwittingly or otherwise.\r\nAll major human rights concerns have been \r\naddressed to a larger extent in the new Myanmar than \r\nbefore. We have now reached the middle tier of the \r\nhuman rights ladder. That progress is contributing to \r\nthe better enjoyment of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms by the people of Myanmar. Therefore, we are \r\nnow fully convinced that Myanmar should no longer \r\nremain on the agendas of the Human Rights Council \r\nand the Third Committee of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are also paying great attention to and making \r\nefforts to address the issue of the communal violence \r\nthat had occurred between the two communities in \r\nRakhine state. The history, diversity and complexity \r\nof the issue must be fully understood before jumping \r\nto conclusions. The situation should not be looked at \r\nin a superficial manner. The international community \r\nshould contribute pragmatically and objectively to \r\nfinding a durable solution. In addressing the root \r\ncause, we are working for peace, stability, harmony \r\nand development for all the people in Rakhine state. \r\nAn action plan is being finalized and will soon be \r\nlaunched. Once in place, it will be implemented in a \r\nsystematic and timely manner.\r\nI take this opportunity to thank all international \r\npartners for contributing to our efforts to address the \r\ncurrent needs of the affected people. As development \r\nis one of the main challenges in Rakhine state, I \r\nwould also like to invite the international community, \r\nparticularly the United Nations, to provide much-\r\nneeded development assistance there.\r\nThe Government of Myanmar has been focusing on \r\npoverty reduction and rural development with a view \r\nto lifting the living standards of rural and urban people \r\nalike. We are striving to realize the structural changes \r\nfrom an agriculture-based economy to an industrial \r\none. As those efforts become increasingly crystallized, \r\nwe have been enjoying steady economic growth. We \r\nhave achieved a growth rate in our gross domestic \r\nproduct of 5.6 per cent, 7.3 per cent and 8.7 per cent in \r\nthe past three years, respectively.\r\nThat encouraging trend in economic growth and \r\noverall progress in our reform process has made us take \r\nan important decision. Taking this opportunity, I would \r\nlike to announce that Myanmar is fully determined and \r\nhas initiated the internal process to graduate from its \r\nleast developed country (LDC) status. In that regard, \r\nPresident U Thein Sein has communicated to the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, our intention \r\nand determination to graduate from LDC status. A \r\nhigh-level national committee and subcommittees are \r\nactively coordinating domestic measures, including \r\na transition strategy, for our graduation. We are now \r\nworking closely with the relevant United Nations \r\nagencies for technical and necessary assistance.\r\nMyanmar has made tremendous progress over the \r\npast three and a half years, since it began wide-ranging \r\nreforms in transition to democracy. Myanmar’s success \r\nin peaceful transformation was even lauded as a model \r\nin the world today. Despite all those achievements, \r\nthere remain many challenges and hurdles on our path \r\nto democracy and development. We are fully aware of \r\nthose daunting challenges. We will not be complacent. \r\nWe are resolute and determined to continue our \r\nunrelenting efforts aimed at reform and the building of \r\na democratic State.\r\nMyanmar is changing, and changing in the right \r\ndirection. We are laying a solid foundation for a \r\ndemocratic State in which we can live in harmony, peace \r\nand prosperity. Developments in Myanmar should also \r\nbe viewed in a more balanced and objective manner. It \r\nis the primary responsibility of the people of Myanmar \r\nto realize their long-held aspirations for democracy, \r\npeace and prosperity. The continued support and \r\nunderstanding of the international community would \r\ncontribute positively to Myanmar’s reform process. \r\nRome was not built in a day.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Albert del Rosario, Secretary for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Del Rosario (Philippines): On behalf of \r\nthe Philippine Government, we offer our warmest \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Kutesa on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. I assure him of the Philippines’ steadfast \r\nsupport as he provides the leadership and inspiration \r\nin the daunting task of continuing the pursuit of a \r\ntransformative and inclusive post-2015 development \r\nagenda. In choosing the theme for his presidency, he \r\n14-55181 45/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nhas positioned people at the centre of this development \r\nagenda. This people-centred agenda is also at the core \r\nof President Benigno S. Aquino III’s Social Contract \r\nwith the Filipino People, which is underpinned by a \r\nregime of good governance.\r\nI would like to address the following issues, which \r\nare consistent with both the President’s Social Contract \r\nand the United Nations post-2015 development agenda: \r\nprogress on the Millennium Development Goals; climate \r\nchange and disaster-risk reduction and management; \r\nthe so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham; the \r\nEbola virus disease outbreak; peace, security and the \r\nrule of law; disarmament, peacekeeping, migration, \r\nthe protection of women and children; and the call for \r\nUnited Nations reforms.\r\nFourteen years ago, a shared vision of a decent and \r\nsecure life for all our peoples motivated us to adopt \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We all vowed to \r\nundertake a mission to fight poverty and disease; grant \r\nchildren of school age access to primary education; \r\nimprove gender equality, care for mothers and children; \r\nprovide our communities with safe drinking water; \r\nprotect our environment from further degradation; \r\nand mobilize international partnerships and resources \r\nto help those in great need. Today, based on the latest \r\nreport on the Millennium Development Goals, our \r\ncollective efforts have reduced by half the number of \r\npeople living in extreme poverty, provided over 2 billion \r\npeople with access to safe drinking water, and achieved \r\nsuccess in the fight against malaria and tuberculosis. \r\nBut, with one year to go, much remains to be done.\r\nThe Philippines’ scorecard shows that we have made \r\nconsiderable progress in the areas of extreme poverty \r\neradication, under age 5 mortality, the fight against \r\nboth malaria and tuberculosis, access to safe drinking \r\nwater, and gender equality. Like many other developing \r\nnations, however, we continue to face challenges in \r\nother areas. We have recently taken pause to consider \r\nnew strategies. We have also realized the importance of \r\nstrengthening good-quality data collection and analysis \r\nas a tool for measuring our Millennium Development \r\nGoals and to aid our decision-making.\r\nA year ago, before this very same Assembly, the \r\nPhilippines called for a post-2015 development agenda \r\nanchored in respect and promotion of human rights, \r\naccountable governance and inclusive development \r\n(see A/68/PV.22). All our current national efforts are \r\nfounded on these pillars.\r\nThe greatest challenge to the Philippines in \r\nmeeting the Millennium Development Goals has been \r\nthe series of disasters that have visited our country. \r\nSuper-typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon to have \r\nhit landfall in recorded history, had a significant impact \r\non the modest progress we had achieved towards the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. This and the disasters \r\nin other parts of the world remind us of the urgent need \r\nto address climate change.\r\nTwo months ago, we completed a comprehensive \r\nrehabilitation and recovery plan for the Haiyan-affected \r\nareas. The comprehensive plan requires a considerable \r\namount of resources and effort, but the Philippines \r\nand its international partners are determined to see \r\nthis massive rebuilding and rehabilitation plan to full \r\ncompletion. We are resolute in not only building back, \r\nbut building back better. Once again, let me reiterate \r\nthe Filipino people’s gratitude for the outpouring \r\nof assistance from the international community for \r\nthe victims and survivors of Haiyan. Its response \r\nand solidarity were indeed timely, overwhelming \r\nand inspiring. At this time, we look forward to the \r\nforthcoming Third World Conference on Disaster Risk \r\nReduction in Sendai, Japan, and to the first-ever World \r\nHumanitarian Summit in Istanbul, Turkey, during \r\nwhich we hope to share the lessons we have learned \r\nfrom Haiyan.\r\nJust as the international community mobilized \r\nas one in extending help to the Philippines in the \r\naftermath of Haiyan, it should also do so in the case of \r\ntwo present-day scourges: the so-called Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and the Ebola virus disease \r\noutbreak. The Philippines condemns the war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity being perpetrated by ISIS. \r\nWe support Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) on \r\nforeign terrorist fighters, adopted on 24 September, \r\nbecause we believe that resolute and immediate action \r\nis necessary to suppress that group. As a responsible \r\nmember of the international community, the Philippines \r\nwill do its part in the global efforts to thwart ISIS and \r\nits false ideologies.\r\nOn the Ebola virus disease outbreak, the Philippines \r\nrecognizes its threat to global health and its impact on \r\ndevelopment. Based on our capacity, we will support \r\nthe international community’s efforts in arresting the \r\nspread of this scourge through the auspices of the World \r\nHealth Organization.\r\n46/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nDevelopment efforts are jeopardized by setbacks \r\nbrought about by threats to peace, security and the rule \r\nof law. We must ensure that conflicts do not undermine \r\nany development agenda that we pursue. We must \r\nrededicate ourselves to the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and relevant international \r\nconventions and agreements to resolve all conflicts \r\npeacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\r\nIn this spirit, I am pleased to share the Philippine \r\nexperience in building peace in the southern \r\nPhilippines. With the signing of the Comprehensive \r\nAgreement on the Bangsamoro, we are optimistic \r\nthat peace dividends in the form of investments, jobs, \r\neconomic opportunities, access to basic services and \r\ninfrastructure will finally redound to the benefit of \r\nour Muslim brothers and sisters. We are grateful to \r\nthe United Nations and the international community \r\nfor their role in supporting us through the long and \r\nchallenging journey of this peace process.\r\nAs we herald these achievements of peace at home, \r\nhowever, we face the reality of exacerbating tensions in \r\nour regional seas. Again, the Philippines has resorted \r\nto the rule of law in trying to resolve these tensions. \r\nThe Philippines believes that the core instrument for \r\nresolving maritime disputes is the 1982 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). We have \r\ninvited a State party to settle our maritime disputes \r\npeacefully through UNCLOS, including its provisions \r\non dispute settlement, specifically arbitration under \r\nannex VII to the Convention.\r\nHowever, it has refused to join us and has continued \r\nto unilaterally embark on an expansionist claim that \r\nviolates the legitimate rights of the Philippines and \r\nother littoral neighbours under UNCLOS, such as their \r\nexclusive economic zones and continental shelves. \r\nInstead of peacefully resolving the maritime disputes \r\nwithin the framework of UNCLOS, the said State \r\nhas embarked on a series of dangerous, reckless and \r\nforceful activities in an attempt to impose unilateral \r\nchange in the maritime status quo of the South China \r\nSea. Those unilateral activities escalated the tensions \r\nand threatened peace and stability in the South China \r\nSea.\r\nIn 2012, after forcibly occupying the tiny rocks of \r\nScarborough Shoal, within 126 nautical miles of the \r\nPhilippine island of Luzon, the aforementioned State \r\nrefused to abide by a mutual agreement to de-escalate \r\ntensions by not withdrawing its vessels from the said \r\nrocks. Earlier this year, said State imposed a unilateral \r\nmoratorium on fishing in some areas of the South \r\nChina Sea that infringes on the legitimate sovereign \r\nrights of the Philippines and other coastal States to \r\ntheir exclusive economic zones. In the past two years, \r\nit has undertaken massive land reclamation activities in \r\nJohnson Reef, Mckennan Reef, Hughes Reef, Cuarteron \r\nReef and Gaven Reef in the Spratly Islands.\r\nThose unilateral activities, among others, form part \r\nof a pattern of forcing a change in the maritime status \r\nquo in order to advance a so-called nine-dash line \r\nposition, an expansive claim of indisputable sovereignty \r\nover nearly the entire South China Sea, which is in \r\ncontravention of both the 2002 China and Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Declaration on \r\nthe Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the \r\nUNCLOS. The Philippines supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for States parties to clearly define and \r\npublicize the limits of their respective maritime zones \r\nso that parties will have greater certainty concerning \r\ntheir maritime spaces.\r\nUNCLOS provides a viable mechanism for \r\nresolving conflicts, inter alia through arbitration. \r\nArbitration is an open, friendly and durable mechanism \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of maritime disputes. \r\nArbitration, in defining maritime entitlements, is \r\nintended to benefit all. Therefore, the Philippines is \r\nmore determined than ever in its pursuit of all possible \r\nmeans under international law to keep the conflict from \r\nescalating and undermining regional peace, security, \r\nand stability.\r\nAt the 47th meeting of the Ministers for Foreign \r\nAffairs of ASEAN, in Nay Pyi Taw, the Philippines \r\nproposed the triple action plan to reduce tensions. \r\nOur triple action plan proposal contains immediate, \r\nintermediate and final approaches to address the \r\nprovocative and destabilizing activities in the South \r\nChina Sea. It is a positive, comprehensive and \r\nconstructive framework that brings together various \r\ninitiatives that the Philippines and other countries have \r\nbeen advocating on the issue of the South China Sea for \r\nseveral years.\r\nAs an immediate approach, the triple action plan \r\ncalls for the cessation of specific activities that escalate \r\ntensions in the region, pursuant to paragraph 5 of \r\nthe 2002 ASEAN-China Declaration on the Conduct \r\nof Parties in the South China Sea. Paragraph 5 calls \r\nfor, first, self-restraint; secondly, no inhabitation of \r\nuninhabited features, including massive reclamation; \r\nand thirdly, the handling of differences in a constructive \r\n14-55181 47/48\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.17\r\nmanner. For the intermediate approach to managing \r\ntensions until a final resolution is achieved, the triple \r\naction plan highlights the need for the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the Declaration and the expeditious \r\nconclusion of a code of conduct. As a final approach, the \r\ntriple action plan underscores the need for a settlement \r\nmechanism to bring the disputes to a final and enduring \r\nresolution anchored in international law.\r\nThe Philippines is pursuing such a resolution \r\nthrough arbitration and believes that the arbitration \r\ndecision will clarify maritime entitlements and will pave \r\nthe way for the full resolution of the maritime disputes \r\nin the South China Sea. Those approaches under the \r\ntriple action plan can be pursued simultaneously, and \r\nthey do not prejudice territorial claims. We enjoin all to \r\nbe united in addressing the challenge of resolving this \r\nissue in accordance with the rule of law.\r\nOn disarmament, the Philippines is deeply \r\nconcerned about the threat of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, from the Middle East to the Korean \r\npeninsula. The Philippines has remained firm in \r\nits position on the total and complete elimination \r\nof nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The \r\nPhilippines strongly believes that the conference on \r\nthe establishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction \r\nshould be convened as soon as possible. The Six-Party \r\nTalks on the Korean peninsula should restart. We need \r\na successful outcome to the 2015 Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons to ensure the credibility of the Treaty.\r\nThe Philippines strongly supports the ongoing \r\ndiscourse on the humanitarian consequences of nuclear \r\nweapons that has been gaining ground within and \r\noutside the United Nations. We will continue to lend \r\nour voice to calls for nuclear disarmament until we have \r\nreached the goal of global zero. The Philippines also \r\ndeplores the use of landmines and improvised explosive \r\ndevices and the illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons, which, unfortunately, still continue around \r\nthe world.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions are crucial \r\nto international peace and security. The Philippines, \r\nthrough its continuous participation in peacekeeping \r\nmissions, has shown its steadfast commitment to \r\ncontributing to that worthy cause. Let me take this \r\nopportunity to thank our partners in the international \r\ncommunity for their invaluable assistance in recent \r\nincidents involving our Philippine peacekeepers, \r\nspecifically in the United Nations Disengagement \r\nObserver Force in the Golan Heights. Our collective \r\naction has highlighted the importance that the \r\ninternational community continues to accord to United \r\nNations peacekeeping.\r\nIn the face of grave danger, Filipino peacekeepers \r\nhave bravely helped to safeguard world peace. They have \r\nserved with honour, distinction and professionalism in \r\nimplementing peacekeeping mandates. We are deeply \r\nconcerned about the continuing and emerging dangers \r\nfaced by all United Nations peacekeepers, and urge the \r\nUnited Nations and all fellow Member States to ensure \r\nthat those dangers are addressed comprehensively. \r\nWe believe that outstanding operational and tactical \r\nissues relating to United Nations peacekeeping must be \r\nresolved at the highest levels as soon as possible. The \r\nPhilippines reiterates its solid commitment to upholding \r\nmultilateral peacekeeping, collective security and the \r\nrule of law.\r\nWhen we speak of inclusive development, we must \r\ntake into full account the invaluable contributions \r\nthat migrant workers make to global development and \r\nprogress. Their well-being is a shared responsibility \r\nand part of the international community’s commitment \r\nto promoting inclusive societies. Those migrants are \r\nespecially vulnerable in times of conflict and should \r\nnot be forgotten. They deserve the complete support \r\nand cooperation of the international community in \r\nensuring their safety, security and well-being. For such \r\nan important task, all countries — whether receiving, \r\ntransit or sending — must be fully involved.\r\nWe are also alarmed that migrants, particularly \r\nwomen and children, continue to be victims of \r\ntrafficking. National and international efforts to \r\nprevent trafficking, prosecute traffickers and assist \r\nin the recovery and rehabilitation of victims must be \r\nstrengthened. From a broader perspective, we should \r\nfully respect the rights of migrants by according them \r\nequal treatment in all countries. The Philippines will \r\ncontinue to support efforts to protect the basic rights of \r\nmigrants, recognize their contributions to development \r\nand secure for them a place in the inclusive societies \r\nthat we envision in the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nAs we discuss and negotiate the best ways to deliver \r\nand implement the post-2015 development agenda, we \r\nshould take concrete action on the proposed United \r\nNations reforms that have been the subject of years of \r\ndiscussions and dialogues. The Philippines supports \r\nchange and reform in the United Nations to strengthen \r\n48/48 14-55181\r\nA/69/PV.17 29/09/2014\r\nits ability to meet new demands and deliver its mandate \r\nin the most effective, transparent, accountable and \r\nefficient manner. Reforms should include a better \r\nselection process for the Secretary-General, the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and executive heads \r\nof the United Nations; an increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council; a review of the use of the veto \r\npower in the Security Council; an increased budget \r\nfor peacekeeping missions; and ways to make full and \r\neffective use of partnerships across the range of United \r\nNations activities. For example, if we were to elect a \r\nwoman to be the next Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, that would be a powerful signal on gender \r\nequality and empowerment.\r\nAs we set the stage to roll out a new set of goals \r\nfor the post-2015 development agenda, let us not lose \r\ntrack of the equal importance of an enabling political \r\nand social environment to support the goals. When \r\nconflicts and insecurity endure, when disasters strike, \r\nwhen pandemics break out, when terrorism spreads \r\nand when the Earth’s bounties are confronted with \r\ndepletion, we face the real danger that our development \r\nagenda will fail. It is our responsibility, therefore, as \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, to exert every \r\neffort and expend every resource at our command to \r\nmake the United Nations the instrument for promoting \r\npeace, progress and development.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.20 p.m.\r\n"
