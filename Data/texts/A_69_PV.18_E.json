Here we are, meeting again to evaluate \r\nwhat has been accomplished and to consider new \r\nsolutions to the many challenges confronting our shared \r\nresponsibility. And Burkina Faso is committed, as \r\nalways, to participating in this important get-together, \r\nthe symbol of international solidarity.\r\nI would like to express our gratitude to \r\nPresident Kutesa’s predecessor, Ambassador John \r\nAshe, for his positive record during his tenure. I also \r\nheartily congratulate the President on his election, \r\nand I am confident that his wealth of experience with \r\ninternational and development issues will enable \r\nhim to effectively guide our work on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, in order to formulate an ambitious \r\nnew framework for development aimed at bringing our \r\npeoples growth, fairness and a better life. \r\nI would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his thoughtful focus on \r\npeace and social and economic development around the \r\nworld, especially in Africa. In that regard, I welcome \r\nhis initiative in holding last week’s Climate Summit \r\nin New York, aimed at persuading Heads of State and \r\nGovernment and representatives of local authorities, \r\nthe private sector and civil society of the urgent and \r\ncompelling need for them to declare their contributions \r\nto the fight against climate change in firm and concrete \r\nterms.\r\nBurkina Faso also reiterates its commendation of \r\nthe joint visit to the Sahel by the Secretary-General, \r\nthe Chairperson of the African Union Commission, the \r\nPresident of the World Bank, the President of the African \r\nDevelopment Bank and the European Commissioner \r\nfor Development within the framework of the United \r\nNations integrated strategy for the Sahel, which aims to \r\npromote security, good governance, development and \r\nhuman rights as factors of peace and stability.\r\nLastly, Burkina Faso welcomes the Assembly’s \r\nadoption of the Secretary-General’s Ebola initiative \r\n(resolution 69/1) and welcomes his appointment of \r\nMr. David Nabarro as Senior United Nations System \r\nCoordinator for Ebola Virus Disease and Mr. Anthony \r\nBanbury as his Special Representative and Head of the \r\nUnited Nations Mission on Ebola Emergency Response. \r\nThese steps will certainly help the West African \r\nsubregion to strengthen its public-health systems in \r\norder to eradicate the epidemic, whose spread could \r\npermanently compromise the area’s social cohesion, \r\ndevelopment and economic integration. Burkina Faso \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.18\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n18th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 29 September 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nwould like to express its sympathy and solidarity with \r\nthe affected countries, and it reiterates its commitment \r\nto participating in the quest for a collective solution \r\nthat can ensure effective protection for the people and \r\nfor health personnel, as well as the free movement of \r\npeople and goods within the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States (ECOWAS).\r\nToday we can celebrate the progress made in efforts \r\nto achieve and maintain peace, as well as to achieve our \r\ndevelopment goals, despite the fact that there is still \r\nwork to be done to speed up improvement of our people’s \r\nliving conditions. In Burkina Faso, notwithstanding our \r\nunfavourable geographical and climatic conditions and \r\na difficult international economic environment, we are \r\ncommitted, with determination and realism, to building \r\ndevelopment. In the last few decades, therefore, we have \r\nestablished and implemented strategic development \r\nprogrammes and plans designed to put our country \r\nfirmly on the road to emergence. Poverty reduction, \r\nthe empowerment of women and full employment for \r\nyoung people are some of our main objectives. For \r\nseveral years consecutively those efforts have enabled \r\nBurkina Faso to record average annual growth rates of \r\naround 5 per cent and achieve significant investments \r\nin a number of areas that include health, education, \r\nagriculture, and water, road and energy infrastructures.\r\nClearly, development efforts cannot thrive without \r\na stable, peaceful environment. To that end, our \r\nPresident, Mr. Blaise Compaoré, and the Government \r\nof Burkina Faso continue to work to entrench a culture \r\nof tolerance and peaceful coexistence that seeks to \r\nestablish, through dialogue and consultations, the \r\nessential elements of social cohesion, a strengthened \r\ndemocratic process and respect for individual and \r\ncollective liberties. \r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nBurkina Faso continues to set a good example by \r\nmaking the promotion and defence of human rights a \r\nmajor focus of its Government policy on improving the \r\npeople’s welfare. That has been the context for the work \r\nof Mrs. Chantal Compaoré, a goodwill ambassador for \r\nthe Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices \r\nAffecting the Health of Women and Children, whose \r\ncommitment to dealing with the issue of female genital \r\nmutilation is an important contribution to global efforts \r\nto protect the rights of women and girls. Burkina Faso \r\nwelcomes the Human Rights Council’s recent adoption \r\nof a draft resolution on “Intensifying global efforts and \r\nsharing good practices to effectively eliminate female \r\ngenital mutilation” , submitted by the African Group at \r\nBurkina Faso’s initiative.\r\nWe are following with concern the crises and \r\nconflicts that unfortunately continue to plague parts \r\nof the world, particularly the African continent. \r\nHowever, under the auspices of ECOWAS, we welcome \r\nthe significant progress made over recent months \r\nin restoring peace and democracy in West Africa, \r\nespecially in Guinea-Bissau and Mali. \r\nWith respect to Mali, ECOWAS mediation brought \r\nabout the restoration of constitutional order and the \r\nholding of free and fair elections throughout the national \r\nterritory. For the continuation of the peace process in \r\nMali, Burkina Faso welcomes and supports the efforts \r\nof the People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria in the \r\nsearch for a lasting peace solution in accordance with \r\nthe Preliminary Agreement signed in Ouagadougou \r\non 18 June 2013. That Agreement’s ultimate goal is to \r\nrestore peace, the territorial integrity of Mali and of \r\nthe ECOWAS region, and cohesion among all Malian \r\ncommunities, in order to achieve the objectives of \r\nharmonious development and subregional integration. \r\nIn Mali, as elsewhere in the Sahel subregion, \r\narmed conflicts are becoming more complex and \r\nmore radicalized because of the emergence of violent \r\nextremism and terrorism closely associated with the \r\ncriminal economy, which is characterized, inter alia, by \r\ntrafficking in drugs, weapons and human beings. Those \r\nevils challenge us in our shared responsibility in the \r\nfight to eradicate them. It is more urgent than ever to \r\nwork together by focusing on preventive measures and \r\naddressing their root causes, namely such predisposing \r\nfactors as extreme poverty, youth unemployment, and \r\nthe denial of rights and justice. \r\nSimilarly, it is important to strengthen the rapid- \r\nresponse capabilities of our States and international \r\ncooperation in the exchange of information, in order \r\nto allow our defence forces and security to fight \r\neffectively against terrorist threats. In that regard, \r\nBurkina Faso expresses its deep gratitude to all partner \r\ncountries, especially France and the United States of \r\nAmerica, whose contribution to the efforts to secure the \r\nSahel is priceless. We would now like to reiterate our \r\ntotal solidarity with and full support for the people and \r\nGovernment of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which \r\ncontinue to face the unprecedented rise of terrorism \r\nand religious intolerance. \r\n14-55187 3/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nOther African countries are also experiencing crisis \r\nsituations. We are thinking in particular of Somalia, \r\nLibya, the Central African Republic, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Congo and the Sudan. With respect to \r\nthe Central African Republic, Burkina Faso salutes \r\nthe efforts of the international mediator, President \r\nSassou Nguesso, and welcomes the Brazzaville Forum, \r\nwhich concluded with an agreement on the cessation \r\nof hostilities. My country supports the Transitional \r\nGovernment, welcomes the effective establishment \r\nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic \r\nand reiterates its readiness to contribute to efforts to \r\nrestore and keep peace in Central Africa. \r\nIn the light of all these crises, Burkina Faso would \r\nemphasize the urgent need to restore and maintain an \r\nenvironment of peace and stability in the countries \r\nconcerned, without which our development and \r\nintegration efforts will be in vain. In that context, no \r\neffort should be spared to protect peacekeepers who \r\nrisk their lives working to provide security and comfort \r\nto civilians. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto reiterate our strong condemnation of intentional \r\nattacks against all United Nations troops in theatres of \r\npeacekeeping. \r\nAs it always has, Burkina Faso will continue to \r\nparticipate in the collective action of peacekeeping \r\nin countries in difficulty, in particular Darfur, Mali, \r\nGuinea-Bissau, the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand Haiti. We express our deep appreciation to partner \r\ncountries for their various forms of support in terms of \r\ntraining and equipment, which allow Burkinabé troops \r\nto accomplish their tasks efficiently wherever they are \r\nsent. \r\nWith respect to conflict resolution, Burkina Faso \r\nadvocates dialogue and consultation, which is the basis \r\nfor Burkina Faso’s consistent action when the President \r\nof our country is sought after as a mediator or facilitator. \r\nAccordingly, I welcome the adoption on 31 July by the \r\nAssembly of resolution 68/303 on “Strengthening the \r\nrole of mediation in the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nconflict prevention and resolution”. In that regard, my \r\ncountry, a member of the Group of Friends of Mediation, \r\nencourages the actions taken under the leadership of \r\nFinland and Turkey. \r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, Burkina Faso \r\nwelcomes the Moroccan initiative for advanced \r\nautonomy status in Western Sahara, which is a credible \r\nand realistic option for achieving a final solution \r\nacceptable to all. \r\nIn the Middle East, we condemn the recent \r\nescalation of violence which has led to many casualties \r\namong civilian populations. Priority should be given to \r\ndialogue, and we hope that the unrestricted ceasefire \r\nthat was signed between Palestinians and Israelis \r\non 26 August 2014, under the auspices of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, will lead to the establishment of a \r\ndefinitive peace between the two parties to the conflict. \r\nAccordingly, Burkina Faso welcomes the efforts of the \r\ninternational community aimed at creating a Palestinian \r\nState living side by side with Israel in peace, security \r\nand mutual respect. \r\nThe establishment of international peace and \r\nsecurity will be but hollow words as long as the issue \r\nof disarmament remains unresolved. Therefore, no \r\nsacrifice is too great if together we can achieve a world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons, a reduction in the risk of the \r\nproliferation of conventional weapons, and the entry \r\ninto force and universalization of the Arms Trade \r\nTreaty. \r\nTo establish a permanent basis for peace, security \r\nand freedom, it is also necessary to create the \r\nconditions for sustainable and equitable development \r\nfor all peoples. That is why my country reaffirms \r\nits strong commitment to the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We therefore have a \r\ndeep interest in the development process under way for \r\nthe sustainable development goals and the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, and we urge that special attention \r\nbe given to vital sectors such as agriculture, renewable \r\nenergy, industrialization and infrastructure. \r\nBurkina Faso reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nideals of the United Nations based on the principles of \r\npeaceful coexistence, dialogue and peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. It is with conviction that we welcome and \r\nstrongly encourage the rapprochement of views between \r\nthe People’s Republic of China and the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan and the dialogue that forms the basis \r\nfor such an approach. We favour the wider participation \r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan in the specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations. \r\nWe salute the spirit of understanding displayed by \r\nthe international community in allowing the involvement \r\nof that country in international organizations in order to \r\nenable it to play a broader role on the world stage through \r\nits contribution to the achievement of development \r\n4/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\ngoals, particularly in countries like Burkina Faso. \r\nReadmitting the Republic of China on Taiwan to our \r\nOrganization is worth considering. With 23 million \r\ninhabitants and a large economy, the Republic of China \r\non Taiwan has established itself as a key player in the \r\ninternational arena in terms of promoting peace and \r\ncontributing to development efforts. \r\nWith regard to Cuba, Burkina Faso reiterates its \r\nposition in favour of lifting the embargo in order to \r\nallow the Cuban people to fit harmoniously into the \r\nconcert of nations. \r\nConvinced of the irreplaceable role of the United \r\nNations in promoting multilateralism, my country \r\nsupports the reforms under consideration, in particular \r\nthose of the Security Council and the General Assembly. \r\nGiven the nature of the new factors in the threats to \r\ninternational peace and security, it is necessary and \r\nequitable that other continents have permanent seats \r\non the Security Council. That is why Burkina Faso \r\nendorses the African Common Position in favour of \r\nexpanding the number of permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council to take into account the expectations \r\nof the African continent. \r\nWith everyone’s help and moved by a spirit of \r\nsolidarity and sharing, we can strengthen the role of the \r\nUnited Nations as a genuine instrument of cooperation \r\nfor peace, security, justice and development. \r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Hor Namhong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of \r\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia.\r\nMr. Hor Namhong (Cambodia): At the outset, \r\nallow me to warmly congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa of \r\nthe Republic of Uganda on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I have \r\nfull confidence that, under his guidance, the sixty-ninth \r\nsession will proceed to a successful conclusion. I would \r\nalso like to take the opportunity to extend my great \r\nappreciation to Mr. John William Ashe of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda for his wise leadership and relentless efforts \r\nas President of the sixty-eighth session in guiding us to \r\nmany outstanding achievements.\r\nIn many ways, the world in which we are living \r\nis at a critical juncture, and the current picture is \r\nrather bleak. The international community remains \r\nseriously concerned over recent geopolitical security \r\ndevelopments in many parts of the world. The self-\r\ndeclared Islamic State in Iraq and Syria and its \r\nhorrendous crimes are menacing peace, security and \r\nstability in those countries, which have already been \r\nseriously hit by armed conflicts and acts of violence. \r\nIn Syria, the continued armed hostilities have not only \r\ncaused the deaths of thousands of innocent people and \r\nchildren, but have also led to millions of refugees. \r\nIn Africa, some countries have also suffered armed \r\nconflicts and violence, which have placed peace and \r\nstability at risk in that part of the world. All those armed \r\nconflicts and crimes are threatening peace, stability \r\nand human security, not only in those regions, but also \r\nin the world at large.\r\nTo contribute to the peace process in the Middle \r\nEast and Africa, Cambodia has participated actively \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. We have \r\ndispatched more than 2,000 peacekeepers to Lebanon, \r\nMali and South Sudan. In November, Cambodia will \r\ndeploy another detachment of 216 peacekeepers to \r\nthe United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic.\r\nWhile extremism is threatening the world’s peace \r\nand security, the spread of the Ebola epidemic in Africa \r\nhas also become one of the worst threats to the world \r\ntoday. It is of critical importance that the international \r\ncommunity make concerted efforts to address that \r\nglobal challenge in an effective and timely manner.\r\nWith regard to the hostilities between Palestine and \r\nIsrael, despite the fragile ceasefire recently concluded, \r\nthe situation remains a serious concern. We call on all \r\nparties to make efforts to resume meaningful peace \r\ntalks in order to reach a viable political solution of \r\ntwo States living peacefully side by side. Cambodia \r\nbelieves that that is the only way to definitively put an \r\nend to that long-lasting conflict. \r\nThe situation in the eastern part of Europe, in spite \r\nof the delicate ceasefire, remains worrisome and its \r\nimplications could presage a return to the Cold War. \r\nIn Asia, the launching of missiles by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has aroused international \r\nconcern and aggravated the situation in the region. The \r\nSix-Party Talks should be resumed in order to explore \r\na possible avenue for peaceful dialogue to bring about \r\na peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nClimate change is currently an obvious global \r\nchallenge, as well as a human security issue. The rapid \r\npace of climate change is having devastating effects \r\nfor both developed and developing countries. The \r\ndeveloping countries, dependent mostly on agriculture, \r\n14-55187 5/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nsuffer more from the various negative effects of climate \r\nchange, such as frequent typhoons, storms, f loods \r\nand droughts. For instance, in 2013, heavy monsoon \r\nrains caused extensive f looding across Cambodia, \r\nclaimed 168 lives, caused $1 billion in damages and \r\naffected 1.8 million people. Even this year, 12 out of \r\nthe 25 provinces and various cities of Cambodia have \r\nsuffered on account of f loods, killing 45 people and \r\nafflicting almost 100,000 families.\r\nAccording to a report by the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change, the global warming caused \r\nby the increase in greenhouse gases is generated by \r\nhumankind’s use of fossil fuels. There is no doubt \r\nthat the industrialized countries, which consume most \r\nof the world’s fossil fuels, emit the largest amount of \r\ngreenhouse gas, while the developing countries, which \r\nproduce only small amounts of such gases, are the main \r\nvictims of climate change. It is therefore imperative \r\nthat the international community provide further \r\nimpetus to revitalize and prioritize actions to address \r\nclimate change based on the United Nations principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. \r\nWith that concept in mind and while applauding the \r\nfruitful outcome of the recent United Nations Climate \r\nSummit, held on 23 September in New York, Cambodia \r\nhopes that the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Paris in December 2015, will \r\nbring about concrete measures to reach a new global \r\nagreement with legal force applicable to all parties \r\nunder the Framework Convention.\r\nIn line with the United Nations principles for \r\nsustainable development and in order to mitigate \r\nthe threat of climate change, Cambodia has adopted \r\nits national strategic plan on green development for \r\n2013-2030, which aims at achieving economic and \r\nsocial development in a sustainable manner, while at \r\nthe same time protecting the environment, through the \r\nefficient use of raw materials and natural resources, \r\nclean development and green preservation. Cambodia \r\nhas also adopted several legal instruments for green \r\ngrowth development, including the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding on green growth cooperation between \r\nCambodia and South Korea’s Global Green Growth \r\nInstitute and the National Council on Green Growth.\r\nSouth-East Asia, which is highly vulnerable to \r\nthe adverse impacts of climate change, established \r\nthe Climate Change Initiative of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2009 as a \r\nconsultative body to further increase the region’s \r\ncapacity in both mitigation and adaptation efforts. As \r\na member of ASEAN, Cambodia is fully engaged in \r\nthe implementation of that ASEAN initiative through \r\nthe ASEAN Working Group on Climate Change and \r\nthe ASEAN Action Plan on Joint Response to Climate \r\nChange, with the goal of enhancing closer and deeper \r\nregional and international cooperation on climate \r\nchange.\r\nNext year marks the deadline of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). While some MDG targets \r\nhave been achieved, we have to acknowledge that much \r\nmore effort is need to reach the set goals of the MDGs, \r\nas progress has been uneven and insufficient. Many \r\ndeveloping countries have not attained their MDG \r\ntargets, primarily owing to unfulfilled commitments, \r\nlack of resources, insufficient dedication, and food \r\ninsecurity. The situation was further aggravated by the \r\nfinancial uncertainty in the developed countries, which \r\nhas had an impact on their commitment to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. Therefore, bolder and more \r\nfocused global efforts are needed as we approach the \r\nfinal year to realize the MDGs.\r\nWith the aim of realizing the MDGs, Cambodia \r\nhas adopted its own development targets, known as \r\nthe Cambodia MDGs, which have been incorporated \r\ncomprehensively into our National Strategic \r\nDevelopment Plan 2014-2018. As a result, substantial \r\nprogress has been achieved, positioning Cambodia \r\nto meet some goals of the MDGs by the end of 2015. \r\nCambodia’s target in reducing the poverty rate to \r\n19.5 per cent by 2015 has already been achieved ahead \r\nof schedule, as the nation’s poverty rate had already \r\nfallen to 19 per cent in 2013. As a result, Cambodia \r\nreceived a United Nations Award for cutting hunger in \r\nhalf before the deadline.\r\nIn combating HIV/AIDS, Cambodia has made great \r\nstrides by progressively reducing HIV prevalence to \r\n0.6 per cent in 2013. In order to achieve that indicator, the \r\nCambodian Government has further adopted a getting-\r\nto-zero policy, aiming to realize zero new infections, \r\nzero AIDS-related deaths and zero discrimination by \r\n2020.\r\nIn addition to tracking the Cambodia MDGs \r\nachievements, the Royal Government of Cambodia has \r\nput forth a Cambodia MDGs acceleration framework \r\nwith an approach aimed at accelerating progress in \r\nachieving the MDGs and other human development \r\ngoals. The framework could provide the essential \r\n6/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\ninput for the implementation of our National Strategic \r\nDevelopment Plan 2014-2018 aimed at completing the \r\nremaining MDGs, as well as at setting the stage for the \r\npreparation of the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nCambodia shares the view expressed in the \r\nreport of the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on \r\nthe Post-2015 Development Agenda, entitled A New \r\nGlobal Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and Transform \r\nEconomies through Sustainable Development, to be \r\nadopted during the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly, that\r\n“a new development agenda should carry forward \r\nthe spirit of the Millennium Declaration and the \r\nbest of the MDGs, with a practical focus on things \r\nlike poverty, hunger, water, sanitation, education \r\nand health care”.\r\nCambodia is of the view that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda should be realistic and built \r\nupon the lessons learned from the difficulties in \r\nthe realization of the MDGs; in particular, it should \r\nensure that any process towards a broader development \r\nobjective is truly balanced and comprehensive.\r\nNext year, 2015, is a crucial year as the United \r\nNations celebrates the seventieth anniversary of its \r\ncreation and the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World \r\nSummit, where world leaders agreed to reform the \r\nUnited Nations to meet the needs of today’s geopolitical \r\nand global challenges (resolution 60/1). To that end, \r\nthe General Assembly should be further empowered \r\nso that it can play a leading role in strengthening the \r\nwider United Nations system. The Security Council, as \r\na body mandated with the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nshould represent the world’s realities today. In sum, we \r\nthink that more equitable representation in the United \r\nNations organs would assist the Organization in coping \r\nwith the urgent global challenges.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Murray McCully, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nNew Zealand.\r\nMr. McCully (New Zealand): It is an honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly today on behalf of the \r\nPrime Minister and Government of New Zealand. Our \r\ngeneral election took place in the past week. Our Prime \r\nMinister, the Right Honourable John Key, is engaged in \r\nforming a Government, and that is why he is unable to \r\nbe in New York today.\r\nI want to begin by acknowledging the success of \r\nthe recent third International Conference on Small \r\nIsland Developing States, held in Samoa. The success \r\nof the Conference was the result of the extraordinary \r\nwork Samoa put into preparing for the Conference and \r\nthe ownership of the agenda that was demonstrated by \r\nthe small island developing States (SIDS). While it is \r\nundoubtedly true that small island developing States \r\nhave placed great value on the opportunity to talk, it \r\nis also true that there was an undertone of frustration, \r\nborn of the fact that too often in the past talk has not \r\nbeen followed by action. I strongly identify with that \r\nview. The multilateral world is awash with talk of plans \r\nand strategies and funds, while out there in the real \r\nworld of small island developing States, not enough is \r\nhappening on the ground. My country, New Zealand, is \r\nintent on avoiding that shortcoming, especially in our \r\nown region, the Pacific.\r\nRenewable energy featured strongly in the SIDS \r\nConference agenda, as it had at the Secretary-General’s \r\n2014 Climate Summit in the past week. Pacific nations \r\nspend 10 per cent of their gross domestic product and up \r\nto 30 per cent of their entire import bills on importing \r\ndiesel fuel for electricity generation. Sustainable \r\neconomic development therefore simply cannot happen \r\nin our region without renewable energy.\r\nSignificant progress is being achieved, especially \r\nsince the Pacific Energy Summit 2013 that we co-hosted \r\nwith the European Union in Auckland in March 2013, \r\nat which $635 million in funding was committed for \r\nover 50 projects. The Tokelau Islands have moved from \r\n100 per cent dependence on fossil fuels to 93 per cent \r\nrenewable. During the SIDS Conference itself, we \r\nopened a 2.2-megawatt plant, a solar array in Samoa. \r\nA year earlier we opened a 1.2-megawatt plant in \r\nTonga. Next month, we will open a 1-megawatt array in \r\nRarotonga. And in the next 12 months, all of the outer \r\nislands of Tuvalu and all but one of the outer Cook \r\nIslands will be close to 100 per cent renewable. \r\nWe are making real progress towards converting \r\nour Pacific neighbourhood to renewable energy, \r\nbringing significant environmental benefits and \r\ngreatly enhancing prospects for sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment. My country has committed over \r\n$100 million to that process. We are not waiting for a \r\nnew multilateral agreement or a new green fund. We \r\nare simply getting ahead with robust partnerships and \r\nmaking it happen.\r\n14-55187 7/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nAnother key topic at the SIDS Conference was \r\nsustainable fisheries. For our region, that is critically \r\nimportant. The biggest economic asset in the Pacific \r\nis its fisheries. In the past year, over $3.3 billion worth \r\nof tuna was harvested from Pacific waters, yet only \r\n14 per cent of that value, about $460 million, made \r\nits way back to Pacific nations. New Zealand has \r\ncommitted over $70 million over the next five years \r\nto advance a comprehensive approach that includes \r\nenhanced surveillance, training of monitors, training \r\nin commercial fishing practices, research and science \r\ninitiatives and improving management practices. Our \r\nobjective is to see the owners of the Pacific tuna resource \r\nreceive a significantly greater share of the value of that \r\nresource, and to ensure that it is sustainably managed \r\nfor the future.\r\nA key message from the SIDS Conference is the need \r\nto share experiences and skills among the SIDS regions. \r\nThat is starting to happen. Fisheries management is a \r\nprime candidate for greater cooperation. We have also \r\ncommenced a process of interregional cooperation in \r\nrenewable energy by supporting the development of \r\ngeothermal energy in the Caribbean and Africa.\r\nWhile small island developing States are showing \r\nreal leadership in addressing climate change and \r\nshifting to renewable energy, those issues require action \r\non a global scale. We therefore commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for convening the Climate Summit here in \r\nNew York last week. We are participating actively in \r\nthose negotiations and hope they will pave the way for \r\na successful conclusion in Paris next year. We have \r\nmade an initial commitment to the Green Climate \r\nFund to show our support for the global effort, but we \r\nwill unashamedly continue to prioritize making real \r\nprogress with real projects in our own region, which \r\nwill continue to consume the bulk of our resources.\r\nThe other major event that has recently taken place \r\nin the Pacific is the election in Fiji. We congratulate the \r\nPrime Minister, his party and the people of Fiji on their \r\nsuccessful return to democratic rule. Fiji’s successful \r\nelections are hugely important for the region. I am \r\ndelighted that following the preliminary report of the \r\nmultinational observers group, both the Pacific Islands \r\nForum and the Commonwealth have commenced the \r\nprocess of lifting Fiji’s suspension. We look forward to \r\nrebuilding and strengthening the connections between \r\nus. Neither New Zealand nor Fiji can contemplate a \r\nfuture that does not entail close and continuing links \r\nwith the other. We also welcomed the safe return of the \r\nFiji peacekeepers who were held hostage in the Golan \r\nHeights. That incident again underlined the great \r\nchallenges and the dangers faced by United Nations \r\npeacekeepers and the responsibilities we all have to \r\nensure the safety and security of peacekeeping and \r\nother United Nations personnel.\r\nIt is as well that we are able to note some bright \r\nspots for our region, because the situation in other parts \r\nof the world does look bleak. \r\nWhat happened over the past few months in \r\nGaza was an affront to humanity. No good was done \r\nfor the cause of Palestine by Hamas firing rockets \r\nindiscriminately into Israel. No good was done for peace \r\nin the Middle East by Israel pounding Gaza with such \r\nintensity and at such cost of civilian lives. We welcome \r\nthe ceasefire that was agreed after so many false starts \r\nand are thankful that so far it endures. We call on all \r\nsides not only to keep the guns and rockets silent but to \r\nrefrain from actions that may destabilize what can only \r\nbe described as an uneasy peace. In that connection, we \r\nexpress our profound regret at Israel’s appropriation of \r\n400 hectares of privately owned Palestinian land near \r\nBethlehem for settlements. That act itself is profoundly \r\nunhelpful.\r\nThe problems of the Middle East are deep and \r\ndifficult. They go back to the earliest days of the \r\nOrganization and beyond. But what happened over \r\nthe past months in and in relation to Gaza was a \r\nmodern failure — a failure of leadership, of purpose \r\nand of vision. We urge the leaders of Israel and of \r\nPalestine, both West Bank and Gaza, to live up to their \r\nresponsibilities to their peoples and to their positions.\r\nIn Syria and Iraq, we see the truly frightening \r\nconsequences when leadership, both internally and \r\nin the Security Council, has failed. Syria has been a \r\nweeping sore for over three years. Thousands of Syrians \r\nhave died, millions have become refugees and all \r\nSyrian people have suffered terribly from the multiple \r\nconflicts engulfing the country. And now the tragedy \r\nof Syria has spilled over into Iraq, which was already \r\nwrestling with its own deep-seated problems. Many \r\nactors, in both the recent past and over a longer time \r\nframe, have had a hand in contributing to the situation \r\nwe now confront, but now it is time for action.\r\nWe need to find a way to contain the madness that \r\nis the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, to address \r\nthe humanitarian tragedy and to help the people of Syria \r\nand Iraq craft a better future. By any objective standard, \r\n8/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nthat is a situation that cries out for Security Council \r\nattention, and that is true of both sides of the border. \r\nWe need the Council members and the Governments \r\nconcerned to move past the ideological stalemate that \r\nhas kept the Council largely impotent for the past three \r\nyears. The challenge we all face in Syria and Iraq is \r\nunlike any the United Nations has faced before. The \r\npolitical circumstances in which it is being played out \r\nare about as bad as they get. Yet somehow we must find \r\na way of coming together to defeat that shared problem.\r\nParalysis has also prevailed in the Security Council \r\nover Ukraine. The Council has been essentially \r\na bystander as one of its permanent members has \r\nundermined the integrity of another Member State. We \r\nrecognize the difficulties of managing ethnic tensions \r\nthat straddle borders and the risks of local fires being \r\nstoked into wider national and international crises. But \r\nwith the strong shared histories of cooperation and \r\nachievement between Russia and Ukraine, there is no \r\nexcuse for leaders allowing matters to unravel as they \r\nhave, to the point where international peace and security \r\nmay be at risk. Already hundreds of innocent civilians \r\non Flight MH-17 lost their lives through an associated \r\nmistake and miscalculation. We welcome the ceasefire \r\nagreed earlier this month, which has held, for the most \r\npart. We call on all involved to step back, think about \r\nwhat is at stake and start rebuilding the trust essential \r\nto finding a lasting solution.\r\nEvents in the Middle East and Ukraine have \r\ndominated the headlines in recent months and have \r\ndiverted attention from the serious situations that \r\ncontinue to play out in Africa, particularly in Libya, \r\nMali, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, \r\nSomalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The \r\nUnited Nations is directly involved in those crises, \r\nand they continue to challenge the capacity of the \r\nOrganization and of the African Union to respond \r\nto the sheer scale of human suffering and to the \r\ncontinuing need for external assistance to restore and \r\nkeep the peace, keep civilian populations safe and \r\ndeliver humanitarian assistance. Those issues, no less \r\nthan those in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, \r\nwill continue to require constant attention from the \r\nSecurity Council and the coordinated efforts of the \r\nbroader United Nations family. They show that for all \r\nits failings and structural inequalities, the Council still \r\nhas a vital role to play in maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nBut there is one lesson that we must learn from \r\nall those recent crises — the United Nations must \r\nfundamentally improve its performance in preventing \r\nconflict. Once fighting is in full spate, the options for \r\npeace disappear. Prevention is critical, not just in new \r\nconflicts, but also in the cases on the agenda where \r\nconflict has been frozen or where peacebuilding has \r\nnot really taken hold.\r\nWe are deeply troubled by the unprecedented scale \r\nof the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. We recognize \r\nthe huge challenges it poses to the economies and \r\nthe political and security cohesion in the region. We \r\nhave contributed and will continue to contribute to the \r\nhumanitarian work under way, and on the formation of \r\na new Government, we will look at further practical \r\nsteps to support the international effort.\r\nIn 18 days’ time, the United Nations membership \r\nwill decide who will be on the Security Council for the \r\nnext two-year term. New Zealand has been a candidate \r\nfor that position since 2004. It has been 20 years since \r\nwe were last on the Council. It has been a long and \r\ndemanding campaign, and it will continue right up to \r\nthe elections on 16 October. With tough competitors, \r\nsuch as our good friends Spain and Turkey, that has to \r\nbe the case. The campaign has been a great opportunity \r\nfor us to engage with nations around the world. We \r\ngreatly value the new relationships we have forged \r\nand the enhanced character of existing relationships. \r\nWhatever the outcome, we are determined to maintain \r\nthem. \r\nIn the past, New Zealand has demonstrated that as \r\na member of the Council it acts strongly, effectively and \r\nindependently. It champions the rights of small States \r\nand for the voices of all to be heard. In short, as my \r\nPrime Minister said from this rostrum last year, there \r\nis no point in joining the Council simply to make up the \r\nnumbers. Sometimes one has to speak up and shine a \r\nlight on what is going on, or not going on, even when it \r\nis embarassing or inconvenient to others to do so.\r\nAbove all, I can assure the Assembly that if we \r\nare elected, New Zealand will be a credible, positive \r\ninfluence on the Security Council. At our core, New \r\nZealand is an optimistic country and New Zealanders \r\nare an optimistic people. We believe that things can be \r\nbetter than they are and are prepared, as a people, to \r\nwork hard to achieve that. Despite the many challenges \r\non the international agenda, my hope is that the \r\nmembership of the United Nations will give us an \r\n14-55187 9/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nopportunity to prove that by serving on the Security \r\nCouncil from next year.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. K. Shanmugam, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Shanmugam (Singapore): I wish to convey \r\nour congratulations to Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session. We wish him success in the coming \r\nyear.\r\nWe are not living in the worst of times, but they \r\nare not the best of times either. Standards of living are \r\nfar higher for more of the human race than ever before. \r\nBut we face global crises of several types: internal \r\nand cross-border conflicts, epidemics, disasters both \r\nnatural and man-made, climate change and international \r\ncrime. We are facing grave threats from terrorism and \r\nextremism. The latest manifestation is the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). It is brutal and \r\ncruel and a travesty of all that religion stands for. Its \r\nunspeakable acts of cruelty, including abductions and \r\nbrutal murders of civilians, constitute crimes against \r\nhumanity. Singapore condemns those terrorist actions \r\nin the strongest possible terms. ISIS will continue to \r\ntarget those who do not conform to its extremist agenda.\r\nThe threat of such terrorism and radical ideology \r\nis not confined to the Middle East. It affects the whole \r\nworld. An estimated 15,000 foreigners from at least \r\n80 countries, including from South-East Asia, have \r\ntravelled to Syria and Iraq to fight. That fact that ISIS \r\ncan attract so many foreign fighters highlights the \r\nneed for a comprehensive strategy to counter them. In \r\naddition to military and intelligence efforts, we must \r\nalso combat the radical ideology used to recruit foreign \r\nfighters, which fuels their extremist agenda.\r\nSingapore firmly supports all international and \r\nregional cooperation efforts. We welcome the strong \r\nleadership of the United States, in particular in the \r\nformation of the international coalition to combat the \r\nISIS threat. We also welcome the Jeddah Declaration \r\nby Arab countries to stand united against ISIS. Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist \r\nfighters, which Singapore co-sponsored, is an important \r\nstep to combat global terrorism and will be critical to \r\ncutting off financial and material support for ISIS and \r\npreventing the movement of foreign terrorist fighters. \r\nNo country can insulate itself from those problems. \r\nWe need to combat them at all levels. Fair economic \r\ndevelopment, good governance and political and social \r\nstability will be critical in increasing a country’s \r\nresilience against those threats.\r\nThe President’s choice of the theme “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda” for this year’s session and his \r\nemphasis on a comprehensive, action-oriented post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda are particularly timely. Singapore \r\ncommends the work of the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals and looks forward to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report of its recommendations.\r\nWe also welcome the contributions of major \r\nforums, such as the Third International Conference on \r\nSmall Island Developing States (SIDS), recently held \r\nin Samoa. Singapore had the privilege of co-chairing \r\nthe preparatory committee for that forum with New \r\nZealand. It is important that the views and concerns \r\nof small States be properly factored into the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. The Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) were successful due to the pragmatic, \r\noutcome-based and quantifiable approach to the \r\nTargets. We hope that same approach will be taken in \r\nrespect of the post-2015 development agenda. Those \r\nMDGs that were not fully achieved should be included \r\nas an intrinsic part of the post-2015 agenda. \r\nRegarding the principles for sustainable development, \r\nSingapore is participating actively in the discussions \r\nfor the post-2015 period, focusing on those areas where \r\nwe can contribute — key principles that were critical \r\nto our development path and might be relevant to other \r\ndeveloping countries. \r\nFirst is the principle of honest and competent \r\ngovernment. Corruption is a drag on development and \r\nan intrinsic source of social instability. Fighting it \r\nneeds political will, strong leadership and unceasing \r\nvigilance from the whole society. \r\nSecondly, rule of law is integral to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Governments need sound and effective \r\ninstitutions. Those institutions, including the civil \r\nservice, the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, \r\nmust be built on core principles of equal justice and \r\nmeritocracy, regardless of ethnicity, religion or gender. \r\nSocial capital — the trust that people have in one \r\nanother, their leaders and the system — is as necessary \r\nto sustainable development as financial capital. \r\nThe third principle is that economic and social \r\npolicy must be pragmatic, not dogmatic. Singapore \r\ndoes not advocate any standard model of government \r\n10/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nor economic structure. The only model is to work with \r\nwhat you have within the context of a country’s culture \r\nand resources, prudently and for the benefit of the \r\npeople. Policies have to be judged by their outcomes, \r\nnot according to ideological content. Both consistent \r\nattention and responsive implementation are necessary \r\nto achieve long-term goals. We will put those ideas \r\nforward during the discussion.\r\nSince the urban centres of small States tend to have \r\ndisproportionately large social, political and economic \r\nweight in the country, a dysfunctional urban centre can \r\nhave a much greater negative effect on a small country \r\nthan on a big one. Today, slightly more than half of the \r\nworld’s population live in cities. By 2050, that will go \r\nup to 70 per cent. Most of that growth will take place \r\nin Africa, Asia and Latin America. As noted on page \r\n17 of the report of the High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda, cities \r\nare where the battle for sustainable development \r\nwill be won or lost. Mismanaged urbanization can \r\nintensify inequalities. Asia is already home to 61 per \r\ncent of the world’s slum dwellers, and Africa is home \r\nto about 26 per cent. The Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development has predicted that by \r\n2030, 2 billion people could live in urban poverty. They \r\nwill be at risk from overcrowding, epidemics, crime \r\nand pollution.\r\nYet, urbanization has in fact been significant \r\nin the progress towards achievement of the MDGs, \r\nespecially in reducing poverty. Successful cities bring \r\nup their rural hinterlands. Today, cities account for \r\nover 80 per cent of global gross domestic product. The \r\noutcome document of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nitself recognizes that well-planned cities promote \r\neconomically, socially and environmentally sustainable \r\nsocieties. They are engines for growth and are more \r\nresource-efficient than rural societies.\r\nMr. Gata Mavita wa Lufuta (Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe challenge is therefore really to manage \r\nurbanization well. Singapore has been contributing to the \r\ndiscussions on sustainable urbanization as co-chair of \r\nthe Group of Friends on Sustainable Cities. Singapore’s \r\nCentre for Liveable Cities was established in 2008 to \r\ndistil, create and share knowledge on sustainable cities. \r\nIt has developed a Liveability Framework as a tool to \r\nanalyse what a sustainable city would actually entail \r\nand help countries define the policies they need to \r\nachieve that goal. To us, a sustainable city means having \r\na competitive economy, environmental sustainability \r\nand a high quality of life for all inhabitants, rich and \r\npoor alike. We hope that the Liveability Framework can \r\nbe incorporated as part of discussions for the United \r\nNations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban \r\nDevelopment — Habitat III — in 2016.\r\nIn the area of water and sanitation, last year \r\nSingapore submitted resolution 67/291 to the General \r\nAssembly to designate 19 November as World Toilet \r\nDay in the context of Sanitation for All. This year, we \r\nwill observe that Day together with relevant United \r\nNations agencies and civil society organizations by \r\nfocusing on the serious problems faced by women and \r\ngirls who lack basic sanitation access. That issue needs \r\ngreater attention than it has received so far.\r\nWhat is the way forward? Once the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda has been agreed, countries will \r\nneed to consider implementation. South-South, North-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation in capacity-building \r\nand sharing experiences are important parts of the way \r\nforward. In our early years, Singapore benefited from \r\nthe expert advice of specialized agencies, international \r\norganizations and developed countries. In 1992, we set \r\nup the Singapore Cooperation Programme to share our \r\ndevelopment experience, the successes and the failures \r\nalike, with other developing countries. The Programme \r\nis designed to build capacity in fields that could \r\nbe of interest to countries, in the hope that that will \r\nsmooth their developmental path. Recently, at the third \r\nSmall Island Developing States Conference in Samoa, \r\nSingapore launched a dedicated package for SIDS.\r\nSingapore supports the universal and inclusive \r\napproach to the post-2015 development agenda. Each \r\nsociety must draw its own lessons from its own \r\nexperiences and find solutions according to its national \r\ncircumstances. Naturally, there will be differences of \r\nopinion, but we must not lose sight of the ultimate goal \r\nof ending extreme poverty in our lifetimes. With the \r\nMDGs, we managed to halve the number of people \r\nliving below the poverty line, and there is real hope \r\nthat we can do even better.\r\nLet us all work together to ensure that by the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the inception of the United \r\nNations, in 2015, we can unite around a clear vision \r\nof how to provide our future generations the future we \r\nwant.\r\n14-55187 11/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Charles Flanagan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of Ireland.\r\nMr. Flanagan (Ireland): It is my great honour \r\nto represent Ireland today at the General Assembly. \r\nRegrettably, this gathering comes at a dangerous time in \r\nglobal history. Delegates here represent a world facing \r\nmany challenges, but they are challenges that can be \r\ntackled with unity of purpose and surmounted through \r\nstrong leadership, especially from this Organization, \r\nthe United Nations. Indeed, the United Nations must be \r\nat the vanguard of efforts to eradicate terrorism where \r\nit f lourishes, to preserve the sovereignty of States \r\nwhere it is threatened and to promote and protect peace \r\nand human rights where those essential components of \r\nhuman dignity and human happiness are lacking.\r\nIn my address this afternoon, I will focus on \r\nthe conflicts that beset the Middle East and Eastern \r\nEurope, and I will do so in a way that reflects the \r\nforeign policy tenets of my country: first, dialogue \r\nand compromise as the solution to intractable conflicts \r\nbetween peoples; secondly, respect for the rule of law \r\nand solidarity within the international community \r\nwhen a democratic State is threatened; thirdly, a strong \r\ncommitment to peacekeeping while preserving Irish \r\nmilitary neutrality; fourthly, the critical importance of \r\ndevelopment; and last but not least, the promotion of \r\nhuman rights, in particular the rights of minorities and \r\nof women and girls in this troubled world.\r\nI will begin by outlining some thoughts on the \r\nimportance of reform of the United Nations and its \r\nSecurity Council. We see a world beset by warfare \r\nand terror on many fronts. Heart-rending reports of \r\nescalating casualty and refugee numbers, the slaughter \r\nof innocents, the suffering of children and vulnerable \r\nadults in Iraq, Syria, Gaza, Ukraine and many other \r\nconflicts dominate the news on our airwaves and \r\ntelevision news and on the Internet. The people we \r\nrepresent in the Assembly rightly expect the United \r\nNations to be a source of action. Regrettably, too \r\noften, they see an institution that seems hamstrung and \r\nstymied in situations where it needs to be both decisive \r\nand strong.\r\nIt is not that we lack the necessary instruments; the \r\nmany achievements of this great Organization amply \r\ndemonstrate its capacity to act decisively and effectively \r\nwhen the necessary political will is forthcoming. For \r\nthe United Nations to meet the manifold, complex \r\nand grave challenges that are dominating this year’s \r\nsession of the Assembly, the Organization must review \r\nits working methods and priorities. Resources must be \r\ndirected to the areas of greatest need and used with the \r\nutmost efficiency.\r\nIn particular, we must see new approaches to the \r\nwork of the Security Council — something Ireland \r\nand its partners in the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency Group have been actively promoting. \r\nWhile Ireland would like to see the veto power in the \r\nCouncil ultimately abolished, we strongly welcome \r\nthe initiative of France, supported by Mexico, to \r\nbetter regulate the use of that power by the Council’s \r\npermanent members. Moreover, Ireland supports an \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council to \r\nmore closely reflect regional balances as well as the \r\ncurrent realities of population and economic weight in \r\nthe world.\r\nThe challenge of achieving peace in the Middle East \r\nremains as great as ever. As Member States, we must do \r\nmore to assist the United Nations in its vital life-saving \r\nefforts in Syria and the many other humanitarian \r\nchallenges confronting the broader region. I want to \r\npay particular tribute here to the heroic role of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East and its brave and dedicated \r\nstaff in Gaza, 11 of whom tragically lost their lives \r\nduring the recent horrific conflict. We are all indebted \r\nto Pierre Krähenbühl and his colleagues for providing \r\nan indispensable lifeline to the people of Gaza over \r\nmany years.\r\nOur goal must be to ensure that there is no return to \r\nthe recurrent cycles of violence that we have witnessed \r\nin Gaza and southern Israel on three occasions now, \r\nmost devastatingly during July and August. Each cycle \r\nof violence appears to harden attitudes on both sides of \r\nthe conflict, and yet, ultimately, no one can want peace \r\nmore than those most directly affected by its absence.\r\nIt is widely acknowledged that the achievement of \r\na lasting peace requires that the underlying issues that \r\ngave rise to the most recent bout of violence must be \r\ndefinitively addressed. The closures and restrictions \r\nthat have applied to Gaza for seven long years now must \r\nbe brought to an end. Equally, there must be assurances \r\nfor all Israelis and Palestinians that they will not \r\nbe subjected to indiscriminate violence, whether \r\nthat violence comes in the form of rocket attacks \r\ntargeting Israel or retaliatory strikes with devastating \r\nconsequences for Gaza and its people.\r\n12/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nIt is also now long past time for the attainment \r\nof a comprehensive peace between the Israeli and \r\nPalestinian peoples. None of us is under any illusions \r\nabout the difficult and painful compromises that will \r\nbe involved. In essence, however, I believe that most \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians recognize that the only true \r\nbasis for peace and security between them lies in the \r\nrealization of a just, negotiated two-State solution. It \r\nremains vital that all actions or policies that impede \r\nthat prospect be avoided.\r\nWhile there is at least a clear vision of the difficult \r\ncompromises necessary to achieve a lasting peace \r\nbetween the peoples of Israel and Palestine, the situation \r\nin neighbouring Syria appears at the moment to present \r\nan even greater challenge. Over the past three and a \r\nhalf years, almost 200,000 people have lost their lives \r\nat the hands of the State and militant groups in that \r\nvicious conflict. Ultimately, the solution to Syria’s \r\ncivil war is not a military one. I strenuously urge all in \r\nthe international community to fully support Special \r\nEnvoy De Mistura in his efforts to promote a political \r\nsettlement based on the principles of the Geneva \r\ncommuniqué of 30 June 2012. The f lagrant violation of \r\ninternational law by all sides in the Syrian conflict must \r\nbe confronted and referred to the International Criminal \r\nCourt. All sides, particularly the Al-Assad regime, must \r\ncomply with their obligations under Security Council \r\nresolutions 2165 (2014) and 2139 (2014), and put an \r\nend to their obstruction of vital humanitarian efforts \r\nand to obscenities such as besieging communities and \r\nattempting to starve them into submission.\r\nThe growth of the extremism we are now witnessing \r\nacross the region is a cause for significant concern and \r\none that I know is shared by everyone in the Assembly. \r\nThe bloodlust and inhumanity that the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Sham (ISIS) is displaying in those countries \r\nhas shocked and appalled all civilized people. The \r\ndestruction and displacement of the ancient Christian \r\ncommunities of northern Iraq has been harrowing to \r\nwitness. The gratuitous and almost casual approach \r\nto that most gruesome form of murder, beheading; the \r\nbarbaric sexual violence perpetrated against women and \r\ngirls; the base corruptness of putting military weapons \r\nin the hands of children; the scapegoating of people \r\nbased on their ethnicity or religion, whether Christian, \r\nYazidi, Kurdish, Sunni, Shia or Jewish — all of that, \r\ntaken together, harks back to a mentality and a culture \r\nwe thought had long been consigned to the dustbin of \r\nhistory. The rise of ISIS, the continued activities of \r\nAl-Qaida and the growing strength of Boko Haram \r\nmake it clear that there is no room for complacency \r\nin the international community when it comes to the \r\ngrowth of extremism. We must unite and mobilize to \r\nconfront this threat, and we must do so with a real sense \r\nof urgency.\r\nUkraine is the most dangerous political crisis to \r\noccur in Europe for several decades. The situation \r\nthere has profound implications for the viability and \r\nfuture of an international system that upholds the rule \r\nof law. The actions of the Russian Federation, first in \r\nCrimea and then in eastern Ukraine, clearly contravene \r\na wide range of international agreements. We should \r\nremember first and foremost the deplorable violence \r\nthat has been inflicted on innocent civilians in Ukraine \r\nover many months and the serious humanitarian crisis \r\nthat has ensued. There can be no military solution to \r\nthis crisis. We firmly support the path of diplomatic \r\ndialogue and welcome President Poroshenko’s peace \r\nplan. We were encouraged by the Minsk agreement \r\nreached earlier this month within the framework of \r\nthe Trilateral Contact Group. A sustainable political \r\nsolution must be based on the principle of respect for \r\nUkraine’s sovereignty and with clear guarantees on \r\nborder security, the disarmament of all illegal groups \r\nand the withdrawal of foreign forces.\r\nIreland has a proud tradition of involvement in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions all over the \r\nworld, beginning in 1958. Our troops have made an \r\nimportant contribution to international peace and \r\nstability; 82 of them have made the ultimate sacrifice. I \r\ntake this opportunity to recall and salute all those who \r\nhave fallen in United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nsince we met for the general debate a year ago. Today, \r\nsome 370 Irish men and women are serving on United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions, the majority in the \r\nMiddle East. The environment in which they serve \r\nhas become increasingly complex and challenging. As \r\nit is for the Department for Peacekeeping Operations, \r\nthe safety and security of our personnel is a very high \r\npriority for us, and I warmly welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s announcement that there will be a review of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. That should ensure that \r\nthe Organization retains the capacity to promote peace \r\nand stability internationally.\r\nThe Assembly can rest assured that Irish men \r\nand women will continue to wear the blue beret with \r\npride in service of the United Nations and in pursuit \r\nof a better world. Last week, at the high-level meeting \r\non peacekeeping hosted by the Secretary-General and \r\n14-55187 13/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nVice-President Biden of the United States, I was pleased \r\nto announce an initiative by my Government to deliver \r\na new programme for training African peacekeepers \r\nthat will include a specific focus on areas such as the \r\nprotection of civilians, gender sensitivity, human rights, \r\nleadership training and logistics.\r\nThe full and equal participation of women is \r\nanother essential component in building peaceful, \r\nstable societies. Women are key agents of change \r\nand must be full protagonists in our ongoing global \r\nstory. Political will is a crucial element in driving \r\nwomen’s empowerment and gender equality going \r\nforward. Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) was \r\na milestone in recognizing that reality, and subsequent \r\nresolutions, most recently resolution 2122 (2013), \r\ndemonstrate our resolve to pursue the goal of women’s \r\nfull and empowered participation in the political \r\nprocess. The current agenda of the United Nations \r\nincludes a welcome and necessary increase in the focus \r\non tackling the scourge of sexual violence in armed \r\nconflict. \r\nBut we must translate our global commitment into \r\nconcrete action. Achieving real gender equality requires \r\na commitment from all of us here, men and women. It \r\nis a commitment that Ireland is proud to have made, \r\nand next January we launch our second national action \r\nplan on women, peace and security. It is just part of our \r\nongoing commitment to ensuring that women and girls \r\ncan reach their full potential, live a life free from fear \r\nand fully take their place at the decision-making table.\r\nThe global threat posed by the spread of Ebola in \r\nWest Africa is a reminder that not all the challenges we \r\nface are man-made. Ireland is active in addressing this \r\nepidemic in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Security Council \r\nresolution 2177 (2014), sponsored by 130 Member \r\nStates, indicates the seriousness with which the world \r\nregards the problem and the need for urgent action on \r\nthe part of the United Nations.\r\nNext year, 2015, will be a critical one in the \r\nfight to end extreme poverty and hunger. We have \r\n15 months to maximize progress under the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and a mere 12 in which to negotiate \r\na new framework for international development. That \r\nframework must mark an important shift to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, with clear and ambitious targets that can \r\nhelp to end extreme poverty, hunger and malnutrition in \r\na single generation. Ireland continues to play its part at \r\nthe United Nations and with our partners on the ground. \r\nWe have focused sharply on the continuing scandals of \r\nhunger, child stunting and maternal mortality in a world \r\nof plenty. I am pleased that last week the Human Rights \r\nCouncil adopted a draft resolution, led by Ireland, on \r\nthe preventable mortality and morbidity of children \r\nunder 5. It is indeed deplorable that some 6.6 million \r\nchildren under the age of 5 die annually, mainly from \r\npreventable and treatable causes.\r\nIreland is working with its partners in Africa on \r\nthe devastating impact of climate change, especially \r\non smallholder agriculture. Last week we joined the \r\nAlliance for Climate Smart Agriculture. On Thursday, I \r\nco-hosted a meeting here at the United Nations in support \r\nof the Secretary-General’s Zero Hunger Challenge. \r\nAnd days earlier, in Dublin, UNICEF Ireland brought \r\nto me the voices of Ireland’s young people, calling on \r\nus to strengthen our efforts and reminding me, in their \r\nwords, that “It’s about us”. Ireland’s commitment to \r\na more equal, inclusive and sustainable future for the \r\nworld’s children is demonstrated in practice through \r\nour development programme and our work with our \r\npartners in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite the extremely \r\ndifficult economic circumstances of recent years, we \r\nare proud that we have stabilized funding for our aid \r\nprogramme. The fight to end poverty and hunger will \r\nremain a central tenet of our foreign policy.\r\nRecent events worldwide have demonstrated that \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms continue to \r\nbe violated and threatened, particularly in times of \r\nconflict. In many parts of the world today, brave women \r\nand men seek to highlight and address abuses of human \r\nrights, and to stand up for those who are oppressed or \r\nwithout a voice. I salute the courage of those human \r\nrights defenders and pledge that we in Ireland will \r\ncontinue to work for decisive action, whether in the \r\nUnited Nations or the European Union, in order to \r\nsupport them. As a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ireland has sought to highlight the important \r\ncontribution of civil society to advancing human rights \r\nand building democratic societies.\r\nLast week, the Council adopted by consensus \r\nthe significant resolution 2178 (2014), led by Ireland, \r\ncalling on States to create and maintain a safe and \r\nenabling environment in which civil society can \r\noperate. We strongly condemn all forms of persecution \r\nand discrimination based on religion or belief. The \r\npersecution of Christians and other minorities in the \r\nMiddle East, and the recent rise of anti-Semitic attacks, \r\nparticularly in a number of European countries, are \r\ncauses of grave concern for me. Too often throughout \r\n14/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nhistory, the world has looked the other way when \r\nvulnerable minorities were being targeted, often as a \r\nprelude to a more serious conflict.\r\nOn a more positive note, as a former Minister for \r\nChildren and Youth Affairs in Ireland, I felt particularly \r\nhonoured last week to ratify the third Optional Protocol \r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child, reaffirming \r\nthe commitment of my Government to the protection \r\nand promotion of the rights of children in Ireland.\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that at its most effective this \r\ngreat Organization, the United Nations, is a force for \r\ngood in the world and has much untapped potential. The \r\nundoubted achievements in areas, such as peacekeeping, \r\nconflict resolution, development and humanitarian \r\naction, to which Ireland is proud to contribute, should \r\nrenew our faith in our collective ability and inspire us \r\nto meet the challenges that confront us now and many \r\nof those that will lie ahead in the future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. Luis Almagro, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Almagro (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Ours \r\nis a harsh and difficult world — a complex, sometimes \r\ndisgraceful world where 6 million children die each \r\nyear before their fifth birthday, many from problems \r\nrelated to malnutrition; where violence has taken on a \r\nnew dimension of terror and horror, with hundreds of \r\nthousands of deaths in Libya, Syria and Iraq; and where \r\nhuman rights violations and crimes against humanity \r\noccur more frequently and with greater ferocity and are \r\nthe daily reality in those countries.\r\nIt is a world where more than 8 million people \r\ndie every year from tobacco consumption — an \r\nincredible genocidal activity that cannot be stopped \r\nand is promoted by markets that are increasingly more \r\nopen, free, less regulated, and licensed to operate in \r\ncontravention of people’s rights to life and health. It is \r\na world where military bombs strike and kill those in \r\nschools, ethnic or religious minorities, or those who \r\nmay adhere to different political beliefs. It is a world \r\nwhere natural disasters devastate countries one year \r\nand again the following year and the next, as they have \r\nin the brotherly countries of the Caribbean. In this \r\nworld, those who act as global police have bequeathed \r\nsocial and political disasters wherever they have gone. \r\nGlobal governance has been inspired not by rights, but \r\nby interests. Those narrow interests were paid for with \r\npeople’s lives, human rights violations and migration, \r\nin which people have had to leave their homes, cities \r\nand countries, vulnerable and facing anguish, violence \r\nand death again and again. \r\nThe United Nations has been unable to build a \r\nsystem to find solutions, and it has failed fundamentally \r\nin its ethical dimension. There has been no dearth of \r\nwork, documents or meetings, but there has been a lack \r\nof solutions for people. Our shared ethics should be \r\nbased on the people. Our shared ethical structure in this \r\ncase must be capable of incorporating our diversity, to \r\nfree us with democracy and participation. We need to \r\ngrow and develop multilateralism, which is the only \r\npath and basic instrument to promote that shared \r\nethical structure, ensuring ever more rights for ever \r\nmore people. We need to grow and develop in freedom.\r\nThe political and financial crises of this world are \r\nlinked to common values and ethical standards. Today’s \r\nworld is one of sheer confusion in which humanitarian \r\ncrises follow upon political crises, which in turn follow \r\nupon financial, economic and social crises. Here in \r\nthis building we have our own microclimate; we wear \r\nelegant suits, eat in expensive restaurants and drive \r\nlarge, modern cars. What happens to people who are \r\nnot insiders but who suffer in refugee camps where \r\ntheir families are killed, their villages are destroyed \r\nand they are tortured, or where their environments are \r\ndestroyed by the effects of climate change? No one who \r\nhas gained a right should lose it the next day; we need to \r\nprotect that right. We need to offer better opportunities.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals have served \r\nas a useful tool to foster and channel efforts for specific \r\npurposes, but we should not leave countries alone in \r\nthose efforts. Within that framework, we should step up \r\nour efforts every year and seek to define more clearly \r\nthe sustainable development goals that will make up \r\nthe post-2015 sustainable development agenda in a \r\nbalanced, transparent and consensual way that envisions \r\nintegration of the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment: social, economic and environmental.\r\nWe should eliminate poverty from the perspective \r\nof human rights and the recognition of those rights. The \r\nwealth that comes into the world causes an increase in \r\nthe gross domestic product and exports and creates \r\nmore dynamic investment, all of which must be \r\naccompanied by a logical recognition of rights. We are \r\nmore developed and richer when we have more rights to \r\nexercise, when those rights are protected, and when we \r\nhave more guarantees against the growing inequalities \r\nin the world. Poverty is experienced at many levels, \r\n14-55187 15/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nand each country is responsible for granting ever more \r\nrights to help its people overcome poverty, improve \r\nconditions and eliminate discrimination. \r\nAll efforts are valuable in every one of our countries, \r\nand as is every non-governmental organization that \r\ncharts the way or denounces an abuse of human rights \r\nor seeks to improve opportunities for women, children, \r\nyouths, retired people and migrants in different areas, \r\nsuch as health care, education, social protection, decent \r\nwork, social and economic opportunities, whether they \r\nare employed as rural or domestic workers. In every \r\nindividual there is an enormous potential that needs to \r\nbe protected and fostered. \r\nThe gender perspective that we need to promote \r\nshould also be aligned with key rights for every \r\nindividual who may suffer from even a little bit of \r\ndiscrimination in this world. The women’s agenda is one \r\nof the most powerful vectors for development that we \r\ncan design. Any type of discrimination involves some \r\nform of underdevelopment, because discrimination \r\nbased on gender, ethnicity, religion, disability, sexual \r\norientation or migratory status is contrary to what our \r\nsocieties need. \r\nOur societies must be more inclusive. Our \r\nsocieties should incorporate every single one of those \r\nrights into our political system and legal protections, \r\nwhether they relate to the right of same-sex marriage, \r\nthe right of those who cohabit, or the rights of those \r\nwith HIV. It is essential to fight for equality and to \r\neliminate discrimination based on sexual orientation or \r\ngender identity. All rights are part of the best social \r\nstructure — love. Love is the essential factor that \r\neliminates inequality and discrimination, that makes us \r\nall equal and that allows us to identify with our fellow \r\nhuman beings.\r\nThe comprehensive human rights agenda must \r\nbe based on an increasing number of rights for an \r\nincreasing number of people so that everyone is able \r\nto grow in freedom and equality. We need to continue \r\nto make definitive progress on social topics such as \r\ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases. That \r\nincludes those related to tobacco consumption, from \r\nwhich, as I mentioned, over 8 million people die every \r\nyear. It is expected that that figure will continue to rise. \r\nIt is therefore crucial that we have national policies that \r\nfocus on healthy lifestyles.\r\nIn 2013, Uruguay legalized the sale of cannabis, \r\nchoosing an alternative regulatory model to combat drug \r\ntrafficking and its disastrous consequences in society. \r\nWe do not claim to be an example or a trailblazer, but \r\nwe do, obviously, want to redesign the kinds of policies \r\nthat have categorically failed to date and that have not \r\nproduced the expected results.\r\nThe critical situation in the world today with \r\nrespect to food security is a structural problem. It is \r\nthe result of bad global policies. One of every eight \r\npeople, many of them children, suffer from chronic \r\nmalnutrition. Humankind wastes more than a third of \r\nall the food we produce, which would be enough to \r\nresolve the problem of hunger. It is estimated that 30 \r\nto 50 per cent of the food produced every year is never \r\nconsumed by people, and the situation is worsening due \r\nto soil erosion, growing water scarcity, climate change \r\nand the improper use of toxic substances in the food \r\nproduction chain.\r\nCombating climate change is a top priority. The \r\nneed to implement policies today and not put them \r\noff until tomorrow is the moral imperative of every \r\nsingle individual in this Hall, so that we can give \r\nconcrete content to the sustainable development goals \r\nand continue to grow. It is also important to continue \r\nto develop civil and political society, which we must \r\nsupport. The principle of the legal equality of States is \r\nessential. That is why my country rejects, for example, \r\nany coercive, unilateral or extraterritorial measures \r\nthat contravene the norms of international law and the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nclearest example of that is the unjust blockade imposed \r\nagainst Cuba. We would like to once again express \r\nour strongest rejection of it. Uruguay would like to \r\nunequivocally demand that Cuba be stricken from the \r\nlist of countries who harbour terrorists.\r\nIn the same vein, Uruguay would like to call for an \r\nend to be put to financial speculation by vulture funds. \r\nIt is important that countries be able to restructure \r\ntheir sovereign debt in predictable, unchanging and just \r\nconditions without impacting development and, thus, \r\nthe well-being of their people.\r\nGlobal peace and security are essential. The \r\neradication of any form of violence in this world is a \r\ncrucial issue. It is essential to have negotiated solutions \r\nthat parties agree on, and contributions by peacekeeping \r\nmissions are essential to providing maximal guarantees \r\nin the world.\r\nHuman rights should be fully respected. They \r\nshould be fully monitored, and guarantees should \r\n16/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nbe provided in that regard to every individual. The \r\nauthorities should ensure that human rights are fully \r\nmonitored to ensure that their people enjoy the broadest \r\npossible freedoms.\r\nUruguay deplores violence in all its forms. The \r\nsubstance of violence is bad at its core. There is no \r\njustification for violence to continue to spread in the \r\nworld today. Every time one right is undermined, it \r\nis our responsibility, as those who govern, to lead \r\nthe fight for its restoration. Every time justice is not \r\nrendered, it must be our mission, as leaders, to demand \r\naccountability. Every time we recognize a new right, \r\nit is our obligation to remember those who still cannot \r\nexercise that right and to work tirelessly for their \r\nbenefit.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. José Badia, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nMr. Badia (Monaco) (spoke in French): The lofty \r\naspirations of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nguided our first steps into the era of the second \r\nmillennium and enabled us to realize, in part, the \r\npriorities that we hold so dear. With this shared \r\nexperience, which is extraordinary in terms of what it \r\nhas made concrete, and aware of the new challenges \r\nthat have been imposed on us over the past 15 years, \r\nwe now have clear lessons on which to build the future \r\nwe want. We now know that peace and development are \r\ninseparable.\r\nThe future to which we all aspire can be understood \r\non three levels, based on the three pillars of sustainable \r\ndevelopment that command our attention equally. The \r\nwork we have started on defining the post-2015 era, \r\nby its very nature and given the challenges it poses, \r\nmerits committed efforts by the entire international \r\ncommunity, which have already been undertaken. \r\nIndeed, it requires a contribution by all States and all \r\nparts of society, including the private sector, academia, \r\nphilanthropy and, obviously, non-governmental \r\norganizations. It also must be, as a matter of ethics but \r\nalso to ensure its viability, inclusive, participatory and \r\nbased on good governance.\r\nThose are therefore the bases for defining the post-\r\n2015 era, despite the glaring paradoxes and the many \r\nobstacles we unfortunately face. At a time when the \r\nworld is highly interdependent, its communications \r\ntechnology performing as never before and its riches \r\nabundant, inequalities continue to grow, and too many \r\nof us remain marginalized and live in unacceptable \r\nconditions.\r\nInevitable climate change, which is recognized as \r\nthe greatest challenge of our time, will decide the fate of \r\nour planet and darkens our future prospects by already \r\nthreatening our present. Conflicts persist, while others \r\nare born, and terrorist acts lead to a range of problems \r\nthat challenge traditional defence strategies. This past \r\nyear, existing and new conflicts have escalated towards \r\nan unacceptable level. The Monegasque authorities can \r\nonly reiterate their commitment to the values  of the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and join the efforts of those who seek a peaceful \r\nand political settlement of the crisis in Ukraine.\r\nThe use of chemical weapons in Syria and the assault \r\non civilian targets in Syria, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, South \r\nSudan, Mali, the Central African Republic and Nigeria \r\nhave spread horror and are barbarous practices. They \r\nare intolerable. That is why the Government of Monaco \r\ncondemned acts of abject violence by supporting the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) last \r\nweek, which establishes a new legislative and policy \r\nframework to coordinate international efforts to fight \r\nagainst the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters.\r\nThe Principality shares the grief of the French, \r\nBritish and American peoples following the heinous \r\nkillings of their nationals who were held hostage. In \r\nmemory of those victims, His Serene Highness Prince \r\nAlbert II asked that f lags at administrative buildings and \r\nMonegasque public institutions be f lown at half-mast. \r\nThose who commit such heinous crimes in the name \r\nof a religion they blaspheme annihilate the foundation \r\nof our society by violating the rule of law and respect \r\nfor the standards that we have developed together. They \r\nuse communications networks and social networks, \r\nwhich we might think would be used to spread harmony \r\nand unity, to spread hatred and chaos. We have reason \r\nto wonder about their motivations and the reasons that \r\nmake their appeal so convincing.\r\nThe response is obviously rooted in exclusion and \r\nthe marginalization of people who have not yet benefited \r\nfrom what we call progress. It often involves young \r\npeople without prospects for the future. Therefore, \r\nit is our responsibility to design inclusive social \r\nintegration policies, promoting education and youth \r\nemployment. Young people have never formed such a \r\nlarge proportion of the world population — particularly \r\nin developing countries. They must be an integral part \r\n14-55187 17/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nof the decision-making process in order to allow them \r\nto realize their human potential.\r\nWe welcome, in that respect, the “Rights Up \r\nFront” initiative of the Secretary-General, launched in \r\nNovember 2013, whose primary objective is to make \r\nsure that human rights violations do not become mass \r\ncrimes and to enable the Organization to act more \r\nquickly by placing people at the heart of its strategies \r\nand operational activities.\r\nOn the eve of the tenth anniversary of the 2005 \r\nSummit, and especially as memories of sinister \r\ngenocides come to mind, we must do a better job of \r\npromoting the responsibility to protect. That is the \r\nprimary responsibility of every State, as we know, but \r\nwe also need to be able to help States for which capacity-\r\nbuilding is difficult. Prevention remains a fundamental \r\naspect of our Organization’s work. In that regard, the \r\ninvolvement of regional and subregional organizations \r\nis essential to the effective implementation of the \r\nprotection of populations from genocide, war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity. The promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights must be at the heart of our \r\npolicies. Prince Al-Hussein has our full confidence. \r\nWith his experience and his unwavering commitment \r\nto peace and the rule of law, he can be the right United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights for our \r\ntimes.\r\nAnother aspect also deserves emphasis — the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance in conflict zones. \r\nIt must not depend on the political context. The \r\npoliticization of humanitarian assistance should be \r\na priority item for discussion at the global summit in \r\n2016.\r\nIn the light of the increasing number and persistence \r\nof crisis areas, caused both by conflicts and by natural \r\ndisasters, whose frequency we now associate with the \r\nrate of climate change, we must take into consideration \r\nthe needs of over 50 million people. The magnitude of \r\nthose needs justifies the new partnerships that have \r\nbeen formed around organizations, local partners and \r\nthe private sector and individuals.\r\nThe unprecedented threat of the Ebola virus in West \r\nAfrica is testing our ability to respond in an effective \r\nand coordinated manner. We support the establishment \r\nby the Secretary-General of the United Nations \r\nMission for Ebola Emergency Response to counter the \r\nlarge-scale threat Ebola poses to international peace \r\nand security. In that regard, I wish to acknowledge the \r\ncommitment of the Principality of Monaco, which is \r\neffectively contributing to that unprecedented struggle, \r\ntogether with the World Health Organization and the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross. We share in \r\nthe grief of the victims and that of their families. We \r\nare aware that the families’ tragedies are compounded \r\nand their pain is made  unbearable by the fact that they \r\nare unable to take care of their loved ones or provide \r\nproper funerals for those who die.\r\nIn these difficult times, we need to establish a new \r\npost-2015 sustainable development paradigm. Universal, \r\ninclusive, ambitious and concrete, it must accommodate \r\nthe pressures of a growing global population and the \r\nurbanization that comes with it. It requires us to adapt \r\nour methods of production, consumption and transport \r\nand to opt for clean technologies. We need to define the \r\nnature of the world we want to live in, with and for our \r\nchildren. As I mentioned earlier, it is vital that the needs \r\nof the most vulnerable be duly taken into consideration \r\nand that economic independence for women and young \r\npeople be ensured. It is time for women to realize the \r\ntransformation that the Secretary-General announced \r\nby breaking through the glass ceiling that for too long \r\nhas kept them from achieving their potential. Without \r\nthe full contribution of those who constitute 50 per cent \r\nof humankind, sustainable development will not be \r\nachieved.\r\nThe year 2015 will also mark the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and security. \r\nWe reiterate our call to end impunity for crimes related \r\nto sexual and gender-based violence against women, as \r\nwell as all the abuse women suffer.\r\nThe undeniable success of the Climate Summit should \r\nbe measured not only by the commitments announced, \r\nbut also by the broad participation of the private sector, \r\nfoundations and civil society and by the sense of \r\nownership expressed by all the stakeholders concerned. \r\nThe Summit therefore succeeded in catalysing society \r\nas a whole, thus ensuring that the political momentum \r\nwill be maintained in Lima and Paris. As the issue of \r\nclimate change cannot be separated from the question \r\nof the oceans, the Prince’s Government will continue \r\nto defend an objective of sustainable development \r\ndedicated to healthy and productive oceans for all. The \r\nAssembly may rest assured that Monaco will engage in \r\ndiscussions, which will begin in January, and we will \r\ncontinue, in both national and international policies, to \r\nact as a responsible and unifying partner.\r\n18/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Samura Kamara, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra \r\nLeone.\r\nMr. Kamara (Sierra Leone): I bring to the \r\nAssembly fraternal greetings and best wishes from \r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone, and his beleaguered people. President \r\nKoroma deeply regrets that, for obvious reasons, he is \r\nunable to participate in the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. He has, however, instructed me to \r\ndeliver to the Assembly this message from him:\r\n“I congratulate the President on being elected \r\nto conduct the affairs of the sixty-ninth session of \r\nthe Assembly and assure him of the support and \r\ncooperation of my country, Sierra Leone, during \r\nhis tenure. To his predecessor, Ambassador John \r\nAshe of Antigua and Barbuda, let me, on behalf \r\nof my Government and people, express our \r\nappreciation for his astute leadership and skill in \r\nsmoothly directing the work of the past session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\n“My sincere thanks and appreciation go to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his constructive \r\nand dynamic leadership of the Organization. Sierra \r\nLeone deeply appreciates his forward-looking and \r\nlaudable initiatives on the issues of sustainable \r\nenergy and climate change, among others. In \r\nparticular, I appreciate his robust response to the \r\nEbola epidemic that is causing so much havoc in \r\nour lives and threatening our dignity and our very \r\nexistence. We will continue to support those highly \r\nambitious and commendable initiatives for a better \r\nand safer world.\r\n“Sierra Leone commends the President on \r\nthe choice, appropriateness and sense of urgency \r\nof the theme of the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and we join him in calling \r\nfor a structured dialogue, strengthened global \r\npartnership and enhanced cooperation for its \r\nachievement. Sierra Leone wishes to reiterate the \r\nneed to generate the required global political will \r\nto address unfinished business in the context of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by \r\nfocusing on implementation gaps and new and \r\nemerging challenges. As Chair of the small Group \r\nof Seven Plus States, Sierra Leone reaffirms the \r\ncall of this group of fragile and post-conflict States \r\nfor the support of goal 16 of the outcome document \r\nof the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Goal 16 is one of 17 priorities \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda and envisages \r\npromoting peaceful and inclusive institutions as a \r\nstand-alone aim.\r\n“My country is battling one of the biggest life-or-\r\ndeath challenges facing the global community. As \r\nI stated in my address to the Secretary-General’s \r\nhigh-level meeting on response to the Ebola virus \r\ndisease outbreak, Ebola is unlike previous threats, \r\nnot because something similar has never occurred \r\nbefore, but because the Ebola outbreak has mutated \r\ninto a phenomenon for which my country, my \r\nregion and the global community were grossly ill-\r\nprepared. Isolated communities are becoming less \r\nfrequent in our globalized world. Mutating viral \r\ndiseases like Ebola can no longer be neatly isolated \r\nsimply by sealing off a country in a corner of the \r\nworld. The Ebola outbreak in our region provides \r\nthe first challenge to infrastructure, human capital \r\nand public health and surveillance systems that \r\nare too weak to deal with the faster occurrences \r\nof animal-to-human, and human-to-human \r\ntransmissions of highly contagious diseases that \r\nhave been made possible by quicker transportation, \r\nincreasing urbanization and dense networks of \r\npeople moving between rural and urban areas and \r\nacross borders.\r\n“We have been slow to meet this new challenge \r\nbecause no one recognized that this confluence of \r\ntrends could emerge with such virulence in West \r\nAfrica. Our international partners were slow to \r\nrecognize the threat for what it was, and when \r\nrecognition did come, it was accompanied by a \r\nspontaneous reaction of fear and panic that led to \r\nthe closure of borders and the imposition of travel \r\nrestrictions to and from Sierra Leone and our \r\nsubregion.\r\n“This is the very first time Ebola has come to \r\nour region and to my country, Sierra Leone. We \r\ndid not bring it on ourselves. We are rebuilding \r\nour infrastructure, implementing policies that \r\nwere increasing our growth rates, improving our \r\nhealth-care and literacy indicators, enhancing \r\nour peace, and strengthening our democracy. \r\nWe are contributing troops to the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations in other lands, as our share \r\nof the peace dividend. The world was lauding us for \r\ndoing so many things right, for being a symbol of \r\n14-55187 19/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nfast-paced recovery from a decade-long devastating \r\ncivil conflict, for promoting and protecting human \r\nrights, and for advancing along an impressive path \r\nof socioeconomic reconstruction. We were gearing \r\nup our health-care system to fight the known \r\nailments of our land, such as malaria, maternal \r\nand infant mortality, Lassa fever, tuberculosis \r\nand typhoid, when Ebola struck. Based on the \r\nknowledge we had, based on the advice we were \r\ngiven by our international partners, we mobilized \r\nto meet this unfamiliar threat. But the staff, \r\nequipment, medicines and systems we had were \r\ninadequate, and this slowed our effective response.\r\n“Several months down the road, the \r\ninternational community has finally come around \r\nto the view that the Ebola outbreak is a challenge \r\nfor everyone, and that, while Sierra Leone and its \r\nsister republics are at the front line of this fight, \r\nthe heavy aerial and ground support of the world \r\nare required to defeat the outbreak, for Ebola is \r\nin many ways worse than terrorism. As a country, \r\nwe have taken extraordinary measures, including \r\ndeclaring a state of emergency and shutting down \r\nthe country for three days to get health educators \r\ninto every household in the country. Today, most of \r\nour people know that Ebola may present with the \r\nsame signs as malaria, typhoid, diarrhoea and other \r\ninfectious diseases, but that it is far more deadly, \r\nand that there is a need to modify behaviour in \r\norder to counter its transmission.\r\n“Socioeconomic disruptions are already being \r\nfelt. We are no longer able to engage in our cultural \r\npractices, such as shaking hands when we gladly \r\nreceive each other, or hold religious and communal \r\nburial ceremonies. Our people live in fear and \r\ncannot understand the nature of a disease that \r\nclaims lives and prevents family members from \r\nburying their loved ones.\r\n“The indeterminate suspension of several \r\nongoing development projects, and the disruption \r\nto farming, mining, manufacturing, construction, \r\ntourism, trading and public transportation, following \r\nthe outbreak of Ebola, are now undermining the \r\ngrowth and human development prospects of the \r\ncountry. The International Monetary Fund has \r\nestimated that our gross domestic product will \r\ndrop by 3.3 per cent in 2014 from 11.3 per cent to \r\n8 per cent. Ebola has placed a stranglehold on the \r\nsocioeconomic prospects of the country, and, in \r\naddition, we risk reversing the hard gains achieved \r\nin peacebuilding.\r\n“We salute the great efforts of countries, as \r\nwell as international and national organizations, \r\nthat have committed resources to our common \r\nfight. We welcome the adoption of the landmark \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2177 (2014) and its \r\nGeneral Assembly counterpart, resolution 69/1, \r\nboth of which recognize the Ebola outbreak as a \r\nthreat to international peace and security. We \r\nalso salute the Secretary-General for his initiative \r\nin establishing the first-ever United Nations \r\nemergency health mission, the United Nations \r\nMission for Ebola Emergency Response, to lead \r\na concerted and coordinated effort to contain and \r\ndefeat this scourge within the subregion.\r\n“We know that to defeat the disease and \r\nprevent future outbreaks anywhere in the world, we \r\nmust improve our capacities for quicker response. \r\nIn Sierra Leone, this calls for faster deployment of \r\nstaff, medicines and equipment at the global and \r\nnational levels. Globally, a faster response means \r\nquickening the pace of resource mobilization \r\nand disbursements, as well as the development of \r\nvaccines and curative medicines. Nationally, our \r\neffort must rapidly translate into effective urban \r\nand rural community response initiatives. Any \r\nbreak in this chain of fast response makes the \r\nchallenge more difficult to meet, and not meeting \r\nthe challenge means more deaths in our country and \r\nthe increased possibility that the virus will mutate \r\nand spread to areas from which it is currently \r\nabsent.\r\n“The world needs a faster global response \r\ninfrastructure to deal with this new trend that \r\nis today manifesting itself in the West African \r\nnations of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, but to \r\nwhich no country can be immune. Ebola is winning \r\nthe race against us. To make an impactful start in \r\nreversing this trend, we must have more treatment \r\nbeds than there are Ebola cases. Only when the \r\nnumber of available beds surpasses the number of \r\ncases can we say that Ebola has been brought under \r\ncontrol. This is a fight for all of us. We must prove \r\nthat humankind is equal to overcoming this new \r\nchallenge to our collective existence.\r\n“We also believe that it is high time for this \r\nAssembly to make its voice heard regarding the \r\nf light bans and cancellations that have accompanied \r\n20/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nthe deadly Ebola outbreak. The World Health \r\nOrganization and many others have advised against \r\nimposing blanket f light bans. We therefore urge \r\nMember States to re-examine their policies of \r\nisolating and stigmatizing Ebola-affected countries \r\nand their respective citizens. The world is too \r\nglobalized for policies that shun engagement with a \r\ndemocratic nation. The United Nations was founded \r\non a mandate to confront human insecurity, not \r\nshun it. Moreover, this Organization was founded \r\non the principle of doing better than before. We \r\nstrongly urge loyalty to the founding ideals of our \r\nglobal Organization.\r\n“Despite the daunting challenge facing us as \r\na nation and subregion, Sierra Leone will remain \r\na trusted and strategic partner in the global effort \r\nto eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable \r\npeace, stability and development. My Government \r\nis committed to forging closer bonds with all \r\ncountries, especially within the context of the New \r\nDeal for Engagement in Fragile States.\r\n“As Coordinator of the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten Heads of State on the Reform of \r\nthe United Nations, we will continue to advance the \r\nAfrican Common Position on the reform process of \r\nthe United Nations by reaching out and engaging \r\nwith other interest groups in a bid to reach a common \r\nunderstanding of how to obtain a strong, inclusive, \r\nunited, transparent and accountable Security \r\nCouncil. While the world now acknowledges the \r\nhistorical injustice represented by the fact that \r\nAfrica is the only continent not represented in \r\nthe permanent category of Council membership \r\nand, at the same time, is underrepresented in the \r\nnon-permanent category, it is about time for this \r\nOrganization to take the necessary bold steps to put \r\ninto practice our reaffirmation of the equal rights \r\nof nations, large and small. Indeed, as we gear up \r\nto celebrate 70 memorable years of the existence \r\nof the United Nations, it is an appropriate time \r\nfor the Organization to promote the principle of \r\nthe sovereign equality of all its Members and to \r\nensure for all the rights and benefits resulting from \r\nmembership.\r\n“We are encouraged by the progress made in \r\nstrengthening peace and democracy within member \r\ncountries of the Mano River Union, and we shall \r\ncontinue to support initiatives for the sustenance \r\nand growth of democratic order, peace and security \r\nin the subregion. We will continue to adhere to \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS) protocols for peace, democracy and \r\nstability and will sustain our support for the \r\nbuilding of the ECOWAS logistical depot in Sierra \r\nLeone. We firmly support the African Union \r\nrapid intervention initiative for peacekeeping and \r\npeace-support operations. We have also ratified \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty and the Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime and the Protocols \r\nthereto. We are currently working to incorporate \r\nthem into our domestic law.\r\n“My Government will continue to contribute \r\ntroops and support international peacekeeping \r\noperations for international peace and security, and \r\nwe will accordingly seek capacity-building and \r\nother support in such laudable ventures. We are, \r\nhowever, dismayed by the current trend of events \r\nin South Sudan, the Central African Republic, the \r\nGaza Strip, Syria, Ukraine, Iraq and other parts of \r\nthe world that are still in conflict. We will commit \r\nSierra Leone to the global search for common \r\nagreement on the root causes of those conflicts \r\nand encourage dialogue to work out resolutions \r\nthat are peaceful and sustainable. We support the \r\ntwo independent States solution in the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict.\r\n“Sierra Leone condemns any act of terrorism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations in the world \r\nin general and in Africa in particular. Terrorism \r\nis a common enemy to international peace and \r\nsecurity. Sierra Leone prides itself on its high level \r\nof religious tolerance, and we believe that people of \r\nall religions and ethnic backgrounds must be able \r\nto coexist in peace and harmony everywhere in the \r\nworld. We likewise view acts of drug trafficking, \r\nhuman trafficking, smuggling of migrants, \r\nmarine piracy, cybercrime, abductions and all \r\nother organized or unorganized transnational \r\ncriminal activities as serious threats to global \r\npeace, stability and development. My Government \r\nwill strengthen national capacities and contribute \r\nthrough international cooperation to preventing \r\nand combating those crimes.\r\n“As a post-conflict country, we are aware \r\nthat sexual violence in conflict is one of the \r\ngreatest and most persistent injustices in the world \r\ntoday. We are therefore supportive of the United \r\nKingdom’s Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative \r\n14-55187 21/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nand the subsequent Declaration of Commitment to \r\nEnd Sexual Violence in Conflict. We support the \r\nwork of the Office of the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence \r\nin Conflict. We also fully support the United \r\nKingdom Government’s leadership in promoting \r\nglobal advocacy against the use of children in \r\narmed conflicts.\r\n“We are following the unfolding developments at \r\nthe International Criminal Court and are supportive \r\nof the efforts to ensure judicial accountability in \r\nways that are respectful of Africa’s concerns for \r\nthe ability of its statesmen and stateswomen to \r\nsteer the countries of the continent towards greater \r\nsecurity, reconciliation, peace and development.\r\n“My Government will continue to support \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council. We are \r\ncommitted to the moratorium on the death penalty \r\nand have gone a step further in the process of \r\ncommuting capital offences to life imprisonment in \r\nour statute books.\r\n“In conclusion, while applauding the \r\ninternational community for supporting our \r\naspirations, we wish to remind the world that \r\nfighting the Ebola virus disease in West Africa \r\nis a matter of life and death for the whole of \r\nhumankind. The World Health Organization \r\nfinally got it right when it declared the outbreak \r\nas a global health emergency, but an emergency \r\nrequires a response faster than what is currently \r\nobtaining. We can defeat Ebola and, as already \r\nnoted by experts, future outbreaks of diseases \r\nof that nature anywhere in the world can also be \r\ndefeated by quickening the pace of response. Our \r\nunderstanding of that unprecedented outbreak is \r\nbetter now than at the beginning, and our response \r\nhas improved accordingly. While our capacities are \r\ngetting better coordinated, there is still room for \r\nstrengthening those capacities to ensure effective \r\nnational ownership and leadership of all response \r\nmechanisms. Undoubtedly, we can do better than \r\nwhat obtained at the beginning of the outbreak, and \r\nwe must do all we can to end such a grave threat \r\nto our collective survival. We will also continue \r\nour engagement with all stakeholders to build our \r\npublic health system beyond Ebola.\r\n“On the occasion of the sixty-ninth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, let me reiterate our deepest \r\ncondolences to the families and relatives of all our \r\nbrave men, women and children who have lost their \r\nlives to the Ebola virus disease. May the Father \r\nmost high receive their souls and the souls of all \r\nfaithful departed into his merciful hands.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Augustine Kpehe Ngafuan, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nMr. Ngafuan (Liberia): I bring the Assembly \r\ngreetings from Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen \r\nJohnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, \r\nwho should have been here today to address the \r\nAssembly but chose to remain on the front lines in \r\nLiberia to lead our fight against the deadly Ebola virus \r\ndisease.\r\nLiberia congratulates the President of the Assembly \r\non his assumption of his high office and acknowledges \r\nthe astute statesmanship and wisdom that he brings to \r\nthat important assignment, which inspire confidence \r\nfor a successful sixty-ninth session of the Assembly. We \r\nassure him of Liberia’s full cooperation and support. \r\nWe pay a special tribute to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his able and visionary stewardship of the \r\naffairs of this global institution.\r\nWith just one year until the expiration date of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the theme \r\nof this sixty-ninth general debate, “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”, could not have been more appropriate. Liberia \r\nwas put on the pedestal of global honour when President \r\nJohnson-Sirleaf was selected as one of three co-chairs \r\nof the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda, formed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in 2012 to advise him on the contours of an \r\nambitious but realistic post-2015 global development \r\nagenda and to define the critical steps required to \r\nreinvigorate and sustain global partnership. The Panel’s \r\nreport, A New Global Partnership: Eradicate Poverty and \r\nTransform Economies through Sustainable Development, \r\ncontained a clarion call to leave no one behind, which \r\nhas been embraced as a motivating theme by many.\r\nAt the continental level, our President chairs a \r\n10-member high-level committee of African Heads \r\nof State, under whose leadership a African Common \r\nPosition has been developed and endorsed by the \r\nmembership of the African Union (AU). That Position \r\nis based on six pillars that represent Africa’s vision \r\nof the prerequisites for eradicating poverty on the \r\ncontinent and for ensuring its future and development. \r\n22/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nWe are encouraged that the concepts and strategies \r\ndefined under each of the pillars have been significantly \r\nincorporated into the proposed 17 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. That makes us optimistic that the \r\nsubstance of our pillars will form an integral part of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. As we await the \r\nSecretary-General’s synthesizing report, I can assure \r\nthe Assembly of Liberia’s continued active participation \r\nin the negotiations that lie ahead.\r\nAs we survey the regional and international \r\npolitical landscape, we are increasingly concerned \r\nabout the spread of extremist ideologies and terrorist \r\nactivities around the world, especially in Africa. \r\nWhether we are speaking of Al-Shabaab in Somalia \r\nand Kenya, Al-Qaida in the Maghreb or Boko Haram \r\nin Nigeria, the African continent has not been spared \r\nthe deadly and destructive consequences of extremism. \r\nAdditionally, over the past year, while peace processes \r\nwere being consolidated in many African countries, we \r\nhave been sad witnesses to the eruption or exacerbation \r\nof conflicts on the continent, notably in South Sudan \r\nand the Central African Republic. We laud the efforts \r\nof the AU and the United Nations to resolve those \r\nconflicts, and join in the call for sustained international \r\naction to bring about a more secure and peaceful world.\r\nLiberia commends the Secretary-General for his \r\nconvening, last week, of the high-level Climate Summit, \r\nwhich elicited concrete commitments from the global \r\ncommunity on reducing greenhouse emissions and other \r\nmeasures aimed at achieving sustainable development. \r\nAs a small country and one that is still endowed with \r\n43 per cent of the remaining Guinea forests, we are proud \r\nthat we too have concluded partnership agreements and \r\nmade concrete commitments aimed at supporting the \r\ngoals of sustainable, climate-sensitive development. \r\nSmall countries like Liberia contribute less to \r\ngreenhouse emissions but suffer disproportionately \r\nfrom the adverse impact of climate change. To right that \r\nanomaly and in the united spirit of saving our one world, \r\nall countries, big and small, should make proportionate \r\ncommitments to saving our planet and take concrete \r\naction to make such commitments a reality.\r\nA year ago, when President Johnson-Sirleaf \r\naddressed the Assembly (see A/68/PV.6), it was with \r\na more positive message from a President reporting \r\nsignificant achievements and lofty aspirations for the \r\nfuture. President Johnson-Sirleaf, full of gratitude, \r\ninformed the world that Liberia had just celebrated \r\n10 years of peace in August 2013, and that, despite some \r\nchallenges, was still registering remarkable progress on \r\nthe path of socioeconomic development. The country \r\nhad transitioned from an emphasis on stabilization to \r\na focus on transformation within the framework of \r\na long-term development agenda, Vision 2030. The \r\nPresident also informed the Assembly that the countries \r\nof the Mano River Basin Union — Liberia, Guinea, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire and Sierra Leone — were at peace and \r\nwere pursuing regional integration through initiatives \r\nthat would facilitate connectivity within their power \r\nand transport systems, thereby enhancing the cross-\r\nborder trade in which our market women are mostly \r\nengaged. She even reported on how a small contingent \r\nof Liberian peacekeepers, who are still in Mali \r\ntoday, had contributed to the laudable United Nations \r\npeacekeeping efforts there, creating an environment \r\nconducive to stability and democratic transition in that \r\ncountry.\r\nOne year later, as I address the Assembly, I am the \r\npurveyor of a different kind of story, and a sad one. Over \r\nthe past six months, a dark cloud has been hanging over \r\nthe Liberian landscape, such that instead of reporting \r\neconomic growth, we are constrained to report economic \r\ndecline. The implementation of virtually all the pillars \r\nof our Agenda for Transformation has been placed on \r\nhold, and gains are perhaps already being reversed. \r\nInstead of devoting attention to regional integration \r\nthrough the facilitation of power and transport projects, \r\nwe are talking about regional cooperation in dealing \r\nwith a deadly enemy. The market women who traded \r\ngoods and services across borders a year ago are now \r\nconstrained to remain within those borders and suffer \r\nthe consequences of economic inactivity.\r\nThe deadly enemy that has visited so much harm \r\nand misery on my country and our neighbours is the \r\nEbola virus disease, which began wreaking havoc in \r\nLiberia in March. Since the outbreak, the Government of \r\nLiberia has taken a host of measures. We have declared \r\na state of emergency and suspended schools, and, \r\nwith the constructive involvement of all stakeholders, \r\nincluding pastors, imams, chiefs, elders, young people, \r\nGovernment officials and opposition politicians, we \r\nhave stepped up awareness and prevention campaigns \r\nto address the rigid denial and deeply rooted traditional \r\nand cultural practices that create fertile ground for the \r\nspread of the disease. We have also committed and will \r\ncontinue to commit significant portions of our own \r\npaltry resources to the fight.\r\n14-55187 23/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\nIn spite of such efforts, which have been buttressed by \r\nthose of our partners, Ebola has confounded all of us and \r\nhas sprinted faster than our collective efforts, snuffing \r\nout the life candle of more than 1,800 of our compatriots, \r\nwith a total of nearly 3,500 infected. Cumulatively, \r\nwomen, as the majority among our health workforce and \r\nthe main caregivers in our deeply traditional society, \r\nhave been disproportionately affected. Sadly, as Ebola \r\nwidens its deadly circumference, it is creating a trail of \r\ntraumatized orphans across the country, which includes \r\na 10-year-old child from Barkedu, Lofa county, who \r\nis the last person standing from a family of 12. Our \r\nalready limited pool of health workers has been further \r\nreduced, because 89 of them have fallen victim to the \r\nvirus, out of a total of 182 infected.\r\nThe resulting panic that has arisen in health workers \r\nwho see their colleagues die from Ebola has precipitated \r\nthe closure of many health facilities across the country. \r\nAs we and our many international partners struggle to \r\ndouse the wildfire caused by Ebola, we are left with \r\ninadequate resources, time and personnel to attend to \r\nroutine illnesses such as malaria, typhoid fever and \r\nmeasles, thereby causing many more, tangential deaths. \r\nAn increasing number of pregnant women are dying in \r\nthe process of bringing forth life. In short, our public \r\nhealth system, which totally collapsed during our \r\nyears of conflict and was being gradually rebuilt, has \r\ncollapsed again under the weight of the deadly virus.\r\nEbola is not just a health crisis; it is a total crisis. It is \r\nan economic crisis, a social crisis and a potential political \r\nand security crisis. Indeed, its deleterious impact has \r\nbeen very wide and very deep. On the economic front, \r\nit has occasioned a 3.4 per cent downward slide in \r\neconomic growth in Liberia, and some experts have \r\npredicted that, if not contained quickly, it could cause a \r\n12 per cent decline in our economy in 2015. As a result \r\nof the slowdown in economic activities, our revenue \r\ngeneration capacity has been seriously undermined, \r\nthereby constricting our ability to provide basic social \r\nservices and to continue to fund key development \r\nprojects. The suspension of f lights as well as the travel \r\nand other restrictions and sanctions imposed on Liberia \r\nand other affected countries despite expert advice to \r\nthe contrary from the World Health Organization and \r\nothers, have not only undermined the humanitarian \r\nefforts aimed at quickly containing the disease, but \r\nhave also aggravated the adverse economic effects of \r\nthe Ebola crisis.\r\nAs destructive as the Liberian civil conflict was, at \r\nleast our people knew the warring factions and the front \r\nlines. With Ebola, the enemy is more insidious, and \r\nthere are no clear-cut front lines, because someone’s \r\nchild, someone’s husband or someone’s workmate \r\ncould actually be the enemy and in the front line at the \r\nsame time. That difficult feature of the disease, coupled \r\nwith a host of other challenges, has occasioned its rapid \r\nspread. We are heartened that, as a result of separate \r\nand joint appeals of the heads of State of Liberia, Sierra \r\nLeone and Guinea to the Secretary-General and leaders \r\nof friendly countries and institutions, the international \r\ncommunity is showing a better appreciation of the \r\nunprecedented scope and magnitude of the Ebola \r\noutbreak in our countries. There is a chorus of leaders \r\nadvocating and committing to support more robust, \r\nscaled up and urgent assistance to the affected countries.\r\nThanks to the Secretary-General and other \r\nworld leaders, the past few weeks have witnessed a \r\nhost of positive developments that constitute a major \r\nheightening of focus and scaling up of the international \r\nresponse. Those developments include the following.\r\nFirst, we welcome the announcement by President \r\nBarak Obama of the United States of his Government’s \r\ndecision to scale up assistance to the region, including \r\nthe deployment of 3,000 military and medical personnel \r\nto help us with the fight.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council meeting held on \r\n18 September 2014 (see S/PV.7268), under the leadership \r\nand Council presidency of the United States, adopted \r\nresolution 2177 (2014), which recognizes the Ebola \r\ncrisis as a threat to international peace and security, \r\nnecessitating a strong and concerted international \r\nresponse through firm commitments of support. The \r\nresolution also called on Member States to lift travel \r\nand other restrictions imposed on affected countries.\r\nThirdly, the Secretary-General announced on \r\n18 September his intention to establish the United \r\nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, which \r\nwas formally endorsed by Assembly resolution 69/1, \r\nsubmitted by the President and adopted on 19 September.\r\nFourthly, we have seen the start of the deployment \r\nby the African Union of contingents of medical and \r\nrelevant personnel drawn from across Africa to Liberia \r\nand other worst-affected countries.\r\nFifthly, the high-level meeting on response to the \r\nEbola virus disease outbreak, convened at Headquarters \r\n24/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nby the Secretary-General on 25 September, witnessed \r\nannouncements of substantial commitments of \r\nassistance by many countries.\r\nThose concrete demonstrations of solidarity have \r\ntaken many forms, and we are deeply grateful for all \r\nof them. They should, however, not lead us towards \r\ncomplacency, because we definitely have not yet \r\nachieved the 20-fold increase in response recommended \r\nby the experts to contain the disease. Additionally, \r\nwhile we struggle with the first war, which involves \r\nactually disrupting the transmission of Ebola, we must \r\nbegin to prepare for the second war of tackling the \r\nlong-term socioeconomic impacts of the Ebola crisis, \r\nincluding building and creating the capacity for a new \r\nhealth system that can robustly deal with any future \r\nhealth challenge, and raising the resources needed to \r\naddress a legion of socioeconomic, political, security \r\nand other challenges made more acute by the presence \r\nof Ebola.\r\nWe are also cognizant of the positive contributions \r\nof the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), \r\nwhich has helped us enjoy 10 years of peace. The \r\npresence of UNMIL in Liberia, especially at a time when \r\nwe were experiencing isolation, has helped to reassure \r\nour people and create a security climate conducive to \r\ntackling some of the multifaceted challenges of the \r\nEbola crisis. Therefore, the continued engagement \r\nof UNMIL in Liberia will be critical to enabling \r\nLiberia’s transition from the Ebola crisis to resume the \r\nimplementation of strategies for the achievement of our \r\nlong-term development agenda.\r\nEbola is a difficult enemy that has frustrated and \r\nbypassed our collective efforts in the past, causing some \r\nexperts to project that, in a worst case scenario, about \r\n1.4 million precious lives could be lost in our countries \r\nby January 2015. In spite of the gloom of today — and \r\nas Liberians ponder the question: “Will I, my wife, my \r\nhusband, my child, my friend or my workmate be one of \r\nthose to populate the 1.4 million doomsday statistics?”— \r\nwe should not sink into defeatism. Instead, President \r\nEllen Johnson-Sirleaf and the resilient Liberian people \r\nfeel that Ebola has presented us with a one-option, \r\nmultiple-choice test, and that option is to fight back. \r\nAnd we are fighting back.\r\nAs President Johnson-Sirleaf aptly put it in her \r\n17 September update to the people of Liberia on the \r\nEbola crisis:\r\n“I believe in the Liberian people. I believe that \r\nwe are stronger than the greatest threat with which \r\nwe are currently faced. And 1 believe we will \r\nprevail. The war did not defeat us, a completely \r\ndestroyed economy — the greatest collapse since \r\nWorld War II — did not defeat us. Ebola will not \r\ndefeat us”.\r\nWe know that the road ahead may be long, curvy \r\nand hilly. But with bigger, bolder, timely and sustained \r\nefforts on our part, buttressed by the international \r\ncommunity, we are sure that dawn will soon break on \r\nthis long, dark night occasioned by the Ebola virus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellence Mr. Nickolas Steele, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International Business \r\nof Grenada.\r\nMr. Steele (Grenada): I would like, first of all, \r\nto thank the outgoing President, Mr. John Ashe, for \r\nhis sterling efforts in presiding over the sixty-eighth \r\nsession of the General Assembly in a year that was \r\ndedicated to island States around the world. Let me \r\nalso congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa and welcome him \r\nas the incoming President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. He can count on Grenada’s \r\nsupport to contribute to the deliberations in a positive \r\nand meaningful way.\r\nAs we gather here in New York yet again, we can \r\ncelebrate the remarkable history of our institution in this \r\nbeautifully refurbished United Nations Headquarters. \r\nI wish to put on record Grenada’s appreciation to the \r\ndonors who contributed and to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his leadership on this project. With its large open \r\nspaces and glass façade, the building’s design speaks \r\nto our ideals of transparency, openness and dialogue. \r\nThe building’s mid-twentieth-century features recall \r\nthe spirit of an age when space was the new frontier.\r\nThe space age has given way to a new and \r\nexciting information age. Today, a young girl armed \r\nwith a smartphone in Gujarat, India, can Google the \r\nsame satellite images of our planet as a child in Great \r\nBritain. Exposed to the right ideas on the Internet, \r\nchildren — whether in Greensboro in the United \r\nStates, or Grenoble in France, or Grenada in the \r\nCaribbean — can have the same seeds of hope, the \r\nsame aspirations for happiness and personal growth, \r\nand the same sense of duty towards neighbourhood and \r\nplanet. For aspiring young people everywhere, coming \r\nof age is symbolized by ownership, not of a car, but of \r\n14-55187 25/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\na mobile phone or a computer tablet. Those are today’s \r\nvehicles on the information highway for the world’s \r\nyouth seeking ideas, identity and connectedness.\r\nWe come to the United Nations today to feel that \r\nsense of connectedness amid the chaos of today’s \r\nchallenges. We come to these refurbished Headquarters \r\nto renew our commitment to peace and security and \r\nto revitalize our mission, not to the stars, but to work \r\nfor a safer planet with shared prosperity for all. Today, \r\nin this iconic Hall, it is too soon to say “mission \r\naccomplished”, but for the most part, our original \r\nmission for dialogue and the rule of law among abiding \r\nnations has been accomplished.\r\nSitting here among ourselves, we are, for the most \r\npart, preaching to the converted. The long-standing \r\nconflict between Israel and Palestine has given way to a \r\nrealization that the only viable solution is the two-State \r\nsolution. Moreover, sworn enemies in this Hall now \r\nconfer on how to tackle much more sinister enemies \r\nof peace.\r\nThose new enemies have no f lags f luttering \r\nproudly outside, nor electronic nameplates inside. \r\nThey are not here in our space-age Hall; they are out \r\nthere in cyberspace, a place where violence and hate \r\nin isolated corners can spread like wildfire across the \r\nglobe. Captured on mobile phones and uploaded to the \r\nInternet, gruesome images from a remote backstreet \r\ncan inflict fear in the hearts of ordinary citizens on \r\nMain Street everywhere.\r\nThe shocking beheadings we see in the media are \r\nthe weeping ooze from the cancerous underbelly of our \r\nworld today. They are the symptoms of an insidious and \r\npervasive unease eating away at the very foundations \r\non which this great institution was built. And with each \r\nnew escalation of violence, we feel a sense of horror \r\nnot only at the acts themselves but perhaps more at our \r\ninability to act.\r\nWar and insecurity in the information age have \r\nmutated so much that neither our resolutions, our \r\nagencies nor our armies are enough to break the fever \r\nof this viral menace of transnational actors. And so, \r\nlooking beyond our Capital Master Plan that reimagines \r\nour twentieth-century beginnings, let us build a new \r\nInformation Master Plan fit for the twenty-first century \r\nwith electronic highways that will one day connect this \r\nHall to every child in every village.\r\nThe information age is a new season in the arc of our \r\ninstitution’s history — a new season in which everyone \r\nhas a voice, be they the youths of the Arab Spring or the \r\nOccupiers of Wall Street’s winter of discontent. Today’s \r\ninformation age brings a new transparency between \r\nthe haves and the have-nots — between the 1 per cent \r\nand the 99 per cent. Whether segmented by class, race, \r\nreligion or political affiliation, inequality is the disease \r\nof our times, contributing to the political eruptions all \r\nover the world.\r\nWe now have — for the first time — documented \r\nevidence of the root causes of the growing inequalities \r\nin society. A new economic treatise, entitled Capital in \r\nthe Twenty-First Century, by Thomas Piketty, analyses \r\nover a century of economic data and concludes that \r\nthe rich are getting richer, faster than everyone else. \r\nBut there are two things that reduce income inequality. \r\nThe first is the distribution of knowledge that promotes \r\ngrowth. The second is war, which destroys capital. The \r\nfirst option is a rising tide that lifts all ships; the second \r\nis a sinking stone that drowns all hope — the very \r\nantithesis of this Organization.\r\nWe must focus more of our global policy on proactive \r\ninterventions that promote sustainable growth. We must \r\nencourage economic growth by distributing knowledge \r\nthrough education, information and communication \r\ntechnology, as well as through skills and technology \r\ntransfers. We do indeed need an Information Master \r\nPlan if we are to proactively confront threats in the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe World Development Report 2011: Conflict, \r\nSecurity and Development, published by the World Bank, \r\nacknowledges that development agencies have not yet \r\nfully adapted to the needs of the twenty-first century \r\nand that they do not yet have the capacity to adequately \r\nhelp fragile States. It finds that unemployment is the \r\nnumber-one reason for youths to join criminal gangs \r\nand contending armies. It reminds us that investing in \r\ncitizen security, justice and jobs is essential to reducing \r\nviolence. We know that once mass violence takes root \r\nin a society, it can take a generation or more to recover.\r\nAs we look around at the violence in the world \r\ntoday, I ask the question: can our twentieth-century \r\ninstitutions cope with twenty-first-century shocks? \r\nDo we have the courage to be proactive in fostering \r\njobs and growth, or will we wait until violence erupts? \r\nThis year’s World Development Report 2014 is all about \r\nmanaging opportunity and managing risk, from the \r\nlevel of the household to the level of the international \r\ncommunity. The essence of the report is that the \r\n26/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nbenefits of proactive preparation can outweigh the \r\ncosts of responding retroactively.\r\nThe risks from climate shocks are among the \r\nmost terrifying for Grenada and for islands around \r\nthe world. Grenada places on record its appreciation \r\nfor the Secretary-General’s leadership in calling for a \r\nClimate Summit. In the last four years alone, we have \r\nseen f loods raging across the world. With the hottest \r\ntemperatures on record in recent years, forest fires have \r\nraged across almost all continents, devouring millions \r\nof acres of forest land, causing damages in the tens of \r\nbillions of dollars. Glacial retreats from the Andes to \r\nthe Himalayas and from Greenland to Antarctica are \r\nmoving at record speeds. We are seeing hurricanes and \r\ncyclones as never before.\r\nTwo years ago, right here in New York, Hurricane \r\nSandy struck and disabled the economic engine of the \r\nUnited States. It caused $68 billion worth of damage. \r\nBut this represents less than 1 per cent of the gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) of the United States in contrast \r\nwith the island States, where damages of between \r\n10 per cent and 50 per cent of GDP are common, and, in \r\nthe case of Grenada, where damages occurred totalling \r\n200 per cent of GDP from Hurricane Ivan alone. Even \r\nas we speak, this week Grenada was plagued with \r\nunseasonably high rains that have caused numerous \r\nlandslides. The value of the damage is yet to be \r\ndetermined. Like our neighbours Saint Lucia and Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines in 2013, we are forced to \r\ndedicate already scarce financial resources to repair \r\nand mitigate this.\r\nThere is a link between these events and the high \r\nindebtedness of small Caribbean islands. To paraphrase \r\nthe World Bank’s country assistance strategy for the \r\nEastern Caribbean, the years when fiscal policy failed \r\nto explain increases in debt-to-GDP ratios were the \r\nsame years when natural disasters occurred. Given \r\nthese risks, island States need concessionary financing. \r\nThis is critical to ensuring growth, jobs and economic \r\ndevelopment. For small island developing States (SIDS), \r\na robust economy, combined with risk-management \r\npolicies and instruments, is the best combination for \r\nresilience.\r\nWhen our current Administration was elected \r\n16 months ago, the indebtedness of our country was \r\nunsustainable. But the Grenadian people came together \r\nunder the leadership of Prime Minister Mitchell. \r\nUnions, churches, non-governmental organizations, \r\npolitical parties and businesses all rallied to form a \r\nsocial compact to put Grenada on a firm fiscal footing. \r\nWe tightened our belts and asked the Grenadian people \r\nto contribute more as we undertook our home-grown \r\nfiscal reform. The indebtedness of the SIDS must \r\nbe counted among the many challenges of our time. \r\nThe annual cry of the small island States to make \r\nconcessionary funding available is the early-warning \r\nsystem for the international community. Let us settle \r\nthe least developed countries graduation issue in \r\nfavour of the SIDS, rather than use it as a parallel \r\nclimate-negotiation tool against the SIDS.\r\nOne country that is singled out for its stellar \r\nmanagement of disasters is Cuba. We all have much \r\nto learn from Cuba on areas as diverse as disaster risk \r\nmanagement and public-health management. Cuba \r\nsends its engineers, teachers and doctors around the \r\nworld to improve the lives of others. Is it not time to fully \r\nrecognize the contributions of Cuba to the international \r\ncommunity — and if not now, then when? Is it not time \r\nto end the Cold War attitudes to Cuba — and if not now, \r\nthen when? Is it not time to end the embargo against \r\nCuba — and if not now, then when?\r\nThe explosion of violence that we see in today’s \r\ntrouble spots is driven by the f lawed principle of \r\ndisrespect for international law and the territorial \r\nintegrity of Member States. There comes a time when \r\nold enemies must turn swords into ploughshares and \r\nlook to a future with dignity and with hope.\r\nJust as climate change is the challenge of our time, \r\nit can also be said that climate change is possibly one \r\nof the greatest opportunities for wealth creation and \r\nshared prosperity that this generation has seen. Today, \r\nthe renewable energy market is estimated to be in \r\nthe order of $16 trillion, including $12 billion in the \r\nCaribbean alone. In 2012, there were some 6 million jobs \r\nin renewable energy and the International Renewable \r\nEnergy Agency (IRENA) expects 17 million jobs \r\nby 2030. Today, pension funds with collective assets \r\nexceeding $12 trillion are focusing on climate risk, \r\nrenewable energy and energy efficiency.\r\nIsland States like Grenada are seized not only of \r\nclimate challenge, but also with climate solutions. For \r\nus, a robust economy, combined with sound disaster \r\nrisk-management policies and instruments, is the most \r\nsustainable form of adaptation to climate change. \r\nBut in Grenada, we cannot educate our people if our \r\nschoolchildren have no access to electricity. Due \r\nto the high import costs of fossil fuels, electricity in \r\nGrenada costs four to five times higher than it does in \r\n14-55187 27/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\ndeveloped countries. But countries with low electricity \r\nprices have to subsidize renewables; not so in the \r\nislands. Islands like Grenada come to the climate table, \r\nnot like hapless victims cap-in-hand, but offering the \r\ninternational community 100 per cent renewables that \r\ncan be introduced with zero subsidies.\r\nIf we are to limit global carbon dioxide concentrations \r\nto 450 parts per million, then, according to the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth \r\nassessment report, our electricity sector needs a total \r\ntransformation. While island States are the least of the \r\nemitters, they are the most cost-effective places for \r\nrenewables. I congratulate the Small Island Developing \r\nStates Sustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK), \r\nIRENA and Sustainable Energy For All for acting on \r\nthis.\r\nGrenada is working to transform its electricity \r\nsector. Solving the energy challenge for islands like \r\nGrenada will remove a drag on our economies and \r\nbetter position us to withstand environmental shocks. \r\nThis is adaptation with prospects for jobs, growth and \r\nshared prosperity for all. I am delighted to announce \r\nthat, in addition to working with Germany, the World \r\nBank, SIDS DOCK and IRENA, Grenada has signed \r\na groundbreaking memorandum of understanding \r\nwith the United States to assist us in transforming our \r\nenergy mix, as we announced in Samoa. We have also \r\nsigned an memorandum of understanding with New \r\nZealand to help us better understand our geothermal \r\nresources. Grenada will serve as the pilot country for \r\nthe regional energy initiative of the United States and \r\nwill work with New Zealand on geothermal energy. \r\nWe welcome others to join this partnership and this \r\nunfolding success story that is Green Grenada.\r\nAs we have said before, we wish to recommend \r\nthe following actions. Let us operationalize the \r\nGreen Climate Fund with a window for islands. \r\nLet us implement 100 per cent renewable energy in \r\nisland States. Let us put a price on carbon and stop \r\nsubsidizing fossil fuels. Let us decarbonize food \r\nsecurity. Agriculture, forestry and other land use \r\ncontribute 25 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Let \r\nus have greater support for climate-smart agriculture \r\nthat can deliver a triple win of increasing productivity \r\nand incomes, increasing resilience to climate change, \r\nand reducing or removing carbon emissions. Grenada \r\nis pleased to be working with the Government of the \r\nNetherlands on a climate-smart agricultural alliance \r\nand on Global Blue Growth and Food Security Initiative.\r\nBlue growth is vital for the economies of island \r\nStates around the world, and our tri-island State \r\nof Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique sees \r\nitself as an Ocean State, given that our exclusive \r\neconomic zone in the sea is over 70 times larger than \r\nour land mass. Our tri-island State is pleased to host \r\nthe secretariat of the Caribbean Challenge Initiative \r\n(CCI), which is supported by Germany and others. \r\nThe CCI promotes an enhanced marine environment, \r\nand Grenada is committed to conserving its near-shore \r\nmarine environment. Through reports like the Sunken \r\nBillions, the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization have shown that conservation efforts \r\nare critical to ensuring maximum economic yield in \r\nfisheries.\r\nIn the past 30 years, we have lost 30 per cent of our \r\ncorals and mangroves. This is why Grenada welcomes \r\nefforts such as the Global Blue Growth Initiative and \r\nthe Global Partnership for Oceans, and the efforts of \r\nThe Economist and United States Secretary of State \r\nJohn Kerry to bring renewed attention to the oceans. We \r\nlook forward to welcoming our partners to Grenada in \r\nJanuary 2015 for the launch of the Global Blue Growth \r\nand Food Security initiatives.\r\nIn closing, Grenada acknowledges the successes \r\nof the 2014 Third International Conference on Small \r\nIsland Development States, held in Samoa, and, building \r\non the momentum of Samoa, we look forward to the \r\nsuccessful conclusion to the sustainable development \r\ngoals process leading into the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris \r\nnext year.\r\nAs we move forward, let us remember that a number \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals have not been \r\nachieved. We have a duty, therefore, to re-examine our \r\napproach to peace, security and shared prosperity. We \r\nneed collective action on a global consensus. We need \r\nto act now before it is too late. We must shed the old \r\nways and adopt twenty-first-century approaches for \r\nthis millennium generation if we are to bequeath to \r\nthem and future generations the bounty we inherited \r\nand the bounty that they deserve.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Camillo Gonsalves, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade, Consumer Affairs \r\nand Information Technology of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines.\r\n28/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nWe gather this week to reaffirm our commitment to \r\npeace, justice and development. Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines proudly recognizes Mr. John Ashe, son \r\nof our Caribbean soil and President of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-eighth session, and commends \r\nhim for his invaluable contribution in advancing the \r\ninternational agenda during his superlative tenure. We \r\njoyously welcome the current President as our new \r\nstandard-bearer. As part of the African diaspora, we \r\ncelebrate with the continent of Africa in claiming him \r\nas one of our own, and in investing the same faith and \r\nconfidence in him in this role as do the people of his \r\nnative Uganda.\r\nFifteen years into the twenty-first century, the \r\nchallenges of our times have caused some nations \r\nto question the value or role of sovereignty in an \r\nincreasingly borderless world. Globalization and \r\nmodernity have unleashed a number of forces that \r\noperate independently of national Governments or \r\nborders. They include the ills of climate change; \r\ncommunicable diseases such as Ebola; and economic \r\ncontagion that spreads like wildfire as external shocks \r\nthat pose serious developmental and existential threats \r\nbeyond the scope of individual States to address. \r\nGroups have emerged — from terrorists to drug cartels \r\nto certain rapacious multinationals — that span the \r\nglobe and exploit systemic weaknesses to further their \r\nown nefarious self-interest.\r\nThe pressures of keeping pace in an interconnected \r\nworld have prompted suggestions that we can no longer \r\nrely on a traditional rulebook that does not specifically \r\ncontemplate our modern challenges. Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines emphatically rejects this suggestion. \r\nThe rulebook that governs our international cooperation \r\nis the Charter of the United Nations, and its principal \r\ngolden rule is that of respect for the sovereign equality \r\nof all States.\r\nTo be sure, certain administrative aspects of our \r\nrulebook — for example, the composition and working \r\nmethods of our fossilized and increasingly irrelevant \r\nSecurity Council — are clearly long overdue for \r\nmeaningful reform. However, the principles that inform \r\nour Charter and undergird the Assembly are timeless. \r\nAny attempt to deviate from the Charter in word, deed \r\nor spirit would constitute an assault on sovereignty, a \r\ndeparture from diplomacy, and the improvisation of \r\ninternational law on the f ly.\r\nThe loss of sovereignty has never benefited the \r\nweak or powerless. The erosion of sovereignty has \r\nnever restrained the interests of the powerful. The list \r\nof nations whose sovereignty has been violated in the \r\ninterest of great Power convenience grows inexorably \r\nlonger, while the tally of those whose populations are \r\ndemonstrably better off for such violations remains \r\ntragically short. Accordingly, Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines rejects the choice between modern \r\ninterconnectivity and traditional sovereignty as false \r\nand intended to accelerate a global slide into lawless \r\nunilateralism.\r\nAs upholders of and adherents to international law, \r\nwe continue to struggle in search of common themes \r\nto help us understand which coup d’état is legal and \r\nwhich is not; which foreign intervention is just and \r\nwhich is criminal; which particular sovereignty or \r\nterritorial integrity is worth fighting for, and which \r\nshould be conveniently disregarded and swept under \r\nthe rug of endless, impotent debate; which national \r\nborder constitutes a barrier, and which represents an \r\ninvitation; which World Trade Organization decision \r\nwill be enforced to the detriment of the weak, and \r\nwhich, as in the case of our Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) neighbour Antigua and Barbuda, will be \r\nignored by the guilty but powerful party. As a small, \r\nopen, vulnerable State, we cannot accept the suggestion \r\nthat our existence rests on the whim, generosity or \r\nbenign neglect of powerful States. International law \r\nand sovereign equality are the bulwarks against the \r\ntype of naked aggression and unilateralism that have \r\ntoo often led our nations to the precipice of war.\r\nThe cancer of terrorism continues to spread. The \r\nworld has witnessed the celebration of savagery and \r\nthe multiplication of misery by those who sow death \r\nand hatred in the name of religion. Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines, like every other civilized nation, \r\nis outraged at the global rise of militant groups that \r\ncommit unspeakable acts of mass violence in their \r\nquest to enforce a brutal and indefensible social order.\r\nHowever, the fact that terrorists disregard national \r\nborders and sovereignty is no excuse for us to do the \r\nsame. We must not stoop to their level by neglecting \r\nthe bedrock principles of the peaceful coexistence \r\nof nations. Nor must we ever repeat the mistake of \r\nbelieving that terrorism is a force that can be harnessed \r\nor supported to further some greater political objective. \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines cannot accept that \r\nthe difference between noble rebel and evil terrorist \r\n14-55187 29/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\ncan hinge on something as arbitrary as on which side of \r\na border they decide to perform their rapes, beheadings \r\nand bombings. We unequivocally support genuine \r\nefforts targeted at eliminating this scourge, and we \r\ncall for global solidarity and international cooperation \r\nin this urgent cause. Politics may make for strange \r\nbedfellows, but in a civilized world, humanity must \r\nalways trump ideology in the fight against murderous \r\nbarbarism.\r\nThe political manipulation of the term “terrorist” \r\nthreatens our shared resolve to eliminate its growing \r\nmenace. Nowhere is this manipulation more glaringly \r\nobjectionable than in the false designation by the United \r\nStates of the Republic of Cuba as a State sponsor of \r\nterrorism. Cuba has been a victim of State terrorism, a \r\ncondemner of State terrorism and a collaborator in the \r\nfight against State terrorism. Meanwhile, other actors \r\nnakedly support and lavishly fund the most despicable \r\nterrorist groups, without so much as a hint of public \r\nreproach. It is hard to imagine why the United States, \r\na firm, honourable and unquestioned global leader \r\nin the fight against terrorism, and the target of the \r\nmost heinous attacks, would want to distract itself, \r\nor its allies, from the fight at hand by maintaining its \r\nunfounded characterization of Cuba.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines reiterates the \r\ncall of the overwhelming majority of States for an \r\nimmediate end to the illegal economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba. The external \r\nprojection of political self-interest is not a sovereign \r\nexercise, but a retrograde and anachronistic attack on \r\nthe very principles that undergird the Organization. \r\nThe United States is a far greater nation than this petty, \r\npunitive and illegal embargo suggests. We encourage it \r\nto demonstrate the courage to cast aside this Cold War \r\nrelic.\r\nWe are one month removed from the disastrous \r\nconsequences of yet another violent conflict between \r\ncombatants in Israel and the State of Palestine. \r\nThousands are dead and thousands more were \r\nwounded — the overwhelming majority of whom \r\nwere Palestinian civilians. Whatever the motivations \r\nfor that particular conflict, no one can doubt that \r\nthe underlying problem remains unaddressed and \r\nunresolved. At its root is the invasion, occupation and \r\neconomic strangulation of Palestine, and the steady, \r\nillegal erosion of its internationally established borders.\r\nDespite regrettable actions on both sides of this \r\ndispute, no amount of political relativism can apportion \r\nblame equally between occupier and occupied. The \r\nunquestionable right of Israel to exist in peace and \r\ndefend itself does not and cannot give it unfettered \r\nlicence to occupy, oppress and suppress the sovereign \r\nrights of the Palestinian people. Israel is a powerful, \r\naccomplished, democratic nation with powerful \r\nfriends. It diminishes itself and the status of its allies \r\nby its unchallenged actions in Palestine. Once again, \r\nthe absence of borders and the disregard of sovereignty \r\nthreaten to make the concept of a two-State solution \r\nnothing more than feel-good rhetoric with limited \r\napplicability on the ground.\r\nA great Caribbean artist, Peter Tosh, once lamented \r\nin song that while “everyone is crying out for peace, \r\nnone are crying out for justice”. Peace cannot be \r\nassumed in the absence of war, nor can it be established \r\nin the absence of justice. This Assembly owes the \r\npeople of Palestine its attention and action in the long- \r\noverdue quest for real peace and statehood.\r\nClimate change does not respect national \r\nborders — a fact known all too well in Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines. Despite a tiny carbon footprint and \r\nminuscule emissions, our country has nonetheless been \r\nrepeatedly victimized by weather anomalies partially \r\ncaused by the historical and continued environmental \r\nabuse of major emitters. In the past four years, \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines has experienced \r\na hurricane, a drought and two floods. The loss and \r\ndamage caused by each of those events has resulted \r\nin annual double-digit hits to our gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP). Last December, in a mere three hours \r\nof unseasonal rainfall, 17 per cent of our GDP was \r\nwashed away in f lash f looding. Our sister islands of \r\nGrenada and Dominica were similarly affected. Lives \r\nand livelihoods were lost, homes and infrastructure \r\nwere destroyed, and a developmental hole was dug from \r\nwhich it will take years to emerge.\r\nYet, despite the gathering and intensifying global \r\nthreat of climate change, with its real and ruinous \r\npresent-day impacts, historical and major emitters \r\ncontinue to act as if the planet had time on its side. \r\nThe excuses offered for continued inaction, whether \r\npolitical, historical, scientific or economic, grow \r\nincreasingly indefensible. The prospects of genuine \r\nprogress against climate change become increasingly \r\nremote with each passing day of diplomatic dithering, \r\nbuck-passing and finger-pointing.\r\nLast week, the Secretary-General convened a \r\nhigh-level Climate Summit here at United Nations \r\n30/31 14-55187\r\nA/69/PV.18 29/09/2014\r\nHeadquarters in an admirable attempt to galvanize \r\npolitical will for an ambitious and legally binding climate \r\ntreaty by 2015. However, the tangible results were less \r\nthan encouraging. Despite some welcome new pledges, \r\nthe numbers simply do not add up to anything close to \r\nwhat is required to cap global warming at 1.5°C above \r\npre-industrial levels. Furthermore, the new resources \r\nraised and pledged for the financing of adaptation to \r\nclimate change were a drop in the bucket — akin to \r\nhaving a bake sale to settle the national debt.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is fearful that \r\nthe legally binding agreement, which we are scheduled \r\nto enact next year, will be insufficiently ambitious to \r\nsolve our looming climate crisis, and that adaptation \r\nfinancing will be woefully short of what is truly required. \r\nIf narrow interests and local electoral cowardice force \r\nus to retreat behind our national borders and bury our \r\nheads in the sand, we may squander a decade of effort \r\nand our only real chance to save the planet on which we \r\nlive. The stakes are that high. We cannot afford to fail.\r\nIt is appropriate that the President of the General \r\nAssembly will preside over the launch of the \r\nInternational Decade of People of African Descent, \r\nwhich runs from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2024. \r\nThe theme of that Decade will be “People of African \r\ndescent: recognition, justice and development”. The \r\nmeaningful and action-oriented implementation of \r\nthis theme can have far-reaching positive effects on \r\nthe African continent and among its far-f lung diaspora \r\nalike.\r\nOne element of recognition, justice and development \r\nthat will be of central importance to Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines and the wider Caribbean Community \r\nis the advancement of our claims for reparatory justice \r\nfrom the European colonizing Powers that engaged in \r\nnative genocide, the transatlantic slave trade and the \r\nprolonged system of chattel slavery itself. Over the past \r\nyear, CARICOM Heads of State and Government have \r\nunanimously approved a series of policies, structures \r\nand initiatives aimed at educating our populations \r\nand engaging former slave-holding and slave-trading \r\nnations in a conversation about reparatory justice. The \r\nlevel of priority that CARICOM Governments accord to \r\nthe issue of reparatory justice cannot be overstated. At \r\nthe historical root of our region’s many developmental \r\nimpediments is an enduring legacy of slavery, which \r\nis the unchanging millstone that we have been forced \r\nto carry uphill for generations. We seek the support of \r\nthe international community in furthering our just and \r\ntimely cause.\r\nSimilarly, in a region still grappling with the \r\naftereffects of systematic discrimination, victimization \r\nand human rights violations under the cover of unjust \r\nlaw, we cannot countenance the re-emergence of \r\njudicially sanctioned bigotry within our Caribbean \r\ncivilization. The application of the year-old decision \r\nof the Constitutional Court of the Dominican Republic \r\ncontinues to retroactively deny thousands of Dominican-\r\nborn citizens of their rights to nationality, identity \r\nand equal protection. The unanimous international \r\ncondemnation of the decision has led to welcome and \r\nincreased political interaction between Haiti and the \r\nDominican Republic on a host of bilateral issues. We \r\nhold out every hope that those discussions between \r\nneighbours will benefit both countries.\r\nHowever, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and the \r\nwider CARICOM remain outraged at the core human \r\nrights violations that have not been corrected and cannot \r\nbe resolved by bilateral tête-à-tête. We are beyond the \r\npoint where continuing human rights violations can \r\nbe masked behind seemingly benign bureaucracy. \r\nWe call on the international community to assist our \r\nbrothers in the Dominican Republic in reinstating the \r\nconstitutional and human rights of those Dominicans \r\nwho have been so wrongly stripped of their citizenship \r\nand dignity.\r\nLast year, from this rostrum, Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines called on the United Nations to accept its \r\nrole and offer recompense to the victims of the cholera \r\noutbreak in Haiti, it having been established that United \r\nNations peacekeepers brought the cholera with them to \r\nHaiti (see A/68/PV.16). A year later, the United Nations \r\ncontinues to dodge its moral and ethical responsibility. \r\nThe legitimacy of the Organization to conduct future \r\npeacekeeping missions and the legacy of its leadership \r\nat the highest levels will be irreparably damaged by any \r\nfailure to immediately redress this glaring wrong.\r\nThe prestige and legitimacy of the United Nations \r\ncan be further enhanced through further acceptance \r\nof the reasonable calls for Taiwan’s meaningful \r\nparticipation in the specialized agencies of the United \r\nNations. Taiwan already participates actively and \r\nconstructively in many critical international bodies. \r\nMy country and several others in the Caribbean and \r\nCentral America bear testimony to Taiwan’s principled \r\nconduct of its intergovernmental relations. Surely the \r\n14-55187 31/31\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.18\r\ntime has now come for this exemplar of the magnificent \r\nChinese civilization to be permitted to participate in \r\nthe work of various agencies of this world body.\r\nThe chosen theme for this general debate — “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda” — reflects a wise focus on a \r\ncentral priority and core strength of this institution. The \r\nexercise and advancement of the right to development is \r\nan overarching priority for the overwhelming majority \r\nof the world’s peoples, and it is the absence of sufficient \r\ndevelopmental progress that is often the root cause of a \r\ngreat deal of global violence and unrest.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda must coalesce \r\naround a series of goals and targets that offer a \r\npeople-centred path of progress for developing \r\ncountries. In elaborating that agenda, and in this, \r\nthe International Year of Small Island Developing \r\nStates (SIDS), it is critical that the vulnerabilities and \r\nunique characteristics of SIDS inform that document. \r\nThe recently agreed Small Island Developing States \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (A/CONF.223/3, \r\nannex), which emerged from the historic Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, must constitute a foundational input in shaping \r\nthe development agenda in areas such as concessional \r\nfinancing for development, inequality, poverty \r\nalleviation, debt relief, disaster-risk reduction, oceans \r\nmanagement and education.\r\nIn that regard, we consider it vital that the post-\r\n2015 goals and indicators focus equally on targets \r\nwithin developing countries and measurable, timely \r\ncommitments from development partners. A major \r\nshortcoming of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nhas been the nebulous nature of the so-called global \r\npartnership for development. Let us anchor our \r\nshared future ambitions in concrete, measurable and \r\npredictable action.\r\nCivilized Governments and peoples must respect \r\nborders and sovereignty even if some of the forces \r\nunleashed by globalization and modernity do not. Let \r\nus build on what is right, good and proper in our new \r\ninterconnected world and cast away not the rulebook \r\nbut the excuses for disregarding its time-honoured \r\nrules.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines celebrates the \r\ngood of a world in which every student of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines can browse the stacks of an American \r\nlibrary using his or her own Taiwanese computer \r\nthat was assembled in China. It welcomes a business \r\nenvironment where we can rely on the support of an \r\nAmerican non-governmental organization in engaging \r\nan Icelandic company and its Canadian counterpart \r\nin harnessing our national geothermal resources and \r\npropelling us towards 100 per cent renewable energy. We \r\ncelebrate an international solidarity in which brotherly \r\nnations offer support in our time of need after a natural \r\ndisaster, and engineers and architects convene on our \r\nshores to help us rebuild. We welcome technology that \r\nallows us the opportunity to communicate, celebrate \r\nor commiserate with our migrant diaspora in real time \r\nand affords them the opportunity to send remittances \r\nto their families at home from every corner of the \r\nglobe. We value an international order that allows \r\na tiny State to disagree respectfully with a large one \r\nwithout fear of unjust repercussions. We revel in \r\nregional integration arrangements, like the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas \r\nand the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, where sovereignty is respected and often pooled, \r\nin furthering a cooperative, people-centred vision for \r\ngrowth and development.\r\nThose are not dreams but modern realities in our \r\ncountry today. They demonstrate the paths of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and development that are possible when \r\nsovereignty is enhanced, not eroded. Any nation can \r\nlike or dislike another nation, approve or disapprove of \r\nits decisions, admonish or praise its actions, befriend \r\nor avoid its Governments. Those are sovereign rights. \r\nBut every nation is obliged to respect its counterpart’s \r\nequal and unfettered right to exist, act and determine \r\nits own political destiny and development path.\r\nThe challenge of the twenty-first century is the \r\nobsolescence, not of the rulebook, but of the outmoded \r\nplaybook of cynical strategies, tactics and inconsistent \r\napplication of international law by those who see it as \r\na tool to further their goals, rather than a restraint on \r\nhegemonic geopolitical ambition. Sovereignty is not the \r\nright to erect a wall of repression or injustice around \r\nnational borders. Nor is it the right to protect and \r\nproject national interests to the detriment of another. It \r\nis neither sword nor shield. It is, instead, a responsibility \r\nto adhere to an ethic of reciprocity — to do unto other \r\nnations only what one’s own nation would accept being \r\ndone unto itself.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
