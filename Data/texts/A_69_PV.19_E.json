We fully trust that, thanks to his \r\nable leadership, the work of the Assembly during this \r\nsession will come to a fruitful conclusion, and we wish \r\nhim every success in that endeavour. We would also \r\nlike to express our appreciation for the skilful manner \r\nin which his predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, led the work \r\nof the Assembly at its previous session. In addition, I \r\nwould like to welcome the tireless and mighty efforts \r\nbeing undertaken by the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, to manage this Organization in accordance \r\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which focuses on the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. We thank him for \r\nhis commendable and special efforts to support the \r\npolitical process in Yemen.\r\nI would like to highlight a happy coincidence. This \r\ngeneral debate is taking place at a time when Yemen is \r\nobserving the anniversary of its two glorious revolutions \r\nof September and October. Those events were very \r\nimportant occasions for us, and I would like, therefore, \r\nto congratulate, from this rostrum, the valiant people \r\nof Yemen and commend them on their resolve and the \r\nsacrifices that they have made to achieve freedom and \r\nto put an end to oppression, injustice and despotism. In \r\naddition, I would commend our people on the efforts \r\nfor change that they have been undertaking wisely and \r\npatiently for 50 years now.\r\nSince the beginning of 2011, Yemen has taken \r\nmeasures to effect change and address the successive \r\npolitical and economic crises that arose owing to a lack \r\nof political prospects. Those crises all but ravaged our \r\ncountry and led it to the brink of civil war and chaos. \r\nThey have also had very negative repercussions at the \r\npolitical, economic, security and humanitarian levels \r\nin Yemen. The Yemeni people realized that the best \r\nway to put an end to those crises was through national \r\ndialogue.\r\nI would like, therefore, once again to thank all of \r\nthose who provided their support to the people of Yemen \r\nand to a political settlement of the situation in Yemen, \r\nin particular through the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\n(GCC) Initiative and the Implementation Mechanism. \r\nI would like to thank Saudi Arabia, in particular the \r\nCustodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Abdullah Bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud. I thank the GCC and its Secretary \r\nGeneral, Mr. Al Zayani. I would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and his Special \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.19\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n19th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 29 September 2014, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\nAdviser on Yemen, Mr. Benomar. In addition, I thank \r\nthe members of the Security Council for their support \r\nfor the righteous political process in Yemen. I thank \r\nthe League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation, the European Union and all the countries \r\nand international organizations and institutions that \r\nhave supported my country.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to mention the \r\nexceptional and historic visit of the Security Council \r\nto Sana’a on 27 January 2013. That visit was a strong \r\nsignal of support from the international community to \r\nYemen and to its extraordinary peaceful transition of \r\npower through political dialogue and on the basis of the \r\nGCC Initiative, the Implementation Mechanism and the \r\nroad map seeking to put an end to the crisis and steer \r\nYemen in the safe and right direction. We must also not \r\nforget the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, \r\nnamely resolutions 2014 (2011), 2051 (2012) and 2140 \r\n(2014). They have lent political weight to the work of \r\nthe United Nations on the political process in Yemen.\r\nNor should we forget the periodic reports of the \r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General, Mr. Benomar, \r\non the progress in the political situation and the \r\nchallenges that Yemen has been facing. Those reports \r\nhave played a very important role, because they have \r\nsent a message to all political parties in Yemen that are \r\ntrying to stall the political process; it is a message that \r\nsays that we will not let anybody threaten the unity, \r\nsecurity and stability of Yemen, with all of the resulting \r\nimplications for international peace and security.\r\nI would also like to commend President Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour, who has shown great \r\nperseverance in rebuilding a new federal Yemen on \r\nthe basis of Yemen’s inclusive National Dialogue \r\nConference. Yemen signed the Gulf Initiative for Yemen \r\nand thereby began the transition process. We were able \r\nto achieve the goals set for the first stage of transition. \r\nA Government of National Reconciliation was formed, \r\na military affairs committee was established, and early \r\npresidential elections were organized.\r\nWe then began the second stage of the transitional \r\nprocess. Among the most important achievements \r\nof that phase was the National Dialogue Conference, \r\nwhich took place on 28 January 2014. In addition, we \r\nhave set up a drafting committee for a constitution. \r\nThat committee is about to submit its first draft of \r\nthe new constitution. After the draft’s adoption, there \r\nwill be a referendum on it. Furthermore, the Supreme \r\nCommission for Elections and Referendum has created \r\nan electronic register for the purpose of registering \r\nvoters.\r\nWe have made notable progress in the political \r\nprocess. However, Yemen still faces great challenges \r\nthat have nearly destroyed the country and are trying \r\nto bring it back to square one. We would cite, inter alia, \r\nthe many dangerous events that occurred in Yemen as \r\na result of the recent political and military escalation \r\nprovoked by the Ansar Allah group, which besieged \r\nthe capital, Sana’a, despite the decision taken by the \r\nYemeni people at the inclusive National Dialogue \r\nConference no longer to use weapons or violence to \r\nsettle their political differences.\r\nThe Government undertook to deal with the issue \r\nof escalation wisely and patiently, because our nation \r\ncan no longer bear to put up with conflict. Indeed, \r\nthe citizens of Yemen are buckling under the burden \r\nresulting from successive financial crises. All of our \r\npeople aspire to peace and stability. A great many \r\npolitical efforts have been undertaken to end the crisis, \r\nwhich led to the signing of the Peace and National \r\nPartnership Agreement. However, the Ansar Allah \r\ngroup chose military means, attacking institutions of \r\nthe State, looting and pillaging them as well as private \r\nhomes.\r\nThe militia entered our capital, Sana’a, where \r\nit remains. The success of the terrorist groups is the \r\nresult of political support and logistical coordination \r\nprovided by members of the former regime. But we \r\ntook a political approach based on conciliation and \r\nmade further political efforts leading to the signing a \r\nfew days ago of a new security annex to the Agreement \r\nin order to maintain social cohesion, so that our people \r\ncan devote their efforts to the political process and to \r\nimplementing the final stages of a critical turning point \r\nin our national life.\r\nAll political parties in Yemen need to undertake to \r\nuphold the commitments in the Agreement. In addition, \r\nthe international community needs to continue to \r\nprovide its political support and economic assistance \r\nto Yemen. We also need for strong and firm positions \r\nto be taken by the Security Council, condemning all \r\nparties that seek to undermine the political process. \r\nThe international community has condemned the \r\nevents referred to and has called on the Yemeni parties \r\nto respect the commitments and pledges made during \r\nthe National Dialogue Conference.\r\n14-55191 3/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\nIt should be noted that Yemen is also dealing with \r\nmajor economic challenges, including a scarcity of \r\nresources, an increase in unemployment and poverty \r\nand growing budgetary deficits. In addition, Yemen \r\nis experiencing a humanitarian crisis that cannot be \r\noverlooked, because half of our population, namely, \r\n14.7 million people, need some form of humanitarian \r\nassistance. Moreover, Yemen is currently hosting \r\naround a million refugees from countries of the Horn \r\nof Africa.\r\nWe have an annual humanitarian response plan in \r\nYemen, but the plan has not mobilized the necessary \r\nsupport. The international community knows, however, \r\nthat, if the humanitarian situation worsens further, that \r\nwill have an impact on the political process. In the \r\nface of the very difficult economic and humanitarian \r\ncontext that has nearly destroyed our national economy, \r\nthe Government of national reconciliation took the \r\ndecision to amend the price of oil derivatives, adopted \r\na set of austerity measures and fiscal and tax reforms, \r\nand agreed to provide social security coverage to more \r\n250,000 people. We have also put the final touches on \r\nan electronic human-resources management system \r\nfor police and army personnel. We are also working \r\nprogressively in the area of agriculture and fisheries.\r\nUndoubtedly, Yemen expects a great deal from \r\nits fraternal and friendly neighbouring countries at \r\nthis very difficult time. We need economic support \r\ncommensurate with the challenges that we are facing. \r\nThat support could reduce the costs associated with \r\nthe economic reforms that we will be launching in the \r\nfuture.\r\nYemen has seen an improvement in the security \r\nsituation in our country. We have taken steps to \r\nrestructure our armed forces and police. However, the \r\nsecurity situation in Yemen is still rather fragile and \r\nis an obstacle preventing the success of our political \r\nprocesses and economic growth. Yemen has been \r\naffected by the scourge of terrorism, which has spared \r\nno nationality, sect or religion. That terrorism is not \r\nonly threatening Yemen currently but the region and \r\nthe entire world. We have played a pioneering role in \r\nstriving to thwart a scourge that has embedded itself \r\ninto the lives and traditions of our people and of the \r\npeople of all the countries of our region and the world. \r\nThe number of non-Yemenite elements in those terrorist \r\ngroups is 70 per cent.\r\nThe international community needs to tighten its \r\nranks to help Yemen to combat the scourge. We need \r\nsupport from the international community to combat \r\nterrorism in the Pacific region and the Arabian Gulf, \r\nwhich is a window open to the entire world. We are \r\nseeking to continue our efforts very actively, and \r\nwe will spare no effort to ensure that our countries \r\ncontinue to go in the right direction and to put an end to \r\nall bastions of terrorism, to polarization and hegemony, \r\nbecause all peoples aspire to a safe, stable life, within a \r\nclimate marked by justice and partnership, legality and \r\nfreedom. In order to combat the security challenges, \r\nwe need support from friendly countries as part of \r\nefforts to combat terrorism. We also need cooperation \r\nin logistics, training and capacity-building, because \r\nYemen’s stability will have a positive impact on the \r\nregion and the entire world.\r\nDespite the challenges that Yemen is facing \r\neconomically and politically and in terms of security, \r\nwe have not been sheltered from the other crises that \r\nthe world is facing. We have closely followed all of the \r\nsuffering the world over, but particularly that of the \r\nPalestinian people, who have been killed and mutilated, \r\nwith the infrastructure in their country being destroyed \r\nand new lethal weapons being used to commit new, \r\nbarbarous crimes that have cost the lives of thousands \r\nof martyrs and caused thousands of injuries.\r\nThe international community must therefore \r\ncondemn the war crimes and crimes against humanity \r\nbeing committed against innocent civilians. It should \r\nmake the occupying Power resume the peace process \r\nwith the goal of achieving a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace that respects the decisions of international \r\nlaw and the Arab Peace Initiative. We would like to \r\nreaffirm our full solidarity with the Palestinian people \r\nin their efforts to see the restoration of the rights that \r\nhave been stolen from them, including their independent \r\nState, with Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe ongoing cycle of violence in sisterly Syria is a \r\nsource of concern, since it continues to destabilize and \r\ndamage the entire region. Furthermore, some armed \r\nterrorist groups are exploiting the serious situation \r\nthere. That is a large-scale challenge that demands \r\nthat we all work together to find solutions, as fast as \r\npossible, in order to promote the aspirations of the \r\nSyrian people in peace and stability, while maintaining \r\nSyria’s unity and territorial integrity.\r\nIn Iraq, we are seeing the activities of Daesh, \r\nwhich is perpetrating crimes against the population \r\nirrespective of their religious and ethnic backgrounds. \r\nThat is extremely worrying, because such groups and \r\n4/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\norganizations are simply interested in acquiring greater \r\npower. They have nothing to do with the tolerant Islamic \r\nreligion or the values of the Muslim community as a \r\nwhole, which respects all the rights of others.\r\nThe events and conflicts we are seeing around \r\nthe world highlight the challenges facing the United \r\nNations. We must work to reform it so that it is able \r\nto settle conflicts and maintain international peace \r\nand security. I therefore urge that the Arab States \r\nbe given a permanent seat on the Security Council, \r\nsince the region figures so prominently in the work of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe issue of the control of nuclear weapons is \r\nurgent, since nuclear and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction are a huge threat to the peace and security \r\nof the whole world. We therefore deplore the fact that \r\nthe conference on establishing the Middle East as a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone has been repeatedly delayed, \r\ndespite the efforts and f lexibility shown by Arab \r\ncountries to convene it. We call on the great Powers to \r\nassume their responsibility to put pressure on Israel and \r\nthe other parties that are preventing the convening of a \r\nconference, whereby they are creating obstacles to the \r\nrestoration of peace and security in the Middle East and \r\nlaying the ground for an alarming arms race, which will \r\nundoubtedly have negative effects.\r\nIn conclusion, I would once again like to thank the \r\nPresident and the Secretary-General. We hope that the \r\nwork of this session will be successful and will help to \r\nmeet the hopes and aspirations of our peoples to live in \r\npeace and stability and lead a decent life.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Mohlabi Kenneth Tsekoa, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and International Relations \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Tsekoa (Lesotho): I would first like to \r\ncongratulate President Kutesa on his well-deserved \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. His distinguished career \r\nas a diplomat and leader assures us of a successful \r\nsession. I would also like to commend his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador John Ashe, for his remarkable leadership \r\nduring the previous session.\r\nOver the 69 years of its existence, the United Nations \r\nhas witnessed several changes in the configuration of \r\ninternational relations. Some were traumatic, others \r\nbenign. The survival of the Organization through \r\nall those tribulations testifies to its resilience and \r\nthe enduring validity of its mission. Today it is still \r\nconfronted by serious challenges. The continuous \r\neruption of armed conflicts throughout the world, \r\nterrorism, climate change, disease and the lingering \r\neffects of the economic and financial crises are only \r\nsome of the challenges that have remained in the \r\nforeground of international relations and preoccupied \r\nthe international community.\r\nFrom the Horn of Africa and across the Sahel \r\nregion, to the Republic of Kenya and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the continent of Africa is facing \r\na rise in terrorism. The Nigeria-based Boko Haram, \r\nAl-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Al-Shabaab in \r\nSomalia continue to pose serious threats to the peace \r\nand security of the continent. The emergence in the \r\nMiddle East and elsewhere of new extremist groups and \r\nterrorist entities, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nSyria, has not only further compounded the problem \r\nbut is a stark reminder that we must act collectively \r\nto discharge the moral responsibility resting on us to \r\nensure that people everywhere enjoy the right to peace, \r\ndevelopment and the sanctity of life.\r\nThe use of military force alone as a strategy for \r\ncombating terrorism is no longer a panacea for that \r\nmenace. Terrorism requires a holistic approach that \r\naddresses the root causes of the scourge. The resolution \r\nof international disputes based on dialogue, justice and \r\nthe equality of all States must be at the heart of that \r\nstrategy if it is to succeed.\r\nThe recurring bloody conflict between Israel and \r\nPalestine continues to weigh heavily on the conscience \r\nof all humankind. Recent developments in that region \r\nhave cast a shadow on the future that had seemed \r\nto hold out the promise of a negotiated settlement. \r\nUnprecedented impunity and the disproportionate \r\nuse of force by the parties involved call into question \r\nour very claim to be a civilization. Turning United \r\nNations shelters into combat zones and killing the \r\ninnocent children, men and women who take refuge in \r\nthem is a shameful act that must be condemned in the \r\nstrongest terms possible. Lesotho endorses the recent \r\nHuman Rights Council resolution S-21/1, demanding \r\nthat the massacres of innocent Palestinian civilians be \r\ninvestigated by an independent commission and that \r\nthose responsible be held accountable.\r\nLet us not forget that in 2005 we unanimously \r\nadopted the principle of the responsibility to protect \r\n(see resolution 60/1, paragraphs 138-140) in order \r\nto safeguard innocent civilians from war crimes, \r\n14-55191 5/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\ngenocide, mass atrocities and ethnic cleansing. Indeed, \r\nthe Security Council has reaffirmed that principle in \r\nseveral conflicts around the world and in some instances \r\nhas authorized military intervention.\r\nUnfortunately, in the case of the slaughter of \r\nthousands of Palestinian civilians, the Council has \r\nshied away from invoking the principle of responsibility \r\nto protect. Instead, it took comfort in issuing a \r\npresidential statement that glaringly fails to reiterate \r\naccountability for the war crimes committed. Civilians \r\nin Gaza deserve the protection that Israelis in Tel \r\nAviv are afforded under international law. We call on \r\nIsrael — as we have always done in the past — to fully \r\ncomply with its obligations under the relevant Security \r\nCouncil and General Assembly resolutions. That is the \r\nonly plausible route to lasting peace.\r\nThe world has long come to terms with the dangers \r\nto humanity posed by the possession of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. That is why Lesotho continues to \r\nadvocate for total abolition and destruction of all \r\nnuclear weapons. Those weapons have no place in \r\nmodern-day civilized society, hence the call for a \r\nconvention to ban them all. While working towards \r\nthat goal, we must emphasize that full compliance with \r\nthe provisions of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons is critical. By the same token, \r\nwe call for the establishment of a Middle East zone \r\nfree of nuclear weapons, in accordance with the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nIt is unacceptable that the United Nations of today \r\nstill ref lects the 1945 architecture of the world as seen \r\nby the victors of the Second World War. The reform of \r\nthe United Nations, including the Security Council, can \r\nno longer be delayed. A reformed, transparent and more \r\ndemocratic United Nations is necessary for preserving \r\ninternational peace and security and for confronting \r\nthe challenges of development. All Member States need \r\nto garner the necessary political will to advance the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. Let us make the sixth-ninth session one for \r\ndecisive action.\r\nThe representatives who gathered in San Francisco \r\nto finalize the Charter of the United Nations dreamed of \r\na world of peace and shared prosperity. They renounced \r\na vision of a world in which some unilaterally imposed \r\neconomic sanctions and financial blockades against \r\nothers, or one in which peoples were denied their right \r\nto self-determination or were subjected to occupation, \r\nas is the case in Cuba, Palestine and Western Sahara. \r\nWe have to remove those dark spots on the history of \r\nour time by allowing the letter and spirit of the Charter \r\nto guide our actions.\r\nThe theme chosen for our general debate, \r\n“Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda”, could not be more \r\nrelevant at the current international juncture. The \r\nroad towards the achievement of all the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has been rough, with some \r\ncountries reporting relative success in reducing poverty \r\nand hunger, markedly increasing school enrolment, \r\nreducing child mortality, improving maternal health \r\nand combating HIV/AIDS. However, the challenges \r\nremain most daunting in the least developed countries, \r\nlandlocked developing countries, some small island \r\ndeveloping States and countries in, or emerging from, \r\nconflict.\r\nFor our part, in Lesotho we have made some \r\nprogress towards achieving at least two of the eight \r\nMDGs, namely, universal primary education, and \r\npromoting gender equality and empowering women. \r\nWe still face a long and uphill journey to reach a life \r\nof dignity for all. HIV and AIDS still pose a serious \r\nthreat to us. The untold miseries brought about by that \r\nscourge are known to all of us. Africa is more vulnerable \r\nto that threat because of the worsening poverty and \r\nunemployment. Sadly, new, incurable pandemics such \r\nas Ebola have emerged, wreaking havoc in sister African \r\ncountries and overwhelming their health systems. The \r\nworld must mobilize resources and energy to help the \r\naffected countries of West Africa fight the pandemic \r\nand to abolish it in the long term.\r\nOur quest to pursue a sustainable future for \r\nall must never wane as we step into the new era and \r\nembark on the road map of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. We need to formulate a new set of universal \r\nsustainable development goals that are concise and \r\nstrong with regard to the means of implementation. It is \r\nimportant to emphasize national ownership and respect \r\nfor national conditions in each Member State and to \r\ntake advantage of global diversity so that we can attain \r\nour development aspirations.\r\nAs we continue with intergovernmental discussions \r\nleading up to the Third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, which will be held \r\nin Addis Ababa in July 2015, we must be guided by \r\nthe spirit of frankness and mutual understanding, \r\nwithout the acrimony that often characterizes \r\n6/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\nour intergovernmental deliberations. It is equally \r\nimportant to emphasize that advancing the rule of law \r\nat the national and international levels is essential for \r\nrealizing sustainable development, eradicating poverty \r\nand protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nLesotho is by no means an exception in that regard.\r\nA few days ago, the Climate Summit provided \r\nus with an opportunity once again to reaffirm our \r\ncollective resolve to implement measures that can \r\nsignificantly address climate change. We disagreed for \r\nfar too long, until we were confronted by the glaring and \r\ncompelling scientific evidence that the link between \r\nglobal warming and human activity is indisputable. \r\nSadly, catastrophes have begun to hit, mostly affecting \r\nthe poorest and most vulnerable countries.\r\nMy country is one of the worst affected by climate \r\nchange. In recent years, Lesotho has faced unsettling \r\ndevelopment challenges due to the effects of climate \r\nchange. The effects of increasing extreme weather \r\npatterns such as early frost, droughts, desertification \r\nand degradation of arable land compound the challenges \r\nthat we are already facing. Livelihoods of societies are \r\nstif led, and economies and ways of life are negatively \r\naffected.\r\nWhile we appreciate that there are resources aimed \r\nat helping developing countries to mitigate and adapt \r\nto the impacts of climate change, we are concerned \r\nthat such funds are difficult to access. The global \r\nclimate-finance architecture is complex, with variable \r\nstructures of governance and modalities. Some finance \r\nis channelled through multilateral agencies, sometimes \r\neven outside the funding mechanisms of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nand some flows through bilateral development- \r\nassistance institutions, thereby making coordination \r\nvery difficult. Lesotho calls on the international \r\ncommunity and our development partners to simplify \r\nthe accessibility of funds earmarked for climate change \r\ninitiatives if we are to make an impact on the ground.\r\nIn conclusion, let me point out that the regime of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations has so far done its part in \r\npreventing a third world war, thereby fulfilling one of \r\nthe dreams of the architects of our beloved Organization. \r\nThe continued success and the relevance of the United \r\nNations in the new millennium will depend, in large \r\nmeasure, on its capacity for self-renewal in readiness to \r\nmeet modern-day challenges.\r\nWe, the United Nations, should continue to be \r\nthe voice of the voiceless and the best hope for all \r\nhumankind. Now is the time for leaders everywhere to \r\njoin the race for transformative action that can drive \r\npeace, democracy, respect for human rights and the rule \r\nof law, human dignity, economic competitiveness and \r\nsustainable prosperity for all. Lesotho will and must \r\ncontinue to be a persistent and resilient part of that \r\ninitiative.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Jean-Paul Adam, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Seychelles.\r\nMr. Adam (Seychelles): It gives me great pleasure \r\nto begin this address with warm congratulations to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \r\nalso wish to congratulate His Excellency Mr. John Ashe \r\non his inspiring leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session.\r\nThis year, we marked the 100th anniversary of the \r\nFirst World War. Our forefathers in 1918 called that \r\nWar the war to end all wars, because they knew, as we \r\nknow today, that no society can aspire to development \r\nand a better way of life without peace. At that time, \r\nmany Seychellois people gave their lives to defend that \r\nideal. Despite being one of the smallest nations in the \r\nworld, geographically far removed from the centres of \r\npower and of conflict, our people have always known \r\nthat we cannot be at peace if the world is not at peace. \r\nI take this opportunity to salute those who made the \r\nultimate sacrifice in those turbulent times of 1914 and \r\nthose islanders who showed that no matter how small \r\nwe may be, we can make a meaningful contribution.\r\nHowever, the turbulent events that have unfolded \r\nbefore our eyes during the course of 2014 have shown \r\nvery clearly that the world is not at peace. The heinous \r\nand murderous acts of global terrorist activities in \r\nrecent weeks remind us of the increasing threat posed \r\nby terrorism and of the pain that it brings to innocent \r\nvictims. That is coupled with a multiplication of \r\nregional conflicts and instability within States.\r\nIn order to build peace, we must reinforce our \r\ncommitment to multilateralism through the United \r\nNations, while also ensuring that we accord the highest \r\npriority to more inclusive and effective development. \r\nIn that context, I commend the President for placing the \r\ndiscussion in this year’s general debate under the banner \r\nof “Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\n14-55191 7/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\npost-2015 development agenda”. Seychelles takes \r\npride in having achieved most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and continues to impart greater \r\nimpetus to ensure that the remaining challenges are \r\neffectively dealt with by 2015.\r\nFor small island developing States (SIDS), the \r\nsustainable development goals are essential to allow \r\nfor the implementation of development transformation. \r\nWe must recognize that the current development \r\nframework of the majority of development institutions \r\nis still not favourable to the development of SIDS. Most \r\ndevelopment gains are still assessed ultimately through \r\ngross domestic product (GDP) per capita measurements, \r\nwhich do not adequately identify the threats to human \r\ndevelopment or the opportunities that exist, especially \r\nfor small island States.\r\nSeychelles warmly welcomes the outcomes of \r\nthe Third International Conference on Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, held in Apia, and would particularly \r\nlike to thank the Government and people of Samoa for \r\ntheir leadership in establishing a platform for action to \r\nsupport the development of SIDS.\r\nSeychelles has championed three priorities that are \r\noutcomes of that conference. The first is the need for a \r\nvulnerability index to be used as a more effective tool \r\nfor addressing the development needs of SIDS than \r\nGDP per capita. The second is the need to address the \r\ndebilitating debt of SIDS through innovations, such as \r\ndebt for climate change adaptation swaps. The third \r\npriority is the need to build opportunities for SIDS \r\non the basis of their strengths, not their weaknesses; \r\nhence, the need to support a blue economy approach, \r\nwhereby SIDS can better utilize their oceanic potential \r\nand whereby we can be large-ocean nations.\r\nThose three priorities are not specific only to \r\nSIDS. The development challenges of SIDS highlight \r\nthe deficiencies of the development framework for \r\nall developing nations. A vulnerability index allows \r\nus to target those areas that place our societies at \r\nrisk. An effective vulnerability index adopted by \r\nthe United Nations will allow us to better target the \r\ndiverse needs of SIDS, least developed countries and \r\nlandlocked countries, as well as States threatened by \r\ndesertification or those most prone to natural disasters. \r\nIt is an inclusive view of development.\r\nOwnership of the blue economy also widens \r\ndevelopment perspectives for our whole planet. It is \r\nhigh time that we realize the immense potential of \r\nour oceans. We cannot apply the principles of a green \r\neconomy and of sustainable development without \r\nrecognizing that we are applying them in a blue world, \r\nfor over 70 per cent of our planet is covered by oceans \r\nand seas. For developing nations, the ocean is a shared \r\nopportunity. It is therefore essential that we address \r\nour oceans, and the challenges therein appropriately, \r\nthrough a stand-alone sustainable development goal on \r\noceans.\r\nMr. Dabbashi (Libya), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe right to development belongs to us all. True \r\ndevelopment is therefore not only about economic \r\ngrowth or the total wealth that a country can create. \r\nIt is about the constant improvement that we need for \r\nthe well-being of people. It is about being able to build \r\na future for our children based on shared opportunity. \r\nIn that vein, I reiterate the call that the international \r\ncommunity not spare any effort in helping the nations \r\nof West Africa to overcome the Ebola pandemic, which \r\nis a health issue of international concern. Ensuring \r\nthat the affected communities have access to the right \r\nmedical support will save lives not only in West Africa \r\nbut across the world. Ebola is not just an African \r\nproblem. It is a global problem.\r\nWe also remain preoccupied by the conclusions of \r\nthe Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental \r\nPanel on Climate Change. That is why SIDS have \r\ncontinuously underlined the scientific research being \r\nconducted on climate change, which shows that a \r\nwarming of even 1.5°C will have a negative impact \r\non all countries, even if islands are on the front line. \r\nHowever, the science also tells us that we still have a \r\nwindow where we can act decisively and effectively.\r\nA legally binding agreement that sets a course for \r\nincreases of no more than 2°C is achievable, but all \r\ncountries, large or small, must make it happen. It is not a \r\nsubject that we can leave aside to take up later, to debate \r\nat a later date. We call on all partners to ensure that \r\nthe upcoming Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nwhich will meet in Lima, sets the stage for concluding \r\na meaningful and legally binding agreement in Paris in \r\n2015.\r\nI would also like to reiterate the importance \r\nof fulfilling commitments to jointly mobilize \r\nover $100 billion annually by 2020 for the full \r\noperationalization of the Green Climate Fund, which \r\n8/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\nshould be capitalized as soon as possible. I also \r\nunderline the importance of ensuring that the most \r\nvulnerable, in particular SIDS and African nations, \r\nhave access to the appropriate resources as quickly \r\nas possible. Further, we call for SIDS to be part of the \r\ndecision-makers on issues of climate change and to be \r\nallocated a permanent seat on the Executive Committee \r\nof the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and \r\nDamage associated with Climate Change Impacts.\r\nSeychelles will also continue to advocate for a \r\nsolution to the debt trap in which many of us, especially \r\nSIDS, find ourselves. A solution that Seychelles \r\nhas brought forward in partnership with the Nature \r\nConservancy, an international non-governmental \r\norganization, is proposals for debt-for-adaptation \r\nswaps. SIDS are often constrained in their development \r\nbecause of large debt-to-GDP ratios. Transferring \r\nthat debt into climate change adaptation projects \r\nwill address the SIDS need for greater f lexibility in \r\naddressing their development challenges while also \r\nmaking a real impact in terms of building climate \r\nchange resilience by creating marine protected areas, \r\nnot only locally, but globally. That concept will also \r\nallow for the application of climate change funding in \r\norder to achieve leverage for adaptation projects while \r\nreducing financial barriers for small island developing \r\nStates.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nFaced with the challenges of security, transnational \r\ncrime and extremism, the United Nations requires \r\nsignificant reform and must rise above its divisions \r\nto help build a world in which human beings can live, \r\nwherever they are, in dignity and free from want and \r\nfear. More than ever, it is necessary to encourage the \r\nsearch for collective solutions to address all sorts of \r\nphenomenon that undermine the balance of our world.\r\nThat is the sense that guides every action of \r\nmy country. Seychelles is indeed ready to meet the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century in a spirit of \r\nopenness and dialogue with all peoples, for a world \r\nof peace and human brotherhood. We are working in \r\nAfrica, particularly in the Indian Ocean, with a view to \r\nthe region becoming one of shared peaceful, democratic \r\nand prosperous development.\r\nThe Indian Ocean region is grateful to the United \r\nNations, and the Seychelles once again thanks its \r\nspecialized agencies, as well as our various partners, for \r\nthe invaluable role each one has played and still plays in \r\nthe fight against maritime piracy, which has already had \r\na deep impact on our development plans. Statistics show \r\nthat today maritime piracy has declined, but that hardly \r\nindicates that that threat has disappeared. Therefore, \r\nwe must remain vigilant, and we still need the support \r\nof all to help dispel the profound aftereffects it has left \r\nfor our economy. Over the years, maritime piracy has \r\nhad serious repercussions on fishing, tourism, shipping \r\nand port services. Seychelles continues to work in \r\nharmony with all its partners, since any slackening in \r\nthe face of that unpredictable phenomenon could have \r\nconsequences.\r\nThe Seychelles is actively involved with partners \r\nin our region and beyond to better target organizers \r\nof cross-border trafficking in the Indian Ocean zone. \r\nWe have established a regional information centre that \r\nallows better coordination between our region’s forces \r\nand also aims to better manage the monitoring and \r\nprotecting of our shared maritime space against the \r\nshared threats, whether piracy, narcotics trafficking or \r\nillegal fishing.\r\nIn the same vein, the Seychelles will continue to \r\nsupport the Security Council decision to strengthen \r\nthe United Nations-African Union partnership in \r\nSomalia. It is a difficult task, for which I wish to \r\naffirm our solidarity with the African and United \r\nNations staff involved. I take the opportunity to urge \r\nthe international community to continue supporting \r\nefforts to restore peace and reconciliation in Somalia. \r\nThe international community must not lose patience \r\nin view of the mixed results achieved so far. For our \r\npart, we have taken action bilaterally and with regional \r\nand multilateral partners to help Somalia strengthen its \r\ncapacities in areas such as fisheries management and \r\ndevelopment. The United Nations must always show the \r\nway and inspire the necessary efforts to bring together \r\nthe means necessary in the struggle and to coordinate \r\nthem with the States concerned.\r\nSeychelles also expresses solidarity with all \r\nAfrican countries affected by conflict or instability. \r\nWe are committed to working together so that we can \r\nbuild together, in the African Union, the transformative \r\nAfrica that we foresee through our 2063 strategy.\r\nSeychelles, like all African countries, also \r\nexpresses solidarity with the Palestinian people, given \r\nthe challenges of the continuing conflict in the Middle \r\nEast, and we reiterate our wish for peace between the \r\ntwo neighbouring States based on the 1967 borders.\r\n14-55191 9/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\nWe also take the opportunity to recall the \r\nimportance of lifting the economic embargo against \r\nCuba, an island country that depends on trade access to \r\nbetter support its development, as all island States do.\r\nAll those problems and challenges justify the United \r\nNations remaining the leaven of international peace \r\nand security, but also and especially the conscience \r\nof humanity. Here I commend the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his remarkable work at the head \r\nof our Organization at a time when human history is \r\nfacing enormous challenges. Indeed, much remains to \r\nbe done, but optimism remains, for the helm is in good \r\nhands. The United Nations will effectively discharge its \r\nmission if all the nations that gave rise to it, large and \r\nsmall, provide it with the necessary means and entrust \r\nit with the responsibility for carrying out actions in the \r\nservice of humanity. Seychelles, for its part, remains \r\nready to play its role to its full capacity, in this noble \r\nand exciting mission.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Patrice Nisbett, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Homeland Security, Labour, Justice \r\nand Legal Affairs of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Nisbett (Saint Kitts and Nevis): It is indeed \r\nan honour for me to address this body for the first time \r\nsince assuming the portfolio of Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs a little over one year ago. I take pleasure in \r\nsharing the perspectives of the Government of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis on matters before the General Assembly \r\nduring its sixty-ninth session.\r\nAllow me to start by congratulating Mr. Kutesa on \r\nhis election to the office of President of the General \r\nAssembly, to steer the course of the Assembly during \r\nthis session. Indeed, his sterling contribution in \r\nhis native Uganda, where he serves as Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, and his efforts at strengthening the \r\nAfrican Union have prepared him for the challenging \r\ntask of finalizing the development of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nMy delegation wishes to commend his predecessor, \r\nMr. John Ashe of Antigua and Barbuda, for his \r\nleadership in presiding over the Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session. His focus on the development of the \r\nsustainable development goals and other issues of \r\nimportance to small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nand developing countries in particular is worthy of high \r\ncommendation.\r\nThe theme of the sixty-ninth session, “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”, is quite timely as we enter a new \r\ndispensation that reflects global priorities that were not \r\ncontemplated at the time the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) were conceptualized leading up to \r\nthe year 2000. As we work on implementing the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, we must ensure \r\nthat the 17 sustainable development goals recently \r\nformulated are effective in building on the foundation \r\nlaid by the Millennium Development Goals. It is my \r\ndelegation’s hope that the agenda as developed will be \r\ntransformative in nature, with a high degree of success \r\nin its overarching objectives — the eradication of \r\npoverty and hunger, and the promotion of sustained and \r\ninclusive economic growth.\r\nWe are mindful that MDG 8, which calls for the \r\nstrengthening of global partnerships, remains part of \r\nthe unfinished business of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals established at the Millennium Summit in 2000. It \r\nis therefore highly important that we take great care in \r\nensuring that the first 16 sustainable development goals \r\nare buttressed by a robust suite of implementation tools \r\nthat will effectively serve as the catalyst for achieving \r\nsuccess in the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMy delegation can never overemphasize the \r\nimportance of rendering effective and operational Goal \r\n17, which calls for the strengthening of the means of \r\nimplementation and the revitalization of the global \r\npartnership for sustainable development. We are \r\ntherefore heartened by the President’s expressed plan to \r\nconvene three high-level thematic debates and one high-\r\nlevel event geared towards, inter alia, strengthening the \r\nmeans of implementation in order to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in its three dimensions.\r\nWe pay keen attention to the first event, the \r\ndebate on the means of implementation. We are of \r\nthe view that achieving sustainable development will \r\nrequire mobilization and the effective use of financial \r\nresources and technology development and transfer, \r\nin addition to capacity-building at all levels. It will \r\nalso entail increased investment in the social sectors, \r\ninfrastructure, community development, climate \r\nfinancing and the protection of global common goods.\r\nThe key question before us in relation to the means \r\nof implementation is how we mobilize the significant \r\nresources that will be needed to turn the aspirations \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda into tangible \r\n10/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\noutcomes. I wish to pledge my Government’s support \r\nin advancing the basic thrust of the President’s tenure. \r\nA strengthened global partnership should foster close \r\ncollaboration between and among Governments, \r\nprovide for an increased role of the private sector, \r\nensure a fair international trading regime, and foster \r\nnational and foreign direct investments.\r\nMy Government wishes to reiterate its firm \r\ncommitment to doing its part to ensure that we \r\nachieve the goals developed to sustain economic and \r\nsocial development in a manner that will preserve \r\nthe environment and ensure stable, safe and peaceful \r\nsocieties. Since our last address to this body, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis has solidified its position as a leader in \r\nthe Caribbean in attracting foreign direct investment, \r\nspecifically in its tourism infrastructure, and \r\nbuilding its industrial base in the light manufacturing \r\nsector — electronics and electrical components. We have \r\nalso successfully forged public-private partnerships in \r\nrenewable-energy ventures providing sustained growth \r\nfor our economy.\r\nOne of the peculiar vulnerabilities of small island \r\ndeveloping States such as Saint Kitts and Nevis is \r\nour susceptibility to economic and external shocks, \r\nwhich results in a state of high indebtedness. It is \r\nno secret that high public debt affects the ability of \r\nGovernments to achieve sustainable development in all \r\nits dimensions. In the area of economic sustainability, \r\nwe developed in 2011 and successfully implemented \r\na comprehensive approach to the management of our \r\nnational debt. Our plan included debt restructuring \r\nwith international financial institutions, an exchange \r\noffer for government bonds, the curtailment of public \r\nborrowing to sustainable levels and a creative land-for-\r\ndebt swap initiative.\r\nI am pleased to report that by the end of June, we \r\nhad successfully reduced the ratio of our debt to gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) by 50 percentage points, from \r\nover 145 per cent pre-restructuring to 95 per cent now. \r\nI am even more pleased to report that our debt-to-GDP \r\nratio is projected to decline further, to 85 per cent by the \r\nend of 2014. In spite of our fiscal discipline, however, \r\nit is important for us to be mindful of the fact that one \r\nsevere climate event can erase the gains achieved, \r\neffectively sending us into a vicious cycle that makes \r\nit difficult if not impossible to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment on the economic front.\r\nAt this juncture, I would be remiss if I failed to \r\necho the call for a new paradigm for the assessment \r\nused in the policy of graduation, which currently uses \r\nthe narrow policy of per capita gross national income \r\nto confer middle-income and high-income status on \r\ndeveloping countries. Saint Kitts and Nevis is of the \r\nview that that measure is grossly inadequate and needs \r\nto take into account the peculiar vulnerabilities of \r\nSIDS. We commend the Commonwealth secretariat \r\nfor the innovative work it has been spearheading to \r\nencourage leading international financial institutions \r\nto accept a broader matrix, including the vulnerability \r\nindex, to correctly assess the true economic situation of \r\nSIDS such as Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nI must emphasize that graduation to a higher \r\nincome category makes it difficult to access resources \r\nto sustain our economic, social and environmental \r\npolicy objectives. Borrowing funds at a high rate on \r\nthe international market serves only to perpetuate the \r\nvicious cycle of debt and threatens our sustainable \r\ndevelopment. That runs contrary to the goals and \r\nobjectives of the post-2015 development agenda. In \r\nthat connection, I call on the international community, \r\nincluding the leading international financial \r\ninstitutions, to broaden the scope of the assessment of \r\nSIDS in order to avoid creating scenarios where debt \r\nsustainability measures undertaken at the national \r\nlevel are undermined by the policies of international \r\ninstitutions. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands ready to work \r\nwith the international community by contributing its \r\nideas to the debate in order to ensure a most favourable \r\noutcome.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that a nation’s wealth \r\nlies in the health of its people — its productive sector. \r\nWe continue to wrestle with the high incidence of \r\nnon-communicable diseases (NCDs) in our country \r\nand region. We wish to reiterate our call for a strong \r\nglobal response to combating the high incidence of \r\nnon-communicable diseases, in particular in developing \r\ncountries. In our last statement to this very body (see \r\nA/68/PV.15), our Prime Minister stressed the need for \r\nthis international body to keep on the front burner a \r\npractical strategy to address the high incidence of \r\nNCDs within our region and throughout the world. \r\nIn that connection, I wish to commend the outgoing \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Ambassador John \r\nAshe, for convening a number of events focusing on \r\nthat matter of great importance to my delegation.\r\nIt is our hope that the final report on the \r\ninformal interactive hearings with non-governmental \r\norganizations, civil-society organizations, the private \r\n14-55191 11/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\nsector and academia on the prevention and control of \r\nNCDs, which was held in June 2014, will serve to build \r\non the outcome of the initiatives resulting from the \r\nHigh-level Meeting on Non-communicable Diseases, \r\nheld in September 2011 during the Assembly’s sixty-\r\nsixth session, and the work conducted during the \r\nfollowing session.\r\nMy delegation is indeed pleased to see the inclusion \r\nof non-communicable diseases in the goals and targets \r\nfor sustainable development as part of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. We support the goal to ensure \r\nhealthy lives and promote well-being for all at all \r\nages. We also support the target to reduce by one third \r\npremature mortality from non-communicable diseases \r\nthrough prevention and treatment, and to promote \r\nmental health and well-being by 2030. We look to \r\nthe various specialized bodies of this international \r\nOrganization for guidance and support as we seek to \r\nmeet the targets and indicators under that and all goals \r\ndeveloped as part of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nWe reiterate the call for the strengthening of the means \r\nof implementation of the goals and targets and for the \r\nrevitalization of the global partnership for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nClimate change remains more than an environmental \r\nconcern for small island developing States such as Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis. We regard it more as a threat to our \r\nexistence. The adverse effects of climate change are well \r\nknown: persistent adverse weather conditions, f loods, \r\nextended droughts and rising sea levels. My delegation \r\nis convinced of the need to preserve our planet Earth \r\nfor ourselves and generations yet unborn. We have an \r\nobligation to combat climate change through mitigation \r\nand adaptation measures.\r\nClimate change financing and technology transfer \r\nwill be pivotal to the success of that objective. We \r\nurge widespread acceptance by the international \r\ncommunity of creative initiatives such as debt swap \r\nfor climate adaptation and mitigation. My Government \r\nis convinced that such proposals, developed with \r\nassistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat, provide \r\nSIDS with a greater degree of f lexibility as we try to \r\nachieve sustainable development. We welcome the \r\ncommitment of the President of the General Assembly \r\nto provide appropriate impetus and momentum to the \r\nongoing process under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to reach a \r\nglobal agreement on climate change by 2015.\r\nMaintaining peace and security remains one of \r\nthe main priorities of the United Nations. That ideal \r\nis captured in the post-2015 development agenda as \r\nsustainable development goal 16, to achieve peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies and the rule of law and to build \r\neffective and capable institutions. I am pleased to \r\nreport that at the national level we have implemented \r\nstrategies that have brought a reduction in violent crime \r\nand strengthened institutions that sustain peaceful and \r\ninclusive societies. We are grateful to our development \r\npartners — the Governments of the United States of \r\nAmerica, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Canada, \r\nthe European Union, and the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan — for their invaluable assistance in that regard.\r\nThirty-one years ago, our new nation forged a \r\nstrategic and mutually beneficial relationship with \r\nthe Republic of China on Taiwan. That relationship \r\nhas grown by leaps and bounds, and it touches all \r\nthree dimensions of sustainable development. As \r\nthe dialogue continues on the implementation of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nregards itself suitably qualified to speak on the valuable \r\ncontribution which the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\ncan make to the international community.\r\nAt the recent SIDS Conference in Samoa, our \r\nPrime Minister had the privilege to speak of the value \r\nof the partnership established with the Government \r\nand private sector of Taiwan in implementing a number \r\nof projects in renewable energy, specifically the \r\nestablishment of a solar panel manufacturing plant and \r\nthe outfitting of Government buildings and street lights \r\nwith solar panels. The latter project will assist us in \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis to achieve the goal of ensuring \r\naccess to affordable, reliable and modern energy \r\nservices for all.\r\nFor many years, our Government has called for \r\nthe international community to allow the Republic \r\nof China on Taiwan to participate in the work of the \r\norgans of the United Nations system. That call is by \r\nno means arbitrary in nature. It has resulted from \r\nour partnership in numerous development initiatives \r\nacross the sustainable development spectrum. Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis is therefore pleased to note that Taiwan \r\nwas recently invited to attend the Assembly of the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization for the first \r\ntime since 1971. We are equally pleased to note the \r\nparticipation of Taiwan in the World Health Assembly \r\nand to offer our commendation to the Government and \r\n12/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\npeople of Taiwan for sharing their expertise in the fields \r\nof medicine and civil aviation safety.\r\nAt this juncture, we are convinced that the time \r\nis right for that spirit of understanding and inclusion \r\nto extend to the area of the ongoing negotiations \r\nin the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the United Nations Environment \r\nAssembly. My Government is equally convinced that \r\nthe experiences gained by Taiwan in its strategy for \r\nbuilding environmental and economic resilience can be \r\nshared with the international community through the \r\nUNFCCC.\r\nWhile the international community is focused \r\non maintaining peace and security, we are pleased to \r\nunderscore the active role played by the Government \r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan in promoting peace \r\nand security across the Taiwan Strait and for proposing \r\nthe East China Sea Peace Initiative, thus demonstrating \r\nits commitment to international peace and security.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis remains \r\nconcerned by the decades-old unilateral trade embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba. That relic of the Cold War runs \r\ncounter to the principles of international law, principles \r\nwhich undergird the United Nations system. We stand \r\nby our sister nations in the Caribbean Community and \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and reiterate our call for \r\ncreative ways to resolve that perennial issue, which \r\nadversely affects the tenor of hemispheric relations.\r\nMy delegation recognizes the challenging weeks \r\nand months ahead as we prepare in earnest to implement \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. We offer our fullest \r\nsupport in that regard. Such support is critical to the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the development agenda. \r\nMay we, as an international community, redouble our \r\nefforts in a manner that will redound to the benefit of \r\ndeveloped and developing countries alike.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Robert Dussey, Minister of State \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the \r\nTogolese Republic.\r\nMr. Dussey (Togo) (spoke in French): I would like \r\nto extend to the President, on behalf of the people and \r\nGovernment of Togo, as well as on my own behalf, our \r\nwarmest congratulations on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to reiterate to \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, my country’s \r\nsincere congratulations on and encouragement for \r\nhis efforts to enable our Organization to meet the \r\nchallenges facing our world.\r\nBy giving the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly the theme “Delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative post-2015 development agenda”, the \r\nPresident wished to remind Member States of their \r\nresponsibility to spare no effort in defining, as we \r\nlook ahead in the context of the post-2015 period, a \r\ndevelopment agenda commensurate with the challenges \r\nfacing the world. Indeed, it is undeniable that defining \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) has been \r\nbeneficial to humankind. While not all of those goals \r\nwill be achieved by all our States, our commitment to \r\nworking together to attain them has enabled us to make \r\nnotable progress towards each of the Goals throughout \r\nthe world. The new development agenda should therefore \r\nprovide States with an appropriate road map that takes \r\ninto account the diversity and complexity of situations \r\nand developments resulting from the experience gained \r\nin implementing the MDGs.\r\nFor its part, the Togolese Government remains \r\ndetermined and mobilized to continue and to scale up \r\nthe necessary efforts in the context of a new post-2015 \r\ndevelopment programme with a view to a more tangible \r\nreduction in the level of poverty in our country. In recent \r\nyears, the incidence of poverty has in fact been reduced \r\nby three points in Togo. That trend is supported by an \r\nimprovement in the business climate that provides good \r\nprospects for increasing the success of the job creation \r\nprogrammes being implemented in the country for the \r\nbenefit of young people.\r\nIn that regard, we note, among other elements, the \r\npositive impact as a result of conducting several job \r\ncreation and grass-roots development programmes. In \r\nthe same spirit, we have established the National Fund \r\nfor Inclusive Finance, whose goal is to make financial \r\nservices accessible to the most vulnerable people, in \r\nparticular women, who are generally excluded from \r\naccess to credit from traditional financial institutions.\r\nIn the field of agriculture, Togo continues to \r\ndevelop the National Agricultural Investment and Food \r\nSecurity Programme. Its implementation has led not \r\nonly to satisfactory results in the context of food self-\r\nsufficiency but also to agricultural surpluses for several \r\ncrop years, particularly that of 2013/14.\r\nIn terms of health, encouraging results have been \r\nachieved in reducing the maternal and infant mortality \r\n14-55191 13/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\nrates and in combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis.\r\nWith regard to the preservation of the environment \r\nand improvement in living conditions, robust actions \r\nhave significantly increased the level of access to \r\nsanitation and clean water. Moreover, the Government \r\nhas stepped up its adaptation efforts to curb the impact \r\nof climate change, in particular, with regard to disasters \r\ncaused by economic imbalance, which undermines the \r\nwell-being of our citizens. Our country is actively \r\nstrengthening the institutional mechanism for disaster \r\nmanagement. Togo has increased its contribution to \r\nthe protection of world heritage and to international \r\nsecurity through significant efforts in its resolute \r\nfight against the trafficking of protected species, as \r\nevidenced by the neutralization of several networks and \r\nthe seizure of large quantities of ivory.\r\nThe forward-looking vision of Togo as a country \r\nable to ensure and take ownership of its development in \r\nall respects has led the Government to initiate Vision \r\nTogo 2030. Launched in April, that initiative is based \r\non a participatory approach. It should ultimately, with \r\nthe accelerated growth and job creation strategy, allow \r\nmy country to better ensure its achievement of the \r\nMDGs and the post-2015 development agenda, which \r\nwe wholeheartedly desire. I would like to thank the \r\nentire United Nations system and all the countries that \r\nhave helped us to achieve the progress made.\r\nThe situation of chronic instability prevailing in \r\nAfrica today, in particular in the Sahel-Sahara region, \r\nis of concern. With its experience as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, on which it served \r\nin 2012 and 2013, my country, Togo, is now more \r\ncertain than ever that our agenda for peace and the new \r\narchitecture for international security must reflect the \r\nnew situation of the regionalization of conflicts.\r\nUnfortunately, another factor that further threatens \r\nthe survival of States and their development efforts is \r\nterrorism. In Africa, for example, Boko Haram and \r\nAl-Shabaab frequently carry out acts that destabilize \r\nbrother countries, such as Nigeria, Cameroon, Somalia \r\nand Kenya. Nevertheless, my country welcomes the joint \r\nefforts of the international community, which helped \r\nto thwart the armed terrorist groups, in particular in \r\nSomalia and Mali. We truly appreciate the efforts of \r\nthe French Government to remain engaged in the Sahel \r\nregion so as to continue the fight against terrorists \r\nalongside African countries in Operation Barkhane. \r\nHowever, it is important that such efforts continue and \r\nstrengthen and that the international community spare \r\nno effort in supporting the affected African countries, \r\njust as it has mobilized to counter the spread of terrorism \r\nin Iraq, Syria and elsewhere in the world.\r\nBeyond the effective control of borders, in vast \r\ngeographical areas such as the Sahel, which in recent \r\nyears has mobilized the international community to fight \r\nagainst terrorism, it is, in our view, equally essential to \r\nfurther secure our coasts in order to eradicate, with the \r\nsame determination, maritime piracy.\r\nIn that spirit, mindful of the stakes involved, Togo \r\ntook the initiative to host an international conference \r\non maritime security and economic development \r\nin Africa in Lomé in 2015 under the auspices of the \r\nAfrican Union. Togo seeks to play a leading role in \r\nproviding, with the support of all like-minded partners, \r\na framework to implement measures that have been \r\nrecommended on various occasions to make the \r\nAfrican coast a key space for international trade, free \r\nof organized predators, who instil fear along our coasts.\r\nWith regard to the promotion of peace, stability and \r\nsecurity in our countries, the deteriorating situation \r\nin the Central African Republic, Libya, South Sudan, \r\nSyria, Palestine, Ukraine and elsewhere in the world \r\nis of the gravest concern to us owing to the harmful \r\nconsequences. Such repercussions are likely to call into \r\nquestion the very existence of those countries and to \r\ndestroy their precious development efforts.\r\nMy country, Togo, has recovered stability. It is \r\nmoving forward towards a new horizon with renewed \r\nconfidence. The daughters and sons of Togo have now \r\nchosen to build the future in a climate of peace and \r\nnational harmony. Election after election, Togolese \r\ndemocracy is being built and strengthened through \r\ndialogue and consultation. It is being established with \r\nfunctioning institutions, with the support and vigilance \r\nof a determined civil society and all citizens, who are \r\nmore aware than ever of the remaining challenges to \r\novercome in terms of democracy.\r\nThe plan for our society, which is mobilizing Togo, \r\nseeks above all to make the country an active and \r\nresponsible member of the international community, \r\ndetermined to work hand in hand with other nations, \r\nso as to systematically thwart the conduits of tension, \r\nbreak the cycle of violence everywhere and prevent \r\nentrenched insecurity. Those are prerequisites not only \r\nfor social peace but also for economic development.\r\n14/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without reminding \r\nthe Assembly of the great peril to human survival \r\nthreatening the entire African continent, and West \r\nAfrica in particular, with the outbreak of the Ebola \r\nvirus. In that regard, I would like to welcome the \r\nSecurity Council’s adoption of resolution 2177 (2014), \r\nwhich describes the disease as a threat to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nRecognizing the importance of human capital in \r\ndevelopment work, my country welcomes efforts by \r\nmultilateral and bilateral actors to stem the epidemic. \r\nWe launch an urgent appeal to the bodies of the United \r\nNations system and to States to be more concerned \r\nabout the fate of our populations, in particular, those \r\nin Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, by supporting our \r\nefforts to save the infected and prevent the spread of the \r\ndisease, which knows no boundaries.\r\nI hope that the common values  that we share and \r\naffirm resonate well beyond the confines of diplomatic \r\nnegotiations and that daily find direct and clear \r\nexpression in places where peace, security and shared \r\nprosperity are tangibly enjoyed.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the representative of Sweden.\r\nMr. Grunditz (Sweden): Let me first warmly \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session. My commendations go to His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Ashe for his remarkable leadership \r\nof the sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly.\r\nOver the past few months, we have been reminded \r\nof the challenges that we collectively face in the Middle \r\nEast, with the brutality of a terrorist organization that \r\nhas forced entire populations to f lee and sent shock \r\nwaves around the globe, in Africa, with the spread \r\nof the Ebola virus disease, and, in Europe, with the \r\ncontinued aggression by the Russian Federation against \r\nUkraine. It was in order to deal with challenges such as \r\nthose that the United Nations was created. It is because \r\nchallenges such as those continue to exist that we need \r\nstrong international cooperation with a strong United \r\nNations at its core.\r\nWe welcome the fact that the international \r\ncommunity has come together to deal with the \r\nchallenge posed by the terrorist group that calls itself \r\nthe Islamic State and to take joint action to address the \r\nthreat posed by foreign terrorist fighters. Sweden is \r\npart of that common effort. When the Iraqi Government \r\nrequested assistance in halting that terrorist group and \r\nin providing relief for its victims, Sweden was one of \r\nthe countries that responded by offering additional \r\nhumanitarian support.\r\nAt the same time, we must remember that neither \r\nhere nor elsewhere in the region can crises be resolved \r\nby humanitarian or military means alone. Political \r\nengagement is, and will remain, indispensable.\r\nWe must support the new Iraqi Government, just \r\nas we must pursue a political solution to the conflict in \r\nSyria. We must do our utmost, on both sides, to reach an \r\nagreement with Iran on its nuclear dossier. Furthermore, \r\nwe must seek a lifting of the closure regime on Gaza, \r\nas well as a restart of negotiations between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians, with the aim of ending the occupation \r\nand, at last, achieving a viable two-State solution.\r\nWe welcome the readiness displayed this week here \r\nat the United Nations to take strong collective action \r\nin support of the countries affected by the devastating \r\nEbola outbreak in West Africa. Sweden, together \r\nwith others, has provided substantial support. We are \r\ncurrently considering further steps to help those who \r\nare affected.\r\nFor decades, Sweden has been a close partner to \r\nAfrica and will continue working with the growing, \r\ndemocratic and economically successful Africa that \r\nwe see emerging, as well as with the parts of that \r\ncontinent that are still struggling with poverty, conflict \r\nand disease. True to that ambition, in the conviction \r\nthat security and development belong together, our \r\nengagement in peacebuilding and our contribution to \r\nthe implementation of the New Deal for Engagement in \r\nFragile States with regard to Somalia and Liberia will \r\ncontinue.\r\nRussian acts of aggression and the illegal \r\nannexation of Ukrainian territory constitute serious \r\nbreaches of international law and have created a \r\nsecurity crisis in Europe, entailing significant risks \r\nto global stability. When a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, the body entrusted with the primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, attacks a sovereign country without \r\nany justification whatsoever, the world must react \r\nresolutely. If aggression is tolerated, there is no telling \r\nwho the next victim will be. If we accept the changing \r\nof borders by force, we also accept reopening the most \r\npainful chapters of our history.\r\n14-55191 15/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\nDefending the principles of international law, \r\nincluding the inviolability of borders, must be a \r\nresponsibility and an interest of all States. The Security \r\nCouncil should have formed the first line of defence \r\nfor those principles. Too many Governments around the \r\nworld have stayed silent when they should have spoken.\r\nWhile a great deal has been accomplished since \r\nthe adoption of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), we cannot accept the fact that hundreds of \r\nmillions of people are still lagging behind — many \r\nof them in conflict-affected and fragile States. It is \r\ntherefore important to accelerate efforts to address the \r\nunfinished business of the MDGs.\r\nThe United Nations has successfully presided over \r\na post-2015 consultation process with a near-global \r\nreach. All actors involved should be commended \r\nfor that. Sweden will now actively contribute to the \r\nintergovernmental deliberations in 2015 on the new \r\nuniversal development framework. With that in mind, \r\nwe look forward to the Secretary-General’s synthesis \r\nreport as a further guide for our work.\r\nThe world needs a transformative and universal \r\nnew framework for sustainable development. The \r\nnew goals will need to be accompanied by a strong \r\nmonitoring and accountability framework, allowing \r\nus to measure progress and ensure accountability at \r\nall levels, thereby ensuring that the global goals are \r\ntranslated into actions that makes a real difference for \r\nreal people. To achieve the new goals, the agenda must \r\nbe accompanied by a broad international consensus on \r\nfinancing for development and effective partnerships \r\nfor sustainable development. The United Nations, for \r\nits part, must be fit for that purpose so as to take on the \r\npost-2015 development challenges in an effective way.\r\nThe time leading up to the adoption of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda will be filled with challenging \r\nnegotiations. However, Sweden is confident that, one \r\nyear from now, we can arrive at a package that provides \r\na solid basis for a future that is more prosperous, more \r\ngender-equal, more peaceful, more democratic, more \r\nrespectful of human rights and more sustainable for us \r\nand our children.\r\nNeither development nor peace is possible without \r\na strong focus on the role of women. By empowering \r\nwomen, we simultaneously promote both peace and \r\ndevelopment. Gender equality is not only just economics \r\nbut also smart economics. A fundamental step towards \r\ngender equality is to ensure for women their sexual and \r\nreproductive health and rights, including freedom from \r\nviolence. We have the normative frameworks in place, \r\nincluding Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \r\non women, peace and security. The time has come to \r\ntranslate those norms into action.\r\nOne of the most serious global challenges is that \r\nof climate change. The impact is hardest on the world’s \r\npoorest and most vulnerable populations. Even if we \r\nmanage to limit the increase in temperature, the world \r\nwill experience significant adverse effects, especially \r\nin low-lying vulnerable island States. Sweden has \r\nsuccessfully demonstrated that it is possible to separate \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions and economic growth. Since \r\n1990, we have reduced our emissions by more than \r\n20 per cent while experiencing economic growth of \r\n60 per cent. For several years, Sweden has been a top \r\ncontributor to climate financing, not least through our \r\ndevelopment cooperation, with a focus on adaptation in \r\nthe least developed and most vulnerable countries.\r\nTogether with Colombia, Ethiopia, Indonesia, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, Norway and the United Kingdom, \r\nSweden initiated the Global Commission on the \r\nEconomy and Climate. The Commission’s recent report \r\nbrings good news. Its recommendations will bring net \r\neconomic benefits to countries at all income levels, \r\nincluding new jobs, cleaner air, better health, lower \r\npoverty and more energy security. The report, “Better \r\nGrowth, Better Climate”, points to a new and better \r\ndirection for our future.\r\nIn Paris in 2015, we will have a common \r\nresponsibility to reach a global and legally binding \r\nagreement that keeps us below the 2°C target. We must \r\nredouble our efforts to ensure that the Paris summit is \r\na success.\r\nThroughout history, people have moved between \r\ncountries, regions and continents in pursuit of a better \r\nlife. Today, numerous crises and conflicts have forced \r\nmore people from their homes worldwide than at any \r\ntime since the Second World War. The responsibility \r\nfor giving shelter and protection is most often borne by \r\nneighbouring countries. The international community \r\nis called upon to increase its solidarity and to strengthen \r\ninternational protection for those who need it. Sweden \r\nis heeding that call through its refugee policy and its \r\ntradition of being a place of refuge for people f leeing \r\npersecution and oppression. Last year, Sweden was the \r\nfifth largest donor to the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. In recent years, \r\n16/17 14-55191\r\nA/69/PV.19 29/09/2014\r\nSweden has been one of the top resettlement countries \r\nin the world.\r\nThe debate on migration often revolves around \r\nproblems and challenges. The fact is that migration \r\noffers huge opportunities and is a powerful enabler of \r\ndevelopment. Migration contributes to development and \r\nreduces poverty for migrant households. It also helps to \r\nfill needs in the labour market and to encourage trade \r\nand investment. Coordinated action and strong global \r\ncooperation are needed to maximize the positive effects \r\nof migration. Sweden is actively engaged in such global \r\nefforts, including, recently, through our chairmanship \r\nof the Global Forum on Migration and Development.\r\nSweden is currently the second largest recipient of \r\nasylum-seekers in the European Union and by far the \r\nlargest on a per capita basis. The makeup of migration \r\nf lows to our country has varied over time, but those \r\nwho have come to our country have in common that \r\nthey have all enriched our society. They have further \r\nopened our eyes to other peoples’ suffering and created \r\ncloseness to the outside world.\r\nSweden’s commitment to disbursing 1 per cent of \r\nits gross national income in development assistance, \r\nincluding our substantial contributions to the different \r\nparts of the United Nations system, enjoys strong \r\npopular support. The same goes for the public backing \r\nof our participation in United Nations peacekeeping. \r\nSome 80,000 Swedes have served in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions over the years, with our \r\nlatest deployment being our contribution of forces \r\nto the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali, which is currently under \r\nway.\r\nSweden is a candidate for a seat on the Security \r\nCouncil in 2017-2018, with the support of the Nordic \r\ncountries. We strongly believe that global challenges \r\nrequire multilateral governance structures that are \r\neffective and legitimate. A strong and well-functioning \r\nUnited Nations is at the heart of that system. Continued \r\nUnited Nations reform aimed at improving our ability to \r\npromote peace and security, reduce poverty, contribute \r\nto sustainable development, alleviate suffering and \r\nincrease respect for human rights is a work in progress, \r\nto which we all must contribute. Sweden is prepared to \r\ndo its part.\r\nI will make one final point. It is now 53 years \r\nsince Dag Hammarskjöld lost his life while on \r\nmission in Africa. Sweden welcomes the report of the \r\nHammarskjöld Commission on the death of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Dag Hammarskjöld (A/68/800, annex) and \r\nthe request by the Secretary-General to the General \r\nAssembly to consider it. We join the Secretary-General \r\nin encouraging Member States to declassify any relevant \r\nrecords that may bring new evidence with regard to the \r\ncrash of his plane. We welcome all that can be done to \r\nachieve further clarification of that matter. Such actions \r\nshould be carried out with due regard for the integrity \r\nof Dag Hammarskjöld and the other individuals who \r\nwere killed, their families and their memory.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting.\r\nThe representative of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran has requested to speak in exercise of the right of \r\nreply. May I remind him that statements in exercise \r\nof the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the \r\nfirst intervention and to five minutes for the second \r\nintervention and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Safaei (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have asked \r\nfor the f loor to reply to the senseless rhetorical statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Israeli regime this \r\nmorning in the General Assembly Hall (see A/69/\r\nPV.17) — a statement imbued with baseless allegations \r\nand distorted passages against my Government and \r\nwhich was basically designed to defend the atrocities that \r\nthat regime recently committed against a whole civilian \r\npopulation by attacking others. The speaker tried in \r\nvain to wash his hands of the most recent bloodbath in \r\nGaza, perpetrated before the eyes of the whole world. \r\nHe rushed to the General Assembly to hopelessly wage \r\nanother war, this time against the whole Islamic world \r\nand civilization, by associating them baselessly with the \r\nterrorist group of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS) and propagating Iranophobia and Islamophobia. \r\nHe was applauded for that by a crowd brought in from \r\noutside the United Nations.\r\nIt is, indeed, very ironic that a regime that is \r\nfamous for its atrocities, apartheid policies and war \r\ncrimes — facts that are well documented by different \r\nUnited Nations organs and agencies; a regime that is \r\nnon-compliant with many United Nations resolutions; \r\na regime that has been occupying the lands of other \r\npeoples for many decades can allow itself to accuse other \r\ncountries in such a sinister way. It is also preposterous \r\nthat the same regime, with a widely known record of \r\ndeveloping, producing and stockpiling various kinds \r\n14-55191 17/17\r\n29/09/2014 A/69/PV.19\r\nof inhumane weapons, including nuclear weapons, \r\nventures to falsely accuse others of trying to acquire \r\nsimilar weapons.\r\nIt is laughable for many to hear such a person speak \r\nof the atrocities committed by the ISIS terrorist group. \r\nIt is under the command of that person that, in the most \r\nrecent aggression against and invasion of Gaza, all \r\ninternational norms and laws were blatantly f louted, \r\nwhich led to the killing of more than 2,000 Palestinian \r\ncivilians, mostly women, children and the elderly, and \r\nthe injury of many more and the destruction of basic \r\ncivilian infrastructure, which rendered more than half a \r\nmillion people homeless, people who had already been \r\nunder an inhumane and suffocating Israeli blockade for \r\nmore than eight years.\r\nAgainst that backdrop and while he claimed to \r\nbe concerned over the Iranian nuclear programme, \r\nwhich is an entirely peaceful one under international \r\nsupervision, we in the region and across the globe are \r\ncompletely right to worry about nuclear weapons in the \r\nhands of a regime that has showed time and again its \r\ncapacity and propensity to kill, with the latest example \r\nbeing its rampage in July and August against the \r\ndefenceless Palestinians. Therefore, can we or any other \r\npeople believe that that speaker meant to do anything \r\nother than seek to divert international attention away \r\nfrom the crimes that his regime is committing in its \r\nneighbourhood?\r\nThe statement by the Israeli representative this \r\nmorning was a continuation of the well-known Israeli \r\npolicy of sabotaging and disrupting the earnest and \r\nserious negotiations that my Government has been \r\nengaged in during the past year to address any genuine \r\nconcern that any country may have about the Iranian \r\npeaceful nuclear programme. We have no doubt that \r\nany progress in those negotiations is a cause of severe \r\nanxiety and distress for Israel, as it has always sought \r\nto muddy the waters and make excuses for maintaining \r\nand advancing its policy of aggression and invasion.\r\nBased on all this, what we heard today from the said \r\nspeaker was not a torch of truth, but rather a bunch of \r\nlies. While I have the f loor, allow me also to refer very \r\nbriefly to the statement made by the Foreign Minister \r\nof Bahrain (see A/69/PV.17), in which reference was \r\nmade to the three Iranian islands in the Persian Gulf. I \r\nwould just like to remind the General Assembly of the \r\nstatement that my delegation delivered on 27 September \r\n(see A/69/PV.16) in reply to a similar baseless claim \r\nby the Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates. \r\nTherefore, I do not want to take the Assembly’s time to \r\nrepeat our well-founded position on the matter.\r\nRegarding the same statement, let me also recall \r\nthat the term Persian Gulf is and has always been the \r\nhistorical and time-honoured toponym for the stretch of \r\nwater situated between Iran and the Arabian peninsula. \r\nConsidering that historical evidence bears testimony \r\nto that fact and that the term is also internationally \r\nrecognized, as has been repeatedly asserted by the \r\nUnited Nations, it is unwarranted that the wrong label \r\nbe used for that geographical feature in the Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.05 p.m.\r\n"
