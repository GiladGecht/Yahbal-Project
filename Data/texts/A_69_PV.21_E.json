The report covers many \r\nissues of interest to Member States, such as the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, climate change, peace and \r\nsecurity, the development of Africa, disarmament, and \r\nemerging threats such as drugs, organized crime and \r\nterrorism. Many of those issues were emphasized by \r\nleaders during the general debate, and they will remain \r\nimportant throughout the sixty-ninth session.\r\nWith regard to sustainable development issues, \r\nsubstantive progress has been made towards preparing \r\nthe ground for the Secretary-General’s synthesis report \r\non the post-2015 development agenda. However, the \r\nimperative to accelerate progress on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly in areas where \r\nthe international community is noticeably lagging \r\nbehind — such as nutrition, maternal health, education \r\nand inequality — is highlighted in the report. At the \r\nsame time, we must maintain our focus on addressing \r\nclimate change, with a view to adopting a universal \r\nclimate agreement by 2015.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, the report strikes \r\na sobering tone on the regrettable developments \r\nthat have taken place in the past year in many parts \r\nof the world. Most notably, the situations point to the \r\ndaunting challenges which the global community is \r\ncollectively facing in efforts to address those issues \r\nmoving forward. In highlighting the inextricable nexus \r\nbetween development and peace and security, the report \r\npoints out that failure to address these challenges will \r\ninevitably stunt development aspirations, even as the \r\nworld looks to elaborate a new agenda. As a community \r\nof nations, we must wholeheartedly embrace efforts \r\ntowards conflict prevention, mediation, peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding. The role of the United Nations, \r\nin coordination and collaboration with regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, remains critical, including \r\nwith regard to curbing the activities of non-State actors.\r\nAs the Ebola outbreak continues to inflict grave \r\nconsequences on parts of West Africa, with potential \r\nregional and international dimensions, the epidemic \r\nserves as a reminder of the importance of continued \r\ncommitment to countries with special needs, including \r\nthose in Africa, landlocked developing countries, \r\nleast developed countries and small island developing \r\nStates. While considerable progress is being made \r\nby countries in special circumstances, the report \r\nhighlights the huge deficits that still exist with regard \r\nto health and educations systems, as well as energy \r\nand infrastructure. Finally, the report notes that we \r\nmust also develop measures to support countries \r\nmost affected by emerging threats to international \r\npeace, particularly organized crime, drug and human \r\ntrafficking and international terrorism.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): First of \r\nall, I would like to extend our sincere congratulations \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.21\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n21st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 7 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nto you, Mr. President, on your assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession, and to offer you our full support during our \r\nwork in the coming year. \r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/69/1), which highlights very \r\nsignificant and rapid changes ranging from inequalities \r\namong populations to the disastrous consequences of \r\nclimate change, armed conflict and terrorism. The \r\nmajor challenges facing the world today require our \r\nOrganization to adapt quickly in order to respond in a \r\ntimely manner, while strengthening its mediating role \r\non a sound and solid basis in the context of rules and \r\nparameters to improve its effectiveness. \r\nAs we all know, peacekeeping remains the f lagship \r\nactivity of the United Nations, as evidenced by the tens \r\nof thousands of peacekeepers deployed worldwide. \r\nThe commitment of the Kingdom of Morocco to \r\npeacekeeping operations dates back to 1960 and today \r\nis reflected in the 2,000 soldiers deployed on the Africa \r\ncontinent, in Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo and the Central African Republic, where \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco’s contribution has just been \r\nreinforced by the deployment of a Moroccan contingent \r\nin the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. \r\nThat ongoing commitment reflects the ongoing \r\nwillingness of my country to strengthen the concept \r\nof collective security, which is the core mandate of the \r\nOrganization. \r\nOver the past year, the Organization has certainly \r\nresponded effectively to a number of challenges in \r\nvarious areas, such as poverty reduction, primary \r\nschool enrolment, access to drinking water and \r\nreducing maternal and child mortality. It has played a \r\nremarkable role in natural disasters and in humanitarian \r\nrelief. However, we must note that the attainment of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals has been uneven \r\nand that, with the target date of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals approaching, priority should be \r\ngiven to the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nDevelopment must remain at the heart of our \r\nconcerns, along with urgent measures to strengthen \r\nsocioeconomic stability so as to better respond to the \r\nglobal challenges we are all dealing with today. Africa \r\nremains the most vulnerable and affected region in \r\nterms of natural disasters, poverty, famine, disease - in \r\nparticular HIV/AIDS and the recent Ebola epidemic with \r\nits devastating effects - armed conflicts and terrorism \r\nof all stripes. The United Nations will therefore have to \r\ncontinue to pay particular attention to the difficulties \r\nfaced by developing countries, especially in Africa, \r\nwhich require more engaged action on the part of all \r\npartners with a view to making a greater and more \r\neffective contribution to the advent of a world of lasting \r\npeace and shared prosperity. \r\nAs was highlighted in a message that His Majesty \r\nthe King delivered to the General Assembly at its most \r\nrecent general debate:\r\n“The world stands at a crossroads today. Either \r\nthe international community supports developing \r\ncountries in their quest to achieve progress and \r\nensure security and stability, or we shall all face \r\nthe consequences of more conflicts and greater \r\nfanaticism, violence and terrorism - all of which \r\nfeed on feelings of injustice and exclusion - and no \r\npart of the world will be safe.” (A/69/PV.11, p. 26)\r\nTherefore, on the basis of that observation, \r\nour Organization is called upon to challenge itself \r\nand undertake a self-critique in order to rise to the \r\nexpectations and assume the role assigned to it by \r\nthe San Francisco Conference. In that context, the \r\nproliferation of terrorism, obscurantism and extremist \r\nideologies is of concern for the international community \r\nand requires combined efforts by all to stem it. \r\nFor its part, the Kingdom of Morocco has made an \r\nactive contribution to efforts to combat terrorism in \r\nall its forms, as noted and praised by the international \r\ncommunity. Its long-standing commitment in the \r\nfight against that phenomenon was recognized last \r\nweek by the Counter-Terrorism Committee, which \r\ndevoted a full meeting to reviewing its experience in \r\nthe fight against extremism and intolerance and their \r\nincitement to terrorist acts. Moroccan participants in \r\nthe high-level panel presented the role Morocco has \r\nplayed in the fight against violent extremism through \r\nits comprehensive approach, which is based on the \r\ntriad of training, development and security. In addition, \r\nMorocco’s cooperation with friendly African countries \r\nin training imams on the precepts of moderation in \r\nauthentic Malikite Islam was welcomed by the panel, \r\nwhich consisted of senior religious leaders from Mali, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Guinea and Mauritania. \r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco notes with satisfaction \r\nthe progress made in certain areas of Africa, including \r\nCôte d’Ivoire and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n14-55823 3/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nMy delegation also wishes to reiterate the Kingdom’s \r\nfirm commitment to continuing the programmes of \r\ncooperation and solidarity with brotherly African \r\ncountries to strengthen South-South cooperation \r\nthrough partnerships based on the win/win approach. \r\nMoreover, Morocco, which has always focused \r\non dialogue and consultation, has made  a substantial \r\ncontribution to initiatives for peaceful conflict \r\nresolution. My delegation fervently hopes for an end \r\nto the violence in Syria and Libya and a political \r\ntransition that meets the aspirations of the peoples and \r\nwill be able to guarantee territorial integrity, national \r\nunity and stability throughout the region. Morocco \r\nalso calls for international support to be mobilized \r\non the Palestinian issue and for the establishment of \r\nan independent Palestinian State, living side by side in \r\npeace and security with Israel. \r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that Morocco remains \r\ncommitted and willing to work with all Member States \r\nof our Organization to build a strong United Nations \r\nthat is able to carry out the difficult tasks entrusted to \r\nit and deal with the many challenges that it must face in \r\nthe twenty-first century. We must all work tirelessly in \r\na collective and coordinated manner to ensure respect \r\nfor peace, security and the dissemination of the values \r\nof tolerance and coexistence, in the service of all of \r\nhumankind.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nthank the Secretary-General for submitting his report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/69/1). \r\nOn 24 October 2015, we will commemorate the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the official founding of the \r\nUnited Nations. On that same date in 1945, the world \r\nbegan the process of recovering from a bloody world \r\nwar that had killed approximately 60 million human \r\nbeings, or about 2 per cent of the global population \r\nat the time. The 51 founding Member States ushered \r\nin an era that was already faced with the challenge of \r\nthe destructive power of the atomic bomb, which the \r\ninhabitants of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had experienced \r\njust over two months earlier. \r\nSeven decades later, humankind is caught between \r\nlife and death, facing serious threats. The existence \r\nof thousands of nuclear weapons with the capacity to \r\nrender humankind extinct, climate change’s destructive \r\nacceleration, severe pandemics that are rapidly \r\nexpanding, and new threats and attacks against the \r\nsovereignty and self-determination of peoples are only \r\na few of the most serious threats. There are 7.2 billion \r\npeople waiting for the United Nations to fulfil the \r\nreason for its very existence.\r\nCuba agrees with the Secretary-General that \r\npriority must be placed on eliminating nuclear weapons \r\nand other weapons of mass destruction. Nothing can \r\njustify the fact that, nearly 25 years after the end of \r\nthe Cold War was declared, humankind continues to \r\nbe threatened by the existence of more than 16,000 \r\nnuclear weapons, 4,000 of which are ready for \r\nimmediate use. The use of only a fraction of them \r\nwould have catastrophic consequences for our planet, \r\nhence the importance of the historic step taken by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in designating 26 September as the \r\nInternational Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, which was recently celebrated with great \r\nsuccess for the first time. \r\nThe only way to ensure that humankind will \r\nnever again suffer the terrible consequences of the \r\nuse of nuclear weapons is their total prohibition and \r\nelimination. To that end, the vast majority of Member \r\nStates have proposed to conclude a comprehensive \r\nconvention on nuclear weapons prohibiting the \r\npossession, development, production, acquisition, \r\ntesting, stockpiling, transfer, use or threat of use of \r\nnuclear weapons and thus providing for their destruction. \r\nWe call on the Secretary-General to continue to bring \r\nhis to influence to bear on the start of negotiations on \r\nsuch a convention. \r\nClimate change is unequivocally real, and \r\nhumankind’s hand in its acceleration increasingly clear. \r\nThe Earth’s ice coverage is decreasing. Global surface \r\ntemperature is increasing, and sea level is gradually \r\nrising. There are many extreme weather events, and \r\nthe effects of the acidification of the seas and oceans \r\nare becoming clear. Global greenhouse gas emissions, \r\nwhich drive warming, have not stopped increasing over \r\nthe past four decades.\r\nThe root cause of the global environmental crisis, \r\nincluding climate change, remains the irrational and \r\nunsustainable patterns of production and consumption \r\nstemming from the capitalist system of economic \r\ndomination, which gives rise to inequality and poverty. \r\nWe cannot consider tackling climate change without \r\neven proposing to address its root causes or engaging \r\nin a determined fight against poverty and inequality. \r\nWe know that the market will not solve any of those \r\nproblems. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba stated in his speech at the 2014 Climate \r\n4/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nSummit, enormous efforts and clear commitments \r\nare required. Real political will is required from the \r\nGovernments of industrialized countries, which will \r\nnecessarily share the fate of the impoverished South. \r\nIt is unacceptable that the Millennium Development \r\nGoals cannot be achieved despite the vast resources \r\nthat exist and the technological revolution that \r\nhumankind has wrought. The necessary solutions are \r\nbeing postponed, and we deceive ourselves if we think \r\nthat only a United Nations agreement that establishes \r\ngoals and objectives for the sustainable development \r\nagenda will address the injustices, inequalities and root \r\ncauses of the underdevelopment of various parts of the \r\nplanet. The participation of all Member States, first \r\nand foremost the industrialized countries, is required. \r\nCertain Powers have a historical debt to the peoples who \r\nwere plundered under colonial and neocolonial regimes \r\nand the unjust system of economic and financial \r\nrelations that is currently imposed on the world. \r\nWe cannot achieve a new sustainable development \r\nagenda when the wealthiest 1 per cent of the planet’s \r\npopulation owns 50 per cent of global wealth and the \r\n85 wealthiest people in the world own the equivalent \r\nof the economic resources of the 3.57 billion poorest, \r\nwho represent half of the world’s population. A new \r\nsustainable development agenda will remain out \r\nof reach so long as one in five people in developing \r\ncountries still lives on less than $1.25 per day and almost \r\n1.5 billion people, in 91 countries, continue to live in \r\na situation of multifaceted poverty, with concurrent \r\ndeficits in health, education and living standards.\r\nA new sustainable development agenda will remain \r\nout of reach as long as 842 million people, almost one \r\nin every eight people, remain food insecure, as was the \r\ncase between 2011 and 2013, or while people continue \r\nsuffering foreign occupation, as do the Palestinian \r\npeople. The resources needed to implement a new \r\nsustainable development agenda would be available if \r\nonly a fraction of the vast global military expenditure, \r\nwhich reached the colossal figure of $1,747 billion \r\nin 2013, were devoted to covering the means of \r\nimplementation required.\r\nThe General Assembly has the responsibility to \r\nmobilize the financial resources needed to overcome \r\nthe problems mentioned and others included in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization. The strengthening of the General \r\nAssembly and far-reaching reform of the Security \r\nCouncil into a democratic, transparent and inclusive \r\nbody cannot be postponed.\r\nHumankind is facing a new challenge in the impact \r\nand spread of Ebola in West Africa. Urgent action is \r\nrequired. Cuba responded promptly to the call of the \r\nDirector-General of the World Health Organization and \r\nthe Secretary-General regarding the situation. The first \r\ngroup of international health experts is already in Sierra \r\nLeone. The historic leader of the Cuban Revolution, \r\nFidel Castro, described those health-care heroes as the \r\nheroes of our time in an article published on 4 October. \r\nLet me cite an excerpt from that article:\r\n“It will not be lethal arms manufacturers who are \r\nhonoured in the future. May the example of those \r\nCubans setting off for Africa inspire the hearts \r\nand minds of other physicians around the world, \r\nespecially those with greater resources, whatever \r\ntheir religion, with the firmest devotion to the duty \r\nof human solidarity.”\r\nThis is the spirit and the political will that are \r\nrequired to overcome the challenges we find before \r\nus. Cuba - a small, poor country under an economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade imposed by the \r\nlargest global Power - is showing that it is possible.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): We thank the \r\nSecretary-General for a comprehensive and forward-\r\nlooking report (A/69/1). The past year has been a \r\ndifficult one for peace and security, as existing conflicts \r\nbecame more complex, new conflicts emerged and new \r\nforms of violence hit several countries. We commend \r\nthe Secretary-General’s statesmanship in the face of \r\nthose challenges. His single-minded focus on dialogue, \r\ndiplomacy and the pacific settlement of disputes was a \r\nray of hope in many dark situations.\r\nThe state of peace and security in many parts of the \r\nworld is precarious, and it is drifting towards disarray. \r\nThe post-Cold War equilibrium is under severe stress. \r\nNew cold wars and rifts are surfacing. In hindsight, it \r\nappears that regional and trans-regional institutions \r\ncapable of absorbing the shocks of the last year and \r\nfending off the tragic events we have witnessed have \r\nnot been built over the years. The United Nations \r\nleads the efforts of the international community, but it \r\nalso needs the support of regional underpinnings that \r\ncould transform this community into one family with a \r\ncommon idiom for peace and security.\r\n14-55823 5/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nThe Secretary-General in his assessment has \r\ntalked about worrying trends in the global security \r\nenvironment. He has specifically mentioned Ukraine, \r\nthe Middle East, South Sudan and the Central African \r\nRepublic. The differences between criminals, hostile \r\ngroups and peace-spoilers have blurred. He has also \r\nalluded to potential safety and security risks from the \r\nunauthorized use of nuclear, radiological, biological \r\nand chemical materials. We should have strategies in \r\nplace to counter those threats.\r\nWe appreciate the combined efforts of the Security \r\nCouncil and the Secretary-General to create a semblance \r\nof stability in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the extended Great Lakes region, as well as in the \r\ngreater Sahel region, including Mali. But peace in these \r\nregions, as well as in West Africa, is fragile and prone \r\nto relapse into conflict. The Ebola virus has made the \r\nsituation worse.\r\nWe support the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to oppose the reign of terror unleashed by \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, a phenomenon \r\nthat does not have the sanction of any religion or \r\ndenomination. In addition to dealing with that scourge \r\ndirectly, it is imperative to steer warring forces in Syria \r\ntowards dialogue and reconciliation.\r\nAfter the summer of killings in Gaza this year, a \r\ntwo-State solution should not become a mirage once \r\nagain. We call on the Quartet to revive the stalled peace \r\ntalks to free Palestinian prisoners, lift the blockade of \r\nGaza and reach agreement on Palestine’s fully sovereign \r\nstatehood.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions play a pivotal \r\nrole in making and sustaining peace. Pakistan, as a top \r\ntroop contributor, will continue to put its peacekeepers \r\nat the disposal of the United Nations. Only recently, we \r\nhave deployed more than 1,100 troops to the Central \r\nAfrican Republic to help stabilize the situation there. \r\nWe will fully engage with the Secretary-General and \r\nhis high-level panel on the upcoming strategic review \r\nof peacekeeping. We appreciate the need for f lexible, \r\nmobile and nimble operations and look forward to \r\ndiscussing the full range of issues covering core \r\nmandates, rapid deployment, command and control, \r\nnew technologies and their international humanitarian \r\nlaw implications. The timely initiative of United States \r\nVice President Joe Biden to host a summit has helped \r\nus put some of those issues on the table so that we can \r\ncome up with a clearer road map for peacekeeping \r\noperations.\r\nIn our neighbourhood, we are pursuing a policy \r\nof constructive engagement to resolve differences \r\nand enhance economic opportunities for the region. \r\nLongstanding, festering issues cannot be swept under \r\nthe carpet. As Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said before \r\nthe Assembly, the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir \r\nhas to be resolved through negotiations, in accordance \r\nwith the wishes of its people (see A/69/PV.12). In \r\nthat regard, he reminded the United Nations of its \r\nown responsibility. We expressed deep concern over \r\nthe recent escalation of violations of the ceasefire at \r\nthe Line of Control and the working boundary by the \r\nIndian security forces. As a result of the Indian firing \r\nyesterday, four innocent lives were lost on the occasion \r\nof Eid al-Adha. We call upon the Indian Government to \r\nimmediately cease fire and help us preserve tranquillity. \r\nThe United Nations Military Observer Group in India \r\nand Pakistan must also be enabled to play its role in \r\nmonitoring the ceasefire. \r\nWe have welcomed the formation of the new \r\nGovernment in Afghanistan. We wish the people of \r\nAfghanistan well as they strengthen their security \r\ninstitutions and pursue economic development. \r\nPakistan will steadfastly work with Afghanistan \r\nto fight terrorism and create new opportunities for \r\ncollaboration in the industrial, trade, infrastructure and \r\nenergy sectors. \r\nIn our ongoing fight against terrorism, we are \r\ndetermined to eliminate that threat from our soil. \r\nOur heroic armed forces are taking out terrorists, \r\ndismantling their hideouts and networks, and choking \r\nthe vicious forces and sources that feed them. Our \r\nentire nation stands united to defeat that evil force and \r\nits ideology of hate.\r\nIn the realm of non-proliferation and disarmament, \r\nPakistan advocates security for all. To gain movement \r\nin the Conference on Disarmament, the four core \r\nissues - disarmament, a fissile material treaty, the \r\nprevention of an arms race in outer space and negative \r\nsecurity assurances - must be tackled simultaneously \r\nand without accentuating asymmetries in the existing \r\nstocks of fissile materials. Pakistan qualifies for \r\nmembership of export control regimes, especially the \r\nNuclear Suppliers Group, and full access to peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear technology.\r\n6/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nUnited Nations reform should be comprehensive. \r\nThe Security Council should reflect the interests of \r\nall Member States - small, medium-sized and large – \r\nand not the ambitions of a few. The Prime Minister of \r\nPakistan told the Assembly last month: \r\n“There should be no new permanent seats in the \r\nCouncil. That would be contrary to the democratic \r\ncharacter of this world body” (A/69/PV.12, p. 39).\r\nIn the next 15 years, we will need an integrative \r\nvision for ambitious goals for sustainable development, \r\nmatching resources to achieve them and broad \r\npartnerships that would deliver on the transformative \r\nuniversal agenda that we will put together. The post-\r\n2015 development agenda has to address the social, \r\neconomic and environmental dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. But it would be an illusion to think that \r\nwe could achieve those goals without putting equal \r\nemphasis on peace and security, democratic governance, \r\nthe rule of law, access to justice, human rights, gender \r\nparity and above all institution-building. Those are \r\nall indispensable critical enablers for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe sustainable development goals, negotiated and \r\nendorsed by Member States, reflect their collective will \r\nto end poverty and create conditions for the equitable \r\ndistribution of wealth. We now look forward to the \r\nSecretary-General’s synthesis report that would include \r\nthe work of the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the recommendations of \r\nthe Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing. The latter’s \r\nrecommendations will have to be harmonized with the \r\nrules that would emerge from the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development next year. \r\nThat will be necessary to unlock resources, but those \r\nresources will not be available if we do not work \r\nhard to build partnerships among the United Nations, \r\nGovernments, businesses, civil society and multilateral \r\nfinancial institutions. We believe that we should build a \r\nreview system into the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s extraordinary leadership \r\nand diligence were instrumental in making last month’s \r\nClimate Summit successful. If conscious human \r\nactivity is the dominant cause of the observed global \r\nwarming, and there is compelling scientific evidence \r\nthat it is, we can take steps to reverse it. It is therefore \r\nabsolutely necessary that the political commitments \r\nmade by world leaders at the Climate Summit this year \r\nbe translated into a global climate agreement in 2015. \r\nDuring this session, we will support your efforts, \r\nMr. President, to make progress on all those critical \r\nissues.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your assumption \r\nof duties as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session. Japan looks forward to your \r\nleadership during the current session in dealing with \r\nthe challenges that the General Assembly is facing. \r\nJapan wishes to work with you for the success of \r\nthe session. I further would like to convey to His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon Japan’s \r\ndeep appreciation for his efforts in guiding the diverse \r\nactivities of the United Nations and for his latest report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/69/1).\r\nDuring their visit to New York for the high-level \r\nsegment of the General Assembly two weeks ago, \r\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs Fumio Kishida collaborated with many \r\nworld leaders to make progress on the most prevalent \r\nchallenges facing the world today. While attending the \r\n2014 Climate Summit and the high-level meeting on \r\nEbola, Prime Minister Abe outlined Japan’s response to \r\neach of those pressing issues. To battle climate change, \r\nmy Government will provide adaptive assistance to \r\ndeveloping countries, promote technological innovation \r\nfor energy efficiency and contribute to the future \r\ninternational framework. In the fight against the Ebola \r\nvirus, Japan is providing $40 million in new assistance \r\nfor the West African countries affected by the outbreak \r\nand supports the initiative of the Secretary-General \r\nto establish the United Nations Mission for Ebola \r\nEmergency Response. In that regard, on 3 October the \r\nGovernment of Japan decided to extend emergency \r\ngrant aid in the amount of $22 million.\r\nFinally, in his statement to the General Assembly \r\n(see A/69/PV.9), Prime Minister Abe called upon the \r\nOrganization and its Member States to work together to \r\nfinally resolve the long-standing issue of the reform of \r\nthe United Nations in a way that reflects the realities of \r\nthe twenty-first century. In that context, Japan seeks to \r\nbecome a permanent member of the Security Council \r\nand to take on the appropriate role that such a status \r\nrequires.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are the \r\nOrganization’s most important tool for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. We should also \r\nrecognize the challenge facing us, that is, how to \r\nmake United Nations peacekeeping operations more \r\n14-55823 7/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nsustainable with regard to both the financial and the \r\nhuman resource aspects. That requires us to take \r\nconcrete and holistic actions to improve that tool.\r\nIn that connection, Japan continues to contribute to \r\npeacekeeping operations by broadening its involvement \r\nunder the banner of Japan’s proactive contribution to \r\npeace through commitments announced by Prime \r\nMinister Abe at the peacekeeping summit, held in \r\nSeptember. Japan also supports the strategic review \r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General and will proactively \r\ncontribute to peacekeeping-related issues during this \r\nsession through active participation in the upcoming \r\ndiscussions in the Special Committee on Peacekeeping \r\nOperations and the Fifth Committee.\r\nWith regard to the Peacebuilding Commission \r\n(PBC), Japan has been a member of the PBC since its \r\nestablishment in 2005. Since 2011, Japan has held the \r\nchairmanship of the PBC’s Working Group on Lessons \r\nLearned. This year, the Working Group held a series of \r\nmeetings on the challenges of United Nations mission \r\ndrawdowns and withdrawals. We will conclude that \r\nexercise with a report of the Chair, to be issued by the \r\nend of the year. We hope that the report will benefit \r\nthe 2015 review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture by providing a useful perspective on the \r\nrole to be played by the PBC in the context of United \r\nNations mission transition.\r\nWe now face the monumental and historic task of \r\nformulating and adopting the post-2015 development \r\nagenda next year. I believe that inclusiveness, \r\nsustainability and resilience will be important elements \r\nof the agenda. I would also like to point out that next \r\nMarch, Japan will host the third World Conference \r\non Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai. We believe \r\nthat the Conference will be an opportunity to discuss \r\nhumanitarian issues and disaster prevention in an \r\nintegrated manner and will contribute to international \r\ncooperation in disaster risk reduction, as well as the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe process of the Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development (TICAD) has been running \r\nsince 1993 through close cooperation among Japan, the \r\nUnited Nations Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, \r\nthe African Union Commission, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the World Bank. Africa \r\nand Japan have shared both the concept and the practice \r\nof development rooted in the idea of ownership and \r\npartnership for over 20 years. To continue building on \r\nthat foundation, Japan will mobilize up to $32 billion \r\nbetween 2013 and 2017 in both the public and the private \r\nsectors, as announced at the fifth Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development in Yokohama, \r\nJapan, last year. Japan is determined to further enhance \r\nour efforts through the TICAD process to promote \r\ntransformative, resilient and inclusive growth across \r\nAfrica.\r\nToday, there are still more than 16,000 nuclear \r\nweapons in the world. Japan believes that efforts to \r\naddress the issue of non-proliferation should be rooted \r\nin a clear understanding of the humanitarian impact \r\nof the use of nuclear weapons and in an objective \r\nassessment of the state of the international system, \r\nwhich faces increasingly diverse nuclear risks. Japan \r\nis determined to continue making steady progress in \r\nglobal nuclear disarmament by helping to reduce the \r\nnumber of nuclear weapons, the role that they play and \r\nthe incentive to possess them, as well as by preventing \r\nthe emergence of new nuclear States, the proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapon-related materials and technologies \r\nand nuclear terrorism.\r\nJapan promotes the agenda of a society in which \r\nwomen shine, as Prime Minister Abe reiterated last \r\nmonth to the General Assembly. The United Nations \r\nand its Member States need to act together towards the \r\npromotion of the rights of various vulnerable groups. \r\nJapan’s ratification of the Convention on the Rights \r\nof Persons with Disabilities in January is one recent \r\nexample of its commitment to the advancement of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nJapan welcomes the Human Rights Council’s \r\nvigorous efforts, including the report produced by \r\nthe United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human \r\nRights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nJapan, together with the European Union, will sponsor \r\nanother resolution on the human rights situation in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea at this session \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Mahmadaminov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWith regard to administrative and budgetary \r\nissues, the main session is scheduled to consider both \r\nthe first performance report of the 2014-2015 budget \r\nand the 2016-2017 budget outline. From the perspective \r\nof applying budgetary discipline, my delegation will \r\ncarefully analyse and assess all potential additional \r\nrequirements for the current budget. We request the \r\nSecretariat to consider the next biennium budget on \r\n8/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nthe basis of not just extending the 2014-2015 budget \r\nbut a fresh look at the needs of the Organization. \r\nJapan expresses its appreciation for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s continued and strong commitment to a better \r\nmanagement of the Secretariat and United Nations \r\nfacilities.\r\nI will conclude my statement today with a reminder \r\nthat 2015, next year, marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe founding of the United Nations. Japan will continue \r\nto work closely with the Secretary-General to ensure a \r\nmore effective and efficient United Nations. We hope \r\nthat the United Nations and its Member States will do \r\nthe same, while invoking a future forward outlook to \r\ntackle the most pressing challenges of our day.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, I wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor presenting his report on the work of the Organization \r\nduring the past year and on the challenges facing us in \r\n2015 (A/69/1). \r\nAs the Secretary-General notes, this year has \r\npresented challenges but also significant progress in \r\nthe shared dialogue on the international development \r\nagenda in terms of both the implementation the \r\nMillennium Development Goals in this year that \r\nremains to achieve them and the definition of the new \r\ndevelopment agenda, to be implemented from 2015. \r\nIn that regard, we are grateful for the report and the \r\noverview of the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals that it provides. We particularly \r\nwelcome the progress made, for example, in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean in achieving and exceeding \r\nthe goals set for our region on reducing extreme poverty \r\nand on equality between men and women in the area of \r\neducation. We also welcome the region’s affirmation \r\nthat the employment rate has grown steadily, despite \r\nthe global employment rate seeing a slight drop, and \r\nthat we are on the way to meeting the goal of reducing \r\nhunger by half. Those results encourage us to redouble \r\nour efforts in the context of the post-2015 agenda in \r\nthose areas and regions where progress has been slower \r\nand to set ourselves more ambitious targets so as to \r\neradicate extreme poverty once and for all by 2030.\r\nWith regard to the discussions on the international \r\ncooperation development agenda, we wish to highlight \r\nthe importance of the summit of the Group of 77 \r\n(G-77) and China, convened by the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia in Santa Cruz de la Sierra in June, in the context \r\nof the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the \r\nGroup. The meeting allowed an open and substantive \r\ndialogue among leaders of the developing world, which \r\nled to the adoption of the declaration entitled “For a \r\nnew world order for living well” (A/68/948, annex). The \r\ndeclaration included definitions to chart the course for \r\nthe G-77 and China in the coming years.\r\nThis session is taking place in a year that is clearly \r\nkey for defining fundamental issues with regard to \r\nnot only international cooperation and developing \r\ncountries but also multilateralism as a whole. We have \r\nthe opportunity to strengthen the United Nations as the \r\nuniversal and democratic forum par excellence that is \r\nable to reach consensus and to develop effective and \r\nrealistic solutions to provide greater safety and well-\r\nbeing to our peoples. In that regard, we believe that the \r\nnegotiation of the post-2015 development agenda, the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nduring the first part of next year and the negotiation \r\nof an international legal framework for sovereign debt \r\nrestructuring at a time when such a legal framework \r\nis clearly necessary will provide opportunities that we \r\nshould not miss.\r\nFor Argentina, the crux of the debate is sustainable \r\ndevelopment, understood as a concept that encompasses \r\nthe three dimensions of development. The eradication \r\nof poverty, social inclusion, job creation and \r\nenvironmental protection remain urgent themes and \r\nthe cornerstones of the post-2015 agenda. Integrated \r\nstrategies to overcome those challenges require a \r\ngreater commitment to providing financial resources \r\nand technology transfer, with a true will to close the \r\nexisting structural gaps among countries.\r\nIt is essential to the success of the post-2015 agenda \r\nthat the various development levels of countries, their \r\npriorities and capacities and respect for the sovereignty \r\nof States over their resources, on the basis of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities, be taken into \r\naccount. In particular, I wish to highlight the depth of \r\nthe analysis and the dialogue during the negotiation \r\nprocess of the Open Working Group of the General \r\nAssembly on Sustainable Development Goals. That \r\nculminated in a final document (A/68/970) that reflects \r\nthe intense and transparent work of the Open Working \r\nGroup. That document must be seen as a fundamental \r\nand substantive element of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda negotiation process.\r\nA few days ago, on 9 September, the General \r\nAssembly took the historic decision to resolve, within \r\na reasonable time frame, a matter of vital importance \r\nto the international community. With the adoption of \r\n14-55823 9/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nresolution 68/304, entitled “Towards the establishment \r\nof a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt \r\nrestructuring processes”, the United Nations decided \r\nto develop and to adopt at this session a multilateral \r\npolicy framework through an open and transparent \r\nintergovernmental process in order to prevent the \r\npredatory actions of vulture funds conspiring against \r\nsustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth \r\nand the sustainable development of our peoples.\r\nResolution 68/304 is a true reflection of the \r\nimportance and urgency that the overwhelming majority \r\nof nations of the world grant to a reality that finds us \r\nunprotected against the use and abuse by speculators \r\nof the existing policy gap in the current international \r\nfinancial system for sovereign debt restructuring. \r\nTogether. we decided that the time had come to provide \r\nthe financial system with a legal framework that enabled \r\ncountries to emerge from the debt crisis in a sustainable \r\nway. That effort is not only a concern of Argentina or of \r\ndeveloping countries against vulture funds. It denotes \r\ntaking a position against international extortion \r\nand financial speculation in favour of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. As the only universal international forum \r\nwhere all countries are represented on an equal footing, \r\nthe General Assembly is the right forum to resolve that \r\nissue.\r\nParagraph 46 of the Secrtary-General’s report \r\npoints out that the per capita cost of peacekeeping \r\nactivities has been reduced by 15 per cent over four \r\nyears. While we recognize and appreciate the need to \r\nachieve efficiency in the cost of peacekeeping missions \r\nand the importance in that regard of mechanisms such \r\nas a support strategy for field activities, we recognize \r\nthat such a reduction also reflects the negative trend \r\nseen in the Organization of increasing the complexity \r\nof mission mandates without making provision for \r\nthe financial resources necessary for their proper \r\nexecution. It does not seem reasonable to demand an \r\nincreasing number of tasks of our Blue Helmets, which \r\ninvolves a greater cost, in places that are operationally \r\nmore complex, while seeking to freeze the budget for \r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nIn terms of strengthening the Organization, we \r\nhope that all Member States will continue the ongoing \r\ndialogue with the Secretary-General with regard to \r\nimplementing the proposals for reviewing processes \r\nlinked to both institutional and human resources, while \r\nalways seeking to more effectively achieve substantive \r\nresults, as in the case of the Rights Up Front initiative, \r\nfor example.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations information \r\ntechnology and communications strategy, we support \r\nthe pursuit of sustainable solutions and the use of \r\nnew technology, provided that they help not only to \r\nreduce costs but also to increase efficiency and to \r\nmeet objectives such as, for example, the aspiration \r\nfor better communication in all official languages, \r\nincluding Spanish, so that all countries and regions, \r\nwhatever their stage of development, are better able to \r\ntake advantage of and to leverage the tools developed \r\nby the United Nations and to access the knowledge that \r\nit gathers and disseminates.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate that the President \r\nand the Secretary-General can depend on the support \r\nof the delegation of Argentina in our work during this \r\nsixty-ninth session.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/69/1). \r\nThe international situation is undergoing profound \r\nand complex changes. Our world is becoming a \r\nmultipolar one, with increasing economic globalization, \r\ncultural diversification and growing use of information \r\ntechnology. The trends of peace, development, \r\ncooperation and win-win results are growing stronger. \r\nAt the same time, peace still eludes our world. Regional \r\nconflicts and local wars emerge one after the other. The \r\npath of global development remains long and arduous. \r\nThe international community faces all kinds of \r\ninterlinked, long-standing and non-traditional security \r\nthreats. Global issues have become more prominent.\r\nThroughout the past year, the United Nations has \r\ncontinued to push forward multilateral cooperation. \r\nThe Organization has adopted a series of actions to \r\nadvance peace, to properly resolve regional hot-spot \r\nissues, to promote economic and social development, \r\nto develop the post-2015 development agenda, to \r\ncoordinate international humanitarian assistance, \r\nto promote disarmament and to combat terrorism, \r\nachieving outstanding results. In that way, it has not \r\nonly addressed the concerns of Member States in \r\ngeneral, but also has further enhanced the central \r\nposition of the United Nations in the multilateral \r\nsystem. China appreciates the work undertaken by \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the Secretariat.\r\n10/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nThe United Nations, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil as the core international security mechanism, is \r\nduty bound to maintain international peace and security. \r\nIn addressing all kinds of international threats and \r\nchallenges, the international community must respect \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. On the basis of respect for the independence, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Member States, \r\nwe must implement the mechanisms provided for under \r\nthe Charter in an integrated way, resolve issues through \r\npeaceful means and give full play to the role of regional \r\nand subregional organizations.\r\nChina supports Iraq in its efforts to safeguard its \r\nnational sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity. We call for greater humanitarian assistance \r\nto Iraq so as to help the Iraqi people to overcome their \r\ndifficulties and to achieve national peace and stability.\r\nThe conflict and violence in Syria must cease as \r\nsoon as possible. China hopes that all parties in Syria \r\nwill achieve a ceasefire, put an end to the violence, \r\nresume their dialogue and negotiations and find a \r\ncompromise solution that draws on useful international \r\nand regional experience, is in line with Syria’s national \r\nconditions and takes into account the interests of all \r\nparties.\r\nChina firmly opposes all forms of terrorism. We \r\nsupport the efforts of the international community \r\nto implement Security Council resolutions and to \r\ncoordinate efforts to deal with the threat of terrorist \r\nfighters on the basis of respect for the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nbasic norms governing international relations.\r\nChina calls on all parties in Ukraine to effectively \r\nimplement the Minsk ceasefire agreement and to seek a \r\ncomprehensive, lasting and balanced political solution \r\nthrough dialogue and negotiations. The United Nations \r\nmust play its due role in that regard.\r\nAs the starting point for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, 2015 will be a significant year. The international \r\ncommunity must demonstrate a spirit of mutual \r\ninterest, a win-win approach and cooperation and must \r\njointly develop a fair, inclusive and sustainable post-\r\n2015 development agenda. \r\nChina believes that the post-2015 development \r\nagenda should achieve three objectives. First, it should \r\nseek to improve people’s well-being, focusing on the \r\neradication of poverty and the promotion of development. \r\nSecondly, it should enhance inclusiveness so as to \r\nmaintain social fairness and justice. Thirdly, it should \r\nfocus on implementation and promote the principles \r\nof diversified development models and common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, strengthen global \r\ndevelopment partnerships and improve implementation \r\nmeasures and mechanisms.\r\nClimate change is a challenge for all humankind \r\nand, as such, calls for the cooperation of the international \r\ncommunity. Mr. Zhang Gaoli, the Chinese President’s \r\nenvoy and Vice-Premier of the State Council, led \r\nthe Chinese delegation at the Climate Summit last \r\nmonth. The meeting gave rise to fresh momentum for \r\ninternational cooperation on climate change. China \r\nappreciates that development. We hope that, on the \r\nbasis of the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities, fairness and respective capacities, \r\nthe international community will complete by 2015 \r\nthe negotiations on a new post-2020 agenda to address \r\nclimate change and to ensure fairer, more rational and \r\neffective arrangements for international cooperation on \r\nclimate change.\r\nThe international situation is changing. The \r\nopportunites and challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity are changing. The United Nations functions \r\nand missions are also undergoing adjustments. The \r\nUnited Nations must keep pace with the times and, in \r\nthe light of developing situations, carry out rational and \r\nnecessary reforms to strengthen its authority, increase \r\nits efficiency and better implement its obligations under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nChina welcomes the progress made in achieving \r\nsuch reform of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly. We stand ready \r\nto participate in the discussions on United Nations \r\nreforms. On the basis of seeking agreement, while \r\nputting aside differences and ensuring inclusiveness, \r\nwe support a reform programme that reflects the \r\ngreatest consensus, gains the broadest possible support \r\nand helps to preserve the unity of Member States and \r\nthe long-term development of the United Nations.\r\nNext year will mark the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe founding of the United Nations, as well as that of \r\nthe victory of the world war against fascism. China will \r\nwork with all Member States. We firmly support and \r\nadopt a multilateral approach that jointly safeguards the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the basic rules governing international \r\nrelations.\r\n14-55823 11/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nWe will further enhance our support for the work of \r\nthe United Nations, be more actively engaged in United \r\nNations activities in all fields, continuously promote \r\nUnited Nations efforts and make a greater contribution \r\nto building a harmonious world of lasting peace and \r\ncommon prosperity.\r\nMr. Tin (Myanmar): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the members of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nnamely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, the \r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my \r\nown country, Myanmar.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, contained in document A/69/1. The \r\nreport provides a comprehensive and detailed overview \r\nof the achievements and challenges of the Organization \r\non a wide spectrum of issues of common interest and \r\nconcern to all humankind.\r\nThe ASEAN Charter includes a provision \r\nexpressing the Association’s commitment to upholding \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw. Accordingly, ASEAN attaches great importance \r\nto the work of the United Nations and greatly values \r\nits cooperation with the United Nations. The Joint \r\nDeclaration on Comprehensive Partnership between \r\nASEAN and the United Nations, adopted in 2011, is a \r\nclear reflection of our commitment to strengthening \r\ncooperation with the United Nations. In that context, \r\nwe welcome the successful conclusion of the annual \r\nmeeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers with the \r\nSecretary-General and the President of the General \r\nAssembly on 26 September 2014 in an Assembly side \r\nevent.\r\nASEAN will submit at the current session its \r\nbiennial draft resolution entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and ASEAN”, which will identify \r\nareas of cooperation where ASEAN can help address \r\nthe challenges faced by the United Nations, such as \r\nsustainable development, climate change, peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights, the rule of law, disarmament \r\nand terrorism. We count on the continued support of all \r\nMember States. ASEAN looks forward to welcoming \r\nthe Secretary-General at the upcoming sixth ASEAN-\r\nUnited Nations Summit to be held on 12 November \r\n2014 in Nay Pyi Taw, Myanmar, to further strengthen \r\nASEAN-United Nations relations and to explore more \r\nareas of cooperation. We view the Summit as an \r\neffective policy tool and another opportunity to give \r\npolicy guidance to strengthen the partnership between \r\nASEAN and the United Nations.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General highlights \r\nthe substantial progress in the overall achievement of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while \r\nstressing the need to move forward to adopt in 2015 \r\nthe universal post-2015 development agenda, and the \r\nurgent need to take timely action on climate change. \r\nThe sixty-eighth session of the General Assembly set \r\na good stage for the post-2015 development agenda. In \r\nthat regard, ASEAN highly appreciates the dedicated \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General and Mr. John Ashe, \r\nwhich have resulted in significant progress being made \r\nin crafting a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda. ASEAN also commends the efforts of Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand welcomes the General Assembly’s adoption in \r\nSeptember of resolution 68/309, on the Working \r\nGroup’s report, as the main vision for integrating those \r\ngoals into the post-2015 development agenda. ASEAN \r\nalso shares the view that a concise set of ambitious \r\ngoals with the overarching objective of eradicating \r\npoverty and with sustainable development at their core \r\nmust lie at the heart of the agenda, which must take \r\ninto consideration each country’s context and level of \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThere is no doubt that climate change is one of \r\nthe greatest threats to a sustainable future. In that \r\nregard, we would like to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on successfully convening the United Nations \r\nClimate Summit 2014 on 23 September, a summit that \r\nattracted the attention of a large group of world leaders \r\non the issue of survival. ASEAN is also working hard \r\nto address the challenges posed by climate change, \r\nincluding strengthening the resilience of the ASEAN \r\ncommunity by effectively implementing the ASEAN \r\nClimate Change Initiative and the ASEAN Action \r\nPlan on Joint Response to Climate Change. ASEAN \r\nreaffirms the importance of adopting at the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change a \r\nnew global agreement applicable to all the parties in \r\n2015.\r\nSince the entry into force of its Charter, \r\nASEAN has made rapid progress in its institutional \r\ndevelopments in the area of human rights. Among \r\nthe highlights are the milestone adoption of the \r\nASEAN Human Rights Declaration in 2012 and of the \r\n12/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nDeclaration on the Elimination of Violence against \r\nWomen and the Elimination of Violence against \r\nChildren in 2013, following the establishment of the \r\nASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human \r\nRights (AICHR) and the ASEAN Commission on the \r\nPromotion and Protection of the Rights of Women and \r\nChildren. AICHR has conducted various programmes \r\nand activities in consultation and cooperation with \r\nthe ASEAN sectoral bodies and with the relevant \r\ninstitutions and external partners. Some results include \r\nthe completion of its thematic study on corporate social \r\nresponsibility and human rights in ASEAN and the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the workshop on human rights, \r\nclimate change and the environment, held in Myanmar \r\nlast month.\r\nWith respect to humanitarian assistance efforts, \r\nASEAN takes note of the record high amount of \r\n$474 million contributed to the Central Emergency \r\nResponse Fund in the year 2013. As South-East \r\nAsian nations are also prone to natural disasters, we \r\nwelcome the disaster risk reduction framework and \r\nthe United Nations Plan of Action on Disaster Risk \r\nReduction for Resilience. With a view to improving \r\ndisaster prevention, preparedness, response, relief and \r\nrecovery, ASEAN is in the process of implementing \r\nthe ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and \r\nEmergency Response as the main common platform for \r\ndisaster management in ASEAN, and it is enhancing \r\nthe capability of the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for \r\nHumanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management.\r\nIn the area of peace and stability, ASEAN is striving \r\nto maintain and promote the Association as a standard-\r\nbearer for regional norms of good conduct, particularly \r\nthrough the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in South-\r\nEast Asia. The Treaty is regarded as the key code of \r\nconduct governing inter-State relations in South-East \r\nAsia and provides a foundation for the maintenance of \r\nregional peace and stability. We welcome the growing \r\ninterest of non-ASEAN States in acceding to this \r\nTreaty.\r\nASEAN also attaches great importance to \r\nstrengthening the nuclear non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament regime with a view to maintaining \r\npeace, security and prosperity in the region. We \r\nare committed to preserving South-East Asia as a \r\nzone free of nuclear and all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, as stipulateded in the ASEAN Charter. \r\nIn that regard, ASEAN is committed to working \r\nclosely with the nuclear-weapon States on the early \r\nsigning and ratification of the Protocol to the South-\r\nEast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty without \r\nreservations by nuclear-weapon States. To that end, \r\nASEAN is exerting efforts to resume negotiations with \r\nthe nuclear-weapon States in a sideline event during the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly.\r\nASEAN shares the general deep concern over the \r\nrise of violence and brutality committed by terrorist \r\nand extremist organizations and radical groups in Iraq \r\nand Syria. ASEAN denounces all forms of terrorism \r\nand all acts of destruction and violence. ASEAN is \r\nimplementing the ASEAN Convention on Counter-\r\nTerrorism and the ASEAN Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction on Counter-Terrorism, which are aimed at \r\npreventing and suppressing terrorism by addressing its \r\nroot causes, disrupting terror networks and eliminating \r\nfinancial channels. In that regard, ASEAN Foreign \r\nMinisters recently issued a statement on 26 September \r\nin New York reiterating its support for Security Council \r\nresolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014).\r\nASEAN is striving for inclusive and sustainable \r\ngrowth. In view of the different levels of development \r\namong the countries that make up its membership, \r\nASEAN has been making efforts to narrow those \r\ndevelopment gaps through its initiative for an ASEAN \r\nintegration work plan. We would therefore welcome \r\ncontinued support from ASEAN’s dialogue partners, \r\nthe United Nations and other external partners in our \r\nefforts to achieve full regional integration.\r\nThis year, under the chairmanship of Myanmar, \r\nASEAN is speeding up its community-building process \r\nunder the theme of “Moving forward in unity to a \r\npeaceful and prosperous community”. The Nay Pyi \r\nTaw Declaration on the Realization of the ASEAN \r\nCommunity by 2015 has provided policy guidance aimed \r\nat ensuring the successful establishment of the ASEAN \r\ncommunity. We are now on the threshold of realizing \r\nthe dream of a politically cohesive, economically \r\nintegrated, socially responsible, people-centred \r\ncommunity by 2015 and beyond. Next year will \r\ntherefore be a milestone not only for the United Nations \r\nbut also for ASEAN member States. We are now setting \r\nour sights beyond 2015 and working on formulating \r\na post-2015 vision for the ASEAN community. We \r\nbelieve that ASEAN’s collective efforts at the regional \r\nlevel will contribute to the work of the United Nations \r\nin promoting peace, security and stability, as well as \r\nin contributing to inclusive and sustainable growth for \r\nall. I would like to conclude by reiterating ASEAN’s \r\n14-55823 13/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nresolve to strengthen its cooperation with the United \r\nNations in areas of mutual interest.\r\nMr. Och (Mongolia): I would like to express my \r\ndelegation’s appreciation to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his annual report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/69/1), which outlines the efforts of the United \r\nNations to address the unprecedented challenges facing \r\nthe international community and the progress made \r\nover the past year in delivering on the Organization’s \r\neight long-term priorities. My delegation will describe \r\nits position on most of the issues discussed in the report \r\nin plenary meetings and in the deliberations of the Main \r\nCommittees.\r\nAs we approach their deadline, there is every \r\nreason to say that the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) have produced notable results and made a \r\nglobal contribution to galvanizing action designed \r\nto achieve the agreed-on goals. Building on that, \r\nand resolved to pursue the unfinished business of \r\nthe MDGs, the Member States are now engaged in \r\nsetting the stage for delivering on and implementing \r\na transformative and action-oriented agenda beyond \r\n2015, with our sustainable development goals at its \r\ncentre. We commend the work and outcomes of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing and \r\nappreciate the challenges they have faced in striving \r\nto meet the aspirations of all Member States. We are \r\nnevertheless of the view that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process should explore every possible way \r\nto adequately reflect the issues raised during those \r\ndeliberations, including the special needs of landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMongolia is strongly committed to meeting \r\nthe MDGs. Our fifth national report on their \r\nimplementation concluded that Mongolia had already \r\nreached the targets on mortality rates of children \r\nunder 5, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, access to water and \r\nbasic sanitation and new information communication \r\ntechnologies. However, the important goals of \r\nhalving poverty, providing housing and ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability still remain the most \r\nchallenging for us, requiring targeted interventions and \r\nincremental efforts. Mongolia is also implementing a \r\nninth, national MDG, on strengthening human rights, \r\nfostering democratic governance, enforcing a zero-\r\ntolerance policy for corruption and emphasizing the \r\ncross-cutting importance of good governance and \r\nthe rule of law in socioeconomic development and \r\nenvironmental sustainability. In the year ahead, the \r\nGovernment is committed to accelerating its progress \r\nand implementing effective policies for achieving \r\nthose MDGs that are are close to their 2015 target and \r\nthose that are lagging behind, particularly on poverty \r\nreduction.\r\nAs a country that is experiencing effects of climate \r\nchange, land degradation, desertification, deforestation \r\nand drought that pose a potentially permanent threat \r\nto its sustainable development, Mongolia fully supports \r\nand appreciates the Secretary-General’s leadership \r\nin catalysing global action on climate change. We \r\ncommend the recent Climate Summit, which brought \r\nworld leaders together to announce their national \r\nambitions and called for bold action and strong political \r\nmobilization in order to reduce the emission gap, pledge \r\nto meet the 2°C scenario and reach a meaningful legal \r\nagreement in 2015. \r\nIn that context, Mongolia supports the carbon \r\npricing initiative and the New York Declaration on \r\nForests, aimed at combating deforestation. This year, the \r\nParliament of Mongolia adopted a green development \r\nstrategy designed to enhance low-emission and \r\nclimate-resilient principles for future economic growth \r\nin Mongolia. By 2030 we aim to reduce greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions in the energy sector by 20 per cent, through \r\nincreased energy efficiency and by ensuring that the \r\nrenewable-energy share of our total energy production \r\nis at 20 per cent by 2020 and 30 per cent by 2030. \r\nFurthermore, we have set ourselves the ambitious goal \r\nof becoming a global port hub for renewable energy in \r\nthe region, since we have a rare opportunity to create \r\na sustainable energy network through a combination \r\nof energy sources that include coal, solar, wind and \r\nhydropower.\r\nMy delegation fully shares the deep concerns \r\nexpressed in the Secretary-General’s report about the \r\nglobal security environment’s threats to international \r\npeace and the importance of conflict prevention and \r\nmediation. Wars, crimes, conflicts and atrocities \r\ncommitted by terrorist groups continue to pose threats \r\nto world peace and security. In that regard, Mongolia \r\nappreciates the efforts of the United Nations to resolve \r\nthe crises and conflicts in the Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nthe Central African Republic, Mali, Ukraine and other \r\ntroubled parts of the world. United Nations peacekeeping \r\ntoday is more critical than ever. As an active contributor \r\n14/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations, Mongolia \r\nunderlines the importance of the Secretary-General’s \r\nstrategic review of those operations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nappeal to the members of the Conference on Disarmament \r\nto live up to the international community’s expectations \r\nabout the persisting deadlock in the Conference and \r\nshares his concern. Mongolia and Mexico will co-chair \r\nthe first part of the 2015 meeting of the Conference, and \r\nwe call on all States to take a bold and decisive position \r\non working for meaningful agreement on disarmament. \r\nAs a country with a unique nuclear-weapon-free status, \r\nand as a firm advocate of nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation, Mongolia supports and is willing to \r\ncontribute to establishing new such zones, including in \r\nthe Middle East and North-East Asia.\r\nWe support the General Assembly’s call to ensure \r\nthat human rights are effectively mainstreamed into \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda and welcome the \r\nOrganization’s efforts in that regard. Mongolia is willing \r\nto share its lessons learned in advancing the rule of law, \r\nparliamentary democracy and legal reform. Following \r\nits successful chairmanship of the Community of \r\nDemocracies, Mongolia launched the Asian Partnership \r\nfor Democracy initiative and is preparing to host the \r\nfifth conference of the Freedom Online Coalition next \r\nyear in Ulaanbaatar. In November 2013 we brought \r\ntogether women parliamentarians from the countries \r\nof North-East Asia to discuss the increasing role of \r\nwomen parliamentarians in peace and development \r\nthrough education and opportunities to develop a \r\nNorth-East Asian regional network of women members \r\nof parliament.\r\nFor more than a decade, Mongolia has been actively \r\nadvancing education-related endeavours at the United \r\nNations. They include literacy initiatives such as the \r\ndesignation of 1990 as International Literacy Year \r\nand of 2003-2012 as the United Nations Literacy \r\nDecade and a literacy resolution first adopted in 1987 \r\n(resolution 42/104), as well as a resolution on education \r\nfor democracy first adopted in 2012 (resolution 67/18). \r\nBoth resolutions will be introduced again this year, \r\nupdated to reflect emerging challenges in the area, and \r\nwe count on receiving the same support from Member \r\nStates as in previous years.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the steps outlined to \r\nfurther strengthen the work of the Organization, and \r\nstresses the importance of resuming intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the question of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil during the main part of the sixty-ninth session.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to pledge my delegation’s \r\nstrong commitment to working with other Member \r\nStates and to express its full support for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s work to reform the United Nations and make \r\nit more efficient and relevant.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in French): \r\nThe Secretary-General has presented the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session with his report on \r\nthe annual activity of the Organization (A/69/1), which \r\nis full of information and analysis on the work that has \r\nbeen done and problems related to it, but also discusses \r\nthe challenges, opportunities, perspectives and paths to \r\nfollow in years to come. Cameroon is grateful to the \r\nSecretary-General and his entire staff, at Headquarters \r\nand in the field, for their work, which can sometimes \r\nresult in the ultimate sacrifice. We commend and urge \r\nhim to move forward in doing his job, which, although \r\nundoubtedly complex and difficult, is noble, exalted, \r\nuseful and beneficial to the advancement of humankind. \r\nWith regard to the report, I would like to emphasize the \r\nfollowing issues, which have an important and urgent \r\nbearing on our common future.\r\nFirst, we agree with the Secretary-General that \r\nclimate change is one of the top priorities of our time, \r\none whose harsh consequences our generation has been \r\nthe first to feel and will probably be the last able to take \r\nsalutary measures for the future of our planet. During \r\nthe Climate Summit on 23 September, we heard the \r\nvoices of representatives from States’ highest levels, \r\nfrom the worlds of finance, business, civil society, and \r\nfrom public and private groups, saying in unison that it \r\nis far past time to do whatever can be done to limit the \r\nrise in global temperatures to 2°C. There was a chorus, \r\ntoo, of announcements of actions already taken or to \r\ncome, but based on past experience, I am afraid that all \r\nthose good intentions may not be followed by concrete \r\neffort when the time comes and that in any case, such \r\nefforts are mere steps on a long road that demands we \r\ntrot or gallop if we do not want to end up benighted on \r\nthe way. \r\nWhatever happens, the next meetings of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, in \r\nLima at the end of this year and in Paris in 2015, are the \r\nfinal stages when the various stakeholders on this issue \r\nshould definitively enshrine in an ambitious and legally \r\nbinding instrument their shared willingness to save our \r\nfuture for all of us and for future generations.\r\n14-55823 15/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nCameroon is resolutely committed to that road, \r\nsince, like other countries, it is experiencing the impact \r\nof climate change. Our rainfall is steadily declining, \r\nespecially in our northern areas, bringing closer an \r\ninexorably advancing desert. The degradation of our \r\ncoastal ecosystems, owing to sedimentary silting and \r\nrising saltwater levels, as well as the accelerated drying \r\nup of Lake Chad, is creating many environmental \r\nproblems. \r\nThe measures the Government has taken to deal \r\nwith this serious situation include the creation in 2009 \r\nof a national climate change observatory to monitor and \r\nevaluate its socioeconomic and environmental effects \r\nand to propose preventive measures to mitigate and \r\nadapt to the negative effects and risks associated with \r\nsuch change. We have created a ministerial department \r\nfor the protection of nature and sustainable development.\r\nWe have established a Government environment policy \r\nbased on the outcome of a 2011 States-General session \r\non the environment, designed to improve our policy \r\ncoherence and governance structure. Since April, \r\nnon-biodegradable plastic packaging under 60 microns \r\nhas been banned.\r\nAt the subregional level, Cameroon has become a \r\nsignatory to various agreements, including the Treaty \r\non the Conservation and Sustainable Management of \r\nForest Ecosystems in Central Africa; an agreement on \r\njoint forest management and protection and a regional \r\nconvergence plan; and the Yaoundé Declaration, which \r\nincludes, among other things, adopting harmonized \r\nnational policies on forests and the accelerated \r\nimplementation of planning tools, in particular \r\nharmonizing internationally recognized and agreed-\r\non certification systems and developing the human \r\nresources needed to implement them. In addition, \r\nwe have strengthened actions aimed at increasing \r\nrural populations’ active participation in planning \r\nand managing sustainable ecosystems and creating \r\nareas adequate to their economic, social and cultural \r\ndevelopment, including sustainable mechanisms for \r\nfinancing forest development through income generated \r\nby forest activities; involving economic actors in the \r\nprocess of sustainably managing and conserving \r\nforest ecosystems; speeding up the process of creating \r\nprotected transborder areas and, lastly, strengthening \r\nthe sustainable management of existing protected areas.\r\nCameroon also fully endorses the African \r\nposition on climate change. The future agreement \r\nwe are awaiting on the issue should respect the \r\nprinciple of differentiation, among others, so as to \r\ntake into account different countries’ capacities and \r\nstages of development. Along with commitments on \r\nreducing greenhouse-gas emissions, it should enable \r\nus to strengthen our policies on adaptation to the \r\nconsequences of climate change. Countries of the North \r\nshould follow through on the robust commitments they \r\nhave made for public and private financing on climate \r\nchange in the countries of the South. Moreover, the \r\nfuture agreement must include equitable treatment, \r\nespecially for developing countries, concerning \r\nfinancing and technology transfer, specifically for \r\nthose in the Congo Basin, which indeed have taken on \r\nheavy sacrifices to maintain and regenerate the world’s \r\nsecond-largest forest reserve, at 22 million hectares, \r\nin Cameroon, which is the second largest after the \r\nAmazon. These are the lungs of the planet, thanks to \r\ntheir capacity to retain carbon and produce oxygen.\r\nIn his annual report on the work of the Organization, \r\nthe Secretary-General rightly emphasizes the issue \r\nof sustainable development. On that topic, we must \r\nremember that the major Rio+20 Conference defined \r\n“the future we want”. In that regard, it launched a \r\ncertain number of participative and inclusive processes \r\nthat are meant to formulate basic proposals in order \r\nto develop a post-2015 development agenda following \r\non the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nconcluded in 2000 and since implemented. Concerning \r\nthe implementation of the MDGs, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral carried out an assessment in his report, and \r\nhis conclusion was that their implementation had been \r\nunequal between and even within countries.\r\nMy country is no exception with regard to those \r\nmixed results. Like a number of African countries, \r\nCameroon has made considerable progress on the \r\neight MDGs, notably on educational enrolment, parity \r\nbetween girls and boys in education, the proportion of \r\nseats held by women in the national Parliament, the \r\nliteracy rate of youths between 15 and 24 years old, \r\nvaccination coverage, combating HIV and malaria \r\nand the mobilization of public resources. Progress \r\nhas been slower in reducing poverty; in employment \r\nopportunities, especially for youths; as well as in \r\nofficial development assistance, in part due to broken \r\npromises by certain development partners. \r\nThe lessons learned from such deficiencies should \r\nbe drawn on to build the post-2015 development agenda \r\non a more solid base. The Intergovernmental Working \r\nGroup established for that purpose has made a significant \r\n16/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\ncontribution that, combined with contributions from \r\nother processes, should allow the Secretary-General to \r\nprepare a synthesis report that will enable the General \r\nAssembly to launch negotiations at year’s end. The \r\nnegotiations should be participatory and inclusive, \r\ntransparent and consensual. Cameroon aligns itself \r\nwith the common African position formulated on this \r\ntopic. The ambition, therefore, is to eradicate poverty by \r\ncreating conditions within the State in infrastructure, \r\ntechnology, financing, training and management \r\nthat are needed for economic transformation, peace, \r\nprosperity and sustainable development, while placing \r\npriority on equity and social inclusion.\r\nAs President Biya underscored yesterday, \r\n6 October, at the opening of the sixtieth Commonwealth \r\nParliamentary Association Conference in Yaoundé,\r\n“The post-2015 agenda should devise new strategies \r\nto substantially improve the population’s living \r\nconditions. All players will need to demonstrate \r\nstronger political will, greater generosity and more \r\neffective, more concrete and more active solidarity. \r\nSuch are the demands of the interdependence of \r\nStates and unity of humankind on us. Without that \r\nadded spirit, development by the end of the new \r\nagenda may remain a distant goal”.\r\nConcerning issues of peace and security, the \r\nSecretary-General in his report analyses developments \r\nin a number of conflicts and hotbeds of tension, new \r\nand old, in different regions of the world. Cameroon \r\nappreciates the efforts undertaken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to reduce or eliminate those tensions. \r\nPrevention, dialogue, cooperation and the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts are the appropriate means to \r\nreach that goal. \r\nAs for other forms of threats to international peace, \r\nsecurity and stability - whether the terrorism of attacks \r\nor hostage-taking carried out by jihadists or Boko \r\nHaram, or trafficking of drugs or people, including \r\nmigrants; maritime piracy; poaching or other acts of \r\ntransnational organized crime - peoples and nations \r\nmust strongly combat all terrorist aspects by pooling \r\nefforts, initiatives and means.\r\nIn that spirit, Cameroon is working on various \r\naspects of peace, security and solidarity with other \r\nAfrican countries in general and with those of Central \r\nAfrica in particular to promote peace and security \r\nin our continent and subregion. For example, that \r\nis the case with Chad, Nigeria and the Niger, which \r\nare working to effectively combat the terrorist group \r\nBoko Haram, or with other brotherly countries such as \r\nGabon, the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, which are working against poaching, \r\ninsecurity and issues related to the forested area of our \r\nsubregion and to the circulation of small arms and light \r\nweapons.\r\nOur country supports and actively participates in \r\nthe Peace and Security Architecture of the African \r\nUnion. Cameroon has been chosen to host the logistical \r\nbase for the continental African standby force. We are \r\nalso participating in various security mechanisms under \r\nthe African Union Council for Peace and Security in \r\nCentral Africa or the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States (ECCAS) on issues of peace and security \r\nin Central Africa.\r\nIn connection with the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2039 (2012), on 24 and 25 June 2013 \r\nCameroon hosted a summit of the Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of ECCAS, the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States and the Commission of the Gulf of \r\nGuinea on maritime safety and security in the Gulf of \r\nGuinea. An interregional coordination centre with its \r\nheadquarters in our country was establishsed on that \r\noccasion. A year after the summit, the centre officially \r\nlaunched its activities on 11 September.\r\nCameroon has taken part in many peacekeeping \r\noperations under the United Nations, the African Union, \r\nECCAS or the Central African Economic and Monetary \r\nCommunity in various places, including Cambodia, \r\nHaiti, the Congo, Chad, Darfur, Côte d’Ivoire, Burundi \r\nand the Central African Republic, where one of our \r\nsenior officers has taken command of the military force. \r\nWe are also participating in training and capacity-\r\nbuilding for peacekeeping personnel, and Cameroon has \r\nestablished an International School for Security Forces \r\n(ISSF). We would like to thank our various bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners for the assistance that they \r\nhave already brought for all those initiatives and would \r\nlike to ask them once again for further contributions to \r\nstrengthen their effectiveness, in particular for the ISSF \r\nand the work of the Interregional Coordination Centre \r\nto combat maritime piracy and armed robbery in the \r\nGulf of Guinea.\r\nThe Ebola virus, which is currently raging in \r\nseveral African countries, is turning out to be a new \r\nand terrible threat to peace, security and development, \r\nnot only in those countries but in the whole of Africa \r\nand the world in general. That is why we welcome \r\n14-55823 17/18\r\n07/10/2014 A/69/PV.21\r\nthe robust measures adopted by the Security Council, \r\nthe General Assembly, the Secretary-General and \r\nnumerous bilateral and multilateral partners.\r\nWe also welcome the recent summit held here \r\non 26 September on the Central African Republic, a \r\ncountry neighbouring Cameroon. We fully support it \r\nin finding a solution to the triple crisis — political, \r\nsecurity and humanitarian — currently besetting it.\r\nWith regard to all the measures taken by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral that are explained in his report to strengthen \r\nthe management of the United Nations — for example \r\nthrough UMOJA, the development of information \r\ntechnology, the Capital Master Plan, the Enterprise \r\nResource Planning Programme and staff mobility — we \r\nsupport them all in general insofar as most of them have \r\nbeen considered and adopted by the General Assembly \r\nagainst the backdrop of the recommendations of the Fifth \r\nCommittee and its deliberative and monitoring bodies, \r\nsuch as the Advisory Committee on Administrative \r\nand Budgetary Questions (ACABQ), the Committee for \r\nProgramme and Coordination, the Board of Auditors, \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit and the Committee on \r\nConferences, to just name a few.\r\nWe encourage the Secretary-General to consider, \r\nwith all due attention, relations with the various staff \r\nassociations in order to ensure that they are dealt \r\nwith in line with the provisions of their statutes, as \r\nwell as the provisions of the General Assembly. The \r\nSecretary-General customarily stresses that he leads by \r\nexample and that the staff is the most precious asset \r\nof the Organizaton. We fully share that point of view, \r\nand in that light the Fifth Committee and the ACABQ \r\nmust consider the various reports submitted to them \r\nat the current session on the management of human \r\nresources according to a customary understanding of \r\nthe competent administrative or budgetary committee.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker on the debate on this item.\r\nSeveral representatives have requested speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\n5 minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Bishnoi (India): I take the f loor in exercise of \r\nour right of reply to respond to the reference made by \r\nthe representative of Pakistan.\r\nIt is a matter of deep regret that Pakistan has \r\nviolated the ceasefire and that their unprovoked fighting \r\nhas led to the loss of civilian lives on the Indian side. \r\nSix persons have been killed and 50 injured. Firing \r\non innocent civilians by Pakistan will only hamper \r\nthe normalization of relations. The onus of creating a \r\npositive environment is on Pakistan, which is utterly \r\nfailing to do so.\r\nLet everyone be assured that our armed forces \r\nand paramilitary forces are fully ready, and they will \r\nrespond to provocations.\r\nMr. Munir (Pakistan): I also take the f loor in \r\nexercise of our right of reply, in response to the \r\nstatement just made by the representative of India.\r\nFor seven days, Indian security forces have been \r\nfiring and shelling across the Line of Control and the \r\nworking boundary. Yesterday was Eid day in Pakistan. \r\nBut Indian forces, in complete disregard of the festive \r\nevent, carried out the fire and put four innocent lives to \r\ndeath. On the Eid day, when Muslims celebrate the spirit \r\nof sacrifice, Indian forces played havoc with the lives \r\nof four families whose dear ones embraced Shahadat.\r\nIt is sad that the Indian Government has not been \r\nable to restrain its forces despite strong diplomatic \r\nprotest by Pakistan. We call upon the Indian \r\nGovernment to immediately cease fire and shelling \r\nand help us preserve tranquillity. The Government of \r\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been exercising the \r\nutmost restrain and responsibility. We also extended a \r\nhand of friendship to India. However, first, the abrupt \r\ncancellation of the foreign secretary-level talks and now \r\nthis unprovoked firing, are a cause of deep concern. We \r\nhope that the Indian side will give peace a chance.\r\nMr. Bishnoi (India): Regrettably, the representative \r\nof Pakistan has once again taken the f loor. We reject \r\nall the untenable and unsolicited remarks made by \r\nPakistan.\r\nMr. Munir (Pakistan): There is no need to repeat \r\nwhat I have just said. The ceasefire on the Line of \r\nControl and the working boundary must be preserved \r\nin the larger interest of the region and the peoples of \r\nthe two countries. In that regard, we once again ask for \r\nrestraint from the Indian Government and its security \r\nforces, and we also call for the United Nations Military \r\nObserver Group in India and Pakistan to be enabled to \r\nplay its role in monitoring the ceasefire and securing \r\n18/18 14-55823\r\nA/69/PV.21 07/10/2014\r\npeace and tranquillity, not only on the line of control \r\nbut also on the working boundary.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\ncontained in document A/69/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of item 108.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.05 p.m.\r\n"
