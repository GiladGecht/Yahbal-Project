The positions of delegations \r\nregarding the recommendations of the Fifth Committee \r\nhave been made clear in the Committee and are reflected \r\nin the relevant official records. May I remind members \r\nthat, under paragraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General \r\nAssembly agreed that\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered \r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a \r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its \r\nvote only once, i.e., either in the Committee or in \r\nplenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in \r\nplenary meeting is different from its vote in the \r\nCommittee.”\r\nMay I remind delegations that, also in accordance \r\nwith decision 34/401, explanations of vote are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Fifth Committee, unless \r\nnotified otherwise in advance.\r\nAgenda item 132\r\nProgramme budget for the biennium 2014-2015\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/69/422)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a \r\ndraft resolution recommended by the Fifth Committee \r\nin paragraph 6 of its report. The Assembly will take \r\na decision on the draft resolution entitled “United \r\nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response”. The \r\nCommittee adopted the draft resolution without a vote. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 69/3).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 132.\r\nAgenda item 136 (continued)\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/69/428)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the \r\nFifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report (A/69/428). \r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution, \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.22\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n22nd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 9 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

I wish to state my understanding \r\nof the discontent felt by of the delegations that were \r\nunable to deliver their statements within the designated \r\ntime frame at that important gathering. The Secretariat \r\nis also fully aware of the concerns raised by those \r\ndelegations, and it is indeed regrettable that a large \r\nnumber of Member States were unable to speak at that \r\nmeeting.\r\nIn light of what happened, I have convened this \r\nplenary meeting today under sub-item (b) of agenda \r\nitem 13, entitled “Follow-up to the Programme of \r\nAction of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development”, earlier than scheduled in order to \r\nprovide an additional opportunity for Member States \r\nto further deliberate on the topic and to have their \r\nstatements entered into the record.\r\nMr. Bamba (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank you, Mr. President, and express the \r\ngratitude of the Ivorian delegation for the resumption \r\nof this debate. It gives Member States that could not \r\nexpress themselves on 22 September at the twenty-\r\nninth special session, on the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), held in Cairo in 1994, the \r\nopportunity to do so today. Côte d’Ivoire would \r\ntherefore like to make its contribution to the follow-\r\nup to the implementation of the commitments made  in \r\nCairo to give appropriate responses to the persistent \r\nproblems of population and development.\r\nMy country has made  significant progress in key \r\nareas of the Programme of Action, although those \r\nadvances were slowed down by the decade of crisis \r\nthat the country experienced. In the area of education, \r\nfor example, Côte d’Ivoire’s march towards universal \r\neducation has resulted in an increase in primary school \r\ngross enrolment, which rose from less than 72 per cent \r\nin 1998 to 94.7 per cent in 2013, with a parity index that \r\nincreased by 41 per cent. Furthermore, the Government \r\nhas just adopted a measure aimed at making primary \r\nschool attendance mandatory from the age of six, \r\nstarting with the 2015-2016 school year.\r\nWith regard to health, efforts undertaken in the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS have allowed us to lower its \r\nprevalence rate to 3.7 per cent in 2012, as against 4.7 per \r\ncent in 2005. The child mortality rate for children under \r\n5 years fell by 27 per cent, going from 149.5 per 1,000 \r\nin 1994 to 108 per 1,000 in 2012. Maternal mortality, \r\nafter falling from 597 in 1994 to 543 per 100,000 live \r\nbirths in 2005, unfortunately had an increase to 614 \r\ndeaths per 100,000 live births in 2012.\r\nThe prevalence of modern contraceptives nearly \r\ntripled, from 5.7 per cent in 1994 to 14 per cent in 2012. \r\nUnmet needs for family planning, though still high, are \r\nclearly decreasing. Those results and others derive from \r\nthe institutional reforms and operational interventions \r\naimed at putting the population at the centre of the \r\ndevelopment process. Thus, several laws have been \r\npromulgated, and several strategic documents have also \r\nbeen made  operational.\r\nThe demographic profile of Côte d’Ivoire is \r\nmarked by a high fertility rate, estimated at 5 children \r\nper female in 2012, with adolescent girls contributing \r\n13 per cent of that figure. The population growth rate of \r\n2.7 per cent remains one of the highest in the world. The \r\ndropout rate in school also remains high, especially for \r\ngirls, because of poverty, sociocultural problems and \r\nthe scourge of early pregnancies. Furthermore, the \r\ncombined effects of climate change, with the resulting \r\ndrop in rainfall, water supplies and forest cover, have \r\nfurther impoverished the population, created food \r\ninsecurity and worsened public health problems.\r\n14-56244 3/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nWith a view to facing those challenges, the Ivorian \r\nGovernment is working to be able to offer universal \r\nhealth coverage so as to provide the public with better \r\naccess to health services, increase the efficiency and \r\navailability of the health system, increase the access of \r\nyouth and women to reproductive and family planning \r\nhealth services, and continue the far-reaching national \r\nprogramme, entitled “Zero pregnancies in the schools”, \r\nnow under way.\r\nCôte d’Ivoire is active in building the foundations \r\nof its successful emergence in 2020. An important pillar \r\nwill be the effort to improve the demographic dividend \r\nby means of the necessary strategic investments for a \r\nstrong and prosperous economy. My country is delighted \r\nwith the efforts already under way on the part of the \r\ninternational community, and invites it to increase \r\nits efforts with a view to achieving the goals agreed \r\nupon on the issues of population and development at \r\nthe major international conferences and international \r\nmeetings.\r\nOur common will to build a more just and equitable \r\nworld depends indisputably on promoting human rights. \r\nIn that regard, Côte d’Ivoire is committed to respecting \r\nthe rights of the individual without exception. My \r\ndelegation thus reaffirms the commitments that my \r\ncountry has made, both internationally and regionally, \r\nin accordance with our institutional and regulatory \r\nprovisions, our development priorities, our customs, \r\ncultures and beliefs. \r\nFrom that point of view, we welcome the report \r\nof the Secretary-General entitled “Follow-up to the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development beyond 2014” \r\n(A/69/62). Given our concern about the promotion of \r\nsustainable development, my country reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to the implementation beyond 2014 of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action and sincerely hopes that \r\nthe well-being of humankind will be at the core of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nMr. Laram (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): We welcome \r\nthis important meeting, which gives us an opportunity \r\nto express our opinions regarding the holding two weeks \r\nago of a special session of the General Assembly on \r\nthe integrated and coordinated implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD).\r\nAs an international community, we have highlighted \r\ndevelopment and implementation and the progress \r\nachieved so far. Regrettably, my country still has gaps \r\nwith respect to implementation of the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action. We are facing challenges and inequalities of \r\na socioeconomic nature. \r\nMany people live in abject poverty throughout \r\nthe world, which is a major challenge that undermines \r\nthe development efforts undertaken. I would therefore \r\nlike to avail myself of this opportunity to highlight the \r\nimportance of the ICPD Programme of Action, which \r\nasserts that human rights and human dignity are a \r\nsine qua non for sustainable development. It is also a \r\nfact that we are facing a number of recurring global \r\nchallenges. We attach particular importance to the \r\nissues of development and population. In that respect, \r\nwe have made tireless efforts to implement the agreed \r\ndevelopment objectives. A number of indices and \r\nreports demonstrate that most of the objectives set in \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals will have been met \r\nbefore 2015.\r\nQatar has established a national comprehensive \r\nstrategy with respect to development. Our national \r\nvision for 2030 is to transform Qatar into a developed \r\nState that can protect its development and give \r\neveryone in our country, as well as future generations, \r\na high standard of living. Qatar’s national vision has \r\nproduced long-term results and has allowed us to create \r\na framework in which to develop national strategies and \r\nimplementation plans. The State adopted a population \r\npolicy in 2009. We have undertaken the implementation \r\nof that policy, striking a balance between population \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. We shall also seek \r\nto implement the sustainable development goals, as \r\nwell as the main elements of the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nWe reiterate today our reservations regarding \r\nsome controversial issues set out in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports (A/69/62 and A/69/122) that have to \r\ndo with follow-up measures for the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action. Those measures exceed what was agreed \r\nin the Cairo Plan of Action.There is no consensus on \r\nmatters relating to sexual orientation, sexual identity, \r\nabortion, health and sexual rights, reproductive and \r\nsexual health, or global sexual education. That is why \r\nwe would like to reaffirm one of the major principles \r\nof the Cairo Programme of Action - the sovereign \r\nright of all countries to implement recommendations \r\nthat are in line with their national legislations and that \r\nfully respect the various moral and religious values and \r\n4/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\ncultural backgrounds of their peoples, in conformity \r\nwith internationally recognized human rights.\r\nMuch remains for us to do, working together \r\nas Governments and individuals, to implement the \r\nobjectives and goals of the ICPD Programme of Action - \r\nto increase the standard of living of everyone by \r\nadopting suitable development and population policies \r\nand programmes that will help us fight poverty, achieve \r\neconomic growth, develop human resources and \r\nguarantee human rights for all. We hope that our debate \r\nwill yield positive, concrete results and comprehensive \r\nmeasures that will facilitate our doing everything we \r\ncan to implement the ICPD Programme of Action. In \r\nestablishing a post-2015 development plan, we need \r\nto focus on the issues highlighted in the Cairo Plan \r\nof Action, especially women, the elderly, youth, and \r\npersons with disabilities.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate that Qatar \r\nwill spare no effort to continue to honour one of its major \r\ncommitments, that is, respect for and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. We also want to restate our \r\ncommitment to implementing the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action, which is considered a major milestone or \r\nreference point for all matters relating to population. \r\nOur commitment will continue even after 2014, and \r\nwe will implement the Programme of Action with \r\nfull respect for religious, ethical and cultural values \r\nand backgrounds and in accordance with our national \r\nlegislation.\r\nMr. Bishnoi (India): As we mark the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD), India remains \r\ncommitted to the consensus reached at the ICPD and \r\nsubsequent reviews. India has achieved substantial \r\ndeclines in infant and maternal mortality rates as a \r\nconsequence of targeted interventions to promote \r\ninstitutional deliveries, as well as a number of other \r\ninterventions relating to, for example, the provision \r\nof free medicines, diagnostics and nutrition. The \r\nproportion of institutional births has now reached \r\n85 per cent, and the Government is working to further \r\nexpand the programme.\r\nSecuring and promoting the health and well-\r\nbeing of young people, especially adolescents, and of \r\nwomen and children is a priority. Reproductive health \r\ncommodities and services, including comprehensive \r\nabortion care, are now among the 20 essential services \r\nof universal health coverage to be provided free of cost. \r\nBesides strengthening the financial commitment to \r\nhealth services, the State will maintain its coverage of \r\nthe 100 million women currently using contraceptives \r\nand is committed to adding still more women to the \r\nprogramme by 2020. Overall, our focus is on expanding \r\nhealth care for all, as well as on meeting the challenges \r\nposed by a changing demographic profile and the \r\ngradual shift of attention from communicable to \r\nnon-communicable diseases.\r\nIn education, our current focus is on improving \r\nquality, the expansion of secondary and tertiary \r\neducation, improving equity and accessibility for \r\ngirls and women, and skills development to improve \r\nemployability.\r\nWe have recently launched a national adolescent \r\nhealth strategy, which comprises the provision of \r\ninformation, counselling, commodities and services, \r\nand which will cover all our 250 million adolescents \r\nThe strategy realigns the existing approaches in order \r\nto focus on community-based health promotion and \r\nprevention. It identifies six priority areas of action: \r\nreproductive and sexual health, nutrition, mental health, \r\ninjuries and violence, including domestic and gender-\r\nbased violence, substance abuse and non-communicable \r\ndiseases.\r\nEnsuring gender equality, promoting women’s \r\nempowerment and combating discrimination and \r\nviolence against women remain a priority. We have \r\nadopted enabling legislative and policy frameworks \r\nfor the advancement of women and have undertaken \r\nprogrammes to generate awareness and sensitization \r\nin order to fight social prejudices and stereotypes. \r\nThe Government has launched a new rights-based, \r\nnon-discriminatory, adolescent-friendly programme \r\nthat reaches out to an adolescent population that is \r\n250 million strong.\r\nWe are firmly addressing the problem of violence \r\nagainst women. The amendments to the criminal law \r\nlast year significantly broaden the definition of sexual \r\nassault and harassment, include new types of violent \r\nbehaviour such as stalking, and so on, and aim for \r\ngreater accountability of public officials. The Sexual \r\nHarassment of Women at the Workplace (Prevention, \r\nProhibition and Redressal) Act of 2013 aims to provide \r\na safer work environment for women. Those measures \r\nsupplement the existing framework for dealing with \r\nthe crimes of trafficking, domestic violence and sexual \r\noffences against children. As part of a multisectoral \r\napproach to violence against women, and following \r\nup on our statement at the sixty-sixth World Health \r\n14-56244 5/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nAssembly last year, the Government of India worked \r\nwith experienced activists from civil society and legal \r\nand mental health experts and drew up guidelines and \r\nprotocols for the medico-legal care of survivors of \r\nsexual violence.\r\nIndia has been proactive in sharing its development \r\nexperience with other developing countries, including \r\nin the areas of health care and telemedical services. \r\nIndia is also a major source of cost-effective generic \r\nmedicines of good quality that are critically important \r\nto public health strategies in many developing countries.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report entitled “Framework \r\nof actions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2014” (A/69/62) identifies several \r\nchallenges and opportunities. Given the importance of \r\npopulation and development issues, we expect these to \r\nbe adequately reflected in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. The international community must enhance \r\nits cooperative and mutually supportive role. The \r\nprovision of financial resources, technology transfer, \r\ntechnical assistance, access to medicines and capacity-\r\nbuilding, especially in relation to developing countries, \r\nhave not reached optimum levels.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate our firm commitment \r\nto the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment and its Programme of Action and to \r\ntaking the ICPD agenda forward beyond 2014 to tackle \r\ncurrent challenges both nationally and globally.\r\nMrs. Bunge (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): Thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for organizing today’s meeting.\r\nThe Argentine Republic attaches great importance \r\nto the debate on population in the context of the \r\nthree dimensions of the sustainable development \r\nagenda - social, economic and environmental. We \r\nare here to renew and deepen our commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the Cairo Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2015.\r\nChallenges change and reality evolves, so policies \r\nand strategies also have to evolve in order to remain \r\nvalid. In that search, we believe that the first meeting \r\nof the Regional Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment in Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\nwhich was held in 2013, was of special importance \r\nbecause it allowed us to see how much progress we have \r\nmade in the implementation of the Cairo Programme of \r\nAction through substantive policies based on national \r\nstrategies. The virtuous process of change which \r\nthe countries of Latin America have experienced in \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural terms since the \r\nholding of the Cairo Conference in 1994 is reflected \r\nin the many policies, programmes and plans developed \r\nwith a view to achieving the highest quality of life for \r\nour populations.\r\nWe take this opportunity to welcome the report \r\nof the Secretary-General entitled “Framework of \r\nactions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2014” (A/69/62). Argentina was \r\none of the countries that contributed to the world survey \r\non the Cairo Conference beyond 2014, which provides \r\ntimely information for evaluating the considerable \r\nprogress achieved and the challenges that remain in \r\nimplementing the Programme. We confirm that human \r\nrights and equality are the core of the analytical approach \r\nunderlying the report, and we agree that investment in \r\nindividual human rights, capacity-building and respect \r\nfor the dignity of everyone, without any discrimination \r\nand throughout a person’s life cycle, are the basis of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe actions undertaken by the Argentine State \r\nsince 2003 show how fully aligned we are with the \r\nobjectives of the Programme of Action. In some cases, \r\nthe Argentine Government has set and achieved goals \r\nthat are more demanding than those set internationally \r\nand has registered significant progress in formulating \r\nand implementing public policies in all priority \r\nareas. The political will and the determination of the \r\nArgentine Republic to ensure in each decision the full \r\nexercise of human rights are reflected in the premise of \r\nhelping people to become agents for change.\r\nAmong the achievements of the Argentine \r\nRepublic in that regard we would note the Immigration \r\nAct of 2004, which represented a paradigm shift in \r\nthe Argentine migration policy, granting the right to \r\nmigrate, not migrate and return, as well as guaranteeing \r\nthe access of migrants to education, health and social \r\nservices regardless of their migration status.\r\nThe national responsible sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth programme, which was established by law in \r\n2002, guarantees universal access to health services, \r\nincluding sexual and reproductive health services, \r\nthereby closing gaps in accessibility to and quality \r\nof care. It promotes decision-making that is free \r\nof discrimination, coercion or violence, thereby \r\nenabling women to participate in decision-making, \r\n6/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nincluding on family planning,and helping to reduce \r\nmaternal and child morbidity and mortality, prevent \r\nundesired pregnancies and promote the sexual health \r\nof adolescents.\r\nLaw 26150 (2006), on comprehensive sex education, \r\nguarantees the right of all children and adolescents to \r\nreceive comprehensive sexual education and requires \r\nsystematic action on sex education throughout the \r\nentire public education system.\r\nThe cross-cutting social policy underlying the \r\nuniversal child allowance of 2009 has a positive effect \r\non education, health and gender equality and is of \r\ndirect benefit to the socially vulnerable populations. \r\nThe foregoing are just a few examples.\r\nFinally, we would mention the adoption of Law \r\n26862 (2013) on medically assisted reproduction, which \r\nguarantees comprehensive access to those practices \r\nand requires public and private social protection \r\nprogrammes, as well as prepaid medical care, to cover \r\nexpenses.\r\nWe are aware of the challenges that remain in terms \r\nof improving the quality of life of our populations and \r\nthe need to guarantee equal and equitable treatment for \r\nall. The results of the review undertaken by the United \r\nNations show that, despite the important progress made \r\nin reducing poverty and improving economic growth \r\nsince the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development in 1994, many countries still have \r\nproblems in terms of satisfying basic needs - decent \r\nwork, full employment and access to social protection. \r\nThe gains made motivate us to renew the commitment \r\nto continuing our work on outstanding issues. At the \r\nregional level, we rely on the Montevideo Consensus as a \r\nframework for national progress based on the paradigm \r\nof equality, inclusion and equity and a people-centred \r\napproach to rights, family and community.\r\nWe are fully committed to the implementation of \r\nthe Programme of Action, bearing in mind the regional \r\nreview and the recommendations for beyond 2014. We \r\nunderstand that that perspective brings indispensable \r\nelements for sustainable development and should be \r\nincorporated in the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nbased on the agreements achieved in the framework of \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals.\r\nArgentina has decided to continue to embody a \r\npolitical, economic and social model underlying a State \r\nthat is active and committed to the improvement of our \r\nreality in the quest for open, transparent and democratic \r\nsolutions.\r\nMs. Kiernan (United States of America): It is an \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the United States and to \r\njoin other Member States, United Nations agencies \r\nand civil society in renewing our full support for the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD), adopted in \r\nCairo nearly 20 years ago to this day.\r\nLet me begin by commending the work that led to the \r\nspecial session and that has informed our discussions. I \r\nwant to thank the United Nations Population Fund, the \r\nICPD Beyond 2014 secretariat and the United Nations \r\nPopulation Division for their many contributions. \r\nThe 1994 Cairo Conference changed the global \r\ndiscussion, illuminating what becomes more \r\nresoundingly clear with each passing year, namely, \r\nthat human rights, gender equity, global health \r\nand development must go hand in hand. The Cairo \r\ngoals remain the foundation of our work to promote \r\nreproductive health and rights and the empowerment of \r\nwomen and young people. As United States Secretary \r\nof State John Kerry pointed out, societies where women \r\nand girls are safe, where women are empowered to \r\nexercise their rights and move their communities \r\nforward - those societies are more prosperous and more \r\nstable, not occasionally, but always.\r\nThe international community has made impressive \r\nstrides, especially in education and in reducing maternal \r\nand child mortality, but progress has been uneven and has \r\nleft many behind. According to the operational review \r\nand the index report prepared for our discussions on \r\nthe ICPD Beyond 2014 (see A/69/122), many countries \r\nagree that those gaps require urgent attention. To make \r\nreproductive health and respect for reproductive rights a \r\nreality for all, we must get health services to those who \r\nstill lack them, including many women, young people \r\nand those caught in conflicts and crises. We must also \r\nstand up for every individual, regardless of his or her \r\nsexual orientation or gender identity, and protect the \r\nrights of individuals to make their own choices about \r\nsexuality and reproduction, and to make these choices \r\nfree from coercion, discrimination and violence.\r\nWe must do more to empower young people. Over \r\n40 per cent of the world’s population is under the \r\nage of 25. The choices they make will have profound \r\nconsequences for themselves and the world. Many \r\nmust navigate in treacherous waters. More than two \r\n14-56244 7/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nmillion adolescents live, for instance, with HIV. \r\nThree million girls each year are subjected to genital \r\nmutilation or cutting, and many will suffer lifelong \r\nhealth consequences as a result. Despite near universal \r\ncommitment to eliminate early and forced marriage, \r\none in three girls in developing countries will be \r\nmarried before she is 18. More than 15 million girls \r\nwill give birth each year. Those early pregnancies can \r\nkill, cause lifelong disabilities, cut off opportunities \r\nand extinguish hope. Many young mothers never finish \r\nschool. Their chance to learn and earn enough to lift \r\ntheir families and communities out of poverty may be \r\nlost forever.\r\nWe must take more concrete and decisive steps \r\nto reach our goal of greater gender equality and \r\nempowerment of women and girls. We must end the \r\nscourge of gender-based violence, both in peace time \r\nand in war time. We must end impunity for perpetrators, \r\nprovide services to survivors and prevent, not just \r\npunish, such human rights abuses. Integrating sexual \r\nand reproductive health services is also a priority. \r\nProviding maternal health care, contraception, and \r\nthe treatment and prevention of sexually-transmitted \r\nillnesses, as a package, is not just a matter of \r\nconvenience, it is a matter of life and death. We know \r\nthat providing family planning to all who want it could \r\nprevent nearly one-third of the estimated 300,000 \r\nmaternal deaths that occur every year.\r\nFinally, we must keep the eyes of the world focused \r\non achieving the ICPD goals beyond 2014. The two \r\ndecades since Cairo have confirmed that Governments \r\nhave chosen the right path, and we must continue to push \r\nforward. The post-2015 development agenda offers an \r\nopportunity for the global community to come together \r\naround a new set of development goals for the next \r\n15 years, and the United States stands behind of that. \r\nWe fully support a dedicated goal to promote gender \r\nequality and empower women and girls. Recognizing \r\nthat aspiration could be one of the most transformative \r\ngoals we could set in the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe special session has been an opportunity for \r\neveryone to reaffirm support for the ICPD agenda and \r\nto ensure that we address those issues in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. We must seize this chance, and \r\nthe United States is committed to doing its part.\r\nMs. Stener (Norway): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, \r\nSweden and my own country, Norway. We are encouraged \r\nby the overwhelming support for and commitment to the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) expressed by \r\nthe world leaders at the special session on the findings \r\nand recommendations of the report on the ICPD Beyond \r\n2014 review. We believe that the outcomes of the ICPD \r\nBeyond 2014 review and the special session provide the \r\nUnited Nations system and Member States with a solid \r\nfoundation for continued efforts to ensure universal \r\naccess to sexual and reproductive health and rights.\r\nAmong the many important recommendations for \r\nfuture work in this area, we would especially like to \r\nunderline the need for access to comprehensive sexual \r\neducation. The solid support from world leaders at \r\nthe special session is also a strong message about the \r\nneed to include universal access, on a priority basis, to \r\nsexual and reproductive health and rights in the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nWhile we recommit to the promises made in Cairo \r\nand welcome the enhanced commitments and efforts \r\nthat are being made to fully implement the ICPD, we \r\nbelieve that it is time to go beyond the Cairo Programme \r\nof Action. Every person has the right to be free from \r\ndiscrimination and to fully enjoy all human rights \r\nwithout distinctions of any kind, including those based \r\non sexual orientation or gender identity.\r\nFinally, on a practical note, the full statement \r\nthat Norway’s State Secretary planned to deliver on \r\n22 September has been submitted to PaperSmart.\r\nMs. Ravilova-Borovik (Russian Federation) \r\n(spoke in Russian): We are grateful for the convening \r\nof today’s plenary meeting. It is our view that the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action of 1994 remains the ground-\r\nbreaking reference point for inter-State cooperation in \r\nthe area of population and development. The priorities \r\nand strategic approaches agreed to 20 years ago are still \r\nfully relevant and vital.\r\nThe Russian Federation attaches great significance \r\nto the review of the implementation of the decisions \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), including in the context of \r\nagreeing on new priorities for global socioeconomic \r\ncooperation in the post-2015 period. We are convinced \r\nthat population issues should be adequately reflected in \r\nthe sustainable development goals being established. In \r\nthat context, the key challenge, we believe, is satisfying \r\nthe basic requirements of the population in terms of \r\naccess to health, education, food, water, energy and \r\nemployment. We are persuaded that it is counter-\r\n8/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nproductive to focus international efforts on promoting \r\nconcepts that are not universally supported or that \r\nrun counter to the social values of entire groups of \r\ncountries. Therefore, the Programme of Action should \r\nnot be reviewed but rather should serve in future as a \r\npolitical framework and provide guiding principles for \r\nthe work of the United Nations and of Member States.\r\nAchieving progress in demographic development is \r\na priority of the State policy of the Russian Federation, \r\nincluding in the context of sustainable socioeconomic \r\nprogress. Among our strategic challenges were \r\novercoming the demographic crisis at the start of the \r\n1990s and comprehensive support for the family. \r\nThe recent special session to review the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action was to become an optimal \r\nplatform for an open and comprehensive consideration \r\nof population issues with a view to advancing the \r\nglobal development agenda in the post-2015 period. We \r\ndeeply regret the fact that the Russian delegation and \r\nthe delegations of 60 other countries were not able to \r\npresent their population scenarios during the special \r\nsession. We hope that in the future that situation will \r\nnot be repeated. Member States can find the text of the \r\nstatement that was to have been delivered by the Deputy \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation \r\nat the twenty-ninth special session of the General \r\nAssembly on our Mission’s website. We understand that \r\nit will also be available on the websites of the United \r\nNations Population Fund and the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to confirm that the \r\nRussian Federation wants to continue dialogue with all \r\nour partners on the issues of population, and we are \r\nprepared to strengthen our multilateral cooperation in \r\nthat area.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): At the outset, let me thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his outstanding work and \r\nelaborate reports, “Framework of actions for the follow-\r\nup to the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development beyond \r\n2014” (A/69/62) and “Recurrent themes and key elements \r\nidentified during the sessions of the Commission on \r\nPopulation and Development” (A/69/122).\r\nThis year, we celebrate the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) with a comprehensive assessment \r\nof the status of the implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action as a critical opportunity to take stock of \r\nachievements and remaining challenges and to define a \r\nclear vision for future action. The forty-seventh session \r\nof the Commission on Population and Development \r\nand the twenty-ninth special session of the General \r\nAssembly on the follow-up to the Programme of \r\nAction on the ICPD, held on 22 September, provided \r\nappropriate forums for deliberations in that regard.\r\nHere, let me briefly comment on the status of ICPD \r\nimplementation in my country over the past 20 years. \r\nGeorgia, while going through a socioeconomic and \r\npolitical transition, has made significant progress \r\nvis-à-vis the ICPD Programme of Action. The priorities \r\nin the 2000 Cairo Plan of Action in the areas of \r\npopulation development, reproductive health, women \r\nand youth empowerment, protection of displaced \r\npopulations, an enabling environment for children \r\nwith disabilities and for the elderly have been reflected \r\nin our national development plans and legislation. \r\nHistoric gains were documented in reproductive health, \r\nincluding significant decreases in maternal, infant and \r\nunder-five mortality rates, all of which were basically \r\ncut in half. Abortion rates have also decreased by half \r\nfrom 3.7 per cent to 1.6 per cent, with a parallel increase \r\nin a contraceptive prevalence rate from 20 per cent \r\nto 54 per cent. Screening programmes for breast and \r\ncervical cancer were introduced in 2005, and universal \r\naccess to HIV treatment has been maintained since \r\n2003. Georgia introduced its f lagship universal health \r\ncare programme in February 2013. Whereas two years \r\nago, just half of the population was covered by public \r\nor private health insurance, today, every citizen of the \r\ncountry has a basic package of health services.\r\nThe expansion of social protection schemes has \r\nprovided a more reliable security net for socially \r\nvulnerable population groups, including families living \r\nin poverty, old-age pensioners, internally displaced \r\npersons and persons with disabilities. Last year, old-\r\nage pensions and social allowances were increased \r\nfrom the 2012 baselines by 50 per cent and 100 per cent, \r\nrespectively.\r\nWomen’s empowerment has also been given \r\nhigh priority in our national development agenda. \r\nGeorgia exceeded a 10 per cent threshold for women’s \r\nrepresentation in the Parliament in 2012. Women hold \r\nkey positions and ministerial portfolios in justice, \r\neducation and foreign affairs and lead the National \r\nSecurity Council and the Central Election Commission \r\nof Georgia. The economic empowerment of women has \r\nalso been visible since 1994, with 30 per cent of women \r\n14-56244 9/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nbeing primary breadwinners and 20 per cent heading \r\nbusiness enterprises.\r\nBased on an international assessment, Georgia \r\nhas been ranked among the countries successful in \r\ncombating trafficking, an advance achieved under the \r\nleadership of the National Coordination Council against \r\nTrafficking in Human Beings.\r\nIn response to young people’s special needs and \r\nbecause of the importance of investing in youth for the \r\ncountry’s sustainable development, a national youth \r\npolicy was adopted earlier this year and elaborated \r\nthrough a participatory process with the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund and UNICEF, based on knowledge \r\ngained from surveys of the sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth of young people and youth situation analysis.\r\nDespite those achievements, however, much \r\nremains to be done – and not just in my country, but \r\nin many parts of the world. We therefore endorse the \r\nurgency of the findings of the ICPD Beyond 2014 review, \r\nwhich show that, despite significant gains in poverty \r\nreduction and economic growth since the ICPD, many \r\nhave been left behind, with basic needs unfulfilled, and \r\nlacking meaningful work or access to social protection \r\nor public services in health or education, and that there \r\nare still significant barriers that prevent many people in \r\nthe world from enjoying their human rights.\r\nTo tackle the remaining challenges in my country, \r\nspecific measures are being taken, aimed at ensuring \r\nsustainable and inclusive economic growth, the benefits \r\nof which will be enjoyed by the whole population. That is \r\nemphasized in the socioeconomic development strategy \r\nof my country for 2020, which provides for demographic \r\nimprovement, equal opportunities for persons with \r\ndisabilities, the fulfilment of young people’s special \r\nneeds, the integration and participation of older persons \r\nin society, the further enhancement of gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women, and the improvement \r\nof the collection, analysis, dissemination and use of \r\nsex- and age-disaggregated data for informed policy-\r\nmaking. My country has taken several legislative and \r\ninstitutional steps to address human rights challenges, \r\nincluding the adoption of a national human rights \r\nstrategy for 2014-2020, a national human rights action \r\nplan for 2014-2015 and a new antidiscrimination law.\r\nIn conclusion, let me underline once again what \r\nmy Prime Minister said from this very rostrum (see \r\nA/S-29/PV.1), namely, that my country is proud to \r\njoin the international community in reaffirming \r\nits support for the ICPD Programme of Action and \r\nstands ready to further contribute to that effort. As \r\nreported in the record of the United Nations Economic \r\nCommission for Europe 2013 High-level Regional \r\nConference, “Enabling Choices: Population Priorities \r\nfor the 21st Century”, we support the human rights-\r\ncentred approach for the post-2014 programme of \r\naction. Furthermore, the experience clearly shows that \r\nonly a comprehensive, results-oriented, rights- and \r\nevidence-based strategic planning process that engages \r\nall concerned stakeholders and focuses both on access \r\nto and the quality of services can ensure progress \r\ntowards the equality, individual dignity, well-being and \r\nsustainable development of all nations.\r\nMr. Nekiguchi (Japan): I would like to express my \r\ngratitude to the President of the General Assembly, the \r\nstaff of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) \r\nand the other staff who contributed to the successful \r\norganization of this meeting. It is an honour for me to \r\ntake this opportunity to review the developments since \r\nthe 1994 International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), in Cairo, and to convey our views \r\nand position on the world beyond 2014.\r\nThe key to addressing population and development \r\nissues is without a doubt the empowerment of women. \r\nIt is women who play a vital role in the human life \r\ncycle, from birth through old age. But they are also \r\namong the most vulnerable members of society. They \r\nneed universal access to sexual and reproductive health \r\nservices as well as to information and education. It is \r\nessential to ensure their fundamental rights.\r\nThe ICPD Programme of Action has served as the \r\ninternational community’s guideline on population and \r\ndevelopment issues. Based on a people-centred approach \r\nfocusing on individuals, the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nhas promoted gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen and girls and has contributed to the achievement \r\nof human security, which is one of the most important \r\nguiding principles of Japan’s development assistance \r\nstrategy.\r\nJapan fully supports the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nand has long been committed to its implementation. \r\nImmediately following the Cairo Conference, we \r\nlaunched Japan’s Global Issues Initiative on Population \r\nand AIDS – a seven-year programme package, \r\namounting to $3 billion, to promote family planning, \r\nhealth education and HIV/AIDS prevention. It has been \r\nfollowed by various additional assistance packages \r\n10/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nfocusing on sexual and reproductive health, maternal \r\nand child health, and the empowerment of women.\r\nJapan continues to make contributions. The \r\nadvancement of the role of women has been and will \r\ncontinue to be one of the pillars of Japanese official \r\ndevelopment assistance. At last year’s session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, my Prime Minister, Mr. Shinzo \r\nAbe, highlighted “womenomics” (see A/68/PV.12) and \r\npledged to implement assistance in excess of $3 billion \r\nover three years that would place women at the centre. \r\nAs part of this pledge, Japan organized a symposium \r\nof the World Assembly for Women in Tokyo one month \r\nago.\r\nIn response to the recent humanitarian crisis of the \r\nabduction of schoolgirls by Boko Haram in Nigeria, \r\nJapan extended emergency grant aid amounting to \r\n$855,000 to UNFPA and other organizations to support \r\nthe abducted schoolgirls, their families and the affected \r\ncommunities. \r\nJapan is also among the most active countries for \r\ninternational advocacy. The Japan Parliamentarians \r\nFederation for Population was established in 1974 as \r\nthe world’s first non-partisan organization devoted \r\nto population issues. Since then, it has made every \r\neffort to advocate for population issues in close \r\ncooperation with its counterparts around the world. \r\nThe Government of Japan supports the activities of \r\ninternational parliamentarians through the Japan Trust \r\nFund at UNFPA.\r\nWe seek to contribute also to the fruitful debate \r\nformulating the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nJapan, in cooperation with the International Planned \r\nParenthood Federation (IPPF), recently co-organized \r\na side event entitled “Gender, HIV and Sexual and \r\nReproductive Health and Rights in the Post-2015 \r\nFramework” on the margins of the AIDS Conference \r\nin Melbourne, Australia. We renew our commitment \r\nto contributing to the successful implementation of the \r\nframework of ICPD beyond 2014.\r\nRegarding the world beyond 2014, the international \r\ncommunity must collaborate in order to cope with \r\nthe many remaining and emerging challenges. Today \r\nwe are faced with rapid demographic changes and \r\nan increasingly diversified set of concerns. In some \r\nregions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, nations \r\nare still showing high increases in fertility. Many \r\nyoung people are suffering from challenges such as \r\nunemployment, malnutrition and poor access to health \r\nservices. It is essential to continue to provide support \r\nfor those in need to satisfy their unmet needs, including \r\nsexual and reproductive health services as well as \r\ninformation and education.\r\nAt the other end of the spectrum, troublingly low \r\nfertility is found in some counties in regions such as East \r\nAsia and Europe. Many countries of the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations and other regions are, in turn, \r\nexhibiting such trends. Given such trends, the world \r\nis ageing. Even a region where the population is still \r\nyoung today will have to face an aged society in the near \r\nfuture. An ageing society without healthy longevity \r\nwill encounter many problems, including an increasing \r\ncost of social security. This may even threaten global \r\neconomic sustainability. Staying healthy even as we \r\ngrow older is therefore an important goal. If coupled \r\nwith healthy and active longevity, an ageing society can \r\nbe a blessing.\r\nThe proportion of our population that is aged has \r\nbecome the highest in the world; currently, one in four \r\npersons in Japan is older than 65 years of age. While \r\nmajor reforms have been and will continue to be planned \r\nto deal with the issues of an ageing society, Japan was \r\nranked first among countries in terms of healthy life \r\nexpectancy in both 1990 and 2010, according to a study \r\npublished in the Lancet magazine in 2012.\r\nThe realization in Japan of universal health \r\ncoverage as early as 1961 surely played an important \r\nrole in achieving the remarkable health and longevity of \r\nthe Japanese people. Universal health coverage reaches \r\nthe entire population, including the most vulnerable \r\nand marginalized people, of all ages and generations. \r\nBy eliminating disparities in access to essential health \r\nservices, universal health coverage can also contribute \r\nto inclusive economic growth.\r\nThe world beyond 2014 must deal with diversified \r\nand complicated challenges and tasks. The tasks of \r\nensuring maternal and child health, empowering \r\nwomen, girls and young people, providing sexual \r\nand reproductive health services, encouraging an \r\neconomically active population and supporting an \r\nageing society - all that rests on our shoulders. There \r\nmay be no miracle solution, but one key element should \r\nbe ensuring healthy lives for all at all ages. Throughout \r\nour life cycle, from childhood to adulthood and through \r\nold age, health and wellness are human needs. The \r\npromotion of a work/life balance and family-friendly \r\nenvironments, coupled with the implementation of \r\nmeasures for gender equality and appropriate health \r\n14-56244 11/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nsystems as seen through the lens of universal health \r\ncoverage, should be essential components of our \r\nstrategy. Japan stands ready to share its experiences \r\nand extend its support in that regard.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): Over \r\nthe past two decades, the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) has provided \r\na global road map for addressing population and \r\ndevelopment issues. Even today, the objectives \r\nstipulated in the 1994 Programme of Action seem \r\nvalid and pertinent to present circumstances and \r\nrequirements, though we need to be innovative as the \r\nworld population ages. I commend the forward-looking \r\napproach of the founders of this comprehensive and \r\nbalanced document.\r\nThe world is undergoing a historic transition in its \r\npopulation age structures, with fundamental impacts on \r\nthe economic and social lives of its inhabitants. In order \r\nto have healthy, educated and prosperous populations \r\nthat will be the engine and fortifier of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we must combat poverty. That means that \r\nwe must empower the poor and deprived and those who \r\nlive in vulnerable situations. Addressing the challenges \r\nrequires support for inclusive economic growth and \r\nsustainable development through enabled national \r\nsocieties within an enabling international environment. \r\nTo lessen inequalities, Governments should undertake \r\nmore robust steps in support of the equitable distribution \r\nof development gains. In the same vein, the provision of \r\nbasic social services should remain an integral part of \r\nnational and international measures to achieve poverty \r\neradication.\r\nMore than half of Iran’s population is under 30. \r\nThis young generation is thought of as providing a \r\ngolden opportunity, an asset for achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. At the same time, Iran’s population is \r\nrapidly ageing. These developments will have noticeable \r\neconomic and social implications. The shrinking of the \r\ninnovative young generation, whose members offer \r\nefficient expertise and energy, is deemed an obstacle \r\nto securing resilient and sustained development in the \r\nlong term. Following a few decades of successful low-\r\nfertility promotion policies, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran has recently decided to shift gears with a view to \r\nsustaining its population dynamics so as to ensure an \r\nempowered, educated and prosperous society.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has been successful in \r\nachieving many of the ICPD objectives and Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) even prior to their \r\ndeadlines. Iran’s achievements in the areas of decreasing \r\nchild and maternal mortality rates, enhancing access \r\nto medical services, including prenatal health-care \r\nservices, and providing those affected by HIV/AIDS \r\nwith care, treatment and prevention have received high \r\nrecognition from relevant international bodies.\r\nFrom a more general and sustained perspective, \r\nover the past two decades since the adoption of the ICPD \r\noutcome and its Programme of Action, Iran has worked \r\ncontinually to provide access to inclusive education \r\nto all boys and girls, even in the remotest parts of the \r\ncountry, as well as training and health care for all, \r\nwithout discrimination. The results are well reflected \r\nin relevant United Nations reports on the MDGs and \r\nthe ICPD goals.\r\nHowever, I would like to call the attention of \r\nthe Assembly to the illegal and inhumane economic \r\ncoercive measures and sanctions imposed against my \r\npeople, with negative implications for their enjoyment \r\nof basic human rights as well as for our national \r\ndevelopment agenda, in f lagrant contravention of \r\nthe spirit of the Charter of the United Nations and in \r\ndisregard for the content of the ICPD. The sanctions \r\nhave impeded timely and affordable access to the \r\nmedicine, vaccines, equipment, commodities and \r\ntechnologies that are necessary for providing health \r\ncare services. It is incumbent on the world community \r\nto stop such inhumane and illegal acts.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreports entitled “Recurrent themes and key elements \r\nidentified during the sessions of the Commission \r\non Population and Development” (A/69/122) and \r\n“Framework of actions for the follow-up to the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development beyond 2014” \r\n(A/69/62). However, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nuse in the reports of controversial terms and phrases \r\nthat do not enjoy consensus among the membership \r\nwill not be helpful in advancing our future discussions \r\non population issues, including the ICPD Beyond 2014.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that a \r\nsafe and healthy world is attainable only if mothers \r\nno longer lose their lives giving birth, only if children \r\nare no longer robbed of their childhoods, and only if \r\nevery girl and boy finds the doors of a school open to \r\nthem and enjoys easy access to quality education and \r\ntraining, health care services and nutritious food.\r\n12/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): Indonesia acknowledges \r\nthe great importance of the twenty-ninth special \r\nsession of the General Assembly as the culmination \r\nof the activities mandated by the General Assembly in \r\nits resolution 65/234. We take note of the findings of \r\nthe operational review, as reflected in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report entitled “Framework of actions \r\nfor the follow-up to the Programme of Action of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2014” (A/69/62). The review \r\nindicates that despite considerable achievements \r\nduring the 20-year implementation of the Programme \r\nof Action of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD), progress in some critical \r\naspects has been slow, unequal and fragmented, while \r\nnew challenges and opportunities have emerged.\r\nIndonesia believes that addressing the gap in the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action requires \r\nnew commitments, cooperation and concerted efforts \r\nby Governments at all levels, with the support and \r\nparticipation of all relevant stakeholders, including \r\ncivil society organizations and the private sector. As \r\none of the pioneering countries, Indonesia has been \r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action for \r\n20 years and is strongly committed to making real \r\ncontributions to the achievement of progress in various \r\nareas of population and development. Indonesia’s \r\nnotable accomplishments include a reduction in the \r\npoverty level from 17 per cent in 2007 to 11.4 per cent \r\nin 2013, thanks to pro-poor, pro-job and pro-rural \r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nIn addition, Indonesia has maintained its focus on \r\nexpanding access to basic services such as universal \r\neducation for 12 years, universal coverage of health \r\ncare and nutrition, and family planning; investing in \r\nbasic infrastructure such as sanitation and clean water; \r\ninvolving poor communities in poverty-reduction \r\nefforts and capacity-building for that purpose; creating \r\na social security system for the vulnerable and the \r\npoor; and reducing the significant disparities among \r\nthe provinces as well as among urban and rural areas.\r\nIndonesia, known as an international leader in \r\nfamily planning, recognizes the manifold aspects of \r\nthe interrelationship between population growth and \r\ndevelopment through the changing emphasis of the \r\nstated goals in family planning. That can necessitate \r\nshifting the paradigm away from a target-driven \r\norientation to one based on the concept of demand \r\nfulfilment. Increased attention to the quality of care has \r\nbeen seen as an effective way to address unmet demands \r\nfor reproductive health information and services. In \r\nso doing, Indonesia is pursuing some critical steps, \r\nprimarily by developing human resources, improving \r\ninfrastructure, developing medical protocols, \r\npromoting the integration of family planning services \r\nas benefit packages of national social health insurance, \r\nand tripling the budget for family planning over the \r\npast five years.\r\nIndonesia will reach the top phase of the \r\ndemographic dividend between 2028 and 2031, given the \r\nyouth potential of 65 million that will be contributing \r\nto long-term socioeconomic development. Indonesia \r\nis committed to preparing and protecting the rights \r\nof young people in health, education and employment \r\nas well as to encouraging them to become active in \r\ncommunity activities. The Government’s initiative to \r\ninclude the health and reproductive rights of young \r\npeople in the policy agenda through a programme \r\nentitled “Generation with a plan” has become a national \r\nmovement, which is rooted in family norms and values.\r\nThe empowerment of women, gender equality \r\nand the health of youth and children have gained full \r\nrecognition as integral parts of national development. \r\nThrough appropriate efforts, Indonesia has managed \r\nto reduce the infant mortality rate from 57 for every \r\n1000 live births in 1994 to 32 in 2012. In addressing \r\nthe maternal mortality rate, the Government has \r\nimproved people’s access to reproductive health \r\nservices, including maternal health services, by \r\ngradually providing universal health care coverage for \r\nall Indonesians. The national social health insurance \r\nsystem will cover 86 million Indonesians who are poor \r\nor at risk of falling into poverty, with premiums paid by \r\nthe Government. By 2019, all Indonesians are expected \r\nto be covered. Furthermore, Indonesia has increased its \r\nnational budget allocation for social security.\r\nAs an archipelagic country, Indonesia is at risk \r\nof bearing the negative effects of climate change. We \r\ncontinue to provide education, in particular to people \r\nliving in coastal and agricultural areas, aimed at reducing \r\nexposure to catastrophic climate change. We are also \r\nendeavouring to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \r\nby up to 26 per cent. Such efforts have increased \r\nunderstanding of the relationship between population \r\ndynamics and climate change and have improved local \r\ngovernment capacity to undertake mitigation activities \r\nand develop early warning systems.\r\n14-56244 13/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nThe special session is indeed timely, ensuring as \r\nit does that we learn lessons from the implementation \r\nof the MDGs and that the Programme of Action is \r\ninclusive and relevant within the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. We would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the report of the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals (A/68/970) and the \r\nAssembly’s adoption in September of the proposed \r\ngoals (resolution 68/309). The post-2015 process will \r\nalso provide opportunities to address new and emerging \r\nchallenges, ensuring that no one is left behind, \r\nbased on the principles of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nIndonesia would like to emphasize that the \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nshould be guided by the Programme of Action \r\nprinciples, including respect for national laws and \r\ndevelopment priorities, as well as religious and cultural \r\nvalues and diversity. We would also like to emphasize \r\nthat in order to successfully address the gaps in the \r\nICPD Programme of Action, its overall balance must \r\nbe preserved. Imposing the priorities or value systems \r\nof one country on another is not acceptable and could \r\nthreaten the hard-won 1994 Cairo consensus.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reaffirm our strong \r\ncommitment to the ICPD Programme of Action and its \r\nfurther implementation beyond 2014. Indonesia stands \r\nready to contribute constructively in the upcoming \r\nintergovernmental processes.\r\nMr. Sarufa (Papua New Guinea): Let me thank \r\nyou, Sir, for convening and presiding over this meeting \r\nat a moment when we mark the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) Programme of \r\nAction. We pledge to work with all stakeholders to \r\nensure that we do not regress and that instead, in the \r\ncourse of implementing the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nbeyond 2014, we consolidate the gains that we have \r\nmade in the two decades since the Cairo Conference.\r\nPapua New Guinea commends the excellent work \r\nthat has been done, as reflected in the scope and \r\ndepth of the report of the Commission on Population \r\nand Development on its forty-seventh session \r\n(E/2014/25-E/CN.9/2014/7) and the themes and key \r\nelements contained therein.\r\nThe ICPD Pogramme of Action is a visionary \r\nplatform whose relevance and importance today cannot \r\nbe overemphasized. Papua New Guinea therefore fully \r\nsubscribes and recommits to the Programme of Action \r\nitself and to its fundamental principles and objectives \r\nof stabilizing world population, promoting responsible, \r\nsustainable consumption and production, and protecting \r\nthe environment so that sustainable development is \r\npossible for today’s and future generations.\r\nFor my country, Papua New Guinea, a cornerstone of \r\nour development road map is a focus on people-centred \r\npopulation management and stabilization. It requires \r\nindividuals, especially women and girls, to take on \r\nleadership roles and to assume full responsibility \r\nfor improving their livelihoods through appropriate \r\nmeasures. This now forms an integral part of our \r\nnational sustainable development road map, known \r\nas Vision 2050, and other subsidiary frameworks, \r\nincluding the 2014 national strategy for responsible \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda now under \r\nconsideration must ensure that the important outcomes \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action are adequately \r\nintegrated in the new set of sustainable development \r\ngoals. If humankind is to have a sustainable future, the \r\ndrivers of population growth, poverty, environmental \r\ndegradation and inequality urgently need to be \r\ndecelerated at all levels, but that must be done in such \r\na way as to ensure that basic human needs are met. \r\nWe must be mindful that the natural environment can \r\nsufficiently provide for the needs of humankind but not \r\nfor its greed.\r\nWe also urge that there be intensified commitment \r\nand strong ownership on the part of leaders and \r\nall stakeholders in order to accelerate affirmative \r\naction — including through education, advocacy, \r\npolicy, legislation and enforcement at all levels — to \r\npromote the equality, empowerment and human rights \r\nof women, and also in order to ensure that there is zero \r\ntolerance for all forms of violence and discrimination \r\nagainst women and girls. Those are prerequisites for \r\nachieving not only the ICPD Programme of Action, but \r\nalso the post-2015 development agenda that we adopt \r\nnext September.\r\nMy Government values our women and girls, who \r\nconstitute half of our population, as equal development \r\npartners. We are ensuring that gender empowerment and \r\nequality continue to be a cornerstone of our responsible \r\nsustainable development. As a demonstration of that \r\ncommitment, Papua New Guinea has earmarked funding \r\nof $10 million this year for various initiatives, including \r\npartnering with the United Nations Population Fund to \r\n14/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nmake available 40,000 contraceptive implants as an \r\nimportant intervention measure for the health of our \r\nwomen and girls of childbearing age. That will be scaled \r\nup to $20 million by 2015. We are also partnering with \r\nour development partners by investing in upgrading \r\nvital midwifery skills, along with improving our health \r\nreferral system to address the problems posed by \r\ncomplicated pregnancies.\r\nOur Government has helped with the seed capital \r\nfor the first national women’s bank and microcredit \r\nschemes to involve our people at the grass-roots level \r\nand enable them to become owners and drivers of their \r\nfuture well-being. In addition, we are prioritizing \r\nsmall and medium-sized enterprises in a move to drive \r\ndevelopment forward. Furthermore, Papua New Guinea \r\nis also developing a national statistics development \r\nstrategy to provide a road map for continually \r\nimproving and updating our statistical information \r\ncollection and management methods in the interests of \r\nimproved decision-making. That includes embarking \r\non a national biometric identification card system to \r\nrecord and maintain population information on our \r\ncitizens.\r\nPapua New Guinea recognizes that sexual and \r\nreproductive health and rights are central to good health \r\nand well-being, especially those of our women and \r\nadolescents, particularly girls, and therefore important \r\nfor building our nation. We, the Member States, and \r\nthe United Nations collectively must ensure that every \r\nwoman has access throughout her life to a comprehensive \r\nand integrated package of high-quality sexual and \r\nreproductive health services, including modern forms \r\nof contraception and up-to-date sexuality education, in \r\norder that women’s sexual and reproductive health and \r\nrights may be fully respected and protected.\r\nFinally, at the Pacific regional level, in accordance \r\nwith the declaration on human rights of the Pacific \r\nleaders, we are making positive progress in strengthening \r\npolitical will and efforts to achieve gender equality, \r\nempowerment and women’s human rights, including \r\nthrough affirming sexual and reproductive health and \r\nrights. We recognize that the denial of women’s sexual \r\nand reproductive health and rights perpetuates gender \r\ninequalities, exacerbates poverty and intensifies the \r\nintersecting forms of discrimination that women and \r\ngirls face. We are making measured strides in our region \r\nto enable our women to increasingly have autonomy \r\non matters regarding their sexuality and reproductive \r\nhealth and rights, free from coercion, discrimination or \r\nviolence. Much more work remains to be done, but we \r\nare moving in the right direction. We are committed \r\nto working with our development partners on this \r\nimportant development issue, provided that it is on our \r\nown terms.\r\nMs. Dwyer (Ireland): I thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor this opportunity to deliver the statement that we \r\nhad planned to deliver at the twenty-ninth special \r\nsession of the General Assembly, held on 22 September. \r\nIreland aligns itself with the statement delivered on that \r\noccasion by the observer of the European Union (see \r\nA/S-29/PV.1).\r\nAt the outset, Ireland wishes to express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General, the United \r\nNations Population Fund and the other organizations \r\ninvolved in providing us with the relevant reports. We \r\nappreciate in particular the substantial scale and the \r\nparticipatory nature of those exercises and consider that \r\nthey provide a robust evidence base for our discussions, \r\nparticularly in the context of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nTwenty years ago, the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) established a \r\nglobal consensus that the recognition and fulfilment of \r\nhuman rights must be at the centre of any development \r\nagenda. As we mark the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action, it is clear that much \r\nprogress has been made. However, the reports before \r\nus also highlight the fact that aggregate progress often \r\nmasks significant unfinished business, particularly \r\nwhen it comes to women’s empowerment and in terms \r\nof access to sexual and reproductive health and rights.\r\nThe reports echo the conclusions from other forums \r\nthat inequalities, both between and within countries, \r\nstubbornly persist. Those who have been left behind \r\nby inequality and discrimination, particularly women \r\nand girls, must now be given our absolute priority. The \r\nreports also highlight the new challenges that we must \r\nincorporate into our response, including climate change, \r\nmigration, urbanization and the increased percentages \r\nof younger and older cohorts in our societies.\r\nIreland remains fully committed to playing our part \r\nin implementing the ICPD Programme of Action. Last \r\nyear, we launched Ireland’s latest policy for international \r\ndevelopment, which recommits us to the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights throughout our work. \r\nThe policy also contains an explicit commitment to \r\nthe Cairo Programme of Action, through the support \r\n14-56244 15/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nof efforts that reduce maternal and infant mortality, \r\npromote universal access to reproductive health care, \r\nincluding antenatal care, and provide family planning \r\nservices aimed at ensuring safe motherhood while \r\nallowing women to control their fertility.\r\nIn conclusion, let me state clearly that Ireland \r\nreaffirms our strong support for the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action. Twenty years on from Cairo, we are at a \r\ncritical junction. As we prepare to finalize the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, the principles, objectives \r\nand outstanding commitments from the ICPD and the \r\nBeijing Platform for Action simply must be at the centre \r\nof the development agenda in the years ahead.\r\nMr. Naivalurua (Fiji): The Fiji delegation would \r\nlike to thank you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\nmeeting and providing members with an opportunity to \r\ndeliberate on actions required under the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD).\r\nAt the outset, Fiji welcomes the priority theme \r\nthis year. The theme is most appropriate, as we now \r\nbuild on the important progress made, not only towards \r\nagreeing on the post-2015 development agenda, but more \r\nsignificantly in ensuring its effective implementation.\r\nAs we gather here 20 years after the ICPD, we are \r\nreminded of the global consensus on the integration of \r\ndiverse aspects of population, development and human \r\nrights. Fiji’s commitment to that global consensus, as \r\nwell as its subsequent reviews, is evident in our evolving \r\npolicies and programmes, as a result of which much \r\nprogress has been recorded in the last two decades.\r\nAlthough Fiji is faring well with the implementation \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action, much remains to \r\nbe done. Fiji is a small island developing State with \r\nover 300 islands and a population that is at once \r\nhighly concentrated in urban and peri-urban areas \r\nand dispersed among remote outer-lying islands. The \r\nadditional layer of existential challenges caused by \r\nvulnerabilities to climate change, frequent natural \r\ndisasters and environmental degradation poses a \r\nchallenge for Fiji in addressing all the core ICPD issues.\r\nThe juxtaposition of such stark situations in a small \r\nisland developing State brings with it unique challenges \r\nfor policy formulation and the implementation of \r\ntwenty-first century sustainable development solutions. \r\nThe availability and accessibility of sexual and \r\nreproductive health services are a major element of the \r\nsolutions, particularly in meeting the special needs of \r\nthe most vulnerable groups. The 2013 Constitution of \r\nFiji encompasses a broad range of civil, political and \r\nsocioeconomic rights, including the right to health and \r\nthe progressive realization by every person of the right \r\nto health-care services, including reproductive health \r\ncare.\r\nFiji also recognizes the importance of addressing \r\ninequalities and the empowerment of women and girls \r\nin equitable and sustainable development. On the eve of \r\nInternational Women’s Day this year, Fiji launched its \r\nNational Gender Policy, which is our guiding document \r\nfor mainstreaming gender issues across all sectors and \r\nwithin all spheres of national life. The Government \r\nof Fiji is committed to increasing women’s and young \r\npeople’s participation in decision-making and in \r\npolitical, social and economic processes at all levels. \r\nWe believe that that will be all the more important as \r\nwe look ahead to the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThis is an opportune time for our delegation to \r\nunderline the importance of data in development \r\nplanning. My delegation has noted in United Nations \r\nreports and documentation that statistical data from \r\nour Pacific Islands region are patchy or often listed \r\nas missing. We would like to stress the importance \r\nof securing timely and appropriately disaggregated \r\nand verified data in order to design evidence-based \r\nprogrammes and development planning. Adequate \r\nresource allocation is urgently needed for that purpose, \r\nand we urge cooperative action between Governments, \r\nrelevant United Nations agencies and other stakeholders \r\nto ensure the necessary capacity for effective \r\nintegration of disaggregated, verified population data \r\non our region.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate Fiji’s firm \r\ncommitment to the further implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and to addressing priority areas, \r\nparticularly where either the global review has found \r\ngaps in implementation or our own national analyses \r\nhave found greater needs. To ensure a robust approach \r\nto implementation, we recognize that mutually \r\nsupportive partnerships are crucial. We must garner \r\nresource allocation from all available sources and from \r\npartners that have clearly not reached optimal levels of \r\ncooperation to date.\r\nIt is imperative that national efforts be dedicated to \r\nbridging gaps in implementation, advancing the ICPD \r\nagenda and ensuring that ICPD issues are included in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. Governments and \r\n16/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nthe lead United Nations agencies must place them high \r\non their agendas if we are to maintain a sustainable \r\nplanet for the generations to come.\r\nMrs. Namgyel (Bhutan): I would like to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening the debate on the follow-\r\nup to the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development beyond \r\n2014, and for providing the opportunity for my \r\ndelegation to share our experiences, as well as the \r\nchallenges we faced, in implementing the Programme \r\nof Action.\r\nThe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) marked an important shift in \r\nour approach by placing the individual at the centre of \r\npopulation and development policies. It also focused \r\nour attention on relevant issues, including economic \r\ngrowth and sustainable development, empowerment \r\nof women, urbanization, education and technology. \r\nIn addition, as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreports (A/69/62 and A/69/122), significant gains have \r\nbeen made in population, health, life expectancy and \r\nthe protection of human rights, and an estimated one \r\nbillion people have been moved out of extreme poverty. \r\nHowever, much still remains to be done.\r\nIn my own region, the detailed analysis by the \r\nUnited Nations reveals that significant challenges still \r\nremain in the implementation of ICPD. And, while it \r\nis reassuring that the Programme of Action has been \r\nextended beyond 2014 and that that review process will \r\ninform and shape the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nmany of the challenges require urgent attention if the \r\nprogress and achievements since the Cairo summit are \r\nto be sustained.\r\nThe Secretary-General has aptly underscored the \r\nchallenges of inequity and sustainability in his report, \r\nas follows:\r\n“Our greatest shared challenge is that our \r\nvery accomplishments, ref lected in ever-greater \r\nhuman consumption and extraction of the Earth’s \r\nresources, are increasingly inequitably distributed, \r\nthreatening inclusive development, the environment \r\nand our common future.” (A/69/62, p. 2)\r\nIn that context, my Government is committed \r\nto ensuring that development is both inclusive and \r\nsustainable. Bhutan is committed to remaining \r\ncarbon-neutral even as we strive to overcome \r\nmultidimensional poverty and meet the special needs of \r\nthe most vulnerable groups. The continued support and \r\ncooperation of our development partners, particularly \r\nin building the necessary infrastructure and our \r\nproductive capacities, will be crucial to our success.\r\nBhutan is experiencing rapid demographic change. \r\nWith about 65 per cent of its population in the 25-and-\r\nunder age group, the potential for a demographic \r\ndividend is at its peak. Access to quality education and \r\nvocational training that are responsive to the demands \r\nof our social and economic development process is \r\ntherefore a key priority. The Government has been \r\nincreasingly engaging the private sector to create \r\nthe necessary jobs. Skills development, promotion of \r\nforeign direct investment and development of small \r\nand medium enterprises are part of our endeavours to \r\nenhance employment opportunities for the youth.\r\nRapid urbanization due to rural-urban migration \r\nhas proved to be an increasingly complex challenge for \r\nBhutan. With 60 per cent of our population still in rural \r\nareas, the pace of urbanization will inevitably intensify \r\nin the near future and outpace our current capacity \r\nto provide the necessary basic infrastructure and \r\npublic services to urban residents. Ensuring access to \r\nland, housing, water, sanitary and waste management \r\nservices and livelihood, particularly for the urban poor, \r\nare new dimensions to the development challenges that \r\nwe face.\r\nGender equality, equity and the empowerment of \r\nwomen must continue to receive the highest priority \r\nif we are to realize the full potential of the ICPD. In \r\nthat regard, Bhutan continues to promote women’s \r\nrights and facilitate their full participation in the \r\nsocioeconomic development and the political and \r\ndecision-making processes. The current five-year \r\nplan — the eleventh — has placed high priority on \r\ngender-based monitoring and data generation, as well \r\nas interventions to promote gender equality in local \r\ngovernance. It will address visible gender gaps in the \r\nareas of education, employment, political representation \r\nand violence against women.\r\nWe also note and welcome the strong role that can \r\nbe played by civil society in realizing the ICPD agenda, \r\nand we have taken concrete measures to encourage \r\nits participation. While we had just few civil society \r\norganizations in 1994, Bhutan now has 38 registered, \r\nconsisting of 29 public benefit organizations and \r\n9 mutual benefit organizations. I take this opportunity \r\nto acknowledge the support of all our development \r\npartners and the efforts of United Nations Population \r\nFund and the Commission on Population and \r\n14-56244 17/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nDevelopment towards the achievement of the goals and \r\nobjectives of the Programme of Action.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Bhutan \r\nremains resolute in its commitment to the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action and to further incorporating \r\nall its aspects into our national planning process. \r\nWe hope that our renewed political commitment to \r\nthat Programme of Action will be backed by a strong \r\ncommitment from our development partners to provide \r\nthe financial and technical assistance that are necessary \r\nfor the full achievement of its goals and objectives. My \r\ndelegation looks forward to working to ensure that the \r\nICPD Programme of Action remains a high priority in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): New Zealand \r\nwelcomed the twenty-ninth special session to review \r\nprogress towards implementing the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nagenda. We particularly thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nproviding this occasion to ensure that those who lacked \r\nthe opportunity to speak on the issue during the special \r\nsession have the chance to air their views in the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe ICPD review acknowledges significant \r\nprogress since 1994, but there is still much more to be \r\ndone if the vision of the ICPD Programme of Action is \r\nto be realized, particularly for women, young people \r\nand marginalized groups. The ICPD commitments are \r\nthe crucial foundation for a universally recognized, \r\nrelevant and sustainable development agenda.\r\nGlobally, women remain subject to violence and \r\nharmful practices that negatively affect their health and \r\ntheir human rights. In New Zealand and in our Pacific \r\nneighbourhood we face high rates of violence against \r\nwomen and must ensure that all survivors of violence \r\nhave immediate and safe access to critical services. \r\nWe must also focus even more on reducing violence \r\nby involving men and boys in violence-prevention \r\ninitiatives.\r\nWorldwide, 220 million women still have unmet \r\ncontraception needs. All women should be entitled to \r\naccurate information and counselling on a range of \r\naffordable, accessible and high-quality contraceptive \r\nmethods. In New Zealand, new contraceptive \r\ntechnologies have resulted in significantly improved \r\naccess. In 2010, for example, our Government increased \r\naccess to long-acting reversible contraception by fully \r\nsubsidizing contraceptive implants.\r\nDespite progress, a key challenge still facing New \r\nZealand is the persistence of ethnic disparities, with \r\nMáori and Pacific populations disproportionately \r\naffected by negative sexual and reproductive health \r\noutcomes. We must ensure that indigenous people \r\nreceive appropriate services, and, importantly, we \r\nmust address the social and economic factors that \r\ndisadvantage indigenous people.\r\nNew Zealand is also focused on assisting the \r\nPacific region to make progress under the ICPD. I \r\ntherefore listened with great interest and support to \r\nthe statements made a short time ago by Papua New \r\nGuinea and Fiji. That assistance includes supporting \r\nkey multilateral organizations that work in the region, \r\nsuch as the United Nations Population Fund, the \r\nInternational Planned Parenthood Federation and the \r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS.\r\nWe endorse the findings of the ICPD Beyond \r\n2014 review, and we believe the actions it identifies \r\nare vital to achieving inclusive, non-discriminatory \r\nand equitable access to services, education and \r\ninformation. For those reasons, New Zealand remains \r\nfirmly committed to working with Member States to \r\nensure that the post-2015 agenda and the ICPD Beyond \r\n2014 processes promote inclusive development. Above \r\nall, we will work to ensure that no one is left behind.\r\nMs. Stone (Australia): The issues covered by the \r\nfollow-up to the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) are \r\ncentral to global efforts to achieve a peaceful, stable \r\nand prosperous world and are at the core of our human \r\nexperience. While there has been some good progress \r\nin implementing the Programme of Action, it is an \r\noutrage that on the twentieth anniversary of the ICPD \r\nwe are still struggling to ensure fundamental human \r\nrights for women and girls, to protect women and girls \r\nfrom discrimination and violence in all their forms, and \r\nto prevent early marriage and early pregnancy. Not only \r\nmust we ensure those rights and protections, but we \r\nmust address the reality that women and children are \r\nalso bearing the brunt of increasingly violent conflict \r\nand protracted humanitarian crises around the world.\r\nWomen and children are receiving barbaric \r\ntreatment at the hands of the Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nthe Levant (ISIL), which is systematically targeting \r\nwomen and children with rape and other forms of \r\nsexual and physical violence. Unmarried Iraqi girls and \r\nwomen have been forcibly transported to Syria either \r\n18/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nto be given to ISIL fighters or sold as sex slaves, and \r\nthere are reports that an office for the sale of abducted \r\nwomen has opened in Mosul city.\r\nIt is 178 days since 273 girls were kidnapped by \r\nBoko Haram in Nigeria. And we are seeing increasing \r\nrates of early and forced marriage as a response to \r\ndisplacement and insecurity, with reports that rates \r\nof child marriage have increased alarmingly in some \r\nSyrian refugee populations. We cannot collectively \r\ntolerate those actions, which are not only terrible acts, \r\nbut also fundamentally undermine basic global norms \r\nand the rights of women and girls, which continue to be \r\nchallenged and questioned in far too many situations \r\naround the world. That is not tolerable in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nGiven those alarming trends, the ICPD Programme \r\nof Action is as important today as it was 20 years ago. \r\nWe must work together to advance the rights of women \r\nand girls, and not allow those rights to be eroded. That \r\nwill take commitment and action.\r\nAustralia commits to protecting and promoting \r\nthe rights of women and girls in all settings, including \r\nhumanitarian and conflict situations. Women and \r\nchildren make up the vast majority of internally \r\ndisplaced and refugee populations. The loss of their \r\nhomes, communities and social safety nets renders \r\nthose women and children extraordinarily vulnerable. \r\nWe will not let conflict or disasters become an \r\nexcuse to weaken our resolve to empower and protect \r\nthose women and children. In that spirit, Australia is \r\nproviding a further $2 million to the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund to continue its work to protect women \r\nand girls in Iraq. We must not forget that women and \r\nchildren in perilous circumstances still have rights, and \r\nthat those rights need to be protected.\r\nAustralia confirms its commitment to the \r\nInternational Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment Programme of Action, to the Beijing \r\nPlatform for Action and their subsequent reviews. And \r\nAustralia is committed to ensure that gender equality \r\nand sexual and reproductive health and rights are \r\nfirmly embedded in the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nAt the Asian and Pacific Population Conference \r\nin Bangkok, held in September last year, Australia \r\nand the majority of countries in our region supported \r\na forward-looking declaration that upholds sexual and \r\nreproductive rights for all. That demonstrates that as a \r\nregion we can continue to further the ICDP agenda, and \r\nwe can be even more ambitious in our aspirations under \r\nthe Programme of Action.\r\nAustralia’s commitment to women’s economic \r\nempowerment and leadership and to protecting women \r\nfrom violence is a priority for us in Australia and \r\ninternationally, through our diplomacy and our aid. \r\nAustralia has set a benchmark for its aid programme, \r\nmaking the commitment that at least 80 per cent of all \r\ndevelopment activities must have a gender-equality \r\nfocus. We are also prioritizing maternal and child health \r\nand family planning in our aid programme. Australia \r\nhas a dedicated ambassador for women and girls, \r\nNatasha Stott Despoja, who engages internationally \r\nto shift attitudes about the role, value and contribution \r\nof women and girls. We urge others to appoint such \r\nambassadors. That could form a powerful global \r\nnetwork working for the rights of women and girls, \r\nincluding indigenous women and girls, everywhere.\r\nWhile we face serious challenges, we can deliver \r\non the promise of the ICPD Programme of Action if we \r\ncontinue to shine a light on these important issues and \r\nwork together to deliver on our commitments.\r\nMr. Ferreira (Cabo Verde): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nelection, and to express the pleasure of the Government \r\nof the Republic of Cabo Verde in taking the f loor in \r\nthis follow-up to the Assembly’s twenty-ninth special \r\nsession.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report entitled “Framework of \r\nactions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2014” (A/69/62). The Government \r\nof Cabo Verde shares the report’s conclusion that \r\nincreasing individual human rights, capabilities and \r\ndignity across the multiple sectors of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) is \r\nthe foundation of sustainable development.\r\nCabo Verde has been putting human beings at \r\nthe centre of its endeavours to implement the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action, particularly in the areas of \r\npoverty reduction, access to sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth services, access to education, the reduction of \r\nmaternal and child mortality, family planning and the \r\nprotection of reproductive rights. Combating violence \r\nagainst women and women’s empowerment have been \r\namong the highest priorities for our Government. In \r\nits annual report, just released, UNICEF indicates that \r\n14-56244 19/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nCabo Verde is about to achieve Goal 4 of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), on child and maternal \r\nmortality. I can inform the Assembly that Cabo Verde \r\nis in fact on the brink of meeting most of the MDGs.\r\nThe education of a young population and job creation \r\ncontinue to pose great challenges for the Government \r\nof Cabo Verde. However, as a consequence of our sound \r\npolicies in that area, our reduced fertility rates and the \r\nageing of the population have created new challenges \r\nin issues related to the phenomenon of immigration, \r\nwhich is already beginning to put pressure on our social \r\nand economic structures. The expertise and support of \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in that \r\narea is of the utmost important to my country. \r\nCabo Verde is fully committed to further \r\nimplementing the ICPD Programme of Action. We are \r\naware of and committed to the outcome of our regional \r\nreview and the findings and recommendations of the \r\nICPD Beyond 2014.\r\nI will conclude by stressing that my country would \r\nlike to count on the continued and strong support of the \r\nUNFPA in order to implement the 15 recommendations \r\nin the report on its review of Cabo Verde.\r\nMr. Hassan (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to \r\ncongratulate you on your assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and \r\nwish you every success. I would also like to thank you for \r\nconvening this special and important meeting to follow \r\nup on the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nbeyond 2014. My delegation also thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the topic entitled “Framework \r\nof actions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2014” (A/69/62). We also thank \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the regional \r\ncommissions for facilitating the operational review in \r\nour States and regions.\r\nToday we would like to stress that one of the most \r\nimportant challenges we are now facing is the eradication \r\nof poverty and our efforts to to do that. Those efforts \r\nrequire coordination and cooperation at every level \r\nin dealing with the underlying causes of poverty and \r\nwith the phenomenon of climate change, with which \r\npoverty eradication is now intertwined. Food security \r\nand unemployment are the most prominent issues to be \r\ndealt with. \r\nWe emphasize the importance of enhancing \r\ninternational cooperation and partnership everywhere, \r\nas well as coordinating activities aimed at formulating \r\nenvironmental policies to achieve equitable and \r\nsustainable economic growth and to mobilize the \r\nnecessary financial resources. It is also necessary to \r\nstudy the relevant challenges, taking into consideration \r\ncountries’ varied levels of development and striving for \r\na smooth transition to a post-2015 development agenda. \r\nIn that regard, we would like to recall the 1994 ICPD, \r\nat which we adopted a Programme of Action based on \r\nhuman rights and the principles of sustainability. It \r\naimed at enabling populations to exercise their right to \r\nparticipate in development through enhancing health-\r\ncare services, better education and good governance, \r\nwithout discrimination on the basis of race, colour or \r\nreligion.\r\nThe Sudan is now going through a phase of \r\ndemographic transition, since according to the most \r\nrecent census, taken in 2008, our population has now \r\nreached 30 million and is expected to double by the year \r\n2035. That demographic reality requires us to establish \r\nnational strategies to improve our demographic records, \r\nquality of life and well-being. \r\nThe secession of South Sudan in 2011 created a \r\nnew economic, demographic and political reality in the \r\nSudan, which requires that we come up with the support \r\nneeded to update our demographic data through a new \r\ncensus and by conducting the comprehensive national \r\nsurveys and intensive studies required for sound \r\nplanning for development.\r\nWe have seen enormous changes in the issue of \r\nimmigration, owing to the continuing f low of migrants \r\nboth internally and externally. Because it borders on \r\nseven other States, the Sudan is considered a transit \r\nState, which makes the problem of human trafficking, \r\nespecially of women and children, a major challenge. It \r\nrequires concerted effort both nationally and regionally \r\nthrough cooperation among South-South countries, and \r\ninternationally through partnership among departments \r\nmanaging migration. We must change the challenges \r\ninto opportunities for development among the countries \r\ninvolved. \r\nThe Sudan has fulfilled its obligations in \r\nestablishing peace, security, stability and development. \r\nHowever, we have continued to face genuine challenges \r\nowing to economic sanctions and the burden of foreign \r\ndebt, which have adversely affected all aspects of our \r\ndevelopment and basic services.\r\n20/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nIn spite of all the restrictions facing the Sudan, \r\nit has achieved notable progress in implementing the \r\nICPD Programme of Action, especially with regard to \r\nthe empowerment of women and gender equality. My \r\nGovernment has adopted numerous policies that serve \r\nas incentives to increase the political participation \r\nof women, especially in leadership roles and at the \r\ndecision-making level. The Government of the Sudan \r\nhas continued to spare no effort to reduce the threat \r\nof poverty through social security programmes, \r\nmicrofinance services and social protection networks \r\naimed at supporting poor families, upgrading the \r\nstandard of living and generating employment for \r\nyoung men. With regard to the reduction of maternal \r\nmortality, the Government has continued to improve \r\nthe health of mothers and children through vaccination. \r\nThe Government is sparing no effort to fight AIDS, \r\nmalaria and chronic diseases, and it is also seeking to \r\nmainstream health insurance programmes and to offer \r\nfree treatment for children under 5 years of age.\r\nMy delegation calls on the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies to provide assistance, especially \r\nin conflict-affected States. The Sudan has participated \r\nin the review preparations and in all the reviews \r\nconducted at the regional level in the Arab and African \r\ncontexts by virtue of its commitment to the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action after 2014 and to the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. We endorse the outcomes of the \r\nglobal and regional reviews regarding the fact that \r\nsuch programmes have not been completed and urge \r\nthat they be completed through concerted efforts and \r\nthe building of partnerships on all levels, especially \r\nsince today the prospects for development are far better \r\nthan they were in 1994. We are in desperate need of \r\ninvestment in programmes for youth and for the creation \r\nof further opportunities for young people to participate \r\nin building peace and promoting development for a \r\nbetter future.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report (A/69/122) \r\nstresses the importance of accountability and sound \r\ngovernance to guarantee the post-2014 implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action. It emphasizes the need \r\nto consolidate effective partnerships and cooperative \r\nrelations that support national development strategies \r\nand include population dynamics. We should like to \r\nunderscore the central role of the United Nations system \r\nin supporting and enhancing the efforts of States to \r\nimplement the ICPD Programme of Action after 2014 \r\nand the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation notes that the Sudan \r\nis now on the threshold of a critical new political phase \r\nthanks to the initiative launched by President Omer \r\nHassan A. Al-Bashir on 27 January, which involves \r\nholding a comprehensive national dialogue to ensure \r\nthat all political forces in the country participate in \r\ndecision-making. The current dialogue is not about who \r\ngoverns the Sudan, but how to govern it in such a way as \r\nto achieve our desired development objectives and the \r\nnecessary stability to be able to continue implementing \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the goals of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): The delegation of \r\nBrazil takes this opportunity to welcome and express our \r\ndeep appreciation for the supporting documentation by \r\nthe Secretary-General. The Secretary-General’s reports \r\n(A/69/62 and A/69/122) reveal that Member States \r\nhave made considerable progress in implementing the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD). We have \r\nsignificantly reduced poverty and improved access to \r\nand the quality of health and education services. Since \r\nthe Cairo Conference, reproductive rights have been \r\nrealized all over the world. And the outcome documents \r\nof the regional conferences have recognized that, \r\nfrom the perspective of population and development, \r\nevidence-based comprehensive sexuality education is \r\none of the paths to progress.\r\nIn celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nCairo agenda, Brazil reiterates its full commitment and \r\nunwavering support to the United Nations initiatives \r\naimed at promoting the goals of that Programme \r\nand confirms its subsequent commitments. Brazil \r\nhas subscribed to the Montevideo Consensus on \r\nPopulation and Development, adopted by the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean region in 2013, which not \r\nonly recognizes the importance of universal access \r\nto health and reproductive rights and gender equality, \r\nbut also advances progressive commitments on sexual \r\norientation and gender identity. The Montevideo \r\nConsensus took the lead in supporting comprehensive \r\nsexuality education and recognizing the right to safe and \r\nlegal abortions, to access to emergency contraception \r\nand to recognition of unpaid work.\r\nWith a view to assessing the results of and \r\nimproving the policies implemented in this area within \r\nthe framework of the ICPD Programme of Action, in \r\n2012 Brazil reactivated its National Commission on \r\nPopulation and Development. The Commission is made \r\n14-56244 21/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nup of representatives of ministries and civil society \r\norganizations, who contribute to the elaboration of \r\nintegrated policies in such areas as the treatment of \r\nHIV/AIDS and sexual and reproductive health. Our \r\npublic policies with respect to sexual and reproductive \r\nrights are in line with the principles of the Cairo \r\nProgrammeof Action. In keeping with the concept \r\nof comprehensive care for women, Brazil is seeking \r\nto guarantee the right to free exercise of sexuality, \r\nreproductive planning and humanized prenatal, \r\ndelivery and postpartum care, with a marked reduction \r\nin maternal mortality.\r\nBrazil has covered a great deal of ground since \r\nthe Cairo Conference. The percentage of the Brazilian \r\npopulation below the extreme poverty line is today \r\njust one third of what it was when the ICPD took \r\nplace. The per capita income of Brazil’s poorest 10 per \r\ncent increased almost four times faster than that of \r\nthe richest 10 per cent, and that translated into an \r\nunprecedented decline in inequality within the country. \r\nLabour conditions have improved very substantially, \r\nand average unemployment on a yearly basis now \r\nhovers around the 5 per cent mark, one of the world’s \r\nlowest — and this notwithstanding the economic and \r\nfinancial crisis of 2008, from which major economies \r\nare still recovering. Average labour income is now \r\n60 per cent higher than it was 20 years ago. Life \r\nexpectancy is almost 10 years longer, and the infant \r\nmortality rate is only one quarter of that in 1994. Today, \r\nunder 1 per cent of Brazilian municipalities have a very \r\nlow human development index, as against 85 per cent \r\nin the early 1990s.\r\nBrazil has also made progress in adopting a legal \r\nframework that addresses the vulnerable segments of \r\nits society. In 2011, by a decision of the Supreme Court \r\nof Justice, Brazil recognized and ensured equal rights \r\nfor same-sex unions.\r\nMany challenges lie ahead. Levels of maternal \r\nmortality and unwanted adolescent pregnancy need to \r\ndecline more rapidly. Rates for youth unemployment \r\nand dropping out of school early need to be further \r\nreduced. The country has persistent gender gaps and \r\nasymmetries domestically, socially and in the labour \r\nmarket, in both the public and the private sectors, \r\nas well as large and enduring racial differentials in \r\nopportunities and outcomes. That is where Government \r\nprogrammes such as the national programme for access \r\nto technical education and employment, Bolsa Família \r\nand many others have been brought into play in order \r\nto reverse the historical negative trend resulting from \r\nyears of insufficient attention to marginalized and \r\nvulnerable groups, the needy and the less fortunate.\r\nThe world is still plagued with unacceptable \r\nlevels of inequality, aggravated by many forms of \r\ndiscrimination. Progress in realizing fundamental \r\nhuman rights - such as sexual rights, comprehensive \r\nsexuality education, the right not to be discriminated \r\nagainst on the grounds of colour, gender, age, civil \r\nstatus, gender identity and sexual orientation, respect \r\nfor diversity and the full protection of the rights of \r\nall migrants - has been slow and fragmented. We are \r\nhopeful that a global consensus of the United Nations \r\non a new vision for sustainable development based \r\non the Rio+20 outcome document, “The future we \r\nwant”, will bring the international community closer \r\nto cooperating effectively to overcome those critical \r\nhurdles.\r\nThe 17 goals and 169 targets adopted by the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals \r\nprovide an integrated platform for this new vision. They \r\nare a groundbreaking outcome that we wish to preserve \r\nas the main basis for integrating the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals into the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, to be adopted a year from now.\r\nWe value the social and human rights dimensions of \r\nthis new set of goals and targets, ranging from poverty \r\neradication and combating inequality to universal \r\naccess to sexual and reproductive health-care services \r\nunder a framework of economic growth, inclusiveness \r\nand sustainability. It is an agenda that seeks to be \r\nuniversal in nature while recognizing the common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities of developed and \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nWe now need to concentrate on ensuring that the \r\nmeans of implementation are clearly identified and \r\nthat they measure up to our high ambitions in terms \r\nof official development assistance commitments, \r\npolicy space for developing countries, and national and \r\ninternational mobilization of resources and technology. \r\nWe will have to focus on adequate and effective \r\nindicators, with assistance from the United Nations, the \r\ncompetent national entities of Member States and the \r\nrelevant civil society groups.\r\nRealizing rights entails promoting equality and \r\nequity within and among countries, securing respect \r\nfor diversity, and improving education, working \r\nconditions and opportunities for all. Development also \r\n22/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nrequires worldwide synergy and global leadership from \r\nthe United Nations. This is where we need to reaffirm \r\nunambiguously that the right to development is a \r\nfundamental, universal and inalienable human right.\r\nIf we are serious about population and development, \r\nand I believe we are, the foregoing are our main \r\nendeavours. In that spirit, I would like to reaffirm \r\nBrazil’s full commitment to the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction, to the key actions for its further implementation \r\nand to the findings and recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General.\r\nMr. Ruiz (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): Colombia \r\nthanks you, Mr. President, for allowing us to show our \r\ncommitment to the population and development agenda \r\nand its extension beyond 2014. \r\nIn 1994, we decided to implement the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action to guarantee to all persons a life \r\nlived without discrimination, in equitable conditions \r\nand free from poverty, and with full respect ensured for \r\nall rights, including sexual and reproductive rights. Our \r\ngoal was the full implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction by 2014, and today we can count innumerable \r\nprime examples of progress for all our populations. In \r\nthe case of Colombia, that agenda was fundamental for \r\nguiding public policies on the subject.\r\nColombia has made significant progress in \r\ncombating poverty. More than 2.5 million people \r\nhave emerged from poverty in the past four years. \r\nThat figure does not correlate with income alone but \r\nreflects a multidimensional perspective that takes into \r\naccount such variables as education, health and work. \r\nThe multidimensional vision of poverty has allowed us \r\nto measure the true extent of the transformation in a \r\nperson’s quality of life and its sustainability over time. \r\nFurthermore, my country has a comprehensive human \r\nrights policy, which has a differential approach and \r\ncovers children, youth and women, together with lesbian, \r\ngay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons, as well \r\nas indigenous peoples, Afro-Colombians, people with \r\ndisabilities and older persons.\r\nAmong our achievements, I must point out today \r\nthe progress made in reducing maternal and child \r\nmortality. In addition, I am pleased to note that we have \r\nmade significant headway in preventing adolescent \r\npregnancies.\r\nThe population and development agenda has \r\nallowed us to undertake concrete action to guarantee \r\nsexual and reproductive health for everyone, without \r\ndiscrimination of any kind, as universal human rights. \r\nFor that reason, in the framework of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, we have advocated the inclusion \r\nof a goal along those lines. Synergy between the \r\npopulation and development agenda and the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals is undeniable because they address \r\nmultidimensional development and are people-centred.\r\nAt this session of the General Assembly, we will \r\nbe called on to discuss the sustainable development \r\ngoals. We cannot lose sight of the fact that those goals \r\nhave the potential of transforming our States and the \r\nlives of the individuals and peoples in them. They are, \r\nundoubtedly, a set of tools with which to accomplish \r\nthe goals set in Cairo in 1994.\r\nMr. Kydyrov (Kyrgyzstan): At the outset I would \r\nlike to thank you, Mr. President, for organizing today’s \r\ndebate, which I hope will be fruitful.\r\nAlthough the world has changed significantly \r\nin the last two decades, the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD), adopted in 1994, remains \r\nrelevant. Furthermore, the strong interdependence of \r\nthe issues of development, environment and human \r\nwell-being outlined in the ICPD Programme provides \r\nthe solid foundation for sustainable development and \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nI would like to inform the General Assembly that, \r\ndespite the complex political processes and economic \r\ndifficulties in Kyrgyzstan, we have achieved good \r\nprogress in our implementation of the Programme of \r\nAction. The new Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic, \r\nadopted after the revolution of 2010, proclaims \r\nKyrgyzstan as a socially oriented State. It should be \r\nnoted that the European Commission for Democracy \r\nthrough Law, known as the “Venice Commission”, \r\ncommended the section of the Constitution that \r\naddresses human rights and freedoms.\r\nTo date, my country has ratified seven of the nine \r\nmajor United Nations international conventions on \r\nhuman rights. Furthermore, Kyrgyzstan has subscribed \r\nto more than 40 international obligations and standards \r\nin the area of human rights, within the framework of \r\nthe legal instruments of the United Nations, the main \r\nconventions of the International Labour Organization \r\nand the Helsinki Final Act.\r\nMost of the international standards on human \r\nrights and basic freedoms have been incorporated \r\ninto our national legislation. Kyrgyzstan has adopted \r\n14-56244 23/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\n25 regulatory legal instruments to protect the legitimate \r\nrights and interests of children. Laws guaranteeing \r\nequal rights and equal opportunities for men and \r\nwomen, together with social and legal protection \r\nfrom domestic violence, are the underpinnings of \r\nan equitable gender policy. To effectively regulate \r\nmigration and demographic trends, we have adopted \r\nlaws on such subjects as external migration, internal \r\nmigration, international labour migration, refugees \r\nand preventing and combating trafficking in human \r\nbeings, as well as many other legal instruments on \r\nsocial and health protection issues. Kyrgyzstan also \r\nattaches great importance to improving health care and \r\nfighting HIV/AIDS and preventing its impact on our \r\nsocioeconomic development. It is necessary to note that \r\nchild mortality has been substantially reduced in recent \r\nyears, and we have achieved some progress in the area \r\nof reproductive health.\r\nKyrgyzstan has also succeeded in implementing the \r\nProgramme of Action with regard to the empowerment \r\nof women and the improvement of their political and \r\nsocial status. The representation of women and youth at \r\ndecision-making levels has significantly increased. In \r\nrecent years, our women have held leadership positions, \r\nincluding as President, Chairperson of the Supreme \r\nCourt, ministers and heads of other governmental \r\ninstitutions. Today, nearly a third of our Parliament \r\nmembers are women.\r\nThe new challenges in economic development have \r\nled to a growth in unemployment, which is a major \r\nfactor in internal and external migration, especially on \r\nthe part of the young population. The analysis of the \r\ncountry’s demographic and labour situation shows that \r\nthe trend of growing labour migration from Kyrgyzstan \r\nto foreign countries will continue, at least for the \r\nnext five years. Although that tendency will lead to \r\na reduction in the unemployment level, it will have \r\na negative influence on demographic trends, labour \r\npower and the institution of the family.\r\nDespite the progress achieved, there is still \r\nmuch to be done. Further empowerment of women, \r\nespecially in rural areas, child protection, employment \r\nopportunities for young people and the improvement \r\nof social protection for the elderly and disabled, have \r\nbecome key objectives for the future we want. In order \r\nto reach those objectives, we have adopted a national \r\nsustainable development strategy for 2014-2017, which \r\nfocuses on improvements in the effectiveness of health \r\ncare and education, the protection of human rights and \r\nfreedoms, the role of the family, gender equality and \r\nsocial protection.\r\nFinally, I would like to reaffirm that Kyrgyzstan \r\nis strongly committed to strengthening international \r\ncooperation and effective partnership with the United \r\nNations Population Fund and other United Nations \r\nagencies. That is the only real way to facilitate a \r\nfull implementation of the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): It \r\nis with great pleasure that I take the f loor at this \r\nmeeting dedicated to reviewing the Programme of \r\nAction of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD) beyond 2014. I take this \r\nopportunity to thank the Executive Director of the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) for the \r\nattention he has given to the issue through the many \r\nevents held, the reports published and the support \r\nprovided to developing countries aimed at enabling \r\nthem to benefit from the experience that has been \r\ngained in terms of population and development policies.\r\nSince the adoption of the 1994 Cairo Programme \r\nof Action, significant progress has been made and has \r\nbeen reviewed in 1999, 2004 and 2009 and, finally, at \r\nthe comprehensive review of the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction held in April 2014 at the forty-seventh session \r\nof the Commission on Population and Development. \r\nMy country, the Kingdom of Morocco, welcomes the \r\nmany consultations and surveys carried out with the \r\nsupport of UNFPA, which have enabled us to assess the \r\nprogress made and identify the challenges that continue \r\nto affect the achievement of the objectives set out by \r\nthe Cairo Conference. Similarly, audits performed in \r\n2013 during the regional conferences, in cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations regional commissions, allowed \r\nfor an open and inclusive regional consultation on the \r\nsubject of monitoring the Programme of Action beyond \r\n2014 and the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMorocco has made  progress in many areas, including \r\nuniversal access to sexual and reproductive health \r\nservices. The rate of contraceptive use has increased \r\nsignificantly, and infant and maternal mortality have \r\ndeclined significantly over the past 20 years, from \r\n76.1 infant deaths per 1,000 in 1991 to 30.5 per 1,000 \r\nin 2011, and from 332 maternal deaths per 100,000 live \r\nbirths in 1992 to 112 deaths in 2010. The number of \r\nprenatal consultations and the proportion of assisted \r\n24/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nbirths also increased significantly, reaching 77.1 per \r\ncent and 73.6 per cent, respectively, in 2011.\r\nMoreover, in addition to its reproductive health \r\nstrategy and national family planning programme, \r\nMorocco has implemented a health strategy aimed \r\nat meeting the specific needs of young people and \r\nadolescents, particularly in terms of information, \r\neducation and clinical services for the prevention of \r\nunwanted pregnancies, on the risks related to unsafe \r\nabortions and on the prevention and treatment of \r\nsexually transmissible diseases and gender-based \r\nviolence.\r\nIn terms of strengthening democracy, Morocco \r\nhas undertaken bold reforms at both the institutional \r\nand the legislative levels. They include the revision \r\nof the Constitution; the reform of the penal, election, \r\nfamily, nationality and labour codes; and the adoption \r\nof advanced regionalization measures. Alongside those \r\nreforms, the Kingdom has established institutions \r\ntasked with enforcing the rules of good governance, \r\nprotecting rights and freedoms and strengthening \r\nparticipatory democracy.\r\nThat decisive progress towards realizing the vision \r\nof a society that ensures the effectiveness of rights \r\nand freedoms is enhanced by the Kingdom’s efforts \r\nto harmonize national law and align its policies with \r\ninternationally ratified conventions. We have also lifted \r\nour reservations to the Convention on the Elimination \r\nof All Forms of Discrimination against Women and \r\nadopted the Optional Protocol thereto, which is in line \r\nwith that progress.\r\nThe results achieved in the 20 years since the \r\nCairo Conference are encouraging but remain uneven \r\nacross regions and countries and within countries. \r\nThose difficulties are compounded by new challenges \r\nin a constantly changing environment characterized \r\nby rapid globalization and changes in types of family \r\norganization, the emerging needs of youth, the ageing \r\nof the population, rapid urbanization in developing \r\ncountries and growing disparities.\r\nIn addition, the mobilization of resources \r\ncontinues to be a concern. Of course, internal resource \r\nmobilization should be encouraged and diversified, \r\nbut without an effective contribution by the donor \r\ncommunity, it will be difficult to achieve the objectives \r\nof the Cairo Programme of Action, which remain valid \r\nbeyond 2014, as stressed in resolution 65/234, which \r\nwas adopted in 2010.\r\nThe delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco firmly \r\nsupports the ICPD review process, which reaffirms \r\nthe validity of the goals set out in the Programme of \r\nAction of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development for the period beyond 2014 and \r\nsupports their inclusion in the post-2015 development \r\nprogramme.\r\nMr. Bristol (Nigeria): At the outset, I would like \r\nto commend you, Mr. President, for your excellent \r\nleadership of the General Assembly at this session \r\nand, more importantly, for providing us with the \r\nopportunity to share our perspectives on the important \r\nissues arising from the International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) beyond 2014 for \r\nhuman development and improvement.\r\nAs this debate is coming on the heels of the \r\ntwenty-ninth special session of the General Assembly, \r\non the follow-up to the Programme of Action of \r\nthe International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) beyond 2014, which was held last \r\nmonth, Nigeria believes that a window of opportunity \r\nhas once again been provided for Member States \r\nto exchange ideas on the best practices needed to \r\ntransform the lives of the poor and the vulnerable. We \r\nare of the view that the global community must take \r\nadvantage of the opportunity to shape the two key \r\nglobal development agendas: the ICPD Programme \r\nbeyond 2014, and the post-2015 development agenda. Of \r\nparticular importance is the need to engage an effective \r\nframework for reviewing existing population trends and \r\nrelated policies to capture all emerging development \r\nissues within the context of the two agendas.\r\nNigeria also reiterates that concerted efforts must \r\nbe devoted to the assessment of the quantity and quality \r\nof investments made to improve the lives of the various \r\ncomponents of the population, especially young people, \r\nwomen and girls, as well as the condition of the aged. \r\nIn that regard, we affirm our commitment to the full \r\nimplementation of the ICPD+20 agenda. We would, \r\nhowever, like to highlight that the agenda must include \r\nthe following priority areas.\r\nQuality investments in young people’s education, \r\nhealth care, employment and inclusion are necessary \r\ningredients for reaping the democratic dividend. \r\nExtreme poverty and hunger must be eradicated. The \r\nsexual and reproductive health of adolescents, young \r\npeople and women must be improved, with a view \r\nespecially to accelerating the promotion of family \r\n14-56244 25/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\nplanning practices. The rates for avoidable maternal \r\ndeaths and those of infants and children under 5 must \r\nbe reduced to single digit figures. Practices that protect \r\nwomen, girls and children, including those in conflicts \r\nand insecure situations, against violence must be \r\nprioritized. Policies that inhibit early marriage must be \r\nsupported. Social security must be institutionalized, so \r\nas to provide support for the elderly, especially ageing \r\nwomen. \r\nWe have to properly situate population dynamics \r\nin the entire spectrum of our population and \r\ndevelopment programmes. We have to provide support \r\nto build capacity and invest more in technology, data \r\ncollection, analysis, disaggregation, dissemination, \r\ncommunication and management strategies for the \r\neffective monitoring and evaluation of policies and \r\nprogrammes. We must prioritize programmes of action \r\nthat promote the security of life and property and \r\nlasting internal stability. Finally, we must promote \r\ngood governance, transparency and accountability.\r\nNigeria urges cooperation on the part of all \r\nstakeholders through unconditional partnerships and \r\nglobal leadership from the United Nations as the next \r\nphase unfolds.\r\nMr. Grima (Malta): Malta welcomes the holding \r\nof this meeting supplementing the special session \r\ncelebrating the twentieth anniversary of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nand its Programme of Action. \r\nThe International Conference, held in Cairo in \r\n1994, presented a paradigm shift when the international \r\ncommunity agreed that population was not just about \r\npeople, but about making people count. Through the \r\nProgramme of Action, States made a pledge to improve \r\nthe lives of individuals by moving away from the \r\nfocus on numbers and instead putting human rights at \r\nthe heart of population and development issues. That \r\napproach ensured that realizing and protecting human \r\nrights would in turn contribute to the improvement of \r\nhuman lives and advance everyone’s well-being.\r\nThe 1994 Conference Declaration and its \r\nProgramme of Action is a point of reference to other \r\nprocesses and other key documents, such as the Beijing \r\nPlatform for Action. As a matter of fact, the principles \r\nhighlighted in Cairo were reconfirmed six years \r\nlater when world leaders endorsed the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) and the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which have been a central \r\npart of the United Nations work over the past 14 years. \r\nWith less than a year left, it is important that Member \r\nStates continue their endeavours to fulfil the MDGs. \r\nThe ensuing process will build upon their successes \r\nand seek to address the gaps. The post-2015 framework \r\nshould accomplish the unfinished business of the \r\nMDGs.\r\nEconomic and social development continue to be \r\nan integral part of the Cairo legacy - they are its pillars \r\n- and, together with sustainable development, remain \r\na dominant factor in today’s development agenda. \r\nHowever, progress on the ICPD beyond 2014 agenda has \r\nto be universal and should address every part of society, \r\nthereby ensuring an all-inclusive society that leaves no \r\none behind. It should also support other sectors, such as \r\nagriculture, energy, transport, environment, water and \r\nhealth.\r\nFurthermore, any development agenda that aims at \r\nindividual and collective well-being and sustainability \r\nhas to guarantee dignity and human rights to all \r\nindividuals. Malta believes that development and \r\nhuman rights are intrinsically interrelated, and, to that \r\nend, it considers a move towards a human rights-based \r\napproach to development cooperation as a positive \r\ndevelopment. Such an approach helps respect, protect \r\nand fulfil human rights universally.\r\nThe progress achieved in improving the livelihood \r\nof people since the adoption of the Programme of \r\nAction can easily be seen. Tangible results include the \r\nadvancement of the status of women. Most societies \r\nnow acknowledge and are working towards improving \r\nwomen’s full participation in all sectors of society. For \r\nexample, the ICPD helped us promote the importance \r\nof economically independent women and their role in \r\ndecision-making, particularly political participation, \r\nas a means of enabling development and healthier \r\nsocieties.\r\nThanks to the ICPD, we have also seen an increase \r\nin the rate of education, which is also a means of \r\npromoting development and gender equality and of \r\nchanging gender stereotypes and discriminatory \r\nattitudes. In the past 20 years, we have seen a decrease \r\nin extreme poverty. There have also been significant \r\nreductions in maternal deaths and improvements in \r\nskilled birth attendance. Having said that, we are still \r\nnot there and more needs to be done.\r\nThe world is passing through difficult and \r\nchallenging times. The prevalence of poverty, climate \r\n26/27 14-56244\r\nA/69/PV.22 09/10/2014\r\nchange, diseases like malaria and HIV/AIDS, the Ebola \r\npandemic, terrorism, natural diseases, the trafficking \r\nof persons, particularly women and children, and illegal \r\ntrafficking in arms and drugs are all proliferating \r\nthe risks that our generation is facing and even at \r\ntimes threaten the very existence of our populations. \r\nSuch crises and threats are marginalizing the Cairo \r\nProgramme of Action and the MDGs, putting them \r\nbeyond our reach unless a renewed effort is made by \r\nall to correct and turn the tide of those predicaments \r\nimpeding the protection of our present and future \r\ngenerations.\r\nWe regret that the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nhas of late been associated with and linked solely to \r\nreproductive rights. Although chapters VII and VIII \r\nrepresent important aspects of the ICPD, one must also \r\nappreciate and recognize the other chapters and the \r\nProgramme of Action in its entirety. As it did in Cairo \r\nmany years ago, Malta would like to once again reaffirm \r\nits position on reproductive rights and its long-standing \r\nposition that no recommendation or commitment can in \r\nany way create an obligation on any party to consider \r\nabortion as a legitimate form of reproductive health \r\nrights, services or commodities. Malta continues to \r\nhold the view that any discussion of rights and services \r\nrelating to reproductive health cannot take place outside \r\nthe framework of one of the most fundamental human \r\nrights - the right to life.\r\nMalta strongly believes that the right to life extends \r\nto the unborn child from the moment of conception, and \r\nthat therefore the use of abortion as a means of resolving \r\nhealth or social problems is a denial of that right. It is \r\nwithin such a framework of human rights - the right \r\nto life - that Malta has for the past 20 years held the \r\nCairo Declaration and the Programme of Action in high \r\nesteem. Malta will remain committed to implement the \r\nICPD values and objectives in that spirit. The ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action is a benchmark document that \r\nhas served a guide for improving the lives and dignity \r\nof all people. The chapters are based on the notion that \r\nwe all have to strive to improve human lives through the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Since 1994, \r\na constant debate has centred on how to implement that \r\nbelief.\r\nAs we move forward and the target date of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals approaches, \r\nthe international community needs to renew its \r\ncommitments and efforts to achieve the ICPD goals \r\nand commitments. It must also build on the ICPD \r\nand work hard to reach a consensus on a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda that responds to the opportunities \r\nand challenges of today’s world.\r\nWe believe that the work on the framework of \r\nactions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment beyond 2014 should be grounded in a \r\ncritical evaluation of the success of the ICPD, the \r\nMDGs and subsequent relevant commitments. In \r\nthe process, both successful areas and those needing \r\nimprovement should be identified and guide our \r\nresponse to the current development challenges in a \r\npost-2015 framework.\r\nMr. Giorgio (Eritrea): I thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor organizing this important meeting.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to express Eritrea’s commitment \r\nto the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD). \r\nThe assessment of the status of the implementation \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action undertaken at the \r\nforty-seventh session of the Commission on Population \r\nand Development, last April, was the result of intense \r\nand lengthy intergovernmental negotiations. It covered \r\nseveral important matters that are essential to our \r\ncore values with regard to moving forward the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action beyond 2014. In that regard, it \r\nis important that the development strategy should be \r\ncountry-led and take the specific conditions, needs and \r\npriorities of every State into account.\r\nAs many countries respond to the challenges of \r\ndemographic changes, poverty, social inequalities, \r\ninternational migration, rapid urbanization and climate \r\nchange, it is vital to integrate population dynamics \r\ninto development planning at the national, regional \r\nand international levels. With regard to the linkages \r\nbetween the ICPD Programme of Action beyond 2014 \r\nand the post-2015 development agenda and other \r\nintergovernmentally agreed goals, it essential that \r\nthe overarching goal should be to eradicate extreme \r\npoverty in all its manifestations. \r\nTo meet the commitments that we make and have \r\nmade in various forums, cooperation, coordination \r\nand participation should be enhanced in an inclusive \r\nmanner among all stakeholders. In the delivery of basic \r\nservices, Eritrea has been emphasizing the participation \r\nof communities at the grass-roots level to promote \r\nself-reliance and reduce dependency. By mobilizing \r\nand motivating communities to be involved in the \r\n14-56244 27/27\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.22\r\ndesign, development and utilization of development \r\nprogrammes, Eritrea has succeeded in meeting the \r\nhealth-related Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and \r\n6. That significant achievement was announced in a \r\nside event, jointly organized with the United Nations \r\ncountry team, during the general debate at the current \r\nsession.\r\nHowever, in order to sustain its success, Eritrea \r\nrecognized that more needs to be done, which \r\nincludes consolidating and building on those gains, \r\nfurther empowering women and girls, improving \r\naccess to strengthened reproductive and health-care \r\nservices, intensifying efforts to end child marriages \r\nand female genital mutilation, continuing to build \r\nhuman capabilities, especially among the youth, \r\nand strengthening data collection analysis and \r\ndissemination.\r\nSince the adoption of the ICPD in 1994, migration \r\nhas become a growing feature of our globalizing world, \r\nbringing challenges and opportunities to the countries \r\nof origin, transit and destination. In that regard, the \r\nnexus between migration and development must be \r\ncomprehensively addressed.\r\nLet me conclude by thanking the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund and its leadership for its cooperation \r\nin organizing a series of consultations and briefings, \r\nespecially at the regional level, which allowed us to \r\nbenefit from an open and frank discussions on a range \r\nof issues leading to the adoption of an African core \r\nposition.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
