The \r\nthrust of the Programme is the well-being of individuals, \r\nunderscored by the premises of protecting human rights, \r\ninvesting in health and education, advancing gender \r\nequality and empowering women. Twenty years on, the \r\ngoals and objectives of the Programme remain valid. \r\nWe have to take it upon ourselves to respond to the new \r\nchallenges relevant to population and development, \r\ngiven the changing development environment.\r\nMalaysia shares the view that the current state \r\nof the world’s population is one of unprecedented \r\ndiversity and change, reflected in new patterns of \r\nfertility, mortality, migration, urbanization and aging. \r\nThe continuation and consequences of those population \r\ntrends will present both opportunities and challenges \r\nfor the formulation and implementation of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nSince the adoption of the Programme, the \r\nGovernment of Malaysia, through the Ministry of \r\nWomen, Family and Community Development, has \r\ndeveloped and implemented its national plan of action. \r\nWe are pleased to report that Malaysia has achieved \r\nmost of the objectives and goals of the Programme. \r\nFurthermore, new policies and programmes are \r\ncurrently being implemented to respond to the changing \r\nsocioeconomic conditions and emerging challenges for \r\nMalaysia’s becoming a high-income developed nation \r\nby 2020.\r\nKey enabling factors – such as our political stability, \r\na harmonious social environment, unity and strength in \r\ndiversity, an educated and trained workforce, abundant \r\nnatural resources and effective partnerships with \r\nstakeholders and nongovernmental organizations – have \r\ncontributed to our success in achieving the Programme \r\nand other development goals. That has also resulted in \r\nsignificant poverty reduction, more balanced economic \r\nparticipation and wider coverage of essential services, \r\nsuch as health care and education nationwide.\r\nPoverty eradication programmes have been highly \r\neffective in reducing the prevalence of poverty from \r\n8.7 per cent in 1994 to 1.7 per cent in 2012. During the \r\nsame period, the rate of extreme poverty decreased \r\nfrom 2 per cent to 0.2 per cent. The reduction in the rate \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.23\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n23rd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 9 October 2014 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/13 14-56474\r\nA/69/PV.23 09/10/2014\r\nwas due to inclusive poverty eradication initiatives, \r\nwhich were aimed at improving immediate welfare \r\nas well as providing income-earning opportunities to \r\nensure sustainability.\r\nThe Government of Malaysia has given special \r\nattention to education for women. That is evident in \r\nthe enrolment of women for first degrees in public \r\nuniversities, which has been consistently about 62 per \r\ncent of students for the period from 2009 to 2012. As \r\nfor the current 2013-2014 academic year, 68.02 per cent \r\nof 41,573 new students in public universities are female. \r\nOn women’s participation rate in the workforce, the \r\nGovernment has set a target to increase the participation \r\nof women to 55 per cent by the year 2015. As a result of \r\nthe programmes we have implemented, Malaysia is set \r\nto achieve the target, as the participation rate of women \r\nin the work force has increased from 46.8 per cent in \r\n2010 to 52.4 per cent in 2013.\r\nMore than five years ago, the Government \r\nannounced its intention to increase the number of \r\nwomen in decision-making positions in the public \r\nsector by at least 30 per cent. Now we are pleased to \r\nnote that, following our proactive implementation of \r\nthat policy, the percentage of decision-making positions \r\nin the public sector held by women has increased from \r\n18.8 per cent in 2004 to 33.7 per cent in 2013. The \r\nsame target was set in 2011 for the corporate sector. \r\nThough there is still room for improvement, there are \r\nencouraging signs of change. For a start, women’s \r\nrepresentation in the boards of directors of Government \r\ninvestment companies has increased from 9 per cent in \r\nDecember 2012 to 15.34 per cent in January 2014.\r\nIn Malaysia, the number of reported HIV cases \r\nhas declined steadily. However, while the epidemic \r\nwas initially dominated by transmission through drug \r\nusers, there has been a rise in HIV cases attributed to \r\nheterosexual intercourse - a phenomenon prevalent \r\namong younger cohorts. In response, the Government \r\nhas formulated a comprehensive National Strategic Plan \r\non HIV and AIDS 2011-2015. The National Strategic \r\nPlan incorporates a multisectoral strategy that takes \r\ninto account young people’s vulnerability and provides \r\nfree first-line treatment for all patients at Government \r\nhospitals and clinics and sexual and reproductive health \r\neducation and services. It also encourages HIV testing \r\nthrough voluntary testing and counselling.\r\nWith regard to reproductive cancers, Malaysia \r\nwas one of the first countries in Asia to introduce a \r\nnational human papillomavirus vaccination programme \r\nto prevent cervical cancer. Since its inception in 2010, \r\na total of $3.2 million has been allocated to implement \r\nthe vaccination programme for school girls. To \r\ndate, 672,970 school girls have benefitted from the \r\nprogramme.\r\nDespite having achieved almost all ICPD objectives, \r\nwe are constantly assessing the changing socioeconomic \r\nconditions, such as the decline in fertility and population \r\nageing. Malaysia’s overall fertility rate declined from \r\n2.9 in 2000 to 2.2 in 2006 and to 2.1 in 2012. The \r\ndecline in the fertility rate will have profound effects \r\non the size and composition of the nation’s population. \r\nAmong its other effects, it will result in a significant \r\nage structural shift that may directly affect the future \r\nlabour force. That being said, Malaysia recognizes the \r\nimportance and the necessity of fostering a society of \r\nall ages. As Malaysia is expected to attain the ageing-\r\nnation status by 2030, the Government has formulated, \r\napproved and implemented a national policy and plan of \r\naction for older persons. The policy and plan of action \r\nconsiders both health and socioeconomic aspects with \r\nregard to older persons.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to reiterate the commitment \r\nannounced by the Minister for Women, Family and \r\nCommunity Development of Malaysia at the twenty-\r\nninth special session of the General Assembly, on the \r\nfollow-up to the Programme of Action of the ICPD. As \r\nwe respond to the new challenges relating to population \r\nand development, Malaysia will continue to deliberate \r\non and implement the goals of the Programme.\r\nMr. Cabactulan (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nis very pleased to be able to take part in this meeting \r\non the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) and to participate in the collective \r\nassessment of the status of implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action, adopted 20 years ago. Our \r\nparticipation today reflects the Philippines renewed \r\ncommitment towards the realization of the ICPD \r\npromise.\r\nThe Philippines wishes to share the following \r\nseveral points concerning the population and \r\ndevelopment situation in my country.\r\nWith regard to dignity and human rights, for the \r\nPhilippines, reducing and eliminating poverty remains \r\nthe core policy and programme framework of President \r\nBenigno Aquino’s Administration in its pursuit of \r\ninclusive growth. Recognizing that social and economic \r\n14-56474 3/13\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.23\r\ninequalities converge among the poor, the country is \r\nworking very hard to using the fruits of economic gain \r\nto generate employment and sustainable livelihood and \r\nto provide basic services to around 4.2 million poor \r\nfamilies.\r\nThe Philippines remains among the front-line \r\nStates in championing the empowerment of women and \r\nensuring gender equality. The economic and political \r\nstatus of Filipino women was lauded at the 2013 World \r\nEconomic Forum as among the 10 highest in the \r\nworld. Our national policy on gender and development \r\nallocates at least 5 per cent of the total budgets of \r\nall Government agencies for the implementation of \r\ngender-and-development-responsive interventions. \r\nThe country likewise supports initiatives to eliminate \r\ndiscrimination against the most marginalized groups of \r\nwomen and girls, including those experiencing multiple \r\nand intersecting forms of discrimination based on \r\nage, economic status, language, ethnicity, disability, \r\nsexual orientation and gender identity and other social \r\ncategories.\r\nThe Philippines remains a champion in ensuring \r\nuniversal access to quality sexual and reproductive health \r\nservices and upholding the sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth and rights of all couples and individuals. The \r\nconstitutionality of our Responsible Parenthood and \r\nReproductive Health Act of 2012 has been affirmed \r\nby our Supreme Court. And within the Universal \r\nHealth Care framework, institutional capacities among \r\nGovernment and civil society organizations are being \r\nmobilized and enhanced to improve access to a wide \r\nrange of family-planning information and services \r\nof the highest quality. The Philippines is likewise \r\nsupportive of all initiatives to protect and uphold the \r\nrights of adolescents and youth to accurate information, \r\ncomprehensive sexual education, and health services \r\nfor their well-being and life-long health.\r\nRegarding population movement and urban \r\nmanagement, the Philippines has put in place \r\nappropriate policies to support people’s right to move \r\ninternally. Our policies provide equal opportunities and \r\naccess to social protection, basic services, employment \r\nand the use of natural resources. We are also working to \r\nmeet the need for housing and support infrastructures \r\nand to establish an effective database on the needs of \r\nmigrants and local residents.\r\nOur Government puts a premium on promoting \r\nand protecting the rights and well-being of our \r\n10 million overseas Filipinos, who in 2013 contributed \r\n$22.8 billion to our economy by way of remittances. It \r\nis often misunderstood that it is part of our policy to \r\nexport Filipinos. That is not our policy. Our policy is to \r\nprotect every Filipino, wherever he may be.\r\nOn population management, recognizing people as \r\nthe most vital resource of the nation, the Philippines \r\nis making a rational and conscious effort to integrate \r\npopulation dynamics in all development initiatives, \r\nparticularly in climate change adaptation, disaster-\r\nrisk reduction and the formulation of management \r\nstrategies.\r\nIn the 20 years of implementing our ICPD \r\ncommitment, we do recognize that there remain \r\nsignificant challenges to address. We give special \r\nattention to the challenge of promoting sexual and \r\nreproductive health and rights in the country.\r\nWe recommend that the issues and recommendations \r\nof the ICPD Beyond 2014 Global Review Report and those \r\nset out in this statement be included in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. We also express our full support \r\nfor the ICPD Beyond 2014 monitoring framework as \r\na basis for national and global reporting on progress \r\nthat can enhance the review and appraisal of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its commission bodies, including \r\nthe Commission on Population and Development.\r\nFinally, we commend and support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the index report (see A/69/122), the \r\nconclusions and recommendations of which must be \r\ncarried forward to post-2015 discussions.\r\nMr. Holtz (United Kingdom): It is a pleasure to \r\nbe here today to reiterate the United Kingdom’s full \r\nsupport for the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development (ICPD) \r\nand its subsequent reviews.\r\nIn 1994 the Cairo Conference produced an agreement \r\nthat was a major landmark in recognizing the right of \r\nindividuals to have control over their lives and that \r\nplaced people at the centre of sustainable development. \r\nThe United Kingdom is proud to have been a staunch \r\nsupporter of the ICPD’s goals and principles over the \r\npast 20 years, particularly recognizing the fundamental \r\nimportance of gender equality and human rights, \r\nincluding universal access to sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth and rights, as foundations for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\n4/13 14-56474\r\nA/69/PV.23 09/10/2014\r\nThis ICPD anniversary year and review process \r\nallows us to reflect on the important achievements \r\nmade since 1994 in that regard, achievements that \r\nhave enabled many millions of women and men to be \r\nempowered to make important personal decisions about \r\ntheir lives, including their sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth, without discrimination, coercion or violence.\r\nHowever, the process has also highlighted how far \r\nwe still have to go before we fully achieve the vision \r\nof the ICPD Programme of Action. Many millions of \r\nwomen and girls around the world are still unable to \r\ndecide whether or not to have children and how many \r\nthey have, and they are denied the ability to experience \r\nsafe, healthy pregnancy and childbirth. Too many are \r\ndenied the comprehensive sexuality education needed \r\nto make informed decisions about their bodies and \r\ntheir lives. Undermining the ability of women and \r\ngirls to make those decisions diminishes not only an \r\nindividual’s full potential but also that of families in all \r\ntheir forms, communities and societies as a whole.\r\nWe know – and evidence from this review also \r\nunderlines – that we cannot achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment if discrimination and marginalization \r\nprevail and opportunities are denied to members \r\nof our society on the basis of their gender, sexual \r\norientation, race, age, disability or on any other basis. \r\nNon-discrimination and the right of individuals to \r\nlead a life free from violence should not be a distant \r\naspiration but a reality in the year 2014.\r\nTwo critical barriers to women and girls’ \r\nempowerment, recognized as such in the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action, are female genital mutilation \r\nand child, early and forced marriage. In July, the United \r\nKingdom was extremely proud to co-host the Girl \r\nSummit 2014 with UNICEF, to support and amplify \r\nefforts across the world to tackle the acts of violence \r\nagainst women and girls and to advance efforts to \r\nchallenge social norms, customs and traditions that \r\nare contrary to the enjoyment of human rights for \r\nindividuals at all ages. In our view, culture and tradition \r\nshould never be invoked by Member States as a reason \r\nto deny their responsibility to promote and protect the \r\nhuman rights of their citizens.\r\nLooking forward, we must similarly consider \r\nhow we, as an international community, can continue \r\nto work together to achieve the objectives of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action. We should remember, as \r\nMember States continue to elaborate the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda beyond 2015, that we already have \r\nan important development agenda, crafted in 1994, and \r\nthat 20 years later it has yet to be fully implemented \r\nin any region of the world. It is a universal agenda to \r\nwhich we must all recommit ourselves.\r\nThe ICPD Beyond 2014 Global Review Report and \r\nthe Secretary-General’s index report (see A/69/122), \r\npresented during this important review year, are \r\nessential contributions to inform and guide our \r\ndiscussions on priorities beyond 2015. We would like \r\nto thank the United Nations Population Fund, the \r\nPopulation Division of the Secretariat’s Department \r\nof Economic and Social Affairs and the Office of \r\nthe Secretary-General for their extensive work in \r\ncompleting those reports, and indeed throughout the \r\nyear.\r\nThe regional outcomes of the review process, \r\nin our view, constitute a forward-looking agenda \r\nthat, if embraced fully, can enable Member States to \r\nrespond to the needs and aspirations of their people, \r\nincluding the enjoyment of their human rights and the \r\nimprovement of their well-being and resilience, and to \r\nachieve true and lasting sustainable development. We \r\ncall on the United Nations system to use the findings \r\nand recommendations of the review process as key \r\nreferences to strengthen the United Nations support to \r\nMember States at all levels in our collective push to craft \r\na post-2015 development agenda that is transformative \r\nto people’s lives and that leaves no one behind.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating the commitment of \r\nthe United Kingdom to realizing the vision and promise \r\nof Cairo for all and our intention to continue to support \r\nthe ICPD beyond 2014.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar) (spoke \r\nin French): It is an honour for me to represent the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar at this historic meeting \r\ndevoted to the follow-up of the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD).\r\nThe five years of political crisis experienced by \r\nMadagascar has left the Malagasy people drained. \r\nExtreme poverty particularly affects women and young \r\npeople in rural areas. The failure to integrate the concept \r\nof population into all development plans explains the \r\nsituation, and has made a large majority of the Malgasy \r\npopulation vulnerable. In the implementation of the \r\nnew general State policy, the Malgasy Government \r\nwill spare no effort to conduct a general census of the \r\n14-56474 5/13\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.23\r\npopulation and to integrate the population dimension \r\ninto its future national development plan.\r\nMadagascar is working to reanimate its institutional \r\nframework by using multidisciplinary studies dealing \r\nwith the characteristics of poverty. Although immense \r\nchallenges remain, the new Malagasy leaders and the \r\npeople are showing their determination to redouble \r\nefforts by giving priority to the development of social \r\nsectors in the educational system and in professional \r\ntraining, health and nutrition, access to potable water, \r\nsocial protection, job creation and the preservation of \r\nthe environment.\r\nThe country has already made significant \r\nachievements. Among them are the development of a \r\nlegal framework to respond to the needs of the elderly \r\nand updated development policies in the health sector \r\nand for youth, as well as the use of data from surveys \r\nand anthropological studies of households, which allow \r\nmore in-depth studies on poverty, nutritional status, the \r\nhealth situation of mothers and children, and women’s \r\nempowerment.\r\nDespite the difficulties, Madagascar has always \r\nadhered to the Programme of Action of the International \r\nConference on Population and Development, held in \r\nCairo in 1994, and various meetings following that \r\nProgramme, most recently the forty-seventh session of \r\nthe Commission on Population and Development, held \r\nthis April in New York.\r\nThe development of the country is on the right \r\npath. The Government’s comprehensive policy, which \r\nhas defined the vision of “Madagascar: a Modern and \r\nProsperous State,” sets out challenges and strategic \r\ndirections regarding access to basic social services, \r\nincluding priority to maternal and child health and \r\nfree primary education in public establishments. The \r\nnational development plan being developed will put \r\nthe individual in harmony with his environment and \r\nat the centre of concerns to ensure the coherence and \r\nsustainability of actions. The plan will also incorporate \r\nthe main dimensions of development: population, \r\ngender, climate change and sustainable development.\r\nMadagascar is facing huge challenges, but those \r\nchallenges can be met. They include establishing an \r\neffective and harmonized social protection system, \r\nstrengthening the vocational, social and economic \r\nreintegration of the population by reducing the informal \r\nsector, and improving the governance of public affairs.\r\nOn this occasion, I extend my profound thanks \r\nto all our partners who contributed to alleviating the \r\nsuffering of the Malagasy people during the crisis. \r\nToday, the Malagasy people have decided to move \r\ntowards inclusive and sustainable development. Ready \r\nand determined, they intend to overcome all obstacles. \r\nWith that momentum, the Malagasy people count on \r\nthe support and understanding of States represented her \r\nso that their aspirations to concrete and tangible results \r\ncan be achieved.\r\nMr. Tuy (Cambodia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate the Secretary-General for the \r\nsuccessful convening of the twenty-ninth special \r\nsession on the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) beyond 2014 in order to assess the \r\nstatus of the implementation of the Programme of Action \r\nand to renew political support for the actions required \r\nfor the full achievement of its goals and objectives. \r\nWe also welcome the reports of the Secretary-General \r\n(A/69/62 and A/69/122). It is an honour for me to share \r\nthe views of the Royal Government of Cambodia on the \r\nprogress, challenges and comments on this item.\r\nCambodia has made considerable progress since \r\naffirming its commitment to the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction, especially in the areas of maternal mortality \r\nreduction, fertility decline, gender equality and \r\ncontainment of the spread of HIV. Availing ourselves \r\nof this opportunity, we wish to confirm our resolve \r\nand will redouble our efforts to improve the lives of \r\nour people with equity and dignity in coming years \r\nand to ensure sustained economic growth and inclusive \r\nsustainable development.\r\nWe wish to thank the United Nations system, which \r\nthrough the leadership of the United Nations Population \r\nFund worked closely with the Royal Government of \r\nCambodia on a review process through a global survey \r\nand a series of consultations and reviews in the Asia and \r\nPacific region. It also supported national consultations, \r\nincluding with civil society, to produce the framework \r\nof actions for the follow-up to the Programme of Action \r\nof the ICPD beyond 2014.\r\nWe endorse the operational review of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action, which \r\nwas based on the use of data of the highest quality \r\nand analysis of the data. We also welcome the \r\nfact that the country-specific report of the Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia on the status of and progress \r\n6/13 14-56474\r\nA/69/PV.23 09/10/2014\r\nin the implementation of the Programme of Action is \r\nrecognized as being consistent with resolution 65/234, \r\non follow-up to the ICPD beyond 2014.\r\nIn our country report, we have shown that \r\nCambodia has made extensive progress in adopting \r\nand implementing national development policies and \r\nkey sectoral strategies to achieve better development \r\nresults, focusing on the following aspects. We have \r\nbeen strengthening human capital, guided by human \r\nrights standards and principles, and strengthening \r\nefforts to improve gender equality, equity and women’s \r\nempowerment. We are addressing the issues of \r\nadolescent sexual reproductive health and rights. We \r\nare forging new partnerships with civil society and the \r\nprivate sector, and we are promoting the integration \r\nof population dynamics and population trends into \r\ndevelopment planning and policy-making.\r\nAfter substantial declines in fertility and \r\nmortality, Cambodia is experiencing a phase of rapid \r\ndemographic transition. The labour force is expanding \r\nwith the entry of a large number of working-age youth. \r\nBacked up by appropriate policies in all sectors. that \r\nhas a great potential to provide the country with a \r\nlarge demographic dividend through further economic \r\ndevelopment.\r\nRecognizing the influence of population dynamics, \r\nreproductive health and gender on poverty, the Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia will further strive to \r\nimprove the standard of living of its people. It will \r\ncontinue to reinforce the integration of the population \r\nand development agenda in a broad-based process of \r\ninclusive development through the implementation of \r\nthe new five-year national strategic development plan. \r\nThe plan is formulated to respond to new challenges \r\npertaining to population and development and the \r\nchanging development environment.\r\nDespite the progress made towards achieving the \r\ngoals and objectives of the Programme of Action and \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, noticeable gaps \r\nstill exist in the implementation of different areas of \r\nthe Programme of Action. While recognizing the \r\nimportance of protecting the present achievements of \r\nthe ICPD, we also need to respond to new challenges \r\nrelevant to population and development and to the \r\nchanging development environment. We therefore \r\nreaffirm our commitment at the highest political level \r\nto achieving the goals and the objectives of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action.\r\nA stronger partnership is needed to achieve those \r\nobjectives. That is absolutely vital. We call upon \r\nMember States to recognize that implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action requires mobilization of adequate \r\nresources at the national and international levels. \r\nCountries need new, additional resources from all \r\navailable funding mechanisms, including multilateral, \r\nbilateral and private sources. That is absolutely \r\nessential for the human resources development that \r\nis indispensable for the full implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action. It includes training, the exchange \r\nof experiences and expertise, knowledge transfer and \r\ntechnical assistance for capacity development. Capacity \r\ndevelopment entails strengthening institutional \r\ncapacity, including planning, management and \r\nmonitoring capacities.\r\nTo sustain the momentum and gains made in \r\n20 years of implementing the ICPD Programme of \r\nAction, the recommendations derived from the ICPD \r\nBeyond 2014 review should continue to be prominently \r\nfeatured in the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme’s Dialogues on Implementation of the Post-\r\n2015 Development Agenda, and in whatever frameworks \r\nand instruments that may shape the new international \r\ndevelopment agenda. The Royal Government of \r\nCambodia calls on Member States and civil society to \r\nspare no efforts in advocating for stronger and bolder \r\npolitical commitments to ensure that that is the case.\r\nTo support developing countries in their efforts \r\nto further implement the Programme of Action, it is \r\nhighly critical that further strengthening of national \r\ncapacity be given top priority in such a way that national \r\nGovernments can genuinely assume ownership in its \r\nimplementation. To enable developing countries to \r\nfully implement the Programme of Action beyond 2014, \r\nmobilization of resources from all possible sources and \r\nthe effective use of financing are absolutely essential.\r\nLast but not least, the Royal Government of \r\nCambodia supports continuous and more effective \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Programme of Action \r\nin the coming years. We welcome the outcome of the \r\nAssembly’s twenty-ninth special session, on follow-up \r\nto the Programme of Action beyond 2014 and the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. We encourage all Member \r\nStates not only to recognize the overall progress made \r\nso far in the Programme of Action, but also to endorse \r\nthe need for its further implementation for the bright \r\nfuture of the next generations.\r\n14-56474 7/13\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.23\r\nMr. Chinyonga (Zambia): Zambia recalls with \r\nsatisfaction the outcome of the twenty-ninth special \r\nsession of the General Assembly, on the follow-up \r\nof the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) beyond 2014, including the \r\ncommitments made by world leaders and the Assembly’s \r\ndecision to take note of the session’s deliberations on \r\nthe findings and recommendations of the ICPD Beyond \r\n2014 Global Review Report. We are pleased to have \r\ncontributed to the global survey for the ICPD Beyond \r\n2014 review, which highlighted the progress made and \r\nthe challenges that still daunt the implementation of the \r\nICPD Programme of Action.\r\nWe reiterate our support for the views expressed \r\nin the context of the Africa regional review of the \r\nimplementation of the ICPD Beyond 2014, where we \r\njoined in the adoption of the regional plan of action \r\nfor implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action. \r\nWe also reiterate the importance of harnessing Africa’s \r\ndemographic dividends, given its youthful population. \r\nZambia wishes to stress that the ICPD Beyond 2014 \r\nreview has significant linkages to and implications \r\nfor the review of progress made in the implementation \r\nof the Beijing Declaration and the Beijing Platform \r\nfor Action and for the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nWe call for strengthening those outcomes through the \r\nintegration of the findings and recommendations of the \r\nreview.\r\nAs we highlighted during the special session, \r\nZambia has a young population. The Government of \r\nZambia, with support from various stakeholders, has \r\ntherefore prioritized investments in the development \r\nneeds of young people. Those include investments in \r\nhigher education, where the Government of Zambia is \r\nmaking investments in the infrastructure of secondary \r\nand tertiary education in order to meet the higher \r\neducation needs of its youthful population. \r\nSecondly, the Government has integrated \r\ncomprehensive sexuality education into the school \r\ncurriculum in order ensure that people have access \r\nto age-appropriate information that will enable them \r\nmake informed life choices and decisions.\r\nThe third priority is harnessing demographic \r\ndividends. The Government of Zambia is spearheading \r\na national demographic-dividend study that will inform \r\nthe attainment of economic gains resulting from bold \r\nand strategic investments in health, education and job \r\ncreation. \r\nThe fourth priority is youth-friendly services. \r\nThe country is continuing to invest in the needs of \r\nyoung people for sexual and reproductive health and \r\nreproductive rights through the provision of youth-\r\nfriendly information and services.\r\nFifthly, to end child, early and forced marriages, the \r\nGovernment is coordinating a multisectoral initiative \r\nto end child marriages, which remain prevalent, and is \r\naddressing sociocultural issues that drive the problem.A \r\nmarriage bill is currently undergoing consultations. The \r\nbill addresses, among other things, formalizing the age \r\nof marriage at 18 under both customary and statutory \r\nlaw, and the consent of the two parties. All marriages, \r\nwhether customary, civil and religious, will now be \r\nrequired to be registered upon meeting the stipulated \r\ncriteria.\r\nSixthly, our national youth policy has been reviewed \r\nto incorporate new and emerging issues relating to \r\nyoung people.\r\nThe Government of Zambia has stressed that \r\nmeaningful development cannot take place without \r\naddressing fundamental gender issues, particularly \r\nthose of women’s empowerment, that continue to \r\nconstrain development. Addressing gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment is therefore central to Zambia’s \r\ndevelopment agenda. Its revised national gender policy \r\nremains the principal tool for Government to advance \r\nthe status of women. Gender inequality is exacerbated \r\nby sociocultural norms that prevent women from having \r\nequal access to education, health and labour market \r\nopportunities. Although the country has achieved \r\ngender parity in education, more remains to be done \r\nto ensure equal access in other areas of development, \r\nincluding higher education. In order to attain those \r\nobjectives, legal and policy frameworks have been put \r\nin place.\r\nZambia recognizes that sexual and reproductive \r\nhealth and reproductive rights are essential to \r\nallowing all people to achieve dignity and contribute \r\nto sustainable development through the realization \r\nof individual potential. The achievement of sexual \r\nand reproductive health and rights depends on \r\nstrengthening health systems by expanding their \r\nreach and comprehensiveness. The Government \r\nremains committed to increase the national budgetary \r\nexpenditure on health with a focus on women and \r\nchildren and to increase access to family planning \r\n8/13 14-56474\r\nA/69/PV.23 09/10/2014\r\nservices. Zambia is making the following noteworthy \r\ninvestments in that regard.\r\nFirst, Zambia is implementing commitments made \r\nat the London Summit on Family Planning in 2012, \r\nwhich include doubling the budgetary allocation to \r\nfamily planning commodities, striving to eliminate \r\nthe unmet need for family planning, and improving \r\nuniversal coverage through an expanded method mix \r\nand increased access, particularly to the underserved \r\npopulation. Secondly, it is investing in the construction \r\nof 650 health posts in all districts in the country in \r\norder to bring health services closer to the people, \r\nespecially in rural areas. Thirdly, it is implementing \r\nsector devolution.\r\nZambia reaffirms its commitment to the resolution \r\nof the forty-seventh session of the Commission on \r\nPopulation and Development that called for the full \r\nimplementation of the Programme of Action and key \r\nactions for its implementation beyond 2014. These \r\ninclude sexual and reproductive health, reproductive \r\nrights, population and development, education and \r\ngender equality and equity, and they are integrally \r\nlinked to the eradication of poverty and the achievement \r\nof sustainable development.\r\nZambia acknowledges the support rendered by our \r\ncooperating partners, including the United Nations \r\nPopulation Fund, in the implementation of the ICPD \r\nProgramme of Action. In that regard, we wish to \r\nsupport the outcome of the special session in all United \r\nNations organs, including in the Executive Board and \r\nthe Commission on Population and Development, and \r\nto support countries in the further implementation of \r\nthe ICPD agenda, taking into account the findings and \r\nrecommendations of the ICPD Beyond 2014 review.\r\nMr. Baaro (Kiribati): Twenty years have passed \r\nsince the International Conference on Population and \r\nDevelopment (ICPD) in Cairo. We can all agree that \r\nmuch has been done and achieved, as the recent ICPD \r\nBeyond 2014 Global Review Report points out. However, \r\nthe report notes that much more needs to be done. The \r\ninequitable distribution of the gains from the 1994 \r\nProgramme of Action remains a key challenge, one \r\ncompounded both by the ever-changing landscape of \r\nglobal development and by the ever-changing needs and \r\ndemands of our societies and peoples.\r\nAll of the countries studied in the ICPD Beyond \r\n2014 global review conveyed very clear and consistent \r\nmessages. They included the urgent need to eradicate all \r\nforms of inequalities, the importance of reflecting the \r\ndemographics and dynamics of our populations in our \r\ndevelopment agenda and of recognizing that investing \r\nin our people – young, old, women and girls, men and \r\nboys – is of paramount importance. The underlying \r\nmessage conveyed at Cairo remains as valid today as it \r\nwas 20 years ago. It is not about the numbers. It is about \r\npeople. It is about you and me, our children and their \r\nchildren’s children.\r\nIn 1994, our leaders were innovative and \r\ncourageous enough to formulate and advocate the 1994 \r\nCairo Programme of Action. Today, we need to ensure \r\nthat we continue with what is just and what is right for \r\nour people – our people in the global sense – because \r\nwhat was important and what was reflected 20 years \r\nago continues to be pertinent today. Our responsibility \r\nis not limited to the borders that define who we are as \r\nindividual nations, but should also encompass who we \r\nare as global citizens of one global village.\r\nInvesting in our people means investing in our \r\nfuture to ensure that our children and their children \r\nlive a life without prejudice, a life with the ability to \r\nmake informed choices, a life where such choices are \r\nfacilitated and supported by available services, a life \r\nwithout impediments keeping them from claiming what \r\nis rightfully their due, such as the basic necessities of \r\nlife, and a life that they can call their own and that \r\nneither adversely impacts others nor is adversely \r\nimpacted by others. Furthermore, investing in our \r\npeople underlines the strong linkages between the need \r\nto preserve our environment for future generations and \r\nthe paramount necessity to ensure that our one planet \r\nEarth is preserved so it can sustain the lives of future \r\ngenerations.\r\nTwo weeks ago, we concluded one of the most \r\nsuccessful conferences convened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on climate change. We applaud the leadership \r\nand the Secretary-General’s very positive initiative. For \r\nthose of us who live on the front line of the impacts of \r\nclimate change, we welcome Member States’ renewed \r\nfocus and commitments in support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s ambitious announcements and calls for \r\naction. The real challenge now is to translate those \r\ncommitments and announcements into action on the \r\nground.\r\nAt that same conference, we heard the moving voice \r\nof a very talented young woman, Kathy, a poet from our \r\npart of the world, from the Marshall Islands. Her voice \r\nconveyed the apprehension, the concern and the voice of \r\n14-56474 9/13\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.23\r\nmothers from low-lying countries like ours, who lament \r\nwhat the future might well hold for their children and \r\ntheir children’s children in the face of climate change. \r\nSurely, we members of this family of nations and the \r\nmillions of mothers like Kathy around the world share, \r\nor should share, the same ultimate goal — to leave a \r\nbetter future to our children and grandchildren than the \r\none we have inherited from our forefathers.\r\nI am sure those present here also agree that we should \r\nemphasize the sustainable and inclusive development \r\ngoals that are currently under development for the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. Our world today is as diverse \r\nas our world of yesterday; that diversity ranges from \r\nthe different levels of development, economic growth, \r\npopulation demographics, physical and geographical \r\nrealities to security challenges, just to name a few.\r\nHowever, such diversity should not be a divisive \r\nfactor on the path to a new global development and \r\neconomic order. Diversity is the all-important reason \r\nwhy we need a new development framework. We have \r\nreached that stage in global development where we can \r\nno longer ignore the intricate linkages between our \r\nindividual national development path and those of our \r\nneighbours and the world as a whole. To ignore such \r\nintricate linkages is to ignore our fellow global citizens \r\nwho are, or will become, marginalized and who are, or \r\nwill become, vulnerable through no fault or choice of \r\ntheir own.\r\nAs an example, the melting of the massive sheets of \r\nice in the Arctic region owing to climate change will not \r\nonly have a severe impact on life in that Arctic region, \r\nbut will also result in the demise of future generations \r\non the other side of the globe, in particular those living \r\non the most vulnerable low-lying atoll island nations \r\nlike mine, where we are currently are on the front line of \r\nclimate change and the rise in sea levels. And while we \r\nmay be on the front line now, when we fall, others will \r\nbe on the front line, including the many, many millions \r\nof people who live in human settlements, communities, \r\ntowns and cities in low-lying coastal areas around the \r\nglobe.\r\nImmediate and urgent global action is required \r\nnow on climate change. Climate change is a survival \r\nissue. It is a security issue, a human rights issue and a \r\nhuman dignity issue. By acknowledging it as such, we \r\nwill be advocating for the goal described in the ICPD \r\nBeyond 2014 Global Review Report, namely, to ensure \r\nsustainable development by placing the human rights of \r\nall people and individual well-being at the heart of the \r\nfuture development agenda.\r\nThe time to act is now. It is no longer about what \r\ncaused climate change and who is responsible. It is \r\nabout what we can do individually and collectively \r\nabout it as good global citizens The future of our people \r\nand the future of our world will depend on visionary \r\nand innovative leadership. We need a leadership \r\nthat understands the barriers and acknowledges the \r\nchallenges to the equitable distribution of gains. \r\nMost importantly, we need a leadership that takes the \r\nnecessary steps to address such challenges and barriers \r\nto ensure that no one is worse off or left behind.\r\nToday’s discussion is very relevant to the discussions \r\nthat took place a month ago in Samoa at the third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, and two weeks ago during the Climate Change \r\nSummit here at Headquarters and the general debate \r\nthat followed. The Millennium Development Goals \r\nhave guided us to where we are now, and we certainly \r\nwill support a post-2015 development framework that \r\nnot only builds on the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nbut that also reflects the challenges we face today, \r\nembracing the diversity of the world and channelling \r\nit into a sustainable and inclusive development agenda \r\nthat leaves no one behind.\r\nIt is imperative that we act now and work hand in \r\nhand to achieve our ICPD Beyond 2014 goals. Strong \r\nleadership from the United Nations is very crucial, \r\nand I take this opportunity to commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the Executive Director of the United \r\nNations Population Fund for advocating a visionary and \r\nall-encompassing framework for actions that includes \r\nnot just the unmet challenges of yesterday, but those \r\nof today and tomorrow, such as climate change, in the \r\npost-2015 development framework.\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): I am pleased to participate \r\nin the debate on agenda item 13 (b), which is closely \r\nrelated to improving the lives of our people and our \r\nglobal community of nations. This year marks the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development (ICPD) in Cairo, and \r\nit is timely for us to take stock. As the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/69/122) notes, the most recent \r\ndata and assessments confirm that the consensus we \r\nreached in Cairo in 1994 remains valid even today.\r\nThe Maldives is proud of its success during the \r\npast few decades. In the 1980s, the Maldives was \r\n10/13 14-56474\r\nA/69/PV.23 09/10/2014\r\nranked among the world’s 20 poorest nations. In 2011, \r\nwe graduated from least-developed country status, the \r\nthird country to do so. We have brought down maternal \r\nmortality rates from 500 per 100,000 live births in \r\n1990 to 13 per 100,000 live births in 2012, and infant \r\nmortality from 34 per 100,000 live births to 9 per \r\n100,000 live births, respectively. We have consistently \r\nmaintained a literacy rate of 98 per cent for the last \r\n30 years. Under the 2008 Employment Act, we have \r\nguaranteed maternity leave for working mothers with \r\nthree months’ full pay, and we have always provided \r\nequal pay for equal work.\r\nWe have fully achieved five out of the eight \r\nMillennium Development Goals and we are on track \r\nfor achieving the remaining three. While emerging \r\nissues are becoming more prominent, old challenges \r\npersist. As a small island developing State, climate \r\nchange threatens to erode our development gains and \r\nmakes progress on the topics addressed by the ICPD \r\nharder to achieve every step of the way. Equal income \r\ndistribution has remained a constant challenge. While \r\nMaldivan women are among the most emancipated in \r\nSouth Asia, enjoying unhindered access to employment, \r\neducation, health care and social mobility, they have \r\nlimited opportunity for economic empowerment, and \r\ngender-based violence also remains a challenge. That \r\nis why our Government has adopted a zero-tolerance \r\npolicy on violence against women.\r\nThe Government is in the process of enacting \r\na gender equality law that will establish a legal \r\nframework for addressing all forms of discrimination \r\nagainst women. The Government has formulated a \r\ncomprehensive national reproductive health strategy \r\nto ensure access to timely, adequate and quality \r\nreproductive health care. Furthermore, we believe that \r\npublic awareness and education on HIV/AIDS and other \r\nsexually transmitted infections need to be strengthened \r\nand healthy and responsible behaviours encouraged.\r\nMeeting the needs of the youth of the country is a \r\nmajor priority of the Maldives Government. Children \r\nand youth account for 44 per cent of the population \r\nof the Maldives. Unemployment – especially youth \r\nunemployment, which gives rise to a wide-ranging set \r\nof challenges such as drug abuse and delinquency – is \r\nof grave concern for the public and the Government. \r\nMajor projects, such as building a youth city, which \r\nis set to become a major hub of employment and \r\ninnovation, have been announced, and practical work is \r\nunder way for its realization.\r\nProgrammes that identify support and empower \r\nvulnerable groups have been formulated. Under an \r\numbrella programme with a policy under which no child \r\nis left behind, high-risk children are provided with the \r\nnecessary support and care in order to ensure that all \r\nchildren reach their full potential. The Maldives has a \r\ntrack record of formulating policies based on statistical \r\nevidence. Last month, we began a new national \r\ncensus, which will play a central role in helping us to \r\nunderstand the real and current picture of the national \r\npopulation, its strengths and other parameters. Setting \r\na new precedent, collecting data and statistics on the \r\nmigrant population will enable the Government to take \r\nfurther measures to protect and serve the interests of \r\nmigrant workers, who, some estimates show, make up \r\nmore than one third of the local population.\r\nThe Maldives believes that we should take into \r\naccount the evidence and data available to us today \r\nin formulating the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nSustainable development should consider the ecological \r\nlimits of the planet in order make sure that the population \r\nenjoys basic human rights and dignity and experiences \r\nsocioeconomic well-being. In that regard, we call again \r\nfor the inclusion of the report of the Secretary-General \r\nand the regional review outcomes in the discussion on \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn the Maldives, we strongly believe that a nation’s \r\nmost precious resource is its people. That is especially \r\ntrue for a country as small as the Maldives, which has \r\nlimited natural assets. Without human development, \r\nsustainable development cannot be accomplished. We \r\nremain fully committed to the further implementation of \r\nthe ICPD Programme of Action. We remain committed \r\nto our people, especially our youth and women, and to \r\nthe full realization of their potential.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the Observer State of the Holy See.\r\nArchbishop Auza (Holy See): My delegation \r\nwelcomed the convening of the twenty-ninth special \r\nsession of the General Assembly on the follow-up to the \r\nProgramme of Action of the International Conference \r\non Population and Development beyond 2014.\r\nThe Holy See is aware of the many challenges \r\nthat the international community still faces in order \r\nto achieve the goal of greater, sustained economic and \r\nsocial development for all. Therefore, while noting that \r\ngood progress has been made in the past 20 years in \r\nthe reduction of the number of people living in extreme \r\n14-56474 11/13\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.23\r\npoverty, the Holy See remains deeply concerned that \r\n1.2 billion people — or 15 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation — still live in extreme poverty.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that the world’s poor \r\ndeserve and expect even greater results. We should \r\nrefuse, therefore, to be satisfied with the current results \r\nand we must press forward to consolidate the gains and \r\nachieve even more to benefit those left behind. Lifting \r\npeople out of extreme poverty is the best guarantee for \r\nthem to enjoy their basic rights and dignity.\r\nMy delegation wishes to recall that the Programme \r\nof Action of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD) asked States to promote and \r\nstrengthen the family as a vital element in the effort \r\nto produce greater social and economic development. \r\nGovernments and the international community were \r\ncalled upon to devote greater attention to and manifest \r\ngreater solidarity with poor families and those who \r\nhave become victims of war, drought, famine, natural \r\ndisasters, discrimination and violence of every sort. No \r\neffort should be spared to keep their members together, \r\nto reunite them in the event of separation and to ensure \r\naccess to programmes designed to support and assist \r\nthe vulnerable.\r\nWhile individuals and peoples have been on the \r\nmove since time immemorial, migration has become \r\ntruly a phenomenon of our times. Yet, more often than \r\nnot, policy-makers and large segments of society see \r\nmigration only in a negative light. Negative stereotypes \r\nof migrants are used to promote policies detrimental to \r\ntheir rights and dignity. Moreover, migrants, especially \r\nchildren and women, are often victims of trafficking. \r\nThose issues demand our attention when tackling \r\nproblems relating to population and development. There \r\nmust be a way to stop that tragedy, and we must find it.\r\nThe ICPD recognizes that universal access to \r\nquality education is the most effective means for \r\npromoting sustainable economic, social and political \r\ndevelopment. It goes without saying that access to \r\neducation for women and girls at all levels is at the heart \r\nof empowering women within society and of promoting \r\nequality between men and women.\r\nTogether with education, health is a pillar for \r\nreal development. The health-care institutions of \r\nthe Catholic Church throughout the world remain \r\ncommitted to ensuring the right to equal, effective \r\nand morally responsible health care for all. However, \r\nwe also note that the role of the ICPD in the area \r\nof maternal health is sometimes used to promote \r\nreproductive health rights that are detrimental to the \r\nunborn human life and the integral needs of women \r\nthemselves. Efforts to address maternal mortality, \r\nobstetric fistula, child mortality, prenatal and antenatal \r\ncare, sexually transmitted diseases and other health \r\nmatters are sometimes hampered by policies that fail to \r\ntake into account the right to life of the unborn.\r\nSuggesting that reproductive health includes a right \r\nto abortion explicitly violates the language of the ICPD, \r\noften defies moral and legal standards within local \r\ncommunities, and divides efforts to address the real \r\nneeds of mothers and children.\r\nThe Holy See is convinced that all efforts to respond \r\nto the integral needs of communities entail taking into \r\naccount the social, cultural and spiritual needs of all and \r\nadhering to the international standard set by the ICPD, \r\nwhich calls for national laws to be fully respected.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 47/4 of 16 October 1992, I now \r\ngive the f loor to the observer of the International \r\nOrganization for Migration.\r\nMs. Muedin (International Organization for \r\nMigration): One of the most significant contributions \r\nmade by the 1994 International Conference on \r\nPopulation and Development (ICPD) was that it \r\noutlined, through its Programme of Action, the most \r\ncomprehensive internationally agreed text on migration \r\nof its time. Chapters IX and X of the Programme of \r\nAction comprehensively address issues related to both \r\ninternal and international migration. The Programme \r\nwas in many ways a catalyst for the substantial global \r\ndebates and action on migration that have transpired \r\nsince.\r\nWhile our collective appreciation of the links \r\nbetween migration and development has become more \r\nsophisticated and evidence-based since 1994, as was \r\ndemonstrated at last year’s High-level Dialogue on \r\nInternational Migration and Development, it is clear that \r\nthe principles and objectives set forth in the Programme \r\nof Action regarding migration remain vitally relevant to \r\ntoday’s efforts to achieve sustainable development.\r\nIn the early 1990s, the number of international \r\nmigrants was estimated to be 154 million. Today, that \r\nnumber is 232 million - a figure that is expected to \r\ngrow well into the foreseeable future. Contemporary \r\nmigration patterns are significantly more complex than \r\nin the 1990s, a function of both the sheer number of \r\n12/13 14-56474\r\nA/69/PV.23 09/10/2014\r\nmigrants, coming from an increasingly large global \r\npool, and the more diverse economic, social and \r\ncultural backgrounds of migrants. Today, migration, \r\nboth international and domestic, is one of the four major \r\npopulation dynamics that feature prominently in the \r\ndiscussions leading up to the post-2015 United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda to be announced next year.\r\nAs the principal intergovernmental organization \r\nfocused on migration globally, the International \r\nOrganization for Migration (IOM) fully supports \r\nthe report of the Commission on Population and \r\nDevelopment (E/2014/25-E/CN.9/2014/7)). The report \r\nacknowledges that migration has increased in volume, \r\nscope, complexity and impact since the adoption of \r\nthe Programme of Action. It also acknowledges the \r\nimportant link between migration and development, \r\nand states that it is the responsibility of States to \r\npromote and protect the human rights of all migrants. \r\nIOM also supports its call on all States to promote and \r\nprotect effectively the human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration \r\nstatus, and to address international migration through \r\ninternational, regional and bilateral cooperation and \r\ndialogue.\r\nThe Programme of Action’s objectives on \r\nmigration take on new salience and urgency today and \r\nprovide important lessons as we transition to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. In that context, objectives \r\nsuch as ensuring migrants’ social and economic \r\nintegration, eliminating discriminatory practices \r\nand ensuring protection against racism, preventing \r\nmigrant trafficking and exploitation, and providing \r\nadequate health, education and social services for \r\nmigrants, refugees and internally displaced people \r\nare all ,important means for reaching a sustainable \r\ndevelopment goal target of facilitating orderly, safe, \r\nregular and responsible migration.\r\nIOM is working with its partners, including the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General \r\non International Migration and Development, the \r\n18 partner agencies of the Global Migration Group \r\nand civil society representatives, to identify concrete \r\nindicators to help measure and monitor the development \r\npotential of migration and to ensure that the human \r\nand labour rights of migrants, displaced persons and \r\nrefugees are fully realized. That will help ensure the \r\nuniversality of the new development agenda, as well as \r\nensure that no one is left behind.\r\nMigration is inevitable because of demographic, \r\neconomic and environmental factors. Migration is \r\nnecessary to meet labour demands and to ensure the \r\navailability of skills and the vibrancy of economies and \r\nsocieties. And migration is desirable for migrants and \r\nhost populations alike, when governed humanely and \r\nfairly as a path to the realization of human potential. \r\nWe hope that the ICPD’s important contribution to that \r\ndiscourse will continue to stimulate dialogue and action \r\non those issues in 2014 and beyond.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 477 (V) of 1 November 1950, \r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the League of \r\nArab States.\r\nMr. Al-Amri (League of Arab States) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): It gives me great pleasure to address the \r\nAssembly today, on behalf of the League of Arab States, \r\non the occasion of this important special meeting on the \r\nfollow-up to the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development beyond 2014. This meeting can make \r\nan important contribution to the political support \r\nnecessary to achieving the objectives of the Programme \r\nof Action of the International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD) and providing the necessary \r\nsupport to population and development issues.\r\nWe would like to emphasize the importance that \r\nthe secretariat of the Arab League attaches to Arab \r\npopulation issues at all levels, as reflected in the \r\nnational consultations and Committee meetings that \r\nwe have held and in today’s meeting. We have always \r\nbeen keen to participate in all activities held within the \r\nframework of the ICPD since its inception and the first \r\nfive-year review. \r\nIn the light of the critical circumstances and major \r\nchallenges facing the Arab region, it is crucial that \r\nwe instil peace and eradicate violence in all its forms. \r\nWe must spare no effort to overcome the obstacles to \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)\r\nby 2015. In that context, we commend the efforts of the \r\nArab States to tackle population challenges and growth \r\nto advance education, health and living standards \r\nand legal protections for all individuals, as well as to \r\npromote women’s rights and gender equality and to \r\nclose social gaps so that all can enjoy full citizenship.\r\nThe League of Arab States has always sought to \r\ninclude development plans and population issues in \r\ndiscussions at all summits and ministerial meetings, as \r\nwell as at the annual meetings of national committees \r\n14-56474 13/13\r\n09/10/2014 A/69/PV.23\r\nand councils on population, so as to allow for the \r\nsharing of experiences and partnerships in that regard. \r\nI must mention the high-level Regional Conference \r\non Population and Development in the Arab States, \r\nheld in Cairo in 2013 in cooperation with the United \r\nNations Population Fund and the Economic and \r\nSocial Commission for Western Asia. It was a very \r\ncritical juncture for establishing the priorities and \r\nfor discussing challenges in all transparency through \r\nserious and constructive dialogue in that regard. The \r\n2013 Cairo Declaration, issued at that Conference \r\nand endorsed by all Arab States, is the consolidated \r\nArab document expressing our commitment to the \r\nachievement of the ICPD goals beyond 2014, the MDGs \r\nand the post-2015 sustainable development goals. That \r\nis why we requested that the Commission on Population \r\nand Development include the Cairo Declaration as an \r\nofficial document at its forty-seventh session.\r\nThe advancement of the Arab vision of population \r\nand development priorities is the building block for \r\nour sustainable partnership, which should lead to the \r\ndevelopment of transparent and fair Arab population \r\npolicies and plans. Here, we must refer to the partnership \r\nestablished between the League of Arab States and the \r\nUnited Nations Population Fund at the international, \r\nnational and regional levels. The partnership aims \r\nto achieve population goals that run parallel to the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nand to follow up on all those achievements through the \r\nmany meetings held since 1998.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my thanks \r\nand appreciation for all the efforts made to achieve \r\nthe agreed population and development goals, which \r\nrepresent our common endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker of the debate on this sub-item.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 13.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.20 p.m.\r\n"
