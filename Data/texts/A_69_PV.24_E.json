I \r\nwish you a successful term of duty.\r\nThis is my third appearance before the General \r\nAssembly in my capacity as President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). \r\nIt remains an immense honour for me to address the \r\nmembers of the Assembly, and it is my pleasure to \r\npresent the nineteenth annual report of the ICTR (see \r\nA/69/206). The report details the progress made in \r\nthe past year towards the completion of the Tribunal’s \r\nmandate and the transition to the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\r\nI will begin by providing a brief overview of the \r\nwork undertaken throughout the reporting period, from \r\n1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014. During that period the \r\nTribunal continued its effort to complete the remaining \r\nappeals expeditiously while respecting the rights of the \r\naccused, transferred a second accused in its custody \r\nto Rwanda for trial and made significant progress in \r\nthe ongoing transition of functions to the Mechanism. \r\nI will also update the Assembly on the progress since \r\nthe close of the reporting period, which included the \r\ndelivery of three additional appeal judgements.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the work before the ICTR \r\nTrial Chambers has been complete since December \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.24\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n24th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 13 October 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\n2012, and the Tribunal’s remaining judicial work is \r\nnow focused in the Appeals Chamber. During the \r\nreporting period, the Appeals Chamber rendered three \r\njudgements concerning five persons in the Ndahimana, \r\nNdindiliyimana et. al. and the Bizimungu cases. In \r\naddition to those issued during the reporting period, \r\non 29 September 2014, the Appeals Chamber delivered \r\na further three judgments concerning four persons in \r\nthe Karemera and Ngirumpatse, the Nizeyimana, and the \r\nNzabonimana cases. I also note that the Ngirabatware \r\nappeal, which originates from the Tribunal’s final trial, \r\nis currently pending before the Mechanism and remains \r\nprojected for completion before the end of 2014.\r\nI am pleased to report that as of 29 September 2014, \r\nthe Appeals Chamber has completed all of its work, \r\nwith the exception of one case, Nyiramasuhuko et al. \r\n(“Butare”), which involves six persons and remains \r\nprojected for completion in 2015. It will be no small feat \r\nto complete an appeal of that size in such a relatively \r\nshort time. That the completion remains on track \r\nwithout any further delays, despite the unprecedented \r\namount of pre-appeal work and the complexity of the \r\ncase, is a testament to the dedication of all of the judges \r\nand their staff in the Appeals Chamber. \r\nIn light of the latest projected completion date of \r\nthe Butare appeal judgement and the involvement of the \r\nICTR judges in cases before the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, a request for \r\nextension of the terms of office of the judges in line \r\nwith projected completion of our work was recently \r\nmade. I hope that the Member States will support that \r\nrequest, as it is crucial that the Tribunals complete the \r\nremaining work and reach orderly completion of our \r\nmandates.\r\nI feel that it is incumbent upon me to take this \r\nopportunity to commend the Appeals Chamber, as \r\nwell as the entirety of the staff of the ICTR, for their \r\ncontinued hard work. The significant progress we \r\nhave achieved towards the completion of our mandate \r\nand the transition to the Mechanism would not have \r\nbeen possible without their persevering efforts. As we \r\nnear the end of our mandate and continue to work to \r\ncomplete the final appeal without delay, the staff who \r\nremain at the ICTR are among the most dedicated and \r\nprofessional individuals in the Organization. That \r\nis evidenced by the fact that many have sacrificed \r\nopportunities for more secure and lucrative employment \r\nprospects in order to see their work through until \r\nthe end. I hope that Member States will continue to \r\nencourage the Secretariat and other United Nations \r\nentities to strongly consider applications from ICTR \r\nstaff members, particularly those who remain with the \r\nTribunal until completion of contract.\r\nI turn next to cases referred to national jurisdictions. \r\nThe ICTR transferred Bernard Munyagishari to \r\nRwanda in July 2013, marking the second and final \r\ntransfer from the ICTR to Rwanda of an accused in \r\ncustody. There are now four cases pending in national \r\njurisdictions from ICTR indictments – two in Rwanda \r\nand two in France. Six fugitive cases have also been \r\ntransferred to Rwanda, leaving only three fugitives to \r\nbe tried by the Mechanism. \r\nThe function of monitoring the referred cases now \r\nrests solely with the Mechanism. During the reporting \r\nperiod, however, the Tribunal provided staff to assist the \r\nMechanism with monitoring the two cases transferred \r\nto Rwanda and the two cases referred to France. Staff \r\nfrom the Judicial and Legal Affairs Section of the \r\nTribunal based in Arusha acted as interim monitors of \r\nthe proceedings in Rwanda during part of the reporting \r\nperiod, and an Appeals Chamber staff member in \r\nThe Hague continues to act as interim monitor for \r\nthe cases transferred to France. Both have submitted \r\nregular reports to the Mechanism, and the Tribunal \r\nhas followed the progress closely and will continue to \r\nprovide support as required until its closure. I would \r\nlike to express my deep gratitude to the staff members \r\nwho have agreed to take on those important roles in \r\naddition to their core duties, and to commend them \r\nfor ensuring that serving as monitors has caused no \r\ndetriment to their regular workload.\r\nI will now provide an update on the transfer \r\nof archives to the Mechanism. The ICTR worked \r\nvigorously during the reporting period to continue the \r\nhard work of preparing its records for preservation \r\nby the Mechanism, which will also ensure ease of \r\naccess to them for posterity. In that respect, the \r\nTribunal continues preparing its paper, electronic and \r\naudiovisual records for transfer to, and management by, \r\nthe Mechanism. That work is done in collaboration with \r\nthe Mechanism in order to ensure that the records will \r\nbe easily manageable after their transfer. \r\nIn addition to the inventory and appraisal of the \r\nICTR records and the planning and implementation of \r\nthe transfer process, the Tribunal is also working on the \r\nredaction of audio-visual records of trial proceedings. \r\nThose records, which are most important for ensuring \r\nthat the events in Rwanda will never be forgotten, \r\n14-56573 3/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nmay also serve as road maps for the creation of future \r\ninternational tribunals and – possibly almost as \r\nimportantly – can be used to further empower domestic \r\ncourts and educate the world on the importance of \r\nchallenging impunity. \r\nDespite persistent staffing challenges, the Tribunal \r\nhas made significant progress in the preparation \r\nand transfer of its records to the Mechanism. As of \r\n1 October, the Mechanism had received approximately \r\n47 per cent of the physical ICTR records, which will \r\nbe housed in the Mechanism’s archives. That does not \r\ninclude the Prosecutor’s archives, which I will discuss \r\nnext. I especially thank all the staff working on that \r\nimportant project and commend them on the work they \r\nhave completed with distinction.\r\nI next turn to the Office of the Prosecutor, which \r\nhas made significant progress towards completing the \r\nprosecution of ongoing appeals, monitoring the cases \r\nreferred to national jurisdictions and ensuring a smooth \r\nand efficient transfer of functions, archives and records \r\nto the Mechanism. \r\nDuring the reporting period, the Office continued \r\nlitigation on 26 appeals in seven cases. It also handed \r\nover responsibility for the tracking of fugitives to \r\nthe Mechanism and provided support to Rwandan \r\nauthorities in the prosecution of crimes and in \r\npreparing for the transfer of cases from the Tribunal. \r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor formally transferred \r\none of its archival facilities along with the records \r\nof 27 cases for archiving to the Mechanism during \r\nthe reporting period. The processing of prosecutorial \r\nrecords continues and processing of the entirety of the \r\nOffice’s archives is expected to be finished upon the \r\ncompletion of all appeals.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has also been \r\nexemplary in its work on a number of projects that will \r\nbe important in shaping the legacy of the Tribunal. \r\nThrough those projects, it has strengthened the capacity \r\nof national criminal justice systems to effectively and \r\nefficiently prosecute international crimes. In September \r\n2013, the Office published a manual on the tracking \r\nand arrest of fugitives from international justice. \r\nThat initiative will assist national authorities, like \r\nRwanda, to track and arrest outstanding fugitives. The \r\nprosecution of cases of sexual violence also continues \r\nto be an important objective of the Office. In order \r\nto empower those in charge of prosecuting violence \r\nagainst women, the Office released a best-practices \r\nmanual on the prosecution of sexual and gender-based \r\nviolence in Kampala in January 2014. National and \r\ninternational prosecutors from around the world will \r\nbenefit from both manuals.\r\nI now return to an important concern that the \r\nICTR has raised in both the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council for years, that of relocating acquitted \r\npersons and those released after serving their sentences. \r\nSince 2011, the Security Council has called upon \r\nMember States to assist the Tribunal with the relocation \r\nof acquitted and released persons who are currently \r\nresiding in Arusha. During the reporting period the \r\nTribunal continued to search for host countries for the \r\nnine acquitted and three convicted released persons. \r\nWe are happy to report that the number of acquitted \r\npersons in Arusha was recently reduced to eight. In that \r\nregard, I must commend the Kingdom of Belgium for \r\nits recent agreement to reunite one of the Tribunal’s \r\nacquitted persons, Augustin Ndindiliyimana, with his \r\nfamily who live in Belgium. However, apart from the \r\nrecent acceptance by Belgium of one acquitted person, \r\nthere have been few developments in that area despite \r\ntremendous efforts, especially by the Registrar. who \r\nworks constantly to find solutions. Those efforts have \r\nbeen made through meetings with representatives of \r\nseveral African and European countries, including the \r\nGovernment of Rwanda.\r\nMore recently, Rwanda has provided assurances \r\nthat the acquitted and released persons are welcome \r\nto return to Rwanda, that they will not be harmed or \r\nprosecuted and that their properties will be handed back \r\nto them. However, the acquitted and released persons \r\nare reluctant to return due to fear of prosecution and \r\nreprisals from others, and there is no means for the \r\nTribunal to assess the existence of any perceived threat \r\nthey allege.\r\nAs I have stated in the past, I remain deeply \r\nconcerned that no solution has yet been identified. \r\nWhile Member States continue to voice support for the \r\nrelocation of those persons – and the recent progress in \r\nBelgium is a step in the right direction – much more is \r\nneeded if the ICTR can hope to make any progress prior \r\nto its closure. As of 1 January 2015, the Mechanism \r\nwill take over the formal responsibility for relocation, \r\nwith assistance from the Tribunal until the resolution of \r\nthe problem or our closure. The urgent assistance of all \r\nMember States is essential to ensure that we do not fail \r\nto relocate the remaining eight acquitted persons and \r\nthree convicted released persons in Arusha.\r\n4/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nThis has been a remarkable year, especially since \r\nApril marked the passage of 20 years since the genocide \r\nin Rwanda. To pay homage to the over 800,000 men, \r\nwomen and children killed in April 1994, the ICTR led \r\nand participated in commemoration events throughout \r\nthe Great Lakes region. Events of that sort help \r\nfacilitate the healing process in Rwanda and ensure \r\nthat the international community never forgets, never \r\nagain closes its eyes to genocide and honours those who \r\nlost their lives by learning from the events in Rwanda \r\nin an effort to ensure our ultimate goal of preventing \r\ntragedies of that kind from ever taking place again.\r\nI wish to especially thank the Government of \r\nRwanda for inviting representatives from the Tribunal \r\nto participate in its official twentieth commemoration \r\nevent, which demonstrated Rwanda’s tremendous \r\nresolve in rebuilding its society, especially its judicial \r\nmechanisms, after the genocide. It further reminded the \r\ninternational community of the need for truth, justice \r\nand reconciliation in the wake of such atrocities.\r\nAs the Tribunal approaches its own milestone – the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of its creation by the Security \r\nCouncil – we remain committed to preserving its \r\nlegacy and to sharing developed practices and lessons \r\nlearned with other international and domestic judicial \r\nmechanisms, as part of efforts to continue the fight \r\nagainst impunity. To highlight the achievements of and \r\nthe lessons learned by the ICTR and to discuss its impact \r\non the development of international humanitarian law, \r\nthe administration of justice and the promotion of the \r\nrule of law, particularly in the Great Lakes region, the \r\nICTR plans to hold a legacy symposium and other events \r\nin Arusha, which will culminate with a ceremony on \r\n8 November 2014 commemorating the establishment of \r\nthe ICTR. The symposium will bring together experts \r\nin the field of international justice, including jurists, \r\nacademics, civil society members and others, who will \r\nref lect on the legacy of the ICTR and the future of \r\ninternational justice.\r\nBefore closing, I would be remiss if I did not also \r\nemphasize the efforts made by the Tribunal to ensure \r\nthat the affected communities and the international \r\ncommunity understand the ramifications of the \r\ngenocide and the lessons we have learned in our battle \r\nagainst impunity. In that context, the Office of the \r\nRegistrar continues to play a key role through outreach \r\nprogrammes aimed at training legal professionals, \r\nconducting genocide-awareness workshops and media \r\noutreach events and distributing materials about the \r\nICTR and the genocide to schools, local governments \r\nand members of the public.\r\nFurther, the sharing of developed practices between \r\nthe international criminal tribunals and the International \r\nCriminal Court is another important initiative launched \r\nby the Tribunal this year. The goal of those developed-\r\npractices workshops is to bring together legal officers \r\nfrom the international and hybrid criminal tribunals \r\nto discuss and share developed practices and lessons \r\nlearned. However, those important workshops will not \r\nbe able to continue without further funding. It is our \r\nhope that Member States will consider supporting that \r\nimportant initiative.\r\nIt remains my honour to address the Assembly \r\nonce more. With only one appeals case remaining, the \r\nTribunal’s mandate is nearly complete. On behalf of \r\nthe entire Tribunal, I wish to express our gratitude to \r\nmembers’ Governments for supporting the work of the \r\nTribunal and helping in our collective fight to challenge \r\nimpunity. But there is still work left to do. I have full \r\nconfidence that, with the support of Member States, the \r\nICTR commitment to the sentiment that never again \r\nshould f lagrant violations of international criminal \r\nand humanitarian law go unpunished will continue to \r\nevolve in a meaningful way and lead to the eventual \r\nrealization of our goal of ending impunity.\r\nThe President: I now call on Judge Theodor Meron, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia and of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\r\nJudge Meron (International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia and International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals): It is my privilege \r\nto appear before the General Assembly, and to do so \r\nunder the presidency of Uganda, in my dual capacity \r\nas President of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and as President \r\nof the Residual Mechanism for International Criminal \r\nTribunals.\r\nI would first like to extend my congratulations to \r\nyou, Sir, on Uganda’s assumption of the presidency. \r\nI wish you every success in the months ahead. I \r\nalso wish to recognize the continuing support and \r\nassistance provided to the ICTY and the Mechanism \r\nby the Security Council’s Informal Working Group on \r\nInternational Tribunals, the staff of the Office of the \r\nLegal Counsel and the Legal Counsel himself, and to \r\nextend my deepest gratitude to them.\r\n14-56573 5/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nIn my remarks today, I will refrain from providing \r\na recap of the written reports submitted on behalf of \r\neach of the two institutions I represent. Instead, I will \r\nunderscore key successes achieved by, and challenges \r\nfacing, the ICTY and the Mechanism. Let me first turn \r\nto the ICTY.\r\nSince my last report to the Assembly (see A/68/\r\nPV.33), the Tribunal has made steady progress in \r\ncompleting its last remaining cases. Indeed, fewer than \r\n10 trials and appeals remain unfinished. Two appeal \r\njudgements were rendered this year, and an additional \r\none, involving five individuals convicted at trial, is \r\nexpected in the next three months. By the end of 2015, \r\nbased on current forecasts, we expect that only one trial \r\nand one appeal, in the Mladić and Prlić et al. cases, will \r\nstill be ongoing, concluding in 2017. That continuing \r\nprogress in carrying out the ICTY’s mandate is possible \r\nthanks to the hard work and dedication of the judges \r\nand staff of the Tribunal.\r\nAs the ICTY completes its judicial work, \r\npreparing for its full closure in 2017, we are focused \r\non downsizing the institution as rapidly as possible \r\nwhile also ensuring that judicial work continues to \r\nconform to the highest international standards. In that \r\nregard, judges and staff members of the Tribunal are \r\nparticularly grateful to the Office of Human Resources \r\nManagement (OHRM) for its f lexibility in accepting \r\ncertain departures from standard United Nations \r\nregulations in order to facilitate recruitment and staff \r\nretention at a downsizing institution. That f lexibility is \r\ncrucial to helping the Tribunal complete its mission in a \r\ntimely manner, and I hope that OHRM will continue to \r\nbe supportive of any similar requests in future.\r\nOf course, as is inevitable for a pioneering \r\ninstitution, the ICTY continues to face certain \r\nchallenges, both in the context of individual cases \r\nand in preparing for its eventual closure. For example, \r\ngiven the complexity of the cases we address – which \r\noften involve thousands of exhibits, hundreds of \r\nwitnesses, massive translation requirements – and the \r\ncomplications of distance, some delays and setbacks \r\nare inevitable. Those difficulties should not, however, \r\neither distract us or detract from the very significant \r\nachievements of the Tribunal, which far outpace the \r\nexpectations of even the most optimistic observers \r\nin 1993, the year of our founding. Our success since \r\nthen is a testament to the international community’s \r\ndedication to the rule of law and a symbol of Member \r\nStates’ common commitment to ending impunity.\r\nPerhaps the greatest challenges faced by the \r\nTribunal at this stage involve staff morale and ensuring \r\nthat we have enough qualified staff to allow our cases \r\nto be completed, despite the fact that staff members \r\nwill all be losing their jobs soon as a result of the \r\ncompletion of the Tribunal’s mandate. My colleagues \r\nand I are continuously reminded of, and grateful for, \r\nthe extraordinary efforts made by staff to help carry out \r\nthe Tribunal’s remaining work.\r\nPlease do not underestimate the key role that the \r\ninternational community plays in that regard as well. \r\nBeyond the broad practical assistance the Tribunal has \r\nbeen afforded, the international community’s sustained \r\nsupport for our work over the last two decades and \r\nto this very day is both an affirmation of a common \r\ncommitment to the principle of accountability and \r\nto the rule of law and a key source of inspiration for \r\nthe Tribunal’s staff members. It has helped to ensure \r\nthat they keep their focus on completing the ICTY’s \r\nlast, historic cases expeditiously and to the highest \r\nstandards of quality. And for this, I wish to offer my \r\nsincere thanks.\r\nI will now turn to the work of the Mechanism.\r\nIt gives me great pleasure to report that the \r\nMechanism continues to make excellent progress in \r\nassuming relevant functions and that it has already \r\ncompleted or is in the process of completing the transfer \r\nof responsibilities from the ICTY and the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) with regard to \r\nwitness protection, archives and other matters. In this \r\nrespect, I am particularly grateful to my colleague \r\nand friend, President Joensen, and to the prosecutors, \r\nregistrars, judges and staff of the ICTR and ICTY for \r\ntheir continued cooperation and assistance. As the two \r\nTribunals prepare to bring their operations to a close, \r\nthe Mechanism is also assuming responsibility for \r\nadministrative functions and is making good progress \r\nin preparing for construction of a permanent building \r\nin Arusha, in accordance with the parameters approved \r\nby the General Assembly.\r\nThe Mechanism has also already undertaken a range \r\nof judicial work. It is on track to deliver its first appeal \r\njudgement by the end of the year and has rendered \r\ndecisions and orders on a variety of other matters. The \r\nMechanism is also keenly aware of its responsibility to \r\ncooperate with authorities in national jurisdictions and \r\nhas processed various requests for access to evidence \r\nfrom proceedings of the ICTR and ICTY.\r\n6/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nIn addition to completing the smooth transfer of \r\nremaining functions from the ICTR and ICTY, the \r\nMechanism faces two pre-eminent challenges. The first \r\nof those challenges is working with the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that the nine individuals indicted \r\nby the ICTR but not yet arrested are apprehended. Six \r\nof those cases have been referred to Rwanda for trials \r\nshould they be apprehended, while the three most senior \r\nwill be tried by the Mechanism. The ICTY’s success \r\nin accounting for each of the individuals it indicted \r\nis a remarkable achievement of international criminal \r\njustice. Realizing the same result with respect to ICTR \r\nindictees is essential to maintaining that legacy. The \r\nProsecutor of the Mechanism continues to undertake \r\nimportant efforts to track remaining indictees, and \r\nI would call upon every State Member of the United \r\nNations to assist those efforts to the utmost.\r\nA second challenge that will soon be fully assumed \r\nby the Mechanism involves the relocation of individuals \r\nwho were acquitted by the ICTR or who have finished \r\nserving sentences imposed by it but who are unable or \r\nafraid to return to their country of citizenship. The total \r\nnumber of those individuals is very small. However, \r\nit is vital to the credibility of international justice \r\ninstitutions and the United Nations as a whole that they \r\nbe appropriately relocated. Efforts to find countries \r\nwilling to accept those individuals have heretofore \r\nnot been sufficiently successful. Accordingly, I would \r\nurge each delegation present today to discuss with their \r\nGovernments the possibility of accepting one or more \r\nacquitted or released individuals.\r\nOf course, the Mechanism also faces a number \r\nof additional challenges. However, I am very \r\nconfident that with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, including our host States – Tanzania \r\nand the Netherlands – the Mechanism will continue \r\nto make progress in fulfilling its mandate, serving \r\nas a worthy successor to the ICTR and ICTY. We are \r\ncontinually striving to adopt the best practices of those \r\ntwo predecessor institutions, while ensuring that we \r\ncarry out our limited mandate by the most efficient and \r\neffective means possible.\r\nAs a scholar of international law and justice and \r\nan international judge for more than a dozen years, I \r\nknow all too well the long history of efforts – moral and \r\npractical, political and judicial – undertaken to address \r\nthe worst crimes that often accompany war. Humankind \r\nhas, time and again, condemned those atrocities, but \r\nhistorically – and tragically – such condemnations have \r\nhad a very limited real effect.\r\nGiven all of that, I never cease to be struck by the \r\nfact that with the founding of the ICTR and ICTY, just \r\ntwo decades ago, the United Nations achieved a unity \r\nof purpose in favour of justice that, both symbolically \r\nand materially, had eluded the international community \r\nfor centuries. The system of international criminal \r\njustice that we enjoy today – including the ICTR, the \r\nICTY and the Mechanism, as well as the world’s first \r\npermanent International Criminal Court – is a profound \r\nand lasting achievement. With the continued support of \r\nthe international community, it is my fervent hope that \r\nthose institutions will serve as harbingers of a new era, \r\nof a new world, where respect for the rule of law is \r\nuniversal and the concept of impunity is relegated to \r\nhistory.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and \r\nits member States. The candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania, as well as Armenia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nWe reaffirm our unwavering support for the work \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. We praise \r\nboth Tribunals for their achievements and invaluable \r\ncontributions to our shared goal of ending impunity for \r\nserious international crimes. We welcome the fact that \r\nthe Mechanism is now operating on two continents and \r\nperforming functions inherited from both the ICTR \r\nand the ICTY. We thank President Meron and President \r\nJoensen for their reports and commend them for their \r\nefforts in completing the work of the Tribunals. We also \r\npay special tribute to the work of all the staff of the \r\nTribunals and the Mechanism. It is important that both \r\nTribunals and the Mechanism receive the necessary \r\nsupport to complete their mandates.\r\nThe Tribunals have played a key role in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and promoting long-term \r\nstability and reconciliation. Since their establishment, \r\nboth Tribunals have embodied the need to fight impunity \r\nand the refusal by the international community to let the \r\n14-56573 7/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern escape justice. They were forerunners in \r\ncreating jurisprudence in their field. They paved the \r\nway for the International Criminal Court.\r\nBoth Tribunals have continued to hand over \r\nresponsibilities to the Mechanism, and we welcome the \r\nfact that the staff of the three institutions have worked \r\ntogether closely, sharing institutional knowledge, \r\nexpertise and lessons learned. Such a smooth transition \r\nprocess is important in order for both branches of \r\nthe Mechanism to carry on and protect the work of \r\nthe Tribunals. Finally, we note with satisfaction that \r\nboth Tribunals are committed to completing their \r\nproceedings in an efficient and timely manner, without \r\ncompromising fair trial rights.\r\nWe recall that States’ responsibility to cooperate \r\nwith the Tribunals and the Mechanism remains crucial \r\nfor their ability to complete their mandates, particularly \r\ncooperation in bringing those indicted to justice.\r\nWith respect to the ICTR, we recall that despite \r\ncontinuing appeals by the international community, \r\nnine accused individuals remain at large. The failure to \r\narrest those fugitives is a matter of grave concern. We \r\nnote with appreciation that the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nof the Mechanism focuses, among other tasks, on the \r\ntracking of the remaining fugitives indicted by the ICTR \r\nand that the Prosecutor continues to receive support \r\nfrom INTERPOL and some United Nations Member \r\nStates, including through the United States’ War Crimes \r\nRewards Programme. We call upon all States concerned \r\nto intensify their efforts and cooperation with the \r\nArusha branch of the Mechanism in order to achieve \r\nthe arrest and surrender of all remaining fugitives. \r\nEnhanced cooperation of the United Nations Member \r\nStates on the issue of relocation is also needed in order \r\nfor the Tribunal to be successful in implementing its \r\nstrategic plan for relocation prior to its closure.\r\nOn 8 November, the ICTR will mark 20 years \r\nsince its creation by the Security Council. At the same \r\ntime, there will be approximately one year remaining \r\nuntil the projected closure of the Tribunal. The support \r\nof the international community is necessary for the \r\ncompletion of the ICTR’s mandate.\r\nWith regard to the ICTY, we note that at the closure \r\nof the reporting period, fewer than ten trials and appeals \r\nwere pending and that there were no outstanding \r\nindictments for violations of core statutory crimes. \r\nWe note that in the ICTY report (see A/69/225), the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor acknowledges the assistance it \r\nreceived from the European Union and the EU member \r\nStates, and we will continue to support that Office.\r\nWe welcome the fact the Office of the Prosecutor \r\ncontinued to provide information on the ongoing ICTY \r\ncases to assist national jurisdictions in prosecuting \r\ncrimes arising out of the conflict in the former \r\nYugoslavia, and that the joint European Union/\r\nICTY liaison prosecutors project remained a central \r\ncomponent of the Office’s strategy in that regard. We \r\nalso note that the States concerned remain committed to \r\nmeeting their obligations towards justice. Completing \r\nthe process of rendering justice for crimes committed \r\nduring the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia is an \r\nessential contribution to lasting reconciliation. Full \r\ncooperation with the ICTY therefore remains an \r\nessential condition for the Stabilisation and Association \r\nProcess in the Western Balkans and is an essential \r\ncondition for membership of the European Union.\r\nWe welcome the work of the Tribunals and the \r\nMechanism on strengthening the capacity of national \r\nauthorities to handle the remaining war crimes \r\ncases effectively. We fully support the training and \r\ninformation exchanges, as well as the access to material \r\nand evidence from the Tribunals that is publicly available \r\nfor investigating. That is important for the Tribunals’ \r\nlegacy and for the domestic capacity to adjudicate war \r\ncrimes. In its Stabilisation and Association Process for \r\nthe Western Balkans, the EU is increasingly underlining \r\nthe importance of local ownership for handling war \r\ncrimes cases, in line with the need to fight impunity.\r\nWe note that the Office of the Prosecutor continued \r\nto promote improved regional cooperation among States \r\nof the former Yugoslavia in judicial matters, and we \r\nwelcome the signature of the protocol on the exchange of \r\ninformation and evidence in war crimes cases adopted \r\nbetween Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro \r\non 29 April. However, many challenges remain in \r\ncoordinating the activities of judicial institutions in \r\nparts of the region, and we note the serious concerns \r\nexpressed by the Office of the Prosecutor in the parts of \r\nthe report addressing national war crimes prosecution. \r\nWe note the recent increase in staff numbers in the \r\nProsecutor’s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which \r\nshould advance the implementation of the national war \r\ncrimes strategy in the upcoming period.\r\nWe note that the Arusha branch of the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor continued to monitor progress in cases \r\ntransferred to national jurisdictions and that substantial \r\n8/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nprogress has been achieved in certain proceedings. \r\nWe continue to urge all States to cooperate with both \r\nTribunals and branches of the Mechanism, in full \r\ncompliance with their obligations under the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nFinally, we welcome the steps taken by the \r\nTribunals and the Mechanism in terms of capacity-\r\nbuilding, dissemination of information and legacy. We \r\nrecall the importance of the preservation of archives in \r\nthe transition process to the Mechanism, as they remain \r\nan integral part of the history and the memory of both \r\nRwanda and countries of the former Yugoslavia. We will \r\ncontinue to support both the principle and the system \r\nof international criminal justice and its essential role \r\nin the reconciliation process, and we call on all States \r\nto do the same. It is indeed important that knowledge \r\ngained and lessons learned in the fight against impunity \r\nare not forgotten.\r\nMr. McLay (New Zealand): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Canada, Australia and New Zealand \r\n(CANZ).\r\nCANZ reaffirms its strong support for the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals.\r\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe ICTR, with the ICTY having reached that same \r\nmilestone last year. Over that time, the Tribunals have \r\nelaborated the practice of international law through the \r\nadministration and management of complex criminal \r\nproceedings. They have added breadth and depth to \r\ninternational criminal law jurisprudence, administering \r\njustice in cases involving some of the most horrific \r\ncrimes in recent history.\r\nCANZ acknowledges the Tribunals’ efforts as \r\nthey implement their completion strategies, all the \r\nwhile ensuring, as the Presidents have emphasized, \r\nthat fundamental procedural safeguards are met. The \r\nICTR has completed work on substantive cases at the \r\ntrial level for all 93 accused, including transferring the \r\ncases of three fugitives to the Residual Mechanism and \r\nthe cases of six other fugitives to Rwanda. The Tribunal \r\nhas completed appellate proceedings in respect of 15 \r\nindividuals, and all but one of the remaining appeals \r\nwill be completed in this year, 2014.\r\nSignificantly, there are no fugitives at large from \r\nthe ICTY. It now enjoys its full complement of judges \r\nand has concluded proceedings against 141 of 161 \r\nindictees. Four trials and five appeals continue before \r\nthe ICTY, including the trials of three of the most \r\nsenior indicted figures, demonstrating that critical \r\nwork remains to be done and that the Tribunals must \r\nreceive the full support of the international community \r\nuntil their mandates are completed. We encourage the \r\nICTY to continue ensuring that those proceedings are \r\nadvanced efficiently and effectively.\r\nIn addition to judicial proceedings, both the ICTY \r\nand the ICTR have engaged in wider activities that \r\ncontribute to the advancement of international criminal \r\njustice.\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts of the Tribunals, CANZ \r\nnotes that States also have a central role as facilitators of \r\nthat important work, in which regard we acknowledge \r\nthat the final apprehension of standing ICTY fugitives \r\nwas due, in very large part, to the cooperation of \r\nStates and the ICTY Prosecutor. We encourage similar \r\ncooperation on the part of all States in relation to the \r\noutstanding ICTR fugitives, including cooperation \r\nwith the Residual Mechanism, pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2150 (2014). We also urge Member \r\nStates to assist with enforcing sentences and improving \r\nconditions in places of detention for convicted persons. \r\nOf particular concern to CANZ is the situation of the \r\nnine persons acquitted and released by the ICTR and \r\nthe three who have completed their sentences and are \r\nstill awaiting relocation.\r\nCANZ reiterates its support for Security Council \r\nresolution 1966 (2010) of December 2010, in which the \r\nCouncil decided to establish the Residual Mechanism.\r\nThat decision is integral to ensuring that the rule \r\nof law, the practical application of criminal justice, \r\nthe protection of witnesses and the maintenance of \r\nTribunal archives all continue beyond the completion \r\nof the Tribunals’ respective mandates. The most recent \r\nICTY and ICTR reports (see A/69/225 and A/69/206) \r\ndemonstrate a commitment to ensuring that remaining \r\nTribunal activities are effectively transferred to the \r\nResidual Mechanism.\r\nThe successful completion of the work of the \r\nTribunals and their ultimate legacy for international \r\ncriminal justice are in very large part dependent on \r\nthe individual and collective efforts of us, the Member \r\nStates. For their part, Canada, Australia and New \r\nZealand will continue to offer their full cooperation \r\nand support for the Tribunals and for the Residual \r\n14-56573 9/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nMechanism, thus giving practical effect to our \r\ncommitment to international criminal justice.\r\nMs. Stener (Norway): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the five Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, \r\nIceland, Sweden and my own country, Norway.\r\nThis year the world commemorated the fact that \r\n20 years have passed since the genocide in Rwanda in \r\n1994. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR) should be commended for its role in ensuring \r\ncriminal justice for the horrendous crimes that were \r\ncommitted and in developing international criminal \r\nlaw. Following the three appeals judgements that \r\nwere issued on 29 September this year, the remaining \r\ncaseload of the ICTR Appeals Chamber consists of just \r\none case, which is expected to be heard in 2015.\r\nNext year, 20 years will have passed since the \r\ngenocide in Srebrenica, Bosnia. As the first ad \r\nhoc tribunal to be established, the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) \r\nhas consistently served as a catalyst for important \r\ndevelopments in international criminal law. Fewer than \r\n10 cases remain to be heard at the ICTY at this point – \r\nfour trials and five appeals. All of the 161 indicted \r\nindividuals have been accounted for. The ICTY has \r\nworked actively to prevent potential delays caused by \r\nthe heavy work load of the Appeals Chamber, and its \r\nefforts have, in our view, been successful.\r\nThe Nordic countries would like to applaud the \r\nsignificant achievements of the ICTR and ICTY \r\nover the past 20 years. In particular, both Tribunals \r\ndeserve praise for their work in the area of sexual and \r\ngender-based violence. The Office of the Prosecutor \r\nat the ICTR released a best practices manual on the \r\ninvestigation and prosecution of sexual and gender-\r\nbased violence in January this year. We hope that the \r\nICTY’s vast experience in handling such cases will also \r\nbe passed on to relevant stakeholders and practitioners \r\nin such a document. Both Tribunals are, however, still \r\nfunctioning and in need of continued support from the \r\ninternational community. It is crucial that the Tribunals \r\nbe allocated sufficient resources to complete their tasks \r\nin the expected timeframe.\r\nAnother issue of importance to the successful \r\ncompletion of the mandate of the ICTR is the need to \r\nrelocate acquitted persons and convicted individuals \r\nwho have completed their sentences and been released, \r\nand who are currently residing in Arusha. That is an \r\nissue the international community should address \r\ncollectively.\r\nThe Mechanism for International Criminal \r\nTribunals was established in 2010 as a key component \r\nof the completion strategies of the two Tribunals. \r\nThe Mechanism is a temporary body, tasked with \r\ncontinuing the jurisdiction, rights and obligations, \r\nand essential functions of the ICTR and the ICTY and \r\nwith maintaining the legacy of both institutions after \r\nthe completion of their mandates. It will perform a \r\nnumber of critical functions, such as tracking and \r\nprosecuting remaining fugitives and conducting \r\nappeals proceedings and retrials and trials for contempt \r\nof court. The Mechanism is also tasked with other \r\nimportant responsibilities, including protecting victims \r\nand witnesses, supervising the enforcement of sentences \r\nand supporting national jurisdictions. It is essential to \r\nensure sufficient support for the Mechanism, including \r\nsatisfactory funding, so that it can perform its tasks and \r\nmaintain the legacy of the ad hoc Tribunals.\r\nFinally, like the Tribunals, the Mechanism depends \r\non the cooperation of national Governments to arrest \r\nfugitives. The fact that nine Rwandan fugitives still \r\nremain at large 20 years after the genocide must be \r\naddressed. Three of them are earmarked for trial by \r\nthe Mechanism: Félicien Kabuga, the alleged chief \r\nfinancier of the genocide; Protais Mpiranya, the former \r\nCommander of the Presidential Guard; and Augustin \r\nBizimana, the former Defence Minister. As States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, we are all obliged to \r\ncooperate unconditionally and to comply with requests \r\nfor assistance or orders from the Mechanism. We \r\nstrongly encourage all States to intensify their efforts \r\nto ensure the arrest of the remaining fugitives.\r\nMr. Milanović (Serbia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to welcome Judge Theodor Meron, President of \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals, and Judge Vagn \r\nJoensen, President of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). I thank them for their \r\npresentations of the annual reports of the two Tribunals \r\n(see A/69/225 and A/69/206), as well as of the second \r\nannual report of the International Residual Mechanism \r\n(see A/69/226).\r\nLet me begin by expressing my country’s \r\nappreciation of the acknowledgement by the ICTY \r\nPresident of the continued high level of cooperation of \r\n10/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nthe Republic of Serbia. Serbia has made an important \r\ncontribution to making the ICTY more efficient than \r\nmost of the other international criminal tribunals, not \r\nonly by apprehending the last remaining fugitives, but \r\nalso by diligently providing documents to the Tribunal \r\nand enabling witnesses to testify. As a consequence, no \r\nindictees remain at large and most of the 3,458 requests \r\nfor assistance received from the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nor defence counsels for access to documents, archives \r\nand witnesses have been complied with, and only those \r\nof a more recent date are still being processed. That has \r\nbeen brought about not only by the compliance of the \r\nGovernment of Serbia with its international obligations, \r\nbut also by its firm commitment to the principles \r\nof international humanitarian law. Let me reiterate \r\nthat the Government of my country is committed to \r\ncontinuing such cooperation with both the Tribunal and \r\nthe Residual Mechanism.\r\nSerbia welcomes the progress made in the \r\nestablishment of operational capacities of the branch \r\nof the International Residual Mechanism in The Hague \r\nover the last year. The successful commencement of \r\nthe work of the Mechanism is of key importance for \r\nthe implementation of the ICTY mission in accordance \r\nwith its mandate and, in particular, for enabling national \r\njudiciaries to continue to prosecute war crimes. In \r\nthat context, I would like to mention with particular \r\nappreciation the visit to Belgrade of the Mechanism’s \r\nProsecutor, Hassan Bubakar Jallow, on 8 September, \r\nduring which a memorandum of understanding was \r\nsigned that will facilitate continued cooperation in the \r\nexchange of evidence to be used in cases tried by the \r\nnational judiciary of Serbia.\r\nSerbia systematically and persistently continues to \r\ninvestigate and indict those suspected of war crimes \r\ncommitted in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. So \r\nfar, Serbian courts have tried 435 persons for criminal \r\noffences committed in violation of international \r\nhumanitarian law, while 73 persons are currently under \r\ninvestigation. We thus expect the other countries of the \r\nformer Yugoslavia to do the same and try the cases of \r\nwar crimes in which Serbs were victims. That is their \r\nduty not only towards the victims and their own people, \r\nbut towards humanity as well.\r\nSerbia has followed with particular attention ICTY \r\nactivities to implement the completion strategy and \r\nfacilitate a smooth transition to the Mechanism. It is in \r\nthe interest of my country to see the processes against \r\nits citizens completed and to have their defences \r\npresented under a fair and expeditious procedure, \r\nbecause protracted procedures prolong detention, often \r\nindefinitely, and that is contrary to the recognized \r\nnorms regulating the rights of the accused. The case of \r\nVojislav Šešelj is indicative in that connection. Even 11 \r\nyears and 8 months after his voluntary surrender and \r\ndetention in the United Nations Detention Unit, he has \r\nnot yet been sentenced. It is therefore necessary that the \r\nICTY complete the pending cases as soon as possible \r\nwith full respect for the trial rights of the accused and \r\nthe defence.\r\nRegarding the ICTY legacy, the 21-year history \r\nof the work of the Tribunal has not, regrettably, \r\nbeen without inconsistencies. The practice has not \r\ncontributed to the strengthening of the rule of law or \r\nof legal security, nor has it helped the acceptance of the \r\nlegacy across the post-conflict societies of the former \r\nYugoslavia. It does not serve the interests of either the \r\naccused or the victims.\r\nIt has been demonstrated very clearly that, short of \r\nfull cooperation by the countries on whose territories \r\nthe crimes were committed, justice can hardly be \r\nserved. Regional cooperation, especially in the coming \r\nyears when the ICTY has ceased its activity, will be \r\nof key importance in the struggle against impunity \r\nfor international criminal offences. Such cooperation \r\nwith the war crimes prosecutors of Croatia, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Montenegro and the European Union \r\nRule of Law Mission in Kosovo has been constantly \r\nintensifying, with evidence being exchanged in 252 \r\ncases so far. Let me point out in that regard that the \r\nwar crimes prosecutors of Serbia and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina signed an agreement on 11 September on \r\nthe exchange of liaison officers to facilitate bilateral \r\ncooperation on access to evidence.\r\nFor its part, my country honours its obligations \r\nand will continue to cooperate in good faith, in the \r\nfirm belief that justice is both a goal and a means of \r\nfacing the past and addressing the common future. \r\nThe international judicial system, however, has its \r\nown contribution to make through full respect for \r\ninternational norms, human rights and the right to a fair \r\nhearing and defence. \r\nIn that context, let me reiterate Serbia’s readiness \r\nto address, and its interest in addressing, the question \r\nof the ICTY archives. We advised the Security Council \r\nof our official position on the matter in October 2008. \r\nWe are also ready to continue the discussion on the \r\nissue of information centres.\r\n14-56573 11/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nAs I pointed out here last year, as well as in the \r\ndebates in the Security Council, Serbia attaches great \r\nimportance to the initiative of allowing those sentenced \r\nby the ICTY to serve their sentences in the States that \r\nemerged in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. My \r\ncountry has shown its readiness to accept its nationals, \r\nas well as other willing persons tried by the ICTY, \r\nincluding those yet to be tried by the Mechanism, and \r\nis ready to provide full security guarantees regarding \r\nthe locations in which those sentences would be served.\r\nToday, Serbian nationals are serving prison \r\nsentences in Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, \r\nFrance, Germany, Norway, Poland, Portugal and \r\nSweden. Our request that sentences be allowed to be \r\nserved in Serbia is motivated by the desire to overcome \r\nthe difficulties that the sentences encounter in foreign \r\nprisons, particularly difficulties related to the exercise \r\nof human rights. My country has promoted the initiative \r\nvery actively and since 2009 has sought to sign a sentence \r\nenforcement agreement with the ICTY. Its officials \r\nhave written to the United Nations and the ICTY on \r\nthe matter on a number of occasions, but, regrettably, \r\nto no avail. The Government of Serbia considers that \r\nno legal or political reasons exist today - more than \r\ntwo decades later - for the continued implementation \r\nof the Secretary-General’s 1993 recommendation that \r\nprovides for the enforcement of sentences outside the \r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia.\r\nWithout prejudging the recommendation of the \r\nSecretary-General, and in view of the statement in \r\nthe report of the Mechanism to the General Assembly \r\nbeing discussed today that “The Mechanism is grateful \r\nto those Member States that are enforcing sentences \r\nand to those that are willing to consider concluding \r\nsentence enforcement agreements” (see A/69/226, para. \r\n68), and in respect of President Meron’s statement in his \r\nbriefing to the Security Council in June 2013 that the \r\nMechanism was actively working to secure additional \r\nagreements to increase its enforcement capacity and \r\nwelcomed the cooperation of States in that regard, \r\nSerbia would appreciate the opportunity to sign a \r\nsentence enforcement agreement with the Mechanism.\r\nLet me repeat that the results of long-standing \r\ncooperation with the ICTY testify to my country’s \r\nseriousness and readiness to accept international \r\nsupervision of enforcement and to provide all necessary \r\nguarantees. We also consider that other States in the \r\nterritory of the former Yugoslavia should be enabled to \r\nconclude such agreements with the Mechanism, if they \r\nso wish and if they fulfil the necessary conditions. In \r\nthat context, I would like to point out that on 20 January \r\n2011 Serbia signed the agreement on the enforcement \r\nof criminal sentences with the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Under the provisions of the agreement, the \r\npersons convicted before the Court for war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and genocide may serve their \r\nsentences in Serbia.\r\nI wish to conclude by saying that by fulfilling its \r\nobligations with respect to its cooperation with the ICTY, \r\nas well as by trying war crimes in domestic courts to the \r\nhighest professional standards, the Republic of Serbia \r\nhas made a significant contribution to the Tribunal’s \r\ncompletion strategy and to the process of normalization \r\nof relations among countries of the region. All results \r\nof my country’s years of cooperation with the Tribunal \r\nindicate the seriousness of the Republic of Serbia and \r\nits readiness to contribute to the cause of international \r\njustice.\r\nMrs. Anđelić (Bosnia and Herzegovina): I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for transmitting the \r\ntwenty-first annual report of the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) (see A/69/225), the \r\nsecond annual report of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals (see A/69/226) \r\nand the nineteenth annual report of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTY) (see A/69/206) \r\nto the Security Council and to the General Assembly. \r\nLet me underline the significant contribution of all the \r\nstaff of the Tribunals and to thank them for all their \r\nefforts and commitment to successfully completing \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the \r\nestablishment of the ICTY and has supported its \r\nwork since the beginning, because the ICTY is a \r\nlegal framework for fighting impunity, which ensures \r\naccountability for the worst of crimes and an end to a \r\ntragic period in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nand the region. For a long time the ICTY has been the \r\nonly hope for victims of mass murders, deportations, \r\ntorture, rape and other inhuman acts. The ICTY has \r\nsent a clear message that the crimes committed in the \r\nformer Yugoslavia should be punished consistently and \r\nwithout exceptions. That should be a clear warning \r\nto mass murderers of the future and a support to the \r\nprocess of reconciliation in the region.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has consistently \r\ncooperated with the ICTY, and we will continue \r\nthat cooperation in the future in order to give to the \r\n12/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nResidual Mechanism assistance, as necessary. Our \r\nauthorities continue to provide valuable assistance, \r\nallowing access to documents and archives and in the \r\nfield of witness protection. It is of high importance that \r\nthe Tribunal’s completion strategy and its transition to \r\nthe Residual Mechanism be successfully implemented. \r\nIn that regard, Bosnia and Herzegovina is committed to \r\nprovide support to the Mechanism in doing all necessary \r\nadministrative and judicial work. We welcome that the \r\nMechanism’s staff includes nationals of 46 Sates, also \r\nincluding nationals of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\r\nThe Tribunals have had a positive influence on \r\nthe judiciary and in terms of respect for the rule of \r\nlaw in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which continues to \r\nstrengthen national justice systems at all levels in \r\norder to bring more war criminals to justice in local \r\ncourts. We adopted the national war crimes strategy on \r\n29 December 2008. The implementation of the strategy \r\nis a complex process that includes the participation of \r\nmany institutions from all authority levels in Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina. We welcome the support of the \r\nEuropean Union in the implementation of the goals of \r\nthe strategy.\r\nRegional cooperation remains essential for the \r\nprosecution of all suspected war criminals and for \r\nrebuilding trust in the region. It is a precondition for \r\nthe process of reconciliation. Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\ncontinues to promote regional cooperation, most \r\nrecently by signing with Montenegro the protocol on \r\ncooperation in prosecution of perpetrators of war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and genocide, on 26 April. \r\nThat followed the signing of protocols on the exchange \r\nof evidence and information on war crimes, concluded \r\nbetween the Office of the Prosecutor of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina and the Office of the Prosecutor of Serbia \r\nin January 2013 and with the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nof Croatia in June 2013. The protocols defined the \r\nchannels for concluding any investigations concerning \r\ncitizens of other countries.\r\nBoth the ICTY and ICTR have contributed to \r\nclassifying sexual abuse as a crime against humanity, \r\nand as such, the issue of sexual abuse has become an \r\nintegral part of the Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Women judges and women in senior positions in \r\nthe Offices of the Prosecutors have made significant \r\ncontributions to the effective prosecution of cases of \r\nsexual violence against women. In that respect, we \r\nwelcome that 56 per cent of professional staff and 53 per \r\ncent of all Mechanism staff are female. Furthermore, \r\nwe welcome the assistance of UN-Women, which \r\nsponsored a programme about prosecuting crimes of \r\nsexual violence.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that both \r\nTribunals have made considerable achievements and \r\nprogress in prosecuting individuals who bear the greatest \r\nresponsibility for serious human rights violations \r\nand violations of humanitarian law. Furthermore, we \r\nwelcome the achievements reached in delivering justice \r\nto victims and in developing international criminal \r\nlaw. They have contributed significantly to fighting \r\nimpunity and to improving general understanding of \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The \r\nhistoric contributions of both Tribunals could serve to \r\ninspire other international and national jurisdictions, in \r\nparticular the International Criminal Court.\r\nMs. Rodríguez Pineda (Guatemala) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I would like to thank the President of \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), Judge Meron, for the annual reports \r\nof the ICTY (see A/69/225) and of the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (see \r\nA/69/226), and the President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), Judge Joensen, \r\nfor the annual report of the ICTR (see A/69/206). I wish \r\nto thank both for their excellent briefings and for their \r\npresentations of the reports, for which we are meeting \r\nin the Hall today.\r\nWith regard to the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda, we are pleased that the activities being \r\ncarried out in the appeals cases are expected to conclude \r\nbefore the end of the year, with the exception of one \r\ncase for which a final ruling is expected by August \r\n2015. In that spirit, we celebrate the fact that soon \r\n20 years will have passed since the Security Council \r\nestablished the Tribunal. We recognize its considerable \r\nachievements and the progress it has made in advancing \r\ninternational criminal law, ensuring justice for victims \r\nand strengthening national systems.\r\nAt the same time, much work remains to be done \r\nbefore the Tribunal can close its doors. In that regard, \r\nI refer in particular to the urgent situation of those \r\nacquitted or who have served their sentences while living \r\nin safe houses in Arusha. That should remain a priority, \r\nand the Security Council should support the Tribunal in \r\nits efforts to resolve the matter before it completes its \r\nmandate. That is an important humanitarian issue with \r\nsignificant consequences for the Security Council’s \r\ncredibility. We welcome the recent news that Belgium \r\n14-56573 13/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nhas responded to that call, and we urge other States to \r\nmake efforts to resolve that persistent problem.\r\nWith regard to State cooperation, it should be \r\nnoted that, although the transfer of cases to national \r\njurisdictions has facilitated the conclusion of the ICTR’s \r\nwork, that will only be achieved in reality when all of \r\nits fugitives have been arrested and brought to justice, \r\neither through the International Residual Mechanism or \r\nin national courts. We trust that Member States will \r\nremain united in that common effort.\r\nWe congratulate the members of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for their \r\ndetermination and for having adopted measures to \r\nmaximize the efficiency of their judicial proceedings, \r\nwhile maintaining the strictest levels of procedural \r\nfairness. The personal efforts of the President of the \r\nTribunal to prevent delays and to strengthen the \r\nAppeals Chamber are particularly noteworthy. We are \r\nalso pleased that the International Residual Mechanism \r\nis now functioning, and, in particular, that the Tribunals \r\nhave continued to smoothly transfer functions to the \r\nResidual Mechanism’s respective branches.\r\nThe establishment of the International Residual \r\nMechanism ensures that the closure of both Tribunals \r\nwill not leave the door open to future impunity for the \r\nremaining fugitives or jeopardize the trials and appeals \r\nthat have not yet been concluded. Guatemala believes \r\nthat the International Residual Mechanism is exemplary \r\nin that it strikes a balance between two potentially \r\nconflicting requirements: on one hand, the need to \r\nrespect due process and justice and, on the other hand, \r\nthe requirement of efficiency and cost effectiveness.\r\nThat brings me to my next point, which has to do \r\nwith cost-benefit estimates with regard to international \r\ntribunals. Some delegations have raised doubts about \r\nthe financial cost and time required to bring a relatively \r\nsmall number of perpetrators to justice. However, the \r\nadministration of justice cannot be measured in monetary \r\nterms alone. Indeed, the rule of law is priceless, and the \r\nimpact of the tribunals cannot be measured in terms of \r\nthe number of individuals prosecuted. One must also \r\ntake into account the tribunals’ deterrent effect and the \r\nfact that the entire international community now has \r\nmechanisms to ensure that justice prevails.\r\nWe listened carefully to the concerns raised by the \r\nPresidents of the Tribunals with regard to the conclusion \r\nof their respective mandates. We share those concerns, \r\nparticularly with regard to requests for extensions of \r\nthe mandates of the judges of both Tribunals, based \r\non the timetable for the conclusion of the work that \r\nthey have yet to carry out, the details of which were \r\nprovided in their respective reports. The judges also \r\nraised the serious issue of the increasing attrition rate \r\nof staff and staff reductions. Clearly, the retention of \r\ncompetent and experienced personnel remains essential \r\nfor the conclusion of the respective Tribunals’ work.\r\nIn that regard, we must be consistent. The Tribunals’ \r\ncapacity to successfully carry out their work must be \r\nproportional to their existing mandates and the resources \r\nallocated to them. Therefore, it is essential to support \r\nthe Tribunals so that they can independently carry out \r\nthe mandates that we have conferred upon them. The \r\nUnited Nations should not sacrifice international peace \r\nand security, accountability and the strengthening \r\nof the rule of law – all hard-won achievements – for \r\nbudgetary concerns.\r\nGiven the fact that one of the Tribunals will soon \r\nconclude its mandate and the other will conclude its \r\nmandate in the near future, it is timely for us to reflect \r\non the impact that the Tribunals have had, not only in \r\nterms of advancing the cause of international criminal \r\nlaw, but also with regard to the universal application \r\nof the purposes and principles of the Organization. We \r\nhope that further measures can be taken to preserve the \r\nlegacy of both Tribunals and to facilitate the transfer \r\nof the knowledge and experience gained to other \r\njurisdictions.\r\nFinally, we reaffirm our unconditional support \r\nfor the International Tribunals and the International \r\nResidual Mechanism, and urge all States to continue to \r\nprovide their support until the judicial process has been \r\ncompleted.\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): On behalf of my delegation, I \r\nthank you, Sir, for convening this very important debate. \r\nI also thank the Secretary-General for transmitting to \r\nus the report of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (see A/69/225) and the report \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (see \r\nA/69/206).\r\nThe subject under consideration today is closely \r\nconnected to discussions on the respect for the rule of \r\nlaw, which is enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and is also a fundamental element of both \r\nnational and international jurisprudence. I join those \r\nwho have taken the f loor before me to thank the \r\nPresident and Prosecutor of the International Residual \r\n14/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals, Judge Theodor \r\nMeron and Justice Hassan Bubacar Jallow, respectively, \r\nfor the report of the Mechanism (see A/69/226), which \r\nhas provided useful insights to guide our deliberations \r\ntoday.\r\nNigeria commends the two ad hoc Tribunals for \r\ntheir trailblazing contributions to the development of \r\nsubstantive and procedural international criminal law, \r\nand for their contributions to the promotion of the rule \r\nof law. Through their work, the international criminal \r\njustice system, the fight against impunity and the \r\nability to ensure accountability for genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity, as well as war crimes, have been \r\nstrengthened.\r\nIt will be recalled that at the Security Council \r\nbriefing on 16 April to commemorate the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the genocide in Rwanda (see S/PV.7155), \r\nthe Council adopted resolution 2150 (2014), which calls \r\nupon States to recommit themselves to preventing \r\ngenocide and other serious crimes under international \r\nlaw. The Council affirmed that the prosecution by the \r\nICTR of persons responsible for genocide and other \r\nserious international crimes has contributed to the \r\nprocess of national reconciliation and to the restoration \r\nand maintenance of peace in Rwanda. Against that \r\nbackdrop and in the interest of justice, all Member \r\nStates have a duty to cooperate with the ICTR, the \r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals and the Government of Rwanda in the \r\narrest and prosecution of the remaining nine indicted \r\nfugitives.\r\nAccording to the ICTR report, Member States \r\nhave intensified their cooperation with the objective of \r\napprehending and bringing to trial, within their national \r\njurisdictions, the Rwandan suspects appearing on the \r\nInterpol list of wanted fugitives. That is a welcome \r\ndevelopment, and we hope that it sends a clear message \r\nthat perpetrators of mass atrocity crimes will have no \r\nplace to hide.\r\nNigeria takes positive note of the progress made \r\nby the ICTR in implementing its completion strategy, \r\nwhich has been continuously updated since 2003. The \r\nsmooth handover of most judicial and prosecutorial \r\nfunctions to the International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals is an important indication \r\nof that progress. We note that the preparation and \r\nsubmission of archives to the Residual Mechanism \r\nare major challenges. Nevertheless, we call on the \r\nICTR to continue to devote attention to the process of \r\ntransferring those records and archives to the Residual \r\nMechanism. One immutable fact is that the lessons \r\nlearned in managing the judicial, administrative and \r\nprosecutorial functions of an international tribunal are \r\nvast, and sharing them will allow current and future \r\ninternational and domestic law practitioners to learn \r\nfrom the successes and challenges that form the legacy \r\nof the ICTR.\r\nConcerning the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia, it is significant that there are \r\nno more fugitives to be tried and that the Tribunal \r\nhas concluded proceedings against 141 of the 161 \r\nindividuals whom it has indicted. That reassures us that \r\nthe Tribunal has been making progress in completing \r\nits mandate to meet the deadlines of the completion \r\nstrategy. The Tribunal’s support to the Residual \r\nMechanism through a variety of processes, including \r\nrecruitment, communications, information technology \r\nsupport and registry management, is commendable.\r\nHowever, we are concerned that various factors, \r\nincluding the late arrests of certain individuals and \r\nissues that are particular to specific cases, could \r\nmilitate against the efforts to complete some trials and \r\nappeals by the deadline of 31 December 2014 and to \r\ntransfer them to the Residual Mechanism. The General \r\nAssembly will therefore have the duty to revisit the \r\nsubject of the extension of the ICTY judges’ terms at \r\nsome point before the end of this year. We encourage \r\nthe Tribunal to work expeditiously towards completing \r\nthe outstanding judicial proceedings, while observing \r\nall appropriate procedural safeguards, adhering to the \r\nfundamental principles of due process and fairness \r\nand ensuring a smooth transition to the Residual \r\nMechanism.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the assessment and \r\nprogress report of the President of the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, Judge \r\nTheodor Meron, for the period from 16 November \r\n2013 to 15 May 2014 (see S/2014/350). We are satisfied \r\nthat, in accordance with its mandate, the Residual \r\nMechanism has assumed responsibility for many of the \r\nfunctions of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia. We call on the Residual Mechanism \r\nto continue to work closely with the principals and staff \r\nof both Tribunals to ensure a smooth transition of the \r\nremaining functions and services, and a harmonization \r\nand adoption of best practices.\r\n14-56573 15/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nNigeria is committed to the fight against impunity. \r\nWe believe that impunity must be addressed resolutely \r\nwherever it occurs in the world, and we have instituted \r\nvarious instruments to address that practice. Our belief \r\nin the need for global action against mass atrocity \r\ncrimes and security threats to humankind underpins our \r\nratification of relevant international legal instruments.\r\nMs. Rambally (Saint Lucia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIt is also our belief that the aspiration for a global \r\nsystem based on the rule of law, where accountability \r\nand social justice are the foundations for a durable peace, \r\nshould be a source of inspiration to all. Indeed, that \r\nshould be a priority for the international community, \r\nfor world leaders and for citizens.\r\nMs. Hamilton (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States thanks Presidents Meron and Joensen for \r\ntheir reports on the work of the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, as well \r\nas for their tireless work in advancing global justice. \r\nReconciliation is not possible without accountability or \r\nwithout truth, and the work of the Presidents and the \r\nTribunals has gone far toward creating reconciliation \r\nand lasting peace.\r\nThis year, the world marked the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Rwandan genocide. In supporting the \r\ncreation and work of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda (ICTR), the international community came \r\ntogether to assist Rwanda in its recovery efforts. Today, \r\nthe work of the ICTR’s Trial Chamber is complete, and \r\nthe Tribunal continues to work hard to pass along its \r\nduties to national courts and to the Residual Mechanism. \r\nThis year, the Tribunal transferred one case to the \r\nRwandan courts for trial and sent a significant portion \r\nof its archives to the Residual Mechanism. By the end \r\nof this year, the Tribunal’s appeals work is scheduled \r\nto be completed in all but one case. The Tribunal has \r\nprepared a manual of best practices for the investigation \r\nand prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence, \r\nadding to its already substantial legacy. In that regard, \r\nthe world can continue its landmark work in prosecuting \r\nthose unspeakable crimes.\r\nThe work of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) is just as impressive. Only \r\nnine cases remain, and the Tribunal has worked hard \r\nto expedite those proceedings without sacrificing due \r\nprocess and the rights of the accused. President Meron \r\nwisely precluded delays by welcoming two additional \r\njudges to the Tribunal, thereby reducing the chance \r\nthat the judges’ workload might delay the conclusion \r\nof the proceedings. In addition to transferring some of \r\nits functions to the Residual Mechanism, the Tribunal \r\nhas provided information and expertise to national \r\ncourts in order to facilitate the domestic prosecutions \r\nof crimes committed during the wars in the former \r\nYugoslavia, so that the important work begun by the \r\nTribunal will continue after the Tribunal has completed \r\nits operations.\r\nThe United States also commends the continuing \r\nefforts of the Tribunals over the past several years \r\nto wind down their operations and transfer their \r\nremaining workload to the Residual Mechanism as \r\nthey progress ever closer to the completion of their \r\nhistoric work. The contribution of the ad hoc Tribunals \r\ncannot be overstated. They have made immeasurable \r\ncontributions to the development of international \r\nlaw in ensuring accountability for genocide, ranging \r\nfrom recognizing rape as a crime against humanity to \r\ncompiling data on how to prosecute war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity. \r\nIndeed, it is difficult to imagine modern \r\ninternational law today without the contributions of \r\nthe two International Criminal Tribunals. The very \r\nexistence of those Tribunals represents the commitment \r\nof the international community to keep moving forward, \r\nto keep improving our responses to atrocities, and to \r\nkeep evolving as the human race until such abominable \r\ncrimes are a relic of the past. The ad hoc Tribunals and \r\nthe work they have done have not only brought justice \r\nto communities torn asunder; they have brought us one \r\nstep closer to the day when we can look forward and say \r\nwith certainty, “never again”.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Our delegation would like to thank the Presidents \r\nof International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR) for presenting to the General Assembly \r\nthe annual reports on the activities of the Tribunals (see \r\nA/69/225 and A/69/206, respectively) as well as for the \r\nsecond report of the International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals (see A/69/226).\r\nWe closely follow the progress of the proceedings \r\nin the Tribunals and their adherence to the timetables \r\nfor the completion of their work, as established by \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1966 (2010). We expect that \r\n16/17 14-56573\r\nA/69/PV.24 13/10/2014\r\nthe leadership of the Tribunals will step up their efforts \r\nwith a view to accelerating the process as much as \r\npossible. Unfortunately, the reports have confirmed that \r\ndespite the work being carried out, the ICTY and ICTR \r\nare veering farther off track from those timetables. A \r\nnew delay of more than six months is expected in the \r\nICTY Simatović and Stanišić case. That postponement, \r\naccording to the report, is not due to some force \r\nmajeure but rather to organizational problems as well \r\nas an improper assessment of the case.\r\nThe appellate decision handed down in January by \r\nthe ICTY again accentuated problems of fundamental \r\nimportance for the international criminal justice system, \r\nsuch as ensuring legal certainty and applying common \r\nstandards of justice to all. We believe that upholding \r\nthose principles is crucial for the development of \r\ninternational criminal justice and for the legacy of the \r\nTribunals.\r\nWith regard to the ICTR, unfortunately, instead of \r\nthe expected early completion of the proceedings in the \r\nButare case, the report announces an additional delay, \r\neven if only of a month. We would like once again \r\nto caution leadership of the Tribunal against using \r\ntechnical issues to draw out its work. We are aware of \r\nthe seriousness of the problem of finding States suitable \r\nfor the resettlement of those who have served their \r\nsentences or been acquitted by the ICTR, as well as \r\nthe complexity of the task of tracking down fugitives. \r\nWe would nevertheless like to urge the leadership of \r\nthe ICTR to give priority to the main functions of the \r\nTribunal so that it may complete its work in the near \r\nfuture, within its allocated budget.\r\nWe call on the leadership of both Tribunals, as well \r\nas of the Residual Mechanism, to take all necessary \r\nmeasures to swiftly transfer to the Residual Mechanism \r\nthe functions that are not directly related to the \r\nproceedings. We expect in particular that the functions \r\nrelating to the resettlement of persons acquitted by the \r\nICTR in safe countries will be transferred before the \r\nend of this year.\r\nThe issues raised concerning the timely completion \r\nof the work of the Tribunals still need to be considered \r\nin detail by the Security Council, in accordance of \r\nthe provisions of its resolution 1966 (2010) and in the \r\ncontext of the issue of further extending the mandate of \r\nthe judges of the Tribunals.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to note that it is \r\nimportant that the Tribunals continue to carry out \r\nbilateral work with countries in the relevant regions, \r\nand such developments should be strongly encouraged. \r\nIn that regard, we support the transfer to Serbia of those \r\nunder its jurisdiction following the judgement of the \r\nTribunal.\r\nMrs. Byaje (Rwanda): I also wish to thank the \r\nPresidents of the International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda (ICTR) and the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals for having presented \r\ntheir respective reports (see A/69/225, A/69/206 and \r\nA/69/226).\r\nAllow me to recall at the outset that the examination \r\nof those reports by the General Assembly comes a few \r\nmonths after the commemoration of the 20 years since \r\nthe 1994 genocide against the Tutsis in Rwanda, but \r\nalso a few days before the twentieth anniversary of the \r\ncreation of ICTR through Security Council resolution \r\n955 (1994). My delegation commends the efforts of both \r\nTribunals to successfully complete their activities and \r\nto hand over the remaining activities to the Mechanism, \r\nin conformity with pertinent resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil. We take this opportunity to express our \r\nsatisfaction over the ICTR’s recent judgements in the \r\nthree cases concerning Édouard Karemera and Mathieu \r\nNgirumpatse, Ildéphonse Nizeyimana, and Callixte \r\nNzabonimana.\r\nWe particularly commend the Tribunals for their \r\ncontributions to international criminal justice, notably \r\nthrough the fight against impunity for genocide and \r\nother heinous crimes against humanity and through \r\na rich jurisprudence that will continue to serve \r\ninternational criminal justice. We take this opportunity \r\nto recall our strong request, backed by all five States of \r\nthe East African Community, that the archives of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda be hosted \r\nby Rwanda, in order to bridge the distance between \r\nICTR’s justice and the victims of genocide.\r\nIn relation to the report of the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, we note \r\nwith satisfaction that both the Arusha branch and the \r\nbranch located in The Hague are fully operational, \r\nand we appreciate the commendable support from the \r\nPresidents and key staff of the ICTY and the ICTR. \r\nHowever, we are deeply concerned at the fact that no \r\ntangible progress has been registered in the tracking \r\nof the remaining genocide fugitives indicted by the \r\nICTR, notably the three key genocide suspects Félicien \r\nKabuga, Augustin Bizimana and Protais Mpiranya.\r\n14-56573 17/17\r\n13/10/2014 A/69/PV.24\r\nWe therefore take this opportunity to recall the key \r\nprovision of Security Council resolution 2150 (2014), \r\nwhich in its paragraph 3 calls upon Member States\r\n“to cooperate with the ICTR, the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals \r\nand the Government of Rwanda in the arrest \r\nand prosecution of the remaining nine ICTR-\r\nindicted fugitives, and further calls upon States \r\nto investigate, arrest, prosecute or extradite, \r\nin accordance with applicable international \r\nobligations, all other fugitives accused of genocide \r\nresiding on their territories, including those who \r\nare FDLR leaders”.\r\nI must also deplore the controversial acquittals by \r\nthe Appeals Chamber of the ICTR. Such a stand with \r\nregard to the justice system is a matter of great concern \r\nand can only contribute to reversing the healing process \r\nfor survivors struggling to gain a sense of closure.\r\nIn relation to the monitoring of ICTR cases referred \r\nto national jurisdictions, under rule 11 bis of the \r\nICTR statutes, it is worth highlighting the following \r\npoint. While the Uwinkindi and Munyagishari cases, \r\nwhich were transferred to Rwanda in April 2012 and \r\nJuly 2013, respectively, are under trial and pretrial \r\nproceedings before Rwandan courts, the Bucyibaruta \r\nand Munyeshyaka cases, which were transferred to \r\nFrance in November 2007, are scheduled to be tried \r\nby French courts in 2015 and 2016. We are therefore \r\nextremely concerned by the inconceivable delay in \r\nthe proceedings in the cases referred by the ICTR to \r\nFrance. In that respect, we recall the saying that “justice \r\ndelayed is justice denied”.\r\nAs the ICTR and ICTY have clearly established \r\nthat genocide had been committed in Rwanda and in \r\nSrebrenica, respectively, we hereby reiterate our call on \r\nall, including political actors, to fight against the scourge \r\nof genocide denial, which is an insult to the victims and \r\nan obstruction to sustainable reconciliation. The fight \r\nagainst genocide denial includes, among other things, \r\nrefraining from the use of terminologies conveying \r\nmixed messages, such as “the Rwandan genocide”, \r\nwhich gives a pretext to revisionists of all kinds, as \r\nwell as to some scholars from Western countries, to \r\nmislead the general public by stating that the genocide \r\nthat occurred in Rwanda was perpetrated against a \r\nnational group, Rwandans, killing each other. We call \r\non each and every one to redress the situation and use \r\nthe terminology established by the ICTR in the Akayesu \r\ncase, and referred to in paragraph 1 of Security Council \r\nresolution 2150 (2014), namely, “genocide against the \r\nTutsi in Rwanda, during which Hutu and others who \r\nopposed the genocide were also killed”.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that while we \r\ncommend the work of the ICTY and the ICTR, we \r\nalso urge them to deploy every effort to successfully \r\nachieve their mandates, in conformity with pertinent \r\nresolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on the agenda items before us.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to take note of the nineteenth annual report \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (see \r\nA/69/206)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I also take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the Assembly to take note of the twenty-\r\nfirst annual report of the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (see A/69/225)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to take note of the second annual \r\nreport of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals (see A/69/226)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 71, 72 and 127?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.55 p.m.\r\n"
