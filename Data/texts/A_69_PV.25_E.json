Those five States \r\ncannot be re-elected. Their names therefore should not \r\nappear on the ballot papers.\r\nApart from the five permanent members, the \r\nSecurity Council will include in the year 2015 the \r\nfollowing States: Chad, Chile, Jordan, Lithuania and \r\nNigeria. The names of those States therefore should \r\nalso not appear on the ballot papers.\r\nOf the five non-permanent members that will \r\nremain in office in the year 2015, three are from Africa \r\nand the Asia-Pacific region, one is from Eastern Europe \r\nand one is from Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\nConsequently, pursuant to paragraph 3 of resolution \r\n1991 A (XVIII), of 17 December 1963, the five \r\nnon-permanent members should be elected according \r\nto the following pattern: two from the African and \r\nAsia-Pacific States, one from the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States and two from the Western European \r\nand Other States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nIn accordance with established practice, there is \r\nan understanding to the effect that, of the two States \r\nto be elected from among the African and Asia-Pacific \r\nStates, one should be from Africa and one should be \r\nfrom the Asia-Pacific region.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates - their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled - receiving the greatest number \r\nof votes and a two-thirds majority of those present \r\nand voting will be declared elected. If the number of \r\ncandidates obtaining a two-thirds majority is less than \r\nthe number of members to be elected, there shall be \r\nadditional ballots to fill the remaining places, the voting \r\nbeing restricted to the candidates obtaining the greatest \r\nnumber of votes in the previous ballot to a number not \r\nmore than twice the places remaining to be filled.\r\nAlso, consistent with past practice, in case a tie vote \r\nshould make it necessary to determine the candidate \r\nto be elected or that will proceed to the next round of \r\nrestricted balloting, there will be a special restricted \r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthose procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot and there shall be no nominations.\r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.25\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n25th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 16 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/4 14-57173\r\nA/69/PV.25 16/10/2014\r\nRegarding candidatures, I have been informed by \r\nthe Chairpersons of the respective regional groups of \r\nthe following. For the two vacant seats from among the \r\nAfrican and Asia-Pacific States, there are two endorsed \r\ncandidates, namely, Angola and Malaysia. For the \r\none vacant seat from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, there is one endorsed candidate, \r\nnamely, the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. For the \r\ntwo vacant seats from among the Western European \r\nand Other States, there are three candidates, namely, \r\nNew Zealand, Spain and Turkey.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nwe shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection. Please be reminded that during the voting \r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. That means in particular that once \r\nthe meeting has begun, no campaign materials can be \r\ndistributed inside the Hall. All participants are also \r\nrequested to remain in their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank them \r\nfor their cooperation.\r\nI should also like to remind members of the press \r\nnot to focus their cameras on delegations during the \r\nvoting process, taking into account that this is a secret \r\nballot, in accordance with the rules of procedure of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I thank them for their cooperation.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s nameplate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B” and “C” will now be \r\ndistributed. I request representatives to use only those \r\nballot papers that have been distributed. If there are \r\nothers, I ask that they not be used.\r\nMay I ask representatives to write on the ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, for the African and Asia-Pacific \r\nStates, the names of the two States for which they wish \r\nto vote; on the ballot papers marked “B”, for the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, the name of the one \r\nState for which they wish to vote; and on the ballot \r\npapers marked “C”, for the Western European and \r\nOther States, the names of the two States for which they \r\nwish to vote.\r\nA ballot will be declared invalid if it contains more \r\nnames of Member States from the relevant region than \r\nthe number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also be \r\ndeclared invalid if all the names of the Member States \r\non that ballot do not belong to the relevant region. If \r\na ballot paper of a region includes both the names of \r\nMember States that belong to and that do not belong to \r\nthat region, the ballot remains valid, but only the names \r\nof the Member States that belong to the relevant region \r\nwill be counted. The names of Member States that do \r\nnot belong to that region will not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Chan (Costa Rica), \r\nMs. Abrahamsen (Finland), Ms. Reich (Hungary), \r\nMr. Kurer (Libya), Ms. Bidaoui (Netherlands) and \r\nMs. Thanarat (Thailand) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.40 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.35 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African and Asian-Pacific States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  128\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAngola  190\r\nMalaysia  187\r\nCongo  1\r\nGroup B — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  1\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:  10\r\nNumber of members voting:  182\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  181\r\nBrazil  1\r\n14-57173 3/4\r\n16/10/2014 A/69/PV.25\r\nGroup C — Western European and Other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members voting:  193\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  129\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nNew Zealand  145\r\nSpain  131\r\nTurkey  109\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority \r\nand the largest number of votes, Angola, Malaysia, \r\nNew Zealand and the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela were elected members of the Security \r\nCouncil for a two-year term beginning on 1 January \r\n2015.\r\nThe President: One seat from among the Western \r\nEuropean and Other States remains.
