"*1457494*\r\n14-57494 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 62 and 12\r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development: progress \r\nin implementation and international support\r\n(a) New Partnership for Africa’s Development: \r\nprogress in implementation and \r\ninternational support\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/69/161 \r\nand A/69/163)\r\n(b) Causes of conflict and the promotion of durable \r\npeace and sustainable development in Africa\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/69/162)\r\n2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa\r\nThe President: Today’s joint debate offers us \r\na unique opportunity to share views on issues of \r\nimportance to the African continent, while taking stock \r\nof the progress made and challenges ahead.\r\nDuring the high-level panel discussion on the theme \r\n“The Africa we want”, which launched the Africa-New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) week \r\non 13 October, some thoughts on the state of Africa \r\nand its future were shared. The important role the \r\ninternational community can play towards the Africa \r\nof the future was also highlighted.\r\nWhen Africa celebrated 50 years since the founding \r\nof the Organization of African Unity and the African \r\nUnion, in May of the past year, it reaffirmed the \r\ncontinent’s commitment to the African Renaissance. \r\nIt also set out to develop the Agenda 2063 Vision, as \r\na new 50-year socioeconomic development vision \r\nthat seeks to establish an integrated, prosperous and \r\npeaceful continent. I am confident in saying that Africa \r\nis rising and Africa is ready to deliver on its promise. \r\nThe international community has played a crucial role \r\nin supporting Africa’s growth and development, and \r\nthat partnership remains of critical importance.\r\nThrough NEPAD, Africa established a coordinated \r\nsocioeconomic framework for its development. As \r\nnoted in the Secretary-General’s report, important \r\nprogress has been made in the overall implementation \r\nof NEPAD in several key sectors.\r\nInfrastructure development is an area that will \r\nfacilitate the diversification of African economies \r\nand unleash their full productive capacity. With the \r\nadoption of NEPAD’s Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa (PIDA) in July 2012, African \r\nleaders laid a foundation for the development of \r\ncritical regional and continental infrastructure. \r\nAfrica needs hydropower stations and transmission \r\nlines to facilitate production. It needs roads, railways \r\nand ports to facilitate commerce and trade. It needs \r\ncore information and communication technology \r\ninfrastructure to support trade in goods and services, \r\nas well as governance structures.\r\nThe efforts made under NEPAD in coordinating \r\nthe development of infrastructure across the continent \r\nthrough PIDA’s priority action are commendable. \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.26\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 17 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n2/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nOver the last 12 months, of the 51 projects and \r\nprogrammes envisioned, 16 national and regional \r\nprojects were identified as quick wins for financing \r\nand implementation. Those projects were subsequently \r\nshowcased at the Dakar Financing Summit for Africa’s \r\nInfrastructure, held in June.\r\nGrowth in the agricultural sector has long been \r\nidentified as a key area of focus in the development \r\ntransformation of African countries. It is important that \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme continue to receive attention as a guiding \r\nframework for the development of that sector.\r\nThose projects and others will require enormous \r\namounts of resources, but financing by Governments \r\nalone is not enough. Other sources of funding, especially \r\nfrom the private sector, including specialized funds, \r\nshould be tapped. The Presidential Infrastructure \r\nChampion Initiative, adopted to prioritize and fast-track \r\nthe implementation of key regional projects, is a step in \r\nthe right direction. Strengthened bilateral and regional \r\ncooperation to develop joint cross-border projects will \r\nalso be important going forward.\r\nImproving access to sustainable sources of clean, \r\nreliable and affordable energy will also be crucial to \r\nAfrica’s economic and social development. The United \r\nNations Sustainable Energy for All initiative, which \r\naims to ensure universal energy access by 2030, has \r\nhighlighted the importance of access to electricity.\r\nMalaria remains one of the most serious health \r\nproblems facing the world today. According to the \r\nWorld Health Organization, 80 per cent of the estimated \r\n207 million malaria cases worldwide in 2012 were \r\nin Africa. Malaria is endemic, especially in tropical \r\nAfrica, with an estimated 90 per cent of the total \r\nmalaria incidence and deaths occurring there. Pregnant \r\nwomen and children are especially at risk.\r\nSince 2000, when the General Assembly adopted \r\nthe first resolution on malaria (resolution 55/284), the \r\nworld has witnessed significant political commitment \r\nto the fight against the disease. We should all be proud \r\nof the fact that, just 10 years after the adoption of the \r\nresolution, more than 1.1 million deaths from malaria \r\nwere averted.\r\nOur success should not lead us to complacency. \r\nWe should redouble our efforts on malaria and strive to \r\nreach our ultimate goal of its total eradication. We must \r\npress on with conviction and the determination that this \r\npreventable and treatable disease can be eradicated in \r\nour lifetime.\r\nMr. Msosa (Malawi): It is my singular honour \r\nand pleasure to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States.\r\nThis debate marks the successful culmination \r\nof the 2014 Africa-New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) week, which has truly raised \r\nNEPAD’s profile here at the United Nations at a very \r\ncritical juncture, when Member States are preparing to \r\nundertake the important task of formulating the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nThe African States are truly exulted to see you, \r\nMr. President, presiding over these momentous \r\ndeliberations.\r\nWe are indeed grateful to the Secretary-General \r\nfor his reports on the items under discussion today \r\n(A/69/161, A/69/162 and A/69/163) and for his continued \r\nleadership and commitment in placing Africa’s agenda \r\nat the heart of the United Nations system. We fully \r\nacknowledge and can proudly attest to the United \r\nNations invaluable partnership with, and support to, \r\nAfrica and its endeavours, which will undoubtedly \r\ngrow stronger in the years to come.\r\nThe Group would also like to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Ibrahim Assane Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer \r\nof the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency, \r\nwhose visionary leadership is most commendable. We \r\nassociate ourselves fully with the statement he will \r\nmake on behalf of the Agency.\r\nThe year 2014 is truly special for Africa and the \r\nworld. In this celebrated year we have witnessed the \r\nfulfilment of the Rio+20 mandates related to the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthe meetings of the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing, \r\nthe convening of the High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development under the auspices of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the convening of \r\nthe first-ever United Nations Environment Assembly. \r\nAfrica was engaged in all of those processes and will \r\ngladly engage in the impending task of integrating \r\nthe inputs in the post-2015 development agenda, and \r\nultimately in their implementation.\r\nIn that regard, the African Group fully endorses \r\nand applauds the President’s choice of the theme of the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, namely, \r\n14-57494 3/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\n“Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda”.\r\nIn January, African Heads of State and Government \r\nendorsed the Common African Position (CAP) on \r\nthe Post-2015 Development Agenda, which identifies \r\nsubstantive issues of importance to the continent \r\nand arrives at a consensus on Africa’s key priorities, \r\nconcerns and strategies to be reflected in the outcomes \r\nof the post-2015 negotiation process. Guided by the \r\nCAP, Africa will contribute to the discussions on how \r\nto address the unfinished business of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), with a focus on the \r\neradication of poverty in all its forms and achieving \r\nthe African Union vision of an integrated, prosperous, \r\nstable and peaceful Africa, driven by its own citizens \r\nand representing a dynamic force in the global arena.\r\nThe launching of the CAP coincided with the \r\nformulation of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 Vision, \r\nan approach to how the continent should effectively learn \r\nfrom the lessons of the past, build upon the progress \r\nnow under way and strategically exploit all possible \r\nopportunities available in the immediate and medium \r\nterm, with a view to ensuring positive socioeconomic \r\ntransformation within the next five decades. We count \r\non the United Nations and other partners to support \r\nthe realization of Africa’s aspirations, especially the \r\nimplementation of the African Union-NEPAD agenda.\r\nIn the light of the multitude of challenges \r\nconfronting the continent, African Heads of State and \r\nGovernment adopted NEPAD as Africa’s vision and \r\nstrategic framework for political and socioeconomic \r\ntransformation in priority areas, including agriculture \r\nand food security, climate change and natural \r\nresource management, and regional integration and \r\ninfrastructure. More than two decades later, NEPAD \r\nremains committed to facilitating and implementing \r\nAfrica’s priority programmes and to consolidating \r\nthe positive steps already taken towards continental \r\ntransformation.\r\nThe African Group notes with great satisfaction \r\nthat agriculture remains at the centre of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment agenda. Agriculture makes up a \r\nsignificant portion of the economies of all African \r\ncountries and has the potential to contribute towards \r\nmajor continental priorities, including the eradication \r\nof poverty and hunger, boosting intra-Africa trade and \r\ninvestment, accelerating industrialization and economic \r\ndiversification, sustainable resource and environmental \r\nmanagement, creating jobs for thousands of youth and \r\nimproving livelihoods.\r\nDuring the sixty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly, we welcomed and celebrated the tenth \r\nanniversary of the implementation of the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Programme (CAADP). This year, at \r\nthe climax of the commemoration of the Africa Year \r\nof Agriculture 2014, we celebrated the rekindling \r\nof CAADP through the adoption of the Malabo \r\nDeclaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and \r\nTransformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved \r\nLivelihoods by the Assembly of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the African Union at its twenty-third \r\nordinary session. held in June in Equatorial Guinea. \r\nThe main thrust of the Declaration is the \r\nundertaking by African Governments to sustain the \r\nmomentum of CAADP for the next decade through \r\nincreasing financial investment in agriculture, \r\nincluding through mobilization of domestic resources \r\nand allocation of 10 per cent of public expenditure to \r\nthe sector; ending hunger by 2025; halving poverty by \r\nthe year 2025 through inclusive agricultural growth; \r\nensuring a 6 per cent growth in the sector per annum; \r\nboosting intra-Africa trade; enhancing resilience and \r\nreducing climate vulnerability; and fostering mutual \r\naccountability. We wish to underscore the importance \r\nof partnerships and international cooperation in \r\nattaining CAADP’s objectives.\r\nInfrastructure development remains a key priority \r\nfor Africa, and NEPAD is playing a pivotal role through \r\nthe implementation of the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa (PIDA). We duly note the \r\nefforts undertaken since October 2013, including to \r\nsecure funds to implement 16 infrastructure pilot \r\nprojects identified as quick wins for financing and \r\nimplementation. We welcome the Dakar Financing \r\nSummit held in June 2014, which adopted the Dakar \r\nAgenda for Action to finance those infrastructure pilot \r\nprojects. We note the major hurdles in financing the \r\nimplementation of PIDA projects and therefore call for \r\nthe mobilization of resources from all sources, both \r\npublic and private.\r\nOver a decade ago, African Heads of State and \r\nGovernment established the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism, NEPAD’s f lagship governance programme, \r\nwhich aims at promoting good governance across \r\nthe continent. Through the CAP, African countries \r\nhave resolved to adopt additional measures to fight \r\n4/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\ncorruption, promote good political and socioeconomic \r\ngovernance, transparency and accountability, especially \r\nin the field of natural resources management, and to \r\nincrease the involvement of civil society. We welcome \r\nthe enrolment of Equatorial Guinea in the Mechanism, \r\nwhich brings the number of volunteering African States \r\nto 34. We note with concern the slow pace in terms of \r\nreviewing members States and would encourage the \r\nAgency to seek ways of addressing the causal factors of \r\nsuch delays, including financial constraints.\r\nThe African Group thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report entitled “Causes of conflict \r\nand the promotion of durable peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Africa” (A/69/162). We acknowledge \r\nthe inextricable links between development and \r\npeace, security and stability. Through the CAP, we \r\nhave reaffirmed that peace and security are essential \r\nin achieving the continent’s development aspirations, \r\nespecially for ravaged countries or those emerging from \r\nconflict. In that regard, we are committed to addressing \r\nthe root causes of conflict and preventing the outbreak \r\nof armed conflict, including through the African Peace \r\nand Security Architecture.\r\nMalaria remains a serious health concern for Africa. \r\nIt is undoubtedly among the issues that will require our \r\ncontinued attention beyond the implementation of the \r\nMDGs. It is utterly unacceptable that the disease, which \r\nis entirely preventable and treatable, should continue \r\nto kill thousands of people, especially children, in our \r\ncontinent. We welcome the continued commitment of \r\nthe international community to eradicating malaria \r\nand other diseases, as underlined in the proposals of \r\nthe Open Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals.\r\nWe also welcome the declaration of the 2013 \r\nSpecial Summit of the African Union on HIV/AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria, which reaffirmed the \r\ncommitment of African Governments to accelerate \r\nthe implementation of existing frameworks, including \r\nthe Abuja Declaration and Plan of Action on Roll \r\nBack Malaria in Africa. We note with great concern \r\nthat the level of funding to fight malaria is far below \r\nthe resources required to achieve universal coverage \r\nthrough interventions. We therefore call upon \r\ndeveloped countries and other partners to fulfil all of \r\nthe commitments made towards eradication of that \r\nscourge.\r\nThe current Ebola outbreak in West Africa speaks \r\nto the urgency of internationally concerted action to \r\nhelp African countries improve their health systems \r\nand build core capacity to enhance access to water, \r\nsanitation and health services. The African Group \r\nbelieves that the Ebola outbreak is another wake-up call \r\nand that business as usual should not prevail again as we \r\nformulate the set of goals to guide global development \r\naction for many years to come. The needs of the most \r\nvulnerable must get due attention and be the subject \r\nof adequate means of implementation in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda in a manner that is commensurate \r\nwith the huge challenges. \r\nAllow me to commend the emergency actions \r\ntaken by the Secretary-General and the decisions by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to establish \r\nthe United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency \r\nResponse to stem the spread of the outbreak, treat the \r\ninfected, provide essential services, preserve stability \r\nand prevent outbreaks in non-affected countries.\r\nLet me conclude by underscoring further the \r\nimportance of fulfilling the commitments made to \r\nAfrica, including relating to official development \r\nassistance. In the light of the multitude of challenges \r\nfacing the continent, Member States, via the \r\nRio+20 outcome, underscored the importance of \r\nthe international community supporting Africa’s \r\nsustainable development efforts and recognized that \r\ngreater attention must be given to Africa, including \r\nthe implementation of previously agreed commitments \r\nrelated to its development needs. We therefore call \r\non development partners to fulfil their promises and \r\ncommitments in the spirit of the Monterrey Consensus \r\nand the Group of Eight Gleneagles Summit. That will \r\ngo a long way in terms of restoring trust, building \r\nconfidence and fostering mutual respect in global \r\npartnerships.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): I am both pleased and \r\nhonoured to speak on behalf of the member States of \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in today’s joint \r\ndebate on the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD), the causes of conflict and the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development in Africa, \r\nand the 2001-2010 Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, Particularly in Africa. Our \r\ndelegations extend their gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his insightful reports (A/69/161, A/69/162 \r\nand A/69/163) under the respective agenda items.\r\nThe Caribbean and Africa are joined by strong ties \r\nof history and culture. Those ties, reinforced by common \r\nstruggles for political independence and economic \r\n14-57494 5/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nemancipation and against colonialism and apartheid, \r\nnow find continuing expression in our mutual quest \r\nfor peace, justice and sustainable development. They \r\nundergird the traditionally fraternal relations that exist \r\nbetween our two regions.\r\nToday’s debate takes place against the background \r\nof an unprecedented Ebola epidemic, which is currently \r\nravaging countries in West Africa. The epidemic \r\nthreatens to reverse peacebuilding and development \r\ngains on the continent and poses serious risks on a \r\nmore global scale. CARICOM takes this opportunity to \r\nexpress our solidarity with the affected countries, most \r\nnotably Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and with the \r\ncontinent as a whole. We call for a massively scaled-up \r\nand multipronged global response in order to turn tide \r\nof the disease, strengthen health systems as a matter \r\nof priority and undo any adverse impacts on peace and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nCARICOM renews its principled support for the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development. African \r\nownership and leadership are fundamental to the success \r\nof the NEPAD framework. We therefore emphasize the \r\nimportance of aligning international support with the \r\npriorities determined by Africans themselves.\r\nOur Community also welcomes the elaboration \r\nof the continent’s Agenda 2063 as an endogenous \r\nshared strategic framework for inclusive growth and \r\nsustainable development for Africa’s transformation \r\nover the next 50 years. Agenda 2063 seeks to realize \r\nthe pan-African vision of an integrated, prosperous \r\nand peaceful Africa and includes, importantly, a near-\r\nterm objective of a conflict-free Africa. CARICOM \r\nbelieves that the Agenda is deserving of strong support \r\nfrom the international community, alongside the efforts \r\nof African countries, with a view to ensuring that its \r\nobjectives are fully realized.\r\nIn that context, the immediate threats to \r\npeace need to be effectively addressed and viable \r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention and peacebuilding \r\nneed to be established or strengthened. Existing \r\nconflict situations, the threat of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism and transnational organized crime will test \r\nthe determination of both Africa and the international \r\ncommunity to see peace and development take a \r\npermanent and irreversible course on the continent.\r\nEven as Africa continues to grapple with significant \r\nchallenges to peace and development, the continent has \r\nwitnessed major development gains in recent times. The \r\nhas region shown strong resilience, with gross domestic \r\nproduct growth averaging 4 per cent in 2013. According \r\nto the 2014 African Economic Outlook, growth in \r\nAfrica is expected to return to the pre-crisis level of \r\n6.5 per cent. While that makes for a promising outlook, \r\nsuch a growth rate is still below the 7 per cent target \r\nregarded as critical for sustained poverty reduction and \r\nprogress towards the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Moreover, the impact of \r\nEbola on Africa’s socioeconomic and security prospects \r\nhas yet to be fully assessed.\r\nThere is therefore a clear need to strengthen \r\ninternational support in order to consolidate and \r\nensure the sustainability of the gains that have been \r\nmade to date. Global official development assistance \r\ncommitments, including those made to Africa in \r\nparticular, need to be honoured in full. In addition, \r\nbased on the findings of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, significantly greater progress needs to be made \r\nin addressing the debt problems of the continent. The \r\ninternational trading system needs to be made more \r\nresponsive to the development imperative in order to \r\nrealize its potential gains in Africa. Expanding the f lows \r\nof foreign direct investment will also be an important \r\npriority in ensuring that Africa’s productive potential \r\nis harnessed to full advantage. The role of South-South \r\ncooperation will remain integral to the global response \r\nto Africa’s development challenges.\r\nCARICOM notes with appreciation the major \r\ninitiatives under way through the Comprehensive \r\nAfrica Agriculture Development Programme to \r\nbuttress agricultural development and food security as \r\na key plank of the region’s development strategy. We \r\nalso note the intensified efforts by African counties to \r\naccelerate infrastructure development, including in the \r\ncritical energy sector. The Dakar Agenda for Action, \r\nadopted in June 2014, provides a framework for the \r\nfinancing of key regional infrastructure projects, which \r\nare critical to unleashing Africa’s growth potential.\r\nCARICOM continues to support Africa’s quest \r\nto improve governance and accountability, reflecting \r\nour shared commitments in that regard. Increasing \r\nsubscription by African countries to the processes of \r\nthe African Peer Review Mechanism is a testament \r\nto the efficacy of that instrument in promoting good \r\ngovernance on the continent. We also share Africa’s \r\ncommitment to activating the potential role of women \r\nand youth in the promotion of durable peace and \r\nsocioeconomic transformation.\r\n6/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nCARICOM expresses the hope that the stability \r\nbeing experienced by most African countries will be \r\nsustained and that setbacks to peace and security will \r\nbe overcome. We support United Nations and African \r\nUnion efforts in conflict prevention, peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding, which are critical to the promotion of \r\ndurable peace and sustainable development. We reaffirm \r\nour support for Africa’s aspiration to permanent seats \r\nand an enhanced non-permanent presence on the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe burden of disease is a continuing obstacle to \r\nAfrica’s progress, as it is in our own region. Malaria \r\ncontinues to pose a significant challenge to Africa \r\nand a broader host of developing countries. The World \r\nHealth Organization estimates that 207 million cases \r\nin 2012 led to approximately 627,000 deaths, most of \r\nthem in Africa. While significant gains have been made \r\nsince 2000 in the fight against malaria, it is evident that \r\nstepped-up action is essential to achieving MDG targets \r\nin this area and eventually achieving a total eradication \r\nof the disease.\r\nHIV/AIDS is another major threat to health and \r\nwell-being in Africa and the Caribbean. In May of this \r\nyear, CARICOM joined forces with the African Union \r\nto explore the role of shared responsibility and the \r\nglobal solidarity agenda in ending the AIDS epidemic \r\nin the Caribbean, drawing on the lessons from the \r\nAfrican Union Roadmap on Shared Responsibility and \r\nGlobal Solidarity for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \r\nResponse in Africa. That process of collaboration \r\nfacilitated further links between countries of both \r\nregions regarding their HIV and health responses. The \r\nmutual threat posed by non-communicable diseases \r\nin our respective regions is another area of common \r\nconcern and collaboration.\r\nIn conclusion, CARICOM reaffirms its commitment \r\nto collaboration with Africa in addressing common \r\nchallenges to peace and development and in contributing \r\ntogether to a more prosperous and secure world.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Poulsen (European Union):I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States.\r\nThe joint Africa-European Union strategy adopted \r\nat the 2007 Summit in Lisbon forms the strategic \r\nframework for our steadily expanding cooperation \r\nand dialogue with Africa. It sets out a comprehensive \r\npartnership of equals, moving away from the traditional \r\ndonor-recipient approach to engage in a systematic \r\npolitical dialogue. Our partnership is guided by the \r\nfundamental principles of the unity of Africa, the \r\ninterdependence between Africa and Europe and \r\nshared values and interests, as well as joint ownership \r\nand responsibilities. Those are also core principles of \r\nthe African Union and the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD).\r\nAt the fourth Africa-EU Summit, held in April \r\nin Brussels, EU and African leaders renewed their \r\ncommitments to work together and agreed to focus \r\non five priorities, namely, peace and security; \r\ndemocracy, good governance and human rights; human \r\ndevelopment; sustainable and inclusive development \r\nand growth and continental integration; and global and \r\nemerging issues. We also committed to consult and \r\nwork in partnership during the upcoming negotiations \r\nwith a view to reaching a consensual outcome in \r\nSeptember 2015.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nrecognize the essential role played by the African Union \r\nand its New Partnership for Africa’s Development in \r\nthe definition of continental policy frameworks and \r\nprogrammes, while respecting in full the notions \r\nof subsidiarity and ownership and as a monitor of \r\ncommitments made towards African development \r\nneeds. Our support includes the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism as the main African-led framework to \r\nmonitor and promote good governance in the continent. \r\nWe also support the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa and the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme. Our aim is to \r\nsupport Africa’s political and economic integration \r\nthrough enhanced trade, a strengthened political \r\npartnership, increased cooperation in promising new \r\nareas and support for institutional capacity-building \r\nat the national, regional and continental levels. The \r\nEuropean Union and its member States remain the \r\nbiggest trading and development partner with the \r\nAfrican continent.\r\nThe promotion of democratic and transparent \r\nsystems of Government and respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms are key components of the \r\njoint Africa-EU strategy. The aim is to facilitate an \r\nopen, broad-based dialogue on all pertinent issues, \r\nincluding human rights and the full enjoyment of such \r\nrights.\r\n14-57494 7/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nWe welcome the progress made by the African \r\nUnion in addressing the many security challenges \r\non the continent, both through African-led peace \r\nsupport operations and through the establishment of \r\nthe African Peace and Security Architecture. We have \r\nsignificantly supported those processes since 2004 with \r\nmore than €1.2 billion. We look forward to pursuing our \r\ncooperation in other areas of common interest, as stated \r\nin the ambitious road map set out at the 2014 Africa-EU \r\nSummit. We will therefore continue to closely follow \r\nthe African-owned policy frameworks and to support \r\ntheir implementation, particularly in the context of the \r\njoint Africa-EU strategic partnership.\r\nAfrica continues to face a huge burden of potentially \r\npreventable or treatable diseases that are causing death \r\nand untold suffering while simultaneously blocking \r\neconomic development. Malaria and other deadly \r\nviruses such as Ebola and HIV impose a tremendous \r\nburden on Africa, particularly on women, children \r\nand the most vulnerable. Significant progress has \r\nbeen made in the global fight against malaria in recent \r\nyears, including in Africa. Experience has shown that \r\nprevention efforts can achieve impressive results when \r\nthey are underpinned by strong and effective health \r\nsystems. But progress will rapidly be reversed if we \r\nrelax our joint efforts. There is still much to do to \r\nreduce even further the number of cases of, and deaths \r\ndue to, malaria.\r\nThat cannot be achieved without sustained \r\ninvestment and political will. Combating diseases \r\nsuch as malaria through strengthened national health \r\nsystems is, in our view, one of the most effective \r\nways to alleviate poverty and promote equitable and \r\nsustainable development. We need to further invest \r\nin the health workforce and build capacity to ensure \r\nequitable access to prevention, treatment and care \r\nthrough the implementation of universal health \r\ncoverage. As the world’s largest donor, both in general \r\nand in the health sector in particular, the European \r\nUnion and its member States will continue to work with \r\nthe Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria, with the United Nations system and with other \r\nrelevant organizations and mechanisms, including \r\nnon-governmental organizations and citizens, to \r\nsupport national responses in strengthening health \r\nsystems to properly address malaria and other diseases.\r\nLet me conclude by emphasizing that the European \r\nUnion and its member States remain fully committed to \r\nsupporting Africa and Africans in their quest for peace, \r\ndemocratic governance, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nMr. Tin (Myanmar): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the 10 member States of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, the Philippines, \r\nSingapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my own country, \r\nMyanmar.\r\nFirst and foremost, we would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive reports \r\n(A/69/161, A/69/162 and A/69/163), which provide us \r\nwith valuable updates, practical recommendations and, \r\nmost of all, the way forward for the development of \r\nAfrica.\r\nASEAN attaches great importance to its long-\r\nstanding relations with Africa. Our friendship has been \r\nforged since the Bandung Conference between the Asian \r\nand African States in Indonesia six decades ago, where \r\nwe shared the same aspiration for the development and \r\nfuture of our regions. The foundation of our relations \r\nwas formed on the basis of mutual respect and trust and \r\nhas been further enhanced through regular dialogue \r\nin regional and international forums. Based on that \r\ntraditional solidarity and friendship, ASEAN voices its \r\nsupport for the full and effective implementation of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), \r\nwhich is a collective vision and strategic framework for \r\nAfrica’s development in the twenty-first century.\r\nWe in ASEAN are very pleased to learn that \r\nAfrica has witnessed remarkable economic growth \r\nin recent years, with an average growth rate of 4 per \r\ncent in 2013. That achievement could be attributed to \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD. We also commend the \r\nprogress that many of our African friends have made in \r\nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nAt the same time, we are fully aware of the \r\nchallenges faced by some African countries in attaining \r\nthe Goals by 2015. ASEAN therefore joins the call for \r\nthe continent’s development partners to make every \r\neffort to deliver on their pledges to those African \r\ncountries that have yet to meet most of the Goals, by \r\nmeans of increased official development assistance \r\n(ODA) or foreign direct investment (FDI).\r\nIt is of great importance to come up with a common \r\nposition on the post-2015 development agenda that \r\ncan address the mutual concerns of both the African \r\n8/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nand Asian regions. It is imperative to ensure that \r\nour efforts to that end are sustainable, inclusive and \r\npeople-centred. ASEAN is prepared to work side by \r\nside with our African partners in that endeavour. In \r\nthat regard, it is important that the priorities identified \r\nby the Common African Position on the Post-2015 \r\nDevelopment Agenda, adopted by the African Union, \r\nbe given special attention and be fully reflected in the \r\nformulation of the development agenda.\r\nPeace and security are at the centre of all \r\ndevelopment. Without that, progress will be impossible. \r\nASEAN notes that some areas in the African region \r\nremain affected by instability and armed conflict. \r\nIn addition, the recent outbreak of the Ebola virus \r\nhas presented an additional hurdle to development. \r\nWe encourage and commend the work of the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development since its adoption, \r\nin 2001, in addressing those concerns.\r\nASEAN is also gratified to learn of the progress \r\nmade by the African countries in implementing \r\nNEPAD, as highlighted in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/69/161). It is also encouraging that ODA to \r\nAfrica has increased despite its downward trend in the \r\npast two years, and that FDI inflows have maintained \r\nan upward trend.\r\nThe progress made in the implementation of the \r\nNEPAD and the success of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism have demonstrated the able leadership \r\nand capability of African leaders to bring peace and \r\ndevelopment to their own continent. At the same time, \r\na strengthened and sustained global partnership still \r\nplays a significant role in bringing about peace, stability \r\nand development in the African continent.\r\nWe also welcome the recent organization of the \r\nAfrica-NEPAD week and the outcome of the review of \r\nthe NEPAD Agency’s partnerships under the 2014-2017 \r\nstrategic framework, which prioritizes environmental \r\nissues and human resource development while \r\nemphasizing a rules- and results-based management \r\napproach. In addition, ASEAN welcomes the \r\nformulation of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and \r\nthe aspiration to a conflict-free Africa. We hope that \r\nthe international community and the United Nations \r\nsystem will lend their full support to the implementation \r\nof Agenda 2063, as it is a development vision driven by \r\nAfrica’s own citizens. In that light, we hope that our \r\ncooperation under bilateral, South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation frameworks through capacity-building \r\nprogrammes and scholarships can contribute to the \r\nwork of the NEPAD in bringing about practical benefits \r\nto African countries on behalf of their development \r\nagenda.\r\nMalaria is a common disease that imposes a \r\nvery high burden on both of the ASEAN and African \r\nregions. The malaria situation for ASEAN countries \r\nis mixed and varied, but we are still facing common \r\nchallenges in finding a solution together. ASEAN \r\ntherefore welcomes the recent adoption of resolution \r\n68/308, entitled “Consolidating gains and accelerating \r\nefforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing \r\ncountries, particularly in Africa, by 2015”. The \r\nresolution urges Governments - together with United \r\nNations agencies, private organizations and foundations \r\n- to work together to overcome challenges and speed \r\nup efforts towards the targets set out in the Roll Back \r\nMalaria Partnership’s Global Malaria Action Plan and \r\nin the MDGs.\r\nIn that connection, we welcome the successful \r\nconclusion in our capital, Yangon, on 29 September, of \r\na regional forum on opportunities for corporate sector \r\nengagement in malaria control in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion. The one-day forum was organized by the Roll \r\nBack Malaria Partnership and its partners and sought \r\nto identify tangible opportunities for strengthening \r\npublic-private partnerships to support regional \r\nmalaria-control strategies. ASEAN also welcomes the \r\nvaluable assistance that the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria provided to developing \r\ncountries in their efforts to eradicate those diseases.\r\nWe also appreciate the Secretary-General’s quick \r\nresponse in establishing the United Nations Mission \r\nfor Ebola Emergency Response in Accra. We must all \r\nunite to fight the Ebola epidemic, as it has become a \r\nthreat to development and to human security beyond \r\nAfrica. ASEAN member States will extend their full \r\nsupport to Africa’s efforts to combat pandemic diseases \r\nand are ready to share and exchange information and \r\nexperiences in addressing them.\r\nLast but not least, ASEAN joins the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call to continue the international community’s \r\nsupport to help accelerate efforts to achieve the MDGs \r\nand sustainable growth in Africa and to align such \r\nassistance with the priorities of NEPAD.\r\nIn concluding, ASEAN would like to reiterate its \r\nsolidarity and support to the endeavours of our African \r\nfriends and the international community in achieving \r\n14-57494 9/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\ngreater progress in implementing the NEPAD agenda \r\nfor the benefit of the peoples of Africa.\r\nMs. Hazara Chana (United Republic of Tanzania): \r\nI am honoured to participate in this joint debate of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which coincides with the culmination \r\nof Africa’s New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\nweek 2014. I am very pleased to see you, Mr. President, \r\npresiding over a meeting devoted to an agenda item that \r\nis so important for Africa and that blends seamlessly \r\nwith the theme of the Assembly’s current session, that \r\nis, “Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda”. Africa is an important \r\npartner in that vital global development agenda. As the \r\nAmbassador of Malawi and Chair of the African Group \r\nalluded to in the statement he delivered on behalf \r\nof the Group, to which Tanzania fully subscribes, \r\nAfrica is ready to engage in formulating the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his reports on \r\nthe agenda items under consideration today (A/69/161, \r\nA/69/162 and A/69/163) and for his stewardship \r\nand commitment to keeping Africa on the agenda \r\nof all United Nations activities. We also commend \r\nMr. Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer \r\nof the New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) Planning and Coordinating Agency, and \r\nthe entire NEPAD secretariat for their continued \r\ngood work in implementing NEPAD’s programmes \r\non behalf of the African Union. We also pay tribute \r\nto the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, the \r\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Africa, the \r\nAfrican Development Bank and the other regional and \r\ninternational partners who support the implementation \r\nof NEPAD’s agenda.\r\nThis joint debate takes place at a very critical \r\njuncture, as the world is bracing itself for the decisive \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, to commence early next year. \r\nThat momentous process will follow the fulfilment of \r\nthe Rio+20 mandates, including the work of the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwhich delivered a salutary set of goals and targets to \r\nbe integrated into the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nWe note with great satisfaction that the proposal took \r\ninto account most of Africa’s development aspirations \r\nencapsulated in the Common African Position on the \r\nPost-2015 Development Agenda. This gives us hope \r\nthat Africa will have full ownership of the goals once \r\nthey are adopted in September of next year.\r\nWe are confident that proposals from other Rio+20 \r\nfollow-up processes, including the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing, the Third International Conference on \r\nSmall Island Developing States, the High-level Political \r\nForum - which met under the auspices of the Economic \r\nand Social Council for the first time, in June - and the \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nto be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015, will contribute \r\nto a transformative post-2015 development agenda that \r\nmeets the aspirations of both developing and developed \r\ncountries.\r\nOf paramount importance for Tanzania and Africa \r\nis the eradication of poverty in all forms. Poverty is \r\na chronic challenge that could not be surmounted in \r\nthe era of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nIt is imperative, therefore, that the post-2015 agenda \r\naddress the unfinished business of the MDGs on the \r\naspect of poverty and hunger, maternal and child \r\nhealth, the eradication of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria, and ensuring a strengthened \r\nglobal partnership for development.\r\nTanzania would like to underscore the importance \r\nof means of implementation, a prerequisite for the \r\nattainment of sustainable development. Our countries \r\nhave resolved to enhance the mobilization of domestic \r\nresources. However, we are fully aware that such \r\nresources in themselves are insufficient to meet the \r\ndevelopment needs of our countries and continent. We \r\nshall continue to call of development partners to fulfil \r\ntheir promises and commitments made to Africa in \r\ndifferent forums, in terms of financing, trade, capacity-\r\nbuilding and, most critically, technology transfer. \r\nTanzania awaits in anticipation the conclusion of \r\ndiscussions on the establishment of a mechanism for the \r\ntransfer and dissemination of clean and environmentally \r\nsound technologies to developing countries. I can \r\nonly underscore at this juncture that this must be part \r\nand parcel of the post-2015 development agenda as \r\nenvisaged in “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, \r\nannex).\r\nNEPAD is Africa’s pride. Over the years since \r\nits adoption, it has progressively contributed to the \r\nrealization of Africa’s vision and strategic framework \r\nfor political and socioeconomic transformation on \r\npriority areas, including agriculture and food security, \r\nregional integration and infrastructure, climate change \r\nand natural resource management, and political and \r\n10/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\neconomic governance. We are confident that NEPAD’s \r\nagenda will continue to align itself fully with Africa’s \r\ndevelopment aspirations in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, as inspired by Africa’s 2063 Agenda.\r\nLast year we celebrated the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme (CAADP). This year we have celebrated \r\nAfrica’s Year of Agriculture and Food Security, with \r\nthe adoption in June of the Malabo Declaration on \r\nAccelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation \r\nfor Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods, which \r\nre-enacts the CAADP agenda for the next decade. The \r\nTanzanian Government is already implementing the \r\ntransformative actions encapsulated in the Declaration, \r\nincluding on increasing investment in agriculture \r\nthrough domestic resource mobilization and enhanced \r\npartnership, as well as the promotion of climate-smart \r\nagriculture. \r\nSince signing the CAADP compact in July 2010, the \r\nGovernment has launched the Tanzania Food Security \r\nInvestment Plan, a 15-year investment plan whose \r\nultimate objective is to contribute to national economic \r\ngrowth, household income and food security, in line \r\nwith national and sectoral development aspirations. \r\nNational programmes such as the Southern Agriculture \r\nGrowth Corridor of Tanzania and the Kilimo Kwanza \r\nresolution are truly transforming Tanzania’s agriculture \r\nsector. We can only underscore here the importance of \r\nnational leadership and ownership in realizing these \r\nimportant development aspirations for our people.\r\nInfrastructure is also an important sector for \r\nTanzania’s and Africa’s realization of sustainable \r\ndevelopment aspirations and regional integration. \r\nWe commend the NEPAD Agency for the steady \r\nimplementation of the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa, undertaken with limited available \r\nresources. We note that sustainable infrastructure \r\ndevelopment will require the mobilization of financial \r\nresources from all sources, including the private sector. \r\nWe welcome the Dakar Agenda for Action adopted in \r\nJune for financing the 16 pilot infrastructure projects \r\nin Africa, including in our subregion of Eastern Africa. \r\nWe call upon development partners to support Africa’s \r\nendeavour that regard.\r\nTanzania is fully committed to NEPAD’s African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM), whose main objective \r\nis to promote good governance across the continent. \r\nThe APRM process has been a useful tool for building \r\ncapacity on monitoring governance, developing \r\npartnerships and enhancing advocacy for efficiency, \r\neffectiveness and transparency in leadership. We note \r\nthe constraints facing the APRM process, which are \r\naffecting the optimal fulfilment of its mandate. We \r\ncommend the African Peer Review Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons, under the leadership of Ms. Fatuma Ndangiza, \r\nfor steering the work of the Mechanism. Tanzania is \r\namong the 17 countries that have already undergone the \r\npeer review process. We are currently consolidating the \r\ngains registered in the area of governance, which have \r\ncharacterized our nation since its independence.\r\nWe are currently undertaking constitutional \r\nreform, with the ultimate objective of enacting a new \r\nconstitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, which \r\nwill guide our people towards a secure and prosperous \r\nfuture. The constitution-drafting process has reached \r\na decisive stage, as the Constitutional Assembly has \r\nadopted a draft constitution. The next critical stage \r\nis a referendum, which will provide the citizenry \r\nan opportunity to determine the status of that draft \r\nconstitution.\r\nIt has been stated before in this very Hall that \r\nAfrica has solutions for African challenges. If I may \r\nadd, our respective States also have solutions for our \r\nnational challenges. Doors are always open for well-\r\nwishers who continue to render a helping hand to Africa \r\nand our respective countries in tackling the multitude \r\nof challenges we face.\r\nOver the past 10 years, we have registered some \r\nsuccesses in the fight against malaria. More than \r\n1 million lives have been saved. Mortality has been \r\nreduced by more than a quarter globally and by a third \r\nin Africa through the collaborative efforts of various \r\nstakeholders. In Tanzania, we succeeded in reducing \r\nthe prevalence of malaria in young children by 44 per \r\ncent between 2008 and May 2012. In Zanzibar, deaths \r\ndue to malaria are nearly zero. For mainland Tanzania, \r\ndifferent interventions are being undertaken, including \r\nresidual spraying on malaria breeding sites, long-\r\nlasting insecticide-treated nets being made available \r\nat every bedside, early treatment for those infected \r\nwith malaria, and control and surveillance to prevent \r\nre-emergence and epidemics. Similar success stories \r\ncan be found in other African countries.\r\nWhile those interventions produce dramatic \r\ndeclines in infection, morbidity and mortality, declines \r\nare not sufficient to interrupt transmission. Malaria \r\n14-57494 11/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nis still a global threat, affecting 99 countries globally \r\nand contributing to 655,000 deaths per year. Malaria \r\nkills a child in Africa every minute. The African \r\nregion accounts for almost 81 per cent of malaria cases \r\noccurring worldwide. Ninety per cent of malaria deaths \r\noccur in the region, with 86 per cent being children \r\nbelow five years of age. It is for this reason that the \r\ncurrent strategies alone are unlikely to achieve the goal \r\nof elimination. They are also at risk of diminishing \r\nefficacy due to the development of drug resistance on \r\nthe part of parasites and insecticide resistance on the \r\npart Anopheles mosquitos.\r\nOn the other hand, the Government has embarked \r\non an expensive comprehensive programme to \r\ndeal with the question of access to health care. The \r\nprogramme will ensure that there is a dispensary in \r\nevery village and a health-care centre in every ward. \r\nThe programme will certainly be instrumental in the \r\nsuccess of our anti-malaria effort, as it will guarantee \r\nprompt diagnosis and prompt treatment. It is in this \r\nendeavour that we need partnerships and support from \r\nthe international community. We thank our bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners who have provided us with \r\nfinancial and technical support. We call for their \r\ncontinued support to complement the Government’s \r\nefforts to implementthe malaria strategy and eradicate \r\nmalaria in Tanzania.\r\nIt would be remiss of me to conclude without \r\nsaying some words regarding the Ebola outbreak in \r\nWest Africa, which has struck yet another blow to \r\nour economies and our peoples. Ebola is multiplying \r\nfaster than our collective interventions to prevent and \r\nultimately eradicate it. The outbreak has exposed the \r\nfragility of the health systems and the capacity of our \r\ncountries to respond to deadly outbreaks. We commend \r\nyou, Mr. President, the Secretary-General and the \r\nentire United Nations system, as well as Member \r\nStates and regional organizations, for responding \r\nswiftly in mobilizing political will and resources. \r\nOur interventions in the short and medium term must \r\nfocus on saving the lives of those affected, preventing \r\nthe spread of the disease and ultimately eliminating it \r\nfrom the face of the Earth. Our long-term goal must \r\nbe to address the structural handicaps and institutional \r\nweaknesses characterizing the health sector in \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in Africa.\r\nMs. Strasser-King (Sierra Leone): At the outset, \r\nas this is the first time I take the f loor, allow me to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession and to wish you success during your tenure. Let \r\nme also express my profound gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports (A/69/161, A/69/162 and \r\nA/69/163) and to extend appreciation to the organizers \r\nof this event. \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representatives of Malawi on \r\nbehalf of the African Group.\r\nIn this era of global transformation, peace \r\nand development have become even more closely \r\ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing. Against that \r\nbackdrop, the focus on peace and development could \r\nnot have been better timed than at the moment when the \r\ninternational community is grappling with challenges \r\nranging from poverty, hunger, the devastating effects \r\nof climate change, terrorism, organized crime and \r\ndrug trafficking, disarmament, and the reconstruction \r\nand strengthening of fragile economies and societies \r\nemerging from conflicts, to the ongoing stock taking \r\nof the progress of implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which the Assembly pledged in \r\n2010 to achieve by 2015.\r\nWe have come a long way. The voyage has been \r\nbumpy and at times turbulent, yet we have remained \r\nfocused. The effects of climate change, conflicts and \r\npandemics have continued to compromise the efforts \r\nof African States. Despite the challenges, we have, as \r\na continent, made significant strides in reducing the \r\nresurgence of conflicts during the last decade.\r\nMy delegation emphasizes the importance of peace \r\nand security as a necessary condition for development \r\nin Africa. Development is impossible without peace, \r\njust as peace is impossible without development, \r\nand lasting peace and sustainable development are \r\nimpossible without respect for human rights and the rule \r\nof law. Building stable and peaceful societies in Africa \r\nrequires action to eradicate poverty and inequality and \r\nenhance good governance.\r\nAs poverty is both a cause and consequence of \r\ninstability and conflict, the continent cannot achieve \r\npeace and development without addressing poverty in \r\nits entirety. To that end, the continent will continue to \r\nwork with the wider international community to prevent \r\noutbreaks of armed conflicts. \r\nAfrica is the region that needs the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals more than any other region. We \r\n12/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nhave the unique opportunity to ensure that the critical \r\nissues confronting our continent — poverty, hunger, \r\nthe effects of climate change, inequality and youth \r\nemployment — are adequately addressed in the post-\r\n2015 development framework.\r\nSierra Leone is among the countries of Africa that \r\nhave made remarkable progress in political stability. \r\nWe continue to place emphasis on the protection of \r\nthe basic rights of our people. We have put in place \r\ncomprehensive justice sector reforms in response to \r\nboth national and global demands to ensure that the \r\nrights of our people are preserved, and above all, to \r\nenhance access to justice for all. We are pleased to note \r\nthat the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant \r\non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights entered into \r\nforce last year.\r\nWithin the security, political, humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment framework, we have adopted measures \r\nto address many of the root causes of conflict and lay \r\nthe foundation for medium and long-term national \r\ndevelopment. We are heartened by the remarkable \r\nprogress our country has made, especially in \r\nidentifying and resolving tensions and threats of \r\npotential conflict, monitoring and promoting human \r\nrights, building peace and security, and consolidating \r\ngood governance reforms. These provide us with the \r\nappropriate healing therapy for a country that has \r\nemerged from a massively devastating conflict. We \r\nhave gone from being a country on the agenda of the \r\nSecurity Council to a nation that is a storehouse of \r\nlessons on how to successfully move away from war to \r\npeace and development. Sierra Leone is considered a \r\nmodel of best practices in donor coordination, as well as \r\na success story in peacebuilding. We enjoy accolades in \r\ncharting the path for a peaceful, secure and democratic \r\nSierra Leone.\r\nAs we commend ourselves for the gains made, \r\nour remarkable post-conflict achievement is in \r\ndanger of being completely reversed if a vigorous and \r\nwell-coordinated effort is not made to eradicate the \r\nunprecedented Ebola virus. The disease has already \r\nclaimed thousands of lives and threatens to kill \r\nthousands more if drastic action is not taken to contain \r\nit. The effect of the disease has not only been terrifying, \r\nbut has also impacted the entire socioeconomic fabric \r\nof the countries currently affected by it. The epidemic \r\nis now causing huge disruptions to the agricultural, \r\nmining, manufacturing, transportation, tourism and \r\nconstruction sectors. It also poses a significant threat \r\nto human development, State security and poverty \r\nreduction. Economic disruptions are already being felt. \r\nGovernment revenues are drying up. In short, Ebola \r\nhas imposed a kind of economic embargo on us. Every \r\nmajor economic activity has either slowed down or \r\ncome to a complete standstill.\r\nAmid our current challenges, we will continue to \r\nbuild on progress made in addressing key development \r\npriorities, particularly in the areas of gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment, youth unemployment and \r\nempowerment, the management of natural resources, \r\nagriculture and food security, the effective delivery of \r\npublic services, and a robust private sector-led growth \r\nthat could translate into more tangible peace dividends.\r\nMr. Albuaijan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports under agenda item \r\n62 (a) and (b), concerning the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development (NEPAD), including on the \r\nimplementation of commitments towards Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. We have reviewed with interest the \r\nreports contained in documents A/69/161 and A/69/163, \r\nin which he emphasizes the political measures taken \r\nby African countries and organizations to implement \r\nNEPAD in the four thematic areas under review: \r\nagriculture, food security and nutrition; financing \r\nfor development; environmental stability and climate \r\nchange; and good governance.\r\nIt would be remiss of me not to commend all \r\nefforts to implement the programme intended to \r\ntransform Africa over the next 50 years, endorsed by \r\nthe twenty-first African Union Summit in May 2013, \r\nwhich will provide a strategic framework for Africa’s \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. The review of the \r\nprogress in the implementation of NEPAD underlines \r\nthe necessity of continuing to establish partnerships \r\nto address issues related to security, food security, \r\npoverty, disease, human rights and the rule of law, as \r\nwell as environmental issues such as desertification \r\nand drought. We should like to thank Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral Maged Abdelaziz, Special Adviser on Africa, \r\nand the Permanent Observer of the African Union for \r\nconvening a high-level dialogue entitled “The Next 50 \r\nYears: The Africa We Want” in order to support the \r\nefforts of the African Union programme looking to \r\n2063, which will aid economic, social and political \r\ndevelopment.\r\nHaving reviewed the Secretary-General’s two \r\nreports, we should like to express our grave concern \r\n14-57494 13/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nthat Africa has not achieved its goal in fighting hunger. \r\nWe are also dismayed by the findings on agriculture \r\nand food security in the report in A/69/163. Arable land \r\nhas not kept up with population growth, as only 6 per \r\ncent of the land can be irrigated. The proportion of \r\nthe population suffering undernutrition fell modestly, \r\nfrom 33 per cent to 25 per cent from 1990 to 2013, \r\nwhile widespread undernutrition continues to affect \r\nmore than 13 million people in Africa. The report also \r\nstates that Africa faces environmental challenges, \r\nsuch as deforestation, soil degradation and loss of \r\nbiological diversity. We should like to underline the \r\nimportance of taking into consideration the report’s \r\nrecommendations, especially in regard to good \r\ngovernance, and that national and international efforts \r\nshould continue to achieve lasting peace in Africa by \r\nsupporting democracy, enhancing peace and security, \r\nand fighting corruption.\r\nA number of African countries, especially in \r\nWest Africa, face challenges arising from the growing \r\nprevalence of Ebola. Therefore, Kuwait, in view of \r\nits strong historical ties to Africa, has responded to \r\nthe international humanitarian appeals to mitigate \r\nthe consequences of the disease and has contributed \r\n$5 million to the World Health Organization in response \r\nto its call for funding to eradicate that scourge and \r\nprovide a dignified life for all peoples.\r\nThirteen years have elapsed since the adoption \r\nof NEPAD, which is a comprehensive strategic \r\nvision to achieve political and social development in \r\nAfrica. Twelve years have elapsed since the General \r\nAssembly organized a high-level dialogue on NEPAD, \r\non 16 September 2002 (see A/57/PV.10) and adopted \r\nresolution 57/7 that November, declaring NEPAD to be \r\nthe framework for development in Africa. \r\nWe would like to emphasize that my country \r\nstrongly supports global cooperation in eradicating \r\npoverty, alleviating debt and combating diseases such \r\nas AIDS and malaria, which are exacerbated by a lack \r\nof support for economic development and development \r\nprojects. That requires a serious effort on the part of the \r\ninternational community to achieve the internationally \r\nagreed development goals, as well as the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and Africa’s ambitious Vision 2063.\r\nWe are proud of our historical ties with a large \r\nnumber of African countries. From 18 to 20 November \r\n2013, we hosted the Third Afro-Arab Summit, under \r\nthe theme “Partners in development and investment,” \r\nin order to deepen Arab and African cooperation and \r\nopen up new horizons for stability, development and \r\ncooperation for the countries of those two groups. On \r\nthe basis of our belief in the importance of support \r\nand humanitarian and development assistance for \r\ndeveloping and less developed countries, at the Summit \r\nwe declared the initiative of His Royal Highness the \r\nAmir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber \r\nAl-Sabah, to provide concessional loans to African \r\ncountries totalling $1 billion over the next five years. \r\nAnother investment initiative, in coordination with the \r\nWorld Bank and other financial institutions, totalled \r\n$1 billion.\r\nFurthermore, the annual prize endowed by the \r\nlate Mr. Abdul Rahman Al-Sumait in the sum of \r\n$1 million was allocated to development projects \r\nunder the supervision of the Kuwait Foundation for the \r\nAdvancement of Sciences. In appreciation of the late \r\nMr. Al-Sumait’s prominent and effective role in Africa \r\nrepresented by his philanthropic work, Kuwait attaches \r\ngreat importance to the role of the Kuwaiti Fund for \r\nArab Economic Development in 48 out of 54 countries, \r\nas we believe in joint work for the benefit of developing \r\ncountries. Our contributions in that fund in Africa total \r\n$6.4 billion.\r\nIn conclusion, I recall that, given our historical \r\nties with Africa - our long heritage, common interests, \r\naspirations and destiny - the international community, \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations and \r\nthe private sector must work together to help Africa \r\nfulfil its aspirations and its development ambitions and \r\nadvance its economies.\r\nMr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): Thailand aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Myanmar on behalf of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations. \r\nWe thank you, Mr President, for your own \r\nimportant opening statement. Thailand thanks the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive report entitled \r\n“New Partnership for Africa’s Development: twelfth \r\nconsolidated progress report on implementation and \r\ninternational support” (A/69/161). We also acknowledge \r\nthe untiring efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nAdviser on Africa, Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz, and \r\nhis presence here this morning.\r\nThailand commends our African brothers and \r\nsisters for their untiring efforts to transform Africa into \r\na continent of hope or, in your own words, Mr. President, \r\n“Africa rising”. Africa is a continent with enormous \r\n14/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\npotential and innumerable opportunities. The New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and \r\nother regional initiatives have greatly contributed to the \r\nsuccess and progress towards achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in Africa. \r\nHowever, despite such remarkable progress, Africa \r\ncontinues to face a number of persistent and emerging \r\nchallenges, including political and armed conflict, \r\nterrorism, climate change, epidemics, poverty and \r\nfamine. Together, we must ensure that such challenges \r\nwill not undo past success or hinder the future of \r\nAfrica. As the Secretary-General states in his report, \r\nthe year 2015 is fast approaching and enormous effort \r\nis needed to push forward towards the attainment of the \r\nMDGs in Africa.\r\nThailand is committed to fostering a long-\r\nterm strategic partnership with Africa. In 2013, we \r\nlaunched the Thai-African Initiative, one of our most \r\nimportant foreign policy agendas. This partnership \r\ninitiative is based on three main pillars of cooperation: \r\ndevelopment, economic matters and global affairs. \r\nThailand therefore warmly welcomes the formulation of \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063 Vision and Priorities \r\nand the Common African Position on the Post-2015 \r\nDevelopment Agenda. Thailand views such a vision and \r\npriorities as fitting well with our Thai-Africa Initiative \r\nto formulate and coordinate policy direction towards \r\nmutually beneficial areas of cooperation.\r\nAgriculture, as the Secretary-General states in \r\none report, is the key to Africa’s transformation. With \r\n2014 being the Year of Agriculture and Food Security, \r\nthe Thailand International Development Cooperation \r\nAgency has implemented a number of agriculture-related \r\nprojects in Africa. Priority, of course, is given to the \r\nexchange of know-how on sustainable agricultural \r\ndevelopment and food processing. Collaboration \r\nprojects range from development of mushroom-growing \r\nin Swaziland to rice cultivation in Mozambique and \r\nsmall-scale fisheries in Madagascar and Mozambique \r\nto the upgrading of a laboratory for hatchery operations \r\nin Senegal. Such projects are in line with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s recommendation on the need to increase \r\nproductivity, thereby enabling Africa to be more self-\r\nreliant, and on the need to ease food insecurity concerns.\r\nWith regard to public health, Thailand is actively \r\ncooperating with Africa through expertise-sharing. \r\nOur cooperation focuses on strengthening human-\r\nresource capacity in the prevention and treatment of \r\nserious epidemics and community-based public health \r\nmanagement.\r\nMr. Boureima (Niger), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThailand also supported and co-sponsored resolution \r\n55/284, “2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in \r\nDeveloping Countries, particularly in Africa”, with \r\nspecial emphasis on universal and equitable access \r\nto treatment and medication. On that point, Thailand \r\nstands ready to share its own experiences and lessons \r\nlearned in developing universal health coverage. We \r\nfeel that such coverage can help African countries put \r\nin place a medical-service system with universal access \r\nand financial risk protection for their people. \r\nThe health and welfare of our African brothers and \r\nsisters are of concern, especially those currently facing \r\nthe Ebola crisis. Thailand has so far contributed over \r\n$152,000 to the World Health Organization to provide \r\nrice to help relieve the food-shortage crisis facing the \r\npeople in Ebola-affected areas. Such humanitarian \r\nassistance will continue, from both the Thai Government \r\nand private sectors, to help fight that epidemic.\r\nWith regard to education and human-capital \r\ndevelopment, we believe that economic growth, \r\nsustainable development and long-term peace and \r\nsecurity all go hand in hand. They can be achieved only \r\nthrough the development of human capital. Thailand \r\ntherefore gives high priority to this important area \r\nof cooperation by providing scholarships for higher \r\neducation, and fellowships for training are provided in \r\nareas where our expertise could be of value to Africa. \r\nWe shall continue our development cooperation under \r\nvarious frameworks, be they bilateral, trilateral, \r\nmultilateral or South-South cooperation.\r\nDuring the general debate in this very Hall last \r\nmonth, many African leaders called on the international \r\ncommunity to recognize and respond to Africa’s \r\ndevelopment priorities in the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. This was reiterated this morning by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Malawi on behalf of the \r\nAfrican States. Thailand echoes those calls, for peace \r\nand development in Africa matters not only within the \r\ncontinent but also far beyond. The maintenance of peace \r\nand sustainable development in Africa must also be the \r\nshared responsibility of the international community.\r\nThailand commends the contributions of the \r\nAfrican Union, the Economic Community of West \r\n14-57494 15/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nAfrican States and other regional organizations, as \r\nwell as the United Nations, in addressing these two \r\ncritical issues. In the spirit of solidarity, Thailand has \r\njoined global efforts in the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity in Africa by participating in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions in the Sudan and in Liberia. \r\nWe remain committed to strengthening our global \r\npartnership for the development in Africa and stand \r\nready to share our experiences and best practices in \r\nareas that our African brothers and sisters may deem \r\nuseful.\r\nMs. Hamilton (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States of America welcomes this opportunity \r\nto share views with colleagues on the progress of \r\nand support for the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD). Today’s discussion and the \r\nissues involved - security, governance and inclusive \r\neconomic growth, among others - present an opportunity \r\nto further bolster Africa’s development trajectory as we \r\nenvision the continent’s development over the next 50 \r\nyears.\r\nThe United States continues to support the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development as the strategic \r\nframework for socioeconomic development in Africa \r\nthat reflects the African States’ collective vision. We \r\nsupport NEPAD priorities for democratization, good \r\ngovernance and economic transparency, as well as \r\nits initiatives to enhance regional- and national-level \r\ninfrastructure, food security and nutrition. The United \r\nStates looks forward to engagement on the Agenda \r\n2063 process.\r\nThe United States recognizes the tenth anniversary \r\nof the establishment of the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism (APRM). My delegation commends the \r\nAfrican-led APRM process to share experiences and \r\nreinforce best practices. It appreciates the enthusiasm \r\nand dedication of the APRM secretariat to this process.\r\nRegarding food security, the United States views \r\nAfrican countries as essential partners in United \r\nStates food security initiatives. In 2013, the United \r\nStates’ Feed the Future initiative reached more than \r\n12.5 million children with nutrition interventions. \r\nFeed the Future also helped nearly 7 million farmers \r\nand other food producers incorporate new technologies \r\nand management practices on more than 4 million \r\nhectares of land. The United States also supports the \r\nComprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, under which the African Union and African \r\nnations are encouraged to invest in the development of \r\ntheir agricultural sectors.\r\nThe New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition \r\ninitiative has expanded to 10 African countries. It \r\nnow includes more than 160 local and international \r\ncompanies, and has secured more than $7 billion \r\nin planned investments only two years after its \r\nlaunch. Through the New Alliance and Grow Africa \r\npartnerships, more than 2.6 million small farmers \r\nhave already been reached through services, training, \r\nsourcing or production contracts.\r\nThe United States strongly supports African \r\nefforts to generate broad-based, sustained and inclusive \r\neconomic growth and applauds those countries that \r\npursue strategies to reduce poverty and unemployment, \r\nand integrate further into the global economy. The United \r\nStates particularly supports efforts to create enabling \r\nbusiness environments that facilitate development. In \r\nthis context, the United States commends the NEPAD \r\nPlanning and Coordinating Agency for its work to \r\nsupport the initiatives of individual Governments in \r\nconjunction with the African Union, the United Nations \r\nand the African Development Bank. Predictable and \r\ntransparent business environments are critical elements \r\nfor attracting domestic and foreign investment and for \r\nsustained private sector growth.\r\nAt the United States-Africa Leaders Summit in \r\nAugust 2014, President Obama announced measures, \r\nincluding Overseas Private Investment Corporation \r\nsupport for United States investment, to help spur \r\nAfrican development. Concurrently, we aim to bring \r\nelectricity to 60 million African homes and businesses \r\nthrough new commitments to the Power Africa \r\ninitiative. We also seek to achieve a seamless and long-\r\nterm renewal of the African Growth and Opportunity \r\nAct.\r\nWhile international support is important, Africa’s \r\ngrowth depends, more than anything, on continued \r\nreforms undertaken by Africans themselves. We urge \r\nfurther action on reforms that will attract investment, \r\npromote a transparent business climate, reduce barriers \r\nto trade and promote regional integration. The United \r\nStates stands ready to help build Africa’s capacity to \r\ntrade with itself and with the world.\r\nThe United States urges the international \r\ncommunity to agree on a meaningful and ambitious \r\npost-2015 development agenda by next September. My \r\ndelegation places a particular priority on the unfinished \r\n16/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nbusiness of the Millennium Development Goals, but \r\nit also recognizes the need to go further and address \r\nknown drivers of development progress, especially \r\nwomen’s equality and empowerment, inclusive and \r\nsustained economic growth, sustainable energy, \r\npeace and governance. The post-2015 development \r\nagenda will require crafting a true global partnership. \r\nThis partnership must go beyond traditional aid and \r\nencompass actions and investments from all countries \r\nand all sources.\r\nAs President Obama noted last month in the general \r\ndebate (see A/69/PV.6), America is committed to a \r\ndevelopment agenda that eradicates extreme poverty \r\nby 2030. The United States, in cooperation with our \r\nAfrican partners, will help people feed themselves, \r\npower their economies and care for their sick. Working \r\ntogether, we can make sure that all of our children enjoy \r\nlives of opportunity and dignity.\r\nMy delegation also appreciates the opportunity to \r\nconsider the Assembly’s agenda item on the Decade \r\nto Roll Back Malaria. The United States remains \r\ndetermined to work with national Governments and \r\nother partners to help end deaths from malaria. Our \r\nPresident’s Malaria Initiative, launched in 2005, \r\nrepresented an historic $1.2 billion, five-year expansion \r\nof United States Government resources to fight malaria \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa. The Initiative’s strategy was \r\nexpanded for the 2009-2014 period, with the goal of \r\nachieving Africa-wide impact by halving the burden \r\nof malaria in 70 per cent of at-risk populations in \r\nsub-Saharan Africa. The President’s Malaria Initiative \r\nnow focuses programme support in 19 countries in \r\nAfrica, as well as in countries in the Greater Mekong \r\nsub-region of southeast Asia. In 2013 alone, the Initiative \r\nprotected more than 45 million people against malaria \r\nwith a prevention measure. It has also procured more \r\nthan 48 million anti-malaria treatments and 51 million \r\nrapid diagnostic tests. With the United States support, \r\ncountries are supporting and strengthening their own \r\ncapacity to fight the disease. \r\nInvestments in malaria prevention and control \r\nare positively impacting the lives of millions of \r\nchildren, pregnant women and families in Africa. It is \r\na tremendous success story, yet it is still incomplete. \r\nThe President’s Malaria Initiative is developing a new \r\nstrategy for 2015-2020. That strategy will outline the \r\nUnited States Government’s approach to working with \r\npartner countries to accelerate progress in malaria \r\ncontrol, moving closer to the goal of eliminating \r\nmalaria as a major public health threat with a vision of \r\na malaria-free Africa ever more real.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\npursuit of peace and development by African countries \r\nis at a critical new juncture. With their booming \r\neconomies, African countries have made remarkable \r\nprogress in the implementation of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and in maintaining \r\nstability and the momentum of development. At the \r\nsame time, as a result of the international financial \r\ncrisis, local regional conflicts and hotspot issues, \r\nespecially the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the \r\nhumanitarian crisis in Africa is worsening. All that has \r\nposed daunting challenges to Africa’s efforts to achieve \r\npeace, stability and development.\r\nAfrica’s development is an integral part of \r\ninternational cooperation for development and it \r\nis only by promoting Africa’s development that we \r\ncan facilitate the achievement of global prosperity. \r\nThe international community should attach great \r\nimportance to and carry out strategic cooperation with \r\nAfrica. In that connection, China wishes to make the \r\nfollowing proposals. \r\nFirst, the development of Africa should be the \r\npriority of the post-2015 development agenda. The \r\ninternational community should help Africa speed up \r\nits attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nIn preparing the post-2015 development agenda, \r\npriority should be given to Africa’s needs. Developed \r\ncountries should honour their commitments of official \r\ndevelopment assistance, provide African countries \r\nwith financial and technical assistance and help them \r\nwith capacity-building. Developing countries should \r\nstrengthen South-South cooperation as a supplement to \r\nNorth-South cooperation. The international community \r\nshould work to improve the environment for Africa’s \r\ndevelopment, including by increasing its financial \r\nassistance and supporting trade and debt reduction and \r\ncancellation. \r\nSecondly, the international community must \r\njoin hands to help West African countries cope with \r\nthe Ebola epidemic. The current outbreak of Ebola is \r\nspreading in West Africa, posing a serious threat to \r\nlocal people’s lives and health. It has become a shared, \r\nnon-traditional security challenge for the international \r\ncommunity. The top priority is to implement the \r\nUnited Nations strategy in response to Ebola and \r\nstrongly support the United Nations Mission for Ebola \r\n14-57494 17/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nEmergency Response. It is necessary to send more \r\nmedical personnel and experts to the affected areas, \r\nprovide protective gear and material, help treat affected \r\nindividuals, improve screening and testing capability \r\nand help local communities in Ebola prevention and \r\ncontrol. Countries should also increase assistance to \r\nAfrica to help it enhance capacity-building in the area \r\nof public health. \r\nThirdly, African countries’ efforts to realize peace \r\nand stability should be supported. The international \r\ncommunity should uphold the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, and, on the basis \r\nof full respect for the sovereignty, independence and \r\nterritorial integrity of the African countries concerned, \r\nit should actively promote peace and facilitate \r\nnegotiations with a view to finding peaceful settlements \r\nto disputes. The international community should \r\nstrengthen coordination and collaboration with the \r\nAfrican Union and other African regional organizations, \r\nhelp Africa strengthen its institution-building in the \r\narea of collective security and support the settlement \r\nof African issues by Africans through African means. \r\nChina and Africa have always been a community \r\nof shared destinies and good brothers. No matter how \r\nthe international situation changes, China will always \r\nstand firmly with its African brothers. We will always \r\nbe Africa’s most reliable and trustworthy friend. \r\nStrengthening unity and cooperation with African \r\ncountries has always been an important cornerstone of \r\nChina’s foreign policy. In his visit to Africa in March, \r\n2013, the Chinese President, Mr. Xi Jinping, put \r\nforward the guiding principle of sincerity, real results, \r\naffinity and good faith for China’s relations with \r\nAfrica, which provides an important guide to further \r\ndevelop the China-Africa relationship and cooperation. \r\nIn May, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang proposed the 461 \r\nFramework during his visit to Africa, which further \r\nenhances the level of cooperation between China and \r\nAfrica and deepens the new strategic partnership \r\nbetween the countries.\r\nSince the founding of the China-Africa Cooperation \r\nForum in 2000, China has actively cooperated with \r\nAfrican countries within the framework of the \r\nForum. By 2012, China had provided assistance to \r\n51 African countries and the African Union. In 2013, \r\nthe trade volume between China and Africa reached \r\n$220.2 billion. China has been Africa’s number one \r\ntrade partner for five consecutive years and China’s \r\ndirect investment in Africa has exceeded $25 billion. \r\nThe Chinese Government is actively implementing the \r\nassistance initiatives announced by President Xi Jinping \r\nand Premier Li Keqiang during their visit to Africa, \r\nwhich include extending to Africa $30 billion in credit \r\nover the course of three years, adding $2 billion to the \r\nChina-Africa Development Fund, providing $10 million \r\nto protect wildlife in Africa and implementing the \r\nTransnational and Transregional Infrastructure \r\nConstruction Corporation Partnership and the African \r\nTalents Programme. China will continue to support \r\nAfrican countries in their efforts to combat diseases, \r\nsuch as malaria and AIDS.\r\nThe Chinese Government has paid close attention \r\nto the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. At the \r\nbeginning of the year, when Ebola first appeared in \r\nsome West African countries, the Chinese Government \r\nimmediately extended a helping hand. In April, August \r\nand September, we provided the two affected countries \r\nwith humanitarian assistance totalling RMB 34 million, \r\nincluding supplies for prevention, control and treatment, \r\nfood and cash. We also dispatched nearly 200 experts \r\nand medical personnel to the affected areas to fight the \r\nepidemic with the people of those countries. \r\nWe are deeply worried about the worsening \r\nEbola outbreak in West Africa. Premier Li Keqiang \r\nannounced at the Asia-Europe Summit in Milan, Italy, \r\nthat China will provide to West African countries a \r\nfourth instalment of assistance worth at least RMB \r\n100 million, including 60 ambulances, 100 motorcycles, \r\n10,000 prevention and control kits and 150,000 units \r\nof personal protective gear. In addition, China will \r\ndispatch another group of dozens of experts and plans \r\nto train 10,000 health-care workers and community \r\nprevention and control personnel. As we speak, the \r\nEbola epidemic is still spreading in West Africa. We \r\nwill continue to stand together with West African \r\ncountries in this time of need, jointly overcoming the \r\ndifficulties, and will continue to combat the disease \r\nuntil we have secured a final victory.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating that China \r\nwill continue to support NEPAD and the African Union’s \r\nprogramme for 2063 and to make greater contributions \r\nto promoting the development and prosperity of Africa.\r\nMr. Menan (Togo) (spoke in French): My delegation \r\nwould first like to reiterate its congratulations to the \r\nPresident on his accession to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its current session and to offer \r\nhim its full support in his conduct of our work.\r\n18/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nIn today’s meeting of the Assembly, my delegation \r\n- which associates itself fully with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Malawi on behalf of \r\nthe Group of African States - would like to emphasize \r\nimplementation of the initiative to roll back malaria in \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly in Africa.\r\nSadly, malaria remains a serious public health \r\nproblem in Africa in general and in Togo in particular. \r\nIt is one of the major parasitic diseases in my country \r\nin terms both of morbidity and mortality, owing to \r\nclimatic conditions that are particularly favourable \r\nto the breeding of mosquitoes. It is the single largest \r\ncause of doctor visits, hospitalization and death in \r\nhealth facilities in the country. Children under five \r\nand pregnant women are its most vulnerable targets. In \r\n2013, for instance, approximately 881,600 cases were \r\nreported in Togo, of which 40 per cent were children \r\nunder five. Over the same period, 4 per cent of deaths \r\nrecorded in my country’s health facilities were related \r\nto the disease.\r\nThe heavy toll that malaria takes on African \r\nchildren continues to concern regional organizations, \r\nparticularly the African Union. In a declaration adopted \r\nat the Special Summit on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria held in Abuja, in July 2013, it asked member \r\nStates to take urgentsteps to reduce or eliminate \r\nchildren’s vulnerability, considering that we live in a \r\ntime when effective diagnostic tools and treatments are \r\navailable.\r\nFor its part, my country is implementing its third \r\nnational strategic anti-malaria plan, for 2011-2015, \r\nbased on meeting the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and on universal access to serious treatment \r\nof the disease. Our five-year plan is supported by the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \r\nin a project designed to strengthen universal access in \r\nTogo to malaria prevention and support services.\r\nWith the help of other partners, my country has \r\nbegun administring sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to \r\npregnant women, managing uncomplicated cases of \r\nmalaria with combination therapies based on artemisinin \r\nderivatives both in health facilities and the community, \r\nand routinely distributing insecticide-treated nets \r\nto the most vulnerable groups, including pregnant \r\nwomen and children under five. Since our 2005, 2006 \r\nand 2008 national campaigns for mass re-treating \r\nof ordinary household mosquito nets, we have added \r\ntwo national campaigns for distributing long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, one in 2011 and the \r\nsecond, most recent, in September 2014. They have \r\nenabled us to distribute about 4 million long-lasting \r\ntreated nets all across the country.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank all the technical and financial partners who \r\nhave continued to support Togo in the fight against \r\nmalaria. Our goal now is to increase the people’s use of \r\ntreated mosquito nets to at least 80 per cent, to ensure \r\ncomprehensive protection for pregnant women through \r\nintermittent preventive treatment, and to deal promptly \r\nand properly with every confirmed case of malaria. To \r\nachieve those goals, we need greater involvement on \r\nthe part of external partners, and my delegation calls \r\nurgently on them to strengthen the global partnership \r\nagainst endemic diseases and the optimal mobilization \r\nof financial resources that it requires.\r\nAt a time when our countries are working to improve \r\ntheir health systems, including by implementing \r\nprogrammes and strategies focused on the MDGs, the \r\nappearance in West Africa of the Ebola haemorrhagic \r\nfever virus has dealt a severe blow to the public health \r\nefforts of States dealing with limited resources. In the \r\nface of the spread of this epidemic, whose epicentre \r\nis unfortunately located in Liberia, Sierra Leone and \r\nGuinea, my country hopes very much that, as with the \r\nmobilization against malaria, the solidarity we have \r\nseen in the response to Ebola - demonstrated by the \r\ndispatching of health workers, financial contributions \r\nand the provision of materials and equipment - will \r\ncontinue and will lead to the establishment of more \r\nsustainable and efficient health-care systems. It is only \r\nthrough sustained and coordinated efforts that we can \r\nstop the progression of the epidemic in West Africa and \r\nprevent it from spreading around the world.\r\nMr. Chinyonga (Zambia): I would like to thank \r\nyou, Sir, for giving me the f loor in order to address \r\ntoday’s agenda item. \r\nZambia aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nearlier by the Ambassador of Malawi on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Group. \r\nZambia acknowledges the Secretary-General’s \r\nreports on the agenda item. They coincide not only \r\nwith the final stretch of the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, but also with the \r\nongoing deliberations on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, the sustainable development goals and the \r\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063.\r\n14-57494 19/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nWhile significant progress has been recorded \r\non various aspects of Africa’s development, as the \r\nSecretary-General’s reports suggest, a lot more must \r\nbe done to sustain and build on the gains recorded \r\nso far, especially in the area of health, which my \r\nstatement will focus on. The fight against HIV and \r\nother communicable diseases such as malaria and \r\ntuberculosis should therefore be intensified. At the same \r\ntime, the recently escalating danger of Ebola disease \r\nmust be controlled. In that regard, I should stress that \r\nmy delegation has already expressed its concerns in \r\nother General Assembly meetings during this session. \r\nEbola is a danger whose potential consequences should \r\nnot be underplayed in any forum.\r\nMalaria remains a major public health concern \r\nin Zambia. It disproportionately affects children \r\nunder the age of five, pregnant women and society’s \r\npoor and vulnerable members, and it imposes severe \r\nsocial and economic burdens on individual households \r\nand communities at large. My Government strongly \r\nbelieves that a malaria-free Zambia is possible. We have \r\nput policy and legal frameworks in place to ensure that \r\nthere are no obstacles to efforts to eliminate malaria in \r\nZambia. The Government has articulated that resolve \r\nin major national development policies, notably our \r\nnational health policy and our more specific national \r\nstrategic plan for malaria. The Government’s strategies \r\ninclude waiving taxes on the importation of malaria \r\ncommodities such as mosquito nets and the chemicals \r\nused in indoor residual spraying and increasing its \r\nbudget allocations for malaria programmes.\r\nCurrently, the main prevention interventions \r\ninclude indoor residual spraying, long-lasting \r\ninsecticide-treated nets and intermittent presumptive \r\ntreatment for pregnant women. The curative \r\ninterventions are based on prompt and effective case \r\nmanagement, which is primarily focused on providing \r\ncare for those suffering from malaria. A key component \r\nof that is the use of confirmatory diagnostic tools such \r\nas malaria rapid diagnostic tests and microscopy.\r\nZambia has made remarkable reductions in the \r\nincidence of malaria over the Decade to Roll Back \r\nMalaria, which has been attributed to the integrated \r\napproach of malaria control activities. To that end, \r\nmy country has leaned on the ambitious national \r\nmalaria strategic plan for 2011-2015, to which I alluded \r\npreviously.\r\nThe plan is envisioned to be implemented through \r\nthe use of surveillance as a type of intervention, in \r\ntandem with strengthening all other key interventions. \r\nIt hopes to increase access to potential victims through \r\nthe use of community structures by ensuring the \r\navailability of all required commodities and through \r\ncontinued monitoring and evaluation. Community \r\nhealth workers are critical to guaranteeing access to \r\nhealth care and to providing holistic and integrated \r\nmanagement of diseases including malaria, pneumonia \r\nand so forth. Further, the response involves using \r\ncommunity leaders and opinion makers in malaria \r\ncontrol activities.\r\nThe aforementioned measures have resulted in \r\nthe establishment of strong institutional structures by \r\nthe Government and its cooperating partners. Zambia \r\nhas joined and commends the linkages created at the \r\nregional and international levels through initiatives \r\nsuch as the joint regional malaria commemoration \r\nevents in the context of the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community Malaria Week, formation \r\nof regional networks to attain common goals in the \r\nprevention and control of malaria such as the Southern \r\nAfrica Regional Network, and the establishment of \r\ncross-border initiatives between countries in the region \r\nand beyond.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to underscore the overall \r\npositive impact created by the strong political will that \r\ncan be seen in the increased budgetary allocation for \r\nfunding malaria control and the forging of additional \r\nnew partnerships at all levels. In all the foregoing, we \r\nhave learned that scaling up the integrated package \r\nof cost-effective malaria interventions yields positive \r\noutcomes. We believe that with more collaboration, we \r\ncan do even better.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): My delegation \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Bolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, as well as the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Malawi on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States. Further, my delegation would like to \r\nexpress its appreciation to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening this meeting.\r\nIn addition, we would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his reports on the agenda item, as they \r\ncome at a critical time for us, with the target date for \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals fast approaching \r\nand as we prepare to enter the era of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. We see today’s meeting as an \r\nopportunity to review what has been done since 2000 \r\nand to align the post-2015 development agenda with \r\n20/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nAfrica’s own priorities going forward, as enshrined in \r\nAgenda 2063, an inspirational and aspirational vision \r\nof the Africa we want, and as outlined in the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). \r\nThat having been said, the international \r\ncommunity still needs to make every effort to meet \r\npast commitments aimed at assisting the continent in \r\nattaining its Millennium Development Goal targets. I \r\nalso wish to take this opportunity to acknowledge with \r\nappreciation the coordinating role being played by the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa, which has seen \r\nus engage in a very successful Africa Week, focusing \r\non regional collaboration within NEPAD and with \r\ninternational efforts through the United Nations. \r\nOur continent continues to make progress in \r\ninfrastructure development through the implementation \r\nof the Programme for Infrastructure Development \r\nin Africa (PIDA) and the Presidential Infrastructure \r\nChampion Initiative (PICI) chaired by South Africa \r\nand spearheaded by seven dedicated Heads of State and \r\nGovernment. The P1CI is part of the PIDA, as it is an \r\ninitiative to bring strategic political leadership to bear on \r\nfast-tracking the implementation of important projects \r\nfrom the PIDA Priority Action Plan by identifying and \r\ndealing with blockages, missing links and choke points. \r\nFor example, progress is being made in closing \r\nthe missing link of the trans-Saharan highway project \r\ncovering 4,500 kilometres between Algeria and \r\nNigeria, and $40 million has been secured towards its \r\ncontinued construction. It is expected to be completed \r\nin 2016. The fibre optic component of the same \r\nproject has seen substantial progress, having reached \r\n60 per cent of completion. Egypt recently held the first \r\nsteering committee meeting of the footprint States \r\nof the navigational route between Lake Victoria and \r\nthe Mediterranean Sea. Progress also continues to be \r\nmade along the North-South corridor with a number of \r\nhard and soft infrastructure issues and projects being \r\naddressed.\r\nOne of the key impediments that the Dakar \r\nFinancing Summit for Africa’s Infrastructure in June \r\n2014 revealed, however, is the need for extensive \r\nsupport in the area of capacity-building for project \r\npreparation. Projects have been identified and finance \r\nis generally waiting for bankable projects to emerge \r\nfrom the project pipeline, but the key bottleneck is \r\nthe ability to bring identified projects to the point of \r\nbankability. Africa urgently needs support to address \r\nthat key gap in the infrastructure development process.\r\nApart from infrastructure, the other key priority \r\nfor African development is agriculture. My delegation \r\nwould like to commend the African countries that have \r\nmet the target of allocating 10 per cent of national \r\nbudgetary resources to agriculture, in accordance \r\nwith the African Union Assembly decision taken in \r\nMaputo in 2003. Through the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme (CAADP), \r\nwe have also all committed ourselves to achieving a \r\n6 per cent growth rate in agricultural productivity per \r\nannum. Some 45 African countries are now engaged \r\nin the CAADP process, which is important because \r\nagriculture is pivotal to Africa’s transformation and \r\ndevelopment and in responding to poverty, hunger and \r\njoblessness. It is also important because it illustrates \r\nthe idea that Africa is committed to leading and taking \r\naction on its agreed priorities and actions. The role of \r\ninternational partners is to help scale up and accelerate \r\nAfrica’s own efforts. \r\nThe industrialization of agriculture by way of \r\nagroprocessing is the catalyst that will spearhead \r\nstructural transformation. Agroprocessing is one \r\ncomponent of a larger drive to beneficiate at the \r\nsource - to add value to our own resources rather than \r\nperpetually remaining suppliers of raw materials.\r\nThere is much more that can and must be done in \r\nthe health sector, however. In that regard, we would \r\nlike to emphasize the importance of increased long-\r\nterm investment in health technology and innovation. \r\nThe horrific crisis currently posed by the Ebola virus in \r\nWest Africa clearly illustrates the fact that it is in all our \r\ninterests to ensure that Africa has a strong health system. \r\nIt also clearly demonstrates the link between health \r\nand development, as the virus is proving devastating \r\nto the economies and social progress, particularly to \r\nthose of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, quite apart \r\nfrom the tragic loss of life. Therefore, we call upon the \r\ninternational community to rapidly increase all efforts \r\nto deal with the scourge of Ebola.\r\nNEPAD always made the point that it is a holistic, \r\nintegrated agenda that is premised on the idea that \r\nthere can be no development without peace and no \r\npeace without development. It is for this reason that \r\nwe continue to see Africa providing African solutions \r\nto African problems through mechanisms such as the \r\nAfrican Union Peace and Security Council and the \r\nAfrican Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises. \r\nEvery effort is being made by African leaders to ensure \r\npeace, security and stability in Africa, including by \r\n14-57494 21/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nputting troops on the ground and providing resources. \r\nIt is therefore crucial that we continue to strengthen \r\ncooperation between the United Nations Security \r\nCouncil and the African Union Peace and Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nIn order to foster and promote good political, \r\neconomic, social and corporate governance in Africa, \r\nwe remain committed to the African Peer Review \r\nMechanism. I am informed now that membership has \r\nrisen to 34 in 2014, and 17 countries have been reviewed \r\nto date. This system of self-assessment is unique in the \r\nworld in terms of its transparency and its scope, and the \r\nunderlying benefits cannot be overstated. We urge that \r\nsupport be given to countries that have been reviewed \r\nand have developed their national plans of action.\r\nIn conclusion, we are grateful to Mr. Ibrahim \r\nHassane Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer of the \r\nNEPAD Training and Coordination Agency, for all the \r\nwork that he and the Agency have done and continue \r\nto do. We all need to do more to support the work that \r\nhe and the Agency do in terms of coordinating and \r\nfacilitating the implementation of Africa’s identified \r\npriority programmes and projects as a key technical \r\nbody of the African Union.\r\nEqually, we need to ensure that all our efforts \r\nare aligned to, and in support of, the realization of \r\nAgenda 2063. We continue to appreciate the structured \r\napproach of the United Nations system to supporting \r\nthe implementation of NEPAD as the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment agenda of the African Union. In particular, \r\nthe ongoing work, advocacy, cooperation, coordination \r\nand support of the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica, the Economic Commission for Africa and \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme in that \r\nregard are much appreciated. Together we can — and \r\nmust — still achieve a great deal to attain the Africa \r\nwe all want and to establish and sustain growth and the \r\ngood story of Africa rising.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to say that it is a great privilege for me to speak \r\nat this meeting on the New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD) because, until very recently, I \r\nwas in Tokyo and deeply involved in the question of \r\nAfrican development through the process of the Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development \r\n(TICAD) and the elaboration of its framework for \r\ndevelopment assistance as Director-General for African \r\nAffairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I therefore \r\nfeel very fortunate and vindicated that our efforts \r\nthrough the TICAD process are duly and appropriately \r\ndescribed in the Secretary-General’s report on NEPAD \r\n(A/69/161). In paragraph 58, it is noted that the first \r\nministerial meeting of the fifth Tokyo International \r\nConference on African Development (TICAD-V), held \r\nin Yaoundé in May, endorsed a massive Implementation \r\nMatrix that includes 617 concrete projects and illustrates \r\nthe willingness and passion of the international \r\ncommunity to work for African development.\r\nTICAD-V, held in June, was not simply a \r\nconference about funds and figures. When I say “funds \r\nand figures”, I am referring to things such as Japan’s \r\ncommitment to provide an assistance package for \r\nAfrica of up to $32 billion, utilizing private and public \r\nresources, from 2013 to 2017, of which Japan is already \r\nimplementing the equivalent of roughly $6 billion. \r\nRather than focusing only on such funds and figures, \r\nmention must be made of the fact that TICAD-V \r\nmobilized our collective political will and developed \r\na robust policy framework to be shared by African \r\ncountries, Japan and the international community. That \r\npolicy framework acknowledges three basic priorities. \r\nFirst, infrastructure construction and human resource \r\ndevelopment are essential for African economic growth. \r\nSecondly, agriculture needs to be made profitable, which \r\nis to say that it needs to develop past basic subsistence \r\ntowards economic self-reliance - more farm-to-earn, \r\nrather than farm-to-eat. Thirdly, trade and investment \r\nin the private sector should be encouraged in addition \r\nto official development assistance.\r\nI am therefore delighted at the fact that those \r\npriorities are properly reflected in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report. I would like to express my appreciation \r\nfor the hard work of the Under-Secretary-General \r\nand Special Adviser on Africa, Ambassador Maged \r\nAbdelaziz, as well as the Chief Executive Officer \r\nof the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency, \r\nMr. Ibrahim Hassane Mayaki. In addition, I would \r\nlike to emphasize the importance of the roles that \r\nAfrica regional economic communities play in African \r\ndevelopment, which includes the achievement of peace \r\nand stability. In that connection, last month in New \r\nYork, Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a round-\r\ntable summit with the Chairs of the seven African \r\nregional economic communities on the improvement of \r\ninfrastructure in Africa.\r\nWe reaffirm another principle of TICAD-V: \r\nprolonged peace and stability are the fundamental \r\nprerequisites for socioeconomic development in Africa. \r\n22/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nAs described in the discussion of the causes of conflict \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General (A/69/162), there \r\nare several alarming cases of emerging or ongoing \r\nconflicts in Africa, in spite of the very important \r\nprogress that has been made throughout the continent \r\nas a whole. Japan shares the serious concern about those \r\nissues and is making its own efforts in that regard. For \r\nexample, Japan committed to providing $1 billion over \r\nfive years for development and humanitarian assistance \r\nin the Sahel region. We have already provided more \r\nthan $220 million. The loss of peace and stability, if \r\nthey are not properly restored, can potentially set back \r\nthe great strides in Africa’s development, making \r\nour goal of eradicating poverty more difficult and \r\nultimately becoming an enormous burden on society \r\ninternationally. That is to say that we must take rapid \r\naction to quell conflict, stem its deterioration and \r\nrestore peace and stability.\r\nI am greatly encouraged by the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, with its discussion of the causes of conflict and \r\nacknowledgment that African countries are enhancing \r\ntheir own efforts to tackle the issue. I would like to \r\nwelcome the robust efforts by the African Union and \r\nthe regional economic communities in the context \r\nof strengthening the African Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture. That effort illustrates African ownership, \r\nthe most fundamental principle of TICAD. Japan places \r\ngreat importance on the role of regional institutions in \r\nAfrican development in the area of peace and stability.\r\nI said that rapid action was very important, and \r\nthat is also applicable in the health sector. Japan \r\nbelieves that emerging health crises such as the current \r\nEbola outbreak in West Africa gravely jeopardize the \r\nwell-being and development of Africa and need to \r\nbe addressed immediately and with a sense of great \r\nurgency. At the high-level event on the response to the \r\nebola virus disease outbreak, held during the week of \r\nthe general debate at the sixty-ninth session, Prime \r\nMinister Abe pledged additional assistance totalling \r\n$40 million in order to reinforce measures already \r\nannounced. Japan has already allocated $22 million \r\nof that pledge to relevant international organizations \r\nand is now considering how to allocate the remaining \r\n$18 million.\r\nI would also like to touch upon another theme of \r\ntoday’s debate: malaria. We welcome the significant \r\nprogress made in responding to malaria in many \r\ncountries. At the same time, we are concerned about \r\nthe continuing high burden of the disease in a number \r\nof countries. Last year, Japan announced that it would \r\nmake a contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \r\nTuberculosis and Malaria in the amount of $800 million \r\nin the coming years, starting in 2014. We believe our \r\ncontribution to the Global Fund will strongly support \r\nAfrican countries’ efforts to fight malaria.\r\nI would like to conclude my remarks by expressing \r\nstrong appreciation and support for the activities \r\nof Africa Week. There are lots of themes and very \r\nimportant issues are being taken up, but I would like \r\nto stress the importance of resilience with regard to \r\nnatural disasters, including droughts and f loods in \r\nAfrica. Japan will host the Third World Conference \r\non Disaster Reduction, in March 2015. I would like to \r\ninvite attendance from all Member States, including \r\nAfrican countries, at the highest possible level.\r\nMr. Narang (India): It is a distinct honour for India \r\nto participate today in this important debate on the \r\ndevelopment and welfare of Africa.\r\nAs a common expression of the collective vision \r\nfor the socioeconomic development of Africa, the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nhas made commendable progress. India attaches high \r\nimportance to the main objective of NEPAD, which \r\nis to generate broad-based and equitable economic \r\ngrowth that allows Africa to reduce poverty and be \r\nbetter integrated into the global economy.\r\nAfrica has made impressive progress in achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), even \r\nthough progress remains uneven and halting. Many \r\nof the Goals and targets remain unmet, and a renewed \r\neffort and final push is required in the final year to \r\novercome challenges. As the international community \r\nnegotiates a new development agenda for the post-2015 \r\nperiod, it is time, we believe, for us to collectively \r\nrecommit ourselves to giving the highest importance \r\nto the interests of Africa. The needs and priorities \r\nof Africa must be at the centre of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nSustained and robust inclusive economic growth is \r\nindispensable for eradicating poverty, and is therefore \r\nalso a central policy objective. One of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports on this agenda item (A/69/161) shows \r\nthat aggregate African growth grew 1 per cent faster \r\nthan the global average in 2013. Furthermore, the \r\nAfrican Economic Outlook 2014 forecasts that economic \r\ngrowth in Africa will pick up to the pre-crisis level of \r\n6.5 per cent. That is welcome. Yet economic growth \r\n14-57494 23/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nwould need to pick up considerably for Africa to make \r\na sustained dent in poverty levels.\r\nTo sustain that growth momentum, continued \r\nand enhanced support to the NEPAD priorities by the \r\ninternational community is vital. Scaled-up investments \r\nin infrastructure, both economic and social, and in \r\nproductive capacity for industrial development are \r\nneeded. That is an area of priority for India’s partnership \r\nwith Africa as well.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General correctly points \r\nout that a strengthened and sustained global partnership \r\nis of critical importance for Africa to sustain recent \r\ndevelopment gains and accelerate progress towards \r\nreaching the MDGs. The commitments made by the \r\ninternational community must be met at the earliest \r\npossible time. While official development assistance \r\n(ODA) disbursements to Africa increased marginally \r\nin 2013, the share of Africa in ODA allocations remains \r\nunchanged, and the overall ODA levels, as we know, \r\nremain far short of the 0.7 per cent mark.\r\nThe issue of debt sustainability, which is at the \r\ncentre stage of discussions during this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, is of critical concern to Africa. \r\nInternational Monetary Fund analysis suggests that \r\nalmost 20 per cent of African countries are at a high \r\nrisk of debt distress. In that context, the mandate of \r\nresolution 68/304 for a multilateral legal framework \r\nfor sovereign debt restructuring processes acquires \r\nsignificance.\r\nThe debate today comes at a time when countries \r\nin Africa are confronted with what the World Health \r\nOrganization (WHO) has called the most severe acute \r\npublic health emergency in modern times. The serious \r\nchallenge and threat posed by the outbreak of the deadly \r\nEbola virus in West Africa requires urgent coordinated \r\naction by the international community.\r\nIndia has an established track record of participating \r\nactively in multilateral efforts to tackle public health \r\nemergencies, such as in our response to the HIV/AIDS \r\nissue a decade ago in Africa and Asia. In the current \r\ncrisis, India provided immediate financial assistance to \r\nthree of the affected countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia \r\nand the Republic of Guinea - and offered $500,000 to \r\nthe WHO to scale up its efforts. Subsequently, India has \r\nfollowed this up with a contribution of $10 million to \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Ebola Response Multi-Partner \r\nTrust Fund and an additional $2 million for the purchase \r\nof protective gear to tackle Ebola.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report on NEPAD \r\n(A/69/161) confirms the continued growth of Africa’s \r\nengagement and cooperation with India. Indian \r\ninvestment in Africa has expanded considerably \r\nand, as the report confirms, provides benefits to the \r\nAfrican economy in sectors as diverse as information \r\nand communication technologies, automobiles, \r\npharmaceuticals, engineering, energy and chemicals, \r\nto name but a few. Today’s India’s partnership with \r\nAfrica is multifaceted. What is more, that partnership \r\nis aligned with Africa’s own development priorities and \r\nroad maps.\r\nHaving grown at a robust 31.8 per cent annually \r\nbetween 2005 and 2011, India’s trade with Africa, \r\ncumulatively, was estimated to be over $72 billion in \r\n2013-2014. Indian investment in Africa is estimated \r\nto be over $35 billion. During the past decade, India \r\nextended more than $6.7 billion worth of concessional \r\nlines of credit to African countries, which in fact \r\ncomprises over two thirds of the total lines of credit \r\nextended by India. Thousands of African students and \r\nexperts have availed themselves of training facilities \r\nin India under various schemes, including the Indian \r\nTechnical and Economic Cooperation Programme last \r\nyear. During the same period, a number of capacity-\r\nbuilding institutions were set up, and several others are \r\nbeing set up.\r\nIndia has also been a steady contributor to the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security on the African \r\ncontinent since 1960. At present, over 6,500 Indian \r\npeacekeepers are deployed in Africa. Over the years, \r\nIndia’s committed participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping in Africa has helped many African \r\ncountries to cope with inter- and intra-State conflicts, \r\nweak institutions and collapsing economies, besides \r\nassisting in the resettlement of millions of internally \r\ndisplaced people.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to reiterate India’s abiding \r\ncommitment to deepen and strengthen its partnership \r\nwith Africa for the attainment of the development \r\npriorities identified by the African countries under \r\nNEPAD. India will also attach high importance to the \r\ninterests of Africa in the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nMr. Annakou (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis reports (A/69/161, A/69/162 and A/69/163) on the \r\nagenda items under discussion. I would also like to \r\nthank His Excellency Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz, \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Adviser on Africa, and \r\n24/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nthe Chief Executive Officer of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development (NEPAD) Planning and \r\nCoordination Agency for all the efforts that they are \r\nmaking on behalf of Africa. \r\nI would like to express the solidarity of my \r\ndelegation with the statement delivered earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of Malawi on behalf of the African \r\nGroup.\r\nNEPAD, which was launched more than a decade \r\nago, is one of the main instruments that emphasizes the \r\ncommitment of African leaders and countries to advance \r\nthe continent through a real partnership. That partnership \r\nwill realize the African vision as a progressive and \r\ndeveloped continent that provides a dignified life for \r\nits people and contributes to international peace and \r\nsecurity. Despite all the progress achieved over the \r\npast years in promoting development, economic growth \r\nand social development, thereby achieving many of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), the continent \r\nstill faces many obstacles and challenges preventing it \r\nfrom achieving others, especially in the fields of health, \r\nwater and sanitation and energy.\r\nIn view of the great challenges facing Africa - \r\nwhether in trying to achieve the remaining Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals or in achieving the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals that will constitute the focus of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda - Africa requires that \r\ndeveloped countries fulfil the commitments they made \r\nto it during the main conferences held by the United \r\nNations. Those commitments include supporting \r\nAfrican countries by helping them to achieve economic \r\nstability, attracting investment, with effective private \r\nsector involvement, and facilitating technology \r\ntransfer, notably in the field of poverty eradication, \r\nwhich remains a very pressing issue. Therefore, \r\nmore efforts should be made to increase agricultural \r\nproduction, in accordance with the Maputo Declaration \r\non Agriculture and Food Security, while reorganizing \r\npriorities and using technology and investment in \r\nagriculture to provide food for all the inhabitants of the \r\ncontinent in appropriate quantities and quality.\r\nWith regard to development, where the individual \r\nis the main instrument and goal, I would like to \r\nrefer to the grave health situation in Africa owing \r\nto the widespread existence of communicable and \r\nnon-communicable diseases, in particular the lethal \r\ndisease Ebola. Currently, some 10,000 people may \r\nbe infected weekly in West Africa. That means that \r\na great danger is really threatening Africans and may \r\nfind its way to other countries around the world, while \r\nAfrica, with its modest capabilities, cannot contain it. \r\nTherefore, it is imperative and urgent that we mobilize \r\nall our efforts and technologies to combat the epidemic \r\nbefore Ebola destroys the population of Africa and \r\nbecomes widespread all over the world.\r\nWith regard to peace and security in Africa, we \r\nneed to increase institutional cooperation, prevent \r\ndisputes, maintain peace, ensure human rights, achieve \r\ndisarmament and consolidate democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance in order to achieve political \r\nand economic stability in Africa.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to stress that \r\nLibya - despite the dire security situation and instability \r\nprevailing in our country, and with our economy and \r\ndevelopment coming to a standstill - would like to \r\nwork very effectively, once we recover, with African \r\ncountries to move NEPAD forward in order to achieve \r\nprogress, growth, and prosperity for African countries. \r\nWe would achieve that through coordination, joint \r\nwork and commitment by means of the cooperation \r\nconventions that have been signed with a number of \r\nAfrican countries. That will enable us to implement the \r\nremaining MDGs and prepare ourselves to achieve the \r\npost-2015 sustainable development agenda, especially \r\nsince Africa is very rich in young human resources and \r\nvast natural resources that will enable it, once they are \r\nput to good use, to achieve Africa’s ambitious vision \r\nof becoming a very progressive continent, one able to \r\ncontribute positively to the progress of humankind - its \r\nstability, happiness, prosperity and well-being.\r\nMr. Benhamadi (Algeria): At the outset, allow me \r\nto thank the President for convening this important \r\nmeeting and to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Ibrahim \r\nHassane Mayaki, Chief Executive Officer of the \r\nNew Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) \r\nTraining and Coordination Agency. Algeria welcomes \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on NEPAD \r\n(A/69/161) and the insights it provides. We also wish \r\nto thank the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa \r\nand its skilled and devoted team, headed by Under-\r\nSecretary-General Ambassador Maged Abdelaziz, for \r\ntheir valuable work in enhancing international support \r\nfor Africa’s development thanks to its advocacy and \r\nanalytical work.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of Malawi on \r\nbehalf of the African Group.\r\n14-57494 25/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nLaunched in Abuja in 2001 to spearhead the \r\nAfrican Renaissance, the idea of NEPAD was born \r\nout of the political imperative for Africans to rely \r\nprimarily upon themselves to lift the continent out of \r\npoverty and to bring to an end the marginalization of \r\nAfrica from the globalization process. For that purpose, \r\nNEPAD has placed the questions of peace, security, \r\ndemocracy, good governance, human rights, women’s \r\nempowerment and sound economic management at the \r\nheart of sustainable development. While recognizing \r\nthe political, economic and social difficulties that \r\nhave beset Africa’s development for decades, NEPAD \r\nis also the expression of Africa’s will to establish a \r\nnew partnership anchored in the principles of African \r\nleadership and, above all, ownership.\r\nAs the international community is about to embark \r\non the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nit is crucial that Africa be given special attention in \r\nthe process. For its part, over a year ago, the African \r\nUnion (AU) successfully adopted the Common African \r\nPosition (CAP) on the post-2015 development agenda. In \r\naddition to reaffirming the Rio principles, in particular \r\nthat of common but differentiated responsibilities, \r\nCAP also reiterates the principles of the right to \r\ndevelopment and equity, mutual accountability and \r\nresponsibility. CAP will also ensure a policy space for \r\nnationally tailored policies and programmes for Africa, \r\nincluding appropriate support for the implementation \r\nof NEPAD. Moreover, by adopting peace and security \r\nas its fifth pillar, in order to achieve sustainable and \r\ninclusive development that truly leaves no one behind, \r\nCAP also gives special attention to peoples living in \r\nStates experiencing or recovering from high levels of \r\nviolence.\r\nAfter a decade of implementation, NEPAD, as a \r\nprogramme of the African Union, has produced a number \r\nof encouraging results. The promotion of infrastructure \r\ndevelopment as a driving force for Africa’s integration \r\nand development led to the adoption in 2010 of the \r\nProgramme for Infrastructure Development in Africa \r\nby the AU Heads of State. \r\nWith respect to the implementation of the project \r\nchampioned by Algeria to complete the trans-Sahara \r\nhighway and gas pipeline, which would link Algeria \r\nand Nigeria, we are pleased to note that the securing of \r\n$40 million to finance the missing link of the highway \r\nproject, covering more than 4,500 kilometres, will \r\nallow the project to be completed by 2016. We also note \r\nwith satisfaction that the optic fibre component of the \r\nproject, linking Algeria, the Niger and Nigeria, has \r\nwitnessed substantial progress, with 60 per cent of the \r\nproject completed. Furthermore, significant progress \r\nhas also been made within the Comprehensive Africa \r\nAgriculture Development Programme (CAADP), \r\nwhich aims at achieving a 6 per cent growth rate in \r\nthe agricultural sector through the allocation of 10 per \r\ncent of national budgets. Today, 45 countries have \r\ncommitted themselves to CAADP, of which 39 have \r\nalready adopted a national agriculture investment plan.\r\nAlthough there has been progress in the past year in \r\naccelerating growth and social development, persistent \r\nchallenges, including limited progress towards the \r\nattainment of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), linger. Therefore, sustained international \r\nsupport will be crucial if Africa is to meet internationally \r\nagreed development goals, including and through a \r\nglobal partnership for development. To that end, we call \r\non development partners to pursue efforts to deliver on \r\ntheir commitments to Africa, including those relating \r\nto official development assistance, which witnessed a \r\ndecline of 5.6 per cent in 2013. All stakeholders need to \r\nmake a strong push in favour of Africa’s development, \r\nthe only region that is unlikely to attain the MDGs \r\nby 2015. In that context, we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the review of the implementation of \r\nthe commitments made towards Africa’s development \r\n(A/69/163), as it is likely to encourage efforts towards \r\ntheir full realization.\r\nWe know too well that the world’s prosperity cannot \r\nbe achieved without that of Africa. Africa’s efforts to \r\neradicate poverty and hunger, create jobs and ensure \r\nsustainable development must be complemented by \r\nsustained support from our international development \r\npartners. As the international community pursues its \r\nwork in defining the new agenda, ensuring that its \r\nefforts fully reflect African needs and priorities will \r\ngo a long way towards strengthening the continent’s \r\nprogress while consolidating its recent development \r\ngains.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, allow me to associate myself \r\nwith the statement made by the Ambassador of Malawi \r\non behalf of the African Group.\r\nI would also like to commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor the quality of reports being considered under the \r\nagenda items for this meeting (A/69/161, A/69/162 and \r\nA/69/163.\r\n26/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nWith regard to New Partnership for Africa’s \r\nDevelopment (NEPAD), we should emphasize that \r\ntoday’s debate takes place in a context marked by a \r\nbroad scope of various processes that impact Africa’s \r\ndevelopment. First, I should like to mention the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the work of the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals, which the \r\nreport rightly mentions, as do other reports concerning \r\nparticular situations in African countries, as does the \r\npolicy statement on African development needs and \r\nNEPAD. I should also note the publication of the report \r\nof the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing (A/69/315), which \r\nemphasizes the need to give substance to our financing \r\ncommitments, notably the funding of development in \r\nAfrica.\r\nThe Secretary-General emphasizes quite pertinently \r\nthat the publication of his report on NEPAD coincides \r\nwith the Dakar Financing Summit for Africa’s \r\nInfrastructure, held on 14 and 15 June, in which \r\nparticipants adopted the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa (PIDA) for financing priority \r\nregional infrastructure projects. He also mentions the \r\nsolemn declaration adopted at the twenty-first Summit \r\nof the African Union on 26 May to mark the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the organization, in which the main \r\npriorities for the development programme in Africa \r\nwere identified for the next 50 years, with particular \r\nemphasis on industrialization.\r\nAllow me to comment on two issues crucial to \r\nAfrica’s development, namely, infrastructure and \r\nindustrialization. The lack of infrastructure is one \r\nof the major challenges we face, in that it seriously \r\nundermines Africa’s integration and competitiveness \r\nin the global market. That deficit also mortgages \r\ndevelopment efforts and efforts to integrate Africa \r\nin socioeconomic and environmental areas. In that \r\nregard, my delegation welcomes the acceleration of the \r\nimplementation of the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa, launched in 2010 as a strategic \r\nframework for the development of infrastructure \r\nat regional and continental scales. Nevertheless, as \r\nastutely underlined in the Secretary-General’s report, \r\nthe financing of PIDA remains a challenge.\r\nIn that respect, I welcome the presidential initiative \r\non the NEPAD infrastructure. The initiative establishes \r\na model policy framework on interregional priority \r\ninfrastructure projects taken on board personally by \r\nseven African Heads of State and Government. In the \r\nsame spirit, the Dakar programme of action proposes \r\nspeeding up the implementation of pilot infrastructure \r\nprojects. Finally, I am pleased to highlight the \r\nAfrican Development Bank’s launch of the Africa 50 \r\ninitiative to mobilize more than $100 billion from the \r\npublic and private sectors to finance priority regional \r\ninfrastructure projects on the continent over the next \r\n50 years.\r\nWith regard to industrialization, my delegation \r\nconsiders it essential that the structural transformation \r\nof African economies will create added value \r\nand economic diversification. Industrialization \r\nis a powerful tool capable of generating inclusive \r\nand sustainable economic development leading to \r\nproductive employment and decent work and, finally, \r\nto lifting millions out of poverty.\r\nAs highlighted by several reports, the closed \r\nstructure of most African economies tends to \r\nconcentrate economic activity in the mining sector \r\nand the production of raw materials, without any real \r\nimpact on other sectors. In that context, with respect to \r\nsub-Saharan Africa, the report of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing notes that foreign direct investment is \r\nprimarily in the extractive industries, with limited \r\nimpact on the rest of the economy. That situation \r\ngenerates few jobs, as it directs wealth to those sectors \r\nrich in natural resources, promotes inequality and \r\ncontributes to social unrest.\r\nTo overcome that problem, Africa has no choice \r\nother than industrialization and building production \r\ncapacity. The recognition of that reality in Agenda \r\n2063 and in the report of the Open Working Group \r\non Sustainable Development Goals provides reason \r\nfor hope. Industrialization will help African countries \r\nstrengthen domestic resource mobilization through the \r\nestablishment of wealth and taxation systems, which in \r\nturn can help in achieving other development goals.\r\nIn view of the foregoing, national efforts to \r\nstrengthen the industrial fabric and continental \r\npriorities set out in the Programme for Infrastructure \r\nDevelopment in Africa should be supported.\r\nThe integration of NEPAD priorities into the \r\nnational development programmes of African countries \r\nis a cause for satisfaction. With particular reference to \r\nCameroon, several initiatives have been undertaken in \r\nthe past 12 months. I will mention just a few examples.\r\nWith regard to agriculture, a few months ago \r\nthe Government of Cameroon approved its national \r\nagricultural investment plan, which seeks to invest \r\n14-57494 27/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nmore than $6.5 billion in agricultural development \r\nover a seven-year period. Cameroon aims to mobilize \r\n58 per cent of that sum on its own, in accordance with \r\nthe Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme, which we signed on 17 July 2013. As part \r\nof the implementation of the Programme, the NEPAD \r\nAgency has partnered with Cameroon’s Dschang \r\nUniversity to conduct training and capacity-building \r\nin the management of agricultural risks in the Central \r\nAfrican subregion. Similarly, Cameroon is one of the \r\nsix countries that conducted a study on best practices \r\nin adapting agricultural systems to climate change. \r\nMoreover, in the area of gender, Cameroon is one of \r\nthe five African countries that launched a five-year \r\nprogramme to support efforts on gender, climate change \r\nand agriculture.\r\nWith regard to science, technology and innovation, \r\nCameroon has maintained its active role in Africa’s \r\nScience and Technology Consolidated Plan of Action, \r\nincluding through the African science, technology and \r\ninnovation indicators initiative, in which Cameroon is \r\none of the pioneers.\r\nWith respect to health, Cameroon is taking part \r\nin the second phase of the project to train nurses and \r\nmidwives in Africa, whose main objective is to improve \r\nthe skills of nurses and midwives at the graduate school \r\nlevel, and particularly the professional masters level.\r\nIn terms of subregional integration, on 21 and \r\n22 October 2013, Cameroon hosted the fifth session \r\nof the subregional coordination mechanism on United \r\nNations system support to the African Union and NEPAD \r\nin Central Africa. In those meetings, 116 projects were \r\napproved for the period 2013-2016 in the following \r\nareas: infrastructure development, governance, peace \r\nand security, industrial development, trade, market \r\naccess, agriculture and food security, science and \r\ntechnology, combating HIV/AIDS, employment, \r\ntraining and improving institutional frameworks for \r\ndevelopment.\r\nCameroon takes note of the Secretary-General’s \r\nanalysis of international support for African \r\ndevelopment. According to his report, “The response \r\nof the international community has been mixed”. \r\n(A/69/161, para. 52)\r\nWith regard to official development assistance \r\n(ODA), although preliminary figures indicate a 5 per \r\ncent increase in assistance to Africa, our continent \r\nreceives only 38 per cent of total ODA, a situation \r\nthat the Secretary-General said did not comply with \r\nthe declared commitment to prioritize Africa in \r\nthe distribution of such assistance. Moreover, the \r\ncommitments made at Gleneagles in 2005 by the Group \r\nof Eight to double the amount of assistance to Africa \r\nare far from being honoured.\r\nThe debt burden has gravely undermined the efforts \r\nof developing countries to achieve the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. Several initiatives have been \r\nimplemented to date to resolve that problem, such as the \r\nHeavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative (HIPC) \r\nand the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. Despite the \r\npositive impact of those initiatives, we share the view \r\nof the Secretary-General that debt forgiveness alone is \r\nnot a miracle cure for the development problems of the \r\nHIPC countries. While it is a necessary condition, it \r\nremains insufficient and requires additional assistance \r\nin both financing for development and capacity-\r\nbuilding.\r\nAfrica’s access to global markets and fair trade \r\nare of the highest importance for the continent. As \r\nmentioned in the Agreement Establishing the World \r\nTrade Organization (WTO),\r\n“there is need for positive efforts designed to \r\nensure that developing countries, and especially \r\nthe least developed among them, secure a share in \r\nthe growth in international trade commensurate \r\nwith the needs of their economic development”.\r\nFurthermore, international trade has been identified \r\nas one of the six fundamental areas whereby developing \r\ncountries can mobilize financing for development. The \r\noutcome document of Rio+20 refers to international \r\ntrade as a driver for development and sustained \r\neconomic growth. However, the current situation \r\nremains a matter of grave concern for Africa, which \r\naccounts for only 3 per cent of the global export market.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of the first multilateral \r\ntrade agreement, approved by the WTO on the \r\noccasion of the ninth ministerial conference held in \r\nBali in December 2013. We hope that provisions for its \r\nfacilitation will be beneficial for Africa on account of \r\nthe reduction in customs duties that might come from \r\nit. Nevertheless, my delegation remains of the view that \r\nthe Doha Round, the third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development and the post-2105 \r\ndevelopment agenda must guarantee a favourable trade \r\nsystem for development in order to reduce measures that \r\ndistort trade; improve the access of African products \r\nto markets; build trade capacity, including through \r\n28/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\nthe diversification of exports; and, finally, in order to \r\ndevelop intra-African trade.\r\nLet me conclude my remarks with a word about \r\nthe United Nations support for NEPAD. Cameroon \r\nwelcomes the strengthening of the regional coordinating \r\nmechanism of United Nations organizations and \r\nagencies working in Africa in support of the African \r\nUnion, NEPAD and the cluster system. It is encouraging, \r\nas recalled in the report of the Secretary-General, to \r\nsee that the fifteenth session of the mechanism, which \r\ntook place in March in Abuja, highlighted the need for \r\nall cluster groups of the mechanism to be aligned with \r\nthe strategic vision of the African Union, the strategic \r\nplans of NEPAD for 2014-2017 and Agenda 2063.\r\nCameroon notes, as indicated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in paragraph 17 of his report (A/69/163), that \r\nthere was insufficient time for the method used for \r\nthe first biennial review and therefore the method \r\nshould be revised in the future. In that regard, the role \r\nplayed by the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, \r\nfor which we reiterate our strong support, remains \r\ncrucial. Its strengthening, decided by resolution 68/247 \r\nA should, I am sure, help make it more effective in \r\ncarrying out its mandates. We have no doubt that it \r\nwill meet our expectations in implementing resolution \r\n66/293, in particular the satisfactory operation of the \r\nmonitoring mechanism to review the compliance with \r\nthe commitments made towards Africa’s development. \r\nAfrica Week - the whole week that has just past - has \r\nshown us all what the Office of the Special Adviser on \r\nAfrica can do. We thank it for its efforts.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 2011 (XX), of 11 October \r\n1965, and decision 56/475, of 15 August 2002, I now \r\ncall on the observer of the African Union.\r\nMr. Mayaki (African Union): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the African Union.\r\nI am pleased to warmly congratulate Mr. Sam \r\nKahamba Kutesa on his election as the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \r\nWe are confident that his tenure will witness global \r\nrecommitment to durable peace, inclusive development \r\nand cooperation.\r\nThe New Partnership for Africa’s Development \r\n(NEPAD) is central to the continent’s transformation \r\nefforts. African leaders have renewed the necessary \r\npolitical determination to help deliver the accelerated \r\nimplementation of NEPAD under the African Union.\r\nThe foundation for Africa’s renewal is premised on \r\nreforms of the governance systems under the African \r\nPeer Review Mechanism (APRM), created in 2003. The \r\nMechanism is the epicenter for deepening democracy \r\nand disseminating best practices among African Union \r\nmember States, thereby reflecting the commitment to \r\nimproving governance in all its ramifications.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThirty-four States members of the African Union \r\nhave voluntarily joined the Mechanism, 17 have been \r\npeer reviewed and the second cycle of the review \r\nprocess is ongoing.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAt the institutional level, the APRM is being \r\nre-engineered, with its integration into the African \r\nUnion and the development of stronger collaboration \r\nand synergy with relevant regional organizations and \r\nprogrammes. In that regard, the APRM secretariat \r\nhas been repositioned to effectively serve as Africa’s \r\npremier institution on governance.\r\nAs the technical body of the African Union, the \r\nNEPAD Agency focuses on the strategic coordination \r\nof the implementation of the continent’s priority \r\nprogrammes and projects. That role is now more \r\ncritical in the context of the African Union Agenda \r\n2063 and the African Common Position on the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nNEPAD continues to spearhead the implementation \r\nof the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development \r\nProgramme. With 2014 having been declared as the \r\nyear for transforming Africa’s agriculture and food \r\nsecurity, we are taking forward the Malabo Declaration \r\nadopted by the African Union Summit in June 2014 and \r\nforging a strategy for 2025. In addition to scaling up our \r\nefforts to increase agriculture investment financing by \r\nupholding the Maputo 10 per cent public spending target, \r\nwe have a strong accountability and results framework. \r\nIn collaboration with the African Union Commission \r\nand development partners, the NEPAD Agency is \r\nalso implementing the Climate-Smart Agriculture \r\nand Gender and Climate Change Support Programme. \r\nFurthermore, we have established the African \r\nClimate-Smart Agriculture coordination platform with \r\nregional economic communities, development partners \r\nand non-governmental organizations. The ultimate goal \r\nis to reach a target of 25 million farm households by \r\n2025.\r\n14-57494 29/30\r\n17/10/2014 A/69/PV.26\r\nInfrastructure development remains a critical \r\nenabler for sustainable and inclusive growth, while \r\nthe current economic landscape provides a unique \r\nopportunity to collectively address the infrastructure \r\ndeficit. Under the leadership of President Macky Sall \r\nof the Republic of Senegal and NEPAD Chair, the \r\nDakar Financing Summit for Africa’s Infrastructure \r\nwas convened in June. With the support of the African \r\nUnion Commission, the African Development Bank, \r\nthe Economic Commission for Africa (ECA), the World \r\nBank, the United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) and the Japan International Cooperation \r\nAgency, the landmark Summit inspired the mobilization \r\nof investment towards the construction of modern \r\ninfrastructure, starting with 16 identified projects \r\nfrom the Priority Action Plan of the Programme for \r\nInfrastructure Development in Africa.\r\nBased on the Dakar Agenda for Action and the \r\nPresidential Infrastructure Champion Initiative, chaired \r\nby President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, the NEPAD \r\nAgency is focusing on accelerating development \r\ncorridors and infrastructure project preparation \r\nin cooperation with the Africa50, operated by the \r\nAfrican Development Bank. The collective support of \r\nthe African private sector in Africa and worldwide is \r\nnecessary to effectively raise the required investment \r\nresources to implement the regional infrastructure \r\nprojects.\r\nOverall, the NEPAD Agency has continued \r\nits programmatic coordination by designing and \r\nimplementing the Science, Technology and Innovation \r\nStrategy for Africa for 2014-2024; and the African \r\nMedicines Regulatory Harmonization framework, \r\nwhich is aimed at increasing timely access to high-\r\nquality and efficacious medicines in order to boost the \r\nimplementation of the Africa medicine manufacturing \r\nplan.\r\nThe place for a new Africa in the global arena is \r\nvital to durable peace, stability, progress and security. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda can be catalytic to \r\nAfrica’s efforts only if the whole programming approach \r\nis informed by the understanding that development is a \r\nprocess of empowerment and self-reliance.\r\nBut key challenges still abound in Africa. A case \r\nin point is the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which \r\ncompels the imperative for united global action and \r\nsolidarity. A swift, collective and well-coordinated \r\npolicy response is vital, and we therefore welcome \r\nthe United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency \r\nResponse. That challenge shows us the importance \r\nof strengthening the capacity of the public health \r\nsystems in many African countries. The multisectoral \r\ndimensions of addressing public health issues, including \r\nmalaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and Ebola, cannot be \r\nover-emphasized.\r\nIt is in that context that the African Union will \r\nlaunch Agenda 2063 as a long-term strategy. Africa \r\ndevoted the past 50 years to defeating colonialism and \r\napartheid. The African Union believes that the next \r\n50 years should focus on structural transformation \r\nand inclusive development for socioeconomic change \r\nto happen. With seven aspirations prioritized, Agenda \r\n2063 is a call to action to fulfil Africa’s development \r\nobjectives.\r\nImportantly, Africa will be working with the \r\ninternational community on “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”. The overriding factor is that the new global \r\nagenda must support and complement Africa’s own \r\npriorities and development efforts. In particular, \r\nthe target of ending extreme poverty through a \r\nmultidimensional approach is critical for Africa and is \r\nfundamental to the implementation and delivery of a \r\nsecond decade of NEPAD.\r\nWe are convinced that structural economic \r\ntransformation will help defeat extreme poverty. The \r\nevolving commitment to strengthen the means of \r\nimplementation and build stronger global partnerships \r\nis a defining approach that NEPAD embraces. Recently, \r\nour leaders endorsed the establishment of the Africa \r\nGlobal Partnership Platform as an umbrella mechanism \r\nfor new and existing international partners of the \r\ncontinent.\r\nFinally, we appreciate the continued international \r\nsupport of Member States and agencies for NEPAD \r\nimplementation. The inspiring leadership and strategic \r\nsteering of the work of the United Nations by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon is commendable.\r\nWe welcome the United Nations monitoring \r\nmechanism, adopted by resolution 66/293, to review the \r\ndelivery of commitments to Africa’s development as a \r\nstep in the right direction. We commit to supporting the \r\nmechanism through the measures put in place by the \r\nOffice of the Special Adviser on Africa. Let me thank \r\nUnder-Secretary-General Mr. Maged Abdelaziz, as \r\nwell as ECA and UNDP, for their very strong support.\r\nThe NEPAD Agency and APRM, as key institutions \r\nof the African Union, recommit to sustaining the \r\npartnership and cooperation with the United Nations.\r\n30/30 14-57494\r\nA/69/PV.26 17/10/2014\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe transition that we will undergo as we move \r\nfrom the Millennium Development Goals to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda is an opportunity for Africa \r\nto renew its capacities to meet the challenges of the \r\ncontinent and our shared global challenges.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.55 p.m.\r\n"
