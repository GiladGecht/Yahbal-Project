"*1457849*\r\n14-57849 (E)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Gunnarsdóttir \r\n(Iceland), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nSport for development and peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/69/330)\r\nThe Acting President: Earlier this year, the \r\ninternational community commemorated the inaugural \r\nInternational Day of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nproclaimed by the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. This first commemoration was an \r\nopportunity to celebrate the many contributions of \r\nsport to peace and development. Indeed, the Assembly \r\nhas long recognized the virtues of sport as a means \r\nto promote education, health, development and peace. \r\nFrom 1993, with its resolution calling for the first time \r\non the observance of the Olympic Truce, to the 2004 \r\nproclamation of the First International Year of Sport and \r\nPhysical Education, the United Nations has continued \r\nto elevate the status of this important subject.\r\nThe 2005 World Summit Outcome Document \r\n(resolution 60/1) further underlined the potential of \r\nsport to foster peace and development and to contribute \r\nto an atmosphere of tolerance and understanding. This \r\nmessage was further reaffirmed in 2010 in the outcome \r\ndocument of the High-level Meeting on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, recognizing that\r\n“sport, as a tool for education, development \r\nand peace, can promote cooperation, solidarity, \r\ntolerance, understanding, social inclusion and \r\nhealth at the local, national and international \r\nlevels” (resolutiion 65/1, para. 67).\r\nFrom the first Olympic Games in Greece to the large \r\nsporting events drawing an international and diverse \r\naudience today, sport has always captivated the human \r\nmind. With its universal language, sport brings people \r\ntogether across cultural and political boundaries and \r\naround shared values of effort, solidarity and respect \r\nfor others. Sport not only promotes healthy lifestyles, it \r\nalso fosters perseverance, team spirit and inclusiveness.\r\nSince the Olympic Truce was first established in the \r\nninth century in Greece, we have seen many examples \r\nillustrating the role of sport in creating bridges between \r\ndivided communities, supporting reconciliation and \r\nfostering peace.\r\nOver the past two decades, the United Nations and \r\npartners worldwide have committed to mainstreaming \r\nsport into social policies. From the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme matches against poverty to \r\ninitiatives promoting gender equality in sport, from \r\nathletes speaking out against discrimination to the \r\ninclusion of people with disabilities, sport has proven to \r\nbe a powerful channel to promote development, poverty \r\neradication and social inclusion.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General before us \r\ntoday (A/69/330) describes many of these initiatives, \r\nundertaken by Member States and the United Nations \r\nsystem. I look forward to hearing members’ views on \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.28\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n28th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 20 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

By teaching respect \r\nfor the equality of people, tolerance and excellence \r\nthrough fairness, sport can have a positive impact on \r\nsocial inclusion and cohesion. This important potential \r\nhas to be harnessed.\r\nWe welcome the work of the United Nations aimed \r\nat mainstreaming sport in the policy agenda and \r\nenhancing its impact on development. In this regard, \r\nwe highly appreciate the work of the Special Adviser \r\nto the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke.\r\nWe recall the General Assembly’s landmark \r\nresolution 64/3, of 19 October 2009, which conferred \r\nobserver status on the International Olympic Committee \r\n(IOC). Under the able leadership of the IOC President, \r\nThomas Bach, himself an Olympic champion, we are \r\nwell placed to effectively promote the Olympic ideals \r\nand values.\r\nThe collaborative efforts of all relevant \r\norganizations and agencies, including the IOC, to \r\nenhance a policy-oriented and advocacy-focused \r\napproach, especially in the context of ongoing work \r\non the post-2015 development agenda, are of critical \r\nimportance.\r\nPolicies and partnerships are a critical requirement \r\nfor success at the national level as well. The Government \r\nof Azerbaijan has made the promotion of sport one of \r\nour national development priorities. This year we are \r\ncelebrating the twentieth anniversary of the Ministry \r\nof Youth and Sports, which was established within \r\n18 months of our independence. We have been steadfast \r\nin mainstreaming sport into our development strategies \r\nand in positioning our country as a sporting nation. In \r\naddition, our country has gained significant experience \r\nin hosting major events – not only at the European level, \r\nbut also at the level of world championships.\r\nPromoting sport as a means of education, health and \r\ndevelopment also fully corresponds with and underpins \r\nour State policy on youth. Today our population has a \r\nmedian age of 30 years. Youth make up 40 per cent of \r\nour population and remain our top priority. Targeted \r\npolicies to ensure inclusive recreation, sport and culture \r\nprogrammes are considered to be factors contributing \r\nto the success of our national youth team, which was \r\nranked among the top 10 teams at the Second Youth \r\nOlympic Games, held this summer in Nanjing, China.\r\nBuilding sporting infrastructure is central to \r\nproviding opportunities for exercise and physical health \r\nand to fostering a culture of sport in society. Over \r\njust the past 10 years, we have put in place more than \r\n50 world-class facilities throughout the country. That \r\nsporting infrastructure provides access to facilities to \r\nall our people at absolutely no cost. The opportunity to \r\nparticipate in sport at no cost has greatly enriched the \r\nlives of all of our people, including internally displaced \r\npersons (IDPs), the total number of whom remains \r\namong the highest in the world.\r\nIn April, our national Generations For Peace \r\nvolunteers, working with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and UNICEF, kicked off an \r\nawareness-raising initiative on the role of sport as a \r\ntool for peace to benefit vulnerable groups, including \r\nrefugees and IDPs.\r\nWe welcome the designation of 6 April as the \r\nInternational Day of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nin accordance with resolution 68/9. The Day has been \r\nincluded in the official calendar of the Ministry of \r\nYouth and Sport, and we have already held numerous \r\nsporting competitions in collaboration with various \r\nfederations and organizations.\r\nInternational sporting events are an important \r\npractical tool, not only for identifying talent and for \r\nwinning but also for facilitating dialogue, understanding \r\nand tolerance among nations. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to recall the remarks of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe eve of the Second Youth Olympic Games:\r\n“Sport has a very unique and extraordinary \r\npower to bring people together, to drive social \r\nchange and to bridge the gap between and among \r\ndifferent ethnicities and religions and people and \r\ntraditions – these are what the United Nations aims \r\nto promote and achieve.”\r\n14-57849 3/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\nThat view further cemented our own long-standing \r\ngoals and ambitions, and we are deeply committed \r\nto achieving those objectives. Over recent years, \r\nAzerbaijan has also positioned itself as a destination \r\nfor many sporting competitions. Along with world \r\nsporting events, regional sporting events are among our \r\ntop priorities. \r\nAt this time, our greatest challenge lies just 236 \r\ndays from now. It is my pleasure and honour to inform \r\nthe Assembly that our nation will host the inaugural \r\nEuropean Games from 12 to 28 June 2015. That was \r\na historic decision, as the continents of Africa, the \r\nAmericas and Oceania and Asia have a long history \r\nof continental games in their respective regions. In \r\nthat respect, we commend the visionary approach of \r\nMr. Patrick Hickey, President of the European Olympic \r\nCommittees. The population of our young independent \r\nnation welcomed the decision as a source of joy and \r\npride. Over the 17 days of competition in June 2015, \r\nmore than 6,000 athletes from Europe will compete in \r\n20 sports, in a spirit of peace, fairness, friendship and \r\nunity. While having had little more than two years to \r\nprepare for the Games, our country is determined to \r\ndo its best.\r\nWe place the utmost importance on that event \r\nand have nominated the First Lady of Azerbaijan and \r\nUNESCO Goodwill Ambassador Mehriban Aliyeva to \r\nlead our organization. It is with a great sense of honour \r\nand responsibility that the people and Government of \r\nAzerbaijan are working to make that event a success.\r\nIn observance of resolution 68/9, entitled “Building \r\na peaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal”, it is important and appropriate to \r\ncontinue to encourage Member States, especially \r\nin this era of new and global challenges, to observe, \r\nboth individually and collectively, the principle of the \r\nOlympic Truce during the inaugural European Games \r\nnext year.\r\nIn 2016, we will host the forty-second World \r\nChess Olympiad. In 2017, we will host the fourth \r\nIslamic Solidarity Games and, just last month, we were \r\nsuccessful in our bid to host the Union of European \r\nFootball Associations Euro 2020 tournament. We \r\nbelieve that such events will further strengthen \r\nfriendship, solidarity and intercultural dialogue, and \r\nwe are pleased and honoured to contribute in a truly \r\ntangible way to demonstrating the potential of sport \r\nto contribute to the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nI take this opportunity to encourage all Member \r\nStates to visit our country and see at first hand sport in \r\naction for development and peace.\r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia): It is a pleasure to see you, \r\nMadam, presiding over our meeting today.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank you, Madam, \r\nfor your statement, which in my view comprehensively \r\ncovers the major points that we will debate here today \r\nregarding the collective action carried out in the United \r\nNations system and elsewhere aimed at attaining our \r\nshared goals of using sport as a tool for promoting \r\ndevelopment and peace.\r\nI also wish to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nquality of his report entitled “Sport for development \r\nand peace: realizing the potential” (A/69/330), which \r\ngives a comprehensive overview of activities, including \r\nprogrammes and initiatives implemented by Member \r\nStates and by the funds and programmes of the United \r\nNations, specialized agencies and other partners, \r\nincluding the Olympic Movement. We welcome the \r\nactivities undertaken by the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the Office on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, over the past year.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the tireless and continuous efforts of \r\nMr. Wilfried Lemke, Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace, and we \r\npledge our full support to his Office’s efforts to ensure \r\nthe success of sport promotion programmes throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nSport is traditionally regarded as a key element \r\nin establishing the norms of responsible behaviour \r\nin a society, playing thereby a very special role in \r\nmaintaining a healthy social fabric. It goes without \r\nsaying that access to sport is a fundamental social right \r\nand a factor in social integration and development, as \r\nwell as a tool for promoting exemplary values and a \r\nsolid education for our children and young people.\r\nI would therefore like to reiterate the determination \r\nof Tunisia to continue in its efforts to make sport, \r\nby virtue of its potential for communication and \r\nreconciliation, a powerful vector for integration and \r\ndevelopment at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels, and a way to promote solidarity, tolerance and \r\nthe richness of cultural and human diversity.\r\n4/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\nI would also like to express our appreciation for the \r\ninterest shown by all Member States in sport and for \r\ntheir commitment to its universal character as a tool for \r\npromoting peace, development, education and health.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to welcome the \r\ncommemoration on 6 April of the first International \r\nDay of Sport for Development and Peace. The Day \r\nserved as an opportunity to promote, at the global \r\nlevel, the role of sport in promoting a peaceful society \r\nand the use of sport and physical activity as tools for \r\ndevelopment and peace.\r\nI take this opportunity to welcome the signing in \r\nApril of the memorandum of understanding between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Olympic \r\nCommittee calling for the strengthening of efforts \r\nto promote sports-related initiatives that encourage \r\neconomic and social development and for increasing \r\nthe number of partnerships agreed among various \r\nUnited Nations bodies and the International Olympic \r\nCommittee.\r\nI also welcome the success of the Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games held in Sochi, which consolidated \r\nthe observance of the Olympic Truce and the ideals of \r\nthe United Nations and the Olympic Movement, namely, \r\nfriendship among peoples, harmony, non-violence and \r\nnon-discrimination. The Games also clearly highlighted \r\nthe unifying nature of sport and its catalysing character, \r\ngenerating friendship and sportsmanship among \r\nathletes and fans, whatever their origins, affiliations or \r\nbeliefs. I would also like to thank Brazil, the Republic of \r\nKorea and Japan for their commitments to host the next \r\nOlympic Games in 2016, 2018 and 2020, respectively.\r\nGiven the noble nature of sport and its vital \r\ncontribution to the emergence of new generations eager \r\nfor good physical and mental health, Tunisia wishes to \r\ntake this opportunity to urge Member States to ensure \r\nthat education on sports ethics is disseminated among \r\nyoung people through the educational system and \r\nthrough associations and organizations of civil society, \r\nso that arenas and sports events are not used for the \r\nexpression of slogans drawn from the lexicon of racism, \r\nxenophobia and the rejection of the other.\r\nIn order to continue the current momentum and to \r\nmake sport a means for promoting universal principles \r\nin the service of future generations, my country \r\nreiterates its willingness to work with all stakeholders \r\nto advance the noble values  of sport as a means of \r\nbringing together cultures, fostering social inclusion \r\nand achieving the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the post-2015 development agenda currently being \r\nnegotiated in this forum.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): This \r\nyear has seen two high-level events – in the Russian \r\nFederation, the XXII Winter Olympic Games and \r\nthe XI Paralympic Games in Sochi, and in Brazil the \r\nInternational Federation of Association Football World \r\nCup – that were able to bring the world together to share \r\nthe passion and friendship that only sports can make us \r\nfeel. The feat of self-transcendence and the power of \r\nsport prevailed in that context and were able to offer, if \r\nonly for a moment, an opportunity to realize something \r\nto which we all aspire in this Hall – the values  and \r\nprinciples that unite us.\r\nWith that in mind, the first observance of the \r\nInternational Day of Sport for Development and Peace \r\nwas also held this year. In many cities, events were \r\norganized to highlight the power of sport to transcend \r\nour differences, promote tolerance and understanding \r\nand set the target of the inclusion of all. The active \r\nparticipation of United Nations agencies such as the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and UNESCO, \r\nas well as messages from the United Nations Office \r\non Sport for Development and Peace, summarized the \r\npower of sport in the following terms: respect and the \r\npromotion of dialogue and non-discrimination; the \r\npreparation of children and young people for life; the \r\nability to include everyone, regardless of their abilities; \r\nachieving equality between the sexes; and improving \r\nphysical and mental health. \r\nIn Monaco, the Department of National Education, \r\nYouth and Sport, in close partnership with the Princess \r\nCharlene of Monaco Foundation and the Peace and \r\nSport Organization, organized the Princess Charlene of \r\nMonaco Rally, which consisted of two sporting events \r\nand one intellectual event and brought together 400 \r\nstudents, who competed in the spirit of teamwork and \r\nsolidarity, testing their endurance.\r\nThe first celebration of the International Day was \r\nalso an opportunity for the signing of a memorandum \r\nof understanding to strengthen the already strong \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC), a collaboration \r\ndesigned to take advantage of the potential of sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace. We share the convictions of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee and its goal of placing \r\nsport in the service of the harmonious development of \r\n14-57849 5/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\nhumankind with a view to promoting a peaceful society \r\nconcerned with the preservation of human dignity.\r\nI would therefore like to officially welcome \r\nthe appointment of Mr. Jacques Rogge, former IOC \r\nPresident, to the position of Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General for Youth Refugees and Sport. \r\nSport as a tool to empower young displaced people \r\nand refugees can contribute to prospects for peace and \r\nreconciliation, but also to health, education, gender \r\nequality and social inclusion in battered communities. \r\nRecognizing the role played by sport in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals will lead us, as of next \r\nyear, to give sport the place it deserves in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, emphasizing, in particular, its \r\nmultidimensional impact and taking into account the \r\nUnited Nations Action Plan on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace.\r\nAt the national level, the Principality of Monaco \r\nfocuses on various areas where sport and physical \r\nactivity can contribute to development. These \r\ninclude sport and health, by educating students about \r\nAlzheimer’s disease through a walk in partnership \r\nwith the Monegasque Association for Research \r\non Alzheimer’s Disease; sport and prevention, by \r\nestablishing lifeguard and first-aid training in sports \r\nand physical education classes taught by instructors \r\nfrom the Monaco Training Centre for First Aid and \r\nWater Rescue; sport and disability, by educating \r\nstudents about accessibility for people with disabilities, \r\nfocusing on interaction through sport with young adults \r\nwith disabilities; and, finally, sport and childhood, \r\nby giving students the opportunity to participate in \r\nno-finish-line running in physical education and sport \r\nclasses, in partnership with the Monegasque Children \r\nand Future Association, in order to raise funds for the \r\nassociation. Monaco remains convinced that sport as a \r\nvector of values , opportunities and openness can make \r\na crucial contribution to giving needy children access \r\nto a healthy lifestyle, while promoting their integration \r\ninto their community.\r\nUNICEF’s efforts that focus on the integration of \r\nsports and games into the country programmes warrant \r\nour support. Its regional initiative “Vamos jugar” in \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean puts to good use the \r\nmomentum from the World Cup 2014 and the upcoming \r\nOlympic Games in 2016 in encouraging communities \r\nto provide sports facilities that are safe and accessible \r\nto all.\r\nThe twenty-fifth anniversary of the International \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child will certainly \r\nprovide a unique opportunity to promote such \r\nprogrammes. In that spirit, Monaco’s Department of \r\nNational Education, Youth and Sport will organize on \r\n20 November, which is the anniversary of the adoption \r\nof the Convention, a symbolic march for the children of \r\nthe world.\r\nIn concluding my statement, I would like to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General and the Special Adviser and his \r\nOffice for their leadership.\r\nMr. Roet (Israel): On behalf of the State of Israel, I \r\nwould like to thank the United Nations Special Adviser \r\non Sport for Development and Peace, Mr. Wilfried \r\nLemke, for his tireless work in fostering dialogue and \r\npartnership.\r\nIsrael believes that sport nurtures mutual \r\nunderstanding and coexistence and is therefore proud \r\nto co-sponsor the related draft resolutions.\r\nThere are countless examples of the way in which \r\nsport can foster peace and enable development. From \r\nCosta Rica to Cameroon and from New York to New \r\nDelhi, sport is building bridges between people \r\nfrom different countries, cultures and communities. \r\nThroughout the world, disputes and disagreements are \r\nbeing set aside and common ground is being found \r\non dusty lots and inside grand stadiums. By playing \r\ntogether, people learn from one another, and in the \r\nprocess greater understanding is fostered.\r\nIn August, some 80 Israeli and Palestinian students \r\narrived for this season’s opening training session at \r\nthe Peres Center for Peace football programme. Just a \r\nfew days after the summer conflict between Israel and \r\nHamas in Gaza ended, Israeli children and Palestinian \r\nchildren came together to play football. The coach of \r\nthe Palestinian squad, Ahmed Al-Jericho, said, \r\n“Our children think only of football. They love to \r\nplay football. They do not care if it is with Jews or \r\nnon-Jews. They are kids, and all they care about is \r\nliving together in peace.”\r\nThousands of children from all backgrounds and \r\nreligions overcome the barriers of language and culture \r\nthrough programmes like the Peres Center’s football \r\nprogramme. Former Israeli President Shimon Peres, for \r\nwhom the Center is named, said:\r\n6/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\n“You will spread word of the games and of peace \r\n– shalom, salaam – instead of confrontations. \r\nEveryone loves to play football, regardless of \r\nreligion or nationality. You need peace and you will \r\ncarry the message of peace.”\r\nNowhere is that more evident that on Israel’s national \r\nsports teams, where Jews, Arabs, Muslims and \r\nChristians all share the same uniform. They play \r\ntogether, win together and lose together. That is the \r\npower of sport.\r\nThe same power can be seen in Rwanda. The \r\ncountry is known as the land of 1,000 hills, and every \r\nhill seems to hold a 1,000 cyclists delivering food, \r\nfirewood and coffee. Travelling through the country, \r\none sees that many of the bikes were fashioned out of \r\nsimple planks of wood. Ten years ago, a charity called \r\nProject Rwanda began providing thousands of new \r\nbikes to Rwandans. The organization also established \r\nan annual race that drew hundreds of people from \r\ndifferent tribes to ride together. A movement was born, \r\nand 2007 saw the creation of the first Rwandan national \r\ncycling team, composed of both Hutu and Tutsi riders. \r\nThey have proven the power of sports to unite people \r\nand overcome ethnic and cultural differences.\r\nWhile sport should be immune to politics and \r\nimmune to racism, that has not always been the case. \r\nDuring the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, which \r\nfeatured the slogan “The Happy Games”, Palestinian \r\nterrorists killed 11 Israeli athletes, coaches and referees. \r\nUnder the interlocking rings of the Olympic banner, \r\nhostility took the place of international harmony. The \r\nmemory of that dreadful day is still fresh in my mind. \r\nAs a young boy, sport was to my mind magical, and the \r\n“Happy Games” were the high point that I had been \r\nanticipating for weeks. After the Munich massacre, \r\nsports and the Olympics were never the same in my \r\nmind.\r\nI am sad to say that not enough has changed \r\nsince then. Israeli athletes still have to contend with \r\ndiscrimination. This year, our tennis players were \r\nexcluded from a tournament in Dubai; athletes from \r\nTunisia, Kuwait and Iran refused to participate in \r\nfencing and judo tournaments with Israelis; and one of \r\nour soccer teams was attacked by a mob that stormed \r\nthe field during a friendship match in Austria. For sport \r\nto be a tool that can better the world, we cannot ignore \r\nthe racism and hate that sometimes erupts in arenas \r\nand stadiums. Whether it is racist chants, taunts, ugly \r\ngestures or the racist “quenelle” salute, there must be a \r\nzero-tolerance policy towards racism. There is no room \r\nfor any sort of prejudice, politics or racism in sport. It is \r\nour duty to protect and promote the fundamental values \r\nof teamwork, fairness and mutual respect. Let us work \r\ntogether to cultivate a culture that unites us rather than \r\ndivides us.\r\nMr. Stone (Australia): Australia is committed to \r\nthe principles of sport for development and peace and to \r\nthe role that the United Nations can play in furthering \r\nthose principles. We welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the subject (A/69/330) and would like once \r\nagain to thank the Secretary-General’s Special Adviser \r\non Sport for Development and Peace, Mr. Wilfried \r\nLemke, for his ongoing efforts to promote the United \r\nNations work in the field of sport for development and \r\npeace. We would also like to thank Monaco and Tunisia \r\nfor co-chairing of the Group of Friends of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace and for their facilitation of the \r\nbiennial draft resolution (A/69/L.5), which Australia is \r\npleased to co-sponsor.\r\nSport’s popularity, its capacity as a communication \r\nplatform and its ability to connect people, both within \r\nand between communities, make it a tool that can \r\nbe used to meet a range of development challenges, \r\nincluding meeting the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nAustralia, with a reputation as a sporting nation, is well \r\nplaced to use sport as a vehicle to contribute to targeted \r\ndevelopment outcomes. Over the past five years, the \r\nAustralian Government has committed $49 million to \r\ndevelopment through sports programmes. Our approach \r\nto sport for development first identifies development \r\nchallenges, and then determines how sport-based \r\nactivities can help meet those challenges. In the \r\nPacific, working in partnership with Governments and \r\nnon-governmental organizations, we have identified \r\nnon-communicable disease prevention and enhancing \r\nthe lives of people with disabilities as priority areas.\r\nThe Australian Sports Outreach Programme works \r\nin seven Pacific countries to deliver grass-roots level \r\nsports programmes in those priority areas. Recently \r\nreleased independent research on the Programme, \r\ncommissioned by the Australian Government, \r\nprovides compelling evidence of the value of sport as \r\na development approach. In Vanuatu and Nauru, sport \r\nprogrammes are contributing to greater inclusion of \r\npeople with disabilities in community life by helping \r\nto build the confidence and self-esteem of people with \r\ndisabilities, providing opportunities for them to interact \r\nwith their families and communities, and contributing to \r\n14-57849 7/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\nbreaking down barriers and changing negative attitudes. \r\nCommunity activities are being modified to encourage \r\ngreater participation by children with disabilities. \r\nChildren are motivated to join the programmes after \r\nseeing other children with disabilities playing sport and \r\nbeing encouraged by parents, friends and volunteers. \r\nAs a result, the children have increased their self-\r\nefficacy and confidence and have expanded their social \r\nnetworks. The parents and caregivers of children with \r\ndisabilities have described an increase in awareness of \r\ntheir children’s capabilities after watching them play \r\nsports. For some parents, that meant that they felt more \r\nengaged with their childen. All parents believed that \r\nvillage attitudes had changed for the better, once people \r\nsaw children with disabilities playing alongside those \r\nwithout.\r\nTo combat non-communicable diseases, the \r\nAustralian Sports Outreach Programmes in the Pacific \r\nhave promoted an increase in physical activity through \r\nparticipation in sport. The evidence presented from \r\nresearch indicates that when used strategically, sports \r\nprogrammes can make a measurable contribution \r\nto reducing some of the major risk factors of \r\nnon-communicable diseases by making people aware of \r\nthe risks of physical inactivity and providing them with \r\nopportunities to be more physically active, which has \r\na positive impact on other health-related behaviours, \r\nsuch as improved diets and reduced smoking and \r\ndrinking. The research has also shown the importance \r\nof getting women involved in community-based sports \r\nprogrammes. Research has shown that vegetable \r\nconsumption has increased and the consumption of \r\ntobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks has decreased. That \r\nis an important finding, given the key role that women \r\nplay in Pacific households.\r\nAlong with non-communicable disease prevention \r\nand enhancing the lives of people with disabilities, the \r\ndevelopment through sport programmes also play a \r\nrole in improving social cohesion by bringing people in \r\ncommunities together in a positive way and by positively \r\nengaging young people and helping them learn \r\nimportant life skills, including leadership, teamwork, \r\nrespecting rules, discipline and perseverance.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): It is an \r\nhonour and a privilege for me to take part in today’s \r\ndebate. At the outset, I would like to welcome the \r\nefforts made by Her Excellency Ms. Isabelle Picco, \r\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative of Monaco, \r\nand His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, \r\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative of Tunisia, \r\nas co-facilitators of the draft resolution on sport as a \r\nmeans to promote education, health, development and \r\npeace (A/69/L.5). We are also pleased to co-sponsor that \r\ndraft resolution, which we hope the General Assembly \r\nwill adopt by by consensus.\r\nSince the dawn of human civilization, sport has \r\nalways contributed in a significant way to resolving \r\ndifferences and bringing together points of view and \r\ncountries. Sport has a unique ability to attract, mobilize \r\nand inspire people around the world. It knows neither \r\ngeographic nor social boundaries. It is a powerful factor \r\nfor social inclusion and f lourishing, which makes it \r\npossible to strengthen relationships and to promote \r\nthe ideals of peace, fraternity, solidarity, non-violence, \r\ntolerance and justice. Sport is also a highly effective \r\ntool for achieving development goals in the areas of \r\nhealth, education, development and peace.\r\nMorocco would like to pay a special tribute to all \r\nthe international organizations that promote the role of \r\nsport around the world and welcomes the actions of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee and the International \r\nParalympic Committee to promote and strengthen \r\na culture of peace based on the spirit of the Olympic \r\nTruce.\r\nMy delegation also welcomes the declaration by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of 6 April as the International Day of \r\nSport for Development and Peace, aimed at marking the \r\ncontribution of sport and physical activity to education, \r\nhuman development, healthy lifestyles and the building \r\nof a peaceful world.\r\nAt the national level, my Government has \r\ndeveloped a national policy in the field of sport and \r\ndevelopment. Since 2008, Morocco has had a new \r\nstrategy in place to anchor sporting practice and its \r\nvalues in the daily lives of our citizens, confirm that \r\nsport is a fundamental right and an important element \r\nof social integration, and expand access to sport, while \r\nboosting sports associations. That reflects the steadfast \r\nwill of His Majesty the King to give strong impetus to \r\ndevelopment dynamics by using sport as a fundamental \r\nelement for the development of the personal skills \r\nand abilities of young people, who have always been \r\namong the strategic priorities for the Kingdom in \r\nterms of education, training, access to labour markets, \r\nparticipation in political life and contributions to \r\neconomic, social and cultural fields.\r\n8/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\nSince his accession to the throne, His Majesty \r\nKing Mohammed VI has paid great attention to sport \r\nin its various forms, launching numerous sports \r\ninfrastructure projects and contributing to the overall \r\ndevelopment dynamics of the Kingdom. During a \r\nnational sport conference held in October 2008, the \r\nMoroccan sovereign designated sport as a fundamental \r\nright:\r\n“Today, sport is becoming one of the fundamental \r\nrights of humankind. It is therefore necessary to \r\nexpand access to sport for men and women from \r\nall sections of society, without distinction, in all \r\nregions and disadvantaged areas, and to include \r\npersons with special needs. Sport is, as such, a \r\nstrong lever for human development, inclusion, and \r\nsocial cohesion and for fighting against poverty, \r\nexclusion and marginalization.”\r\nAs a result of the royal interest in the development \r\nof sport, Morocco today has the right to be proud to be \r\none of the few countries in the world whose Constitution \r\nenshrines sport as a right of citizenship and a lever for \r\nhuman development in harmony with the profound \r\nchanges in the country in various political, economic \r\nand social fields.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate my delegation’s \r\ncommitment to strengthening, through sport, \r\ninternational brotherhood, friendship, goodwill \r\nand unity among peoples, for there is no better way \r\nthan sport to inculcate and encourage the values of \r\nrespect, diversity and tolerance between communities, \r\ncivilizations and cultures. In addition, peace and \r\nnon-violence are among our core values.\r\nMr. Gupta (India): On behalf of the delegation \r\nof India to the United Nations, it is my honour and \r\nprivilege to participate in this debate today and share \r\nour views on agenda item 11, entitled “Sport for peace \r\nand development”.\r\nAt the outset, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ncomprehensive report on the subject (A/69/330) and \r\ncompliment all Member States and entities of the \r\nUnited Nations system for taking concrete steps to \r\npromote sport for development and peace since the \r\nprevious report, in 2012.\r\nIndia welcomed the observance of the first \r\nInternational Day of Sport for Development and Peace \r\non 6 April this year. We firmly believe that that new \r\ncommemoration on the international calendar will \r\nfurther promote sport as a catalyst for bringing us \r\ntogether.\r\nThe United Nations in its annual reports has \r\nconsistently highlighted that participation in sport is a \r\nfundamental human right and is essential to the healthy \r\ndevelopment of children. Sport is about participation, \r\ninclusion and bringing people together by highlighting \r\nwhat they hold in common. Sport offers us an avenue \r\nto learn skills such as discipline, confidence and \r\nleadership. Tolerance, cooperation and respect for others \r\nare also fostered through the positive interaction that \r\nwe experience. In addition, sport empowers individuals \r\nand helps foster self-esteem. We therefore believe that \r\nsport can bring people together towards a common \r\ngoal, while promoting respect and cooperation, and at \r\ntimes even facilitating the resolution of conflicts with \r\nlasting peace.\r\nThe father of our nation, Mahatma Gandhi once \r\nsaid:\r\n“When we play, we make mistakes, and when we \r\nmake mistakes, we learn. Freedom holds no value \r\nunless we have the freedom to err.”\r\nAgainst that backdrop, the exemplary work being \r\ndone by Coaches across Continents deserves special \r\nmention. The innovative use of football in Uganda to \r\nreintegrate former child soldiers into their communities \r\nby teaching them life skills, health, wellness, education, \r\nempowerment and conflict resolution is indeed \r\npraiseworthy. That allows for rehabilitating interaction \r\namong them and enables them to seek a solution \r\ntogether as a team, without the use of violence.\r\nThe recognition by the United Nations of sport as a \r\nfundamental human right is the right step forward, given \r\nits enormous positive impact on health, not only for \r\nchildren but also for adults. The rise of obesity and the \r\nspread of lifestyle diseases, particularly cardiovascular \r\ndiseases and diabetes, make participation in physical \r\nactivity a critical necessity.\r\nIndia is going through a period of rapid urbanization \r\nand a consequent loss of open green spaces. Against \r\nthat background, fostering a culture of healthy lifestyle \r\nthrough regular physical exercise is also recognized by \r\nour Government as a national health priority. In that \r\nregard, the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra \r\nModi, in his address to the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session stated:\r\n14-57849 9/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\n“We need to change our lifestyles. Avoiding energy \r\nuse is the cleanest option and would give a new \r\ndirection to our economy. For us in India, respect \r\nfor nature is fundamental and an integral part of \r\nspiritualism … Today, I would like to underscore \r\nthat yoga is an invaluable gift from our ancient \r\ntradition. Yoga embodies unity of mind and body, \r\nthought and action. It is important to coordinate all \r\nof those aspects. Such a holistic approach is valuable \r\nto our health and our well-being. Yoga is not just \r\nabout exercise; it is a way to discover the sense \r\nof oneness with oneself, the world and nature. By \r\nchanging our lifestyle and creating consciousness, \r\nit can also help us deal with climate change. Let us \r\nwork towards adopting an international yoga day.” \r\n(A/69/PV.15, p. 18)\r\nWhile India is considered to have been the birthplace \r\nof innumerable sports since ancient times, yoga offers \r\na holistic approach to health and well-being globally \r\nand is one of the several concrete manifestations \r\nof globalization that, through the exchange of best \r\npractices, promote better individual lifestyles that are \r\ndevoid of excesses of all kinds. The Indian delegation \r\nhas since initiated steps to have 21 June declared as \r\nthe International Day of Yoga at the United Nations, \r\nand, given its widespread recognition and popularity, \r\nwe urge all Member States and observer States, along \r\nwith United Nations agencies, to join in making that \r\ninitiative of our Prime Minister a success.\r\nThe transformation of sport as a global industry \r\nhas also provided considerable scope for economic \r\ndevelopment and employment-generation in several \r\ndeveloping countries. While the Olympic Games and \r\nother continental games have consistently promoted \r\neconomic engagement, India has also experienced a \r\nrecent spurt in domestic sporting engagements. The \r\ndevelopment of the Indian Premier League has been a \r\nhuge success and has transformed cricket’s popularity \r\nand visibility. Today it is India’s most profitable and \r\npopular sporting league and has generated employment \r\nand revenues for upcoming athletes/players, sporting \r\nassociations, companies and all stakeholders. India is \r\nnow using that format to encourage traditional sports \r\nlike Kabaddi and other modern established sports such \r\nas badminton and hockey. The gradual transformation \r\nof sports as popular entertainment is also aiding \r\nthe growth of the sporting goods industry, not just \r\ndomestically but also globally, thereby building a direct \r\nconnection between sports and economic development.\r\nIn view of the United Nations designation of \r\nsport as a fundamental human right, we have also \r\ntaken several concrete measures to popularize sport \r\nand ensure the greater participation of young people. \r\nIn taking forward the initiative and by building upon \r\nthe popular collegiate sports format that is prevalent \r\nglobally, the Association of Indian Universities and \r\nTransStadia have signed a 10-year alliance agreement \r\nto restructure and popularize a sports ecosystem. \r\nTransStadia and the Association of Indian Universities \r\naim to give further impetus to the spirit of peace, \r\neducation and development through sport. It provides \r\nan excellent platform for aspiring young sporting talent \r\nto prove its mettle.\r\nMy delegation also commends the city of Sochi, \r\nRussia, for having successfully organized the XXII \r\nWinter Olympic Games and the XI Winter Paralympic \r\nGames. We also congratulate Brazil for successfully \r\nhosting the superb sporting spectacle of the 2014 World \r\nCup of the International Federation of Association \r\nFootball (FIFA) and Germany for being its much \r\ndeserving winner. We would also like to express our \r\nappreciation for FIFA’s gesture of pledging $450,000 to \r\nhelp fight Ebola, an example of sport working for the \r\nbenefit of humankind.\r\nWe would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncompliment UNICEF for having designated, last year, \r\nthe Indian cricketing legend Sachin Tendulkar as their \r\nfirst brand ambassador for South Asia to promote \r\nhygiene and sanitation in the region. We are confident \r\nthat the association of such inspirational sporting icons \r\nwith those worthy causes will act as a force multiplier for \r\ngetting young people motivated to work for UNICEF’s \r\nsuccess in the region.\r\nOur appreciation must also be extended to the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace and the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General \r\nfor highlighting the importance of sport and for using \r\nit as a medium for furthering the cause of peace and \r\ndevelopment. Please rest assured of our Government’s \r\nsteadfast support for the success of that initiative.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Sport is a universal language for human \r\ninteraction. It promotes the strengthening of \r\nunderstanding among peoples and intercivilizational \r\ncomity. International sporting cooperation can play an \r\nimportant role in overcoming national and religious \r\nenmity and in countering the ideologies of intolerance. \r\n10/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\nThat is especially relevant these days when, faced \r\nwith globalization and the consequences of various \r\ncrises on both an international and a regional scale, \r\nwe are witnessing greater social, cultural and national \r\ntensions, religious discord and outbursts of extremism.\r\nIn such conditions, it is more important than \r\never for the international community to continue its \r\nefforts aimed at turning sport, which has such a huge \r\nunifying potential, into an engine for comprehensive \r\nsocioeconomic development and a means for achieving \r\nsolidarity, tolerance and cultural diversity. At the same \r\ntime, we are forced to note an alarming trend towards the \r\nerosion of one of the basic principles of the international \r\nsport movement, namely, the principle of sport beyond \r\nand above politics. Today, we are all witnesses to quite \r\nobvious attempts to use major international sports \r\nevents and sport as a whole as a lever for exerting \r\npolitical pressure and for promoting the latest interests \r\nof the day. In such cases, the international community \r\nfaces the task of having to work harder to preserve and \r\nstrengthen sport’s unifying mission.\r\nWe highly value United Nations activities aimed \r\nat enhancing international sports cooperation and \r\npromoting strengthened understanding among peoples \r\nand civilizations. The United Nations Office on Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace plays a key role in that \r\nregard. We consider the Office to be an important \r\nstructure within the United Nations system for the \r\nstrengthening the use of sport as an advocacy tool \r\nfor the Organization’s objectives, mission and values. \r\nIn that context, we note, in particular, the Office’s \r\ncontribution in assisting the work of the Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace International Working Group. \r\nRussia, as a co-chair of one of its thematic subgroups, \r\nintends to continue to actively cooperate on sport with \r\nour partners within the framework of the Working \r\nGroup.\r\nWe would like to extend our gratitude to the \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, Mr. Lemke, and the President \r\nof the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Bach, \r\nfor their support for the Russian efforts in preparing \r\nfor the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Sochi. \r\nThe praise we received from those distinguished and \r\nuniversally influential sports officials confirms that \r\nwhat we managed to do was not done in vain. The Sochi \r\nGames made a substantial contribution to popularizing \r\nthe international Olympic Movement, which was \r\ndemonstrated by the unprecedented number of Heads of \r\nState and Government and supporters from 126 States \r\nwho visited Sochi and by the record broadcast audience \r\nratings.\r\nThe 2014 Games were also unique in terms of their \r\ncontribution to the development of world sport. The \r\nSochi Olympics and Paralympics saw the participation \r\nof a record number of athletes. For the very first time, \r\ntop medals were won by representatives of 21 States. \r\nWith regard to the infrastructure inherited by the Sochi \r\narea, it includes an operational major winter sports \r\ntraining centre.\r\nThe Sochi Paralympics left a special legacy by \r\ngiving momentum to the creation in Russia of an \r\nenvironment of access for all within the framework of \r\nthe State’s equal access programme. Olympic ideals will \r\nbe promoted by the creation of a Russian international \r\nOlympic university in Sochi, which has already started \r\ntraining officials for the organization of major sports \r\nevents, including the Olympic Games.\r\nAs in the past, we are ready to continue \r\nconstructive international sports cooperation with our \r\nfriends throughout the world and to organize major \r\ninternational sports events and forums in our country \r\nat the highest possible levels.\r\nMr. Singer (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States would like to thank Monaco and Tunisia, \r\nthe co-Chairs of the Group of Friends of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, as well as the Special Adviser \r\nto the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, for their work in supporting \r\nsport’s role in furthering development and peace.\r\nThe United States is home to a vast array of \r\nsporting communities and activities. Americans of \r\nevery identity and background participate in sport, \r\nfrom backyard play and little leagues all the way \r\nto professional and international competition. That \r\ndiversity and universality of participation is what \r\nmakes sport the opportunity to advance development \r\nand peace. Part of what makes sport so important is that \r\nit promotes inclusiveness, bringing together people of \r\ndifferent ages, race, religion, social status, disability, \r\nsexual orientation and gender identity. Sport crosses all \r\nsegments of society and is instrumental in empowering \r\npeople of diverse backgrounds and identities, while \r\nfostering tolerance and respect for all people, no matter \r\nwhat they look like, where they worship or whom they \r\nlove.\r\n14-57849 11/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\nThe United States recognizes that sports diplomacy \r\nis a valuable means for strengthening cultural relations \r\namong nations. Through our SportsUnited programme, \r\nthousands of people from over 100 countries have \r\nparticipated in sports and cultural exchanges. \r\nSportsUnited engages people from around the world \r\nin four key ways. The Empowering Women and Girls \r\nThrough Sports initiative seeks to increase the number \r\nof women and girls worldwide involved in sport and \r\nto foster greater academic success, stronger leadership \r\nskills and improved health. The Sports Envoy Program \r\nmakes use of senior athletes to conduct team-building \r\nexercises overseas and engages youth in a dialogue on \r\nthe importance of education, positive health practices \r\nand respect for diversity. The Sports Visitors Program \r\ngives young people an opportunity to travel to the \r\nUnited States and discover how success in athletics \r\ncan be translated into the development of life skills \r\nand achievement in the classroom. And the Sports \r\nGrants initiative focuses on empowering athletes with \r\ndisabilities and underserved youth.\r\nSport provides a universal language that contributes \r\nto educating people on the values of respect, diversity, \r\ntolerance and fairness and is a means to combat all \r\nforms of discrimination and promote social inclusion \r\nfor all. \r\nMr. Ismail (Brunei Darussalam): Brunei Darussalam \r\nfully supports agenda item 11, “Sport for development \r\nand peace”. We also recognize the significant role and \r\npositive impact of sport in contributing to development \r\nand peace. In that regard, we have had a national sports \r\npolicy in place since 1989 that identifies sport as one \r\nof the crucial elements and most effective means for \r\nenhancing the quality of life. We believe that sport can \r\nbe an effective tool in getting people to communicate, \r\nunderstand one another and form friendships across \r\nnations and boundaries, and can, in the long run, bring \r\nabout peace and harmony. We are also convinced that \r\ndevelopment of that kind will ensue, not just at the \r\nnational level, but also in the world at large.\r\nIn Brunei Darussalam, we encourage everyone’s \r\nparticipation in sports activities, including youth and \r\nthe elderly. Our target includes having at least one \r\nsports facility located within two kilometres of each \r\npopulated area. We now have 673 sporting facilities with \r\n140 football fields, 200 outdoor and 260 indoor sports \r\nfacilities, 60 jogging tracks, and 13 public swimming \r\npools. Physical education has always been part of our \r\nnational education curriculum. Our schoolchildren and \r\nyouth are not only highly active in sports competitions \r\nacross the country, but have also participated in \r\nregional and international tournaments. We are also \r\nproud to now have a good representation of female \r\nathletes, instructors, coaches and sports administrators. \r\nAt present, females in Brunei Darussalam account \r\nfor almost 60 per cent of our national athletes. They \r\nrepresent the country at numerous subregional, regional \r\nand international sporting events, including the 2012 \r\nLondon Olympics.\r\nOur National Plan of Action on Persons with \r\nDisabilities seeks to promote and protect their rights \r\nand enhance their full participation in society as part \r\nof our efforts at inclusiveness. The Plan of Action is \r\ncarried out in close collaboration with both the private \r\nsector and non-governmental organizations to ensure \r\ninclusiveness and allow our people to reach their full \r\npotential. Our national sport events have also stressed \r\nthe rights of all people to participate, and our first \r\nathlete with disabilities took part in the London 2012 \r\nSummer Paralympic Games.\r\nIn commemorating the International Day of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace on 6 April this year, Brunei \r\nDarussalam organized, for the first time, a nation-wide \r\nsporting event, with the collaboration and participation \r\nof our national sports associations and bodies. Our \r\nobjective was to inculcate the spirit and value of sport \r\nfor all, equality and non-discrimination, fairness, \r\nintegrity, tolerance, respect and mutual understanding.\r\nAdditionally, we have two ongoing programmes \r\nin relation to sport for development and peace that \r\nespecially focus on our youth, who make up more than \r\n50 per cent of our population. The first is the Hassanal \r\nBolkiah Trophy for the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations Youth Football Championship for under-21-\r\nyear-old players. The initiator of that tournament, His \r\nMajesty the Sultan of Brunei Darussalam, encourages \r\nyoung athletes and sports enthusiasts from Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries to come \r\ntogether to uphold the spirit of sportsmanship and form \r\nbonds of friendship.\r\nThe tournament also seeks to promote greater \r\nunderstanding and contribute to the maintenance of a \r\nharmonious ASEAN community in South-East Asia. \r\nAnother programme is the annual five-day National \r\nYouth Challenge, which is aimed at cultivating the \r\nvalues and spirits of sport among our young people from \r\nan early age. That programme brings together youth \r\nfrom various backgrounds. Team-building exercises \r\n12/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\nthrough community service, such as helping the poor, \r\nthe elderly and people with special needs, form part of \r\nits activities.\r\nBrunei Darussalam welcomes the recent establishment \r\nof the Commonwealth Youth Sport for Development \r\nand Peace Working Group, which emphasizes youth \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, we have established two \r\ncommunication platforms, the first called Planning for \r\nthe Youth, By the Youth, the second being the National \r\nYouth Dialogue, whereby the Government takes young \r\npeople’s views into account in promoting healthy \r\nlifestyles, sports volunteerism and the sports industry.\r\nThe importance of sport for development in social \r\nharmony and economic progress is also upheld. To \r\nthat end, our Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, \r\nMinistry of Education, Ministry of Health and Ministry \r\nof Development, as well as the private sector, have been \r\nworking hand in hand organizing national and regional \r\nsporting events to promote healthy lifestyles.\r\nBrunei Darussalam welcomes the sharing of \r\nbest practices in sport for development and peace \r\nprogrammes with other Member States. We believe \r\nthat they will develop, enhance and strengthen our \r\nrelations with other Member States, and unite the world \r\ncommunity through social lifestyles, youth development \r\nand peace and by fostering sustainable development.\r\nMs. Almeida Watanabe Patriota (Brazil): As a \r\nlong-standing sponsor of the annual draft resolution \r\non sport as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace, Brazil is committed to \r\npromoting sport as an instrument for development and \r\npeace.\r\nSport is deeply rooted in the Brazilian culture \r\nand society. Our Constitution recognizes the practice \r\nof sport as a fundamental social right, in line with the \r\nUNESCO International Charter of Physical Education \r\nand Sport, which declares that sport and physical \r\neducation is a fundamental right for all. Moreover, the \r\nBrazilian Government firmly believes in the potential \r\nof sport as an important factor for social inclusion, \r\npoverty reduction and sustainable development. The \r\nGeneral Assembly’s resolutions and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reports on the issue have rightly recognized \r\nthe role of sport as a means to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We also believe that sport will \r\nbe equally instrumental in promoting the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nBrazil also sees sport’s potential to foster peace \r\nand unity. In that context, we recall the historic \r\nmatch between the Brazilian and Haitian national \r\nfootball selections in August 2004, when, responding \r\nto an invitation from the Prime Minister of Haiti, \r\nthe Brazilian national team travelled to Haiti to play \r\na Game for Peace, as it was called. The parade of \r\nBrazilian athletes along the 15-kilometre route to the \r\nstadium was followed by thousands of Haitians, who \r\nfor some hours put aside their differences and united \r\naround a common goal. The episode had long-lasting \r\neffects and produced a communion of interests, as \r\nwell as joy and peace, in a moment of political tension \r\nand instability. That illustrates how politics and sport, \r\nhistory and solidarity can coexist.\r\nBrazil is currently in the middle of a sport-centred \r\ndecade. We hosted the Fédération Internationale de \r\nFootball Association (FIFA) Confederations Cup in 2013 \r\nand the FIFA World Cup earlier this year. In September \r\n2015, Brazil will host the first World Indigenous Games \r\nand the Rio 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games in the \r\nfollowing year.\r\nThe decision to put forward its candidacy to host \r\nthose large sporting events is consistent with the \r\npriority Brazil accords to the promotion of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and social inclusion. In order to prepare for \r\nthem, the Government has been paying special attention \r\nto the human, social and development dimensions they \r\nencompass. Brazil is an advocate of the potential of \r\nsports to end discrimination. Together with FIFA, we \r\nworked towards a World Cup that could convey a strong \r\nmessage against discrimination and intolerance, under \r\nthe campaign entitled “Say No to Racism” that was \r\ncarried out during the World Cup.\r\nBrazil was part of the core group that presented \r\nresolution 24/1, entitled “Promoting human rights \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal”, to the Human \r\nRights Council at its twenty-fourth session, in \r\nSeptember 2013. It had more than 130 sponsors and \r\nwas adopted by consensus. The resolution recognizes \r\nsport as a universal language that has the potential to \r\ncontribute to educating people on the values of respect, \r\ndiversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means to \r\ncombat all forms of discrimination and promote social \r\ninclusion for all. It also reaffirms the need to combat \r\ndiscrimination and intolerance wherever they occur, \r\nwithin and outside the sporting context. It is therefore \r\nan important tool for fighting discrimination of any \r\nkind. In the same vein, Brazil was also one of the \r\n14-57849 13/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\nsponsors of Human Rights Council resolution 27/32, on \r\nhuman rights, sexual orientation and gender identity, \r\nand an active member of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual \r\nand Transgender Core Group at the United Nations.\r\nThe importance of sport is also recognized in \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child and in the \r\nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. \r\nDuring the opening of the 2012 Paralympic Games, \r\nthe Brazilian Government signed a joint declaration \r\nwith the Governments of the United Kingdom, the \r\nRussian Federation and the Republic of Korea on the \r\nrole of the Games in the promotion of human rights \r\nand of values such as accessibility, social inclusion, \r\nnon-discrimination, equality and respect. It is in that \r\nspirit that we will welcome the world to our country as \r\nhosts of the first World Indigenous Games in 2015 and \r\nthe Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2016.\r\nMs. Al-Hijji (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I am pleased \r\nto participate in the discussion of this item and to have \r\nQatar join the sponsors of draft resolution A/69/L.5 on \r\nthis item, which the General Assembly will adopt at \r\na later date. We believe it is an opportunity to recall \r\nthe importance of sport as a tool for reinforcing the \r\nobjectives of peace and development and the values \r\nwe all share and is a way to reaffirm that sport can \r\nplay a role in addressing social problems. We also \r\nwelcome the important elements mentioned in the draft \r\nresolution, including partnerships between the private \r\nand public sectors, the role of the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, the importance of \r\nfairness and integrity in sports competitions, equality, \r\nnon-discrimination among States and individuals in \r\nsports, and the rights of special groups such as children, \r\nwomen and the disabled to practice sports.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our appreciation \r\nfor the efforts of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace, and \r\nwe also thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/69/330).\r\nThe State of Qatar recognizes the importance \r\nof sports in promoting physical and psychological \r\nhealth and fitness, social cohesion and solidarity; in \r\ninculcating noble values in the younger generation; \r\nand in promoting development and peace. It is also a \r\nway to achieve tolerance and diversity. Accordingly, \r\nthe State of Qatar accords great importance to sports \r\nat the national, international and regional levels. We \r\nhave successfully hosted major sports events such as \r\nthe Asian Games in 2006 and the Doha GOALS Forum, \r\nwhich since 2012 has served as a forum for international \r\ndevelopment initiatives through sports, sponsored by \r\nHis Excellency Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar. Sports facilities in Qatar are \r\nsophisticated and state-of-the-art, and they enable the \r\npromotion of sports in Qatari society.\r\nAt the international level, our policy for \r\ninternational development includes a focus on initiatives \r\non sports and youth. The Qatar Olympic Committee \r\nis an important institution that has carried out many \r\nimportant initiatives and contributions at the national \r\nand international levels. We supported the forty-first \r\nsession of the United Nations Inter-Agency Games last \r\nApril in New York. Qatar is a member of the Group \r\nof Friends of Sport for Development and Peace at the \r\nUnited Nations and co-chaired that Group in Geneva in \r\n2013 with Costa Rica. The Qatar Olympic Committee \r\n2020-2022 is playing an important role in preparing \r\nQatar to host FIFA in 2022. It will be the first time that \r\nan Arab, Muslim and relatively small country will host \r\nsuch an important event.\r\nSince 2012, on the second Tuesday in February, \r\nQatar has celebrated National Sport Day, when public \r\ninstitutions and sports facilities organize various \r\nactivities to spread awareness of and participation in \r\nsports. That important initiative aims to expand the \r\nbase of participation in sports, health and physical \r\nactivity, opening opportunities for participation by all \r\nmembers of society in sports and raising awareness of \r\nsports and the importance of physical education and \r\nactivity. According to the decree by the Amir adopted \r\nrecently, the Day is a paid national holiday to enable \r\nemployees to participate and benefit. That initiative is \r\nan important example of the importance that the State \r\nof Qatar accords to sport and the manner in which it \r\nsupports participation in sports and inculcates the values \r\nof sports in Qatari culture, all for promoting a healthy \r\nsociety that aims to achieve peace and development.\r\nMr. Nell (Germany): The report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “Sport for development and peace: \r\nrealizing the potential” (A/69/330) underlines once \r\nagain the important role sport can play in the different \r\nareas of development and peacebuilding, including \r\nspecific initiatives undertaken by the Member States \r\nand entities of the United Nations system.\r\nSport activities bring together people from different \r\nregional, cultural and religious backgrounds and help \r\nto overcome cultural, linguistic and other barriers. \r\nSport plays a valuable role in contributing to social \r\n14/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\ncohesiveness and rapprochement between cultures and \r\npeoples. Moreover, sport programmes can foster social \r\ninclusion and help in overcoming discrimination, inter \r\nalia on the grounds of race, religion, political opinion, \r\ndisability, gender, sexual orientation and gender \r\nidentity. Sport can also help to promote the achievement \r\nof internationally agreed development goals, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Moreover, sport \r\nprogrammes can support social integration, especially \r\nafter periods of conflict.\r\nSport for development is playing an important role \r\nin German development cooperation. Recent examples \r\nare specific programmes that Germany supported in \r\nfive countries. The focus of each programme varies \r\nfrom country to country depending on its needs, but it \r\nemphasizes mainly gender equality, youth development, \r\nHIV/AIDS prevention, peacebuilding and violence \r\nprevention.\r\nWe are grateful to the Special Adviser to the \r\nSecretary-General on Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, my compatriot Mr. Wilfried Lemke, for bringing \r\ntogether and coordinating the different actors in the \r\nfields of sports and development: multilateral actors \r\nsuch as United Nations entities, national Governments, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil-society \r\norganizations. The Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace plays a key role in connecting people and \r\npromoting peace and mutual understanding. One \r\nvery important initiative in this regard is the Youth \r\nLeadership camps developed by the Office. Germany is \r\nproud to have hosted such camps twice already.\r\nI should like to conclude by thanking the co-Chairs \r\nof the Group of Friends for Sport for Development \r\nand Peace - in New York, Monaco and Tunisia, and in \r\nGeneva, Costa Rica and Qatar - for their engagement in \r\nthis important field of our work at the United Nations.\r\nMs. Mohamed (Ethiopia): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the Secretary-General for the report he \r\nsubmitted to the Assembly on the agenda item under \r\ndiscussion (A/69/330), in which the wide-ranging \r\nactivities conducted by the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Organization’s various agencies and \r\nother stakeholders, pursuant to resolution 67/17, were \r\ndescribed in detail, providing beneficial information on \r\nthe progress that we have made so far.\r\nWe welcome the report, as it underscores the \r\ncontinued attention accorded to the importance of sport \r\nin promoting peace, security and development. I also \r\nwish to join previous speakers in thanking Mr. Wilfried \r\nLemke, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General, for \r\nhis continuing support to Member States in their efforts \r\nto promote the role of sport for development and peace, \r\nin general, particularly in helping to enhance global \r\ncultural understanding and friendly relations.\r\nEthiopia recognizes the fact that sport has \r\ntraditionally played a significant role not only in \r\nenhancing the physical and mental well-being of \r\nindividuals and members of communities, but has also \r\nbenefited people by promoting and bringing about \r\nchange for the better in the social, economic and \r\npolitical domains of humanity. Its extraordinary ability \r\nto galvanize people in spite of their diverse national and \r\ncultural backgrounds must be further enhanced and \r\nharnessed to the advantage of all of us, as well as to \r\nenable us to defend our ideas and share our ambitions \r\nto fight poverty and achieve peace.\r\nEthiopia also believes that the integration and \r\nmainstreaming of sport in national development \r\nprogrammes and policies deserve due consideration in \r\norder to improve the lives of people in terms of health \r\nand physical strength and economically. As in most \r\ncountries, sport is very popular and is widely practiced \r\nby many people in Ethiopia. Indeed, at present our \r\npeople have become the beneficiaries of various kinds \r\nof sport activities, much more than in the past. \r\nBut sport has not yet reached the desired level that \r\nwe all expect it to achieve. Therefore, in recognition \r\nof the central role that sport could play in national \r\nsocioeconomic development, the Government has \r\ndeveloped a comprehensive national sport policy and \r\nhas put in place appropriate mechanisms to implement \r\nit.\r\nThe basic tenets on which the policy bases itself \r\ninclude, among others, the firm conviction that \r\nsport is the fundamental right of all citizens to enjoy \r\nand practice regardless of gender or sociocultural \r\nbackground and without any restrictions whatsoever. \r\nMoreover, the Government wishes to ensure that the \r\noverall organization and management of sport is \r\ncommunity-based and that the participation of society \r\nin different sports-related activities in their own \r\nlocalities, school and workplaces is in accordance \r\nwith their interests and preferences. Therefore it has \r\nundertaken further measures that help to implement the \r\nnational policy, with the support and cooperation of the \r\nrelevant governmental organizations and institutions.\r\n14-57849 15/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\nEthiopia not only acknowledges and recognizes the \r\npotential role of sport in enhancing overall human well-\r\nbeing and social changes in all aspects of life, but it \r\nhas also adapted various United Nations declarations \r\nand resolutions on sport and implemented them across \r\nthe country in various forms of sports activity. In \r\naddition, Ethiopia has chosen sport as one of its overall \r\ndevelopment priorities and hence has actively been \r\nworking to further enhance its useful contribution \r\nby integrating it into other national development and \r\npeace policies.\r\nAs a result, we have succeeded in bringing about \r\npositive changes in the areas of health, child and youth \r\ndevelopment, youth unemployment, the eradication \r\nof poverty, gender equality, the inclusion of persons \r\nwith disabilities, environmental protection and \r\npeacebuilding.\r\nOur ongoing five-year growth and transformation \r\nplan has been instrumental in promoting health, \r\nmental well-being and disease prevention through \r\nnumerous sport activities. It should also be noted that \r\nall current measures that have been taken in one way \r\nor another are linked to efforts in implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and other United \r\nNations development programmes.\r\nWe would like in this regard to call upon partners \r\nand other stakeholders to continue to help our national \r\ninstitutions in their capacity-building efforts in sport \r\nand physical education by providing financial, technical \r\nand logistical support for the development of sport \r\nprogrammes in Ethiopia.\r\nThough we are convinced that much has been \r\ndone, we feel confident that we are moving in the \r\nright direction to make sport into a potential tool \r\nfor national development in all aspects, including in \r\nstrengthening global understanding and friendship as \r\nwell as in pursuing our peace agenda. On the other hand, \r\nmobilizing resources to employ sport for development \r\nobjectives and to promote the peace agenda remains \r\na critical challenge, to be overcome in a sustainable \r\nmanner. Thus, in addressing resource constraints in \r\naddition to national efforts, cross-sectoral partnership \r\nand collaboration with regional and international \r\nstakeholders are of significant importance. Moreover, \r\nEthiopia needs the support of the United Nations and \r\nother development partners, most notably in the areas of \r\ncapacity-building, the provision of sports facilities and \r\nequipment, and the promotion of mass or community \r\nsport participation, with a view to fully harnessing the \r\npower of sport to promote development and peace.\r\nLet me in conclusion reiterate that Ethiopia will \r\nremain committed to implementing all sport-related \r\nresolutions of the United Nations and work with all \r\nstakeholders to promote sport as a tool for development \r\nand peace, nationally, regionally and across the rest of \r\nthe world.\r\nMr. Lazarev (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus has studied with a \r\ngreat deal of interest the report of the Secretary-General \r\nentitled “Sport for development and peace: realizing \r\nthe potential” (A/69/330). We would like to extend to \r\nhim our gratitude for its preparation. At the same time \r\nwe consider it important that in similar such reports, \r\nthe concrete actions of the United Nations with regard \r\nto developing sports in terms of peace and development \r\nand in banning negative manifestations – primarily \r\npoliticization of the preparations for and holding of \r\nsports events – should be made clear. That could be \r\nfostered, first and foremost, by promoting practical \r\ninteraction and cooperation among the leadership of \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat and the International \r\nOlympic Committee.\r\nAs shown by the report’s examples, sport is a tool \r\nfor intercultural dialogue and understanding. It can and \r\nshould contribute towards achieving the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals and to forging relations among \r\nindividuals and among States. Major international sports \r\nevents often achieve more in dispelling stereotypes and \r\nprejudice than any political process.\r\nWe congratulate the Russian Federation on the \r\nsuccessful conduct of the XXII Olympic Winter Games \r\nand the XI Paralympic Winter Games in Sochi, which \r\nachieved the expected high level and tangibly confirmed \r\nthe contribution of sports and the Olympic movement in \r\nbuilding a more peaceful and happier planet. I also take \r\nthe opportunity to congratulate our Russian colleagues \r\non the Russian team’s impressive victory in the final of \r\nthe 78th Ice Hockey World Championship, hosted by \r\nBelarus in Minsk, in May. The championship in Minsk \r\nagain underscores a simple truth: the politicization of \r\nsports events is unacceptable and contravenes basic \r\nsports principles, and it serves no purpose.\r\nWe intend to continue to actively support the \r\nprinciples of neutrality and depoliticization of sports \r\nas a necessary precondition in fully achieving sports’ \r\npotential for peace and development. We are convinced \r\n16/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\nthat the politicization of sports and the Olympic Games \r\nis incompatible with the principles of friendly, civilized \r\nintergovernmental relations, as well as the ideals and \r\nprinciples of sports and indeed the spirit and letter of \r\nthe Olympic Charter.\r\nWe wish Brazil and the Republic of Korea every \r\nsuccess in preparing and conducting important sports \r\nevents and express the hope that those events will be \r\nfully in keeping with the highest standards and the \r\nspirit and letter of the Olympic Charter.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 64/3, of 19 October 2009, I now give the \r\nf loor to the observer of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee.\r\nMr. Pescante (International Olympic Committee): \r\nOn behalf of the International Olympic Committee \r\n(IOC), the supreme authority of the Olympic Movement, \r\nand in my capacity as Permanent Observer, I welcome \r\nthe opportunity to address the General Assembly today \r\nto provide our perspective on the role of sport as a tool \r\nfor development and peace.\r\nAllow me to congratulate and thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report (A/69/330) \r\noutlining the many ways that sport is contributing \r\nto a better world and the approaches that need to be \r\nstrengthened.\r\nWith the Olympic Games, the IOC is able to set an \r\nexample of global peaceful interaction. The Olympic \r\nGames, the Olympic athletes and in particular the \r\nOlympic Village are powerful symbols of that. They \r\nbreak down any kind of barrier: political, geographical, \r\nethnic, religious and cultural. They serve as an example \r\nof mutual respect and non-discrimination. They bring \r\nOlympic values to life and demonstrate their unifying \r\npower to a global audience. The Olympic Movement \r\ncannot be truly successful unless we leverage that \r\npositive power year-round and with the support of \r\npartners. The past two years have seen many important \r\ndevelopments in that area, especially in the strong \r\npartnership between the IOC and the United Nations \r\nand in several joint initiatives with its agencies and \r\nprogrammes.\r\nThe IOC’s collaboration with the United Nations \r\ndemonstrates the positive impact of effective \r\nengagement among sport, politics, culture and other \r\naspects of society. Sport can change the world, Nelson \r\nMandela said, but it cannot change the world alone. \r\nThat is why the IOC, under President Thomas Bach, is \r\nengaging more than ever before with political leaders at \r\nthe highest level. Since taking office a little more than \r\na year ago, President Bach has met with 85 Heads of \r\nState and Government, and he confers regularly with \r\nthe Secretary-General. As President Bach has said,\r\n“It is time that sport is no longer isolated from \r\npolitics. We will always be neutral, but we will talk \r\nwith Governments and work with organizations \r\nlike the United Nations.”\r\nThose relationships must be built on a foundation \r\nof mutual respect that protects the autonomy of sport. \r\nSport is unique. It is guided by truly universal principles \r\nthat are based on globally recognized ethics: fair play, \r\nrespect and friendship. Government and political \r\ninterference dismantle that global framework and \r\nrender sport ineffective as a tool for positive change.\r\nIn keeping with the emphasis on expanded \r\nengagement, and in another sign of the strong \r\nrelationship between the IOC and the United Nations, \r\nPresident Bach and the Secretary-General signed an \r\nhistoric agreement in April to strengthen cooperation \r\nbetween the two organizations. Among other things, \r\nthe agreement calls for using sport to promote a \r\nnumber of social dimensions, including women’s \r\nempowerment, inclusion, healthy lifestyles promotion \r\nand peacebuilding. Those goals are embedded in the \r\nOlympic Agenda 2020, our strategic road map that will \r\nshape the future of the Olympic Movement. The IOC is \r\nexploring ways to use sport even more effectively as a \r\ntool for positive change.\r\nIn this time of increased sedentary behaviour, \r\npersistent inequalities for girls and women, rampant \r\nsocial exclusion and devastating conflict, the world \r\nneeds sport more than ever. We strongly encourage \r\nGovernments and other stakeholders to increase access \r\nto safe and protected sport for all, particularly for girls \r\nand women, people with disabilities and marginalized \r\ncommunities. We strongly encourage others to join the \r\nIOC in promoting sport and physical activity for health \r\nand well-being.\r\nSport and physical activity can help ensure inclusive \r\nand equitable quality education and promote lifelong \r\nlearning. They encourage school attendance and can help \r\nteach social skills. We strongly encourage the inclusion \r\nof quality and age-appropriate physical education in \r\nschool curricula, along with values education. Sport \r\ncan help make cities and human settlements safe and \r\nsustainable. Sport helps steer young people away from \r\n14-57849 17/18\r\n20/10/2014 A/69/PV.28\r\ndelinquency and dangerous behaviour. Sport promotes \r\nsocial cohesion and helps lower health-care costs. \r\nWe strongly encourage investment in sport facilities, \r\ninfrastructure and safe play spaces, which can help \r\nbuild active and healthy cities. Sport and physical \r\nactivity need to be seriously considered in the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. They provide a meaningful \r\nway to advancing any future sustainable development \r\ngoals, especially on issues related to health, education \r\nand community life.\r\nSport can also contribute to advancing environmental \r\nprotection. The IOC is committed to working with the \r\nUnited Nations and other stakeholders to ensure that \r\nsport plays a significant role in achieving a sustainable \r\napproach to development. Environmental considerations \r\nhave been included in planning and organizing the \r\nOlympic Games for 20 years, and we have called on \r\nother sport organizations to follow that example. This \r\nyear marks the twentieth anniversary of the partnership \r\nbetween the IOC and United Nations in that area. The \r\npartnership has most recently provided support and \r\nguidance during preparations for the Olympic Winter \r\nGames in Sochi and for the upcoming Games in Rio in \r\n2016.\r\nLet me not forget to mention the importance of \r\nsport to peacebuilding. I want to thank the General \r\nAssembly for the work on and adoption of resolution \r\n68/9 – the Olympic Truce resolution – in November \r\n2013, in view of the Sochi Games. The steadfast \r\nand consistent support by the United Nations of the \r\nOlympic Truce is an excellent example of how the \r\nsport movement and Governments can work together to \r\nadvance common goals. The Truce will not bring about \r\nworld peace, but it sends a strong symbolic message \r\nto the entire world. A new consultation process for an \r\nOlympic Truce resolution urging an end to conflict \r\nin the context of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de \r\nJaneiro is to start in the coming months, and we hope \r\nthat the General Assembly and all Member States will \r\nonce again unanimously support it.\r\nIn all of these initiatives, the IOC is grateful for the \r\nsupport and assistance provided by the United Nations \r\nGroup of Friends of Sport for Development and Peace \r\nand its co-Chairs, Ambassadors Picco and Khiari. We \r\nthank in particular Mr. Wilfried Lemke, Special Adviser \r\nto the Secretary-General on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, and the entire team at the United Nations \r\nOffice on Sport for Development and Peace. We are \r\nnaturally extremely grateful to the Secretary-General, \r\na true friend of sport and the Olympic Movement. His \r\nparticipation at the IOC session in Sochi and his run in \r\nthe Olympic Torch relay is a great sign of the depth of \r\nhis personal commitment.\r\nTogether, the IOC and the United Nations are using \r\nsport to improve lives and build better communities \r\naround the world. As outlined in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, we have seen much progress over \r\nthe past two years. The Secretary-General has also \r\nreminded us that there is still much more to do. Let \r\nme reiterate the strong commitment and determination \r\nof the International Olympic Committee to ensuring \r\nour collaboration to build together a better and more \r\npeaceful future for the young generations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 11.\r\nThe observer of the Observer State of Palestine has \r\nrequested the f loor in exercise of the right of reply. I \r\nremind him that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention \r\nand to 5 minutes for the second intervention and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Hantouli (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nI speak in right of reply on behalf of the delegation \r\nof the Observer State of Palestine, in response to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Israel, the \r\noccupying Power.\r\nWe would have liked to have been able to come to \r\nthe General Assembly to consider this important agenda \r\nitem and to take stock of the progress and achievements \r\nwe have made within the framework of sport, especially \r\nits role in development and peace. However, we regret \r\nthe fact that we are experiencing a difficult phase, with \r\nthe Israeli occupation dominating all aspects of life, \r\nincluding sport.\r\nThe occupying Power hampers the development \r\nand maintenance of sport infrastructure, for example. \r\nIt hampers the movement of athletes, technicians \r\nand, of course, spectators. If we want to organize any \r\nPalestinian sport activities in the territory of Palestine, \r\nthat involves a decision that is hostage to the vagaries of \r\nIsrael’s mood at the time. In most cases, Israel attempts \r\nto ensure that the majority of Palestinian sport events \r\nor activities do not happen. Israel’s violations of human \r\nrights in general, and the rights of athletes in particular, \r\nare ongoing.\r\n18/18 14-57849\r\nA/69/PV.28 20/10/2014\r\nRecently, during the war against Gaza, such \r\nviolations took place, and we lost a number of our \r\nathletes, for example, the athlete and recognized trainer \r\nAahid Zaqout. Mohamed Bakr, age 9, Atef Bakr, age \r\n10, Zakaria Bakr, age 10, and Mohamed Ramez, age \r\n11, could have participated alongside Ahmed in sports \r\nactivities, including with Israeli children. However, \r\nthe occupying Power decided otherwise and killed \r\nthem while they were engaged in sport activities on \r\nthe beaches of Gaza. Those children are proof that the \r\nculture of life is something that is deeply rooted in our \r\nspirit and in our adults and children. Unfortunately, the \r\noccupying Power continues to destroy all initiatives \r\nor means aimed at achieving development and peace \r\nin Palestine. Sport is no exception here. Sport, too, is \r\ndestroyed.\r\nMunich was was a one-time occurrence. It will \r\nnot be repeated. Israel’s practices – its massacres of \r\nthe Palestinian people, including athletes – have gone \r\non now for 66 years. In that time, Israel has broken \r\nall records when it comes to human rights violations. \r\nThey have won every gold medal and trophy in that \r\ncategory. Israel, the occupying Power, will not put an \r\nend to its practices until the international community \r\ntakes up its responsibilities with regard to that country, \r\nwhich practices terrorism, for we have not asked it to be \r\nresponsible for its actions.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 11.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12 noon.\r\n"
