The members of \r\nthe Council shall be elected directly and individually, \r\nby secret ballot, by the majority of the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Accordingly, 97 votes constitute \r\na majority in the General Assembly, which has a \r\nmembership of 193 States.\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution \r\n65/281 of 17 June 2011, beginning in 2013 the Human \r\nRights Council will start its yearly membership cycle \r\non 1 January and, as a transitional measure, the period \r\nof office of members of the Human Rights Council \r\nending in June 2014 has been exceptionally extended \r\nuntil the end of the calendar year.\r\nThe following States will continue to be members \r\nof the Human Rights Council: Algeria, Argentina, \r\nBrazil, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Cuba, Estonia, Ethiopia, \r\nFrance, Gabon, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKenya, Maldives, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nNamibia, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian \r\nFederation, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the United \r\nArab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, the United States of America, the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Viet Nam.

Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n2/3 14-58105\r\nA/69/PV.29 21/10/2014\r\nConsistent with the practice of the General \r\nAssembly, if more than the required number of Member \r\nStates have obtained the votes of the majority of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly on the same ballot, those \r\nMember States that have obtained the largest number \r\nof votes above the required majority will be considered \r\nas elected, up to the number of seats to be filled. Also, \r\nconsistent with past practice, in case, due to a tie vote, \r\nit should become necessary to determine one candidate \r\nto be elected or that will proceed to the next round of \r\nrestricted balloting, there will be a special restricted \r\nballot limited to those candidates that have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Accordingly, the election shall be \r\nheld by secret ballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nAgain, I should like to repeat that the 15 vacant \r\nseats are to be filled from among the regional groups as \r\nfollows: four seats from among the African States; four \r\nseats from among the Asia-Pacific States; two seats \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States; three seats \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States; \r\nand two seats from among the Western European and \r\nother States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nIn addition, I have been informed by the Secretariat \r\nthat voluntary pledges and commitments made by \r\nMember States in accordance with paragraph 8 of \r\nresolution 60/251 were accordingly issued, when \r\nreceived on time before the elections, as official \r\ndocuments of the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s nameplate.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time when the General \r\nAssembly is conducting the elections. I remind them that \r\nduring the voting procedure, all campaigning should \r\ncease in the General Assembly Hall. That means that, \r\nonce the meeting has begun, no more campaign material \r\ncan be distributed inside the Hall. All representatives \r\nare also requested to remain at their seats so that the \r\nvoting process can proceed in an orderly manner. I \r\nshould also like to remind delegations to refrain from \r\nextending congratulations in the General Assembly \r\nHall after the announcement of the elected members. It \r\nis disruptive to the distribution of ballot papers for any \r\nsubsequent rounds of balloting. I thank representatives \r\nfor their cooperation.\r\nI would also like to remind members of the media \r\nnot to focus their cameras on delegations during the \r\nvoting process, taking into account that this is a secret \r\nballot in accordance with the rules of procedures of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I thank members of the media for \r\ntheir cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now be \r\ndistributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to one of the \r\nfive regional groups and has the corresponding number \r\nof blank lines for the seats assigned to that region.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot \r\npapers and to write on them the names of the States \r\nfor which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing \r\nmore names from the relevant region than the number \r\nof seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. A \r\nballot will also be declared invalid if all the names of \r\nthe Member States on that ballot do not belong to the \r\nrelevant region. If a ballot paper of a region includes \r\nboth the names of Member States that belong to and \r\nthat are from outside of that region, the ballot remains \r\nvalid but only the names of the Member States that \r\nbelong to the relevant region will be counted. If a ballot \r\npaper contains names of Member States that are not \r\neligible for re-election or that are currently members of \r\nthe Council, the ballot remains valid, but those names \r\nwill not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Andujar \r\n(Dominican Republic), Ms. Lobo Juarez (Honduras), \r\nMrs. Oanţă (Romania), Mr. Shaker (Saudi Arabia), \r\nMr. Kunene (Swaziland) and Ms. Mattsson \r\n(Sweden) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.35 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\n14-58105 3/3\r\n21/10/2014 A/69/PV.29\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:   1\r\nNumber of members voting:  191\r\nRequired absolute majority:   97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGhana 187\r\nNigeria 187\r\nCongo  185\r\nBotswana   183\r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo   2\r\nBenin  2\r\nGroup B — Asia-Pacific States\r\nNumber of ballot papers  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:   0\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:   97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIndia 162\r\nIndonesia 152\r\nBangladesh 149\r\nQatar 142\r\nThailand 136\r\nKuwait   2\r\nCambodia  1\r\nPhilippines  1\r\nBahrain  1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:   9\r\nNumber of members voting:  183\r\nRequired absolute majority:   97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAlbania 176\r\nLatvia 175\r\nRomania  3\r\nLithuania  1\r\nCzech Republic  1\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:   0\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:   97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nEl Salvador 151\r\nBolivia (Plurinational State of) 144\r\nParaguay 139\r\nCosta Rica  120\r\nPeru  2\r\nGroup E — Western European and Other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:   0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:   6\r\nNumber of members voting:  186\r\nRequired absolute majority:   97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nPortugal 184\r\nNetherlands 172\r\nItaly  1\r\nGreece  1\r\nHaving obtained the required majority and the \r\nlargest number of votes of the members of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the following 15 States were \r\nelected members of the Human Rights Council for \r\na three-year term of office beginning on 1 January \r\n2015: Albania, Bangladesh, Bolivia (Plurinational \r\nState of), Botswana, Congo, El Salvador, Ghana, \r\nIndia, Indonesia, Latvia, Netherlands, Nigeria, \r\nParaguay, Portugal and Qatar.\r\nThe President: I congratulate those States that \r\nhave been elected members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (c) of agenda item 112.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.40 a.m.\r\n"
