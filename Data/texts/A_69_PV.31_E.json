"*1459369*\r\n14-59369 (E)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mrs. Al-Mughairy \r\n(Oman), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 40 (continued)\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/69/98)\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines voted in favour of \r\nresolution 69/5, and we align ourselves fully with the \r\nstatements delivered this morning on behalf of the \r\nCaribbean Community, the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, and the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States(see A/69/PV.30).\r\nPrevious versions of this resolution have been \r\nadopted for the past 22 sessions of the General \r\nAssembly, and have enjoyed near-unanimous support \r\nover the years. Indeed, today was no different. There \r\nis no other example of the international community \r\nspeaking so overwhelmingly and so consistently. \r\nHowever, the embargo remains stubbornly in place, and \r\nits negative impacts have intensified.\r\nThe embargo has been and continues to be a \r\nviolation of International law. It is contrary to the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines takes \r\nthe f loor to re-emphasize our deeply held conviction \r\nthat the ongoing embargo is a f lagrant, massive and \r\nsystematic violation of the rights of an entire people. \r\nMoreover, the embargo against Cuba is not merely a \r\nbilateral matter, between Cuba and the United States, \r\nbut, due to its extraterritorial nature, it violates the \r\nsovereign rights of many other States.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines believes that this \r\nblockade is not only illegal but morally unsustainable. \r\nThomas Paine, in the introduction to his famed essay \r\nentitled “Common Sense”, wrote:\r\n“A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives \r\nit a superficial appearance of being right and raises \r\nat first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. \r\nBut the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more \r\nconverts than reason.”\r\nAnd so it is today, with respect to this blockade. \r\nCitizens across the United States are joining the \r\ninternational community by increasingly voicing their \r\ndisapproval and calling for the lifting of the unilateral \r\nsanctions. Opposition to this inhumane policy is now \r\nalmost universal in nature. Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines therefore feels compelled to recall the words \r\nof President Barack Obama in his inaugural address to \r\nthe United Nations in 2009. President Obama told us \r\nthen: “The world must stand together to demonstrate \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.31\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n31st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 28 October 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

No world order that elevates one nation or \r\ngroup of people over another will succeed. ... The \r\ntraditional divisions between nations of the South \r\nand the North make no sense in an interconnected \r\nworld, nor do alignments of nations rooted in the \r\ncleavages of a long-gone cold war.\r\n“The time has come to realize that the old \r\nhabits and the old arguments are irrelevant \r\nto the challenges faced by our peoples.” \r\n(A/64/PV.3, pp. 11 and 10)\r\nWe believe that the time has indeed come for the \r\nright thing to be done. And as President Obama enters \r\nthe final phase of his presidency, we hope that his \r\nunderstanding of what is just will soon be accompanied \r\nby the requisite action to make it so.\r\nThe Cuban people have given freely of themselves \r\nin a manner that has touched the hearts of the people of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines. No dollar amount can \r\nadequately reflect the value of their support, solidarity \r\nand partnership. Our appreciation cannot be overstated. \r\nWe also join the international community in applauding \r\nthe Cuban Government for its response to the Ebola \r\nvirus and its efforts to combat it. Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines remains unequivocal in its call for the \r\nremoval of this constraint on the development of our \r\nCaribbean neighbour.\r\nMr. Ja Song Nam (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): It is the consistent policy of the Government \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\noppose every kind of sanction, including economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargoes on sovereign \r\nStates. The United States blockade of Cuba is a \r\nlegacy of the Cold War, designed to overthrow the \r\nlegitimate social system chosen by the Cuban people. \r\nThe unilateral and extraterritorial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States on Cuba constitutes an obvious \r\ninfringement on Cuba’s sovereignty, in clear violation \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw, and is a violation of human rights that tramples \r\non people’s right to life and development. It deserves \r\nto be condemned as strongly as possible by the United \r\nNations and the international community.\r\nThe criminal policy of the imposition by the United \r\nStates of an embargo on Cuba for more than half a \r\ncentury has caused economic and social losses to Cuba \r\namounting to more than $1.1 trillion, as well as affecting \r\nthird-party countries that have normal economic and \r\ntrade relations with Cuba, and thus remains the main \r\nobstacle to the country’s socioeconomic development \r\nand its people’s well-being. This inhumane and \r\nanachronistic policy should therefore be terminated \r\nwithout delay, in conformity with the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and the demands of the \r\ninternational community. Today the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations - including Cuba, which aspires to \r\nsustainable development in a peaceful environment - \r\nhave unanimously demanded an end to the unilateral \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade of Cuba \r\nby the United States.\r\nConsistent with our customary stand in opposition \r\nto any kind of interference or sanctions against \r\nsovereign States, the delegation of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea today voted in favour \r\nof resolution 69/5, on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America on Cuba, as it has for \r\nsimilar resolutions in the past, and once again strongly \r\nurges the United States to abandon its blockade of \r\nCuba immediately. The Government of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea fully supports the efforts of \r\nthe Government and people of Cuba to end the United \r\nStates embargo, and will continue to further expand \r\nand develop its economic and trade relations with Cuba \r\nin the future.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our strong support \r\nfor and solidarity with the struggle of the Cuban \r\nGovernment and people to safeguard their national \r\ndignity and sovereignty against the attempts by the \r\nUnited States to impose a unilateral blockade.\r\nMr. Elnor (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to welcome the participation in this morning’s \r\nmeeting (A/69/PV.30) of Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nThe Sudan associates itself with the statements \r\ndelivered this morning by the representatives of \r\nBolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM), Malawi on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, and Saudi Arabia on behalf of the members of \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\r\nWe voted with complete conviction today in \r\nfavour of resolution 69/5, on the necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\n14-59369 3/8\r\n28/10/2014 A/69/PV.31\r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba. \r\nOnce more, and for the twenty-third time, the General \r\nAssembly has renewed its categorical rejection of the \r\nunjust unilateral sanctions policy imposed by the United \r\nStates on Cuba. Through today’s vote, the international \r\ncommunity has spoken unanimously in expressing its \r\ntotal condemnation of such coercive measures, which \r\nare contrary to international law and the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and marine and \r\ntrade freedoms, as well as the rules and customs that \r\nhave traditionally regulated international economic and \r\nfinancial relations among States.\r\nThe overwhelming majority – 188 countries \r\n– voting in favour of the resolution highlights the \r\nillegality of the aggressive United States policies \r\nagainst Cuba, which have continued for the past 55 \r\nyears. It emphasizes Member States’ unity of support \r\nin the face of dictatorial and hegemonic policies, \r\ninterference in the internal affairs of another State and \r\nthe imposition of coercive unilateral measures against \r\nanother nation in an attempt to affect their national \r\nchoices amd their social and economic systems. That is \r\nillegal, unacceptable and undemocratic, and it deserves \r\nthe total condemnation of the international community. \r\nYear after year, the General Assembly renews its \r\nrejection of individual unilateral coercive measures \r\nthat have a negative effect on the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of developing countries in particular and \r\nrun counter to the outcome document of the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 66/288, annex) and relevant documents \r\nadopted in the past at meetings and summits of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, NAM and developing countries \r\nas a means of settling political accounts.\r\nSince 1997, my country has been dealing with \r\na unilateral and unfair embargo imposed on it by the \r\nUnited States and renewed last week. It has adversely \r\naffected every area of life, including bank transactions, \r\naccess to loans, the ability to import spare parts and \r\ncooperation with other countries seeking to meet the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and to achieve peace \r\nand security. For that reason, and through our expression \r\nof solidarity with the friendly Government and people \r\nof Cuba, we reject such illegal embargo policies, which \r\nhave had an impact on every aspect of our lives, at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels, and have \r\nhad a serious impact on the poor and vulnerable.\r\nWe wish to express our complete solidarity with \r\nCuba as well as our appreciation for its humanitarian \r\nrole in fighting the Ebola epidemic in Africa. We \r\nalso express our solidarity with all nations, especially \r\ndeveloping countries, that reject unilateral and illegal \r\nmeasures. We call for the lifting of the embargo and \r\nsanctions on Cuba and oppose all similarly illegal and \r\ninhuman policies that weigh upon other countries.\r\nMs. Carrion (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to welcome the presence of \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla. \r\nNext, I would like to align my statement with the \r\nstatements made on behalf of the Southern Common \r\nMarket, the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States and the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/69/PV.30).\r\nAs in previous years, Uruguay has voted in favour \r\nof the resolution presented by the delegation of Cuba \r\n(resolution 69/5) on the understanding that the embargo \r\nagainst that country is contrary to the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter and \r\ncontravenes the rules of international law, in particular \r\nthe rules governing international trade and those \r\ninvolving members of the World Trade Organization. \r\nUruguay’s position fits into the broader context of \r\ndefending multilateralism, non-intervention and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, which are fundamental \r\nprinciples of our diplomacy. In addition, this situation \r\naffects another fundamental principle, that of the \r\nlegal equality of States. It is precisely out of respect \r\nfor that principle our country rejects any unilateral or \r\nextraterritorial coercive measure that violates the rules \r\nof international law and the principles of the United \r\nNations Charter, the clearest contemporary example \r\nof which is the embargo unjustly imposed against the \r\nRepublic of Cuba. \r\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay has expressed on \r\nseveral occasions and reiterates at this time its direct \r\nopposition to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba, which severely affects \r\nthe welfare of the Cuban people. Indeed, the blockade, \r\ncontrary to the principle of justice and human rights, \r\nrepresents a collective punishment of the Cuban \r\npeople as it generates shortages, seriously damages the \r\nCuban economy and limits and retards the country’s \r\ndevelopment. \r\nOut of principle, Uruguay rejects and does not \r\nrecognize in its national legislation the extraterritorial \r\napplication of domestic laws of other States. In that \r\n4/8 14-59369\r\nA/69/PV.31 28/10/2014\r\nregard, we condemn the application of unilateral \r\ncoercive measures by the United States against Cuba, \r\nwhich are a form of pressure and an obstacle to dialogue \r\nand the necessary rapprochement between the parties \r\nthat we hope to see resumed. By voting in favour of \r\nresolution 69/5, Uruguay reiterates its commitment \r\nto multilateralism as a legitimate instrument for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States and an \r\neffective tool for promoting international cooperation, \r\nhuman rights, security and understanding among \r\npeoples.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): I would like first to \r\nwelcome the presence of His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba. \r\nThe delegation of Indonesia associates itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, who spoke on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, \r\nrespectively (see A/69/PV.30).\r\nFaithful to its history and to its national character, \r\nIndonesia is a country committed to peace, justice and \r\nequality. For that reason, Indonesia stands before the \r\nGeneral Assembly to once again declare our unstinting \r\nsupport for ending the embargo against Cuba. We must \r\nwithout delay overcome this relic of another time, for \r\nit has no raison d’être in the millennium that we are \r\nbuilding together. I will give the Assembly four valid \r\nreasons bringing the embargo to an end.\r\nFirst, it is against the very principles of the sovereign \r\nequality of all Member States and of non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in each others’ domestic affairs, \r\nas stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nCharter clearly sets forth the need for Member States \r\nto refrain from the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of any \r\nState. The continued imposition of an economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba \r\nclearly violates the Charter. All Member States are \r\nequal. None is above any other, as we are bound by the \r\nprinciples of friendly relations among nations under the \r\nCharter. At the United Nations, dialogue has always \r\nbeen the form put forward by any civilized nation to \r\nresolve differences. There should be cooperation rather \r\nthan confrontation.\r\nSecondly, the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba has caused significant \r\neconomic and social hardship that can hardly be \r\njustified on humanitarian grounds. It has caused years \r\nof deprivation for the people of Cuba, especially for \r\nvulnerable groups such as children, women and older \r\npersons. That is a great burden for a developing country \r\nwhose people would benefit tremendously from the \r\ngood faith of developed countries. The Assembly has \r\nalso been discussing an ambitious vision to eradicate \r\npoverty through an inclusive post-2015 development \r\nagenda. That agenda would be inclusive only if those \r\nwho are most vulnerable, including the people of Cuba, \r\nwere involved in the process and were able to enjoy the \r\nbenefits of development without any constraints being \r\nbrought to bear by foreign hands.\r\nThirdly, the sanctions are a counterproductive \r\npolicy that has curbed opportunities and economic \r\nbenefits for Cuba and other countries, including \r\ncountries that hold economic and commercial ties with \r\nCuba. In that process, the sovereignty of other States \r\nand their jurisdiction in national legislation has been \r\nencroached upon. Cuba is not the only victim. We, \r\ndeveloping countries, trade partners and financial \r\ninvestors, are also victims of this undeserved embargo.\r\nFourthly, our regional experience in South-East \r\nAsia has immensely increased our confidence in the \r\nidea that engagement does more good than isolation in \r\nadvancing the noble causes to which all States Members \r\nof the United Nations subscribe. The time is ripe for \r\nrelations between the parties involved to be transformed \r\nthrough constructive engagement. Cuba should be able \r\nto exercise its right to develop and grow, unhindered \r\nby restrictions to its trade and other business activities.\r\nWhile it is true that some small but meaningful \r\nchanges have occurred in recent times, such as the \r\neasing of restrictions on travel to Cuba and the removal \r\nof obstacles to the transfer of remittances, the preferred \r\noutcome is for the embargo to be lifted completely. \r\nIndonesia urges States to renounce applying laws or \r\nmeasures of an extraterritorial nature that affect the \r\nsovereignty of other States, the lawful interests of their \r\nsubjects or of other persons under their jurisdiction, \r\nand the freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nIndonesia voted in favour of resolution 69/5 and \r\nreiterates the call for the immediate cessation of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\n14-59369 5/8\r\n28/10/2014 A/69/PV.31\r\nCuba. Our message is very simple. Our message is very \r\nclear. This embargo has to end.\r\nMr. Shava (Zimbabwe): I would like to welcome \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, to this Hall. \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, Bolivia \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and Malawi on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States (see A/69/PV.30).\r\nOnce again, Zimbabwe wishes to express its concern \r\nover the illegal and ruinous economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade of Cuba by the United States. \r\nZimbabwe is dismayed that, instead of being removed, \r\nthe embargo is actually being reinforced, resulting \r\nin greater suffering for the people and tremendous \r\ndisruptions to Cuban business activities and financial \r\ntransactions. The majority of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations have continued to reject, as they did \r\ntoday, the passing of national laws with extraterritorial \r\nimpact and all other coercive economic measures, \r\nincluding unilateral sanctions, which are mainly \r\ntargeted against developing countries that seek to \r\nreassert their sovereignty. Zimbabwe, another victim \r\nof ill-conceived, illegal and immoral sanctions, fully \r\nunderstands their impact. \r\nDuring the past 20 years, Zimbabwe has stated that \r\nthe embargo against Cuba contravenes the fundamental \r\nnorms of international law, international humanitarian \r\nlaw, the Charter of the United Nations and all the norms \r\nand principles governing peaceful relations among \r\nStates. The embargo is also a violation of the principles of \r\nthe sovereign equality of States and of non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs. \r\nThose principles were reaffirmed in the Declaration \r\nof the High-level Meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the Rule of Law at the National and International \r\nLevels (resolution 67/1) adopted on 24 September 2012, \r\nin which Heads of State and Government strongly \r\nurged States to refrain from promulgating and applying \r\nunilateral economic, financial and trade measures not \r\nin accordance with international law and the Charter \r\nof the United Nations that impede the full achievement \r\nof economic and social development, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nZimbabwe therefore joins other countries in \r\ncondemning the punitive embargo on Cuba, and calls \r\nfor its unconditional lifting so that the people of Cuba \r\ncan be left alone to pursue their economic and social \r\ndestiny.\r\nMr. Kihurani (Kenya): In explanation of vote, \r\nKenya associates itself with the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia on behalf of the Group of 77 and China; the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement; and Malawi on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States (See A/69/PV.30). \r\nKenya voted in favour of resolution 69/5, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. As in previous years, Kenya \r\nremains opposed to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States on \r\nCuba, based on the fact that the application of unilateral \r\nand extraterritorial economic and financial embargoes \r\nviolates the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law. Kenya condemns the \r\nuse of economic coercive measures designed to prevent \r\ncountries from exercising the right to decide their own \r\npolitical, economic and social systems. Therefore, it \r\ncalls upon Member States not to recognize the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, which has had a negative impact on the \r\nwell-being of the Cuban people.\r\nKenya’s consistent opposition to the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba is also based on the fact that Cuba remains \r\nan integral part of the international community, and \r\nKenya maintains bilateral relations and cooperation \r\nwith Cuba. Kenya continues to engage with Cuba in \r\na constructive and mutually beneficial manner. In \r\naddition, Cuba, being an integral part of the international \r\ncommunity, should not be isolated or excluded from \r\nparticipation in regional and international processes. \r\nIndeed, Cuba itself has always remained very engaged \r\nwith the African continent. Few countries in the world \r\nhave shown the solidarity that Cuba has shown towards \r\nAfrica. Its contribution has been and continues to be \r\nmanifested through the provision of military, education \r\nand health assistance, as well as in a variety of other \r\nfields. Its particular focus on collaboration in the \r\nmedical field has also seen Cuba provide the largest \r\nnumber of doctors from any country to assist Africa in \r\ntackling the Ebola epidemic. That is a demonstration of \r\ntrue friendship and support from our Cuban brothers \r\nand sisters. We commend Cuba, we salute Cuba and we \r\ncelebrate Cuba.\r\nVarious United Nations agencies, including the \r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund and the United Nations \r\n6/8 14-59369\r\nA/69/PV.31 28/10/2014\r\nDevelopment Programme, have drawn the attention of \r\nMember States to the negative impacts of the embargo, \r\nparticularly to how the unilateral measures have harmed \r\nCuban children and hampered Cuba’s ability to acquire \r\nnecessary technical or medical equipment, especially \r\nthose materials that are under United States patent.\r\nKenya calls for the lifting of all unilateral measures \r\nthat affect or alter free trade and regional socioeconomic \r\ncooperation. The embargo, being extraterritorial in \r\nnature, violates international law and international \r\ntrade rules and runs counter to the principle of trade \r\nliberalization. It has constrained the efforts of the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba to eradicate poverty, \r\nimprove their living standards and achieve their desired \r\nlevel of economic and social development. \r\nIn Kenya, we believe that the principles of \r\nnon-intervention must be respected and upheld. The \r\nembargo represents a major impediment to the right \r\nof development of sovereign States and their peoples. \r\nThe right to development is a basic human, economic \r\nand cultural right. Therefore, the embargo remains an \r\nobstacle to the call for achieving the global development \r\nagenda expressed in the outcome document of the \r\nMillennium Summit (resolution 55/2).\r\nDespite the incredible challenges posed by the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba, Cuba’s \r\ncommitment to the social and economic progress and \r\nwell-being of other developing countries continues and \r\nis greatly appreciated. \r\nIn conclusion, Kenya reiterates its unwavering \r\nsupport for the right of the Cuban people to determine \r\ntheir social and economic development, in the manner \r\ndeemed most beneficial to them. The embargo must \r\nend.\r\nMr. Santa Rosa (Angola): Angola voted in favour \r\nof resolution 69/5, thereby reiterating its appeal for \r\nan end to the economic, trade and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba, \r\nsince the embargo also violates international law, the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe rules of free trade. The embargo stands as a clear \r\nviolation of human rights, as it affects the material, \r\npsychological and spiritual well-being of the Cuban \r\npeople, and imposes severe obstacles to their economic, \r\ncultural and social development, with a significant \r\nnegative impact on sensitive sectors such as health care, \r\neducation and food.\r\nAngola notes with concern the continuation and \r\nresurgence of the extraterritorial nature of the embargo, \r\nsince it amounts to interference by the United States \r\nin the affairs of the sovereign State of Cuba and the \r\nright of the Cuban people to freely determine their \r\nown political and economic system. It is unfortunate \r\nthat the United States has maintained its position \r\ndespite the visible progress that Cuba has achieved in \r\nvarious areas, particularly education and health, areas \r\nin which, in the context of international cooperation, \r\nCuba has helped several countries in need around the \r\nworld. Angola is grateful for and continues to benefit \r\nfrom that valuable assistance, especially in the areas of \r\neducation and health. A very recent example of Cuba’s \r\nassistance in health care is its valuable contribution to \r\nthe global effort to combat the Ebola epidemic affecting \r\nthe region of West Africa, by sending a number of \r\nhealth professionals who have been doing a remarkable \r\njob with positive results.\r\nThe Republic of Angola recognizes and once again \r\nencourages the Secretary-General’s efforts to put an end \r\nto the economic, trade and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States on Cuba for more than 50 years. In \r\nthat connection, we call on the international community \r\nto continue its efforts to promote a results-oriented \r\nand transparent dialogue between the two countries, \r\nwith a view to achieving a definitive solution to the \r\nproblem and normalization of the relations between \r\nthem, which is long overdue. Cuba and its people and \r\nGovernment can no longer continue to be prevented \r\nfrom participating fully in the development growth that \r\nis taking place in the economy of the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean region, where the United States is the \r\nkey player and should thus engage fully and freely with \r\nall the countries south of its border.\r\nIn calling for an end to this embargo we join the \r\ngreat majority of Member States, as well as many \r\nprestigious academic institutions and American \r\ncitizens, who are opposed to the embargo and urge for \r\na change in the current United States policy, in order \r\nto create an involvement that is conducive to peaceful \r\ncoexistence, constructive bilateral talks and peace in \r\nthe world.\r\nMr. Zamora Rivas (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We welcome the presence in the Assembly \r\ntoday of Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nEl Salvador associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Bolivia on behalf of the \r\n14-59369 7/8\r\n28/10/2014 A/69/PV.31\r\nGroup of 77 and China, and Costa Rica on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(see A/69/PV.30).\r\nI would like to make the following statement in the \r\nwake of El Salvador’s vote tiday in favour of resolution \r\n69/5, on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba.\r\nEl Salvador has always respected the principles and \r\npurposes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\ninternational law and multilateralism. We reaffirm our \r\nrejection of the unilateral application of economic and \r\ncommercial sanctions against another State that affect \r\nthe free development of international trade. \r\nToday the members of the international community \r\nare both witnesses to and instigators of great change. \r\nWe are living at a crucial time in the evolution of a \r\nnew generation of global opportunities and challenges, \r\nwhich demands that we define a new paradigm for \r\ndevelopment, cooperation and solidarity among the \r\npeoples of the world that we hope will be embodied in \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. In that context, as \r\nPresident Sánchez Cerén of the Republic of El Salvador \r\nsaid in his address at the general debate in September,\r\n“In our efforts in pursuit of peace and inclusive \r\nand equitable development, there is no place for \r\ncontempt for fundamental principles and freedoms. \r\nI refer here to the economic, trade and financial \r\nblockade against our sister Republic of Cuba, \r\nwhich, in spite of that unilateral action against its \r\npeople, has overcome the obstacles and adversity \r\nimposed on it”. (A/69/PV.12, p. 18)\r\nThe blockade ignores the principles framed in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and in international \r\ntreaties and the standards and customs of international \r\nlaw. It contravenes international trade and navigation \r\nregulations and the basic rules of peaceful coexistence \r\nand cooperation among nations. The embargo on Cuba \r\nis not only a unilateral act that lacks the support of \r\nthe international community, it has also continued in \r\nthe face of repeated condemnation on the part of the \r\nvast majority of the international community, as this \r\nmorning’s vote affirmed. In that regard, El Salvador \r\nwould like to emphasize the importance of compliance \r\nwith the provisions of resolution 47/19, adopted on \r\n24 November 1992, and of every resolution that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has adopted year after year between \r\nthen and now emphasizing the urgency of ending the \r\nUnited States embargo on Cuba.\r\nThe blockade of Cuba has had a concrete \r\nhumanitarian impact by limiting access to medicines \r\nand modern medical equipment and treatments, as \r\nwell as restricting the free exchange of science and \r\nknowledge between our countries and the right of \r\nAmericans to travel freely to Cuba. We also consider \r\nit especially harmful and unjust that the Office of \r\nForeign Assets Control of the Treasury Department of \r\nthe United States monitors any international financial \r\ntransaction involving Cuba, including with multilateral \r\ncooperative agencies, and thereby generating fines \r\non banks and other countries attempting to establish \r\neconomic, commercial, financial or scientific and \r\ntechnical relations with Cuba.\r\nAs a country committed to working for peaceful \r\ncoexistence among nations, El Salvador fully supports \r\nand has voted in favor of today’s resolution. In \r\nconclusion, I would like to emphasize the justice of \r\nthe Cuban cause in demanding an end to the embargo \r\nimposed by the United States and to reiterate the deep \r\nsympathy and solidarity of the people and Government \r\nof El Salvador with the people and Government of \r\nCuba’s cause. \r\nI would therefore like to end by expressing three \r\nhopes of our people and Government. The first is that \r\nthe Government of the United States will unilaterally \r\nlift the blockade, making a reality of the legal principle \r\nthat an act should be reversed in the same way that it was \r\noriginally carried out, and also respecting the universal \r\ncall that it should do so. Secondly, we hope that any \r\ndifferences between Cuba and the United States can \r\nbe resolved through dialogue and, thirdly, that after so \r\nmany years the people of the four Americas – North, \r\nSouth, Caribbean and Central – can sit around the same \r\ntable while excluding no one.\r\nMr. Lasso Mendoza (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the Republic of Ecuador, I am honoured \r\nto welcome the presence here of Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of our sister \r\nRepublic of Cuba, and laud the overwhelming outcome \r\nachieved today in favour of resolution 69/5, which \r\ncondemns the blockade imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba. The blockade not only \r\ncontravenes the fundamental norms and principles \r\nof international law; it is also unjust, immoral and a \r\nform of aggression, a blatant example of the fact that \r\n8/8 14-59369\r\nA/69/PV.31 28/10/2014\r\n“democracy”, this “democracy”, is an empty word \r\nwhose very meaning is distorted, a virtual game that \r\nbreaks its own rules.\r\nIt is perverse to continue to allow anyone to play \r\nwith human lives and for the well-being of an entire \r\npeople to be subject to the whim of a country that does \r\nnot want to accept the reality of a world in which no \r\nState has a privileged voice and where no country can \r\ntake unilateral action that runs counter to international \r\nnorms and principles. For that reason, Ecuador has \r\nalways voted and always will vote in favour of this \r\nresolution.\r\nWe would like also to note that the Cuban consulate \r\nin Washington, D.C., has been deprived of all financial \r\nservices. Such blindness can do unspeakable harm. In \r\ncontrast, Cuba gives everything it has, not whatever \r\nit has left over. I, as an Ecuadorian, have seen this. \r\nMy country’s successful programme for people with \r\ndisabilities is due partly to Cuba. As a citizen of this \r\nplanet, I have also witnessed Cuba’s quick, humane and \r\noutstanding response to the Ebola crisis.\r\nFor the twenty-third time, the vast majority of \r\nMember States have requested that an end be put to \r\nthis unjust and hostile unilateral embargo, which has \r\nno other solution than the United States abandoning its \r\nimperial intolerance. How much longer will we have to \r\nwait for this request to be granted, which will benefit \r\ninternational peace and security? It is high time that \r\nwe confronted the shameful double standard evidenced \r\nhere year after year when we speak of the rule of law, \r\nwith some countries invoking their principles when it \r\nsuits them and denying them when it runs counter to \r\ntheir own interests.\r\nMr. Suan (Myanmar): I am taking the f loor to \r\nexplain my delegation’s position on resolution 69/5, \r\nwhich was adopted earlier today by an overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States. \r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Bolivia on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, and the representative \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(see A/69/PV.30).\r\nSince the resolution was first introduced, at the \r\nforty-seventh session of the General Assembly, in \r\n1992, my delegation has taken the principled position \r\nof joining the international community every year in \r\ncalling for an end to the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba, which causes huge \r\neconomic losses and hardship to the Cuban people.\r\nAs a country having experienced similar unilateral \r\nsanctions for decades, Myanmar fully understands \r\nfrom its own experience the degree of suffering caused \r\nby the sanctions, which directly affect the innocent \r\npeople of the country.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nMyanmar has steadfastly adhered to the principled \r\nposition of the Movement in opposing the use of \r\nunilateral trade and economic sanctions. Therefore, \r\nMyanmar strongly supports the final document \r\nadopted at the seventeenth Ministerial Conference of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, held in Algeria earlier \r\nthis year, which calls for an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. The \r\nembargo is also contrary to the United Nations Charter \r\nas well as to international law and the principle of \r\ngood-neighbourliness.\r\nIn line with previous United Nations resolutions on \r\nthis item, we firmly believe that constructive dialogue \r\nis necessary to promote confidence and understanding. \r\nWe also believe that the embargo and coercive measures \r\nshould be replaced by dialogue and cooperation. For \r\nthose reasons, Myanmar has once again voted in favour \r\nof the resolution on the matter.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote after the voting.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 40?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.55 p.m.\r\n"
