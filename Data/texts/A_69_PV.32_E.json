Those 13 States therefore \r\nare not eligible in this election.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the \r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic \r\nand Social Council: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, \r\nEquatorial Guinea and Namibia for the four seats \r\namong the African States; the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nfor one of the four seats among the Asia-Pacific States; \r\nArmenia, Belarus and Ukraine for three seats among \r\nthe Eastern European States; Brazil, Cuba, Uruguay \r\nand the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the four \r\nseats among the Latin American and Caribbean States; \r\nand Italy for one of the five seats among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nall elections should be held by secret ballot and there \r\nshall be no nominations. However, I should like to \r\nrecall paragraph 16 of General Assembly decision \r\n34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing with the \r\nsecret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when \r\nthe number of candidates corresponds to the number \r\nof seats to be filled should become standard, unless \r\na delegation specifically requests a vote on the given \r\nelection.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: The number of States nominated \r\nfrom among the African States, the Asia-Pacific States, \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.32\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 29 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The General Assembly will be in \r\na position to act on those vacancies upon nomination by \r\nthe Economic and Social Council.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 112.\r\nAgenda item 111 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now \r\nproceed to the election of 18 members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council to replace those members whose \r\nterm of office expires on 31 December 2014.\r\nThe 18 outgoing members are: Austria, Belarus, \r\nBrazil, Burkina Faso, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, \r\nEl Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Greece, India, \r\nIndonesia, Japan, Lesotho, Libya, Nigeria and Portugal. \r\nPursuant to rule 146 of the rules of procedure, those \r\ncountries are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nAs of 1 January 2015, the following States will \r\nbe represented on the Economic and Social Council: \r\nAlbania, Antigua and Barbuda, Bangladesh, Benin, \r\nthe Plurinational State of Bolivia, Botswana, Canada, \r\nChina, Colombia, the Congo, Croatia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Congo, Denmark, Georgia, Guatemala, \r\nHaiti, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nMauritius, Nepal, New Zealand, Panama, the Republic \r\nof Korea, the Russian Federation, San Marino, Serbia, \r\nSouth Africa, the Sudan, Sweden, Togo, Tunisia, \r\nTurkmenistan, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland and the United States of America. \r\nThe names of those 36 States should therefore not \r\nappear on the ballots.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General \r\nAssembly resolution 2847 (XXVI), of 20 December \r\n1971, and taking into account the number of States that \r\nwill remain members of the Council after 1 January \r\n2015, the 18 members should be elected as follows: five \r\nfrom African States, three from Asia-Pacific States, \r\none from Eastern European States, four from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and five from Western \r\nEuropean and other States. The ballot papers reflect \r\nthat pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates - their number not exceeding the number of \r\nseats to be filled - that receive a two-thirds majority and \r\nthe greatest number of votes by members present and \r\nvoting, will be declared elected. Consistent with past \r\npractice, in the case of a tie vote making it necessary \r\nto determine the candidate to be elected or that will \r\nproceed to the next round of restricted balloting, there \r\nwill be a special restricted ballot limited to those \r\ncandidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthose procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidates of the respective regional \r\ngroups, the secretariat has been informed of the \r\nfollowing. For the five vacant seats from among \r\nthe African States, the Group has endorsed five \r\n14-59375 3/4\r\n29/10/2014 A/69/PV.32\r\ncandidates: Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mauritania, Uganda \r\nand Zimbabwe. For the three vacant seats from among \r\nthe Asia-Pacific States, the Group has endorsed three \r\ncandidates: India, Japan and Pakistan. For the one \r\nvacant seat from among the Eastern European States, \r\nthe Group has endorsed one candidate: Estonia. For \r\nthe four vacant seats from among the Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, the Group has endorsed four \r\ncandidates: Argentina, Brazil, Honduras and Trinidad \r\nand Tobago. For the five vacant seats from among the \r\nWestern European and other States, the Group has five \r\ncandidates: Austria, France, Germany, Greece and \r\nPortugal.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nwe shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representatives seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s name plate.\r\nI should like to seek the cooperation of the \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection. Please be reminded that during the voting \r\nprocess all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. That means in particular that once the \r\nmeeting has begun, no more campaign materials can \r\nbe distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are \r\nalso requested to remain in their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank \r\nmembers for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers are marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of \r\nthe States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be \r\ndeclared invalid if it contains more names of Member \r\nStates from the relevant region than the number of seats \r\nassigned to it. The ballot papers will also be declared \r\ninvalid if none of the names of the Member States on \r\nthat ballot belong to the relevant region. If the ballot \r\npaper of the region contains both names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to and that are outside that region, the \r\nballot remains valid but only the names of the Member \r\nStates that belong to the relevant region will be counted. \r\nThe names of Member States that do not belong to that \r\nregion will not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mr.  Dibaei \r\n(Islamic Republic of Iran), Mr. Zamporlini (Italy), \r\nMr. Birkays (Latvia), Mr. Hasler (Liechtenstein), \r\nMr. Lkhanaajav (Mongolia), Mr. Adejola (Nigeria), \r\nMr. Kayinamura (Rwanda) and Mr. Pérez Ayestarán \r\n(Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at noon.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  187\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  187\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  186\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  124\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGhana 185\r\nBurkina Faso  181\r\nUganda 181\r\nZimbabwe 178\r\nMauritania 177\r\nNigeria 2\r\nSwaziland 1\r\nSouth Sudan 1\r\nEthiopia 1\r\nMorocco 1\r\nGroup B — Asia-Pacific States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  187\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  187\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  186\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  124\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIndia 183\r\nJapan 181\r\nPakistan 181\r\nPalau 1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:  187\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  187\r\nAbstentions:  5\r\n4/4 14-59375\r\nA/69/PV.32 29/10/2014\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  182\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nEstonia  182\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nNumber of ballot papers:  187\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  187\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  186\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  124\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nBrazil 183\r\nTrinidad and Tobago  183\r\nArgentina  182\r\nHonduras 181\r\nUruguay 1\r\nChile 1\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  187\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  187\r\nAbstentions:  5\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  182\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nFrance  178\r\nGermany  178\r\nAustria  177\r\nGreece  177\r\nPortugal  177\r\nAustralia  2\r\nthe Netherlands 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nArgentina, Austria, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Estonia, \r\nFrance, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Honduras, \r\nIndia, Japan, Mauritania, Pakistan, Portugal, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Uganda and Zimbabwe \r\nwere elected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil for a three-year term of office beginning \r\non 1 January 2015.\r\nThe President: I congratulate those States that \r\nhave been elected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 111.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.\r\n"
