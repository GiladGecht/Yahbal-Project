"*1459630*\r\n14-59630 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.25 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Michael \r\nChilufya Sata, President of the Republic of Zambia\r\nThe President: Before we proceed to the items \r\non our agenda, it is my sad duty to pay tribute to the \r\nmemory of the late President of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, who passed \r\naway on Tuesday, 28 October 2014.\r\nOn behalf of the General Assembly, I request the \r\nrepresentative of Zambia to convey our condolences \r\nto the Government and people of Zambia and to \r\nthe bereaved family of His Excellency Mr. Michael \r\nChilufya Sata.\r\nI invite representatives to rise and observe a minute \r\nof silence in tribute to the memory of President Sata.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President: It was with deep personal sadness \r\nthat I learned of President Sata’s passing this week. \r\nOver the years, I had the pleasure of working with \r\nPresident Sata on many issues of mutual importance to \r\nour two countries. He was a remarkable man of peace, \r\nwhose efforts impacted not only the people of Zambia \r\nand the African continent but indeed the entire world. \r\nThe President’s work ethic and his tireless devotion to \r\nthe Zambian people will long be remembered, as will \r\nhis legendary journey to the highest political office in \r\nZambia.\r\nPresident Sata was one of a kind, and he will be \r\ngreatly missed. May his soul rest in eternal peace.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Zambia.\r\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia): I stand before the \r\nGeneral Assembly representing a nation in mourning. \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, President \r\nof the Republic of Zambia, passed away on the night \r\nof Tuesday, 28 October 2014 in London, where he had \r\ngone for medical attention. His death comes only four \r\ndays after the nation was awash with joy in celebrating \r\nits Golden Jubilee, marking 50 years of independence.\r\nBorn in 1937 in Mpika district in northern Zambia, \r\nthe late President Sata was the fifth President of the \r\nRepublic. He came into office in September 2011 after \r\nwinning the presidential elections and unseating the \r\nMovement for Multi-Party Democracy, which had ruled \r\nZambia for 20 years.\r\nPresident Sata was a prominent figure in the \r\npolitical history of Zambia. Before joining politics, he \r\nworked in various capacities, including the Police Force, \r\nLondon Transport, later as a business practitioner and \r\neventually easing naturally into the political sphere.\r\nThe late President’s political career began from \r\nthe lower ranks of ward councillor, gradually rising to \r\npolitical eminence through his election as President of \r\nthe Republic in 2011.\r\nThe Assembly may recall that in 1991 President \r\nSata was one of the prominent voices who left the \r\nGovernment to join the call for the reintroduction of \r\nmultiparty democracy. During that historic national \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.33\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n33rd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 30 October 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

He held \r\nvarious portfolios thereafter, including Minister for \r\nHealth, Minister for Local Government, Minister for \r\nLabour and District Governor for Lusaka, among others. \r\nHe was Minister without Portfolio, his last position \r\nbefore forming the Patriotic Front, after which he was \r\nNational Secretary of the ruling party. That made him \r\nthe third most senior politician in the hierarchy of the \r\nlate President Fredrick J.T. Chiluba’s Administration.\r\nOwing to his unique qualities, he was assigned some \r\nof the most challenging portfolios. Rather than deter \r\nhim, that pushed him to achieve astounding success, \r\nwhich further enhanced his political standing. The late \r\nPresident Sata believed in improving the welfare of \r\nall Zambians, especially women and children, and his \r\nnational appeal grew with time. He was a grass-roots \r\npolitician in the true sense of the word. His contribution \r\nto Zambia’s continued peace and tranquillity and to \r\nconsolidating the country’s democratic dispensation \r\nwas unparalleled. On two occasions, when multitudes \r\nof his supporters wanted to take to the streets in the \r\naftermath of the 2006 and 2008 general and presidential \r\nelections to contest the results, he appealed for calm and \r\nrestraint for the sake of national unity, thereby putting \r\nnational interest above self.\r\nThe late President almost single-handedly led his \r\npolitical party, the Patriotic Front. It grew from humble \r\nbeginnings to eventually dominating the Zambian \r\npolitical landscape. He contested the presidential \r\nelections immediately after resigning from the \r\nGovernment in 2001, in the subsequent elections of \r\n2006 and in the presidential by-election in 2008, before \r\nfinally recording a resounding victory at the 2011 \r\nelections. In his hallmark fashion, after each election he \r\nwould immediately launch the next elections campaign, \r\nstarting with a countrywide tour to thank those who \r\nhad voted for him. His voice in the political opposition \r\nwas thus a constant and effective threat to incumbent \r\nGovernments. President Sata was well known for \r\nhis brevity and candidness. He was also humorous \r\nand generous and exhibited a degree of humility and \r\nfriendliness rarely found in the powerful.\r\nZambia has lost an outstanding political organizer \r\nwho caused his political opponents to have sleepless \r\nnights. He will be fondly remembered as a man of \r\naction and as a President who contributed to Zambia’s \r\neconomic development through massive investments \r\nin infrastructure and who opened up Zambia’s \r\nintraconnectivity in an unprecedented manner in just \r\nthree years of his rule.\r\nThe late President Michael Sata was a key supporter \r\nof the United Nations, as its work resonated with his \r\nown passion for service to his fellow man. His addresses \r\nto the high-level segments of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-seventh and sixty-eighth sessions can attest to \r\nthat fact.\r\nOn behalf on the Government and people of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, I wish to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations - thanks to whom the Member States \r\nare observing this commemoration - and the entire \r\nUnited Nations membership, for joining hands with the \r\nZambian people at this moment of great loss. I want to \r\nassure everyone that our nation is greatly appreciative \r\nof their actions.\r\nI would like to end by informing the Assembly that \r\nthe transition process is now under way. In accordance \r\nwith the provisions of the Zambian Constitution, the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Zambia, Mr. Guy \r\nScott, is serving as Acting President, pending the \r\npresidential by-elections, which must be held within 90 \r\ndays of the incumbent’s death.\r\nThe Government is gratified that the Zambian \r\npeople continue to be united and that they are now, \r\nunited in grief, looking to pay their last respects to \r\ntheir late President in peace and dignity. We rely on \r\nthe solidarity and best wishes of our friends in the \r\ninternational community to overcome this national \r\ntragedy.\r\nMay the soul of our dearly departed President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, rest in eternal \r\npeace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, who \r\nwill speak on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nMr. Llorenty Solíz (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China to pay tribute to Mr. Michael \r\nSata, President of the Republic of Zambia, who passed \r\naway on 28 October 2014 at King Edward VII Hospital \r\nin London.\r\nOn behalf of the Group of 77 and China, I wish \r\nto express our solidarity with the Republic of Zambia \r\nand express our heartfelt condolences on the death \r\n14-59630 3/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nof President Sata, who became the fifth President of \r\nZambia on 23 September 2011 after a popular vote. \r\nHis achievements and efforts constitute an important \r\ncontribution to the development and growth of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia. Furthermore, the Group of 77 and \r\nChina will continue to support the valuable initiatives \r\nof that country.\r\nTo the people of Zambia, we know that words can \r\ngive little consolation to relieve grief, but we would \r\nlike to express our deep sorrow for the loss of such an \r\nimportant leader.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Malawi, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of African States.\r\nMr. Msosa (Malawi): The African Group wishes \r\nto offer its condolences to the Acting President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, Mr. Guy Scott, and to the people \r\nof Zambia for the loss of one of Africa’s finest leaders, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michael Sata, who passed away at \r\nthe age of 77 on 28 October 2014, in London.\r\nWe join the people of Zambia at this sad moment in \r\npaying tribute to a leader who devoted his whole life to \r\nwhat was right for the people of his country, the African \r\ncontinent and the whole world. President Sata was \r\na man of substance and vision. During his campaign \r\nfor the presidency he carried to his people a message \r\nof peaceful coexistence among all Zambians. He also \r\ncampaigned for the socioeconomic development of his \r\ncountry and strove to make Zambia prosper and reach \r\ngreater heights.\r\nAfrica will fondly remember President Sata as \r\na fearless freedom fighter, a reformer and one of the \r\narchitects of the liberation struggle that led to the \r\nindependence of Zambia and other African countries. \r\nWe know that the late President Sata will be missed by \r\nthose who knew him personally and officially for the \r\nideals that he firmly believed in and for his courage in \r\nensuring that his people were provided for in respect of \r\nthe basic needs they deserved and beyond.\r\nWe in the African Group are profoundly saddened \r\nby the loss of a true son of Zambia and Africa. He \r\nworked tirelessly to promote peace and stability, \r\nnot only for his own country but for the whole of the \r\nAfrican continent and beyond.\r\nIn this period of sorrow, the African Group wishes \r\nto urge all Zambians to remain calm, united and \r\npeaceful.\r\nMay his soul rest in peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Japan, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nAsia-Pacific Group.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I have the great honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Asia-Pacific Group at this solemn \r\ngathering of the General Assembly to pay tribute to the \r\nmemory of His Excellency Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata, \r\nthe late President of the Republic of Zambia.\r\nHistory will no doubt remember the late President \r\nSata as a man of conviction and action. Throughout his \r\nterm in office, which began in 2011, the late President \r\nworked diligently to improve the lives of ordinary \r\ncitizens. His strong leadership contributed profoundly \r\nto the betterment of Zambian society.\r\nHe implemented pro-poor and equitable development \r\npolicies and drew attention to the have-nots among the \r\nnation’s population. In particular, the late President \r\nachieved the provision of free medical services for \r\nthe people and built an additional 650 health posts \r\nthroughout the country. In the field of education, he \r\npromoted the construction of facilities for elementary \r\nand secondary schools, thereby doubling the number of \r\nschool buildings in Zambia. Furthermore, he vigorously \r\npromoted infrastructure development in rural areas.\r\nThe late President also underscored the importance \r\nof realizing social justice. He established an \r\nanti-corruption commission and increased the staff and \r\nbudget of the Auditor-General’s office.\r\nHe was also a strong supporter of the United \r\nNations. In his address to the General Assembly in \r\nSeptember 2013, which sadly turned out to be his last \r\nappearance on this rostrum, he solemnly declared his \r\nbelief in multilateralism and his determination to work \r\ntowards international peace and development through \r\nthe Organization (see A/68/PV.7).\r\nOne notable instance of his commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations was Zambia’s active role in addressing a \r\nnumber of the challenges facing landlocked developing \r\ncountries (LLDCs). The Zambian delegation, in its \r\ncapacity as Chair of the Group of LLDCs, has been \r\ntaking the lead in that field. His passing is undoubtedly \r\na tremendous loss for this world body.\r\nIn my national capacity, I would like to briefly \r\ntouch upon the privileged relationship that Japan has \r\nhad with Zambia and its late President.\r\n4/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of Zambian \r\nindependence. It was on the day of the closing ceremony \r\nof the Tokyo Summer Olympics of 1964 that Northern \r\nRhodesia became independent as Zambia. The athletes \r\nof the newly founded Zambia proudly marched onto \r\nthe field in Tokyo, brandishing their new national f lag. \r\nThe Japanese people were deeply impressed by their \r\nmarch, which symbolized their huge expectations for a \r\nbright future. Since then our two countries have been \r\nfostering strong and friendly relations. Japan’s Imperial \r\nHighnesses Prince and Princess Akishino visited \r\nZambia last July to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nbilateral diplomatic relations.\r\nThe late President Sata made significant \r\ncontributions to strengthening our bilateral ties. \r\nThrough his visits to Japan, including his official \r\nvisit in 2012 and his participation in the fifth Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference on African Development \r\nin 2013, he personally deepened exchanges with our \r\npeople.\r\nI myself had the honour of meeting with \r\nPresident Sata in January this year on the occasion \r\nof the African Union Summit in Addis Ababa. It was \r\ntherefore with great sadness that I learned of the sudden \r\npassing of the late President.\r\nThe world has lost a great politician. On this \r\nsolemn occasion, in my capacity as President of the \r\nAsia-Pacific Group for the month of October, I wish \r\nto convey my deepest condolences to the family of the \r\nlate President and to the Government and people of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia. It is our strong belief that Zambian \r\npeople have the strength to overcome this sadness and \r\nto continue to work towards further prosperity.\r\nMay his soul rest in peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Estonia, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Kolga (Estonia): It was with great sadness that \r\nI learned of the passing of His Excellency Mr. Michael \r\nChilufya Sata, President of the Republic of Zambia. As \r\nChairman of the Group of Eastern European States, \r\nplease allow me to express our deepest condolences to \r\nthe people of Zambia and to the family of late President \r\nSata in response to this sad news.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute \r\nto the late President, who was a well-respected member \r\nof the international community and a committed \r\nleader of the Zambian people. History will remember \r\nPresident Sata as a charismatic leader who will be \r\nremembered within his own nation as a passionate \r\ncompetitor, a true Zambian and a man of conviction and \r\ngreat determination. As has been noted by his friends, \r\nhe was extremely dedicated to anything that he decided \r\nto achieve. Throughout his political career, he played \r\nan important role in the public life of his country and \r\nremained a vocal advocate of the Zambian people. \r\nMay he rest in peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Grenada, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Antoine (Grenada): On behalf of the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States and the Permanent \r\nMission of Grenada, I convey my sincere condolences at \r\nthe passing of President Michael Chilufyua Sata to the \r\nPermanent Representative of Zambia and her staff, to \r\nthe family of the late President and to the Government \r\nand the people of Zambia.\r\nZambians to whom I have spoken have told me \r\nthat the late President was a man who worked hard for \r\nhis people, his country and Africa even years before \r\nhe became President. Throughout his political life and \r\nas President, he worked with passion for the poor and \r\nthe marginalized. President Sata was always a man \r\nof action. He was a policeman, a trade-union leader, \r\na railroad sweeper, a porter and a President. He was \r\na lifelong learner, graduating with a degree only in \r\n2011. But through it all, he never lost his common touch \r\nor his passion to improve the lives of his people. He \r\nwas a model of determination and is to be emulated by \r\npolitical leaders.\r\nIn celebrating his life, it is fitting to recall the \r\nlate President’s reform of the national health-care \r\nsystem during his tenure as Minister for Health - an \r\naccomplishment worth taking note of in the face of the \r\nhealth-care challenges in Africa today. In the words of \r\na poet,\r\n“To earn the appreciation of honest critics and \r\nendure the betrayal of false friends; To appreciate \r\nthe beauty, to find the best in others; ... To leave \r\nthe world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, \r\na garden patch, a redeemed social condition; ... To \r\nknow even one life has breathed easier because you \r\nhave lived – This is to succeed.”\r\n14-59630 5/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nMichael Sata succeeded. The passing of the Head \r\nof State of Zambia, a man of courage, who died in the \r\nsearch for sustainable development in his country, \r\ndiminishes us all.\r\nMay his soul rest in peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Western European and other States.\r\nMr. Thöresson (Sweden): On this very solemn \r\noccasion, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Western European and other States. It is with \r\nprofound sadness and great sorrow that we learned of \r\nthe passing of the President of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Michael Chilufya Sata.\r\nWe just celebrated Zambia’s Golden Jubilee last \r\nweek on 24 October. History will remember President \r\nSata as a leader committed to building his country \r\nduring its first 50 years of independence. We recognize \r\nhis many accomplishments and his desire to achieve the \r\npolitical and economic development of Zambia.\r\nThroughout his term in office, President Sata was \r\ncommitted the cause of social justice, paying particular \r\nattention to the country’s youth. Under his leadership, \r\nZambia continued to make great strides towards \r\nachieving the eight Millennium Development Goals, \r\nparticularly with respect to primary school enrolment \r\nand the fight against child malnutrition and malaria.\r\nWe offer our profound condolences to the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nto his wife, Dr. Christine Kaseba Sata, to his family and \r\nrelatives, as well as to our dear friends and colleagues \r\nat the Mission of Zambia here in New York.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States of America, who \r\nwill speak on behalf of the host country.\r\nMr. Pressman (United States of America): On \r\nbehalf of the United States of America, I would like \r\nto express my Government’s deep condolences on the \r\npassing of Zambian President Michael Chilufya Sata. \r\nWe extend our sympathies to the President’s family and \r\nto the people of Zambia during this time of mourning.\r\nWe honour President Sata’s years of service to his \r\ncountry and his leadership in the Southern African \r\nregion. His many accomplishments will be remembered \r\nwith respect.\r\nWe note that the passing of President Sata came just \r\ndays after Zambia celebrated 50 years of independence. \r\nThe United States has considered itself a friend of \r\nthe people of Zambia throughout that time, and has \r\nrecognized Zambia’s strong democratic tradition. As \r\nPresident Obama wrote to President Sata on 21 October:\r\n“The United States Government has been proud to \r\ncount Zambia as a partner of Zambia’s first 50 years, \r\nand we look forward to growing that partnership in \r\nthe years ahead.” \r\nWe offer our deep condolences.\r\nAgenda item 70\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice (A/69/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/69/337)\r\nThe President: I welcome The Honourable \r\nJudge Peter Tomka, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, to the General Assembly, who will present \r\nthis year’s report on the activities of the Court (A/69/4).\r\nThe role of the International Court of Justice in \r\napplying the principles and norms of international law \r\nis essential for the promotion of the rule of law, friendly \r\nrelations among States and, ultimately, for international \r\npeace and security. This year’s report shows increased \r\njudicial activity and sustained efforts to handle \r\nproceedings more expeditiously. Several new cases \r\nintroduced during the reporting period demonstrate \r\nthat States from all regions of the world have gained \r\nstrong confidence in the Court and its capacity to \r\ndeliver justice.\r\nIt is now my honour to give the floor to Judge Tomka.\r\nMr. Tomka, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice: Before presenting the report on the activities \r\nof the Court (A/69/4), I wish to join those who have \r\npaid tribute to the late President Michael Chilufya Sata \r\nof Zambia and to express, on behalf of the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, our heartfelt \r\nsympathy and condolences to the Government and the \r\npeople of Zambia.\r\nI would like to thank the General Assembly for \r\ncontinuing the practice of allowing the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to present a review of the \r\nCourt’s judicial activities over the previous year. This \r\n6/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\npractice reflects the interest in, and support for, the \r\nCourt shown by the Assembly.\r\nDuring the past 12 months the Court has continued \r\nto fulfil its role as the forum of choice for States for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of every kind of international \r\ndispute over which it has jurisdiction. As illustrated in \r\nthe report that I have the honour to present to Member \r\nStates today, the Court has made every effort to meet in a \r\ntimely manner the expectations of the parties appearing \r\nbefore it, particularly when it has been presented with \r\nrequests for the indication of provisional measures.\r\nDuring the reporting period the total number of \r\ncontentious cases pending before the Court was 13; it \r\nnow stands at 14. The Court held hearings in four cases.\r\nFirst, the Court held hearings on three requests \r\nfor provisional measures: in October 2013, in the case \r\nCertain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border \r\nArea (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), which was joined with \r\nthe case Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the \r\nSan Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica); in November \r\n2013, in the case Construction of a Road in Costa Rica \r\nalong the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica); and \r\nin January 2014, in Questions relating to the Seizure and \r\nDetention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste \r\nv. Australia). Then, in March 2014, it held hearings on \r\nthe merits in the case Application of the Convention on \r\nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \r\n(Croatia v. Serbia). The Court is now deliberating that \r\ncase and is currently in the process of drafting its \r\njudgment, which it plans to deliver before the triennial \r\nrenewal of its composition next February.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court also \r\ndelivered three judgments: the first in the case Request \r\nfor Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the \r\nCase concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia \r\nv. Thailand) (Cambodia v. Thailand), the second in the \r\ncase Maritime Dispute (Peru v. Chile) and the third in \r\nthe case Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan). \r\nIn addition, it handed down three orders on requests for \r\nthe indication of provisional measures.\r\nAs is traditional, I shall now report briefly on the \r\nmain decisions of the Court during the past year. I \r\nshall deal first with each of the three aforementioned \r\njudgments, before turning to the orders made in the \r\ncase Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua in \r\nthe Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and the \r\ncase Construction of a Road in Costa Rica along the \r\nSan Juan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), and in the \r\ncase Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of \r\nCertain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia).\r\nThe first judgment delivered by the Court during \r\nthe period under review was given on 11 November \r\n2013 in the case Request for Interpretation of the \r\nJudgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning \r\nthe Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand). The proceedings concerning \r\nthe interpretation were instituted on 28 April 2011 \r\nby the Kingdom of Cambodia, which requested the \r\nCourt to interpret the Judgment delivered by the Court \r\non 15 June 1962. The Court was seized following \r\nincidents between Cambodia and Thailand in the \r\nborder area close to the Temple. In its application, \r\nCambodia contended that, even though “Thailand d[id] \r\nnot dispute Cambodia’s sovereignty over the Temple”, \r\nit nevertheless called into question the 1962 Judgment \r\nin its entirety by “refus[ing] Cambodia’s sovereignty \r\nover the area beyond the Temple as far as its vicinity”. \r\nThe applicant therefore asked the Court to interpret its \r\n1962 Judgment, in which it had stated, in the second \r\noperative paragraph, that Thailand was under an \r\nobligation to withdraw any personnel stationed by it “at \r\nthe Temple, or in its vicinity on Cambodian territory”.\r\nIn its judgment rendered on 11 November 2013, \r\nthe Court first considered whether it had jurisdiction \r\nand whether Cambodia’s request for interpretation \r\nwas admissible. That request was made pursuant to \r\nArticle 60 of the Statute of the Court, which provides \r\nthat “In the event of dispute as to the meaning or scope \r\nof [a] judgment, the Court shall construe it upon the \r\nrequest of any party”. After examining whether the \r\nconditions set out in Article 60 were satisfied, the \r\nCourt concluded that there was a dispute between \r\nthe parties as to the meaning and scope of the 1962 \r\nJudgment. It noted, in that respect, that the principal \r\ndispute concerned the territorial scope of the second \r\noperative paragraph, namely, the territorial extent of \r\nthe “vicinity” of the Temple of Preah Vihear.\r\nThe Court considered that from the reasoning in the \r\n1962 judgment, seen in the light of the pleadings in the \r\noriginal proceedings, the second operative paragraph \r\nof the 1962 judgment required Thailand to withdraw \r\nfrom the whole of the territory of the promontory of \r\nPreah Vihear any Thai personnel stationed there. \r\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that the terms \r\n“vicinity on Cambodian territory” had to be construed \r\nas extending at least to the area where, at the time of \r\nthe original proceedings, a Thai police detachment was \r\n14-59630 7/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nfound to have been stationed. The Court observed that \r\nthat conclusion was confirmed by a number of other \r\nfactors, in particular the fact that the area around the \r\nTemple is located on an easily identifiable geographical \r\nfeature – a promontory.\r\nTo the east, south and south-west, the promontory \r\ndrops in a steep escarpment to the Cambodian \r\nplain. The parties were in agreement in 1962 that \r\nthat escarpment and the land at its foot were under \r\nCambodian sovereignty in any event. To the west and \r\nnorth-west, the land drops in a slope, less steep than the \r\nescarpment but nonetheless pronounced, into the valley \r\nwhich separates Preah Vihear from the neighbouring \r\nhill of Phnom Trap, a valley which itself drops away in \r\nthe south to the Cambodian plain.\r\nThe Court found that Phnom Trap lay outside \r\nthe disputed area and that the 1962 Judgment did not \r\naddress the question of whether it was located in Thai or \r\nCambodian territory. Accordingly, the Court considered \r\nthat the promontory of Preah Vihear ended at the foot of \r\nthe hill of Phnom Trap, that is to say where the ground \r\nbegins to rise from the valley. In the north, it concluded \r\nthat the reasoning in the 1962 Judgment showed that the \r\nCourt considered Cambodia’s territory to extend as far \r\nas the line on the map annexed to its pleadings in the \r\noriginal proceedings, the so-called annex I map, which \r\nhad been accepted by the parties. It therefore ruled that \r\nin the north the limit of the promontory is the annex I \r\nmap line, from a point to the north-east of the Temple \r\nwhere that line abuts the escarpment to a point in the \r\nnorth-west where the ground begins to rise from the \r\nvalley at the foot of the hill of Phnom Trap.\r\nThe Court then examined the relationship between \r\nthe second operative paragraph and the rest of the \r\noperative part of the Judgment. It considered that the \r\nterritorial scope of the three operative paragraphs was \r\nthe same: the finding in the first paragraph that “the \r\nTemple of Preah Vihear is situated in territory under the \r\nsovereignty of Cambodia” must be taken as referring, \r\nlike the second and third paragraphs, to the whole of the \r\nterritory of the promontory of Preah Vihear.\r\nFinally, the Court observed that the Temple of Preah \r\nVihear is a site of religious and cultural significance for \r\nthe peoples of the region and is now listed by UNESCO \r\nas a world heritage site. In that respect, it recalled that \r\nunder article 6 of the 1972 Convention concerning the \r\nProtection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage, \r\nto which both States are parties, Cambodia and \r\nThailand must cooperate between themselves and with \r\nthe international community in the protection of the site \r\nas world heritage. In addition, each State is under an \r\nobligation not to “take any deliberate measures which \r\nmight damage directly or indirectly” such heritage. In \r\nthe context of those obligations, the Court emphasized \r\nthe importance of ensuring access to the Temple from \r\nthe Cambodian plain.\r\nIn the operative part of its Judgment, the Court \r\nfound that Cambodia had sovereignty over the \r\nwhole territory of the promontory of Preah Vihear, \r\nas previously defined, and that, as a consequence, \r\nThailand was under an obligation to withdraw from \r\nthat territory the Thai military or police forces or other \r\nguards or keepers that were stationed there.\r\nAlso during the review period, on 27 January \r\n2014, the Court handed down a second judgment, on \r\ndelimitation of the boundary between the maritime \r\nzones of Peru and Chile in the Pacific Ocean - Maritime \r\nDispute (Peru v. Chile). Peru argued that no agreed \r\nmaritime boundary existed between itself and Chile, \r\nand asked the Court to draw a boundary line using the \r\nequidistance method in order to achieve an equitable \r\nresult. Chile, on the other hand, contended that it was \r\nnot for the Court to draw a boundary line, since an \r\ninternational maritime boundary agreed on between the \r\nparties already existed. According to Chile, it followed \r\nthe parallel of latitude passing through the starting \r\npoint of the Peru-Chile land boundary and extended to \r\na minimum of 200 nautical miles, as indicated on the \r\nmap distributed.\r\nIn order to resolve the dispute, the Court first \r\nsought to ascertain whether, as Chile claimed, an \r\nagreed maritime boundary already existed. To that \r\nend, it examined various instruments submitted to it by \r\nthe parties, and in particular the 1947 proclamations, \r\nwhereby Peru and Chile had each unilaterally \r\nproclaimed certain maritime rights extending 200 \r\nnautical miles from their respective coasts, as well as \r\nthe 1952 Santiago Declaration on the Maritime Zone, in \r\nwhich Chile, Ecuador and Peru\r\n“proclaim[ed] as a norm of their international \r\nmaritime policy that they each possess[ed] exclusive \r\nsovereignty and jurisdiction of the sea along the \r\ncoasts of their respective countries to a minimum \r\ndistance of 200 nautical miles from those coasts”.\r\nThe Court found, however, that none of those \r\ninstruments established a maritime boundary between \r\nPeru and Chile.\r\n8/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nThe Court then proceeded to examine a series of \r\nsubsequent agreements and arrangements between \r\nPeru, Chile and Ecuador. In particular, it analysed a \r\ndocument dating from 1954, the Agreement relating to \r\na Special Maritime Frontier Zone, which established a \r\nzone of tolerance, starting at a distance of 12 nautical \r\nmiles from the coast, “of 10 nautical miles on either \r\nside of the parallel which constitutes the maritime \r\nboundary”. The Court found that the terms of that \r\ninstrument acknowledged, in a binding international \r\nagreement, that a maritime boundary already existed. \r\nThe Court noted, however, that the text did not indicate \r\nwhen and how that boundary had been agreed on. The \r\nCourt therefore concluded that the parties’ express \r\nacknowledgement of the existence of a maritime \r\nboundary could only reflect a tacit agreement that they \r\nhad reached earlier and that had been cemented by the \r\n1954 Special Maritime Frontier Zone Agreement. The \r\nCourt observed, however, that that Agreement gave no \r\nindication as to the nature of the maritime boundary, \r\nnor did it indicate its extent, although its terms made \r\nit clear that the maritime boundary extended beyond \r\n12 nautical miles from the coast.\r\nIn the light of that finding, the Court then addressed \r\nthe question of the nature of the agreed maritime \r\nboundary. Pointing out that the tacit agreement between \r\nthe parties should be understood in the context of the \r\n1947 proclamations and the 1952 Santiago Declaration, \r\nwhich expressed claims to the seabed and to the \r\nwaters above the seabed and their resources, with no \r\ndistinction drawn between those spaces by the parties, \r\nthe Court concluded that the maritime boundary was an \r\nall-purpose one.\r\nThe Court then sought to determine the extent of \r\nthe agreed maritime boundary. It began by examining \r\nthe practice of the parties in the early and mid-1950s, \r\nstarting with fishing potential and activity. The Court \r\nnoted that the information referred to by the parties \r\nshowed that the species that were being taken in the \r\nearly 1950s were generally to be found within a range \r\nof 60 nautical miles from the coast. While recalling \r\nthat, given the maritime boundary’s all-purpose nature, \r\nevidence concerning fisheries activity could not in itself \r\nbe determinative of the boundary’s extent, the Court \r\nbelieved that those activities appeared to indicate that, \r\nat the time when the parties acknowledged the existence \r\nof an agreed maritime boundary between them, they \r\nwere unlikely to have considered that it extended all the \r\nway to the 200-nautical-mile limit.\r\nThe Court then moved on to the broader context \r\nand examined the development of the law of the sea \r\nat the start of the 1950s. In particular, it observed that \r\nclaims to a maritime zone of at least 200 nautical miles, \r\nsuch as those made by the parties in the 1952 Santiago \r\nDeclaration, did not correspond to the international law \r\nof the period. On the basis of the parties’ fishing activities \r\nat that time, the relevant practice of other States and the \r\nwork of the International Law Commission on the law \r\nof the sea, the Court considered that the evidence at \r\nits disposal did not allow it to conclude that the agreed \r\nmaritime boundary along the parallel extended beyond \r\n80 nautical miles from its starting point. In the light of \r\nthat tentative conclusion, the Court examined further \r\nelements of practice, for the most part subsequent to \r\n1954, but concluded that they did not lead it to change \r\nits position.\r\nThe Court then turned to the question of the \r\nstarting point of the agreed maritime boundary. After \r\npaying particular attention to the documents that had \r\nled to the conclusion of arrangements whereby, in 1968 \r\nand 1969, the parties decided to construct lighthouses \r\n“to materialize the parallel of the maritime frontier \r\noriginating at” the first boundary marker along the land \r\nfrontier, the Court concluded that the starting point of \r\nthe maritime boundary between the parties was located \r\nat the intersection of the low waterline with the parallel \r\nof latitude passing through Boundary Marker No. 1.\r\nThe Court next proceeded to its determination of \r\nthe course of the maritime boundary from the end point \r\nof the agreed line. For that purpose, it applied its usual \r\nmethod, as explained in detail in its 2009 Judgment \r\nin the case concerning Maritime Delimitation in the \r\nBlack Sea (Romania v. Ukraine). The Court concluded \r\nthat the maritime boundary between the parties starts \r\nat the intersection of the parallel of latitude passing \r\nthrough Boundary Marker No. I with the low waterline, \r\nand extends for 80 nautical miles along that parallel \r\nof latitude to a point indicated on map No. 4, which \r\nhas been circulated, as Point A. From that point, the \r\nmaritime boundary runs along the equidistance line \r\nto the point indicated on the map as Point B, and then \r\nalong the 200-nautical-mile limit measure from the \r\nChilean baselines to the point indicated as Point C.\r\nBefore concluding my summary of this case, I \r\nwould like to draw the Assembly’s attention to Peru’s \r\nsecond submission, in which it requested the Court to \r\nadjudge and declare that, beyond the point where the \r\ncommon maritime boundary ended, it was entitled to \r\n14-59630 9/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nexercise sovereign rights over a maritime area lying out \r\nto a distance of 200 nautical miles from its baselines. \r\nThe claim related to the area shown in a darker shade \r\nof blue in sketch map No. 2, which I understand has \r\nbeen circulated. The Court held, however, that, since \r\nit had already concluded that the agreed boundary \r\nended at 80 nautical miles from the coast and that it \r\nhad further decided that beyond that point it would \r\ndelimit the parties’ maritime entitlements by drawing \r\nan equidistance line, Peru’s second submission had \r\nbecome moot. The Court therefore did not rule on it.\r\nIn the light of the particular circumstances of the \r\ncase, the Court determined the course of the maritime \r\nboundary between the parties without specifying its \r\nprecise geographical coordinates. It recalled that in \r\ntheir final submissions the parties had not requested \r\nthat the Court do so. The Court accordingly invited Peru \r\nand Chile to determine those coordinates in accordance \r\nwith its judgment, in a spirit of good neighbourliness, \r\nand the two States indeed proceeded to do so, just a \r\nfew months after the Court handed down its decision. It \r\nis therefore worth emphasizing that within two months \r\nfrom the delivery of the judgment, the two parties \r\nand their Governments reached a joint agreement on \r\nthe precise geographical coordinates of their maritime \r\nboundary on the basis of the description set out in the \r\nCourt’s Judgment.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOn 31 March 2014, the Court handed down a \r\nthird judgment, in the case concerning Whaling in \r\nthe Antarctic (Australia v. Japan), with New Zealand \r\nintervening under Article 63 of the Statute. The \r\nproceedings had been instituted in May 2010 by \r\nAustralia, who accused Japan of the\r\n“continued pursuit of a large-scale program of \r\nwhaling under the Second Phase of its Japanese \r\nWhale Research Program under Special Permit in \r\nthe Antarctic (‘JARPA II’), in breach of obligations \r\nassumed by Japan under the International \r\nConvention for the Regulation of Whaling ... as \r\nwell as its other international obligations for the \r\npreservation of marine mammals and the marine \r\nenvironment”.\r\nIn order to decide on the dispute, the Court began \r\nby addressing the issue of its jurisdiction, which Japan \r\ncontested on the ground that the dispute fell within \r\nthe scope of a reservation in Australia’s declaration \r\nof acceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. \r\nIn the Court’s view, however, that reservation applied \r\nonly where there was a dispute between the parties over \r\nmaritime delimitation, which was not the case here. \r\nThe Court accordingly concluded that Japan’s objection \r\nto jurisdiction could not be upheld.\r\nThe Court then turned to the core of the case \r\n- the interpretation and application of article VIII of \r\nthe International Convention for the Regulation of \r\nWhaling, of which the relevant part of paragraph 1 \r\nreads as follows:\r\n“Notwithstanding anything contained in \r\nthis Convention any Contracting Government \r\nmay grant to any of its nationals a special permit \r\nauthorizing that national to kill, take and treat \r\nwhales for purposes of scientific research subject to \r\nsuch restrictions as to number and subject to such \r\nother conditions as the Contracting Government \r\nthinks fit.”\r\nIn regard to the interpretation of that provision, the \r\nCourt began by observing that, although article VIII \r\ngives discretion to a State party to the Convention \r\nto reject a request for a special permit or to specify \r\nthe conditions for the granting of such a permit, the \r\nanswer to the question of whether the killing, taking \r\nand treatment of whales pursuant to a requested special \r\npermit was for purposes of scientific research could not \r\ndepend simply on that State’s perception. The Court \r\nthen discussed the meaning of the phrase “for purposes \r\nof scientific research” in that article, concluding that \r\nthe two elements of that phrase were cumulative. As a \r\nresult, even if a whaling programme involved scientific \r\nresearch, the killing, taking and treating of marine \r\nmammals pursuant to such a programme did not fall \r\nwithin article VIII unless those activities were for \r\npurposes of scientific research.\r\nRegarding the application of paragraph 1 of \r\narticle VIII, the Court found that JARPA II could \r\ngenerally be characterized as a scientific research \r\nprogramme. The Court then sought to ascertain whether \r\nthe use of lethal methods was for purposes of scientific \r\nresearch, and to that end, it considered whether the \r\nelements of the programme’s design and implementation \r\nwere reasonable in relation to its stated research \r\nobjectives. In that connection, the Court examined, \r\ninter alia, the following elements: decisions regarding \r\nthe use of lethal methods, the scale of the programme’s \r\nuse of lethal sampling, the methodology used to select \r\nsample sizes, a comparison of the target sample sizes \r\nand the actual take, the time frame associated with the \r\n10/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nprogramme, the programme’s scientific output, and \r\nthe degree to which the programme coordinated its \r\nactivities with related research projects.\r\nFrom its examination, the Court concluded that \r\nwhile JARPA II, taken as a whole, involved activities \r\nthat could broadly be characterized as scientific \r\nresearch, “the evidence [did] not establish that \r\ndesign and implementation of the programme [were] \r\nreasonable in relation to stated objectives”. The Court \r\nconcluded that the special permits granted by Japan for \r\nthe killing, taking and treating of whales in connection \r\nwith JARPA II were not “for purposes of scientific \r\nresearch” pursuant to article VIII, paragraph 1, of the \r\nConvention.\r\nThe Court next turned to the implications of \r\nthat conclusion, in the light of Australia’s contention \r\nthat Japan had breached several provisions of the \r\nSchedule appended to the Convention. In the view \r\nof the Court, despite the differences in wording, all \r\nwhaling activities that did not fall within the terms \r\nof article VIII of the Convention, with the exception \r\nof aboriginal subsistence whaling, were covered by \r\nthree specific provisions of the Schedule. The Court \r\naccordingly concluded that Japan had breached, first, \r\nthe moratorium on commercial whaling for each of the \r\nyears in which it had set catch limits above zero for \r\nminke whales, fin whales and humpback whales under \r\nJARPA II; secondly, the factory ship moratorium, \r\nfor each of the seasons during which fin whales were \r\ntaken, killed and treated under JARPA II; and thirdly, \r\nthe ban on commercial whaling in the Southern Ocean \r\nSanctuary, for each of the JARPA II seasons during \r\nwhich fin whales had been taken. However, the Court \r\nheld that, contrary to what Australia had claimed, Japan \r\nhad met the requirements of a further provision of the \r\nSchedule, whereby every contracting Government must \r\nmake proposed permits available to the International \r\nWhaling Commission in sufficient time to permit \r\nreview and comment by the Scientific Committee.\r\nIn the light of its findings, the Court then \r\naddressed the issue of remedies. The Court noted that \r\nJARPA II was an ongoing programme and that under the \r\ncircumstances, measures going beyond a declaratory \r\njudgment were warranted. It therefore ordered Japan to \r\nrevoke any extant authorization, permit or licence to \r\nkill, take or treat whales in relation to JARPA II and \r\nrefrain from granting any further permits under article \r\nVIII, paragraph 1, of the Convention in pursuance of \r\nthe JARPA II programme. On the other hand, the Court \r\nsaw no need to order the additional remedy requested \r\nby Australia, which would require Japan to refrain \r\nfrom authorizing or implementing any special-permit \r\nwhaling that was not for purposes of scientific research \r\nwithin the meaning of article VIII. In the Court’s view, \r\nthat obligation already applied to all State parties.\r\nI should also like to take the opportunity to draw \r\nthe Assembly’s attention to the fact that the Court has \r\nmade increasing use of the deliberation procedure \r\nprovided for in article 1 of the resolution concerning \r\nthe Internal Judicial Practice of the Court, whose first \r\nparagraph provides that:\r\n“After the termination of the written \r\nproceedings before the beginning of the oral \r\nproceedings, a deliberation is held at which the \r\njudges exchange views concerning the case, and \r\nbring to the notice of the Court any point in regard \r\nto which they consider it may be necessary to \r\ncall for explanations during the course of the oral \r\nproceedings”.\r\nSuch deliberations effectively enable the Court \r\nto identify any issue on which it would like further \r\nexplanation or clarification during the oral proceedings \r\non the substance of a case. Thus, once it has completed \r\nits deliberations, the Court communicates its queries \r\nto the parties with a view to directing their oral \r\npresentations towards providing the additional \r\ninformation needed by the Court at the hearings. It is a \r\nprocedure that is particularly useful in cases with major \r\nscientific content, or where the factual background is \r\na particularly complex one. The Court did indeed hold \r\nsuch a deliberation in the Whaling case, as well as in the \r\ncase between Ecuador and Colombia concerning Aerial \r\nHerbicide Spraying (Ecuador v. Colombia), which was \r\nsettled by the parties before the opening of the hearings \r\non the merits.\r\nAs I have already noted, during the reporting \r\nperiod the Court also handed down three orders, which \r\nI will briefly present in chronological order.\r\nThe first of them was issued on 22 November 2013 \r\nin the case concerning Certain Activities carried out by \r\nNicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua). \r\nThat decision followed a request for the indication of \r\nnew provisional measures submitted on 24 September \r\n2013 by Costa Rica, protesting Nicaragua’s construction \r\nof two new caños, or canals, in the “disputed territory”, \r\nas defined by the Court in an order for the indication \r\nof provisional measures of 8 March 2011, namely, the \r\n14-59630 11/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nnorthern part of Isla Portillos, that is to say, the area of \r\nwetlands of some 3 square kilometres between the right \r\nbank of the disputed caño, the right bank of the San \r\nJuan River up to its mouth at the Caribbean Sea and the \r\nHarbour Head Lagoon.\r\nIn its order of 22 November 2013, the Court held \r\nthat there was sufficient evidence before it for it to \r\nconclude that, given the length, width and location of \r\na trench dug close to the larger of the two new canals - \r\nthe eastern caño - there was a real risk of its reaching \r\nthe Caribbean Sea as a result of either natural or human \r\naction, or of a combination of the two. That could cause \r\nthe San Juan River to change its course, with serious \r\nconsequences for the rights claimed by Costa Rica \r\nin the case. The Court therefore decided not only to \r\nreiterate the provisional measures indicated by it in its \r\norder of 8 March 2011, but also to order new measures. \r\nIt stated that Nicaragua must refrain from any dredging \r\nand other activities in the disputed territory and must, \r\nin particular, refrain from work of any kind on the two \r\nnew caños and fill in the trench on the beach north of \r\nthe eastern caño.\r\nA few weeks later, on 13 December 2013, the \r\nCourt handed down an order in the case concerning the \r\nConstruction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San \r\nJuan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica). In its request \r\nfor the indication of provisional measures, Nicaragua \r\nstated that it was seeking to protect certain rights \r\nwhich it claimed were threatened by road works being \r\ncarried out by Costa Rica, in particular the resultant \r\ntransboundary movement of sediment and other debris.\r\nThe Court, however, found that the circumstances as \r\nthey then presented themselves to it were not such as to \r\nrequire the exercise of its power to indicate provisional \r\nmeasures. In particular, the Court considered that \r\nNicaragua had not established that the construction \r\nworks had led to a substantial increase in the sediment \r\nload in the river and had not presented evidence as \r\nto any long-term effect on the river resulting from \r\naggradations of the river channel allegedly caused by \r\nadditional sediment from the construction of the road. \r\nNor had the applicant explained how certain species in \r\nthe river’s wetlands could be endangered by the road \r\nworks, or identified with precision which species were \r\nlikely to be affected.\r\nLastly, the Court handed down a third order for \r\nthe indication of provisional measures in the case \r\nconcerning Questions relating to the Seizure and \r\nDetention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste \r\nv. Australia). That decision followed a request submitted \r\non 17 December 2013 by Timor-Leste on account \r\nof the seizure on 3 December 2013 and subsequent \r\ndetention by “agents of Australia of documents, data \r\nand other property which belongs to Timor-Leste and/\r\nor which Timor-Leste has the right to protect under \r\ninternational law”. Timor-Leste claimed that the items \r\nseized included documents, data and correspondence \r\nbetween Timor-Leste and its legal advisers relating to \r\nthe pending Arbitration under the Timor Sea Treaty of \r\n20 May 2002 between Timor-Leste and Australia.\r\nIn its decision of 3 March 2014, the Court took the \r\nview that if Australia failed to immediately safeguard \r\nthe confidentiality of the material seized by its agents \r\non 3 December 2013, the right of Timor-Leste to \r\nconduct arbitral proceedings and negotiations without \r\ninterference could suffer irreparable harm. The Court \r\nnoted, however, that the Attorney-General of Australia \r\nhad given a written undertaking on 21 January 2014 that \r\nincluded an assurance that the seized material would \r\nnot be made available to any part of the Australian \r\nGovernment for any purpose in connection with the \r\nexploitation of resources in the Timor Sea or related \r\nnegotiations or in connection with the conduct of the \r\ncurrent case before the Court or the proceedings of the \r\nTimor Sea Treaty Tribunal.\r\nNonetheless, after taking cognizance of the fact \r\nthat in certain circumstances involving national \r\nsecurity, the Government of Australia envisaged the \r\npossibility of making use of the seized material, the \r\nCourt took the view that while the written undertaking \r\nmade a significant contribution towards mitigating the \r\nimminent risk of irreparable prejudice to Timor-Leste’s \r\nrights caused by the seizure of the above-mentioned \r\nmaterial, it did not remove that risk entirely. The Court \r\naccordingly concluded that the conditions required by \r\nits Statute for it to indicate provisional measures had \r\nbeen met. Furthermore, on 3 September the Court \r\ndecided to accept a joint request from the parties for the \r\noral proceedings between Timor-Leste and Australia \r\nto be postponed. Those proceedings had been due to \r\nopen on Wednesday 17 September 2014 and to close on \r\nWednesday 24 September 2014.\r\nHaving recalled the principal decisions handed \r\ndown by the International Court of Justice in the course \r\nof the past year, I now come to the new cases submitted \r\nto it.\r\nIn addition to the proceedings between Timor-Leste \r\nand Australia commenced in December 2013, which I \r\n12/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nhave just discussed, the Court had, on September 2013, \r\nreceived an application from Nicaragua instituting \r\nproceedings against Colombia, in which it requested \r\nthe Court, first, to determine\r\n“the precise course of the maritime boundary \r\nbetween Nicaragua and Colombia in the areas of \r\nthe continental shelf which appertained to each \r\nof them beyond the boundaries determined by the \r\nCourt in its Judgment of 19 November 2012”;\r\nand, secondly, to state the\r\n“principles and rules of international law that \r\ndetermine the rights and duties of the two States \r\nin relation to the area of overlapping continental \r\nshelf claims and the use of its resources, pending \r\nthe delimitation of the maritime boundary between \r\nthem beyond 200 nautical miles from Nicaragua’s \r\ncoast”.\r\nIn November 2013 the Court was seized of further \r\nproceedings by Nicaragua against Colombia in a \r\ndispute concerning\r\n“violations of Nicaragua’s sovereign rights of \r\nmaritime zones declared by the Court’s Judgment \r\nof 19 November 2012 in the case concerning \r\nTerritorial and Maritime Dispute (Nicaragua v. \r\nColombia) and the threat of the use of force by \r\nColombia in order to implement those violations”.\r\nNext, on 25 February, the Court was seized of a \r\ndispute between Costa Rica and Nicaragua in the case \r\nconcerning Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea \r\nand the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua). It is \r\nmoreover noteworthy that it was the first time in the \r\nCourt’s history that it had been asked to carry out a \r\nmaritime delimitation between two States on either \r\nside of their respective mainland territories, in that \r\ndelimitation was being requested in both the Caribbean \r\nSea and the Pacific Ocean in that specific case.\r\nOn 24 April, the Marshall Islands filed nine \r\napplications with the Court Registry, in which it accused \r\nnine States of failing to perform their obligations with \r\nrespect to nuclear disarmament and the cessation of the \r\nnuclear arms race at an early date. The applications filed \r\nagainst India, Pakistan and the United Kingdom were \r\nentered on the Court’s General List, since those States \r\nhave accepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction \r\nunder Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute. However, \r\nin regard to the six other applications against China, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, France, \r\nIsrael, the Russian Federation and the United States of \r\nAmerica, that was not possible. In respect of each of \r\nthose applications, the Republic of the Marshall Islands \r\nstated that it sought, in accordance with article 38, \r\nparagraph 5 of the Rules of Court to base the Court’s \r\njurisdiction on the consent of the State concerned under \r\nthe doctrine of forum prorogatum. Without that consent, \r\nnone of the applications could be entered on the forms \r\nof the Court’s list.\r\nFinally, on 28 August, the Federal Republic of \r\nSomalia instituted proceedings against the Republic \r\nof Kenya with regard to a dispute concerning Maritime \r\nDelimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia v. Kenya). \r\nSpecifically, Somalia claims that the two States disagree \r\non the course of their common maritime boundary and \r\nrequests the Court\r\n“to determine, on the basis of international law, the \r\ncomplete course of the single maritime boundary \r\ndividing all the maritime areas appertaining to \r\nSomalia and to Kenya in the Indian Ocean, including \r\nin the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles”.\r\nIt should be noted that both States have filed a declaration \r\naccepting the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction under \r\narticle 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute.\r\nThat therefore brings to seven the number of new \r\ncases submitted during the period under review and to \r\n14 the total number of cases currently on the Court’s \r\ndocket. As I have just shown, the Court always strives \r\nto ensure that the disputes submitted to it are settled \r\npromptly, in order to reduce its judicial backlog or \r\neven eliminate it entirely. Hearings have been held and \r\ndeliberations are under way in every case on the Court’s \r\nGeneral List in which the written procedure has closed. \r\nThe Court is thus committed to fulfilling its high \r\njudicial mission impartially and effectively, relying on \r\nthe cooperation of the parties to the disputes brought \r\nbefore it so as to resolve them in a timely manner. \r\nBy way of example, I need only remind the Assembly \r\nthat the Court made all the necessary preparations for \r\npublic hearings to be held in September 2014 in the \r\ncase concerning Questions relating to the Seizure and \r\nDetention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste \r\nv. Australia). It was only after receiving a joint request \r\nfrom the parties to postpone the hearings that it decided \r\nto adjourn the proceedings.\r\nThe Court has also continued its extrajudicial \r\nactivities this past year, notably the organization of \r\na conference to celebrate the centenary of the Peace \r\n14-59630 13/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nPalace, held on 23 September 2013. That conference, \r\nwhich centred on the theme of “The International \r\nCourt of Justice in the Service of Peace and Justice”, \r\ngave the Court the opportunity to welcome prominent \r\nfigures and to present speakers of the highest quality \r\nat the conference’s round tables. It was a very full but \r\nwell-balanced programme, encouraging speakers and \r\naudience alike not only to focus on the past and present \r\nof international justice, but also to reflect on the future \r\nand the challenges that lie ahead, particularly for the \r\nCourt. I am delighted to inform the Assembly that \r\nin July a collective work entitled Enhancing the Rule \r\nof Law through the International Court of Justice, an \r\noutcome of the conference held to mark the centenary \r\nof the Peace Palace, was published.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall that the Court \r\nmust do its utmost to serve the noble purposes and goals \r\nof the United Nations with modest resources, bearing in \r\nmind that Member States award it less than 1 per cent of \r\nthe Organization’s regular budget. Nevertheless, I hope \r\nthat I have shown that the recent contributions of the \r\nCourt are not to be measured in terms of its financial \r\nresources, but against the great progress it has made \r\nin the advancement of international justice and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States.\r\nI would like, however, to draw attention to the \r\nimportance of the role of Member States in the \r\ncomposition of the Court. A great responsibility is \r\nplaced on Member States, for it is they who are called \r\nupon to choose and elect the members of the Court \r\nwho will be tasked with carrying out a high and noble \r\njudicial mission. Therefore the quality of the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations is dependent in \r\nlarge measure on the contribution of Member States in \r\nthat respect. \r\nIn a similar vein, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to remind the Assembly that, despite \r\nvarious appeals and the adoption of texts by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the number of States having made a \r\ndeclaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court as \r\ncompulsory under article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute \r\nhas remained at 70 during the period under review.\r\nIt is to be hoped that the statements issued by certain \r\nStates expressing a desire to recognize the jurisdiction \r\nof the principal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nand the documents adopted to that end will give rise \r\nto wider recognition of the Court’s jurisdiction within \r\nthe international community in the form of declarations \r\nunder article 36, paragraph 2. 1 believe that, as a forum \r\nof distinguished diplomats working specifically within \r\nthe community of nations, the General Assembly is in \r\na privileged position to promote that ideal among the \r\nGovernments represented in the Assembly. I therefore \r\nreiterate my invitation to seek to encourage recourse \r\nto the Court for the settlement of disputes, as well as \r\nincreased recognition of its compulsory jurisdiction as a \r\nmeans of achieving peaceful resolutions to international \r\nconflicts and more harmonious inter-State relations.\r\nI would like to thank the delegations of Botswana, \r\nJapan, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the \r\nUnited Kingdom and Uruguay for having taken the \r\ninitiative to prepare a manual for the acceptance of \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court, which will be published \r\nin five languages. I welcome the publication of the \r\nmanual, which will be very useful.\r\nI would like to thank the General Assembly for \r\nthis opportunity to address it today and I wish every \r\nsuccess for its sixty-ninth session.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM).\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to agenda item 70, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice”, and takes note of the \r\nreport on the activities of the Court from 1 August \r\n2013 to 31 July 2014 (A/69/4), as requested by the \r\ndecision of the Assembly last year. I would also like to \r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice \r\nfor his presentation of the report to the Assembly today.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms and \r\nunderscores its principled positions concerning the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use or \r\nthreat of use of force. The International Court of Justice \r\nplays a significant role in promoting and encouraging \r\nthe settlement of international disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans, as reflected in the United Nations Charter, and \r\nin such a manner that international peace and security, \r\nand justice, are not endangered.\r\nThe Movement endeavours to generate further \r\nprogress to achieve full respect for international \r\nlaw and, in this regard, commends the role of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in promoting the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes, in accordance with \r\nthe relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter \r\nand the Statute of the Court, in particular Articles 33 \r\nand 94 of the Charter.\r\n14/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nWith regard to advisory opinions of the Court, \r\nnoting the fact that the Security Council has not sought \r\nany advisory opinion from the Court since 1970, NAM \r\nurges the Security Council to make greater use of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, as a source of advisory \r\nopinions and interpretation of the relevant norms of \r\ninternational law, and on controversial issues. It further \r\nrequests the Council to use the Court as a source of \r\ninterpreting relevant international law and also urges \r\nthe Council to consider its decisions being reviewed \r\nby the Court, bearing in mind the need to ensure \r\ntheir adherence to the United Nations Charter and \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Movement also invites the General Assembly, \r\nother organs of the United Nations and the specialized \r\nagencies duly authorized to request advisory opinions \r\nof the International Court of Justice on legal questions \r\narising within the scope of their activities.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms the \r\nimportance of the unanimous advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice issued on 8 July 1996 on \r\nthe Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. On \r\nthis, the Court concluded that there exists an obligation \r\nto pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion \r\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all \r\naspects under strict and effective international control.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement continues to call \r\non Israel, the occupying Power, to fully respect the \r\n9 July 2004 advisory opinion of the Court entitled \r\nLegal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the \r\nOccupied Palestinian Territory, and calls upon all States \r\nto respect and ensure respect of the provisions therein \r\nfor the realization of the end of the Israeli occupation \r\nthat began in 1967 and the independence of the State of \r\nPalestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): My delegation has \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States.\r\nAt the outset, the African Group would like to thank \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nPeter Tomka, for his presentation and also for the report \r\n(A/69/4). The African Group continues to consider the \r\nInternational Court of Justice to be the pre-eminent \r\nmechanism for the peaceful settlement of disputes at \r\nthe international level. It should be kept in mind that \r\nthe Court, as a court of justice and, moreover, the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, occupies \r\na special position. Everything the world Court does is \r\naimed at promoting the rule of law. The world Court \r\nhands down judgments and gives advisory opinions in \r\naccordance with its Statute, which is an integral part of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and thus contributes \r\nto promoting and clarifying international law.\r\nThe African Group welcomes the reaffirmed \r\nconfidence that States have shown in the Court’s ability \r\nto resolve their disputes. In particular, we are pleased to \r\nsee that States continue to refer disputes to the Court. \r\nThe number of cases currently pending on its docket \r\nis a reflection of the esteem in which States hold the \r\nCourt.\r\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of mechanisms \r\nfor the international judicial settlement of disputes \r\non a specialized or regional basis, the International \r\nCourt of Justice continues to attract a wide range of \r\ncases, covering many areas. The list of cases before the \r\nCourt includes cases pertaining to the demarcation of \r\nboundaries, such as Peru v Chile.\r\nThe African Group appreciates the fact that the \r\nCourt set itself a particularly demanding schedule of \r\nhearings and deliberations in order that it might consider \r\nseveral cases at the same time and deal as promptly \r\nas possible with incidental proceedings, which are \r\ntending to grow in number, including requests for the \r\nindication of preliminary and provisional measures. In \r\nthis connection, on 3 March 2014 the Court issued its \r\norder on the request for the indication of provisional \r\nmeasures submitted by Timor-Leste in December 2013 \r\nin the case concerning Questions relating to the Seizure \r\nand Detention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-\r\nLeste v Australia). The Court found that it had prima \r\nfacie jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the case in the \r\nlight of the declarations made by both parties in terms \r\nof Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Statute of the Court. \r\nThe Court also found that there was a link between \r\nthe rights claimed and the provisional measures that \r\nwere requested by Timor-Leste. Such measures were \r\naimed at preventing Australia’s further access to seized \r\nmaterial. The Court concluded that the conditions \r\nrequired by the Statute had been met for it to indicate \r\nprovisional measures because there was still a risk of \r\nirreparable prejudice.\r\nThe African Group is of the view that the Australia \r\nv Japan case contributes to the body of law governing \r\nthe environment, particularly with respect to the law \r\nof the sea. Australia commenced the proceedings on \r\n31 May 2010. On 31 March 2014, the International \r\n14-59630 15/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nCourt of Justice delivered its judgment, and, as far as \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction was concerned, the Court found \r\nthat since there was no maritime delimitation dispute \r\nbetween the parties in the Antarctic Ocean and since \r\nthe current dispute was only about the compatibility \r\nor not of Japan’s whaling activities with its obligations \r\nunder the Convention, Japan’s objection to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction could not be upheld.\r\nThe Court further found that the Japanese Whale \r\nResearch Program under Special Permit in the Antarctic \r\ninvolved activities that could broadly be characterized as \r\nscientific research, but that the evidence does not establish \r\nthat the programme’s design and implementation are \r\nreasonable in relation to achieving its stated objectives. \r\nThe Court therefore concluded that the special permits \r\ngranted by Japan for the killing, taking and treating of \r\nwhales in connection with the Japanese Whale Research \r\nProgram under Special Permit in the Antarctic were not \r\nfor purposes of scientific research pursuant to article \r\nVIII, paragraph 1, of the International Convention for \r\nthe Regulation of Whaling.\r\nAn interesting procedural development was that, by \r\nan order of 6 February 2013, the Court authorized New \r\nZealand to intervene in the Whaling in the Antarctic \r\n(Australia v. Japan) case. Therefore, on 20 November \r\n2012, New Zealand filed with the Registry a declaration \r\nof intervention in the case. In order to avail itself of \r\nthe right of intervention conferred by article 63 of \r\nthe Statute of the Court, New Zealand relied on its \r\nstatus as a party to the International Convention for \r\nthe Regulation of Whaling. It contended that as a \r\nparty to the Convention, it had a direct interest in the \r\nconstruction that might be placed upon the Convention \r\nby the Court in its decision in those proceedings. New \r\nZealand underlined in its declaration that it did not seek \r\nto be a party to the proceedings and confirmed that \r\nby availing itself of its right to intervene, it accepted \r\nthat the construction given by the judgment in the case \r\nwould be equally binding upon it.\r\nThe importance of advisory opinions on legal \r\nquestions referred to the International Court of Justice \r\ncannot be overstated in the pursuit of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It is therefore rather disappointing \r\nthat during the period under review, no requests for \r\nadvisory opinions were made.\r\nMr. Norman (Canada): On behalf of Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand (CANZ), I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nJudge Tomka, for his report on the work of the Court \r\nover the past year. As countries that firmly believe in \r\nthe rule of law, the CANZ countries have always been \r\nstrong supporters of the International Court of Justice. \r\nWe have tremendous respect for the work of the Court \r\nand for the quality and dedication of its judges.\r\nOnce again, the Court has seen a sustained \r\ncaseload, demonstrating its vital position in the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes. The 13 cases currently \r\nbefore the Court come from around the world and \r\nrepresent a diversity of subject matter. CANZ welcomes \r\nthe willingness of States to turn to the Court for the \r\npeaceful settlement of their disputes.\r\nOur confidence in the Court is reflected in our \r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. \r\nCANZ believes that wider acceptance of the compulsory \r\njurisdiction would enable the Court to fulfil its role more \r\neffectively by reducing jurisdictional issues, thereby \r\nallowing the Court to focus more of its attention on the \r\nsubstance of disputes. In line with resolution 68/116, we \r\nencourage Member States that have not yet done so to \r\naccept the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nOn 6 November, the members of the General \r\nAssembly and Security Council will vote to fill five \r\nvacancies for the Court’s judges. Our three countries \r\nunreservedly endorse the candidature of Mr. James \r\nCrawford for one of the two vacancies in the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States. He is a distinguished \r\ninternational lawyer who would be a valuable addition \r\nto the Court. He was nominated 27 times in the national \r\ngroups’ lists of the Permanent Court of Arbitration, \r\nwhich is remarkable. It is also a telling indication of \r\nthe esteem in which he is held in the international legal \r\narena. We therefore encourage all Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to support Mr. Crawford.\r\nWe expect that the work programme of the Court \r\nin the year ahead will remain full, as States continue to \r\nreaffirm their confidence in the Court. For our part, our \r\ncountries hope that the International Court of Justice \r\nwill continue to play its important role in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes.\r\nMr. Zellweger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nOver the past 20 years, the work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice has increased considerably. A growing \r\nnumber of States recognize the practical and effective \r\nmeans that the Court offers for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. Indeed, because of its unique mandate, \r\n16/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nits universal character, the authority and finality of \r\nits decisions and the consensus-based nature of its \r\njurisdiction, the Court is the ideal framework for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States.\r\nIn order to strengthen that momentum and encourage \r\neven more States to recognize the Court’s jurisdiction, \r\non 24 September 2012, during the Assembly’s High-\r\nlevel Meeting on the Rule of Law at the National and \r\nInternational Levels (A/67/PVs.3-5.), Switzerland and \r\nthe Netherlands undertook to draw up, with the help \r\nof the Secretariat, a practical guide highlighting the \r\nCourt’s benefits and explaining the various options \r\navailable for recognizing its jurisdiction. The United \r\nKingdom, Uruguay, Lithuania, Japan and Botswana \r\nsubsequently joined that project. Since then, the \r\npractical guide has been completed and was sent this \r\nweek to all permanent missions in New York.\r\nStates have three options for recognizing the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction: first, unilaterally accepting \r\nits jurisdiction; secondly, accepting its jurisdiction \r\nby treaty; or thirdly, referring a specific dispute to \r\nthe Court by compromise. Those three options are \r\nexplained in detail in the brochure. Specific examples \r\nare given in the form of model declarations, articles and \r\ncompromise clauses that can be adopted and adapted by \r\nStates as they see fit. The guide is practical in nature. \r\nIt is mainly addressed to States for their diplomats or \r\nany member of a delegation negotiating international \r\ntreaties. We hope that it will help to remove certain \r\ntechnical obstacles to the recognition of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction. We hope that the guide will further \r\nenhance the Court’s importance and its contribution to \r\na more just and peaceful international order.\r\nMr. Pírez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nCuba welcomes the introduction of the valuable \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice (A/69/4). \r\nWe would also like to express to the Assembly \r\nour commitment to the strict implementation of \r\ninternational law and the peaceful resolution of \r\ninternational disputes.\r\nMy delegation recognizes the work performed by \r\nthe Court since its inception. Its decisions and advisory \r\nopinions have been of particular importance, not \r\nonly for the cases under consideration but also for the \r\ndevelopment of public international law. The volume of \r\ncases brought to the Court, many of which originated \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean region, demonstrates \r\nthe importance that the international community \r\nattaches to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The \r\nRepublic of Cuba advocates for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes in accordance with Article 33, paragraph \r\n1, of the United Nations Charter, and has declared its \r\nacceptance of and prior consent to the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.\r\nCuba regrets the existence of unexecuted judgments \r\nof the Court, in clear violation of Article 94 of the \r\nCharter, which requires each Member of the United \r\nNations to undertake to comply with the decision of \r\nthe International Court of Justice in any case in which \r\nit is a party. In that regard, the Republic of Cuba is \r\nconcerned that the effectiveness and enforceability of \r\nthe judgments of the Court can be reasonably open to \r\ncriticism when some countries do not even acknowledge \r\njudgments that are unfavourable to them. Unfortunately, \r\nthe refusal of those countries to comply with judgments \r\nand their obstruction of United Nations mechanisms \r\ndesigned to enforce judgments, such as through the \r\nuse of the privilege of the veto in the Security Council, \r\nshow how imperfect the mechanisms are for executing \r\nthe Court’s decisions.\r\nThe foregoing shows that the need to reform the \r\nUnited Nations system in order to give developing \r\ncountries greater assurance in confronting powerful \r\nnations also applies to the International Court of Justice. \r\nMy delegation considers it useful for the Court to \r\ndemonstrate a critical balance, in which its relationship \r\nto the bodies of the United Nations, particularly the \r\nSecurity Council, is taken into account.\r\nMany significant cases have been taken up by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Cuba attaches great \r\nimportance to the unanimous advisory opinion of \r\nthe Court issued on 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the \r\nThreat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. In that opinion, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice arrived at the conclusion \r\nthat there is an obligation to pursue in good faith and \r\nbring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear \r\ndisarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective \r\ninternational control. In that regard, as has already \r\nbeen stated in this Hall, Cuba urges that the advisory \r\nopinion of 9 July 2004, entitled Legal Consequences of \r\nthe Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian \r\nTerritory, be fully respected and calls upon all States to \r\nrespect and guarantee respect for the provisions of the \r\nCourt on that important matter.\r\n14-59630 17/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nCuba attaches great importance to the allocation \r\nof the necessary budgetary resources so that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice can properly perform \r\nits work of peacefully settling conflicts that fall under \r\nits jurisdiction. Cuba calls for working to make sure \r\nthat those resources reach the Court in a timely and \r\nappropriate manner.\r\nThe Republic of Cuba wishes to thank the Court \r\nfor publications made available to Governments and \r\nfor online resources. They are valuable material for \r\nthe study and dissemination of international law, in \r\nparticular for developing countries, some of which \r\noften see themselves deprived of information on the \r\nprogress of international law owing to outdated and \r\nabsurd embargo policies that have been overwhelmingly \r\nrejected by the international community.\r\nCuba is a country with peaceful aspirations. It \r\nrespects international law and has always faithfully \r\nfulfilled its international obligations under treaties to \r\nwhich it is a party. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto reiterate our commitment to peace. The events \r\nthat have taken place in recent years conclusively \r\ndemonstrate the importance of the International Court \r\nof Justice as an international jurisdictional body that \r\nsettles, in accordance with international law and \r\npeacefully and in good faith, disputes with the greatest \r\nimpact for the international community.\r\nMrs. Miculescu (Romania): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Tomka, for introducing the report on the \r\nwork of the Court (A/69/4), which has given us a useful \r\ninsight into the Court’s activity during the judicial year \r\n2013-2014.\r\nStates submitting their disputes to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction expect the main judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations to reach a decision after a very careful \r\nassessment of the relevant law and facts. Those \r\nexpectations were fully met in the case of the judgments \r\ndelivered by the Court during the period under review. \r\nWe can say that its activity has increased in scope and \r\ndegree of complexity, and we commend the Court for \r\nits tremendous work. The Court’s current docket bears \r\nwitness to the consolidated trust placed by States in the \r\nCourt.\r\nMy country is a strong supporter of the Court \r\nand is committed to the settlement of all disputes in \r\naccordance with international law. Romania has been \r\nsignificantly involved with the work of the Court in the \r\npast. A known example is the application submitted \r\nin connection with the delimitation of the maritime \r\nspaces between Romania and Ukraine in the Black Sea \r\nin the Maritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania \r\nv. Ukraine) case. On 3 February, an event marking \r\nthe five years since the delivery of the judgment in \r\nthat case was organized in Bucharest, which enjoyed \r\nthe presence of Judge Keith along with several other \r\nleading personalities in the field of international law.\r\nRomania intends to continue and strengthen its \r\nengagement with the Court. In that respect, I would \r\nlike to briefly present the endeavours undertaken so far \r\nas regards the possible acceptance by Romania of the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of \r\nJustice. In the report, as the Assembly knows, the Court \r\nnoted with appreciation that the General Assembly, in \r\nits resolution 68/116, called upon States that have not yet \r\nmade a declaration recognizing the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction to consider doing so. Romania is indeed \r\nconsidering joining the ranks of the countries that have \r\nalready made such a declaration. Romanian authorities \r\nhave taken several steps in that regard.\r\nAt the initiative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs \r\nof Romania, a public debate was launched last year on \r\nthe possibility of Romania’s accepting the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court. That public discussion \r\nshowed that there was general support for the initiative \r\namong the Romanian authorities, experts in the field of \r\ninternational law and the general public. Following the \r\nconclusion of the public debate, a draft law on filing \r\na declaration accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court was submitted to one of the chambers of our \r\nnational Parliament and is currently being examined \r\nby the other chamber, namely, the Senate. There is \r\ntherefore a good chance that, at the time of delivery \r\nof the next annual report of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Romania will already be among the States that \r\nhave accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, \r\nwhich is naturally further proof of our strong support \r\nfor the Court.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Romania’s \r\nfirm belief that strict compliance with the norms \r\nof international law is a prerequisite for the proper \r\nfunctioning of international society. That vision is best \r\nreflected in the words of former Foreign Minister of \r\nRomania and former President of the League of Nations, \r\nNicolae Titulescu. Inscribed beneath his effigy at the \r\nPeace Palace in The Hague are his words: “It is in the \r\n18/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\npeace created by legal order that man can fulfil his \r\ndestiny”.\r\nMr. Saeed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nSudan joins its voice to the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement, and of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice contained in document \r\nA/69/4. We would also like to thank the President of the \r\nCourt, Judge Peter Tomka, for his presentation of the \r\nreport, which reflects the activities and deliberations \r\nundertaken by the Court in the judicial year 2013-2014. \r\nMy delegation expresses its appreciation for the \r\nrole played by the Court as part of its duties under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, to strengthen the \r\nrule of law internationally through its judgments and \r\nlegal opinions, which also make a vital contribution \r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe role of the International Court of Justice and its \r\nnumerous activities require that Member States provide \r\nmore political support and ensure that sufficient funds \r\nare provided to enable the Court to undertake the \r\nduties assigned to it. The discussion of the annual \r\nreport provides a good opportunity for the General \r\nAssembly to reiterate the importance of the role of the \r\nCourt and to extend its support. The large number of \r\ncases referred to the Court by States shows that there \r\nis growing confidence in the Court and in its ability to \r\nresolve disputes with independence and integrity and \r\nin a way that is acceptable to all of the parties to the \r\ndisputes.\r\nThe Sudan encourages the Court to pursue measures \r\nto strengthen its capacities and its effectiveness to deal \r\nwith the great and increasing number of cases and \r\nresponsibilities, in particular to conclude proceedings \r\nquickly. My delegation also encourages Member States \r\nthat have not yet recognized the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt to consider doing so and take steps to contribute \r\nto strengthening the rule of law internationally and \r\nenable the Court to undertake its duties in accordance \r\nwith the Charter.\r\nThe Security Council has not requested any \r\nadvisory opinions from the Court since 1970. The \r\nSudan urges the Council to take advantage of the Court \r\n- as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nand as a source of advisory opinions regarding the \r\ninterpretation of the principles of international law - \r\nby tapping into the Court’s programmes and activities. \r\nWe also urge the General Assembly and specialized \r\nagencies to request advisory opinions from the Court, \r\nespecially regarding the interpretation of international \r\nlaw on their programmes and activities. \r\nIn conclusion, the Sudan reiterates the importance \r\nof the Court. We support its role so it can exercise its \r\nresponsibilities as required.\r\nMr. De Vega (Philippines): At the outset, we thank \r\nPresident Peter Tomka and his team at The Hague \r\nfor their comprehensive report on the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/69/4) in the past year.\r\nThe Philippines associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nSince its creation, 68 years ago, the Court has \r\ncontinued to play a vital role in international relations. \r\nAs the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, \r\nthe Court resolves disputes that cannot otherwise be \r\nresolved by, or through, the political organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. Under Article 38 of the Statute of the \r\nCourt, those are disputes that are capable of settlement \r\nthrough the application of the sources of international \r\nlaw - treaties, international custom, general principles \r\nof law - and, as subsidiary sources, judicial decisions \r\nand the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists.\r\nTwo years ago, the United Nations held its first-\r\never High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law. It resulted \r\nin a consensus Declaration of the High-level Meeting \r\nof the General Assembly on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels (resolution 67/1). \r\nThat document recognizes that the international \r\ncommunity has the institutions, working methods and \r\nrelationships to make the rule of law relevant to peace \r\nand security, human rights and development. One of \r\nthose institutions is none other than the International \r\nCourt of Justice. Paragraph 31 of the Declaration \r\nrecognizes the invaluable contribution of the Court in \r\npromoting the rule of law. The Philippines reaffirms its \r\nsupport for the Declaration, and we affirm our duty to \r\ncomply with the decisions of the Court in contentious \r\ncases. \r\nArticle 1, paragraph 1, of chapter I of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations reminds us of our peremptory duty,\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\n14-59630 19/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace.”\r\nThat is the very rationale for the 1982 Manila \r\nDeclaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International \r\nDisputes (resolution 37/10), whose thirtieth anniversary \r\nwe commemorated two years ago. The Manila \r\nDeclaration was negotiated and adopted by the General \r\nAssembly during the Cold War, when non-aligned \r\ncountries were seeking to consolidate their political \r\nand economic independence. The Manila Declaration \r\nsupported their aspirations by articulating the norms \r\nof the peaceful settlement of disputes as outlined in \r\nChapter VI of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFrom the Corfu Channel case in 1947 to the \r\nadoption of the Manila Declaration in 1982, a span of \r\n35 years, the Court disposed of 49 contentious cases. \r\nSince 1982, however, the caseload of the Court has \r\nincreased, as it disposed of more than 80 contentious \r\ncases in a comparably shorter period of 32 years. In the \r\nperiod under review, the Court was seized of seven new \r\ncontentious cases, bringing its docket to 13 cases — or \r\nactually now 14, as we have just learned from President \r\nTomka. \r\nThe sovereign parties to those cases come from \r\nall over the world, half of them from Latin America. \r\nYesterday, at an event co-organized by Mexico and the \r\nAmerican Society of International Law, we learned \r\nof ideas as to why Latin American countries repose \r\ngreat trust in international adjudication, including by \r\nthe Court. We thereby learned how Latin America as a \r\ngroup has contributed to the progressive development \r\nof international law. It is an example that we believe the \r\nrest of the world should follow.\r\nThat ever-increasing confidence, especially among \r\ndeveloping countries, in the capabilities, credibility and \r\nimpartiality of the Court to settle disputes exclusively \r\nby peaceful means is not unrelated to the norms, values \r\nand aspirations articulated in the Manila Declaration. \r\nThe most fundamental of those is the non-use or threat \r\nof use of force. After all, the Manila Declaration reflects \r\nthe international community’s increasing reliance on \r\nthe rule of law as a cornerstone not only of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, but also of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Only respect for the \r\nrule of law at the international level can guarantee the \r\norder and stability that we desire and deserve. That is \r\nhow we contribute to the progressive development of \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe mandate and the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nhave become sharper over the years. The creation of \r\nthe International Criminal Court and specialized \r\ndispute settlement mechanisms like the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Appellate Body \r\nof the World Trade Organization does not make the \r\nCourt any less important in the twenty-first century. \r\nOn the contrary, the contemporary international legal \r\narchitecture only strengthens the Court as the only \r\nforum for resolving justiciable disputes between States \r\nconcerning the vast field of general international law. \r\nAs a matter of fact, the Court is still seized of disputes \r\nconcerning genocide, territorial and maritime issues, \r\nenvironmental damage and the conservation of living \r\nresources.\r\nIf there is anything that the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the Statute, jurisprudence and experience \r\nof the International Court of Justice all teach us, it is \r\nthat smaller nations, if their cause is just, should have \r\nno fear of the big Powers. It is that, through the work of \r\nthe Court, the rule of law in international relations has \r\na chance to prevail. The Philippines therefore renews \r\nthe call for Member States that have not yet done so to \r\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nFinally, we also call on the Security Council to \r\nseriously consider Article 96 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and make greater use of the Court as \r\na source of advisory opinions and of interpretation of \r\nthe relevant norms of international law, particularly \r\non the most current and controversial issues affecting \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Diener Sala (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Mexico wishes to express its deep \r\ngratitude to the International Court of Justice for the \r\narduous work it has carried out this year, as well as \r\nto thank its President, Judge Tomka, for presenting the \r\nCourt’s report (A/69/4).\r\nThe important and intensive work carried out \r\nby the Court over the past year demonstrates the \r\ninternational community’s confidence in it as the \r\nprincipal international judicial organ. The Court’s \r\nstrength is seen in its universal calling - the parties to \r\ndisputes represent all regional groups and continents - \r\nin States’ use of the various procedural means set out \r\nin the Statute, and in the diversity of the substantive \r\nmatters at issue in the disputes.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation would like to point \r\nout that of the 17 cases on the list of cases heard by \r\n20/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nthe Court during the period covered in the report, 8 \r\ninvolved States from Latin America and the Caribbean. \r\nOne of them was resolved by the Court and another was \r\nwithdrawn by the States that brought the proceedings. \r\nThat is a testament to the commitment our region has \r\ntowards compliance with international law and the \r\nprinciple that the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes is absolute.\r\nMy delegation would like to emphasize the \r\ngreat legal value of the Court’s rulings, both for \r\nStates parties to the action and for the international \r\ncommunity as a whole, given that its jurisprudence \r\nserves as an auxiliary source of primary importance \r\nfor determining the validity and content of norms. The \r\nCourt has an essential role to play in the development of \r\ninternational law, particularly in leading the dialogue \r\nwith other legal bodies, which enriches international \r\nlaw and helps prevent its fragmentation.\r\nFrom an objective perspective, the Court’s work has \r\nbecome more complex, since States repeatedly resort to \r\nall the other procedural alternatives available under the \r\nStatute, such as requests for provisional measures and \r\ninterpretation of judgments. The Court’s determination \r\non those requests are critical to preventing the \r\nescalation or emergence of new disputes. That was \r\nmade clear in the cases Certain Activities carried out by \r\nNicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) \r\nand Questions relating to the Seizure and Detention of \r\nCertain Documents and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia), \r\nas well as the interpretation that the Court provided of \r\nthe its Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case  concerning \r\nthe Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand).\r\nAlso, from a substantive point of view, the Court, \r\nin its two judgments handed down during the period \r\ncovered by the report, addressed important issues such \r\nas compliance with treaty obligations with respect to \r\nthe conservation of living resources, in particular in the \r\nlight of the principle good faith, as we saw in the case \r\nWhaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan). We also \r\nsaw that in the Court’s settlement of the case Maritime \r\nDispute (Peru v. Chile), which complements the \r\nextensive jurisprudence it has generated on the issue.\r\nMexico wishes to express its gratitude to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for its willingness to authorize new \r\nposts and other budgetary requests made by the Court. \r\nWe call on the Assembly to continue providing the \r\nCourt with the tools it needs to properly carry out its \r\nduties as the Organization’s principal judicial organ. It \r\nmust also provide the Court with the resources required \r\nfor the celebration of its seventieth anniversary in 2016.\r\nMexico would also like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to the Registrar of the Court, Mr Philippe \r\nCouvreur, for his high-quality performance in the \r\nthree dimensions of his role - legal, diplomatic and \r\nadministrative. We also express our appreciation to the \r\nCarnegie Endowment for housing the Court in the Peace \r\nPalace in The Hague. Likewise, Mexico recognizes the \r\nwork carried out by Mexican judges throughout the \r\nCourt’s history.\r\nI wish to conclude my remarks by calling on those \r\nStates that have not done so to accept the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court, in accordance with Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute, thereby strengthening the \r\nrule of law at the international level to ensure that all \r\nStates have access to a robust judicial mechanism for \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nMr. Plasai (Thailand): It is my honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Kingdom of Thailand on \r\nthis agenda item. At the outset, I would like to thank \r\nPresident Tomka for his able presidency and for his \r\nthorough report on the activities of the International \r\nCourt of Justice during the past year.\r\nThe Court has played an active role in addressing \r\ndisputes between States on diverse issues. For this \r\nreporting period, the issues ranged from judgment \r\ninterpretation to maritime delimitation, from the \r\npreservation of wildlife to the integrity of the \r\nenvironment. With such a diversity of cases, the report \r\nreflects the remarkable efforts made by the Court in \r\nmanaging its docket efficiently and expeditiously.\r\nThis year’s report includes a case to which Thailand \r\nwas a party, namely the case concerning the Request \r\nfor Interpretation of the Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the \r\ncase concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia \r\nv. Thailand) (Cambodia v. Thailand) - “Phra Viharn” in \r\nthe Thai language. The case represents what is probably \r\nthe first time that the judges on the bench interpreted a \r\njudgment in which none of them had taken part in the \r\noriginal proceedings. \r\nYet a reading of the interpretive Judgment of \r\n11 November 2013 shows that the Court took the time \r\nand made the effort to carefully and thoroughly review \r\nthe records of the original proceedings. Indeed, the \r\nCourt underlines, in paragraph 69 of the Judgment, that \r\nthe pleadings and the record of the oral proceedings in \r\n14-59630 21/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\n1962 are “relevant to the interpretation of the Judgment, \r\nas they show what evidence was, or was not, before the \r\nCourt and how the issues before it were formulated by \r\neach Party”.\r\nOverall, I am pleased to say that the Judgment of \r\n11 November 2013 is considered to be based on well-\r\ngrounded reasoning and consistent with the Court’s \r\npast jurisprudence. It also gives importance to the need \r\nfor both countries to hold talks. The Judgment helps \r\nclarify several points of law that are crucial and thus \r\nwill constitute a clearer and useful basis for future \r\nconsultation or negotiation between the two parties, \r\nboth for the matter decided by the Court in 1962 - that \r\nis, as the Court puts it, sovereignty over a defined \r\narea of territory - and beyond. The Judgment has also \r\ncontributed in a positive manner to various aspects of \r\nthe existing jurisprudence on judgment interpretation, \r\nsome of which I would like to mention for the record.\r\nFirst, in interpreting the 1962 Judgment, the Court \r\nreaffirmed that the principle of non ultra petita must \r\nbe respected in the context of judgment interpretation. \r\nIn other words, the Court reaffirmed that questions \r\nthat were not properly submitted by the applicant \r\nto the Court, and therefore not decided by the Court \r\nin the original proceedings, cannot be subject to \r\ninterpretation.\r\nSecondly, the Court also reaffirmed that the \r\nprinciple of res judicata must be respected in an \r\ninterpretation proceeding, namely, points not decided \r\nwith binding force in the original proceedings cannot \r\nbe the subject of interpretation. Accordingly, the \r\nCourt has kept strictly within the limits of the original \r\nJudgment and refrained from tackling questions that it \r\ndid not decide in 1962.\r\nThirdly, the Court considers that the scope of the \r\nres judicata of the 1962 Judgment corresponds to that of \r\nthe subject matter of the original proceedings - namely \r\nand exclusively, sovereignty over the Temple of Preah \r\nVihear and the promontory on which it stands - and to \r\nno other issue.\r\nThe Temple interpretation case remains an important \r\nissue in Thailand. The level of public awareness of \r\nthe case and the high demand for information and \r\nexplanation have been unprecedented. During the oral \r\nproceedings and the reading of the Judgment last year, \r\nthe Thai public followed the Court’s proceedings with \r\nhuge interest and in real time through live television \r\nbroadcast nationwide from The Hague to Thailand, \r\nwith simultaneous interpretation into Thai. Almost \r\nnever in Thai history has an official international event \r\ngenerated such public interest. In the process, needless \r\nto say, the role of the International Court of Justice \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nhas been underlined and has become better known \r\nand understood in my country. It is our hope that the \r\nJudgment will contribute to good neighbourliness \r\nbetween Thailand and Cambodia, two countries that \r\nshare a common destiny as brothers in the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing my \r\nappreciation to the judges and the Registry of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for their efficiency \r\nand professionalism, as well as their contribution \r\nto international justice. It has been an honour and a \r\nprivilege for me to serve as the agent of the Kingdom of \r\nThailand in this case.\r\nMr. Alabrune (France) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to thank the President of the International Court \r\nof Justice for his very informative presentation of the \r\nreport on the Court’s activity for the past year (A/69/4).\r\nAs the list of cases on its docket serves to highlight, \r\nthe Court’s litigation activity has increased remarkably \r\nover the past 20 years, testifying as much to States’ \r\nconfidence in its jurisdiction as to the role played by \r\nthe Court, as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, in the quest to settle disputes peacefully and \r\nstrengthen the rule of law.\r\nIn that regard, if the Court’s judgments and \r\ndecisions are accepted by the parties because of the \r\nauthority of the res judicata attached to them, States’ \r\nrespect for and willingness to comply with them are \r\nalso a function of the quality of the Court’s decisions. \r\nThe Court’s judgments and decisions can thus help ease \r\npolitical tensions and enable States to find solutions \r\nthat other peaceful ways of resolving disputes do not \r\noffer. The Court’s Judgment of 11 November 2013 in \r\nthe case concerning the Request for Interpretation of \r\nthe Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning \r\nthe Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand) is an illustration of that. \r\nThe decision should help calm the territorial dispute \r\nbetween Cambodia and Thailand and enable them to \r\nfind a solution to the issue of delimiting their common \r\nborder in that area.\r\nBorder disputes are an important part of the business \r\nof the Court, and over the past decade, maritime disputes \r\n22/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nhave become increasingly important in that category. \r\nOne example is the case Maritime Dispute (Peru v. \r\nChile), on which the Court delivered its Judgment on \r\n27 January 2014. Other cases, still pending, include \r\nthat of Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and \r\nthe Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), Alleged \r\nViolations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in \r\nthe Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Question \r\nof the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between \r\nNicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 nautical miles \r\nfrom the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia) \r\nand the case recently instituted by Somalia against \r\nKenya on Maritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean \r\n(Somalia v. Kenya), which concernins the two States’ \r\ncommon maritime boundary.\r\nIn addition, this year has once again enabled us to \r\nappreciate the diversity of areas that the Court ends \r\nup dealing with. Among the disputes on the Court’s \r\ndocket, four touch on aspects of the obligation to \r\nnegotiate - the three applications of the Marshall Islands \r\nfor proceedings having to do with negotiations to end \r\nthe nuclear arms race and nuclear disarmament, and \r\nBolivia’s case against Chile in Obligation to Negotiate \r\nAccess to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile). The \r\nobligation to negotiate is thus presented as one of the \r\ncornerstones of public international law, cutting across \r\nthe various branches of the law.\r\nThis year also featured a number of applications \r\ninstituting proceedings based on article 38, paragraph \r\n5 of the Rules of Court. This year, in keeping with a \r\nbasic trend, States again made particularly full use of \r\nincidental proceedings, with the Court handing down 13 \r\norders, as compared with three judgments. While that \r\nhas enabled the Court to clarify the terms of its judicial \r\nfunction, it has also helped to lengthen proceedings and \r\nincrease the Court’s workload.\r\nOverall, the special appeal of the International \r\nCourt of Justice is testament to the quality of the \r\nmotives supporting its judgments and the well-balanced \r\nsolutions that result.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to once more \r\nexpress to the Court, on behalf of France, our gratitude \r\nfor its work, which this year, as in the past, continues to \r\nreflect its sustained and effective action.\r\nMs. Chadha (India): I would like to join other \r\ndelegations in thanking Judge Tomka, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for presenting us with the \r\nCourt’s comprehensive report on the judicial activities \r\nof the Court over the past year (A/69/4).\r\nThe Court, being the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, is entrusted with the task of peacefully \r\nresolving disputes between States, which is important \r\nto the fulfilment of one of the core purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations: the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Since its establishment, the Court has \r\naccomplished that task admirably and has acquired a \r\nwell-deserved reputation as an impartial institution \r\nmaintaining the highest legal standards in accordance \r\nwith its mandate under the Charter of the United \r\nNations, of which the Statute of the Court is an integral \r\npart.\r\nAs the Preamble to the Charter states, one of the \r\nprimary goals of the United Nations is to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for \r\ninternational obligations can be maintained. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as the only Court with \r\njurisdiction in general international law, is uniquely \r\nplaced to play that role. \r\nThe report of the Court illustrates the importance \r\nthat States attach to the Courtand the confidence they \r\nrepose in it, as is clearly evidenced by the number, \r\nnature and variety of cases that the Court deals with \r\nand by the ability of the Court to deal with complex \r\naspects of public international law.\r\nThe cases before the Court involve a wide variety \r\nof subject matter, such as territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes, environmental damage and the conservation \r\nof living resources, violations of territorial integrity, \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights, genocide, the interpretation and application \r\nof international conventions and treaties, and the \r\ninterpretation of the Court’s judgments.\r\nThe judgments delivered by the Court have \r\nplayed an important role in the interpretation and \r\nclarification of the rules of international law, as well \r\nas in the progressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. In the performance of its judicial \r\nfunctions, the Court has remained sensitive to political \r\nrealities and the sentiments of States while acting \r\nstrictly in accordance with the provisions of the United \r\nNations Charter, its own Statute and other applicable \r\nrules of international law.\r\nThe acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court is a means to secure and promote the \r\n14-59630 23/24\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.33\r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Its foundation lies in \r\nthe confidence expressed by States in the rule of law at \r\nthe international level. States that have reposed faith in \r\nthe system under Article 36, paragraph 2 of the Statute \r\nhave done so for legal disputes that may arise between \r\nthe parties inter se. This is confirmed by Article 59 of \r\nthe Statute, which clearly provides that the decision \r\nof the Court has no binding force except between the \r\nparties and in respect of that particular case. Therefore, \r\nthe filing of cases that seek universal objectives in \r\ncomplete disregard of this basic premise raises very \r\nserious issues for countries such as India that have \r\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nAs regards the Court’s docket, we note that during \r\nthe 2013-2014 judicial year, the Court delivered three \r\njudgments, held public hearings in four cases and \r\nhanded down 13 orders. During this period, the Court \r\nwas seized of seven new contentious cases. The total \r\nnumber of contentious cases currently before the Court, \r\nas clarified by President Tomka, now stands at 14.\r\nThe Court’s second function - that of providing \r\nadvisory opinion on legal questions referred to it by \r\norgans of the United Nations and specialized agencies - \r\nadds to its important role of clarifying key international \r\nlegal issues. The report of the Court rightly points out in \r\nparagraph 17 that “everything the Court does is aimed \r\nat promoting the rule of law”, in particular through its \r\njudgments and the advisory opinions.\r\nWe appreciate the Court’s efforts to ensure the \r\ngreatest possible global awareness of its decisions \r\nthrough its publications, multimedia offerings and \r\nthrough its website, which now features the Court’s \r\nentire jurisprudence as well as that of its predecessor, \r\nthe Permanent Court of International Justice.\r\nWe are glad to note that the Court is planning to \r\ncelebrate its seventieth anniversary in April 2016 and is \r\norganizing a number of events on that occasion.\r\nFinally, India wishes to reaffirm its support for \r\nthe Court and acknowledges the importance that the \r\ninternational community attaches to the work of the \r\nCourt in the advancement of international justice.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru \r\nwelcomes the annual report of the International Court \r\nof Justice to the General Assembly for the period from \r\n1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 (A/69/4).\r\nMy delegation wishes to begin by underscoring the \r\ncrucial role played by the International Court of Justice \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nsystem for the peaceful settlement of disputes under the \r\nCharter. Its contribution to the promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw has been vital.\r\nPeru wishes also to recall that in addition to the \r\nvaluable work done by the Court in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of inter-State disputes, the Court may, \r\npursuant to Article 96 of the Charter, issue advisory \r\nopinions at the request of the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and other authorized bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations, and specialized agencies. There are \r\ntwo areas of jurisdiction of the Court, jurisdiction in \r\ncontentious proceedings and advisory jurisdiction, and \r\nthe Court’s judgments and opinions help to promote \r\nand clarify international law as a genuine path to peace.\r\nPeru is therefore pleased that the General Assembly \r\nhas urged States that have not yet done so to consider \r\nrecognizing the jurisdiction of the Court, pursuant to \r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2 of its Statute.\r\nPeru also wishes to acknowledge the work carried \r\nout by the eminent judges of the Court, in particular the \r\nPresident and Vice-President, as well as the judges ad \r\nhoc. Peru welcomes the forthcoming triennial renewal \r\nof the composition of the Court through elections \r\nslated for 6 November. Likewise, we are grateful for \r\nthe intensive work done by the Registry of the Court, in \r\nparticular its Registrar and Deputy Registrar.\r\nThe sustained high volume of work at the \r\nInternational Court of Justice is testimony to the \r\nprestige it enjoys as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. That is explained by, inter alia, the \r\nmany measures taken in recent years to enhance its \r\nefficiency and enable it to cope with a constant increase \r\nin its workload, and to more promptly deal with the \r\ngrowing number of incidental proceedings, as set out in \r\nparagraphs 9 and 10 of the report.\r\nLikewise, Peru is pleased to note that for the \r\nbiennium 2014-2015, most of the Court’s requests \r\nfor new posts and additional spending were granted. \r\nMy delegation expects to see the same spirit reign in \r\nthe biennium 2016-2017, when we will celebrate the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Court.\r\nFinally, as stated by the President of the Republic \r\nof Peru, Ollanta Humala Tasso, at the opening of \r\nthis session of the General Assembly, my delegation \r\nwishes to highlight the settlement of the maritime \r\nborder dispute with Chile through the judgment of the \r\nCourt handed down on 27 January 2014; we heard the \r\n24/24 14-59630\r\nA/69/PV.33 30/10/2014\r\nPresident of the Court touch on this in his briefing. We \r\nnote also that the enforcement of the judgment was the \r\nquickest in the history of the Court, as both parties \r\nhad jointly pinpointed the geographic coordinates of \r\nthe maritime border, in accordance with the judgment, \r\nwithin two months of the ruling. It is for that reason \r\nthat the President of Peru said: “In general, the way in \r\nwhich the entire case was conducted makes Peru and \r\nChile an example for the world.” (A/69/PV.9, p. 28).\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank Peter Tomka, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his leadership and for his \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Court.\r\nAs Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan emphasized \r\nfrom this rostrum two years in a row, the rule of law is \r\none of the most important aspects of Japan’s foreign \r\npolicy. Japan attaches particular importance to the \r\nactivities of the Court, the principal judicial organ \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. I appreciate \r\nthe role it has played to enhance the rule of law in the \r\ninternational community.\r\nInternational law provides the parties concerned \r\nwith a common language. We hear mounting \r\nexpectations across the globe for international law to \r\nserve as a device to disentangle the tensions of heated \r\ncontroversies. Cases referred to the Court involve a \r\nwide variety of subject matters, including territorial \r\nand maritime disputes, economic and environmental \r\ndisputes and violations related to international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law. Despite the fact \r\nthat the Court has been dealing with more complex \r\ncases in factual and legal terms, I appreciate that the \r\nCourt maintains its high-quality work.\r\nJapan strongly believes that more and more \r\ncountries concerned should recognize the importance of \r\ninternational law and make good use of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. For example, universal acceptance of \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction in accordance with Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Court’s Statute would enhance the \r\nfunction of the Court. Already in 1958 Japan unilaterally \r\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. The \r\nsituation concerning the acceptance of the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court is, however, very poor. Only 70 out of the \r\nentire membership of the United Nations have accepted \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice. Looking at the Asia-Pacific Group, which \r\nJapan belongs to, only 7 out of 54 countries have \r\naccepted it. I hope to see more countries, in particular \r\nmembers of the Asia-Pacific Group, do so.\r\nIn that context, Japan highly values the recent \r\npublication of the Handbook on Accepting the \r\nJurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, a copy \r\nof which I have with me. Let me express my special \r\ngratitude to Switzerland for its leadership in compiling \r\nthe handbook. My appreciation also goes to the other \r\nsponsors, namely the Netherlands, Uruguay, the United \r\nKingdom, Lithuania and Botswana. Japan is proud to \r\nbe among the seven producers.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to refer \r\nto Japan’s experience in the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes at the International Court of Justice. It was \r\nan important year for Japan, as the Court delivered its \r\njudgment in the case Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia \r\nv. Japan). Throughout the proceedings before the Court, \r\nJapan made clear its position on the issues involved \r\nin the case in full respect of the procedures. The \r\ndecision that Japan’s whaling research programme did \r\nnot fall within the relevant article of the International \r\nConvention for the Regulation of Whaling was \r\ndisappointing. However, Japan abides by the Judgment \r\nof the Court. Japan will continue to pursue its policy \r\non the sustainable use of marine living resources in \r\naccordance with international law and based upon \r\nscientific evidence, taking into account the reasoning \r\nand conclusions contained in the Judgment.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate Japan’s unwavering \r\nsupport for the International Court of Justice.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
