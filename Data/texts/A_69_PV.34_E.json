"*1459737*\r\n14-59737 (E)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Boureima \r\n(Niger), Vice-President, too the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 70 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice (A/69/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/69/337)\r\nMs. Argüello González (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would first like to thank the President of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, Mr. Peter Tomka, \r\nfor the report (A/69/4) he presented this morning (see \r\nA/69/PV.33).\r\nNicaragua aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (see A/69/PV.33).\r\nAmong the international tribunals that have \r\nproliferared in recent decades, the International Court \r\nof Justice continues to play a unique role for States with \r\nregard to the peaceful settlement of disputes between \r\nthem. Nicaragua is an especially strong believer in \r\ninternational law and recognizes the exceptional \r\ncontribution that the principal judicial organ of the \r\nOrganization has made in strengthening international \r\nlaw. \r\nOf the 13 cases in the Court’s Registry, Nicaragua \r\nis a party as an actor and/or a defendant in five, two of \r\nwhich are pending oral hearings that have already been \r\nscheduled for 2015. In all the cases to which my country \r\nhas been a party, it has always faithfully fulfilled its \r\ninternational obligations. We expect reciprocity in the \r\nfulfilment of the obligation to abide by the rulings of \r\nthe International Court of Justice in cases in which it \r\nis party, while we recall that the existence of a dispute \r\nshall not permit the use of force or threat of force by \r\nany of the States parties to the dispute.\r\nRegarding the recognition of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction, it is notable that in 2014 a record number \r\nof complaints, seven in total, have been registered in \r\nwhich the Court’s jurisdiction is based on the future \r\nconsent of the defendant. The situation created by \r\nsuch requests underscores the importance of States \r\ncomplying with their commitments to promoting the \r\nrule of law at the international level and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. The latter is an obligation under \r\nthe Charter and the former is a commitment of Member \r\nStates reaffirmed every year, particularly at the 2012 \r\nHigh-level Meeting of the General Assembly on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels \r\n(see A/67/PV.3-A/67/PV.5).\r\nIn that regard, it is worth recalling that the General \r\nAssembly has noted on more than one occasion that \r\nrecourse to the judicial settlement of legal disputes, \r\nin particular their referral to the International Court \r\nof Justice, should not be considered an unfriendly \r\nact between States. Nicaragua therefore considers it \r\nworthwhile to reflect on the opportunity presented by \r\nthis exceptional situation of demands based on future \r\nconsent, which highlights precisely the importance of \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.34\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n34th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 30 October 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

However, we regret that the number of such \r\nstatements - 70 - is still rather low in comparison to \r\nthe 193 States Members of the Organization. The \r\ncelebration of the seventieth anniversary of the Court, \r\nscheduled for 18 April 2016, will provide a unique \r\nopportunity for more States to make their statements \r\nin accordance with the Statute or to withdraw their \r\nreservations prior to said actions. In so doing, States \r\ncan contribute to making the celebration even more \r\nmeaningful with a record number of recognitions of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\r\nIn terms of its budget, it is clear that the increase \r\nin the Court’s workload - which is reflected not only \r\nin the seven new cases registered this period  but also \r\nin the increasing complexity of the subjects of the \r\ncurrent cases, which require complex technical counsel \r\n- suggests the need to adjust the financial and human \r\nresources of that institution to today’s reality. That is \r\nsomething our delegations must keep in mind in the \r\ndiscussions of the Fifth Committee in order to provide \r\nadequate support for its work.\r\nIt is worth noting that the lack of adequate resources \r\nsometimes means that the Court has to charge the \r\nparties for the costs of certain procedures, such as \r\ntranslations, which is detrimental to less aff luent \r\ncountries. Furthermore, one can assume that the Court \r\navoids, where possible, the hiring of experts, which \r\ncan sometimes also be a disadvantage to less aff luent \r\nStates. Similarly, in relation to budgetary matters, in \r\nthese discussions we should consider the importance \r\nof the publication of rulings and allegations insofar as \r\nthey contribute to the work of dissemination and have \r\nan important role in the academic sphere. Lastly, I recall \r\nthe need to contribute to the Trust Fund to Assist States \r\nin the Settlement of Disputes through the International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nToday, there are different sophisticated threats \r\nto international peace and security, which remind us \r\nof the importance of developing friendly relations \r\namong nations irrespective of their political, economic \r\nand social systems or the levels of their development. \r\nDeveloping and strengthening friendly relations \r\namong States is possible provided that any dispute \r\nbe permanently resolved by the means provided in \r\ninternational law, of which the Court is one of the most \r\nrespected institutions and the principal judicial organ \r\nof this Organization.\r\nWe are grateful for the presentation of the report and \r\nnote that, although much remains to be done to ensure \r\nrespect for justice and international law, we have before \r\nus invaluable opportunities that we must seize in order \r\nto achieve peace, which is the fundamental purpose \r\nof the United Nations and the permanent aspiration of \r\nhumankind.\r\nMr. Nduhuura (Uganda): I thank the President \r\nvery much for the opportunity to address the Assembly \r\non this important subject. I wish to start by thanking \r\nJudge Tomka, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, for the comprehensive report (A/69/4) he \r\nintroduced.\r\nLet me briefly address the issues raised in the report \r\nin Chapter V, section 2, under the subheading “Armed \r\nActivities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo v. Uganda)”. The Court found \r\nthat the parties were under obligation to one another \r\nto make reparations for the injury caused. Provisions \r\nwere also made for the parties to come to an agreement \r\non the question of reparations. Indeed, it is noted that \r\nthe parties have continued to transmit to the Court \r\ninformation concerning the negotiations being held to \r\nsettle outstanding issues.\r\nUganda continues to engage in this process, as \r\nthere is a mechanism by which this particular aspect \r\nof the Court’s decision is being handled. A standing \r\nnegotiating team is seized with the matter and we \r\ncontinue to report to the Court on the status of the \r\nnegotiations. The next meeting between the negotiating \r\nteams will be held on 17 November, and the Court will \r\nbe informed about the progress in that regard.\r\nWe welcome the improvements that have resulted \r\nin the efficient handling of matters before the Court. \r\nThe delivery of justice needs to be timely, because \r\njustice delayed is justice denied.\r\nAs an ardent believer in the rule of law, Uganda \r\nsupports the work of the International Court of Justice. \r\nBeing the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the International Court of Justice continues \r\nto play a positive role in the promotion of the rule \r\nof law and consequently enhances the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. It is noteworthy \r\nthat during the reporting period, the Court registered \r\nincreased activity, including through its judgments and \r\n14-59737 3/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nadvisory opinions. That is a testament to the esteem \r\nwith which the institution is held, but more importantly, \r\nto the increased commitment by States to the rule of \r\nlaw and the peaceful resolution of contentious matters.\r\nAs a result of this engagement, Uganda is living at \r\npeace with the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and \r\nboth States enjoy cordial relations. That has enabled \r\nthe two neighbours to collaborate on various matters of \r\nmutual interest, for example security and trade. Indeed, \r\nthe existing cordial relations have enabled cross-border \r\ntrade, interconnecting roads, combating illegal trade \r\nin minerals and supplying electricity to some parts of \r\neastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, to mention \r\nbut a few. Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo will remain constructively engaged and will \r\nperiodically report on the progress achieved.\r\nMr. Elias-Fatile (Nigeria): As Nigeria commiserates \r\nwith the Republic of Zambia on the death of His \r\nExcellency President Michael Sata on Tuesday, we wish \r\nto express gratitude to delegations for their condolences \r\non the death of the spouse of Ambassador Ogwu on \r\nMonday.\r\nI thank the President for convening this important \r\ndebate on the report of the International Court of \r\nJustice. My delegation is grateful to the President of the \r\nCourt, Judge Peter Tomka, for introducing the report \r\n(A/69/4).\r\nNigeria aligns itself with the statement made \r\nearlier today by the Permanent Representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of African States (see \r\nA/69/PV.33).\r\nThe International Court of Justice is an integral part \r\nof the United Nations mechanisms for the promotion \r\nof the rule of law and international peace and security \r\nthrough the administration of international justice with \r\nindependence and impartiality. Nigeria considers the \r\nCourt the pre-eminent mechanism for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes among States, and it is noteworthy \r\nthat many States have expressed their confidence in the \r\nability of the Court to resolve their disputes. The dual \r\ncharacter of the Court as the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations and court of unique and universal \r\njurisdiction enables it to render impartial decisions \r\nin the peaceful settlement of disputes. The Court’s \r\njudgements and advisory opinions have had salutary \r\neffects on maintenance of peace and security in all \r\nregions.\r\nUnder Article 36, paragraphs 2 and 5 of the Statute \r\nof the Court, States are expected to make declarations \r\nrecognizing the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. \r\nYet Nigeria notes with concern that out of the 193 \r\nStates Members of the United Nations that are parties \r\nto the Statute of the Court, only 70 have thus far made \r\ndeclarations - and some with reservations - in which they \r\nrecognize the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory. \r\nMy delegation therefore encourages Member States \r\nthat have yet to submit to the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court to endeavour to do so, as that would further \r\nstrengthen the Court’s ability to promote international \r\njustice and the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nNigeria realizes the significance of the Court in \r\nthe settlement of inter-State disputes on a broad range \r\nof complex issues, a role that has in no small measure \r\ncontributed to peace and harmony in the world. In view \r\nof that important function of the Court, Nigeria believes \r\nthat its budget should be commensurate to its needs \r\nand obligations and should support its independence to \r\nrender vital services to the international community. \r\nWe therefore note with appreciation that most of the \r\nbudgetary requests of the Court have been accepted by \r\nthe United Nations, thus enabling it to continue to carry \r\nout its mission unhindered, which is commendable.\r\nAs a State party to the Statute of the Court and \r\nhaving made the declaration recognizing the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court as compulsory, Nigeria continues to abide \r\nby its commitment to the promotion of international \r\njustice and the peaceful settlement of disputes. We \r\nencourage all Member States to continue to offer their \r\nsupport to the activities of the Court in order to promote \r\ninternational justice and the rule of law.\r\nMr. Troncoso (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): First of all, \r\nmy delegation would like to express appreciation for the \r\nwork done by the International Court of Justice in the \r\nperiod covered by the report that the Court’s President, \r\nJudge Peter Tomka, introduced earlier (A/69/4). In the \r\nreporting period, the Court had the opportunity to \r\ndecide, in exercise of its jurisdiction, matters relating to \r\nsuch diverse subjects as maritime delimitation, whaling \r\nin Antarctic waters and interpretation of the Court’s \r\nown rulings, among many others.\r\nThe Court, as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, plays a vital and irreplaceable role in \r\nthe interpretation and application of international law, \r\nproviding its decisions for the settlement of disputes \r\nand creating jurisprudence that is a contribution to the \r\n4/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\naccurate determination of the applicable international \r\nlaw. We therefore believe that States should decisively \r\nsupport the work of the Court.\r\nChile has recognized in various international \r\ninstruments the jurisdiction of this high Court and \r\nappreciates that the mandatory settlement of disputes \r\nis linked to those international instruments that by \r\ntheir jurisdictional clauses allow for recourse to a \r\nmechanism to overcome differences that may arise in \r\ntheir application. The role that the Pact of Bogotá has \r\nbeen playing as a basis for the Court’s jurisdiction, \r\nhas been highlighted, and in homage to it, my country \r\nreiterates once again the doctrine that the Pact was \r\nnegotiated with the conviction that it cannot be \r\napplied to deal with matters already settled by prior \r\narrangement between the parties, by arbitral decision \r\nor by ruling of an international tribunal, or which are \r\ngoverned by agreements or treaties in force on the date \r\nof the conclusion of that instrument.\r\nAlso central for my country is respect for \r\ninternational law, in particular international treaties. In \r\nthat spirit, we have complied in good faith with the recent \r\nruling of the International Court of Justice that affected \r\nus, as well as rulings of other international tribunals. In \r\nthat context, I would like reiterate the statement made \r\nby my country on 27 January this year, after reading the \r\nJudgment delivered by the International Court of Justice \r\nin the maritime delimitation case, Maritime Dispute \r\n(Peru v. Chile). At that time, without prejudice to its \r\ndisagreement with certain elements of the decision, \r\nChile agreed to implement the Judgement, stressing \r\nthose aspects that required work by the parties for a \r\ncomplete implementation.\r\nConsequently, we proceeded, together with Peru, \r\nin the joint development of the cartography for \r\ndetermining the exact geographical coordinates of \r\nthe maritime boundary points set forth by the Court, \r\nin a spirit of good-neighbourliness, as ordered by the \r\nCourt in its Judgment. In that regard, it is noteworthy \r\nthat both Governments have said they will make a \r\njoint delivery to the United Nations of the cartography \r\nproduced by their efforts. At the same time, they are \r\npursuing regulatory changes for a more effective \r\napplication of the law of the sea, in accordance with the \r\nspirit and terms of the aforementioned Judgment of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMy country is now facing an application filed \r\nin the Court by the Plurinational State of Bolivia, \r\nrequesting that Chile be obligated to negotiate with \r\nBolivia a sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. Chile, \r\nin full respect of international law and, in particular, \r\nthe provisions of the Pact of Bogotá and the Statute \r\nof the Court and its Rules, has submitted preliminary \r\nobjections to the jurisdiction of the Court in the case, \r\nwhich can be properly resolved by the Court itself.\r\nFinally, we believe it important to provide strong \r\nsupport for the dissemination of the significant work \r\ndone by the International Court of Justice. In this \r\nregard, we recall the settled position in this body, \r\nnamely, the need for Spanish language versions of \r\njudgments issued by the Court, as well as the need \r\nto increase opportunities for academic meetings in \r\ndifferent parts of the world to address the key problems \r\nand future challenges that international law is facing, \r\nand in particular the judicial settlement of disputes, of \r\nwhich the International Court of Justice is an essential \r\ntool.\r\nMr. Koncke (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Peter Tomka, for \r\nintroducing the annual report on the Court’s activities \r\n(see A/69/PV.33). The report (A/69/4) highlights the \r\nCourt’s important work during the year and reflects the \r\ninternational community’s confidence in it as a peaceful \r\nmeans of settling disputes. Each year, the increase in \r\nthe number of cases and the Court’s judgements serve \r\nto confirm its prestige as the organ entrusted with the \r\nsettlement of international disputes and to reaffirm its \r\nrole as the main judicial organ of the United Nations.\r\nSince the Court’s establishment, my country, \r\nUruguay, has championed the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes through all of its actions, in accordance with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Among the measures \r\nlisted in Article 33 of the Charter, today we highlight in \r\nparticular judicial settlements or the use of international \r\ntribunals to provide justice by settling disputes in \r\naccordance with international law. We observe that \r\nthrough both the direct initiatives of countries and \r\nthe provisions incorporated into international treaties, \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction has gradually been extended. \r\nReason, justice and law have thereby gained ground \r\nover arbitrary actions and the use of force.\r\nUruguay is proud to have been the first country \r\nin the world to have accepted the binding jurisdiction \r\nof the International Court of Justice, in the year of its \r\ncreation. In fact, it did so at the beginning of 1921, \r\nwhen the Court’s predecessor, the Permanent Court \r\nof International Justice, was created in the framework \r\n14-59737 5/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nof the League of Nations. That action has guided \r\nUruguay’s international conduct and commitment to \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, the primacy of the \r\nrule of law and justice without conditions, except those \r\nestablished under international law.\r\nIn that vein, we wish to highlight that two years \r\nago my country began working with Switzerland, the \r\nNetherlands and the United Kingdom — later joined \r\nby Lithuania, Japan and Botswana, as countries \r\nrepresenting all of the United Nations regional \r\ngroups — in drafting a manual to assist the Members of \r\nthe Organization in gradually adopting the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice. The \r\nmanual was completed by mid-year and to date has \r\nbeen translated into three of the official languages of \r\nthe United Nations. It is also currently being translated \r\ninto the remaining official languages in order to reach \r\nall Member States.\r\nThe manual is directed mainly at Government \r\nofficials dealing with issues involving international \r\njustice, with practical examples, in order to contribute \r\nto future decision-making related to the acceptance \r\nof the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. We are \r\nconvinced that the task represents no less than the \r\ncommitment of that group of countries to international \r\njustice and its adoption as the primary system for \r\nresolving international disputes.\r\nWithout a doubt, resort to the International Court \r\nof Justice has contributed and continues to contribute \r\nto avoiding confrontations and conflicts that, prior to \r\nits existence, were usually resolved by the use of force. \r\nIn other areas, we are aware that the advisory opinions \r\nreferred to in Article 96 of the Charter and Chapter IV \r\nof the Statute of the International Court of Justice have \r\nshed light on legal gray areas. Furthermore, we have \r\nnoticed that no advisory opinions have been requested \r\nfrom the Court since 2010. In our view, it would be \r\ninteresting to explore the possibility of extending the \r\nCourt’s advisory competence through consultations \r\ninvolving Member States.\r\nWe cherish the hope that ever more States will \r\naccept the Court’s jurisdiction in settling their \r\ndifferences, thereby placing international justice in \r\nthe place of distinction in the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes.\r\nMs. Hamilton (United States of America): We \r\nwould like to thank President Tomka for his leadership \r\nas President of the International Court of Justice, and \r\nfor the recent report regarding the activities of the \r\nCourt over the past year (A/69/4). \r\nWe are again struck by how productive the Court \r\ncontinues to be. Over the past year, the Court issued \r\nthree judgments and 13 orders. In addition, the Court \r\nhas in its pipeline 7 new contentious cases, bringing \r\nto 13 the number of cases on the Court’s docket. They \r\ncover a very wide range of issues.\r\nThe International Court of Justice is the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. The Preamble \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations underscores the \r\ndetermination of its drafters “to establish conditions \r\nunder which justice and respect for the obligations \r\narising from treaties and other sources of international \r\nlaw can be maintained”. That goal lies at the core of the \r\nCharter system, and in particular the role of the Court. \r\nTaking stock today, as we approach its seventieth \r\nanniversary, it is clear that the International Court of \r\nJustice has made significant contributions in multiple \r\nareas of international law.\r\nWe were interested to note that, as President Tomka \r\nexplained in his introduction of the report (see \r\nA/69/PV.33), the cases referred to the Court are growing \r\nin factual and legal complexity and frequently involve \r\na number of phases. We commend the care taken by \r\nthe Court in developing its approach to fact-finding. We \r\nthink that the application of rigorous processes to fact-\r\nfinding will increase confidence in the Court. We are also \r\ninterested to see the number of requests for provisional \r\nmeasures, and the Court has taken commendable steps \r\nto put itself in a position to respond. We hope that the \r\nCourt will continue to receive appropriate resources for \r\ncarrying out its important functions.\r\nWe also want to remark upon the Court’s \r\ncontinued public outreach to educate key sectors of \r\nsociety — law professors and students, judicial officers \r\nand Government officials, and the general public — on \r\nthe work of the Court and to increase understanding of \r\nthat work. From a transparency standpoint, we note in \r\nparticular that the Court’s recordings are now available \r\nto watch, live and on demand, on United Nations Web \r\nTV. All those efforts complement and expand the efforts \r\nof the United Nations to promote the rule of law globally \r\nand a better understanding of public international law.\r\nWe look forward to celebrating, in less than two \r\nyears, the Court’s seventieth anniversary, shortly after \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations itself. \r\nIt will be an opportunity to reflect on the impressive \r\n6/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nlegal jurisprudence developed by the Court. We also \r\nwant to express our appreciation for the hard work \r\nof President Tomka, the other judges who currently \r\nserve on the Court and all the members of the Court’s \r\nstaff who contribute on a daily basis to the continuing \r\nproductive work of that institution.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme first to thank Judge Peter Tomka, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his briefing and for \r\nthe report (A/69/4) describing the Court’s work from \r\n1 August 2013 to 31 July this year. I would also like to \r\nacknowledge those judges who are present among us \r\ntoday.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of African States \r\n(see A/69/PV.33). I will make the following comments \r\nin my national capacity.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, established \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations, is the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. It is the only \r\ninternational jurisdiction of a universal character that \r\nhas dual jurisdiction dealing with contentious cases \r\nand advisory proceedings. That makes it the most \r\naccessible and the most solicited in its rulings on the \r\nlitigation of disputes between States. At the request of \r\nStates exercising their sovereignty, the Court rules on \r\na bilateral or trilateral disputes. That shows that States \r\nhave trust in the Court. We should not surprised, then, \r\nto see that as of 31 July, 193 States were party to the \r\nStatute of the Court. Similarly, more than 300 bilateral \r\nor multilateral treaties and conventions provide for the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction in adjudicating disputes regarding \r\ntheir application or interpretation.\r\nAs for the advisory opinions, besides the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly - which under \r\nArticle 96, paragraph 1 of the Charter are authorized \r\nto request advisory opinions from the Court on any \r\nlegal question - the Economic and Social Council, the \r\nTrusteeship Council, the Interim Committee of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and international organizations have \r\nused the services of the Court. Consequently, due to its \r\nindependence and impartiality, the International Court \r\nof Justice has established itself as the ultimate judicial \r\nbody of the United Nations system.\r\nThe influence of the Court goes well beyond the \r\njudgments and opinions it issues. Many disputes have \r\nbeen resolved early by the mere fact that one party \r\nsuggested submitting the dispute to the Court. In \r\naddition, practice shows that the disputes submitted \r\nto the Court have sometimes been resolved not by a \r\ndecision of the Court, but simply because preliminary \r\nmeasures have helped to resolve them.\r\nIn that respect, one can cite as an example the \r\ncase Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo \r\n(Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda) where, \r\nfollowing the Judgment of the Court, the two parties \r\n“were under obligation to one another to make \r\nreparation for the injury caused. It decided that, \r\nfailing agreement between the parties, the question \r\nof reparation would be settled by the Court and \r\nreserved for this purpose the subsequent procedure \r\nin the case. Since then, the parties have transmitted \r\nto the Court certain information concerning the \r\nnegotiations they are holding to settle the question \r\nof reparation, as referred to in points (6) and (14) of \r\nthe operative clause of the judgment and paragraphs \r\n260, 261”, etc. (A/69/4, para. 79).\r\nSimilarly, Ecuador and Colombia thanked the \r\nCourt for its contribution to the amiable resolution of \r\ntheir dispute on the aerial spraying of herbicides.\r\nAs indicated in the report, in accordance with \r\narticle 89, paragraphs 2 and 3, of the Rules of Court, the \r\nPresident of the Court made an order on 13 September \r\n2013 recording the discontinuance by Ecuador of the \r\nproceedings and directing the removal of the case from \r\nthe Court’s list.\r\nThus the Court performs a function that is an \r\nincentive to negotiation by administering a kind of \r\ntransactional justice to the parties, giving them an \r\nopportunity to settle their dispute by themselves \r\nthrough negotiation. In doing so, the Court has rendered \r\nan invaluable service to the parties to disputes and \r\nperformed a valuable role in facilitating negotiation.\r\nMoreover, the activity of the Court as a whole is part \r\nof the search for peaceful settlement of disputes, on the \r\none hand, and promoting the rule of law, on the other. \r\nIts judgments and advisory opinions will necessarily \r\ncontribute to the clarification of international law and \r\nmake a very important contribution to the primacy of \r\nlaw for the sake of peace. Moreover, the Court plays a \r\nvery important and beneficial role complementary to \r\nthat played by the Security Council to ensure that peace \r\nand international security prevail.\r\n14-59737 7/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nDuring the period covered by the report the \r\nCourt was seized of 7 new contentious cases and \r\nhanded down 13 orders. That shows that the Court is \r\nbecoming increasingly sought out on various topics \r\nconcerning various territorial and maritime disputes, \r\nviolations of territorial integrity and sovereignty, \r\ngenocide, environmental damage and the conservation \r\nof biological resources, the interpretation and \r\nimplementation of international conventions and \r\ntreaties, requests for a halt to the nuclear arms race and \r\nso on. All that testifies to a very positive assessment \r\nand a high degree of satisfaction, trust and efficiency, \r\nwhich contribute to the universality of the Court.\r\nThat vast area of work requires the mobilization \r\nof skilled human resources and adequate financial \r\nresources in order to maintain a high level of \r\neffectiveness, quality and impartiality. The Court \r\nhas increasingly become part of a dynamic that \r\nprogressively fits it in with international mores, in the \r\ninterest of respect for the primacy of the rule of law. \r\nMy delegation is therefore pleased that most of the \r\nbudgetary requests for the biennium 2014-2015 were \r\nmet.\r\nThe Court’s judgments, advisory opinions and \r\ndecisions deserve to be widely disseminated and \r\npublished, particularly in law schools, and especially \r\non my continent, Africa, in order to better disseminate \r\nthe values of the Court and the principles governing \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and to contribute to \r\npreventive diplomacy. The President of the Court, the \r\nRegistrar, the judges and senior officials of the Court \r\nshould organize lectures in universities and diplomatic \r\nacademies in order to make the Court’s work better \r\nknown. The Diplomatic Academy of the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco will be delighted and honoured to have the \r\nPresident of the Court, the Registrar or its judges come \r\nto give lectures in order to stimulate the intellectual \r\ncuriosity of young diplomats so that they would know \r\nabout the role of the Court. Similarly, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco is home to one of the most ancient and \r\nprestigious universities in the world, the Al-Karaouine \r\nUniversity, founded in 857, whose laureates have \r\ncontributed through their thinking to the evolution of \r\ninternational law. The university has a large library that \r\ncontains manuscript treasures and works dating from \r\nprevious centuries up to the present day. If we were \r\nto have the publications of the Court at the university \r\nthat would be extremely useful to both researchers and \r\nstudents, whether Moroccan or foreign.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without stating \r\nonce again how greatly my delegation appreciates the \r\nimportant role played by the Court in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as well as its valuable \r\ncontribution in strengthening and interpreting the rules \r\nof international law.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar) (spoke \r\nin French): The delegation of Madagascar associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of African States \r\n(see A/69/PV.33).\r\nWe wish to express our gratitude to Judge Peter \r\nTomka, President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nwho is present here, for his outstanding presentation \r\nof the Court’s activities during the past year, which \r\nhas allowed us to appreciate the efforts that organ \r\nundertook in the performance its tasks. We read with \r\ninterest the report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/69/4).\r\nThe world is facing many challenges that call for \r\nour attention and collective action. According to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the International Court \r\nof Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. It is therefore an integral element of the United \r\nNations system at the service both of the Organization \r\nand its States Members. Its mandate is unique. Its \r\nuniversal nature makes it the preferred mechanism \r\nand strategic instrument to settle disputes peacefully. \r\nThe increase in the volume of cases before the Court \r\ndemonstrates the confidence of States in the Court. By \r\nadopting the spirit of impartiality and independence \r\nin accordance with international law, the International \r\nCourt of Justice is promoting the rule of law, while its \r\ndecisions are based on legal criteria in order to render \r\nfair, well-founded judgments.\r\nImproving access to justice is an essential means \r\nof strengthening the links between the rule of law \r\nand the three pillars of the United Nations system. \r\nAs the principal judicial organ, the International \r\nCourt of Justice has a central place in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, as well as in \r\naddressing issues essential for development. Its broad \r\njurisdiction — which extends to all cases submitted \r\nto it by parties and all matters specially provided for \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations or in treaties or \r\nconventions in force — provides Member States with \r\nan effective instrument to settle their differences. \r\n8/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nFor that reason, recognizing the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nis essential. That jurisdiction covers both contentious \r\nand advisory matters. Currently, 70 Member States, \r\nincluding Madagascar, have recognized the Court’s \r\njurisdiction to settle disputes. We call on those States \r\nthat have not yet done so to recognize its jurisdiction. \r\nWe express our gratitude for the initiative undertaken \r\nby Switzerland, the Netherlands and other States \r\nduring the High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels, held on 24 September \r\n2012 (see A/67/PV.3-A/67/PV.5) for collaboration \r\nwith the Secretariat in drafting a handbook to assist \r\nStates in accepting the compulsory jurisdiction of \r\nthe International Court of Justice (A/68/963, annex). \r\nThat initiative reflects the spirit of promoting the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court as a peaceful way \r\nto settle disputes and shows the support that Member \r\nStates of all regions of the world attach to it.\r\nWhen it comes the activities of the Court, we \r\nappreciate the various initiatives that the Court has \r\ntaken during the visits of prominent individuals and \r\ndignitaries, especially the exchange on cooperation \r\nbetween the Court and the Secretariat’s Office of Legal \r\nAffairs, the rule of international law in the modern \r\nworld, the Court’s jurisprudence and the Court’s \r\nrole in the international legal system. There was the \r\norganization of a seminar for members of the East \r\nAfrican Court of Justice and of the Supreme Court \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania, and the visit by \r\nacademicians, researchers and legal experts. These \r\nshow the constant attention that the Court has given to \r\npromoting international law in the modern world, since \r\ninternational law is an essential basis of the rule of law. \r\nWe are also pleased that celebrations were held during \r\nthe centenary of the Peace Palace in The Hague and \r\nthat such issues were discussed during those events.\r\nThe Court has made laudable efforts in publishing \r\nits decisions and developing multimedia support and \r\nits website at the request of Governments of Member \r\nStates, since the world situation requires that all States \r\ncontribute to settling the issues that concern the world. \r\nTo that end, we support the Court’s request for financing \r\nthe celebration of its seventieth anniversary. The year \r\n2014 was successful for the Court. In that context, \r\nMadagascar welcomes the prospect of celebrating next \r\nyear with all Member States the seventieth anniversary \r\nof that prestigious institution.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The Russian Federation greatly appreciates \r\nthe work of the International Court of Justice as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. We \r\nwould like to thank the President of the Court, Judge \r\nPeter Tomka, for his detailed report. The report of \r\nthe Court (A/69/4) shows that States continue to ask \r\nthe International Court of Justice to be seized of their \r\ndisputes, which demonstrates a very high degree of \r\ntrust in the Court. The standards of justice and the \r\nexpert opinions the International Court of Justice \r\nhas developed are now becoming real guidelines for \r\npolitical and legal decisions taken by States. \r\nWe note that for some years now the International \r\nCourt of Justice has been extremely busy. The subject \r\nmatters it deals with are increasingly varied, as is its \r\nregional coverage. Today the Court decides not only \r\ndisputes about the delimitation of land and maritime \r\nspaces, which is what it mainly did during the earlier \r\nstages of its existence, but also cases on all sorts of \r\ndifferent issues. \r\nAlthough it has a very full agenda, that has not \r\naffected the quality of decisions it hands down. It \r\nis important that the Court continue making a real \r\ncontribution to ensuring the rule of law internationally, \r\nas rightly noted in the report. Everything the Court \r\ndoes is intended to encourage the rule of law. We \r\nwelcome the decision by the Court to publish as broadly \r\nas possible all of its decisions, to develop websites and \r\nto work with academia. These things deserve our full \r\nsupport.\r\nWe think the events to commemorate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the International Court of Justice should \r\nbe high on the agenda of the United Nations next year. \r\nWe believe that, given the undeniable contribution \r\nmade by the Court and its members to ensuring justice \r\nand the rule of law, the Assembly should respond very \r\ncarefully to the concerns voiced by Judge Tomka about \r\nthe material support for the Court and the judges, \r\nparticularly dealing with the question of pensions. \r\nIn early November, there will be elections for \r\nfive new members of the Court. We feel sure that the \r\nvacancies will be filled by excellent judges.\r\nMr. Mendoza-García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): It is an honour for me to participate once \r\nagain in the annual meeting of the General Assembly \r\nto consider the report (A/69/4) on the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the only international \r\ncourt of a universal nature that has general jurisdiction. \r\nMy delegation wishes to thank Judge Peter Tomka, \r\n14-59737 9/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nPresident of the Court, for introducing the Court’s \r\nreport for the period 2013-2014, as well as for his \r\npresence before the Assembly. \r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the work \r\nof the Court was particularly intense. It delivered three \r\njudgments, handed down 13 orders, held public hearings \r\nin four cases and took on seven new contentious cases.\r\nThe peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nis an essential purpose of the United Nations. That is \r\nthe reason that the role of the Court in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and in promoting \r\nthe rule of law on the international level is essential. \r\nIt is the responsibility of the United Nations and its \r\nStates Members to support the Court in carrying out \r\nits tasks. That calls for the United Nations to ensure \r\nthat the Court is able to continue working effectively \r\nand objectively, with complete legal and procedural \r\nindependence on the cases subject to its consideration. \r\nThat is possible only if the Court is guaranteed the \r\nnecessary resources to comply with its mandate, taking \r\ninto account the substantive increase in its workload. In \r\nthat connection, we are pleased that most of the Court’s \r\nbudgetary requests have been accepted, which will \r\nmake it possible for the Court to carry out its mission \r\nunder the best conditions.\r\nCosta Rica believes it necessary to consider the \r\npossibility of incorporating the Spanish language as an \r\nofficial working language of the International Court of \r\nJustice.\r\nA basic requirement for strengthening the rule of \r\nlaw and the Court itself is for States to observe and \r\nabide by its decisions, both judgments and orders, and \r\nultimately all of the interim measures imposed, without \r\nexception. That compliance must be full and in good \r\nfaith in order to guarantee the integrity of each case and \r\nconsolidate the Court’s uncontested role in ensuring \r\njustice and peace. In addition, the Organization should \r\nconsider the possibility of following up on decisions \r\nand identifying cases of non-compliance in order to \r\navoid situations of non-observance that violate the rule \r\nof law.\r\nAlthough 193 countries are party to the Statute of \r\nthe Court, only 70 have made declarations recognizing \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court in accordance \r\nwith Article 36, paragraphs 2 and 5 of the Satute. Costa \r\nRica, which has accepted its compulsory jurisdiction \r\nsince 1973, has noted with concern that in recent years \r\nthe number of countries recognizing the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court has not increased. Although \r\nthat has not affected the legal activities of the Court, we \r\nwould respectfully urge States that have not done so to \r\nconsider using the mechanism provided in Article 36 of \r\nthe Court’s Statute.\r\nFor a number of years the Court has made significant \r\ncontributions to the development of international law \r\nthrough its judgments and advisory opinions since it \r\nsettled its first case, Corfu Channel (United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland v. Albania). In \r\nthat regard, we commend the statement made by the \r\nPresident at the centennial celebration of the Peace \r\nPalace:\r\n“The Court will continue to work hard to \r\nmeet these challenges as they arise, always careful \r\nto settle the disputes submitted to it faithfully \r\nand impartially, as dictated by the noble judicial \r\nmission entrusted to it under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.”\r\nCosta Rica reaffirms its absolute respect for the \r\ninstruments and organizations of international law and \r\nits commitment to respecting and complying faithfully \r\nwith all decisions handed down by them. We reiterate \r\nour full trust that the Court will continue to strengthen \r\npeace and justice through the exercise of its duties.\r\nMr. Belaid (Algeria): First of all, I would like \r\nto express our appreciation to the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Peter Tomka, for \r\nthe exhaustive report he presented (see A/69/PV.33) on \r\nthe activities of the Court for the past year (A/69/4).\r\nAlgeria aligns itself with the statements made by \r\nthe representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran, who \r\nspoke on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa, who spoke on behalf of \r\nthe Group of African States (see A/69/PV.33).\r\nMy delegation would like to highlight the \r\nundeniable role of the International Court of Justice in \r\npromoting international peace and security, particularly \r\nthrough the fulfilment of its mandate relating to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes in accordance with the \r\nrules of international law and the principles of justice. \r\nIndeed, despite the establishment of many specialized \r\njurisdictions at the international and regional levels to \r\naddress many emerging issues, the International Court \r\nof Justice remains the only jurisdiction that enjoys \r\nuniversality. The Court has a unique position within the \r\ninternational legal framework, given the fact that it is \r\nembodied in the United Nations Charter as the principal \r\n10/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\njudicial organ of the Organization. We may recall that \r\nits Statute forms an integral part of the Charter.\r\nThe Court’s work has grown significantly \r\nthroughout the years in terms of factual and legal \r\ncomplexity. The Court has been entrusted with the \r\nmandate to resolve many contentious cases from all \r\nover the world, involving a wide range of subjects, such \r\nas territorial and maritime disputes, environmental \r\ndamage, violation of territorial integrity, violation of \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights and \r\nmany other matters. In that regard, my delegation \r\nreiterates its full support for the Court’s key role \r\nin ensuring the implementation of the provisions \r\nof international law, adjudicating disputes between \r\nStates and providing advisory opinions to them and to \r\ninternational organizations on how best to assume their \r\nroles and functions.\r\nIn that context, we would like to emphasize the \r\nimportance for all States, without exception, to abide \r\nby their legal obligations and comply with the decisions \r\nof the International Court of Justice in cases to which \r\nthey are parties. It is also important for the United \r\nNations, particularly the Security Council and the \r\nspecialized agencies, to request advisory opinions from \r\nthe International Court of Justice on legal questions \r\nwhen needed. The high moral and legal value of the \r\nCourt’s advisory opinions would certainly promote \r\nboth international peace and security and the rule of \r\nlaw.\r\nThe positive contribution of the International Court \r\nof Justice in promoting and advancing the rule of law \r\nat the international level was strongly highlighted and \r\nvalued by the Heads of State and Government during \r\nthe High-level Meeting on the Rule of Law at the \r\nNational and International Levels, held in New York on \r\n24 September 2012 (see A/67/PV.3 et seq). By fulfilling \r\nits two main functions under the United Nations Charter, \r\nthe International Court of Justice has contributed, over \r\nthe last six decades, to the development and codification \r\nof the rules of international law and consolidated the \r\nprinciples of justice and equality at the international \r\nlevel.\r\nFinally, as outlined in the report,\r\n“The Court’s sustained level of activity has been \r\nmade possible thanks to a significant number of \r\nsteps taken by it over recent years to enhance its \r\nefficiency and enable it to cope with the steady \r\nincrease in its workload.” (A/69/4, para. 9)\r\nIn that regard, my delegation commends all the efforts \r\nmade so far to that end and reaffirms its confidence \r\nin the Court’s ability to carry out its mission using the \r\nsame meticulous and impartial methods with a high \r\nlevel of effectiveness.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia) (spoke in Spanish): The Plurinational State \r\nof Bolivia wishes to express thanks for the report of \r\nthe International Court of Justice covering the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 (A/69/4) and for the \r\nreport to the Assembly by the President of the Court, \r\nJudge Peter Tomka (see A/69/PV.33).\r\nBolivia, as a pacifist State, supports the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the principles upon which \r\nthe International Court of Justice is based. The Court’s \r\njurisdiction is an expression of the permanent call for \r\ndialogue among neighbouring and brotherly States. \r\nThe Court and its purposes and principles open up new \r\nopportunities for resolving our differences by peaceful \r\nmeans. The Plurinational State of Bolivia is convinced \r\nthat the International Court of Justice is one of the best \r\npaths for the peaceful settlement of disputes between \r\nStates. Bolivia urges all States to honour the Court’s \r\njurisdiction and decisions in good faith as peaceful \r\nalternatives and settlements of disputes in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\r\nBolivia also calls for the provisions of resolution \r\n67/1 to be observed. In that resolution, Member States \r\nreaffirm their obligation to settle their disputes through \r\npeaceful means, including judicial arrangements. In \r\nthat same vein, the Manila Declaration on the Peaceful \r\nSettlement of International Disputes provides that \r\nrecourse to a legal arrangement does not constitute an \r\nunfriendly act between the States involved.\r\nInternational law is the basis for the decisions of \r\nthe International Court of Justice. Therefore, Bolivia \r\nwould like to once again highlight the importance \r\nof implementing its decisions. In the Court’s 9 July \r\n2004 advisory opinion on the Legal Consequences of \r\nthe Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian \r\nTerritory, the Court calls on all States to respect and \r\nguarantee compliance with the decisions made by the \r\nCourt.\r\nIt is equally important to highlight that the Bolivian \r\ndelegation supports the need to dedicate sufficient \r\nbudgetary resources for the Court to function and for \r\nthat provision to be made in a timely manner. We would \r\nalso like to highlight the effort to publish the manual \r\n14-59737 11/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nof the Court in the six official languages of the United \r\nNations, which contributes to the work of all States.\r\nLastly, Bolivia reaffirms its commitment to the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and reiterates its \r\nadherence to the provisions of international law and the \r\nprovisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMs. Sealy Monteith (Jamaica): My delegation joins \r\nin the expressions of sympathy to the Government and \r\nthe people of the Republic of Zambia on the passing of \r\nPresident Michael Chilufya Sata.\r\nI extend my appreciation to the President for leading \r\nthe work of the General Assembly. I also thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nPeter Tomka, for the report (A/69/4) that has informed \r\nour discourse today.\r\nJamaica associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (see A/69/PV.33).\r\nJamaica joins the rest of the international community \r\nin underscoring the importance of the Court and its \r\ninvaluable role in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and in the development, promotion \r\nand protection of the rule of law. Over the decades, the \r\nCourt has been instrumental in resolving inter-State \r\ndisputes through peaceful means, thus averting in \r\nmany instances situations that could have led to war. \r\nThe increased activity of the Court is in itself evidence \r\nof a greater willingness by States to resort to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and confidence in the \r\nCourt to provide effective solutions that ultimately \r\nresult in securing international peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe current report highlights the fact that the \r\nvariety of issues presented before the Court has grown \r\nin complexity over the years. It is noted that during this \r\njudicial year alone, the Court has been presented with \r\nissues ranging from border delimitation and dispute \r\nmatters, violations of sovereign rights and genocide, \r\nto matters concerning road construction, the seizure \r\nand detention of certain documents and data and aerial \r\nherbicide spraying. Additionally, the report notes that \r\n70 States have now made a declaration recognizing as \r\ncompulsory the jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice, in keeping with Article 36 of its Statute. \r\nThat is an indication of the growing confidence by \r\nMember States in the Court to exercise its mandate in \r\nan independent manner while maintaining the highest \r\nstandards, in accordance with international law.\r\nThe value of the work of the Court to the Caribbean \r\nand Latin American region cannot be overstated. It is \r\nnoted that the present report highlights that 6 of the \r\n13 cases dealt with by the Court in the past year related \r\nto territorial disputes within the region. That is a clear \r\nillustration of the faith that the region places in the \r\nCourt’s capacity, as the highest judicial body of the \r\nUnited Nations, to settle critical inter-State disputes.\r\nThe report also points to the growing factual and \r\nlegal complexity of the cases referred to the Court \r\nand the high volume of work undertaken during the \r\njudicial year 2013-2014. It is noted that during that \r\nperiod judgments were delivered in 3 cases, 13 orders \r\nwere handed down, public hearings were conducted in \r\n4 cases and the Court was seized of 7 new cases. The \r\nhigh volume of work undertaken not only speaks to the \r\nimportance and usefulness of that esteemed body but \r\nis an affirmation of the efficiency and ability of the \r\nCourt to carry out its mandate with impartiality and \r\nindependence.\r\nIn view of the need for continued efficiency of \r\nthe Court to deal with the number of cases, Jamaica \r\nsupports the view that the Court should continue to be \r\nadequately resourced to meet the increased workload.\r\nJamaica respects the judgments and decisions of \r\nthe Court as fundamental to its mandate of upholding \r\nand promoting the rule of law. The wide publication \r\nof, and access to, its decisions is indeed laudable, as \r\nit contributes to strengthening and clarifying the rule \r\nof law. Small States such as ours appreciate that there \r\nis easy access to information on legal developments \r\nthrough various media. One case in point is the efficient \r\nposting of judgments on the Court’s website, which \r\nprovides a user-friendly environment for research.\r\nJamaica commends the Court’s public outreach \r\nefforts over the period under consideration. We fully \r\nconcur with the President that, in carrying out its \r\njudicial functions, the Court helped to further advance \r\nthe objectives and principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, not the least of which was the \r\npromotion of the rule of law. We commend the Court \r\nfor its use of various media in publicizing its work, \r\nincluding its annual publication, print and electronic \r\nmedia and online services and resources to disseminate \r\ninformation to the wider public. Jamaica believes \r\nthat public education and sensitization are essential \r\ningredients in the promotion of the rule of law and in \r\ninspiring greater confidence in the Court.\r\n12/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nAs the Court celebrates its seventieth anniversary, \r\nit is only fitting that there be heightened public-\r\ninformation activities aimed at highlighting the work \r\nand relevance of the Court. We take note of the schedule \r\nof activities planned and look forward to participating \r\nin those events.\r\nIn conclusion, Jamaica acknowledges that the \r\nsignificance of the work of the Court surpasses that of \r\njudicial processes, functions, convincing arguments \r\nand submissions. The decisions and opinions delivered \r\nare far-reaching in effect and have a significant impact \r\non the daily lives of ordinary men and women. In \r\nthat regard, we commend the judges and staff of the \r\nCourt for the seriousness and dedication with which \r\nthey address and consider the cases brought before \r\nthem. We hold the view that this, the highest court at \r\nthe international level, should continue to benefit from \r\nthe experience and professional attributes of those who \r\nstand in the vanguard of the law in all its expressions \r\nand from all legal systems and regions.\r\nJamaica reiterates its belief in the principles \r\nunderpinning the work of the Court and reaffirms its \r\nsupport for the advancement of its objectives.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank Judge Peter Tomka, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for \r\nhis presentation of the report of the Court (A/69/4) \r\nfor the period of 1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 (see \r\nA/69/PV.33).\r\nMalaysia also wishes to associate itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (see A/69/PV.33).\r\nMalaysia recognizes and commends the important \r\nrole played by the International Court of Justice \r\nas a principal organ of the United Nations in the \r\ndevelopment of international law, and its contribution \r\nto the peaceful settlement of international disputes and \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nMy delegation deeply values the Court’s adherence to \r\nits prescribed mandates and its observance of the rule \r\nof law. We believe that such adherence undoubtedly \r\nserves to increase the confidence of Member States and \r\nnon-Member States alike in the Court’s effectiveness \r\nin fulfiling its role as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe also commend the noble efforts undertaken \r\nby the Court to increase public awareness and \r\nunderstanding of its important work in the judicial \r\nsettlement of international disputes, its advisory \r\nfunctions, case law and working methods, as well as \r\nits role within the United Nations, including through its \r\npublications and lectures.\r\nMalaysia is committed to the pacific settlement \r\nof international disputes through peaceful means. Our \r\ncommitment is clearly evidenced by the fact that we \r\nhave resolved our differences with our neighbours \r\npeacefully through the Court, namely, in the cases \r\nSovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan \r\n(Indonesia/Malaysia) and Sovereignty over Pedra \r\nBranca/Pulau Batu Puteh, Middle Rocks and South \r\nLedge (Malaysia/Singapore). While Malaysia does not \r\nrule out other dispute resolution mechanisms for a \r\nsatisfactory resolution of our claims, we believe that the \r\nCourt has provided the international community with \r\nan important, independent and impartial avenue for \r\nMember States to seek legal recourse for their disputes.\r\nIn relation to this, my delegation believes that \r\nin serious questions concerning disputes among \r\nStates there is a need to pay heed to the important \r\nrole that the International Court of Justice can play. \r\nTo be more specific, Malaysia would encourage the \r\norgans of the United Nations to take advantage of the \r\nCourt’s issuance of advisory opinions, as provided \r\nfor under Article 96, paragraph 1 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We believe that deliberations on \r\ncontentious political issues would be better served if \r\nsupplemented by an authoritative legal opinion. We \r\nfurther recall that there is a precedent for this in a 1971 \r\nadvisory opinion — Legal Consequences for States \r\nof the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia \r\n(South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council \r\nResolution 276 (1970).\r\nMalaysia also wishes to recall that, by way of \r\nresolution 49/75 K, adopted on 15 December 1994, \r\nthe General Assembly, pursuant to Article 96, \r\nparagraph 1, requested the Court to urgently render \r\nits advisory opinion on the question “Is the threat or \r\nuse of nuclear weapons in any circumstance permitted \r\nunder international law?” On 8 July 1996, the Court \r\nrecognized, for the first time in history, that the threat or \r\nuse of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules \r\nof international law applicable in armed conflict and in \r\nparticular the principles and rules of humanitarian law. \r\nThe Court further declared, unanimously, that\r\n“There exists an obligation to pursue in good \r\nfaith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading \r\n14-59737 13/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nto nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under \r\nstrict and effective international control.” (A/51/218, \r\nannex, p. 45)\r\nIn Malaysia’s view, that opinion of the International \r\nCourt of Justice constituted a significant milestone in \r\nthe international efforts aimed at nuclear disarmament, \r\nby lending a moral argument for the total elimination \r\nof such devastating weapons. The pronouncements by \r\nthe highest international legal authority are of historic \r\nimportance and cannot be dismissed. With that opinion, \r\nthe Court set legal parametres whereby the use of \r\nnuclear weapons ignores customary international law \r\nand international treaties. In respect of that advisory \r\nopinion, since 1996 Malaysia has annually submitted \r\na draft resolution entitled “Follow-up to the advisory \r\nopinion of the International Court of Justice on the \r\nlegality of the threat or use of Nuclear eeapons”.\r\nThis year, we are also commemorating the tenth \r\nanniversary of the 9 July 2004 advisory opinion of the \r\nCourt entitled Legal Consequences of the Construction \r\nof a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Malaysia \r\nwas one of the sponsors of resolution ES-10/14, adopted \r\nan 8 December 2003, which requested that opinion. Our \r\ndelegation was one of 15 that delivered oral statements \r\nin The Hague prior to the issuance of the advisory \r\nopinion. In that connection, my delegation wishes to \r\nreaffirm the Court’s conclusion that Israel cannot rely \r\non a right of self-defence or on a state of necessity in \r\norder to preclude the wrongfulness of the construction \r\nof the wall, and that the Court had accordingly found \r\nthat the construction of the wall, and its associated \r\nregime, are contrary to international law.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation underlines our support \r\nfor the significant work carried out by the International \r\nCourt of Justice in the promotion of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. Malaysia is a firm believer in, \r\nand an advocate for, the role of the Court. We have put \r\nthat into practice by resolving our territorial disputes \r\nthrough this mechanism. The Court is an integral part \r\nof the international multilateral system, and we hope \r\nthat all Member States will continue to hold the highest \r\nregard and respect for that important institution.\r\nMr. Tuy (Cambodia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank President Peter Tomka for his leadership as \r\nwell as for his comprehensive report on the work of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (see A/69/PV.33).\r\nMy delegation wishes to recall that, on 11 November \r\n2013, the International Court of Justice announced \r\nits Judgment on the case Request for Interpretation of \r\nthe Judgment of 15 June 1962 in the Case concerning \r\nthe Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) \r\n(Cambodia v. Thailand), as follows:\r\n“The Court,\r\n“Unanimously,\r\n“Finds that it has jurisdiction under Article \r\n60 of the Statute to entertain the Request for \r\ninterpretation of the 1962 Judgment presented by \r\nCambodia, and that this Request is admissible;\r\n“Unanimously,\r\n“Declares, by way of interpretation, that the \r\nJudgment of 15 June 1962 decided that Cambodia \r\nhad sovereignty over the whole territory of \r\nthe promontory of Preah Vihear, as defined in \r\nparagraph 98 of the present Judgment, and that, in \r\nconsequence, Thailand was under an obligation to \r\nwithdraw from that territory the Thai military or \r\npolice forces, or other guards or keepers, that were \r\nstationed there.”\r\nI would like to emphasize that paragraph 98 of the \r\nJudgment clearly defines the location of the promontory. \r\nThis is an important step forward in the historical \r\nsignificance in the efforts made by the Royal Government \r\nof Cambodia to seek a peaceful resolution based on \r\ninternational law to the dispute between Cambodia and \r\nThailand concerning the Temple of Preah Vihear and \r\nits vicinity. In particular, I underscore the fact that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice used the 1:200,000 scale \r\nAnnex 1 map, which was submitted by Cambodia to \r\nthe Court in 1962, as evidence for interpretation of its \r\nJudgment giving a clear direction to the parties for their \r\nsubsequent implementation.\r\nOn this basis, on behalf of the Royal Government \r\nof Cambodia, I would like to reiterate and re-emphasize \r\nthe statement of Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo \r\nHun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia, \r\nto all Cambodian compatriots on 7 November 2013, \r\nconcerning the commitment of Cambodia to comply \r\nwith the common position reached between the Prime \r\nMinster of Cambodia and Her Excellency Ms. Yingluck \r\nShinawatra, former Prime Minister of Thailand. The \r\nstatement was to the effect that, regardless of the \r\noutcome of the judgment of the International Court of \r\nJustice to come on 11 November 2013, the two countries \r\nmust abide by the decision and maintain friendship \r\n14/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nbetween the two nations and peoples, as well as preserve \r\npeace and stability along the border at any cost.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nMoreover, I would like to reaffirm that the Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia will respect and implement \r\nthat commitment in accordance with the spirit of the \r\nmeeting between the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe two nations, Cambodia and Thailand, on 28 October \r\n2013, in Poipet, Banteay Meanchey province, in which \r\nboth parties agreed to further discuss within the \r\nexisting competent mechanisms the implementation \r\nof the judgment of the International Court of Justice. \r\nIn this regard, the Governments of the two countries \r\ncommitted not to do anything to cause any tension and \r\nto prevent anyone from undertaking any act that may \r\ncause tension between the two countries. In the same \r\nvein, the two Governments will pay special attention \r\nto maintaining and strengthening friendly relations and \r\ngood cooperation between the two countries, as well as \r\nto avoid any act that may affect the movement of peoples \r\non both sides of the border, commercial exchange, \r\ninvestment, transport and other areas of cooperation.\r\nMr. Ney (Germany): On behalf of Germany, \r\nlet me first thank President Tomka for his excellent \r\npresentation in this year’s International Law Week. \r\nThe International Court of Justice is an indispensable \r\ninstitution for the settlement of international disputes \r\nthrough peaceful means and in accordance with \r\ninternational law. The Court thus makes a crucial \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. The existence of the Court and its success \r\nconstitute the very antithesis to the idea of might-is-\r\nright.\r\nAs a fervent advocate of the international rule of \r\nlaw, Germany has been an ardent supporter of the Court \r\nfor a long time. A recent example of the importance \r\nGermany attributes to the Court and its work is the \r\ninternational conference on the International Court of \r\nJustice that was organized in January by the German \r\nFederal Foreign Office together with the editors of \r\nThe Statute of the International Court of Justice: A \r\nCommentary. The conference brought together the \r\nPresident of the Court, two of its other judges, former \r\njudges and leading experts on the Court.\r\nOne of the subjects - and this might interest my \r\nfellow legal advisers - that were addressed during the \r\nconference concerned the effect the Court’s consent-\r\nbased and consent-limited jurisdiction may have on its \r\ncapacity to truly contribute to a sustainable settlement \r\nof the underlying conflict between the States involved. \r\nOf course, the consent of the parties must remain the \r\nbasis for the Court’s jurisdiction. There is, however, \r\none specific disadvantage this requirement may have. \r\nIn some cases, acceptance of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nmay be derived only from a specific international \r\ninstrument covering a very specific subject. In this \r\ncase, the Court’s jurisdiction will be limited to that \r\nvery specific subject. A well-known example is the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction under the Genocide Convention: \r\nthis jurisdiction is limited to the subject of genocide. \r\nHence, other international legal aspects of the conflict \r\nunderlying any case of possible genocide will remain \r\na priori outside the Court’s jurisdiction. The result \r\nmay be, by necessity, a somewhat lopsided coverage of \r\nthe legal ground, which in turn might jeopardize the \r\nprospects of settling a conflict through the Court.\r\nBut there is a remedy: the best way to prevent this \r\nconsists in the acceptance of the general jurisdiction \r\nof the Court under the optional clause in Article 36, \r\nparagraph 2, of its Statute by as many States as possible. \r\nGermany made such a declaration in 2008. It thereby \r\nrecognized the Court’s jurisdiction as compulsory. A \r\nfurther increase in the number of such declarations \r\nwould enable the Court to further enhance its \r\nfunction as a prominent facilitator of peaceful dispute \r\nresolution. I would like to call on my fellow legal \r\nadvisers to consider that option within their respective \r\nGovernments if those Governments have not yet made \r\nsuch a declaration.\r\nIf we all wish to support the Court in its work, \r\nrespect for its judgments and the full implementation \r\nof its decisions is of primary importance. Invoking \r\nprovisions of internal law can never be justification for \r\nfailure to comply with international obligations or with \r\nthe Court’s decisions.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on agenda item 70.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto take note of the report of the International Court of \r\nJustice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 70?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\n14-59737 15/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nAgenda item 73\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/69/321)\r\nReports by the Secretary-General (A/69/324 \r\nand A/69/372)\r\nThe President: I welcome Judge Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC), to \r\nthe General Assembly, who will present the report on \r\nthe work of the Court (see A/69/321). \r\nThe ICC was established as an independent \r\ninternational court to fill the historical legal void \r\nrelating to serious crimes such as genocide, war crimes, \r\ncrimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. \r\nGiven its mandate, the principle of universality \r\nremains central to the Court, and we should continue \r\naiming towards it. It should also strive to ensure that it \r\ndispenses justice in a fair and balanced way, in law and \r\npractice alike. When that happens its credibility as an \r\nimpartial and fair institution is enhanced.\r\nI have noted that the Court is reaching out to \r\nstrengthen its cooperation with the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations. That outreach must continue \r\nwith a view to enhancing the complementary role of the \r\nCourt. The Court should also support the primacy of \r\nnational jurisdiction in that regard.\r\nIt is now my honour to welcome to United Nations \r\nHeadquarters His Excellency Mr. Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court. I give \r\nhim the f loor.\r\nMr. Sang-Hyun Song (International Criminal \r\nCourt): Before I begin my presentation, on behalf of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), I would like to join \r\nall those who this morning expressed their condolences \r\nfollowing the untimely death of President Michael \r\nChilufya Sata of Zambia. Zambia was one of the initial \r\nsignatories of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court, and our hearts go out to the people of \r\nZambia and to his family and friends for their loss.\r\nForty-one years ago, the Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 3074 (XXVIII), which recognized the \r\nspecial need for international action in order to ensure \r\nthe prosecution and punishment of persons guilty of \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. During the \r\npast year, the International Criminal Court has been \r\nbusy engaging in exactly such international action, and \r\nI am honoured to present to the Assembly today the \r\nICC’s tenth annual report to the United Nations (see \r\nA/69/321).\r\nWe have reached many milestones in the last \r\n12 months. We now have a first final judgement and \r\nsentence, a conviction in the Germain Katanga case. \r\nThe number of investigations has grown from eight \r\nto nine, and there are an unprecedented six cases at \r\nthe trial stage of proceedings. The ICC has issued the \r\nfirst final ruling that grants an admissibility challenge \r\nby a State, giving way to domestic proceedings. The \r\nCourt has launched its first proceedings on allegations \r\nof witness interference. Ukraine became the second \r\nnon-State party to lodge a declaration accepting the \r\njurisdiction of the ICC. Another seven States parties \r\nratified the amendments to the Rome Statute on the \r\ncrime of aggression, and six States parties ratified the \r\namendments that make the use of chemical weapons in \r\nnon-international conflicts a war crime punishable by \r\nthe ICC.\r\nLet me give a brief overview of the situations in \r\nwhich the ICC is involved. \r\nThe first phase in any situation before the ICC \r\nis a preliminary examination by the Prosecutor, who \r\nwill assess whether the legal and factual conditions \r\nfor opening an investigation are met. That does not \r\nmean the matter must go to the ICC. As representatives \r\nknow, the Rome Statute is built on the principle of \r\ncomplementarity. Domestic courts therefore have \r\njurisdictional primacy — the ICC is a Court of last \r\nresort. Indeed, during the preliminary examination \r\nphase national authorities retain the primary \r\nresponsibility to make sure that any credible allegations \r\nare addressed in a genuine manner, which would make \r\nan ICC investigation unnecessary. That is an integral \r\npart of the Rome Statute system’s impact: encouraging \r\nnational proceedings as a consequence of the ICC’s \r\ninvolvement.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Prosecutor’s \r\noffice opened preliminary examinations in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, Ukraine and Iraq and closed the one \r\nin the Republic of Korea, finding that the requirements \r\nfor an investigation were not met. In Afghanistan, \r\nthe Prosecutor’s Office found a reasonable basis to \r\nbelieve that crimes against humanity and war crimes \r\nhad been committed. Accordingly, the Prosecutor \r\nexpanded the examination to include admissibility \r\nissues. Preliminary examinations also continued in \r\nColombia, Guinea, Honduras and Nigeria, and the Gaza \r\n16/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nFlotilla situation following the referral by the Union of \r\nComoros.\r\nIn the situation of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, several important developments occurred during \r\nthe last year. Mr. Germain Katanga was sentenced to \r\n12 years of imprisonment after he was found guilty of \r\nwar crimes and a crime against humanity in connection \r\nwith the attack on the village of Bogoro in Ituri province \r\nthat took place on 24 February 2003. The verdict and the \r\nsentence became final, as both parties withdrew their \r\nappeals. The proceedings on reparations for victims \r\nhave begun. Thirteen charges of war crimes and five \r\ncharges of crimes against humanity were confirmed \r\nagainst Mr. Bosco Ntaganda. His trial is scheduled to \r\nstart in June next year. The Appeals Chamber expects \r\nto deliver in the months ahead its judgements on the \r\nfinal appeals in the Lubanga and Ngudjolo cases.\r\nIn the situation in the Central African Republic, \r\nfinal arguments in the trial of Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba \r\nare expected next month. However, Mr. Bemba, together \r\nwith four other persons, is also a suspect in a separate, \r\nrelated case concerning allegations of false evidence \r\nand corruptly influencing witnesses. These proceedings \r\nregarding offences against the administration of justice \r\nare unprecedented at the ICC. They demonstrate that \r\nthe Court takes witness interference very seriously.\r\nIn the light of the recent tragic events in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, and following a new referral by its \r\nGovernment, the Prosecutor has decided to open new \r\ninvestigations there. In the situation in Uganda, Joseph \r\nKony and his three co-accused regrettably still remain \r\nat large.\r\nIn the situation in Darfur, the Sudan, Trial \r\nChamber IV issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Abdallah \r\nBanda in the light of information that the Government \r\nof the Sudan would not cooperate in facilitating the \r\naccused’s presence at the trial. Further exchanges are \r\ntaking place with regard to the accused’s ability and \r\nwillingness to appear in Court. He is charged with \r\nalleged crimes in connection with an attack on African \r\nUnion peacekeeping forces in Haskanita. The four other \r\nsuspects in the situation of Darfur still remain at large.\r\nIn the situation in Kenya, the trial of Mr. Ruto \r\nand Mr. Sang continues. In the Kenyatta case, several \r\nmotions by the parties are pending before the Trial \r\nChamber after the recent status conference. In the \r\nWalter Barasa case, regarding allegations of corruptly \r\ninfluencing a witness, the ICC awaits his surrender to \r\nthe Court by the Kenyan authorities.\r\nIn the situation in Libya, the Appeals Chamber \r\nupheld the admissibility decisions of Pre-Trial \r\nChamber I in the two cases before the Court. In the \r\ncase of Saif Al-Islam Al-Qadhafi, the judges found \r\nthat Libya had failed to demonstrate that its domestic \r\ninvestigation covered the same case that is before the \r\nICC. Consequently, Libya is under a duty to proceed \r\nimmediately with the surrender of Mr. Al-Qadhafi. \r\nOn the other hand, the Appeals Chamber confirmed \r\nthe Pre-Trial Chamber’s ruling that the ICC’s case \r\nagainst Mr. Abdullah Al-Senussi was inadmissible, \r\nas it was subject to ongoing domestic proceedings \r\nconducted by the competent Libyan authorities, and \r\nLibya is genuinely willing and able to carry out such \r\nproceedings on the same allegations as those before \r\nthe ICC. Those decisions are an important addition to \r\nthe growing jurisprudence that gives concrete shape to \r\nthe principle of complementarity between the ICC and \r\nnational jurisdictions.\r\nIn the situation in Côte d’Ivoire, Pre-Trial Chamber \r\nI confirmed four charges of crimes against humanity \r\nagainst Mr. Laurent Gbagbo. The trial date will be set in \r\ndue course. In the Simone Gbagbo case, an admissibility \r\nchallenge filed by the Government of Côte d’Ivoire is \r\npending. Mr. Charles Blé Goudé was transferred to \r\nthe ICC in March this year, following the unsealing of \r\nthe arrest warrant. A decision on the confirmation of \r\ncharges is pending.\r\nFinally, in the situation in Mali, the investigation \r\nby the Prosecutor’s Office continues, with an emphasis \r\non the three northern regions.\r\nThis month marks 10 years of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the ICC and the United Nations. \r\nI would like to express the ICC’s sincere gratitude to \r\nthe United Nations for all the support and cooperation \r\nthat we have long enjoyed. We share the same core \r\nvalues. Both organizations are based on the ideals of \r\npeace, security and respect for human rights, and the \r\nrealization that those goals can be attained only through \r\nthe rule of law and international cooperation. Just as \r\npeace and justice go hand in hand, so must the United \r\nNations and the ICC. Our partnership is indispensable \r\nfor a strong international community and the protection \r\nof the interests of humankind as a whole.\r\nAs President of the ICC, it has been one of my \r\npriorities to nurture this important relationship. I am \r\n14-59737 17/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nvery proud of the effective cooperation that we enjoy \r\ntoday in a wide range of areas, and we are keen to explore \r\nways to develop it further. Where the fundamental \r\nbuilding-blocks of society threaten to break down, we \r\noften see the United Nations and the ICC working side \r\nby side with mutually supportive mandates. We greatly \r\nappreciate the assistance we receive from the United \r\nNations in the field on a reimbursable basis. At the \r\nlevel of the broader Rome Statute system, the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies make important \r\ncontributions to strengthening the capacity of national \r\njudiciaries, which in turn helps States provide effective \r\ncooperation to the ICC.\r\nThe winds of renewal are blowing at the ICC. The \r\npermanent premises of the ICC are fast rising in the \r\ndunes along the North Sea. The Court looks forward to \r\nmoving into its new, purpose-built home before the end \r\nof 2015. Next year, the remaining four judges from the \r\nvery first generation of 2003 will leave the ICC. I see \r\nit as a great strength of the ICC that we rejuvenate our \r\njudicial bench with six new judges every three years. \r\nThat guarantees a balance of continuity and fresh \r\nenergy.\r\nMany reforms are now taking place at the ICC. \r\nDrawing lessons from the first wave of pre-trial and trial \r\nproceedings, the judges are streamlining the criminal \r\nprocess through practical innovations. The Prosecutor \r\nhas introduced a new strategic plan, adapting her \r\napproach to investigations and prosecutions in the light \r\nof the experiences of the first cases. The Registrar is \r\noverhauling the support structures of the Court so as \r\nto serve the judicial proceedings in the most effective \r\nand efficient way and to strengthen the ICC’s presence \r\nin the field.\r\nThe ICC is an institution in constant movement, \r\nand so it must be if we wish to respond effectively to \r\nthe ever-changing challenges we face. But we cannot do \r\nit alone. Ultimately, the Rome Statute is only as strong \r\nas States make it. States hold the key to unlocking the \r\nICC’s full potential. The Court has no enforcement \r\npowers of its own. We have the committed support \r\nof 122 States parties. I would like to acknowledge \r\nthe significant contributions that have been made by \r\na number of non-State parties in extending highly \r\nvaluable cooperation to the ICC.\r\nAs President of the Court, I have reached out to many \r\nStates not yet party to the Rome Statute to encourage \r\nthem to join it. I have spoken with Government \r\nleaders, parliamentarians, legal professionals and \r\nrepresentatives of civil society. I have drawn their \r\nattention to the legal protections and deterrent effect \r\nthat the Rome Statute provides. I have underlined the \r\nprinciple of non-retroactivity, which means that joining \r\nthe ICC is an insurance policy for a safer future, not a \r\nmethod of settling old scores. I have highlighted the \r\nnumerous checks and balances built into the ICC’s legal \r\nframework and I have stressed how the values of the \r\nRome Statute reflect global solidarity and commitment \r\nto peace, security and international law.\r\nI am delighted that over recent years the ICC family \r\nhas gained many new members, and I hope and believe \r\nthat this process will continue. It is only by steadily \r\nbuilding global support for the Rome Statute system \r\nthat we will achieve its ultimate aim of universality, \r\nwith the corollary of no hiding place for perpetrators of \r\ninternational crimes. \r\nIn that context, it is of great concern to me that \r\nrequests for arrest and surrender issued by the ICC \r\nstill remain outstanding for 13 persons, some of them \r\nsince 2005. Nine years at large is an affront to justice, \r\nan affront to victims and an affront to the global \r\ncommunity, which wants to see those suspected of \r\nthe most atrocious crimes face the charges levelled \r\nagainst them. But the suspects should not think that \r\nthey have evaded justice. We have seen fugitives from \r\ninternational courts arrested after much longer periods \r\nof time.\r\nNone of that is meant to undermine the presumption \r\nof innocence. It remains a cornerstone of the ICC’s \r\nproceedings at all times, together with legality and \r\ndue process. But the only way for suspects to make \r\nthe charges go away is to confront them at the ICC, in \r\nscrupulously fair proceedings before a court of law.\r\nJust as the ICC respects the rights of suspects and \r\nthe accused, it also strives to provide justice to victims. \r\nParallel to the judicial proceedings at the Court, the \r\nTrust Fund for Victims provides a very concrete \r\nresponse to the urgent needs of numerous victims of \r\ncrimes within the ICC’s jurisdiction. The Trust Fund’s \r\nprogrammes of physical and psychological assistance, \r\nas well as material support, are implemented by locally \r\nbased partners, and they currently support over 110,000 \r\nvictims, their families and communities in Uganda and \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThe empowerment of women and girls is a \r\nfundamental requirement of any justice, reconciliation \r\nand peacebuilding process. Over 5,000 Trust Fund \r\n18/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nbeneficiaries are survivors of sexual and gender-based \r\nviolence. The following is the testimony of Salima, a \r\nvictim of sexual violence in South Kivu, Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, and a beneficiary of a Trust \r\nFund-supported project:\r\n“We had no experience in business. Little by \r\nlittle, I learned through training how to conduct my \r\nsmall business. Now I have two plots of land and I \r\nhave a husband. My husband had his own children \r\nand I came with mine, and all have been educated. \r\nOn one of my plots, I built a house for my children. \r\nI do my small trade and I am contributing to the \r\ndevelopment of my community.”\r\nThe Trust Fund depends upon donations, which may \r\nalso be needed to fund reparations when a convicted \r\nperson is indigent. Once again, I thank those States that \r\nhave generously supported the ICC’s Trust Fund for \r\nVictims with voluntary contributions. I call upon others \r\nto consider doing so, for the benefit of the victims.\r\nThis is the last speech I will give before the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. My mandate as Judge and President will come \r\nto an end next March. It has been a tremendous honour \r\nto serve the ICC in its historic, formative phase. When \r\nthe first 18 judges of the ICC gathered at the interim \r\npremises of the ICC in The Hague 11 years ago, we \r\nwere not certain about the future of the Court. Would \r\nwe be able to turn it from a court on paper into an active \r\njudicial institution? Would States embrace the Court’s \r\nmandate in practice? Would the ICC be able to make a \r\ndifference and have an impact?\r\nMy firm belief is that the answer to all these questions \r\nis a resounding “yes”. What used to be an idea is now \r\na reality. We now have a permanent international body \r\nthat can hear allegations of large-scale international \r\ncrimes and investigate and prosecute such acts when \r\njustice cannot be achieved in national courts. The ICC \r\nhas launched investigations in response to four referrals \r\nby States, two referrals by the Security Council and a \r\ndeclaration accepting jurisdiction by a non-State party \r\nat the time. Our cases involve hundreds of thousands \r\nof victims.\r\nThe ICC’s growing jurisprudence of international \r\ncriminal law builds on the historic achievements of \r\nthe ad hoc tribunals and mixed courts established or \r\nsupported by the United Nations. We have broken \r\nnew ground on issues such as the use of child soldiers \r\nand gender-based violence. The ICC is responding to \r\nhumankind’s call for justice, helping to change the \r\nworld for the better. Instead of being a rare exception, \r\naccountability for international crimes has become \r\nsomething that communities, victims and societies \r\naround the world expect and demand, in keeping \r\nwith the resolve the General Assembly expressed \r\nfour decades ago in its resolution 3074 (XXVIII), of \r\n3 December 1973.\r\nThe perpetrators of mass killings, deportations, \r\nattacks on civilians and rape as a weapon of war can \r\nno longer count on impunity. Today, the prospect of \r\ninternational prosecution helps deter the deadliest and \r\nmost atrocious acts imaginable.\r\nBut we are still far from ending impunity. Billions \r\nof people fall outside the protective cover of the Rome \r\nStatute, and atrocities are rampant in some parts of our \r\nshared planet. It is my dream to see the entire world \r\nunited in a strong system of international criminal \r\njustice that will, above all, help us prevent the worst \r\ncrimes from happening altogether.\r\nWithout the rule of law, there cannot be justice, \r\nthere cannot be sustainable peace, and there cannot \r\nbe universal respect for human rights. I appeal to the \r\n31 signatory States and other States not parties to the \r\nRome Statute to seriously think about joining the ICC. \r\nGive the gift of hope to the children, men and women \r\nof tomorrow.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and \r\nits member States. The candidate countries the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania, the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, as well as Georgia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nAt the outset, we thank President Song for his \r\npresence in New York and for his comprehensive \r\npresentation, and we thank the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its tenth annual report to the United \r\nNations (see A/69/321), covering the period from \r\n1 August 2013 to 31 July 2014 and detailing what is \r\ndescribed as another increasingly busy year for the ICC.\r\nWe are staunch supporters of the International \r\nCriminal Court, and our strong policy in this respect \r\nhas a firm institutional foundation in a detailed 2011 \r\n14-59737 19/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nEuropean Council decision and a 2011 action plan on \r\nimplementation that is adjusted to the evolving activity \r\nof the Court.\r\nWe note from this year’s report that, with 21 cases \r\nin 8 situations at different stages of proceedings, and a \r\nfurther 10 situations under preliminary examinations, \r\nthe ICC is facing an increasing workload. The \r\nProsecutor is currently investigating more allegations \r\nthan in the previous reporting period. We acknowledge \r\nin that regard the opening of preliminary examinations \r\nconcerning allegations of crimes occurring in the \r\nCentral African Republic, Iraq and Ukraine and the \r\nconclusion of the preliminary examination of the \r\nsituation in the Republic of Korea. We welcome the \r\nfirst final verdict of the ICC in the case The Prosecutor \r\nv. Germain Katanga, of June 2014.\r\nThe Court has given hope to the victims of the \r\nmost serious crimes. During the reporting period, \r\nmore than 3,000 applications for participation and \r\n2,500 applications for reparations were registered. We \r\nwelcome the fact that 20 States have contributed to the \r\nTrust Fund for Victims. We encourage others to do the \r\nsame.\r\nThe recent report of the ICC describes the efforts \r\nthat the Court has made in fulfilling its mandate. It also \r\ndescribes the challenges that the ICC is facing.\r\nAlthough no new State has ratified the Rome Statute \r\nor the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of \r\nthe Court during the reporting period, we note that \r\neight States ratified the amendments on the crime of \r\naggression and nine States ratified amendments on \r\ncertain crimes in non-international armed conflicts. \r\nWe welcome the fact that Ukraine, a State not party \r\nto the Statute, accepted the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nthrough a declaration of 17 April 2014 on alleged \r\ncrimes committed on its territory from 21 November \r\n2013 to 22 February 2014.\r\nEnsuring the universality of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich continues to be one of the main challenges faced \r\nby the ICC, is essential for guaranteeing accountability \r\nfor the most serious crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community. Perpetrators of such crimes, \r\nregardless of their status, must be held accountable \r\nfor their actions. A key element in the Rome Statute is \r\nits equal application to all persons without distinction \r\nbased on official capacity.\r\nWe need to continue to work tirelessly to \r\nmake the Rome Statute truly universal. During the \r\nreporting period, we continued to engage in promoting \r\nthe universality of the Rome Statute, increasing \r\nparticipation in the Agreement on the Privileges \r\nand Immunities of the International Criminal Court \r\nand promoting a better understanding of the Court’s \r\nmandate. We did that through démarches and dialogue \r\nin third States and international organizations, such \r\nas the League of Arab States and the African Union, \r\nthrough the organization of dedicated local or regional \r\nseminars, the systematic inclusion of an ICC clause \r\ninto agreements with third countries and financial \r\nsupport to civil society organizations lobbying for \r\nthe universality of the Rome Statute. Since 2003, the \r\nEU has provided more than €30 million to the global \r\nratification campaigns undertaken by civil society and \r\nto projects of the ICC.\r\nThe primary responsibility for bringing offenders \r\nto justice lies with States themselves, in conformity \r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute. \r\nComplementarity is a core principle in the Rome \r\nStatute. In order to make it operational, all States \r\nparties need to prepare and adopt effective national \r\nlegislation to implement the Rome Statute in national \r\nsystems. We are currently conducting démarches to \r\nidentify needs to assist countries in enhancing their \r\ninstitutional and legal capacity to integrate the Rome \r\nStatute domestically.\r\nAnother fundamental challenge remains, and \r\nthat is the necessity to ensure cooperation with the \r\nICC and, in particular, how to react to instances of \r\nnon-cooperation by States that are in violation of their \r\nobligations with regard to the ICC. Cooperation with \r\nthe Court and enforcement of its decisions are indeed \r\nequally essential to enabling the Court to carry out its \r\nmandate. That applies to all States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute and when the Security Council has referred a \r\nsituation to the Court in accordance with Chapter VII \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe note with concern that arrest warrants issued \r\nby the Court remain outstanding, some since 2005. We \r\nrecall that non-cooperation with the Court in respect of \r\nthe execution of arrest warrants constitutes a violation of \r\ninternational obligations and stif les the ICC’s capacity to \r\ndeliver justice. We call upon all States to take consistent \r\nactions to encourage appropriate and full cooperation \r\nwith the Court, including the prompt execution of arrest \r\nwarrants. We also reiterate the crucial importance of \r\nall States refraining from helping to shelter or hide the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes and taking the \r\n20/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nnecessary steps to bring those perpetrators to justice in \r\norder to end impunity. A further additional challenge \r\nremains in that the Court’s proceedings must be fair and \r\nexpeditious, while preserving the rights of the accused. \r\nWe therefore support the Court’s work in seeking to \r\nexpedite proceedings.\r\nWe welcome the actions undertaken by States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society to increase \r\ncooperation with and assistance to the ICC. We \r\nparticularly praise the ongoing cooperation of the United \r\nNations with the Court, at the level of Headquarters, \r\nspecialized institutions and field missions, which \r\nis acknowledged in the report. We also welcome \r\nthe recent United Nations practice of informing the \r\nProsecutor and the President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute beforehand of any meetings \r\nwith persons who are the subject of arrest warrants \r\nissued by the Court that are considered necessary for \r\nthe performance of United Nations-mandated tasks, \r\ndeveloped pursuant to the guidance issued by the \r\nSecretary-General in 2013.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nundertake, on their part, to pursue their efforts in \r\nthe fight against impunity, notably by giving the \r\nCourt full diplomatic support. For the first time this \r\nyear, on the basis of the 2006 Agreement between \r\nthe International Criminal Court and the European \r\nUnion on Cooperation and Assistance, a joint ICC-EU \r\nround table was set up to consult and to ensure regular \r\nexchange on matters of mutual interest, including \r\ncooperation, complementarity, diplomatic support \r\nand mainstreaming, as well as public information and \r\noutreach.\r\nOur common goal remains the same: to further \r\nstrengthen the Court to fulfil its mandate effectively. \r\nThere are States parties to the ICC across all parts of \r\nthe world, and all States parties share ownership of \r\nthe Statute. We will continue to encourage the widest \r\npossible participation in the Rome Statute. We are \r\ndedicated to preserving the integrity of the Statute, \r\nsupporting the independence of the Court and ensuring \r\ncooperation with the Court. We are also committed to \r\nfully implementing the principle of complementarity \r\nenshrined in the Rome Statute by facilitating the \r\neffective and efficient interplay between national justice \r\nsystems and the ICC in the fight against impunity.\r\nMr. Charles (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the \r\nhonour to make this intervention on behalf of the \r\n14 States members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM). \r\nWe also take this opportunity to honour the \r\nmemory of the late President of Zambia, His Excellency \r\nMr. Michael Sata, not only for his contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of his country, but also for his dedication \r\nto the work of the International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nCARICOM continues to play a pivotal role in \r\nupholding the purposes and principles upon which \r\nthe International Criminal Court was founded. On \r\n9 April, CARICOM and the other members of the \r\ninternational community mourned the passing of the \r\nformer Prime Minister and President of Trinidad and \r\nTobago, His Excellency Mr. Arthur Robinson, who was \r\nrecognized globally for his pioneering work resulting \r\nin the adoption of the Rome Statute in 1998, which \r\nestablished the International Criminal Court. As a \r\nregion, CARICOM strongly supports the mandate of \r\nthe ICC and its primary objective to help put an end to \r\nimpunity for perpetrators of the most serious crimes of \r\nconcern to the international community, as a whole, as \r\nwell as to contribute to the prevention of such crimes.\r\nIt is no exaggeration to state that, despite its \r\ndetractors and many challenges, it cannot be ignored \r\nthat the ICC remains a beacon of hope to all victims \r\nof crimes committed within its jurisdiction who are \r\nseeking justice. Those include thousands of women and \r\nchildren, who are those most affected by the actions of \r\ncriminals showing blatant disregard for the sanctity of \r\nhumanity by violating international humanitarian law \r\nand international human rights law. \r\nThe Court continues to grow. More States parties \r\nare becoming adherents to the Rome Statute. It is \r\nCARICOM’s hope that the ICC will gain universality \r\nin the near future.\r\nWe also recognize the renewed and strengthened \r\nrelations between the Court and the United Nations. \r\nIn that regard, we appreciate the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the information relevant to \r\nthe implementation of article 3 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the ICC \r\n(A/69/364). As a result of the symbiotic relationship \r\nthat exists between the United Nations and the ICC, \r\nCARICOM applauds the joint collaboration of the \r\nCourt and this important institution. At the same time, \r\nhowever, we wish once again to reiterate our call on \r\nthe United Nations to meet the costs associated with \r\nthe referrals by the Security Council of situations to \r\n14-59737 21/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nthe ICC. In our view, that would be consistent with \r\nthe relevant provisions of the Rome Statute and the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the Court.\r\nOver the past two years, CARICOM has witnessed \r\nthe tremendous strides made by the Prosecutor of the \r\nICC, Ms. Bensouda, to discharge her mandate. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the launch by the Prosecutor of \r\nthe ICC’s policy on sexual and gender-based violence, \r\nthe first ever such document to be elaborated by an \r\ninternational court or tribunal. At the same time, \r\nCARICOM also applauds the President of the ICC, \r\nJudge Song, for introducing the annual report of the \r\nICC (see A/69/321) and wishes to place on record our \r\nappreciation for his sterling work in shaping the ICC \r\nsince his first election to the Court in 2003. It is our \r\nview that as Judge Song demits office in March 2015, \r\nhe will be able to take comfort in the fact that he will \r\nbe leaving behind an ICC that is much stronger than it \r\nwas when he entered in 2003. We applaud him for that.\r\nDuring the past year we have also observed the \r\ncontinued work of the Court to bring to justice several \r\npersons accused in numerous situations referred to the \r\ninstitution. Most importantly for us in CARICOM, \r\nthe verdict rendered on 7 March — in which the ICC \r\nfound Mr. Germain Katanga guilty of five counts, \r\nincluding war crimes and crimes against humanity —\r\nand his subsequent sentencing in May bode well for \r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nAt this juncture, we hope that States parties, \r\nwhen selecting judges at elections in December at \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, \r\nscrupulously observe the relevant provisions of article \r\n36 of the Rome Statute and elect only those persons who \r\nmeet the absolute criteria and experience for election as \r\njudges to the ICC. Failure to do so could result in the \r\nbench of the Court being held by individuals who will \r\nnot gain the confidence of the international community.\r\nWe in CARICOM are satisfied that at each stage of \r\nthe proceedings in the case of The Prosecutor v. Germain \r\nKatanga, the ICC adhered to all of the tenets associated \r\nwith the conduct of an impartial trial. In addition to the \r\nsentencing of Mr. Katanga, CARICOM also commends \r\nthe Court for its landmark decision on reparations for \r\nvictims. That decision, in our view, is comprehensive \r\nin scope, as it also establishes principles relating to \r\nreparations.\r\nIt is CARICOM’s hope that in the near future the \r\nICC will be in a position to commence the trial of other \r\nindividuals who are accused of committing crimes \r\nunder article 5 of the Rome Statute. But if that objective \r\nis to be achieved, the relevant entities must honour their \r\nlegally binding obligations to execute the outstanding \r\narrest warrants issued by the Court and arrest and \r\nsurrender to the ICC those individuals who continue \r\nto evade justice. We wish to remind all those involved \r\nwho have failed to honour such obligations that they are \r\ncontributing to a culture of impunity, which not only \r\nprevents the dispensing of justice, but also serves to \r\nundermine the foundations of the rule of law.\r\nCooperation with the Court is at the centre of \r\nthe Rome Statute, and it does not fall only to States \r\nparties, but also to all States Members of the United \r\nNations, especially as it relates to referrals by the \r\nSecurity Council. Those who argue that the ICC is \r\nan obstacle to achieving lasting peace and security \r\nmust be reminded that, consistent with the doctrine of \r\ncomplementarity enshrined in the Rome Statute, the \r\njurisdiction of the ICC is invoked only when States are \r\nunable or unwilling to prosecute individuals accused of \r\nperpetrating the most severe crimes of concern to the \r\nglobal community. In other words, CARICOM is of the \r\nview that no individual should fear the ICC, because \r\nit is a court of last resort. CARICOM is also satisfied \r\nthat in its 16 years of operations, the ICC has stoutly \r\nadhered to that cardinal principle.\r\nWe also welcome the growing number of \r\nratifications of the Kampala amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute, including those on the crime of aggression. To \r\nthat end, CARICOM further calls on all States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute to ratify the amendments so that \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties can take action in 2017 \r\nto enable their entry into force.\r\nWith the imminent cessation of operations of the \r\nad hoc criminal tribunals, the international community \r\nmust fully embrace the ICC as the only permanent \r\ninternational tribunal dedicated to the prosecution \r\nof all individuals, without distinction as to rank or \r\nstatus, who commit international crimes that have the \r\npotential to undermine the rule of law and the political \r\nand economic stability of States. In that regard, we also \r\necho the words of the ICC Prosecutor, who, at an open \r\ndebate of the Security Council, remarked that justice \r\nplays a crucial role in maintaining international peace \r\nand security (see S/PV.7285).\r\n22/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nFinally, CARICOM remains committed to the \r\nprogressive development of the relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC as part of our overall \r\nsupport for the maintenance of an international regime \r\nbased on respect for the inalienable human rights of \r\nindividuals, respect for the territorial integrity of States \r\nand the need to ensure justice for those who cry out for \r\nhelp and that the perpetrators of the most grave crimes \r\nof concern to the international community do not enjoy \r\nimpunity.\r\nMr. Rönquist (Sweden): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the five Nordic countries: Denmark, \r\nFinland, Iceland, Norway and my own country, Sweden. \r\nLet me start by thanking the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its annual report to the United Nations \r\n(see A/69/321). I would also like to personally thank \r\nJudge Song, President of the ICC, for giving us a \r\nthorough presentation of the main issues addressed in \r\nthe report.\r\nThe Nordic countries would like to express their \r\nsincere appreciation to the Court for its significant \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity worldwide. \r\nFrom the report and President Song’s introduction, it is \r\nevident that the caseload of the Court has continued to \r\nincrease. The activities of the Court have a worldwide \r\nreach, and during the reporting period, the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor opened preliminary investigations \r\nin the Central African Republic, Iraq and Ukraine \r\nand concluded its preliminary examination in the \r\nRepublic of Korea. During the reporting period, the \r\nCourt rendered its first final judgement, in the case of \r\nThe Prosecutor v. Germain Katanga. Six cases are at \r\nthe trial preparation or trial stage, with 8,040 victims \r\nrepresented. The ICC recently finalized an arrangement \r\nwith Libya for the entry and presence of ICC staff, and \r\na similar arrangement is under way with Mali. These \r\nare important achievements. The Court has become \r\nthe most important international actor in efforts to \r\nfight impunity and in the development of international \r\ncriminal law.\r\nVictims’ participation and right to reparations \r\nare unique and essential features of the Rome Statute. \r\nVictims’ issues are key for the Nordic countries, \r\nespecially regarding those who have been subjected \r\nto sexual and gender-based crimes, as well as other \r\nvulnerable persons. We commend the important work \r\nof the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, which has supported \r\nmore than 110,000 victims of crimes under the ICC’s \r\njurisdiction. The Nordic countries had contributed a \r\ntotal of €5.8 million to the Fund as of last year, with \r\nfurther substantial contributions this year. We continue \r\nto encourage States and other actors to contribute to the \r\nTrust Fund, which will enable victims to access their \r\nrights to reparations. In that regard the Nordic countries \r\nare convinced that the full realization of the rights of \r\nvictims is an important aspect of the continuing success \r\nand relevance of the Court.\r\nThe principle of complementarity enshrined in the \r\nRome Statute means that the ICC is to be complementary \r\nto national criminal jurisdictions. Ideally, it should \r\nhave no cases. We must, however, acknowledge that \r\nmany States lack the resources and capacity to conduct \r\ncriminal proceedings for such complex and large-scale \r\ncrimes as genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes. The Nordic countries emphasize the value of \r\ncapacity-building among States parties and stress that \r\nStates parties may also benefit from the knowledge \r\nand expertise of the Court. One concrete example of \r\nour complementarity engagement is the Justice Rapid \r\nResponse facility, which is a support mechanism \r\nfor providing States and organizations with rapidly \r\ndeployable criminal justice professionals trained for \r\ninternational investigations.\r\nThe Nordic countries would like to recall that \r\nthe success of the Court is contingent upon its \r\nhighly qualified and competent judges and staff. The \r\nforthcoming election of judges at the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties in December 2014 will be an important \r\nopportunity for States parties to ensure that the Court \r\nis equipped with the most qualified, competent and \r\nexperienced judges. The Court needs judges with \r\ncourtroom experience, the right skills for managing \r\ncomplex criminal cases, and expertise in international \r\nand national criminal law, international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law.\r\nAnother important topic for the upcoming Assembly \r\nof States Parties will be the annual budget debate. \r\nAlthough the Court and its Office of the Prosecutor \r\nmanage their workload in a commendable manner \r\nwithin the framework of the current budget, it is evident \r\nthat the increased number of situations and cases \r\nnecessitates an increase in the resources available to \r\nthem. As States parties, it is our common responsibility \r\nto ensure that the Court and the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nhave the sufficient staff and other resources to fulfil \r\ntheir mandate. Equally, the resources of the Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims provided for in the Court’s budget must be \r\nsufficient to fulfil its important mandate.\r\n14-59737 23/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\nDespite the success of the ICC, it is a cause for \r\nconcern that the number of outstanding arrest warrants \r\nremains high. Progress has to be made. States’ \r\ncooperation with the Court, including the Office of the \r\nProsecutor, must improve. States parties have a legal \r\nobligation under the Rome Statute to cooperate fully \r\nwith the Court. Therefore, we urge all States parties \r\nto strengthen their efforts to execute the orders of \r\nthe Court, including to avoid non-essential contacts \r\nand abstain from inviting and receiving suspects who \r\nare under an arrest warrant. We would also like draw \r\nparticular attention to the continued need for new \r\nagreements between the Court and States parties on \r\nwitness relocation and protection.\r\nAll States must also fully comply with their \r\nobligations under the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1593 (2005) concerning the \r\nsituation in Darfur. The Government of the Sudan and \r\nall other parties to the conflict in Darfur must cooperate \r\nfully with the Court and the Prosecutor.\r\nThe Nordic countries stress the need for coordinated \r\nand coherent implementation of the policies of \r\ninternational organizations and States on contact \r\nwith persons who are the subject of arrest warrants or \r\nsummons issued by the ICC. By mainstreaming our ICC \r\npolicy into regular bilateral diplomacy, we enhance the \r\nreach and relevance of the Court.\r\nBeing independent does not mean that the Court \r\nstands alone. We are heartened by the detailed \r\ndescription in the report of multifold communication \r\nand interaction between the United Nations and the \r\nICC. However, enhanced support for the Court from the \r\nSecurity Council is required in cases of non-cooperation \r\nwith the ICC, as is strengthened follow-up of cases \r\nreferred to it by the Council. While respecting the \r\nindependence and integrity of the Court, the Council \r\nmust play its part in ensuring accountability when gross \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights law have occurred in any part of the world, such \r\nas in Syria.\r\nThe quest for universal adherence to and \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute continues and \r\nshould be intensified. We also stress the need for all \r\nStates parties and States not parties that have not yet \r\ndone so to ratify and fully observe the Agreement on \r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the ICC as a matter \r\nof priority.\r\nIt should be recognized that the activities of the \r\nICC reach all parts of the world, with the Office of the \r\nProsecutor receiving communications and conducting \r\npreliminary examinations relating to a range of \r\ncountries in different parts of the world. In that regard, \r\nthe Nordic countries welcome the Court’s intention \r\nto increase its presence in the field. The ICC must be \r\nan institution that is both visible and accessible to the \r\npeople on the ground. It is also important to make the \r\nCourt better known in all parts of the world, but this is \r\nparticularly true in the situation countries. For example, \r\npublic debates on the ICC have proven to be a useful \r\nway of disseminating information and exchanging \r\nviews. The Court must also have sufficient resources \r\nfor effective outreach.\r\nVictims of war crimes, crimes against humanity \r\nand genocide, wherever they are found, deserve justice. \r\nThe International Criminal Court was created to take \r\nup the cases that States were not able or willing to take \r\nup. But in today’s reality, an effective and independent \r\nCourt is dependent upon the integrity of the Rome \r\nStatute and effective and comprehensive cooperation \r\nby States. Only then is it possible for the international \r\ncommunity and the Court to pursue the aim of ending \r\nimpunity for past crimes and preventing such crimes in \r\nthe future.\r\nBoth the Court and the States parties are part of the \r\nRome Statute system of international criminal justice, \r\nbuilt upon the principles of complementarity, cooperation \r\nand shared responsibility, to hold perpetrators of mass \r\ncrimes accountable. The independence and strength of \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor are vital in that respect. \r\nWe support the Office’s efforts to use preliminary \r\nexaminations as a tool for complementarity, as such \r\nexaminations provide an opportunity for dialogue \r\nwith national authorities and can encourage national \r\nexaminations and identify possibilities to support \r\nnational authorities in their work. The efforts with \r\nregard to Guinea and Colombia are among such positive \r\nexamples.\r\nThe Nordic countries welcome the Prosecutor’s \r\nambitions to further enhance the efficiency of the \r\nCourt. We especially welcome the Court’s engagement \r\nin important areas such as sexual and gender-based \r\ncrimes, prosecuting crimes against children and using \r\nnew forms of evidence in addition to witnesses.\r\nLet me conclude by renewing our pledge that the \r\nNordic countries will remain principal supporters of the \r\n24/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nICC. We are committed to continuing to work for the \r\nCourt’s effectiveness, professionalism, independence \r\nand integrity.\r\nMr. Hahn Choonghee (Republic of Korea): First \r\nof all, the Republic of Korea would like to express its \r\nsincere gratitude to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Sang-Hyun Song, for his \r\nleadership and his comprehensive report on the current \r\nactivities of the Court.\r\nNext year, President Song will conclude his duty \r\nas the President of the Court, which he assumed in \r\n2009, and that of a judge of the Chambers, which he \r\nassumed in 2003. He has been playing a vital role in \r\nleading the Court towards a brighter future and is a \r\ndedicated ICC judge and passionate President of the \r\nCourt. He has been an important part of the history \r\nof the ICC itself. President Song will be remembered \r\nas one of the champions who devoted themselves to \r\nthe development of the newly established permanent \r\ncourt of international criminal justice and who kept \r\non supporting the rule of law and fighting against \r\nimpunity to advance global justice. As fellow Koreans, \r\nwe are especially proud of President Song’s outstanding \r\ncontribution and remarkable achievement as the \r\nPresident and judge of the Court for such a long period \r\nof time. We would like to thank him.\r\nMy delegation also commends the joint efforts \r\nby the Chambers, the Office of the Prosecutor and \r\nthe Registry, which have laid a solid foundation for \r\nthe effective functioning of the Court. Thus far, the \r\nCourt has demonstrated notable achievements with \r\nits involvement in eight situations. The Office of the \r\nProsecutor has devoted itself to its duties in spite of an \r\nincreased workload in the past year. In particular, we \r\nwelcome the fact that there has been progress in the \r\ncase of Mr. Laurent Gbagbo regarding the situation in \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, which has passed the review of Pre-Trial \r\nChamber I for the confirmation of the charge.\r\nWe also note that the caseload of the Chambers and \r\nworkload of the Office of the Prosecutor has increased \r\nsignificantly in the past year. The ICC has completed \r\nits final judgement and sentence conviction in the case \r\nof Germain Katanga, who was sentenced to 12 years \r\nimprisonment with respect to the situation in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nThere are also many cases in the trial stage, such \r\nas the trial of Mr. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo regarding \r\nthe situation in the Central African Republic. The \r\nAppeals Chamber has been actively performing its \r\nessential function of judicial supervision with respect \r\nto various cases, such as the case of Mr. Lubanga \r\nDyilo and Mr. Ngudjolo Chui. The Chamber also \r\nissued a judgement to uphold the very contrasting \r\nPre-Trial Chamber’s decisions on Libya admissibility \r\nchallenges in two cases. That is attributable to a precise \r\ninterpretation of the principle of complementarity and \r\nrelated articles of the Rome Statute.\r\nDespite the Court’s remarkable achievements, \r\nhowever, much remains to be done in order to accomplish \r\nits mandate. Those goals cannot be achieved completely \r\nthrough the efforts of the ICC alone. Indeed, it is also \r\ncrucial to enhance the international community’s \r\nongoing endeavours in the pursuit of justice, the rule of \r\nlaw and sustainable peace. Building upon the existing \r\nagreement between the United Nations and the ICC, \r\nwe cannot overemphasize how vital it is for the two \r\norganizations to strengthen their relationship further.\r\nFurthermore, it is also critical for the Court to \r\ngarner ample support and cooperation from all Member \r\nStates. Without their full cooperation, the ICC cannot \r\nexecute the outstanding arrest warrants for perpetrators \r\nof grave crimes, nor conduct thorough investigations \r\nfor the appropriate prosecutions. The International \r\nCriminal Court was established in order to embody \r\nthe guiding principles of the Rome Statute — to end \r\nimpunity and contribute to the prevention of grave \r\ncrimes, including genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. To fulfil its mandate fully, the ICC \r\nshould be respected as a non-political, independent \r\nand judicial institution by all stakeholders and by State \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. By doing so, we can expect \r\nthe ICC to continue to pursue criminal accountability \r\nagainst the most serious crimes of international concern \r\nand thus keep making a positive contribution to laying \r\na solid foundation for sustainable global peace in the \r\nfuture.\r\nThe Republic of Korea will always remain one \r\nof the strongest supporters of the Rome Statute and \r\nthe International Criminal Court, and will continue \r\nworking relentlessly to attain that common goal of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nMr. Elias-Fatile (Nigeria): We thank the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Song, \r\nfor the report of the Court (see A/69/321), which is \r\nbefore us for consideration today. We commend him on \r\nhis leadership of the Court throughout the past years \r\nand wish him success in his future endeavours after \r\n14-59737 25/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\ncompleting his ICC assignment next year. We also wish \r\nto take this opportunity to express appreciation to the \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC, Ambassador Tiina Intelmann, for \r\nher work in coordinating the affairs of the Assembly \r\nduring her tenure, which expires in December 2014. \r\nIn the same vein, we congratulate the President-elect, \r\nMr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice of Senegal, and \r\nlook forward to his endorsement at the thirteenth \r\nsession of the Assembly, in December.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the appreciable progress \r\nrecorded by the ICC in the fight against impunity \r\nand crimes against humanity. Nigeria commends the \r\nTribunal for its trailblazing contributions in developing \r\nsubstantive and procedural international criminal law \r\nand the promotion of the rule of law. Through its work, \r\nthe ensuring of accountability for genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes has been strengthened.\r\nThe objective of the ICC is based on the concept \r\nthat impunity must be challenged and that everybody \r\nshould be held accountable for their actions. Therefore, \r\nthe cooperation of States, international organizations \r\nand civil society is vital for the Court to continue to \r\ndischarge its role as enshrined in the Rome Statute. To \r\nthis effect, we commend His Excellency Mr. Uhuru \r\nKenyatta, President of Kenya, who at great personal risk \r\nappeared in The Hague on 8 October as a private citizen \r\nin response to an invitation by the Court. We consider \r\nthat to be the height of cooperation that anyone or any \r\nState can accord to the Court, and it also demonstrates \r\ncommitment to and respect for the rule of law.\r\nHowever, we wish to express our concern that the \r\nICC did not dismiss the case against President Kenyatta \r\ndespite having failed to establish a case against him. \r\nTherefore, we call on the Court to show more respect to \r\nAfrican leaders and to engage with the African Union \r\nand African States on a mutual and respectful basis, as \r\nwe all share the same values of promoting the rule of \r\nlaw and fighting impunity for the most serious crimes. \r\nIt should be borne in mind that, of the 122 countries \r\nthat are States parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC, \r\n34 are African States. Africa is thus the continent with \r\nthe highest number of members. Indeed, that significant \r\nnumber should not be alienated.\r\nAs a signatory to the Rome Statute, Nigeria is \r\nfaithfully committed to the ideals of the ICC. Our stance \r\non human rights, the rule of law, peace and security, \r\ndemocracy, good governance and accountability is in \r\nline with the principles that the ICC was established \r\nto promote. We have been demonstrating our abiding \r\ncommitment to the promotion of these values in diverse \r\nways. Nigeria is a member of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute, which we ratified on \r\n27 September 2001. We are committed to the ICC and \r\nto the fundamental values of the Statute. We endorse \r\nthe guiding principles and objectives of the ICC, and we \r\nhave consistently underlined the structural importance \r\nof the ICC in the fight against impunity and the quest \r\nfor judicial accountability.\r\nWe believe that impunity must be addressed \r\nresolutely wherever it occurs in the world, and we \r\nhave instituted different instruments to address it \r\ndomestically. It is our belief that the aspiration to \r\na global system that bears on the rule of law, where \r\naccountability and social justice are the foundations \r\nof durable peace, should be a source of inspiration to \r\nall. Indeed, it should be a priority for the international \r\ncommunity, for world leaders and for citizens alike.\r\nMr. Kamau (Kenya): The report before us today \r\n(see A/69/321) is the tenth that we have received from \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), and we thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for it. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to recognize Judge Sang-Hyun Song, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court. Judge \r\nSong has without doubt presided over the ICC during \r\na most difficult and challenging period. During his \r\ntenure, the ICC has grown in both stature and reach. As \r\nthis will be his last attendance at the General Assembly \r\nas President of the Court, 1 would like to wish him on \r\nbehalf of the Republic of Kenya all the very best in his \r\nfuture endeavours.\r\nOver the years, we have continued to encourage \r\nthe ICC to expand its activities, to enhance its work, to \r\nimprove its efficiencies and to continue to deliver for the \r\nMember States and, more importantly, for the victims of \r\ncrimes within the ambit of its jurisdiction. We created \r\nthe Court because we believed that the international \r\ncommunity - by which we mean all countries, rich and \r\npoor alike - needed a common platform for the exercise \r\nof international jurisprudence. As President Uhuru \r\nKenyatta recently stated in his address to a joint sitting \r\nof the Senate and the National Assembly:\r\n“Given our experience, however, with the \r\nCourt, many have since asked why we acted with \r\nsuch enthusiasm [to join the Court.] It was because \r\nwe believed then, as we do now, that in an unequal \r\nworld, only a common set of rules governing \r\ninternational conduct could keep anarchy at bay.”\r\n26/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nThe Court was created to ensure that no country \r\nwould have a privileged relationship within it and that \r\nno individual would enjoy special privilege before it. \r\nAs with any young institution in its early years, we \r\ncontinued to engage, encourage and provide guidance \r\nto the Court in order to try to instruct it so as to keep \r\nit faithful to our objectives, to keep it aligned with \r\nthe Rome Statute, and to keep it focused on what we \r\nbelieved was the kind of future we wished to see in \r\nthe context of the work of international jurisprudence. \r\nAs we look at the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt that is before us today, we cannot help but \r\nfeel deep disappointment and a little let down by the \r\ninstitution for which we had such great expectations \r\nand aspirations.\r\nThe conclusion contained in the report tells a sad \r\nand disheartening story of low ambition, poor execution \r\nand little success. The Court says in the conclusion that\r\n“the activities of the International Criminal \r\nCourt continue to grow, with the first ever final \r\njudgement rendered and 8,040 victims represented \r\nin six cases at the trial preparation or trial stage \r\nof proceedings, which is more than ever before” \r\n(A/69/321, para. 98).\r\nIn a world that has been consumed by violent \r\nand astronomically devastating regional wars and \r\nclashes, and where hundreds of thousands — if not \r\nmillions — of people have died over the past 10 years, \r\nit seems extraordinary that the ICC has only one \r\njudgement to show for its years of existence and a \r\nvictims’ footprint of only 8,040. The ICC has registered \r\nin its report a rather anaemic, underachieving account \r\nof itself to Member States. That to us is simply \r\nconfounding. It is also truly depressing to imagine that \r\nthe Court would stand before Member States and state \r\nin its most recent report that it has finalized only one \r\njudgement and rendered representation for only 8,040 \r\nvictims. \r\nClearly something is deeply wrong. It comes as \r\nno surprise, therefore, that the conclusion contained \r\nin the same report also states for the first time ever \r\nthat no new State had ratified the Rome Statute during \r\nthe latest reporting period. Clearly, the Court, which \r\ncontinues to enjoy membership from one segment of \r\ncountries of the world, is having difficulties convincing \r\nnew countries that are not signatories to the Court to \r\njoin it and enhance its international reputation and \r\nwork.\r\nFor those of us who have interacted with the \r\nCourt intimately over the past few years, it is clear \r\nthat something radical and urgent must be done if the \r\nCourt is to stand any chance of long-term survival as \r\na viable and credible international institution. Kenya \r\nremains deeply concerned by the current interpretation \r\nand implementation of the Rome Statute, and for us this \r\nmay very well be the undoing of the Court. While the \r\nICC endeavours to carry out its mandate and continues \r\nto receive earnest cooperation from States parties, it \r\nmay appear that in the present state of interpretation \r\nand implementation, the ideals of the Rome Statute - \r\nnamely, punishment for serious crimes, fighting \r\nimpunity, national healing, and reconciliation and \r\nreparations for victims - may actually be achievable. \r\nA cursory look and superficial reading of the annual \r\nreport may even lead one to believe that success is \r\nindeed at hand. However, our delegation believes that \r\nthe current interpretation and implementation of the \r\nRome Statute are counterproductive and antagonistic \r\nto the very ideals contained in the Rome Statute.\r\nKenya, as a situation country, continues to be \r\npainfully aware of the manner in which the ICC operates \r\nand the interpretation it gives to the Rome Statute. \r\nAfter six years as a situation country and one entire \r\nelection cycle later, we are beginning to recognize \r\nthat the manner in which the ICC and the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor operate can be severely disruptive and \r\neven detrimental to the process of political and social \r\nprogress, healing and the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity. The Kenyan population has a deep desire \r\nto proceed with matters of social reconciliation and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is therefore deeply regretted that the ICC \r\ncontinues to be a hindrance and a stumbling block for \r\nthat aspiration of the Kenyan people. Surely, this cannot \r\nbe why we created the International Criminal Court. \r\nOur continued silence and acceptance of the status \r\nquo, therefore, will only undermine the legitimacy of \r\nthe Court and its core mandate, including the fight \r\nagainst impunity. It also does a great disservice to the \r\nvictims in whose name the proceedings continue to be \r\nperpetuated, not to mention that it violates the rights of \r\nthe accused as protected by the Rome Statute.\r\nOne of the first things that the Court must do to \r\nmend its ways is to unshackle itself from a pernicious \r\ngroup of countries that have hijacked its operational \r\nmandate and created a distorted institution that now \r\nrepresents the moral, ethical and, most disturbingly, \r\n14-59737 27/28\r\n30/10/2014 A/69/PV.34\r\npolitical values of a group of countries. The agenda \r\nof that group of countries seems to us to represent a \r\nvery shameless, disruptive and unrelenting pursuit. \r\nThis is witnessed in the working groups of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties here in New York and at \r\nThe Hague. It is also witnessed in the recruitment and \r\noperational practices of the Court. It is witnessed in its \r\njudicial and prosecutorial behaviour, and even in the \r\ngroup’s insidious manipulation of third-party actors, \r\nparticularly civil society organizations, as interlocutors \r\nof the Court.\r\nThe wealth and power that have given that group of \r\ncountries their arrogance to lay claim to the high ground \r\nof international action is well known. But what is also \r\nwell known is the genesis of that wealth, mostly born of \r\nimperialists and colonial adventure, tax and financial \r\nhavens, and a dogged proprietorship over intellectual \r\nproperty in a manner that denies other countries the \r\ntechnology they need for their own development. \r\nIndeed, there exists a similar proprietorship that this \r\ncabal of countries exercises over the ICC. That is \r\ndriven by those who think that because they fund a \r\ndisproportionately larger amount of the budget for the \r\noperations and, I might add, digressions of the ICC, \r\nthat therefore they have an inherent right to lay claim to \r\na special relationship with the ICC, including its staff, \r\nprosecutor and judges. But what we say is that money, \r\nlike might, does not necessarily make right.\r\nI know that I have digressed, but I did so only to \r\nmake a single point. The point is that the ICC is failing \r\nus because in its leadership, in its core professional \r\nstaffing, in its financing and in its operations it seeks to \r\nrepresent an ethos, morality, values and jurisprudential \r\nparadigm that represents one segment of the Assembly \r\nStates of Parties.\r\nThe ICC was created as an international institution \r\nthat was intended to work for all the signatory \r\nmember States, irrespective of size, wealth or political \r\ndispensation. But what we have witnessed in the Court \r\nover the past five years, in particular, is seriously \r\ndisturbing. The Court seems more interested in quasi-\r\njudicial theatre that is not in pursuit of justice and the \r\nfight against impunity, or in supplicant service to its \r\nbroad membership, but rather seems to be driven by \r\nthe parochial issues and political objectives of a small \r\ngroup of member States.\r\nIn paragraph 64, the report states that “the Rome \r\nStatute was never intended to replace national courts”. \r\nWhile that is true, we also know that the Rome \r\nStatute is not only about complementarity. Beyond \r\ncomplementarity, no attempt is made in the report to \r\ngive member States the benefit of the Court’s experience \r\nin implementing the Rome Statute. Yet we all know that \r\nit is the judicious, impartial application of the Rome \r\nStatute that the Court seems to be unable to muster.\r\nWhen we, the member States, were forming the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, we were convinced that \r\nwe were setting up a Court with higher standards of \r\npractice and procedures than those found in our national \r\njurisdictions. However, today we find ourselves saddled \r\nwith a Court that has lower thresholds and standards \r\nthan those found in our national courts. That is simply \r\nunacceptable. We therefore believe that the Rome \r\nStatute is undergoing a test of veracity, relevance and \r\nimpartiality, both in its application and in its value, and \r\nwe therefore urge member States, for the sake of the \r\nCourt itself, to revisit the Rome Statute and re-examine \r\nits interpretation and implementation.\r\nThe report we have in front of us, as we said earlier, \r\nis a sad litany of low ambition and obfuscation, couched \r\nin professional non-statements. Paragraphs 2 through 84 \r\nof the report leave us none the wiser on the experience \r\nof the Court. None of the organizational realities and \r\nchallenges that the Court has faced in implementing \r\nits mandate, including its singular, myopic obsession \r\nwith African situations, is contained in that report. It \r\nlacks analysis and perspective. The report is a lame \r\naccounting of what is in fact an institutional failure \r\nof historical proportions. It is a heartbreaking account \r\nin which the aspirations of millions of people and the \r\ninvestment of time and tens of millions of dollars from \r\nStates parties have no correlation whatsoever with the \r\noutcomes that can be enjoyed and celebrated by the ICC \r\nmembership, and indeed by the world at large.\r\nWere it not for the fact that the noble objectives of \r\ninternational rule of law and the historical imperative \r\nof our time to fight impunity were such a pressing, \r\nurgent and necessary requirement for international \r\npeace and security, it would also be our historical duty \r\nto put the ICC to rest, thus save it from further self-\r\ninflicted misery and the international community tens \r\nof millions of dollars, while sparing the long-suffering \r\nvictims the pangs of false hope and empty promises.\r\nThe President: The representative of the Sudan \r\nhas asked to speak in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nMay I remind members that statements in the exercise \r\nof the right of reply are limited to ten minutes for the \r\nfirst intervention, and five minutes for the second \r\n28/28 14-59737\r\nA/69/PV.34 30/10/2014\r\nintervention. Statements should be made by the \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Saeed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My delegation \r\nwould like to exercise its right to reply regarding \r\nthe request in the statement of delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Sweden on behalf of the Nordic \r\ncountries that the Government of the Sudan cooperate \r\nwith the International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nThe Nordic countries would appear to be acting in a \r\nspirit of confidence and trusteeship. They have imposed \r\nthemselves as spokespersons for the International \r\nCriminal Court. They seem to believe that they are \r\ngoing to implement international justice. They should \r\nconcentrate on their own issues and internal challenges, \r\nand not give us lessons about international justice when \r\nit is related to Africa even as they turn a blind eye to \r\nwhat happens in other countries of the world. They \r\nremain silent about such situations because countries \r\nthat violate international justice believe themselves to \r\nbe above justice and the rule of law.\r\nThe Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute, and \r\nwe are not concerned with the ICC’s verdicts. We have \r\nno commitment to the ICC regarding the 1969 Vienna \r\nConvention on the Law of Treaties. The practice of \r\nthe ICC has nothing to do with justice. The ICC has \r\nbecome a tool of international conflict and politics. \r\nThe representation of the Court in the Security Council \r\nref lects a double standard. A decision by the Security \r\nCouncil to refer a certain country to the ICC is the \r\nvery same decision that pre-empts other citizens from \r\nreaching the ICC. That is a double standard. It is mere \r\npoliticization.\r\nThe ICC is not international, because it seems to \r\nbe only a court for Africans. It targets Africa’s leaders \r\nand countries while it overlooks what is happening in \r\nother parts of the world. That has been our experience \r\nwith the ICC to date. Domestic legal institutions \r\nare concerned with fighting impunity, which is one \r\npurpose of international justice. We all agree that such \r\na principle should be implemented without double \r\nstandards.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
