"*1460057*\r\n14-60057 (E)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Rambally \r\n(Saint Lucia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 86\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (А/69/255)\r\nDraft resolution (A/69/L.7)\r\nThe Acting President: I invite Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency, to introduce the report of the Agency for the \r\nyear 2013.\r\nMr. Amano (International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency): There have been important developments in \r\nmany areas of the activities of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) since I last addressed the \r\nGeneral Assembly, a year ago (see A/68/PV.43). I will \r\nhighlight some of them very briefly.\r\nThe nations of the world are now considering new \r\nsustainable development goals for the years after 2015. \r\nI believe that nuclear science and technology have \r\nmuch to contribute to sustainable development in areas \r\nsuch as human health, agriculture, water management, \r\nindustrial applications and energy. I ask all Member \r\nStates to help ensure that the importance of science and \r\ntechnology is explicitly recognized as a central part of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe IAEA Technical Cooperation Programme plays \r\na key role in ensuring that developing countries gain \r\naccess to nuclear science and technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. The impact of our work on the daily lives of \r\nmillions of people around the world is extraordinary \r\nand deserves to be better known. For example, food \r\nirradiation helps to keep food fresh longer and protect \r\nit against parasites. That process does not impair \r\nfood quality and enables growers and producers in \r\ndeveloping countries to increase food exports. The \r\nIAEA ensures the availability of techniques such as \r\nisotope ratio analysis to help determine the authenticity \r\nof foodstuffs, including wine and honey. That also \r\nhelps in combating the growing world-wide fraud in \r\nfoodstuffs, while protecting legitimate producers and \r\nensuring food safety.\r\nCancer control in developing countries remains a \r\nhigh priority. This year, the IAEA helped Uruguay’s \r\nUniversity Hospital to acquire a linear accelerator so \r\nas to be able to provide radiotherapy treatment for \r\ncancer patients. Our Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy works with partners such as the World Health \r\nOrganization to save thousands of lives in developing \r\ncountries by helping them establish comprehensive \r\ncancer control programmes. This year, for example, an \r\nIAEA mission to Fiji identified the need for a national \r\nprogramme incorporating cancer prevention, early \r\ndetection and treatment linked to follow-up care.\r\nLast month, I announced that the Agency will \r\nprovide specialized diagnostic equipment to help Sierra \r\nLeone in combating the Ebola virus disease. Similar \r\nsupport is planned for other affected countries - \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.37\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n37th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 3 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

It will help those \r\ncountries to diagnose the disease quickly — within a \r\nfew hours, in fact — rather than the days it can take \r\nusing other techniques. Diagnosis is made using a \r\nnuclear-derived technology, known as RT-PCR. Early \r\ndiagnosis, if combined with appropriate medical care, \r\nwill increase patients’ chances of survival. It can also \r\nhelp to curtail the spread of the disease by making it \r\npossible to isolate and treat patients earlier. That is the \r\nlatest example of our work to make modern diagnostic \r\ntechniques available on the ground, where and when \r\nthey are needed.\r\nA key element of the IAEA’s special contribution to \r\ndevelopment is our unique cluster of nuclear applications \r\nlaboratories near Vienna. They offer training in nuclear \r\napplications to member States’ scientists, support \r\nresearch in human health, food and other areas, and \r\nprovide analytical services to national laboratories. \r\nI have previously reported to the General Assembly \r\nabout my plans to modernize the laboratories, which \r\nare more than 50 years old. I am pleased to inform the \r\nAssembly that the ground-breaking ceremony took \r\nplace in September. When that important project is \r\ncompleted in 2017, we will have modern laboratories \r\nthat will meet member States’ needs for decades to \r\ncome.\r\nIn September, we also marked the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Nuclear \r\nTechniques in Food and Agriculture. That unique \r\npartnership has helped many developing countries \r\nto feed their growing populations and generated \r\nconsiderable socioeconomic benefits.\r\nA key challenge facing the world in the coming \r\ndecades will be to provide reliable supplies of energy \r\nas the population grows, while at the same time \r\nlimiting greenhouse gas emissions. Many countries \r\nbelieve that nuclear power can help them in addressing \r\nthe challenge. Nuclear power is one of the lowest \r\nemitters of carbon dioxide, alongside hydro- and \r\nwind-based electricity, when emissions are considered \r\nthroughout their entire life cycle. Today, there are \r\n437 operational nuclear power reactors in 30 countries, \r\nproducing about 11 per cent of the world’s electricity. In \r\naddition, 72 reactors are under construction, mostly in \r\nAsia. Our latest projections show continuous growth in \r\nthe use of nuclear power to 2030.\r\nThis year, the IAEA Scientific Forum, held in \r\nSeptember, focused on the management and disposal \r\nof radioactive waste. That is an issue affecting all \r\ncountries, not just those with nuclear power programmes. \r\nRadioactive sources are widely used in industry and \r\nmedicine and in many other areas, and those sources \r\nmust be safely disposed of at the end of their working \r\nlife. Waste disposal must be given proper consideration \r\nby all States when embarking on any use of nuclear \r\ntechnology. There are widespread misperceptions about \r\nthe feasibility of the disposal of radioactive waste. In \r\nfact, well-established technologies exist to address the \r\nissue and are already in use.\r\nProgress continues in efforts to improve nuclear \r\nsafety. I have seen concrete improvements in safety \r\nfeatures at every nuclear power plant that I have \r\nvisited since the Fukushima Daiichi accident. In the \r\nimmediate aftermath of that accident, the focus was on \r\nhelping Japan respond to the crisis and ensuring that \r\nthe necessary lessons were learned and acted upon, \r\neverywhere. Next year, we will publish an important \r\nreport on the accident.\r\nHowever, nuclear safety is not simply about \r\nguarding against severe natural hazards. While taking \r\nforward the lessons learned arising from Fukushima \r\nDaiichi, I believe that it is time to start considering a \r\nbroader approach to strengthening nuclear safety. In \r\nthe coming years, we need to look at the safety aspects \r\nof other important issues, including decommissioning \r\nold facilities and extending the operating life of nuclear \r\npower plants, always keeping as our vision the goal laid \r\ndown in our Statute, namely, the “protection of health \r\nand minimization of danger to life and property”.\r\nThe central role of the Agency in helping to \r\nstrengthen the global nuclear security framework is \r\nwidely recognized. With its broad mandate, technical \r\ncapabilities and the support of 162 member States, the \r\nAgency is well placed to help the world act in unison \r\nagainst the threat of nuclear terrorism. \r\nThe most important area of unfinished business \r\nin nuclear security remains the entry into force of the \r\n2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material. There has been real \r\nmomentum in recent years towards its entry into force, \r\nwhich is one of the most significant measures that \r\nthe world could adopt to strengthen nuclear security. \r\nI appeal to all countries that have not yet done so to \r\nadhere to the amendment. The next high-level IAEA \r\nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security will take \r\nplace in December 2016. It will provide an important \r\nopportunity to review the progress achieved and to map \r\nout our work for the future.\r\n14-60057 3/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nI will now turn to nuclear verification. Safeguards \r\nagreements are now in force with 181 States. However, \r\n12 non-nuclear-weapon States have yet to meet their \r\nobligations under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons to conclude a comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement with the Agency. For those States, \r\nwe cannot draw any safeguards conclusions. I urge all \r\nthose States to conclude comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreements as soon as possible. I am pleased to report \r\nthat the number of States with the additional protocol \r\nin force continues to rise. It now stands at 124. That \r\nis very encouraging, because the additional protocol is \r\nan essential tool for the Agency to be able to provide \r\ncredible assurance that there are no undeclared nuclear \r\nmaterials and activities in a country.\r\nThe nuclear programme of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea remains a matter of serious concern. I \r\ncall upon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\ncomply fully with its obligations, to cooperate promptly \r\nwith the IAEA and to resolve all outstanding issues, \r\nincluding those that have arisen during the five-year \r\nabsence of Agency inspectors from the country. The \r\nAgency will maintain its readiness to play an essential \r\nrole in verifying the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea’s nuclear programme.\r\nIn the case of Syria, the Assembly will recall that \r\nin May 2011, I reported that it was very likely that a \r\nbuilding destroyed at the Dayr al-Zour site in 2007 \r\nwas a nuclear reactor that should have been declared \r\nto the Agency. The Agency has not received any new \r\ninformation that would affect that assessment. I again \r\nurge Syria to cooperate fully with the Agency in \r\nconnection with unresolved issues related to the Dayr \r\nal-Zour site and other locations.\r\nThere have been important developments concerning \r\nsafeguards implementation in the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. In November 2013, the Agency and Iran agreed \r\nto cooperate further to resolve all present and past \r\nissues under a framework for cooperation. Iran has \r\nimplemented most of the practical measures agreed \r\nunder the safeguards agreement, but not all of them. \r\nSeparately, our Board of Governors authorized the \r\nAgency to undertake monitoring and verification in \r\nrelation to nuclear-related measures set out in the Joint \r\nPlan of Action agreed between the E3+3 and Iran in \r\n2013. That has meant a large additional workload for \r\nAgency staff. In fact, our verification effort in Iran has \r\ndoubled under the Joint Plan of Action.\r\nThe Agency continues to verify the non-diversion \r\nof nuclear material declared by Iran under its safeguards \r\nagreement. However, we are unable to provide credible \r\nassurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear \r\nmaterial and activities. The Agency can therefore not \r\nconclude that all nuclear material in Iran is being used \r\nin peaceful activities. In order to resolve all outstanding \r\nissues, it is very important that Iran should implement, \r\nin a timely manner, all practical measures agreed \r\nunder the framework for cooperation. I also ask Iran to \r\npropose new practical measures for the next step in our \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe Agency is likely to face tough budget \r\nconstraints for some years to come, reflecting the \r\nfinancial difficulties in many countries. In response, \r\nwe are doing everything possible to make prudent use \r\nof our limited resources and to ensure that we deliver \r\nmaximum benefit to our member States. At the same \r\ntime, demand for our services continues to grow, and \r\nit is not possible to meet those growing needs within \r\nexisting financial means. We must therefore strike a \r\ndelicate balance between the capacity of member States \r\nto contribute and member States’ needs, while seeking \r\nadditional sources of funding.\r\nFinally, let me note that I have continued my efforts \r\nto encourage well-qualified women to apply for senior \r\npositions in the Agency. The number of women in \r\nsenior positions has risen steadily since I took office \r\nnearly five years ago. However, more needs to be done. \r\nI urge member States to encourage suitably qualified \r\nwomen to apply for positions at the IAEA.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Director General \r\nfor his introduction of the report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Slovakia \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/69/L.7.\r\nMr. Ružička (Slovakia): First of all, I would like \r\nto thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\npresenting the annual report of the Agency for the \r\ncalendar year 2013 (see A/69/255). The document sets \r\nforth the achievements of the IAEA and the challenges \r\nit will face in the coming years. The report also \r\nillustrates the vital role played by the Agency in the \r\ndevelopment and transfer of nuclear technology for \r\npeaceful purposes and its contributions to strengthening \r\nthe global nuclear safety framework and the guarantees \r\nregarding the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.\r\n4/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nIn 2013, the IAEA’s activities were strengthened in \r\ntwo areas: nuclear science and nuclear technology. The \r\nAgency continues to play an important role in providing \r\ntechnical assistance to member States wishing to use \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. So far, more \r\nthan 124 member States have benefitted from Agency \r\nprogrammes for the analysis and planning of their \r\nnational energy systems. Through those programmes, \r\nmember States can meet their national development \r\npriorities in areas where nuclear technologies offer \r\nadvantages. The importance of nuclear science and \r\nnuclear technology is one of the key issues of the post-\r\n2015 sustainable development agenda as we seek to \r\nensure and promote sustainable development.\r\nThis year, at the end of September, the \r\nmodernization of the nuclear applications laboratories \r\nin Seibersdorf, Austria - known as the ReNuAL \r\nproject, for the Renovation of the Nuclear Applications \r\nLaboratories - was started and will contribute \r\nsignificantly to the development of nuclear science. \r\nSlovakia attaches great importance to the Agency’s \r\nprogrammes in the areas of nuclear science, technology \r\nand applications. We have continuously supported \r\nseveral projects for the promotion of the use of nuclear \r\ntechnologies, such as the African Union’s Pan African \r\nTsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign. \r\nThe modernization of radiation technology techniques \r\nin Slovakia through close collaboration with the IAEA \r\nDivision of Physical and Chemical Sciences is also \r\namong our priorities.\r\nAnother important pillar of the IAEA mandate is \r\nnuclear safety and security. The Agency continues to \r\nplay the central role in helping to strengthen global \r\nnuclear security. Its work in that area is detailed in \r\nthe Nuclear Security Report 2014 and the Director \r\nGeneral’s report on the implementation of the IAEA \r\nNuclear Security Plan 2010-2013.\r\nProgress continues. However, with 437 operational \r\nnuclear reactors and 70 nuclear reactors currently \r\nunder construction in the world and in the aftermath \r\nof the Fukushima Daiichi accident, the importance \r\nof establishing an effective global nuclear liability \r\nregime remains on the table. The Agency must take all \r\nmeasures necessary to prevent further accidents. It is a \r\nunique international organization with expertise in all \r\naspects of nuclear technology, and we are confident that \r\nthe Agency will continue its leading role in shaping a \r\nfuture world with safer nuclear technologies.\r\nIn fulfilling Slovakia’s responsibility as Chair of \r\nthe Board of Governors of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, I am pleased to introduce, under item \r\n86 of the agenda of the General Assembly, the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency”, contained in document A/69/L.7. On \r\nbehalf of the 69 sponsors listed in the document, I bring \r\nit to the attention of the Assembly. The few updates to \r\nlast year’s text are of a technical nature relating to dates \r\nand the list of the relevant resolutions and decisions \r\nadopted by the General Conference of the Agency at its \r\nfifty-eighth regular session.\r\nSimilarly to last year, the text takes note with \r\nappreciation of the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency. It also takes note of the resolutions \r\nadopted by the General Conference and reaffirms the \r\nstrong support of the General Assembly for the Agency’s \r\nindispensable role in encouraging and assisting the \r\ndevelopment and practical application of atomic energy \r\nfor peaceful uses, technology transfer to developing \r\ncountries and nuclear safety, verification and security. \r\nIt appeals to Member States to continue to support the \r\nactivities of the Agency.\r\nThe language of the draft resolution was approved \r\nby consensus after the consultations held in Vienna and \r\nNew York on 22 and 24 October, respectively. I would \r\nlike to express our sincere appreciation to Member \r\nStates for their constructive engagement during the \r\ninformal consultations.\r\nI now submit this text to the General Assembly \r\nfor its consideration. I sincerely hope that, as was the \r\ncase last year, the draft resolution will be adopted by \r\nconsensus, without a vote. It also remains open for \r\nfurther sponsors.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Mayr-Harting (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe candidate countries Turkey, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland, Serbia \r\nand Albania, the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia align themselves with this \r\nstatement.\r\nWe are pleased to support draft resolution A/69/L.7, \r\non the report of the International Atomic Energy \r\n14-60057 5/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nAgency (IAEA) (see A/69/255), which again reaffirms \r\nthe indispensable role played by the Agency with \r\nregard to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and \r\nin assisting the development and practical application \r\nof atomic energy for peaceful uses, as well as in \r\ntechnology transfer and in nuclear verification, safety \r\nand security.\r\nThe European Union is committed to effective \r\nmultilateral action against the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and attaches the utmost importance \r\nto universalizing the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We call on States that \r\nhave not yet done so to join the Treaty as non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States. Furthermore, the European Union is \r\nactively contributing to global efforts to seek a safer \r\nworld for all and to create the conditions for a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals \r\nof the NPT and in a way that promotes international \r\nstability and is based on the principle of undiminished \r\nsecurity for all. We underline the vital importance of \r\nnon-proliferation for achieving those goals.\r\nThe European Union is fully supportive of the action \r\nplan adopted at the 2010 NPT Review Conference \r\nand would like to reiterate its commitment to the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nother weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East, \r\nas agreed by the NPT States parties in a resolution on the \r\nMiddle East during the 1995 NPT Review Conference.\r\nWe therefore regret that the conference on the \r\nestablishment of such a zone, which was due to \r\ntake place in 2012, was postponed. The European \r\nUnion fully supports the ongoing preparations for a \r\nsuccessful conference, particularly the tireless efforts \r\nof its facilitator, Ambassador Laajava of Finland. The \r\nprogress achieved during the informal gatherings in \r\nSwitzerland has provided some grounds for hope. \r\nThe EU calls on all States in the region to urgently \r\nand proactively engage with the facilitator and the \r\nco-conveners with the aim of convening the conference \r\nas soon as possible on the basis of arrangements freely \r\narrived at by the States of the region.\r\nThe 2010 NPT Review Conference reaffirmed the \r\nrole of the International Atomic Energy Agency in \r\nverifying and ensuring States’ compliance with their \r\nsafeguards obligations. It stressed the importance \r\nof resolving all cases of non-compliance and the \r\nimportance of States parties responding resolutely and \r\neffectively in such cases.\r\nThe European Union is deeply concerned about the \r\nprotracted and serious challenges to the non-proliferation \r\nregime posed by the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, the Syrian Arab Republic and the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran. We note the important developments \r\nover the past year in the case of Iran. The EU would like \r\nto stress again that the Security Council, as the final \r\narbiter in matters of international peace and security, \r\nhas the mandate to take appropriate action in the event \r\nof non-compliance with NPT obligations, including \r\nsafeguards agreements.\r\nThe Agency’s system of safeguards is a fundamental \r\ncomponent of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and \r\nplays an indispensable role in the implementation of the \r\nNPT. The measures contained in the model additional \r\nprotocol form an integral part of the IAEA safeguards \r\nsystem. In the European Union’s view, comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements together with additional \r\nprotocols constitute the current IAEA verification \r\nstandard. The EU calls for the universalization of that \r\nstandard without delay.\r\nWe have firmly supported the continued evolution \r\nof safeguards towards a State-level concept, with a view \r\nto achieving the efficient and effective implementation \r\nof IAEA safeguards worldwide. The EU is grateful for \r\nthe wide support received from the IAEA member States \r\nfor the EU-sponsored resolution on strengthening the \r\neffectiveness and improving the efficiency of Agency \r\nsafeguards, at the recent IAEA General Conference.\r\nThe European Union attaches importance to \r\nensuring that the highest standards for nuclear safety \r\nare implemented and continuously improved in the \r\nEuropean Union and promoted internationally. In \r\nthat context, the Council of the European Union \r\nadopted a renewed directive to strengthen the safety \r\nframework for nuclear installations. The directive \r\nsets the objective of preventing accidents and, should \r\nthey occur, mitigating the consequences and avoiding \r\nearly and large radioactive releases. That objective \r\nwill apply to all new nuclear installations and will be \r\nused as a reference for the implementation of safety \r\nimprovements to existing nuclear installations. We look \r\nforward to the diplomatic conference next year, where \r\na similar enhancement to the Convention on Nuclear \r\nSafety will be discussed.\r\nIn the framework of its strategy to combat the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the \r\nEuropean Union actively supports Security Council \r\n6/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nresolutions 1540 (2004) and 1887 (2009), as well as other \r\ninternational initiatives, such as the Global Partnership \r\nagainst the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass \r\nDestruction, the Proliferation Security Initiative, \r\nthe Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, \r\nthe Global Threat Reduction Initiative and the \r\nNuclear Security Summits, which have contributed \r\nto strengthening nuclear security. Of €260 million \r\ndedicated to chemical, biological, radiological and \r\nnuclear (CBRN) risk mitigation worldwide, more than \r\n€100 million has been allocated to the EU’s regional \r\nCBRN Centres of Excellence initiative.\r\nThe EU strongly supports IAEA activities in the \r\narea of nuclear security and, together with its member \r\nStates, is among the main contributors to the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Fund, having provided about €40 million to \r\ndate, to the benefit of around 100 countries. We intend \r\nto continue to support the IAEA’s work and look forward \r\nto the next high-level IAEA International Conference \r\non Nuclear Security, to take place in December \r\n2016. Effective physical protection is of the utmost \r\nimportance to prevent nuclear material falling into \r\nthe hands of terrorists and proliferators and to protect \r\nnuclear facilities against malicious acts. We therefore \r\nurge all States that have not yet done so to become \r\nparty to the Convention on the Physical Protection of \r\nNuclear Material and its 2005 Amendment.\r\nFinally, the European Union attaches the utmost \r\nimportance to the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\nprogramme and to its role in the responsible development \r\nof peaceful applications of nuclear energy. We support \r\nboth the IAEA and cooperation with third countries in \r\nthat area with an amount totaling about €150 million \r\nper year. In further support to the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy, the EU has allocated €225 million for \r\nthe period 2014-2020 for promoting nuclear safety, \r\nradiation protection and the application of efficient \r\nand effective safeguards of nuclear material in third \r\ncountries.\r\nMr. Singh (India): My delegation would like to \r\nthank the Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) for preparing the Agency’s \r\nannual report for the year 2013 (see A/69/255).\r\nIndia is committed to harnessing the benefits \r\nof nuclear energy for electricity production while \r\naccording the highest priority to nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity. India will need to rapidly increase its energy \r\nproduction to meet the growing energy requirements \r\nfor achieving its development goals. Nuclear energy is \r\nan essential component of our energy basket.\r\nThis year marks several milestones for the Indian \r\natomic energy programme. Our Department of Atomic \r\nEnergy was established 60 years ago, in 1954. This year \r\nalso marks the golden jubilee of India’s first reprocessing \r\nplant, known as the Plutonium Plant, which was the \r\nfirst step in the second stage of our nuclear power \r\nprogramme, which uses plutonium-based fuel in fast \r\nbreeder reactors. This year we also marked the fortieth \r\nanniversary of the commissioning of ISOMED, India’s \r\nfirst gamma-radiation processing plant for sterilizing \r\nmedical products. It was set up at the Bhabha Atomic \r\nResearch Centre (BARC), in Mumbai, with the help of \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme and the \r\nIAEA.\r\nIn August, unit 5 of the Rajasthan atomic power \r\nstation achieved a record 765 days of continuous \r\noperation, the highest in the world for the past two \r\ndecades and the second highest in the entire history of \r\nnuclear power. The first unit of the Kudankulam nuclear \r\npower plant, which achieved its first criticality in July \r\nlast year, is now operating at close to its full rated \r\npower of 1,000 megawatts electric. The second unit is \r\nin an advanced stage of commissioning. Construction \r\nof a 500-megawatt prototype fast breeder reactor is \r\nnearing completion at Kalpakkam, with the erection of \r\nall critical permanent in-core components completed. \r\nThe reactor is expected to achieve first criticality about \r\nsix months from now.\r\nIndia continues to attach high priority to research \r\nand development on all aspects of thorium-related \r\nreactor technologies and allied fuel cycles. The process \r\nof selecting a site for constructing an advanced heavy-\r\nwater reactor (AHWR) is at an advanced stage. Several \r\nIndian fuel-cycle facilities reached their highest \r\nperformance levels last year, with our pressurized \r\nheavy-water reactor fuel production achieving an \r\nincrease of 18 per cent over the previous year. Our \r\nhighest-ever production of heavy water was achieved \r\nwith our lowest specific energy consumption. With \r\nits excellent physical and nuclear properties, thorium \r\nis widely and rightly viewed as a fuel of the future, \r\nand India is continuing its intensive development \r\nof technologies based on the thorium fuel cycle for \r\ndemonstration in its AHWR programme.\r\nAn additional protocol to the agreement between \r\nIndia and the IAEA for the application of safeguards to \r\n14-60057 7/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nIndian civilian nuclear facilities entered into force on \r\n25 July 2014. India is committed to implementing the \r\nhighest standards for the safety of Indian nuclear power \r\nplants and the associated fuel-cycle facilities.\r\nWe will continue to participate in and assist the \r\nefforts of the IAEA Secretariat to enhance nuclear \r\nsafety through the cluster of measures it has formulated \r\nin the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. The Agency \r\nhas an important role in allaying misapprehensions \r\namong the public and member States about the safety \r\nof nuclear power plants, taking into account current \r\nadvances in the relevant design and technology areas. \r\nDuring his visit to India in March 2013, the Director \r\nGeneral expressed his appreciation for the safety \r\nupgrades implemented in our Tarapur 1 and 2 reactors. \r\nWe would also like to encourage the IAEA to make \r\nconcerted efforts for the free f low among member States \r\nof the latest information, technology and equipment \r\npertaining to nuclear safety.\r\nAs part of India’s commitment to implementing \r\nthe highest standards of the safety of its nuclear power \r\nplants, several steps have been taken recently to \r\norganize peer reviews at the national and international \r\nlevels. A follow-up mission of the IAEA Operational \r\nSafety Review Team to units 3 and 4 of India’s Rajasthan \r\natomic power station took place from 3 to 7 February.\r\nIndia appreciates the significant progress made \r\nby the International Project on Innovative Nuclear \r\nReactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) over the years. \r\nThe INPRO methodology for assessing innovative \r\ntechnologies and fuel cycles provides an opportunity \r\nto develop acceptance criteria for new designs, among \r\nother things addressing innovative capabilities for \r\nenhanced safety.\r\nIndia is pleased to note that the Director General \r\norganized this year’s Scientific Forum on the important \r\ntopic of “Radioactive Waste: Meeting the Challenge”. \r\nIn that connection, India’s policy of employing a closed \r\nnuclear cycle not only ensures better utilization of \r\nnuclear fuel resources, it also greatly minimizes the \r\nquantity of nuclear waste. The 2014 Scientific Forum \r\nprovided an opportunity for countries to share their \r\nexperience in this important area, which will go a long \r\nway in allaying one of the major concerns of nuclear \r\nenergy.\r\nThe commissioning of the BARC Actinide \r\nSeparation Demonstration Facility at Tarapur has made \r\nIndia one of two advanced nuclear countries capable \r\nof demonstrating the separation of minor actinides \r\nfrom high-level waste. That approach could help to \r\nsubstantially reduce both the life of radioactive waste \r\nfrom around 1,000 years to about 300, and the volume \r\nof high-level waste requiring long-term storage. \r\nFurthermore, technology has also been developed and \r\ndemonstrated for the removal of highly radioactive \r\ncaesium-137 and its conversion to a vitrified pencil \r\nsource, usable for blood-irradiator and similar low-\r\ndose-rate radiation applications. The removal of \r\nactinides and caesium-137 addresses several technical \r\nissues on the storage of high-level waste in a cost-\r\neffective and sustainable manner.\r\nNuclear energy has a crucial role to play in \r\nachieving the objectives of India’s sustainable economic \r\ngrowth. At the same time, India is extensively engaged \r\nin the development of nuclear technologies in diverse \r\nfields extending beyond nuclear power, including \r\nisotope applications for improved crop varieties, crop \r\nprotection and post-harvest technologies, radioisotope \r\napplications for diagnostic and therapeutic uses in \r\nhealth care, and technologies for safe drinking water, \r\nindustry, and so on.\r\nIndia attaches great importance to the IAEA’s work \r\nin the fields of nuclear science. We contribute to those \r\nactivities through participation in technical meetings \r\nand coordinated research projects, and we also support \r\nthe IAEA’s nuclear fusion programme. The Agency’s \r\nprogramme and achievements in relation to nuclear \r\napplications in food and agriculture, human health and \r\nnutrition, water resource management, protection of the \r\nenvironment and industry make a valuable contribution \r\nto meeting the needs of developing countries. India \r\nhighly appreciates the IAEA’s efforts in cancer \r\nmanagement, in particular the Programme on Action \r\nfor Cancer Therapy. India will continue to support \r\nAgency activities in those areas, including by offering \r\nservices of experts and training fellows in reputable \r\ninstitutions in the country.\r\nThere is widespread recognition that the threat of \r\nnuclear terrorism is one of the pressing challenges facing \r\nthe international community. Responsible national \r\naction and effective international cooperation are \r\ntherefore required for strengthening nuclear security in \r\norder to prevent vulnerable nuclear material falling into \r\nthe hands of non-State actors. India has consistently \r\nsupported the IAEA’s important role in facilitating \r\nnational efforts to strengthen nuclear security and in \r\nfostering effective international cooperation.\r\n8/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nIndia has participated in the three Nuclear Security \r\nSummits held thus far. As part of implementation of \r\nthe arrangement with the IAEA concerning India’s \r\nvoluntary contribution to the Nuclear Security Fund, \r\nthe services of an Indian cost-free expert in information \r\nsecurity are being provided to the Department of \r\nNuclear Safety and Security of the IAEA.\r\nUniversal adherence to the Convention on the \r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and early \r\nentry into force of its 2005 Amendment would go a \r\nlong way to strengthening global efforts in the area \r\nof nuclear security. India is party to the Convention \r\nand is one of the countries that have ratified the 2005 \r\nAmendment. We appreciate the Agency’s efforts to \r\nbring the amendment into force and note the increase in \r\nthe number of States adhering to it. We encourage the \r\nAgency to continue its efforts to promote early entry \r\ninto force of the Amendment.\r\nWith these comments, we take note of the IAEA’s \r\nannual report for 2013. India supports the work of the \r\nIAEA and has co-sponsored draft resolution A/69/L.7 \r\non the report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank Director General Amano \r\nfor presenting the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (see A/69/255).\r\nIn the context of rising demand for energy and \r\nclimate change concerns, there should be no doubt \r\nthat nuclear energy is bound to play a significant rale \r\nin the development of many developing countries. As \r\nindicated in the latest annual report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), of the 72 nuclear \r\nreactors that are under construction at present, 48 are \r\nin Asia. According to the report, over 30 countries \r\nare considering a nuclear power programme or are \r\nintroducing nuclear power into their energy mix. We \r\nnote that many of them are developing countries.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, it is obvious that the \r\nIAEA, in carrying out its Statute mandate, now has \r\na special responsibility in the global management of \r\nthe increasing interest in the use of nuclear energy \r\nworldwide. Based on articles II and III of its Statute, the \r\nIAEA has primary responsibility for assisting member \r\nStates in research on, and development and practical \r\napplication of, nuclear energy for peaceful uses. That is \r\nnot to say that the IAEA’s other statutory mandates, in \r\nparticular on safeguards-related verification activities, \r\nare subordinate. However, we emphasize that the \r\ndesign and implementation of required safeguards \r\nmust comply with the rights of the parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \r\nand avoid hampering their economic or technological \r\ndevelopment. In this context, any efforts to enhance \r\nsafeguards implementation, such as those under \r\nconsideration in the Agency, need to ensure respect \r\nfor the rights and the national sovereignty of member \r\nStates.\r\nThe peaceful use of nuclear energy and its \r\nassociated technology is of great importance to the \r\nscientific, technological and economic development of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran. While fully committed \r\nto its legal obligations under the NPT and the \r\nrelevant comprehensive safeguards agreement, Iran is \r\ndetermined to exercise its full nuclear rights, including \r\nenrichment for peaceful purposes. That policy is based \r\non long-term planning to meet the growing energy \r\nneeds of my country. In that regard, Iran has made \r\nconsiderable investment in building necessary nuclear \r\ninfrastructure and has achieved significant progress in \r\nthe civilian application of nuclear science and energy \r\nin the medical, agricultural and industrial fields, The \r\nBushehr nuclear power plant is now being operated by \r\nIranian staff with the assistance of Russian specialists. \r\nNext year, Iranian operators will take over the full \r\ncontrol of the plant’s operation.\r\nCooperation with the IAEA has a central place \r\nin Iran’s nuclear policy. All nuclear activities and \r\nfacilities in Iran are under the IAEA’s safeguards. On \r\nmany occasions, as a voluntary confidence-building \r\nmeasure, Iran’s cooperation with the Agency has gone \r\nwell beyond its existing legal obligations arising from \r\nthe NPT and its safeguards agreement. As a result, the \r\nnon-diversion of declared nuclear material and facilities \r\nin Iran has always been verified and confirmed in all \r\nIAEA reports.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is committed to \r\ncontinuing its cooperation with the Agency. Since last \r\nyear, a new chapter of cooperation with the IAEA has \r\nbeen opened and significant progress has been made. \r\nIran has demonstrated its political will to continue \r\na constructive approach in order to resolve all past \r\nand present issues. It is worth mentioning that Iran \r\nhas not recognized the so-called possible military \r\ndimensions of its nuclear programme, and indeed, the \r\nframework for cooperation agreed between Iran and \r\nIAEA does not make reference to any such irrelevant \r\n14-60057 9/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nnotions. There have never been any authenticated \r\ndocuments supporting possible military dimensions \r\nclaims, and, as was underlined by the former Director \r\nGeneral in his reports — for example, in document \r\nGOV/2009/55 — the Agency itself has limited means \r\nto independently validate the documentation that forms \r\nthe basis of such a claim.\r\nBased on our principled positions, we continue \r\nto cooperate with the IAEA on clarifying some of \r\nthe ambiguities. However, as stated by Iran’s high-\r\nranking officials, areas related to our national security, \r\nsuch as defence capabilities, are not subject to any \r\nkind of negotiation at any level. While the IAEA \r\nwork is basically of a technical nature, its operations \r\nundoubtedly take place in a political context. Therefore, \r\nobserving full impartiality in conducting the technical \r\nmandate of the IAEA is essential for preserving its \r\nauthority and credibility and member States’ trust.\r\nThe inalienable right of NPT parties to develop \r\nresearch, production and use of nuclear energy, \r\nincluding a national nuclear fuel cycle for peaceful \r\npurposes, must be respected by all. Some have tried to \r\ncreate doubts regarding the commitment of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran to nuclear non-proliferation. To prove \r\nthem wrong, in the past 15 months, we have engaged in \r\nserious negotiations in good faith with our interlocutors \r\nin the permanent five plus one group (P5+1) to help \r\nbuild confidence regarding Iran’s peaceful nuclear \r\nprogramme.\r\nWe believe that the differences over Iran’s peaceful \r\nnuclear programme can be resolved only through \r\nnegotiations. Those who may consider any other way out \r\nare either seriously mistaken or have a vested interest \r\nin furthering the schemes of the warmongers, who seek \r\nto create further difficulties for our region and beyond. \r\nWe are determined to continue negotiations with our \r\ninterlocutors in the P5+1 based on mutual respect \r\nand aimed at allaying the concerns of both sides. A \r\nmutually agreed solution is attainable if the facts and \r\nrealities of Iran’s nuclear programme are duly taken \r\ninto account and excessive demands were abandoned. \r\nA comprehensive agreement would be beneficial to all \r\nsides.\r\nMr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe Russian delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation to the Director General of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nfor introducing the report on the Agency’s work (see \r\nA/69/255). We commend the IAEA for its work and \r\nadvocate further strengthening of the Agency’s capacity \r\nand increasing our cooperation with it.\r\nOur country fully shares the high assessment of the \r\nAgency’s work. We hope that the IAEA will continue step \r\nup its efforts to develop nuclear energy and technology \r\nthroughout the world and expand international \r\ncooperation in the those fields, while improving and \r\nstrengthening the global non-proliferation regime. \r\nRussia intends to continue to develop nuclear energy \r\nand to contribute to its development throughout the \r\nworld.\r\nThe IAEA plays a fundamental role in the field of \r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Its unique \r\nverification mechanism enables it to very effectively \r\nmonitor States’ compliance with their obligations under \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). Our country has consistently championed the \r\nimprovement of the Agency’s monitoring functions, \r\nincluding adoption of the additional protocol to the \r\nIAEA safeguards agreement as a universally recognized \r\nnorm for verification in the area of non-proliferation. \r\nAn impartial approach to nuclear verification based \r\non objective indicators is an important element in \r\npreserving the legitimacy of the IAEA safeguards \r\nsystem and the non-proliferation regime as a whole.\r\nRussia actively participates in IAEA activities \r\nas a financial donor, including through voluntary \r\ncontributions to the International Project on Innovative \r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles and to the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Fund. We support the Agency’s efforts \r\nin technical cooperation and provide appropriate \r\nassistance to developing States.\r\nIn the context of the large-scale development of \r\nnuclear energy, the Russian Federation gives priority \r\nattention to such issues as creating a new architecture \r\nfor peaceful nuclear cooperation based on multilateral \r\napproaches to the nuclear fuel cycle, the guaranteed \r\nprovision of services in the field of the nuclear fuel \r\ncycle and resolving the problem of spent nuclear fuel \r\nand radioactive waste management. Based on those \r\npriorities, Russia has proposed an initiative on the \r\ndevelopment of a global nuclear energy infrastructure \r\nand the creation of international centres for the provision \r\nof nuclear-fuel-cycle services in order to ensure \r\nthe universal access by all NPT States parties to the \r\nbenefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, as long \r\nas they are in compliance with their non-proliferation \r\nobligations.\r\n10/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nPractice has shown that this is a timely initiative. I \r\nnote that there is an international uranium enrichment \r\ncentre in Russia. All States developing nuclear energy \r\nand complying with their non-proliferation obligations \r\nhave been invited to participate in it.\r\nThe Russian Federation supports the Agency’s work \r\nand underlines its leading role in forging cooperation \r\namong States and exchange of experiences in the field \r\nof nuclear security. We stress that it is unacceptable for \r\nissues from the disarmament agenda to be artificially \r\nintroduced in nuclear security activities. A pledge of \r\nsuccess for the international community in this sensitive \r\nquestion is the broadest possible representation of \r\nStates in international legal mechanisms for nuclear \r\nsecurity: the Convention on the Physical Protection \r\nof Nuclear Material and its Amendment, and the \r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts of \r\nNuclear Terrorism. Russia has signed and ratified those \r\ndocuments. We call on States that have not yet done so \r\nto accelerate the completion of domestic procedures for \r\naccession to those important international instruments.\r\nAt the fifty-eighth session of the IAEA General \r\nConference, Russia called for the annual reports \r\nsubmitted to the United Nations General Assembly to be \r\nprepared through consultations among member States, \r\neliminating the practice of submitting documents \r\nthat have not been fully agreed upon to the governing \r\nbodies of the IAEA. The documents are a reflection \r\nof the collective opinions and assessments of all \r\nstakeholders, and that cannot be achieved without duly \r\ntaking their perspectives into account. We welcome the \r\nfact that in the course of those consultations in Vienna, \r\nmember States were able to reach a consensus decision \r\non the proposal put forth by Russia. We emphasize the \r\nimportance of collective efforts and close coordination \r\nbetween the IAEA Secretariat and the Agency’s member \r\nStates, including on preparation of the annual reports.\r\nThe Russian delegation supports draft resolution \r\nA/68/L.7, on the report of the IAEA, and we are \r\namong its sponsors. We stress the importance of the \r\nAgency’s work to achieve reliable energy supplies and \r\nto strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime.\r\nMr. Hashmi (Pakistan): We commend Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano, Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), for his leadership. We value the \r\nAgency’s role in promoting the key statutory objective \r\nof enhancing the contribution of atomic energy to \r\npeace, health and prosperity throughout the world. The \r\ndelegation of Pakistan is pleased to co-sponsor the draft \r\nresolution on the report of the IAEA (A/69/L.7).\r\nThe Agency projects that by 2030, the world’s \r\nnuclear power generation capacity is expected to grow \r\nby 17 per cent at least and by 94 per cent at most, despite \r\nthe justifiable public anxiety that arose in the wake of \r\nthe Fukushima incident. We share this assessment.\r\nIn the past five decades, Pakistan has sought \r\nto harness nuclear technology for our development \r\npriorities, in collaboration with the Agency. Pakistan \r\nhas also been one of the beneficiaries of the technical \r\ncooperation programme. Pakistan is facing a severe \r\nenergy deficit, as the industrial, agricultural and \r\nconsumer demand for electricity has increased with \r\nthe growing population. To meet that demand we are \r\ntapping into all sources - hydropower, solar and wind \r\npower and nuclear energy. According to Pakistan’s \r\nNuclear Energy Vision 2050, we envisage nuclear \r\npower generation of 40,000 megawatts.\r\nIn Pakistan, there are five operational nuclear \r\nfacilities, which include three nuclear power plants \r\nand two research reactors. The oldest of those was \r\ncommissioned in 1972. Besides those plants, two more, \r\nproducing 340 megawatts each, are expected to be \r\ncommissioned by 2016. We have experience spanning \r\nfour decades of safely operating nuclear power plants. \r\nAll nuclear power plants in Pakistan are under IAEA \r\nsafeguards.\r\nIn the health sector, 18 nuclear medicine and \r\noncology hospitals are providing diagnostics and \r\ntreatment to several hundred thousand patients each \r\nyear throughout the country. The Pakistan Atomic \r\nEnergy Commission has established educational and \r\ntraining programmes in radiation oncology, nuclear \r\nmedicine and medical physics. In that regard, we note \r\nwith appreciation the role played by the Agency during \r\n2013 in cancer control, mainly through integrated \r\nmissions in the context of the Programme on Action \r\nfor Cancer Therapy. In December 2013, an integrated \r\nmission came to Pakistan and visited several nuclear \r\nmedical hospitals in the public and private sectors. We \r\nhave now received the draft report of the mission and are \r\nin the process of implementing its recommendations.\r\nFor a country of over 180 million people, food \r\nsecurity is of critical importance. Over the past \r\n50 years, four agricultural centres have been engaged \r\nin a variety of research and development activities \r\naimed at producing higher yields and better quality \r\n14-60057 11/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nagricultural products. Research and development work \r\nin the physical sciences and engineering have also led us \r\nto make important gains in water-resource management \r\nand in the production of most of the radioisotopes \r\nrequired by the nuclear medical centres and the private \r\nsector.\r\nThe Agency’s partnership with the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations in \r\nassisting interested Member States on cutting-edge \r\nfood and agricultural issues, as well as in the areas of \r\npest control, plant breeding, genetics, soil and water \r\nmanagement, and environmental protection, as noted \r\nin the report, should not go unnoticed.\r\nPakistan is willing to offer expert services and \r\ntraining facilities to other countries, in collaboration \r\nwith the IAEA.\r\nOver the past decade, Pakistan’s nuclear regulatory \r\nmechanism has evolved into an effective system \r\nunderpinned by a robust infrastructure. The Pakistan \r\nNuclear Regulatory Authority has based its regulations \r\non the IAEA safety standards. The Authority also offers \r\nitself for independent peer reviews. An IAEA Integrated \r\nRegulatory Review Service mission of 25 experts from \r\n15 countries was conducted early this year.\r\nPakistan commends the leading role that the \r\nAgency has played in harmonizing and coordinating \r\nglobal efforts, in the wake of the Fukushima accident, \r\nto improve the nuclear safety of nuclear power plants. \r\nFollowing the Fukushima accident, Pakistan conducted \r\nsuccessful stress tests of our plants and put in place a \r\ncomprehensive framework for all our nuclear power \r\nplants, called the Fukushima Response Action Plan.\r\nPakistan has been an active participant in the \r\nNuclear Security Summit process. That process has \r\nbeen a vital catalyst for nuclear security. Pakistan \r\nattaches the highest importance to nuclear security, \r\nbecause it is directly linked to our national security. \r\nThe IAEA plays a central and leading role in the \r\ninternational nuclear security architecture, as well as \r\nin the Nuclear Security Summits’ post-2016 successor \r\narrangements.\r\nOver the years, Pakistan has worked closely \r\nwith the IAEA to strengthen nuclear security. We \r\nare implementing our Nuclear Security Action Plan \r\nin cooperation with the IAEA. Pakistan attaches the \r\nhighest importance to ensuring the safety and security \r\nof its nuclear programme. We have an unblemished \r\nrecord of running a safe, secure and safeguarded civil \r\nnuclear programme for the past 40 years.\r\nPakistan’s nuclear security is supported by five \r\npillars: a strong command and control system led \r\nby the National Command Authority, an integrated \r\nintelligence system, a rigorous regulatory regime, \r\na comprehensive export control regime, and active \r\ninternational cooperation. Our security regime covers \r\nphysical protection, material control and accounting, \r\nborder controls and radiological emergencies.\r\nPakistan has gained rich experience in the field \r\nof nuclear security. We have established a centre of \r\nexcellence that conducts specialized courses in nuclear \r\nsecurity, physical protection and personnel reliability. \r\nWe are ready to share our experiences, best practices \r\nand training facilities with other interested States in \r\nthe region and beyond. We have also deployed radiation \r\ndetection mechanisms at several exit and entry points \r\nto prevent illicit trafficking in radioactive and nuclear \r\nmaterials. Pakistan is voluntarily contributing to the \r\nIAEA information resources, including the Incident \r\nand Trafficking Database.\r\nPakistan recognizes the important role played by the \r\nIAEA verification regime. We have fully complied with \r\nour obligations pursuant to our safeguards agreements \r\nwith the IAEA. The implementation of the regulatory \r\naspects of the Agency is important in its own right, and \r\nsafeguards play a key role in that regard. At the same \r\ntime, the promotional activities of the Agency are of the \r\nhighest priority for developing nations. The equitable \r\nallocation of extrabudgetary resources is needed for \r\nboth the safeguards and the technical cooperation \r\nprogrammes of the Agency.\r\nPakistan believes in an equitable, non-discriminatory \r\nand criteria-based approach to advancing the universally \r\nshared goals of non-proliferation and the promotion \r\nof the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Pakistan is an \r\nactive and mainstream international partner. We are \r\nalso a State with advanced nuclear capabilities. We \r\nreiterate our call for the inclusion of Pakistan in the \r\nNuclear Suppliers Group.\r\nMs. AlGharabally (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nThe agenda item under consideration by the General \r\nAssembly is of great importance, given its close links \r\nto the principles for which the United Nations was \r\nestablished, especially the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, and its relevance to efforts to limit \r\n12/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nthe proliferation of the non-peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy.\r\nThe State of Kuwait, having studied the annual \r\nreport of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for 2013 (see A/69/255), welcomes that valuable \r\ndocument and expresses its sincere appreciation and \r\ngratitude to the Director General of the Agency and all \r\nof its staff for their vigorous efforts in promoting the \r\nrole of the Agency. Their efforts have enabled the work \r\nof the Agency in harnessing nuclear energy for peace, \r\nhealth and prosperity throughout the world to go from \r\nstrength to strength. \r\nThe State of Kuwait congratulates the Union of the \r\nComoros, the Republic of Djibouti, the Cooperative \r\nRepublic of Guyana and Vanuatu for acceding to \r\nmembership in the Agency, and we wish them every \r\nsuccess.\r\nThis year coincides with the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nKuwait’s accession to the IAEA. The State of Kuwait has \r\nsince then sought to cooperate closely with the Agency \r\nand to support all of its programmes and activities \r\nrelating to the development of the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy in the interests of States and in various \r\nfields of development. The demands of socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment around the world in the ensuing decades \r\nhas led to an inevitable increase in the demand for \r\nenergy. Since nuclear energy is a supplementary source \r\nand not a substitute for other sources of energy, it is an \r\noption whose use is defined by States’ national policies \r\nin accordance with their capacities and requirements. \r\nThe State of Kuwait participates effectively in and will \r\ncooperate with the various departments in the Agency in \r\ntheir efforts to assist States in the use of nuclear energy \r\nand in developing their capacities and the necessary \r\nnational institutions. Moreover, the State of Kuwait \r\ncooperates with the States of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil in the implementation of joint programmes for \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nSince acceding to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, Kuwait has sought, in constant \r\ncoordination with the IAEA Department of Technical \r\nCooperation, to establish national laboratories to \r\nmeasure the levels of isotopes in Kuwait’s soil and \r\nwater and to build our national capacities, given the \r\nimportance we ascribe to the training of personnel \r\nat the national level qualified in the safe use of \r\nradiological substances. Furthermore, Kuwait, based \r\non its commitment to working actively with the IAEA, \r\nseeks to coordinate and work with the Department of \r\nTechnical Cooperation within the common programme \r\nadopted in 2014. Six specialized national agencies \r\nand programmes have been working in various fields \r\nduring the 2014-2015 period, covering several activities \r\nand State institutions.\r\nKuwait attaches great importance to the \r\nestablishment of the Agency’s nuclear fuel bank, \r\nwhich seeks to provide member States with uranium \r\nfuel in the event of its commercial scarcity. Kuwait has \r\ngiven $10 million in support of that project and looks \r\nforward to the increasing role of the fuel bank as soon \r\nas possible. \r\nKuwait attaches the utmost importance to questions \r\nof validity for the safety and security of radiological \r\nsources and nuclear material and to the need to \r\nestablish and implement regulations that will tighten \r\ncontrols on and supervision of the movements of those \r\nsubstances.My country has studied the Agency’s report \r\nin that regard and has followed with great interest its \r\nIntegrated Nuclear Security Support Plans. A recent \r\nevent was the IAEA ministerial-level International \r\nConference on Nuclear Security, held in Vienna, in \r\nwhich Kuwait participated because of its commitment \r\nto follow international efforts to promote nuclear safety \r\nand security. The vital and important role of the Agency \r\nin preventing the military uses of nuclear energy and \r\nin securing peaceful uses cannot be ensured without \r\nconcerted international efforts.\r\nThe Middle East region will not achieve its \r\nobjectives of security and stability as long as Israel \r\nremains the sole State refusing to place its nuclear \r\ninstallations under the safeguards regime of the \r\nAgency. That refusal constitutes a fundamental \r\nimpediment to the conclusion of a universal treaty \r\nto limit nuclear proliferation and deeply disrupts \r\nefforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regime. In \r\naddition, the continuance of that abnormal situation \r\nserves as a motive for other States to seek to acquire \r\nnuclear weapons on the pretext that the international \r\ncommunity has been quite relaxed in dealing with \r\nStates that refuse to place their nuclear installations \r\nand reactors under international inspection. In view of \r\nthe Israeli intransigence, my delegation calls upon the \r\ninternational community to pressure Israel to accede \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons and to place all its nuclear installations under \r\nthe safeguards regime of the Agency.\r\nWe affirm the right of all States to acquire the \r\nnecessary technology and expertise for the peaceful \r\n14-60057 13/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nuses of nuclear energy, but we also seek to render the \r\nMiddle East, including the Gulf region, free of nuclear \r\nweapons and weapons of mass destruction. We therefore \r\nwelcome the statement in the Director General’s report \r\nregarding the efforts by the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nto implement a number of scientific measures in \r\naccordance with the cooperation framework agreed on \r\n11 November 2013 between the Agency and Iran. That \r\ncooperation seeks to build the confidence sought by the \r\ninternational community that adverse consequences \r\ncan be avoided in the future.\r\nWe should also like to affirm the need for a diplomatic \r\nsolution as the basis for any future approach to that \r\nprogramme. Therefore, my delegation encourages the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran to continue its transparent \r\ncooperation with the Agency and to answer the \r\nAgency’s inquiries so as to dispel doubts, fears and \r\nmisgivings about the nature of its nuclear programme \r\nand to deal with all outstanding issues and implement \r\nall items relevant to the requirements of the Agency and \r\nthe relevant international resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, I cannot but express my country’s \r\nhope that the international community will continue \r\nits support for the IAEA in its work for the full, \r\nnon-selective implementation of all treaties relevant \r\nto nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nMs. Lim Ming Jing (Singapore): Singapore thanks \r\nthe Director General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) for the Agency’s comprehensive annual \r\nreport (see A/69/255). Singapore has consistently \r\nsupported the three pillars of the IAEA’s work: safety \r\nand security, science and technology, and safeguards \r\nand verification. We are pleased to once again \r\nco-sponsor the draft resolution on the report of the \r\nIAEA (A/69/L.7).\r\nThe importance of the IAEA’s work cannot be \r\noverstated. Nuclear incidents or accidents, as well as acts \r\nof nuclear terrorism, have grave humanitarian impacts. \r\nThey can also cripple economies and compromise \r\nsecurity. An international framework agreement on \r\nnuclear security and safety is therefore crucial. The \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial, as the only legally binding undertaking in the \r\narea of the physical protection of nuclear material, helps \r\nto fulfil that purpose. Singapore formally deposited \r\nour instrument of accession to the Convention and our \r\ninstrument of acceptance of its 2005 Amendment on \r\n22 September. Singapore is committed to playing its \r\npart in the global effort to promote nuclear security. \r\nWe strongly encourage Member States that have not yet \r\ndone so to accede to the Convention and its Amendment.\r\nWe also note that not all IAEA member States \r\nare contracting parties to the Convention on Nuclear \r\nSafety. We strongly encourage all remaining member \r\nStates to become contracting parties, in particular \r\ncountries embarking on or already possessing a nuclear \r\npower programme. \r\nThe Sixth Review Meeting of the Contracting \r\nParties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety earlier \r\nthis year adopted important decisions to strengthen \r\nthe international nuclear safety framework. One such \r\ndecision was to convene a diplomatic conference to \r\ndiscuss the proposal by Switzerland to amend article \r\n18 of the Convention. Singapore strongly supports \r\nthe Swiss proposal, because the Fukushima Daiichi \r\nnuclear accident is a stark reminder of the importance \r\nof preventing off-site contamination in the event of \r\nnuclear accidents. We urge all contracting parties \r\nto do so as well. As we know, nuclear safety is of \r\nparamount importance and should not be undermined \r\nby commercial or other considerations.\r\nStrengthening nuclear safety is a long-term, \r\nongoing effort, and we cannot afford to be complacent. \r\nWe understand that the IAEA Secretariat intends to \r\nwind down the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety and \r\nmerge elements of it with its regular programmes. Even \r\nso, we hope the secretariat will continue to emphasize \r\nthe 12 items in the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety \r\nin its regular programmes. In that regard, we look \r\nforward to the publication of the IAEA’s comprehensive \r\nreport on the Fukushima nuclear accident.\r\nMy delegation firmly believes in the importance of \r\nstrengthening regional cooperation on nuclear issues. In \r\nSouth-East Asia, we have strengthened cooperation on \r\nnuclear safety by sharing radiation monitoring data and \r\ncollaborating on emergency preparedness and response \r\nthrough the platform of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations Network of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies \r\non Atomic Energy. We also participate actively in other \r\nrelevant multilateral and regional initiatives, including \r\nthe Container Security Initiative, the Proliferation \r\nSecurity Initiative, the Global Initiative to Combat \r\nNuclear Terrorism and the Asian Senior-level Talks on \r\nNon-Proliferation.\r\nWhile Singapore supports the right of all sovereign \r\nStates to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, that \r\n14/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nmust be carried out in accordance with the provisions \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT). Therefore, my delegation is concerned \r\nthat several countries still remain outside the ambit of \r\nthe NPT and calls upon those States to accede to the \r\nNPT as soon as possible. \r\nWe are encouraged by the positive developments on \r\nthe Iranian nuclear dossier in the past year, which may \r\naddress the international community’s concerns over \r\nthe nature of Iran’s nuclear programme. However, we \r\nnote that Iran has not fully implemented measures that \r\nwere agreed on in the third phase of the Framework of \r\nCooperation, nor has it responded to the IAEA’s request \r\nto propose new practical measures for the next phase. \r\nWe strongly encourage Iran to implement all agreed \r\nmeasures in good time, and we hope that an agreement \r\non the next set of practical measures will be reached \r\nsoon. \r\nIn addition, we urge the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to return to the NPT, to fully \r\ncomply with all relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand to cooperate promptly with the IAEA in the full \r\nand effective implementation of its comprehensive \r\nsafeguards obligations.\r\nMy delegation also notes that nuclear disarmament \r\nis one of the three pillars of the NPT. In that regard, \r\nSingapore strongly supports the establishment of nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zones as an important confidence-building \r\nmeasure, and we seek to preserve South-East Asia as a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons. We therefore call on the \r\nnuclear-weapon States to accede to the Protocol to the \r\nSoutheast Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty as \r\nearly as possible, and without reservations.\r\nFinally, my delegation welcomes the IAEA’s \r\nimportant contributions in developing innovative \r\nand peaceful applications for nuclear technology that \r\nhelp tackle serious global challenges, ranging from \r\nclimate change and food security to health. That area \r\nof the IAEA’s work, including its collaboration with the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization on using nuclear \r\ntechnology to improve food security, deserves more \r\nattention and support, especially in view of the current \r\nstrong emphasis on sustainable development and the \r\npost-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn that regard, Singapore has been a long-time \r\ncollaborator with the IAEA in providing technical \r\nassistance to other member States through scientific \r\nvisits, fellowship attachments and regional events \r\nin subjects ranging from nuclear medicine and \r\nradiotherapy to radiation protection. We also welcome \r\nthe establishment of the IAEA’s Ocean Acidification \r\nInternational Coordination Centre to address the \r\ngrowing problem of ocean acidification. Singapore \r\nwill continue to seek new areas of cooperation with the \r\nIAEA in order to provide relevant technical assistance \r\nto member States.\r\nI reaffirm Singapore’s continued support of the \r\nIAEA’s work.\r\nMr. Lazarev (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): First of \r\nall, on behalf of the delegation of Belarus I would like to \r\nthank the Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), Mr. Amano, for introducing \r\nthe report of the Agency for 2013 (see A/69/255).\r\nThe IAEA is continuing to duly carry out its \r\nimportant role in support of the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime based on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and in assisting member \r\nStates to realize their rights and fully enjoy the benefits \r\nof the peaceful use of nuclear energy. Belarus notes the \r\nimportance of not only further improving the Agency’s \r\nsafeguards system in order to increase its effectiveness, \r\nbut also ensuring member States’ confidence in the \r\nobjectivity of the existing system.\r\nThe IAEA’s annual report mentions the fact that \r\nin 2013 Belarus began building its first nuclear power \r\nplant and that it was the second country in the past \r\n30 years to do so. We would like to emphasize the \r\nstrict compliance of our country with international \r\nnorms and standards and the priority that we give to \r\nensuring nuclear safety, as well as our openness and \r\npreparedness for dialogue with interested countries and \r\ninternational organizations on the completion of the \r\nBelarusian nuclear power plant project. At the current \r\nstage of our national nuclear energy programme, which \r\nhas very great potential for practical use, we reaffirm \r\nour intention to use the services that the Agency offers \r\nto countries new to the development of nuclear energy, \r\nand we welcome advisory missions.\r\nBelarus emphasizes the importance of the Agency’s \r\ntechnical cooperation mechanisms and the need to \r\ncontinue and broaden such programmes at the IAEA. \r\nThe participation of the IAEA and other \r\ninternational organizations in multilateral efforts to \r\nrehabilitate and sustainably develop the areas that were \r\naffected by the Chernobyl disaster is still relevant. The \r\nrelevant regional technical cooperation projects with \r\n14-60057 15/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nthe Agency are making a significant contribution to \r\ninternational cooperation on Chernobyl. It is important \r\nthat, as that cooperation continues, the IAEA continues \r\nto coordinate its actions with other international \r\norganizations and donor countries that are involved in \r\ncooperation on Chernobyl.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to note that Belarus \r\nsupports draft resolution A/69/L.7, which takes note of \r\nthe report of the IAEA, and that Belarus is one of its \r\nsponsors.\r\nMr. Kibret (Ethiopia): I would like first and \r\nforemost to thank the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) for its comprehensive annual report \r\nfor 2013 (see A/69/255), which highlights the outcomes \r\nof the Agency’s wide-ranging and important activities \r\nconducted during the year. I would also like to express \r\nour appreciation for the continued commitment and \r\nleadership of the Director General of the IAEA, \r\nAmbassador Yukiya Amano, in the field of nuclear \r\nscience and technology and their applications for the \r\npeaceful use of nuclear energy. Under his leadership \r\nthe Agency continues to complement and encourage the \r\nefforts of member States in taking concrete measures to \r\npromote nuclear disarmament.\r\nEthiopia commends the IAEA for its ongoing \r\nefforts in discharging its responsibilities to help \r\nmember States use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes. We believe that the IAEA’s three pillars - \r\nnuclear technology and its application, nuclear safety \r\nand security, and nuclear verification and technical \r\ncooperation - will continue to play a key role as catalysts \r\nfor sustainable development by promoting peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy while minimizing the risk of \r\nnuclear proliferation. On the other hand, the IAEA’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme for the preservation \r\nand management of nuclear knowledge continues to be \r\na high priority for many member States. In that regard, \r\nthe development of nuclear power projects and the \r\npromotion of the application of nuclear technology to \r\nmedicine, particularly for human health, and to food \r\nand agriculture and the protection of the environment, \r\nare worth mentioning.\r\nWe are also of the view that both national measures \r\nand international cooperation are essential for \r\nnuclear and radiation safety. We would further like to \r\nemphasize that the Agency has a key role to play in \r\nthe promotion of a global security and safety culture. \r\nIn that regard, the Agency’s safeguards are believed \r\nto be basic components of the non-proliferation \r\nregime and to create an environment conducive to \r\npeaceful nuclear use and safety. Furthermore, the \r\ncollaborative efforts of member States, the IAEA, \r\nother treaty bodies, other international organizations \r\nand civil society in responding to the serious security \r\nthreats from non-State actors, particularly terrorists \r\nwho seek to acquire weapons of mass destruction, \r\nare critical. Similarly, the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1887 (2009) is also \r\nessential in addressing the challenges associated with \r\nthe prevention of the possession of nuclear and other \r\nrelated dangerous weapons by non-State entities.\r\nIn Ethiopia, the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\ncontinues to significantly support Government efforts \r\nto develop capabilities in the areas of the control \r\nof tsetse f lies, cancer treatment, diagnostic nuclear \r\nmedicine services, isotope hydrological analysis, \r\nnon-destructive quality testing and national nuclear \r\nscience and technology infrastructure. We have \r\nimproved our capacities through manpower training, \r\nequipment acquisition, expert missions and other forms \r\nof technical assistance from the IAEA.\r\nAs a signatory to a number of IAEA treaties and \r\nconventions, Ethiopia has always been supportive of \r\nthe Agency’s advocacy for the peaceful use of nuclear \r\ntechnology. We also firmly believe that sufficient and \r\npredictable resources for the Agency’s programmes \r\nand, more importantly, the balanced distribution \r\nof resources to the safeguards, nuclear safety and \r\ntechnical cooperation activities of the Agency need to \r\nbe ensured. The Technical Cooperation Programme is \r\nin fact playing a crucial role in the transfer of nuclear \r\ntechnology to developing countries like Ethiopia.\r\nOur biggest technical cooperation project with the \r\nIAEA is aimed at eradicating the tsetse f ly from the \r\nSouthern Rift Valley region. The wide-ranging nature \r\nof the disease still poses a serious threat to the lives and \r\nlivelihoods of our communities and is also a significant \r\nconstraint to increasing livestock production in \r\nEthiopia. However, the tsetse f ly eradication project that \r\nis currently under way has enabled us to make notable \r\nprogress in addressing this deadly cattle disease. As a \r\nresult, substantial numbers of communities have been \r\nbenefiting from the project through expansion of their \r\nfarmland and livestock-keeping. With the technical \r\nand financial assistance of the IAEA, an industrial \r\nirradiator was also installed and inaugurated, in July \r\n2014.\r\n16/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nWith regard to the Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy, Ethiopia commends the IAEA for its role \r\nand continued support in establishing comprehensive \r\ncancer-control programmes at Black Lion Specialized \r\nHospital, which serves all referral patients from all \r\nover the country. However, in view of the complex and \r\nchallenging nature of the disease of cancer, we wish \r\nto request the continued cooperation of the Agency in \r\nestablishing more radiotherapy and nuclear-medicine \r\nservices in five other university hospitals in Ethiopia.\r\nOn the other hand, the isotope hydrology laboratory \r\nsituated at Addis Ababa University is providing \r\ninvaluable services to postgraduate students and \r\nnational isotopic research workers. The university has \r\nalso been selected to host scientific visits and training \r\nfor fellows from Malawi and Lesotho. Currently, \r\nhowever, the laboratory is not yet in a position to carry \r\nout carbon-13 and carbon-14 analysis. We have thus \r\nsent samples to the IAEA and are waiting for the results \r\nto be sent back. Hence, we need the IAEA’s assistance \r\nto strengthen our national capacity by making the \r\nrequired facilities available to the laboratory.\r\nWe firmly believe that the provision of sufficient \r\nand predictable resources to the programmes of the \r\nAgency and, more importantly, the balanced distribution \r\nof resources to the safeguards, nuclear safety and \r\ntechnical cooperation activities of the Agency need to be \r\nensured. We are also of the opinion that the safeguards \r\nand verification aspects of the Agency vividly illustrate \r\nthe importance of the Agency’s continued vigilance and \r\ncontributions to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Similarly, Ethiopia strongly supports the \r\nright of all States to have full use of nuclear technology \r\nand its scientific application in accordance with the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.\r\nWe recognize that the development of new nuclear \r\ntechnology has immense benefits that can promote the \r\nsocial and development agendas by supporting national \r\nendeavours. It is in that context that Ethiopia values \r\nthe role of the IAEA in the transfer and sharing of \r\ntechnology and experience as vital towards achieving \r\nsocioeconomic objectives and the goals of developing \r\ncountries such as Ethiopia. It is precisely for this and the \r\nother reasons mentioned earlier that we will continue to \r\nlook forward to further strengthening our cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA.\r\nFinally, Ethiopia, as in the past, is glad to continue \r\nto join the sponsor States of the draft resolution on the \r\nreport of the IAEA (A/69/L.7).\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report on the work \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\n(seeA/69/255), introduced by Director General Yukiya \r\nAmano.\r\nOver the past year, the IAEA has been diligently \r\nfulfilling its duties under its Statute and has made \r\ngreat efforts and substantial achievements in such \r\nareas as the peaceful use of nuclear energy and \r\ntechnology, strengthening nuclear safety and security, \r\nand promoting non-proliferation. China would like to \r\nacknowledge this fact.\r\nThis year marks the thirtieth anniversary of \r\nChina’s membership in the IAEA. During the past \r\n30 years, the Chinese Government has been developing \r\nnuclear energy in an efficient and safe manner under \r\nthe principle of placing equal emphasis on development \r\nand security. China and the IAEA have carried out \r\ncomprehensive cooperation at multiple levels in various \r\nareas, and that has contributed to the peaceful, broad \r\nand safe use of nuclear energy in China and around the \r\nworld. Recently, upon the convening of the fifty-eighth \r\nsession of the IAEA General Conference, Chinese \r\nPremier Li Kexiang sent a message of congratulations \r\ncommending the fruitful results of the cooperation \r\nbetween China and the IAEA.\r\nWe are glad to see that in today’s world the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear energy has maintained its \r\nmomentum. The application of nuclear technology is \r\nincreasingly broad and nuclear safeguards are applied \r\nto more facilities, with nuclear safety and security \r\nfurther strengthened as a result. More and more people \r\nare benefiting from this process.\r\nMeanwhile, international efforts for nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear security are still \r\nconfronted with challenges, and the risk of nuclear \r\nterrorism cannot be ignored. \r\nThe IAEA has a formidable task ahead of it. China \r\nhopes that the Agency will focus on the following \r\naspects in its future work.\r\nFirst, it should deepen cooperation in nuclear energy \r\nand technology. We encourage the IAEA to increase \r\ninput in this area, with a view to helping member \r\nStates meet their growing needs for the peaecful uses \r\nof nuclear energy. In particular, support and assistance \r\nshould be provided to the developing countries, so that \r\nthey may also enjoy the benefits derived from nuclear \r\n14-60057 17/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nenergy development. China is willing to share the \r\nresults and experience it has gained in this regard.\r\nSecondly, it should enhance nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity. With respect to nuclear safety, the Agency \r\nshould require the Japanese Government to expedite \r\nits efforts in dealing with the consequences of the \r\nFukushima nuclear accident, and assist it in doing so. \r\nThe Agency should also closely follow the progress \r\nmade, review the effects of work in that area and \r\nprovide updates to the international community in a \r\ntimely manner.\r\nConcerning nuclear security, with the prospect of \r\nthe Nuclear Security Summit process possibly ending \r\nin 2016, the Agency should fully prepare itself to play \r\na primary role in the area of nuclear security and make \r\ncontributions to the establishment of a fair, reasonable \r\nand win-win international security architecture.\r\nThirdly, the Agency should steadily improve its \r\nsafeguards regime. The application of its safeguards \r\nshould first and foremost be objective and impartial. \r\nIt is on this basis that efforts should be made to \r\nfurther enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nsafeguards regime. China welcomes the fact that the \r\nSecretariat has exchanged views with member States on \r\nthe State-level Safeguards Concept. China believes that \r\nadjustments to the safeguards measures should be made \r\nonly after full consultations among member States.\r\nFourthly, the Agency should objectively and \r\nimpartially deal with hot-spot issues. China encourages \r\nit to play a constructive role in settling regional nuclear \r\nissues peacefully through dialogue and consultations in \r\naccordance with its mandate. China will always support \r\nthe IAEA in its efforts to fully and effectively fulfil its \r\nduties mandated by the IAEA Statute and contribute to \r\nworld peace and development.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan): Let me begin by \r\nthanking Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), for \r\npresenting the IAEA’s annual report (see A/69/255). \r\nWe deeply appreciate the work of the Agency to further \r\npromote the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and ensure \r\nnon-proliferation through strengthening the IAEA \r\nsafeguards system. We commend Director General \r\nAmano for his leadership and the Secretariat for its \r\ntireless efforts to fulfil its mandate. We will continue \r\nto support their efforts as much as we can.\r\nThe Government of Japan also welcomes the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, the Republic of Djibouti, the \r\nCo-operative Republic of Guyana and the Republic of \r\nVanuatu as new members of the IAEA.\r\nThe Government of Japan would like to express its \r\ngratitude once again for the great support and assistance \r\nprovided by the international community for more \r\nthan three and a half years since the Great East Japan \r\nEarthquake and its resulting tsunamis and the accident \r\nat the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station of \r\nthe Tokyo Electric Power Company. Managing the \r\naftermath of the Fukushima Daiichi accident remains \r\nan important task for us.\r\nIn September last year, the Government of Japan \r\ndeveloped a basic policy for the fundamental resolution \r\nof the contaminated water issue and has been taking \r\nmeasures based on that policy in a step-by-step manner. \r\nThe Government formulated multilayered preventive \r\nplans to manage the issue. The entire Government \r\nis determined to continue working in an integrated \r\nmanner to solve the contaminated-water issue.\r\nThe dissemination of information to the international \r\ncommunity remains as crucial as its dissemination \r\nwithin Japan. We are striving to provide as much \r\ninformation as possible to the international community \r\nand to maintain transparency. For that purpose, we \r\nhave been publishing marine monitoring results on a \r\ndaily basis. Together with the updates regarding the \r\ndecommissioning process and the countermeasures \r\nfor contaminated water, comprehensive information is \r\nreported to the IAEA on a regular basis and made public \r\nthrough the IAEA’s website. Furthermore, we have \r\nassured food safety by strengthening administrative \r\nsystems. A report on the safety of fishery products, \r\ncovering all developments on the matter after the \r\naccident, was issued and made available to the \r\ninternational community in May.\r\nThe Government of Japan attaches great importance \r\nto the promotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, \r\none of the pillars of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons, and highly appreciates the \r\nAgency’s activities in non-power applications of nuclear \r\ntechnologies. Japan acknowledges with satisfaction that \r\ntangible outcomes have been achieved through Director \r\nGeneral Amano’s initiatives to promote the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear technology in the areas of human health \r\nand nutrition. They include cancer control through \r\nthe Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy and \r\ninitiatives in the areas of food and agriculture, water \r\nmanagement and the environment. Japan will continue \r\nto support that beneficial work.\r\n18/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nThe Renovation of the Nuclear Applications \r\nLaboratories Project of the IAEA is of benefit to all \r\nMember States. Japan would like to call upon all \r\nMember States to cooperate in supporting it. Japan \r\ncontributed €500,000 to it last year and is considering a \r\nfurther contribution.\r\nIt is our country’s responsibility to contribute to the \r\nimprovement of nuclear safety in the world. Japan is \r\ndetermined to further contribute to the strengthening \r\nof nuclear safety worldwide by sharing with the \r\ninternational community the experience and lessons \r\nlearned from the Fukushima Daiichi accident.\r\nThe Government of Japan attaches great importance \r\nto the steady implementation of the IAEA Action Plan \r\non Nuclear Safety, adopted in September 2011. As \r\npart of its implementation and in order to improve \r\nthe effectiveness of the international legal framework \r\n- one of the 12 main actions of the Action Plan - we \r\nexpressed our intention to conclude the Convention on \r\nSupplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage. \r\nWe strongly believe that doing so would contribute to \r\nthe establishment of a global framework for nuclear \r\nliability. Also, Japan will continue to actively cooperate \r\nwith the IAEA to formulate the IAEA Fukushima \r\nreport.\r\nJapan continuously contributes to improving \r\nnuclear security domestically and internationally. \r\nJapan deposited its instrument of acceptance of \r\nthe Amendment to the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material on 27 June. In addition, \r\nJapan will receive an IAEA International Physical \r\nProtection Advisory Service mission in February next \r\nyear. Japan has supported and continues to support the \r\nstrengthening of the effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nIAEA safeguards system. We continue to advocate the \r\nuniversalization of the additional protocol.\r\nNorth Korea’s continued nuclear and missile \r\ndevelopment is of grave concern not only to North-\r\nEast Asia, but to the whole international community. \r\nJapan once again hereby stresses that North Korea \r\nmust abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear \r\nprogrammes, including its uranium enrichment, in \r\na complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and \r\nmust immediately suspend all related activities. Japan \r\nstrongly urges North Korea to take concrete actions \r\ntowards denuclearization, to refrain from any further \r\nprovocative acts and to fully comply with the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and the 2005 Joint \r\nStatement of the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks. \r\nJapan fully supports the IAEA’s continued involvement \r\non that issue.\r\nWith regard to the Iranian nuclear issue, Japan \r\nfully supports the efforts by the E3+3 Governments \r\nin pursuit of a final and comprehensive resolution \r\nof the issue. Japan fully supports the IAEA’s role in \r\nthat matter, especially in verification and monitoring \r\nactivities for the purpose of ensuring the exclusively \r\npeaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme, as well \r\nas its efforts to resolve all outstanding issues, including \r\npossible military dimensions.\r\nIn conclusion, Japan expresses its firm determination \r\nto continue to conduct peaceful nuclear activities while \r\nensuring safeguards, non-proliferation, nuclear safety \r\nand nuclear security, and to contribute further to the \r\npromotion of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nMr. Al Musharakh (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to thank Mr. Yukiya \r\nAmano. The United Arab Emirates would also like \r\nto announce its support for and sponsorship of draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.7, on the report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (see A/69/255).\r\nThe United Arab Emirates recognizes the \r\nindispensable role of the IAEA in assisting Member \r\nStates in the transfer of nuclear knowledge for peaceful \r\nuses in all fields of nuclear applications and appreciates \r\nthe Agency’s role in supporting member countries’ \r\nnational needs and providing them with the necessary \r\ntechnical support. My country also recognizes the \r\nAgency’s efforts to ensure the credibility and efficiency \r\nof the safeguards system, as the full implementation of \r\nsafeguards and the commitment to non-proliferation \r\nare fundamental to the development of any nuclear \r\nprogramme.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates places great emphasis on \r\nnuclear safety. We have been committed to implementing \r\nthe IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. We continue \r\nto make significant progress in the development of a \r\npeaceful nuclear power programme. Early lessons \r\nlearned have been applied in the United Arab Emirates \r\nfollowing the accident at Japan’s Fukushima plant in \r\n2011. Quick action was taken with a comprehensive \r\nsafety assessment of the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant \r\nreactors currently under construction. My delegation \r\nlooks forward to benefiting from the IAEA Fukushima \r\nDaiichi lessons-learned report as soon as it is published.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates continues to support the \r\nAgency’s work through its participation in the IAEA \r\n14-60057 19/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nCommission on Nuclear Safety and through hosting \r\nseveral IAEA peer review missions to strengthen its \r\nnuclear safety infrastructure. Moreover, we encourage \r\nmember States to utilize peer reviews to strengthen \r\ntheir national nuclear infrastructure. Additionally, in \r\n2013 the United Arab Emirates signed an integrated \r\nwork plan with the Agency to coordinate the IAEA’s \r\ntechnical support to my country. The United Arab \r\nEmirates benefits from that support in various fields, \r\nincluding nuclear energy, health and agriculture, among \r\nothers.\r\nAlong with its great emphasis on international \r\ninstruments in the area of nuclear safety, the United \r\nArab Emirates, specifically Abu Dhabi, hosted the \r\nInternational Conference on the Safety and Security of \r\nRadioactive Sources in October 2013. That Conference \r\nmarked the 10-year anniversary of the Code of Conduct \r\non the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, and \r\nthe Conference highlighted significant progress made \r\nworldwide in implementing the provisions of the Code. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates has endorsed the Code of \r\nConduct and its Supplementary Guidance on the Import \r\nand Export of Radioactive Sources, and has submitted \r\nits national implementation report.\r\nIn the area of civil liability for nuclear damage, \r\nin 2012 the United Arab Emirates joined the 1997 \r\nProtocol to Amend the Vienna Convention on Civil \r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage and the Joint Protocol \r\nRelating to the Application of the Vienna Convention \r\nand Paris Convention. The United Arab Emirates has \r\nalso recently ratified the Convention on Supplementary \r\nCompensation for Nuclear Damage, based on its belief \r\nin the importance of establishing a national liability \r\nframework and a harmonized international liability \r\nregime.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates has adopted clear \r\npositions on disarmament and non-proliferation issues, \r\nbased on its firm belief in the importance of achieving \r\nthe objectives of international peace and security. \r\nMy country believes that the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy requires transparency and commitment with \r\nregard to the obligations of non-proliferation. That \r\nis why accession to, and the full implementation \r\nof, international agreements on disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation are of great importance. In that \r\nregard, we support the Agency’s efforts to ensure the \r\ncredibility and efficiency of the safeguards system, and \r\nwe call upon member States with pending nuclear files \r\nto cooperate with the Agency and permit verification of \r\ntheir peaceful programme and to eliminate any possible \r\nmilitary dimensions.\r\nThe failure to convene the conference on the \r\nestablishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction \r\nin 2012, which had been announced at the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, is a \r\ndisappointment to my country and to countries in \r\nthe region at large. We call for the holding of such a \r\nconference at an early date. The United Arab Emirates \r\nwill continue to support and engage in various \r\nconsultations with the facilitator, the conveners and the \r\ncountries of the region so as to make progress on the \r\nestablishment of the Middle East zone free from nuclear \r\nweapons and from all weapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate my delegation’s willingness \r\nto fully cooperate with the IAEA and its member States \r\nin strengthening nuclear safety, nuclear security and \r\nsafeguards globally, while promoting the responsible \r\nuse of nuclear energy.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank Mr. Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for his comprehensive and informative \r\npresentation of the annual report of the Agency (see \r\nA/69/255), which covers the period of 1 January to \r\n31 December 2013.\r\nMalaysia reaffirms the principle that the sovereign \r\nright to use nuclear energy comes with the obligation \r\nto ensure that it is used in a safe, secure and peaceful \r\nmanner. We remain fully committed to supporting and \r\nworking with the IAEA and other IAEA member States \r\nand to ensuring the right of countries to the peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy, while at the same time fully ensuring \r\nnuclear non-proliferation, safety and security. Malaysia \r\nis fully cognizant of the need to sign and ratify or \r\naccede to the relevant multilateral instruments aimed \r\nat ensuring the peaceful, safe and secure use of nuclear \r\nenergy. We are refining our regulatory framework and \r\nare currently revising the relevant legislation so as to be \r\nable to enact a comprehensive nuclear law.\r\nRegional cooperation is also an essential aspect for \r\nMalaysia in our efforts to enhance nuclear regulatory \r\ncontrol. Malaysia continues to actively take part in \r\nthe activities of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\n20/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nNations Network of Nuclear Regulatory Bodies or \r\nRelevant Authorities in order to ensure the successful \r\nimplementation of the Network’s 2014-2015 action plan.\r\nMalaysia also supports initiatives of the IAEA’s \r\nInternational Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors \r\nand Fuel Cycles (INPRO) aimed at ensuring that nuclear \r\nenergy is available to contribute to meeting the energy \r\nneeds of the twenty-first century in a sustainable \r\nmanner. My delegation further recognizes the efforts \r\nof the Agency in publishing the INPRO Action Plan \r\n2014-2015. Malaysia will be actively participating in \r\nINPRO activities in line with that two-year Plan.\r\nMalaysia has always emphasized the central role \r\nof the IAEA in the international nuclear security \r\narchitecture. We also recognise the IAEA as the only \r\ninternational organization with the capacity to address \r\npolicy and the technical and regulatory aspects of \r\nnuclear security. In that regard, we acknowledge the \r\ncontinuous efforts by the IAEA to strengthen the \r\nnuclear safety regime and implement its Nuclear Safety \r\nAction Plan. We also look forward to the finalization of \r\nthe Agency’s comprehensive report on the Fukushima \r\nDaiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident.\r\nOn Malaysia’s part, we have established our \r\nnational nuclear security regime through various \r\nmeasures. As a major trading nation, we are also \r\nfocusing on strengthening our detection capabilities \r\nat our major ports of entry and international borders. \r\nWe thank the IAEA for providing the expertise to \r\nrevise our Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan, \r\nwhich has further strengthened the infrastructure \r\nand human capacity development in Malaysia. As a \r\nregional Nuclear Security Support Centre, Malaysia is \r\npleased to continue our cooperation with the Agency \r\nin disseminating best practices and sharing the \r\nexperiences within the region.\r\nMy delegation continues to accord high \r\nimportance to the peaceful uses of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology in agriculture, biotechnology, industry, the \r\nenvironment and medical applications. In that context, \r\nwe strongly believe that research and development \r\nand knowledge-sharing are the keys to the successful \r\nand sustainable development of nuclear technology by \r\nmember States. We therefore recognize the significant \r\ngains to be made in the projects being conducted \r\nunder the Agency’s coordinated research programmes. \r\nMalaysian scientists and researchers have benefitted \r\ngreatly from the hands-on training and research in \r\nthe Nuclear Sciences and Applications Laboratories \r\nin Seibersdorf, Austria. My delegation therefore \r\nappreciates the recognition granted by the Agency \r\nin inviting a Malaysian expert to participate in the \r\nplanning stage of the Renovation of the IAEA Nuclear \r\nApplications Laboratories project.\r\nThis year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe collaboration between the IAEA and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\n(FAO) through the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of \r\nNuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. During \r\nthe commemoration of that historic anniversary on \r\n24 September 2014 in Vienna, the Malaysian Nuclear \r\nAgency was granted an achievement award to celebrate \r\nthe successes and promotion of the applications \r\nof mutation breeding. Through the use of nuclear \r\napplications involving the exposure of seeds to \r\nradiation, Malaysian scientists were able to generate \r\ndesirable traits in plants, such as disease resistance, early \r\nmaturation and better nutrient content. Our partnership \r\nwith the IAEA and FAO has also resulted in progress \r\nin animal production and health and has been extended \r\nto the areas of soil and water management and the crop \r\nnutrition component of food and agriculture. There is \r\ngreat potential in such remarkable inter-agency and \r\nmember State collaboration, which can address global \r\ndevelopmental challenges through civilian applications \r\nof nuclear technology. Malaysia is pleased to work with \r\nthe IAEA and FAO in resolving such challenges.\r\nWith regard to the Agency’s Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme, Malaysia reiterates its strong support \r\nfor that crucial framework. Our position on such \r\ncollaboration is that it should be based on the needs \r\nand requests of member States. The Programme should \r\nalso continue to be formulated and implemented in \r\naccordance with the IAEA’s guiding principles as \r\nwell as the decisions and resolutions of the Agency’s \r\npolicy-making organs. Malaysia is of the view that \r\nthe resources for the IAEA Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme should be made adequate in order to \r\nensure that all planned activities can be implemented \r\neffectively and efficiently. My delegation welcomes the \r\nreport of the Technical Working Group, on financing the \r\nAgency’s activities, which emerged from the Technical \r\nMeeting on Topical Issues in the Development of \r\nNuclear Power Infrastructure, which was held from 4 to \r\n7 February 2014. We hope that the recommendations of \r\nthe Working Group are successfully implemented so as \r\nto allow sufficient, assured and predictable funding for \r\nthe Technical Cooperation Programme.\r\n14-60057 21/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nMalaysia reaffirms its continued and active \r\nimplementation of national technical cooperation \r\nprojects and of regional and interregional technical \r\ncooperation projects under the current cycle. We \r\ncontinue to collaborate closely with the Agency to \r\nensure that all project activities are adequately funded. \r\nWe have also contributed by providing training, \r\nexpertise and contributions in kind to other member \r\nStates. Malaysia also stands ready to offer assistance in \r\nhuman capacity development to other countries in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region. In that connection, my delegation \r\nis grateful for the Agency’s long-standing confidence \r\nin Malaysia, which it has recognized by entrusting \r\nMalaysia with the hosting of the postgraduate course in \r\nradiation protection and the safety of radiation sources, \r\nwhich is currently in its eleventh cycle.\r\nMalaysia reaffirms its belief in the strengthening \r\nand universalization of membership in the Agency, \r\nwhich will help it to effectively carry out its mandates. \r\nIn that regard, my delegation welcomes Comoros, \r\nDjibouti, Guyana and Vanuatu as new member States \r\nof the IAEA. As membership in the Agency grows, so \r\ntoo do the demands for its services. That will also have \r\nimplications on the existing financial challenges faced \r\nby the IAEA and its member States. In that connection, \r\nI would like to conclude by underlining once again \r\nMalaysia’s strong support for the work of the IAEA. \r\nWe hope that its member States will also continue to \r\nprovide the Agency with the backing it fully deserves.\r\nMr. Niyazaliev (Kyrgyzstan): At the outset, let \r\nme thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nfor presenting the IAEA’s annual report for 2013 \r\n(see A/69/255) and for his statement, which included \r\nadditional information on the principal developments \r\nin the Agency’s activities during 2014. The report sets \r\nforth the achievements of the IAEA and the challenges \r\nit will face in the coming years. We fully agree with \r\nDirector General Amano, who on 22 September, \r\nat the fifty-eighth session of the Agency’s General \r\nConference, said: “The impact of our work in the \r\ndaily lives of millions of people around the world is \r\nextraordinary”.\r\nThe Agency’s role is crucial in assisting developing \r\ncountries in using nuclear technology in areas such as \r\nhealth, food and agriculture. No doubt, the continued \r\ngrowth in the use of nuclear power will require the \r\nIAEA’s attention and resources as well. It also plays a \r\nfundamental role in the field of the non-proliferation \r\nof nuclear weapons, utilizing its unique verification \r\nmechanism. In addition, through the Technical \r\nCooperation Programme, the Agency helps its member \r\nStates to build, strengthen and maintain capacities in \r\nthe safe, peaceful and secure use of nuclear technology \r\nin support of sustainable socioeconomic development. \r\nWe fully support those activities of the IAEA.\r\nIt is a pleasure for me, on this occasion, to extend a \r\nwarm welcome to the Union of the Comoros, Djibouti, \r\nGuyana and Vanuatu as new members of the Agency. \r\nWe support the strengthening and universalization of \r\nthe Agency’s membership. \r\nMy delegation hopes that the next high-level IAEA \r\nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security, in \r\nDecember 2016, will be an important opportunity to \r\nreview progress achieved and to map out work for the \r\nfuture.\r\n(spoke in Russian)\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic became a member of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency in 2003, based \r\non our understanding that nuclear technologies form \r\nan important element of State policy in science and \r\ntechnology and that they can facilitate a country’s \r\ntechnological and economic development. \r\nIn 2006, the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic \r\nand the IAEA adopted a technical cooperation \r\nprogramme aimed at ensuring radiation protection \r\nand security and at establishing effective regulatory \r\nbases and infrastructure in accordance with the \r\ncountry’s international obligations. An important \r\nelement of the programme involves carrying out \r\ninternational and regional programmes in radiological \r\nmonitoring, modernizing medicine, implementing and \r\nusing radio therapy and strengthening the capacity \r\nof State institutions. In order to increase the level of \r\ncoordination of work to prepare and implement IAEA \r\nprogrammes and projects in 2013, the Government of \r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic designated a national coordinator \r\nfor technical cooperation with the IAEA. From 8 to \r\n10 April 2014, Bishkek welcomed a delegation from the \r\nAgency, led by the Director of the Division for Europe. \r\nWe hope that those efforts will enable relevant issues \r\nregarding the coordination of actions to be solved \r\nand that we will be able to assess the effectiveness of \r\ncurrent projects and define new areas for cooperation.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic supports resolution GC (58)/\r\nRES/10 of the fifty-eighth session of the IAEA General \r\nConference, on “Measures to strengthen international \r\n22/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\ncooperation in nuclear, radiation, transport and waste \r\nsafety”. That resolution encourages the IAEA continue \r\nits activities relating to the safe geologic disposal of \r\nradioactive waste. \r\nWe express our appreciation to donor countries \r\nand international and regional organizations and \r\nfinancial institutions, including the IAEA, that are \r\nproviding assistance to solve issues connected with \r\nthe uranium tailing sites in Central Asia. In June 2014, \r\nwith the support of the IAEA, a technical meeting of \r\nthe Coordination Group for Uranium Legacy Sites \r\nwas held in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan. The meeting \r\ndiscussed existing problems in the cooperation between \r\ninternational donors and State authorities. \r\nHowever, despite the efforts to overcome those \r\nissues, the problem persists. The situation is getting \r\nworse, in that many of the tailings are exposed to the \r\nthreat of landslides and debris f lows, as they are located \r\nin seismically active areas near the banks of major \r\ntransboundary rivers in the region. We appeal to the \r\nIAEA to step up its assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic \r\nto address the problem of radioactive and toxic waste, \r\nin accordance with last year’s Assembly resolution on \r\nthe role of the international community in averting the \r\nradiation threat in Central Asia (resolution 68/218), \r\nadopted at the initiative of the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic strongly supports IAEA \r\nefforts to strengthen the capacity of member States \r\nto use nuclear technology in medicine. We appreciate \r\nthe assistance provided to developing countries to \r\ngain access to radiotherapy, medical physics, nuclear \r\nmedicine and diagnostic imaging. We would like to note \r\nthe need to strengthen cooperation between Kyrgyzstan \r\nand the IAEA in the field of health. Cancer is one of \r\nthe leading causes of death in our country. Every year, \r\napproximately 3,000 people die of cancer. We are \r\ndeeply interested in developing cooperation with the \r\nIAEA and other parties in the application of nuclear \r\ntechnologies in medicine, especially to treat cancer.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe commitment to the non-proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction is a fundamental principle \r\nof the foreign and domestic policy of my country. We \r\nhave adopted effective measures to bolster the national \r\nexport control regime and to strengthen oversight and \r\nmonitoring of the f low of materials and equipment \r\nused in the development and manufacture of weapons \r\nof mass destruction.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic has ratified the main \r\ninternational agreements on non-proliferation. We \r\nregard international safeguards and the physical \r\nprotection of nuclear materials and facilities as the \r\nfirst line of defence against nuclear terrorism. Thus the \r\nKyrgyz Republic strongly endorses the IAEA efforts \r\nto strengthen the international safeguards system, \r\nincluding the adoption of the additional protocol as \r\nthe safeguards standard. We welcome the practical \r\nmeasures identified in the communiqués of the 2010, \r\n2012 and 2014 Nuclear Security Summits. Fully \r\nrecognizing the dangers that the possession of weapons \r\nof mass destruction by terrorist groups would pose, the \r\nKyrgyz Republic signed the International Convention \r\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004) is an \r\ninternational legal and political instrument of great \r\nsignificance that has real potential to prevent the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The \r\nKyrgyz Republic is taking consistent measures \r\nto effectively implement that resolution, and in \r\n2013 submitted its national plan of action on the \r\nimplementation of resolution 1540 (2004).\r\nOne of the most promising approaches to \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation is the establishment \r\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones. The Kyrgyz Republic \r\ntakes pride in the entry into force in 2009 of the Treaty \r\non a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia. We \r\nwelcome the signing by nuclear States of that Treaty’s \r\nProtocol on Negative Security Assurances on 6 May \r\n2014. The French Republic announced its ratification of \r\nthe Protocol a few days ago, and we urge other nuclear-\r\nweapon States to ratify it as soon as possible. The \r\nKyrgyz Republic is the depository of the Protocol and \r\nis ready to faithfully carry out those functions.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic fully supports the work and \r\nmission of the IAEA and will continue to cooperate with \r\nit actively. We stand firmly committed to the IAEA’s \r\nwork towards the peaceful use of nuclear energy in a \r\nsafe and secure manner for the benefit and development \r\nof humankind and the global community.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): The \r\npast year has been an important one for the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a year in which it has \r\novercome a number of challenges. Other challenges, \r\nwhich are no less important, remain to be addressed in \r\nthe future. Switzerland would like to focus on three of \r\nthem.\r\n14-60057 23/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nFirst, Switzerland welcomes the holding in April \r\n2014 of the sixth Review Meeting of the Contracting \r\nParties to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, organized \r\nby the IAEA, during which we proposed an amendment \r\nto the Convention aimed at strengthening the safety of \r\nnew and old nuclear reactors. The States parties decided \r\nto organize a diplomatic conference in February 2015 \r\nin order to discuss that amendment.\r\nSwitzerland is aware of the important issues \r\nconnected with its proposed amendment, which is why \r\nwe have declared our readiness to work on the text of \r\nthe proposal in order to find a formulation that can \r\ngain consensus. Indeed, more than three years after the \r\nFukushima accident, the conference in February will \r\nprovide us with a unique opportunity, not to be missed, \r\nto restore public confidence in the safety of nuclear \r\nenergy and in the multilateral instruments set up for \r\nthat purpose.\r\nOn the issue of guarantees, Switzerland appreciates \r\nin particular the work done by the IAEA Secretariat \r\nover the course of the past two years on safeguards \r\nimplementation at the State level and on the quality of \r\nthe dialogue that it has established. It is important for \r\nus that the State-level concept has lead to improvements \r\nin terms of costs and reduced workload. Switzerland \r\nplaces particular emphasis on the fact that those \r\nimprovements are intended not only for the benefit of \r\nthe IAEA, but also for that of the State in question.\r\nSwitzerland would also like to acknowledge the \r\ncooperation between the IAEA and Iran since January \r\n2014. At a time when the Iranian issue is entering a \r\ncritical phase, Switzerland encourages the Agency and \r\nIran to continue strengthening their cooperation in \r\norder to facilitate the implementation of a diplomatic \r\nsolution to the satisfaction of all parties.\r\nWhile each State is responsible for its own nuclear \r\nsecurity, it is also important that all States address that \r\ntopic all together at the international level. To that end, \r\nSwitzerland calls on all States that have not yet done so \r\nto ratify the 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the \r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material and the Code \r\nof Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive \r\nSources as soon as possible, or at least before the \r\nfourth Nuclear Security Summit, scheduled to be held \r\nin Washington, D.C., in 2016. Moreover, in order to \r\nachieve the goal of nuclear security in a comprehensive \r\nand credible way, work should be undertaken to \r\nstrengthen the security of all nuclear materials, be they \r\nintended for military or for civilian uses.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the decision of the IAEA to \r\nconvene a conference on nuclear security in 2016 and \r\nnotes that, in the international context, the IAEA is the \r\nonly institution recognized by all States to assume such \r\na role.\r\nMs. Natividad (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nreaffirms its commitment to, and cooperation with, the \r\nobjectives of the International Atomic Agency (IAEA). \r\nWe welcome the report of the Agency (see A/69/255) \r\nand the balanced manner in which its objectives are \r\nbeing pursued. The Philippines welcomes the Union of \r\nthe Comoros, the Republic of Djibouti, the Cooperative \r\nRepublic of Guyana and the Republic of Vanuatu into \r\nthe IAEA.\r\nThe Philippines believes that the Agency continues \r\nto play a vital role in enabling developing countries \r\nsuch as ours to use science and technology for \r\ndevelopment, as well as in maintaining international \r\npeace and security. As Chair of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, Vienna chapter, the Philippines submitted draft \r\nresolutions on behalf of the Group on strengthening \r\nthe Agency’s technical cooperation activities and its \r\nactivities related to nuclear science, technology and \r\napplications.\r\nThere is no doubt that the Philippines has benefitted \r\nfrom our strong partnership with the IAEA. We are \r\ngrateful for the Agency’s valuable support through \r\nour various technical cooperation agreements. We \r\nare pleased to report that the electron beam project, \r\nwhich began in 2009 with funding assistance from \r\nboth the Agency and the Philippine Government, will \r\nbe inaugurated in December. The project will improve \r\nthe competitiveness of our industry by opening up new \r\napplications to create new products and by improving \r\nthe quality of industrial materials. In our case, the new \r\nquarantine treatment against the mango pulp weevil, \r\nusing gamma radiation developed by the Philippine \r\nNuclear Research Institute, will enhance the export \r\ncompetitiveness of the Philippine super mango.\r\nOur Technetium-99m generator facility is also a \r\nrecipient of technical and financial assistance from the \r\nIAEA. It has received its licence to operate and will \r\nbe ready by December 2014. The generator production \r\nfacility is expected to cut the cost of hospital procedures \r\nby at least 50 per cent, making diagnostic tests more \r\naffordable, faster and more accessible to a wider \r\nsegment of the population.\r\n24/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nWith regard to providing better access to clean and \r\nsafe drinking water, the Philippines takes a pioneering \r\nrole as one of three pilot countries participating in \r\nthe IAEA Water Availability Enhancement Project, \r\nwhich aims to enhance national capabilities to assess \r\nthe availability, quality and sustainability of water \r\nresources.\r\nThe Philippines reiterates its strong commitment \r\nto realizing the objectives of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in a \r\ncomprehensive manner. We believe that there should \r\nbe equal progress on all three pillars of the Treaty, \r\nnamely, nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation and \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy. We look forward to \r\nthe 2015 NPT Review Conference, which will allow us \r\nto review and take stock of our progress and chart the \r\nway forward.\r\nThe Philippines strongly supports the establishment \r\nof nuclear-weapon-free zones as a way to contribute \r\nto global peace and security and to the end goal of \r\nnuclear disarmament. The Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) established the South-East \r\nAsia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone for that purpose. We \r\nare committed to continuing our dialogue with the \r\nnuclear-weapon States to address concerns over their \r\nproposed reservations to the protocol to the Treaty. We \r\ntherefore welcome the working-level meeting among \r\nASEAN member States and the nuclear-weapon States \r\non the margins of the First Committee session. The \r\nPhilippines looks forward to the nuclear-weapon States’ \r\nsigning and ratifying the protocol without reservation.\r\nBeyond our region, the Philippines is especially \r\ninterested in securing lasting peace in the Middle East. \r\nWe again call for the convening of a conference on the \r\nestablishment of a Middle East zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, \r\neven before the convening of the 2015 NPT Review \r\nConference. We believe that the convening of the \r\nconference on the Middle East will provide positive \r\nmomentum to the Review Conference. The Conferences \r\non the Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons are \r\nalso providing such necessary impetus. We urge all \r\nStates to participate in those discussions, particularly \r\nin the upcoming Conference in Vienna in December.\r\nAs we pursue our goal of the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons, it is equally important to ensure that \r\nexisting nuclear facilities and materials are safe and \r\nsecure. The Philippines therefore supports the IAEA’s \r\nwork to strengthen the global nuclear safety regime \r\nthrough the efficient and effective implementation of \r\ninternational legal instruments, the development of \r\nsafety standards, the enhancement of national safety \r\ninfrastructure, the coordination of international \r\nemergency preparedness and response mechanisms \r\nand the promotion of a nuclear safety culture. In that \r\nregard, the Philippines co-sponsored the resolution \r\nadopted by the IAEA General Conference on measures \r\nto strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, \r\nradiation, transport and waste safety.\r\nOn nuclear safety, the Philippines supports the \r\ncontinuing implementation of the IAEA Action Plan on \r\nNuclear Safety and welcomes the progress made with \r\nthe full cooperation of member States, especially in the \r\nsafety assessment worldwide.\r\nWe are specifically pleased with the progress \r\nmade in the safety assessments of nuclear power plants \r\nand the conduct of the IAEA’s peer-review services \r\nand emergency preparedness and response. As our \r\ncontribution in that field, the Philippines will host a \r\nnational workshop on nuclear security information \r\nmanagement systems from 25 to 26 November.\r\nMy country also looks forward to the conduct of \r\nan Integrated Nuclear Security Support Plan review \r\nmeeting in Manila at the end of this month, which will \r\nfocus on the Agency’s assistance in the establishment \r\nof the national nuclear security support centre.\r\nThe Philippines is also requesting an International \r\nNuclear Security Advisory Service mission focused on \r\nnuclear security at major public events so as to assist \r\nthe Government in preparing for the meeting of Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation Heads of State and \r\nGovernment to be held in the Philippines in late 2015.\r\nOur achievements in the various aspects of nuclear \r\nsecurity would not have been possible without the \r\nsupport of the IAEA, our partner States, the European \r\nUnion and other organizations. Our commitment \r\nto strengthening nuclear security stems from the \r\nrecognition that nuclear security, along with nuclear \r\nsafety, is integral to the continued development and \r\nenjoyment of the benefits of the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy.\r\nOn nuclear safeguards, the Philippines joined \r\nover 60 member States in co-sponsoring the General \r\nConference resolution entitled “Implementation of the \r\nNPT safeguards agreement between the Agency and the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea”, which calls \r\nupon the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\n14-60057 25/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\nrefrain from conducting further nuclear tests pursuant \r\nto relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nOn a final note, the Philippines is keen on pursuing \r\nstronger partnership and cooperation with the IAEA in \r\nthe coming years.\r\nMrs. Nguyen Phuong Nga (Viet Nam): First of \r\nall, I would like to thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for his comprehensive introduction of the \r\nannual report of the IAEA (see A/69/255). Viet Nam \r\ncommends the IAEA for its achievements on all three \r\npillars of its mandate, namely, science and technology, \r\nsafety and security, and safeguards and verification.\r\nViet Nam advocates the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy and technology for development in line with \r\ninternational obligations. We applaud the IAEA’s \r\ncontinuing efforts to, inter alia, assist over 30 countries, \r\nincluding Viet Nam, in preparing the infrastructure \r\nnecessary for introducing nuclear power into their \r\nenergy mix. In addition, the IAEA plays an important \r\nrole in helping developing countries to achieve the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and in contributing to \r\nthe preparation of the post-2015 sustainable development \r\ngoals through its Technical Cooperation Programme \r\nand various activities in nuclear applications.\r\nViet Nam lends its full support to the crucial \r\nrole played by the IAEA in the field of nuclear safety \r\nand security. We appreciate the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear \r\nSafety.\r\nThrough a number of mechanisms, the IAEA assists \r\nmember States in strengthening national nuclear safety \r\nprogrammes. During 2013, the Agency conducted \r\n88 training events covering all aspects of nuclear \r\nsecurity, involving more than 2,000 people, through its \r\nInternational Nuclear Security Education Network.\r\nViet Nam acknowledges the IAEA’s continuing \r\nefforts in the field of nuclear verification and safeguards. \r\nWhile progress continued in the implementation \r\nof comprehensive safeguards agreements and \r\nadditional protocols, we are happy to see that two \r\nmore comprehensive safeguards agreements and \r\nfour additional protocols have entered into force. We \r\nare confident that the IAEA, a unique international \r\norganization with expertise in all aspects of nuclear \r\nenergy, will continue to play a leading role in shaping \r\na safer world.\r\nViet Nam highly appreciates the Agency’s \r\nwide-ranging technical cooperation and support efforts \r\nover the past years. Since 2000, the IAEA has been \r\nassisting Viet Nam in implementing over 200 technical \r\ncooperation projects at the national, regional and \r\ninterregional levels, with a total disbursement of over \r\n$15 million. More than 1,200 Vietnamese scientists \r\nand technicians have benefited from various training \r\nprogrammes. We note with satisfaction that under \r\nthe country programme framework for the period \r\n2011-2015, cooperation between the IAEA and Viet \r\nNam has brought productive results in the main areas of \r\nnuclear power infrastructure and nuclear safety, health \r\ncare and industrial applications and environmental \r\nprotection.\r\nIn 2013, in close collaboration with the IAEA, Viet \r\nNam prepared feasibility studies for two sites for its first \r\nnuclear power plants. Viet Nam’s strong commitment \r\nto the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology \r\nand to conducting its nuclear power programmes in \r\naccordance with the highest safety standards has been \r\nwidely acknowledged. During his visit to Viet Nam in \r\nJanuary, Director General Amano highly appreciated \r\nViet Nam’s preparations to launch its national nuclear \r\npower programme.\r\nAs Chair of the IAEA Board of Governors for \r\nthe 2013-2014 term, we made active contributions, in \r\na balanced and constructive manner, to realizing the \r\nobjectives and missions of the IAEA. My delegation \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nheartfelt appreciation to all member States, international \r\npartners and the IAEA for their valuable support and \r\ncooperation in fulfilling our responsibilities.\r\nFinally, Viet Nam is pleased to sponsor the draft \r\nresolution before us today, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency” (A/69/L.7).\r\nMr. de Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): I thank the \r\ndelegation of Slovakia for presenting the draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/69/L.7, which Brazil is glad \r\nto sponsor. Brazil welcomes the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya \r\nAmano, and thanks him for his briefing.\r\nBrazil continues to support the efforts of the IAEA \r\nto strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nsafeguards, in strict accordance with the relevant legal \r\ninstruments entered into between member States and the \r\nAgency, taking into account the necessary distinction \r\n26/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nbetween legal obligations and voluntary commitments, \r\nsuch as the additional protocol.\r\nIn its 2014 resolution GC(58)/RES/14, entitled \r\n“Strengthening the Effectiveness and Improving the \r\nEfficiency of Agency Safeguards”, the IAEA General \r\nConference welcomed, with Brazil’s support, the \r\nclarifications and additional information provided by \r\nthe Director General in the Supplementary Document \r\non the so-called State-level concept. The General \r\nConference welcomed in particular the important \r\nassurances contained in the document and in the \r\nstatements made by the Director General and the \r\nSecretariat. \r\nAmong those assurances, I would highlight the \r\nfollowing. The State-level concept will not entail \r\nadditional rights or obligations under the relevant \r\nsafeguards agreements. The State-level concept will be \r\napplied to all States with safeguards agreements. The \r\nState-level concept is not a substitute for an additional \r\nprotocol, nor is it designed as a means for the Agency \r\nto obtain from a State without an additional protocol \r\nin force the information and access provided for in \r\nthat instrument, and additional protocol measures will \r\ncontinue to be implemented only in States with an \r\nadditional protocol in force. Lastly, States will not be \r\nrequired to provide any additional information beyond \r\ntheir existing legal obligations.\r\nThe General Conference also noted that the \r\ndevelopment and implementation of State-level \r\napproaches required close consultation and \r\ncoordination with the State and/or regional authority. \r\nIt also required agreement by the State concerned on \r\npractical arrangements for the effective implementation \r\nof all safeguards measures identified for use in the field \r\nif not already in place.\r\nThe development of the Supplementary Document \r\nand the decisions taken by the General Conference on \r\nthe State-level concept resulted from an unprecedented \r\nprocess of consultations and technical meetings between \r\nthe Secretariat and member States this year. For Brazil, \r\nthat process introduced a new and encouraging dynamic \r\nin the manner in which safeguards issues should be \r\ndealt with within the IAEA.\r\nThe openness and transparency that have \r\ncharacterized the exchanges between the Secretariat \r\nand member States should be continuing features of the \r\nongoing and future treatment of safeguards within the \r\nAgency. In Brazil’s view, any future steps related to the \r\ndevelopment of the concept in the light of the experience \r\nto be acquired by the Secretariat in the coming years \r\nwould be acceptable only after close consultation and \r\ncoordination with member States, with the results being \r\nconsolidated in a future document for consideration by \r\nthe IAEA Board of Governors.\r\nAs we approach the 2015 Review Conference of \r\nthe Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, serious consideration must be given \r\nto nuclear disarmament steps as an indispensable \r\ngoal for upholding the Treaty’s continued authority, \r\nrelevance and integrity.\r\nThe IAEA has performed essential verification \r\nactivities in the past, either in country-specific \r\nsituations or pursuant to requests from interested States \r\nparties to disarmament agreements. In that context, \r\nBrazil welcomes the fact that in its 2014 safeguards \r\nresolution, the General Conference noted that the IAEA \r\nmust remain ready to assist with verification tasks \r\nunder nuclear disarmament or arms control agreements \r\nthat it may be requested to carry out by the States \r\nparties to such agreements. We believe that role must \r\nbe supported and pursued.\r\nThe action plan of the 2010 Review Conference \r\nalso called for the wider application of safeguards \r\nto peaceful nuclear facilities in the nuclear-weapon \r\nStates and stressed that comprehensive safeguards \r\nand additional protocols should be universally applied \r\nonce the complete elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nhad been achieved. We will be tasked to consider the \r\nimplementation of the 2010 action plan at the Review \r\nConference next year.\r\nAs to the negotiations on Iran’s nuclear programme, \r\nI wish to stress that there is no alternative to a political \r\nnegotiated solution to that issue. We should strive to \r\npreserve the positive atmosphere of November 2013, \r\nwhich made possible the agreements reached both \r\nwith the IAEA and with the P5+1. We reiterate our \r\ncall on all parties to remain engaged to work towards \r\na comprehensive, long-term solution to the issue and \r\nthe normalization of the implementation of the IAEA \r\nsafeguards in Iran.\r\nBrazil attaches great importance to the peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear energy, from power generation, \r\nhuman health and industry to agriculture and \r\nenvironmental protection. We are convinced that nuclear \r\n14-60057 27/28\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.37\r\ntechnology will continue to be of great relevance for \r\nthe achievement of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand the future sustainable development goals.\r\nAs a country that is both a recipient and a donor, \r\nBrazil fully supports the constant strengthening and \r\nsteady implementation of the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme. Building upon an initiative \r\nby the IAEA Deputy Director General, Brazil has \r\nincreased its cooperation in the nuclear field with \r\nPortuguese-speaking countries in Africa, in particular \r\nAngola and Mozambique, focusing on areas such as \r\nlicensing, medical applications and management.\r\nIn our view, apart from being one of the IAEA’s \r\nmain statutory tenets, technical cooperation activities \r\nalso constitute a key instrument for ensuring compliance \r\nwith article IV of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons, and should therefore be a primary \r\nfocus of attention of next year’s Review Conference.\r\nMr. Rakhmetullin (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan \r\nexpresses its deepest appreciation to Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for the Agency’s very comprehensive \r\nreport (see A/69/255). We commend the work of the \r\nAgency in its efforts to respond to changing times and \r\nchallenges and the specific needs of member States.\r\nKazakhstan, as a member of the IAEA, is proud \r\nto work closely with the Agency in order to strengthen \r\npolicies related to nuclear energy, nuclear disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation, as well as nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity. We believe that it is important to bring \r\ninternational legal norms into line with the reality \r\nof the existence of de facto nuclear-weapon States, \r\nnecessitating compliance with the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) by States \r\nparties. In addition, regular stress tests of nuclear plants \r\nand protection systems, together with rapid rescue \r\nresponse tests, need to be rigorously conducted by the \r\nIAEA, in accordance with the recommendations of the \r\nNuclear Security Summits held in Washington, D.C., \r\nSeoul and The Hague.\r\nKazakhstan is the world’s largest producer and \r\nsupplier of uranium and is able to expand its fuel \r\nfabrication capabilities for the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy within the framework of the IAEA safeguards. \r\nThe Government of Kazakhstan continues to make \r\nprogress on the establishment of the IAEA Low-Enriched \r\nUranium Bank, the proposed site of which is the Ulba \r\nMetallurgical Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Kazakhstan. \r\nDuring 2013, work focused on the financial, legal and \r\ntechnical arrangements and on assessing the proposed \r\nsite for the fuel bank. In addition to hosting the bank, \r\nKazakhstan has made a contribution of $150,000 to \r\nthe Agency for the project. Furthermore, our national \r\natomic energy company, KazAtomProm, is working in \r\nclose collaboration with IAEA in that regard.\r\nNow that the five nuclear-weapon States have \r\nsigned the Protocol to the Central Asian Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free-Zone Treaty, the region can continue \r\nto work towards reducing nuclear terrorism, the \r\nsmuggling of nuclear weapons and radioactive \r\nmaterials, and ecological radiation in the region. We \r\ncontinue to implement the International Convention \r\nfor the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism and \r\nto host workshops and meetings to support Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1540 (2004) in order to strengthen \r\nmeasures to combat illegal trafficking in nuclear and \r\nother materials.\r\nAs a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group and \r\nthe Zangger Committee, Kazakhstan maintains the \r\nstrictest control over its equipment and installations \r\nfor enriching uranium and reprocessing spent nuclear \r\nfuel. Kazakhstan has also ratified and acceded to four \r\nmajor conventions on nuclear safety and is reviewing a \r\ndraft law to accede to the Vienna Convention on Civil \r\nLiability for Nuclear Damage. We are decommissioning \r\nour DN 350 nuclear reactor, and with the support \r\nof the United States Department of Energy, we are \r\nimplementing a project to convert the second research \r\nreactor into a facility that will produce radioisotopes \r\nfrom low-enriched uranium. My country welcomes the \r\nproposal to strengthen the infrastructure of the IAEA’s \r\nIncident and Emergency Centre as the global focal \r\npoint for nuclear and radiological safety and security-\r\nrelated incidents.\r\nDespite the fact that Kazakhstan is a key and \r\nresponsible member of the IAEA, my country has \r\nbeen denied the opportunity to participate in the \r\nwork of elective bodies, owing to the existing rules of \r\nprocedure. We fully support the early entry into force \r\nof the amendments to article VI of the IAEA statute, \r\nand we hope that a solution will be found.\r\nKazakhstan is pleased with its strong 2010-2015 \r\ntechnical cooperation agreement with the IAEA in the \r\nareas of nuclear education, medicine and agriculture, \r\nresearch reactor safety, and radioisotope and radiation \r\napplications for collective global human security. The \r\ncountry contributes regularly to the IAEA budget and \r\n28/28 14-60057\r\nA/69/PV.37 03/11/2014\r\nto its Technical Cooperation Fund and stands ready to \r\nfulfil its financial obligations. Since nuclear security \r\nand safety are so critical, Kazakhstan has chosen that \r\ntopic as a priority issue for its bid for a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term.\r\nWe fully support the IAEA’s mandate and look \r\nforward to another cycle of even more productive \r\ncollaboration on current and future issues in nuclear \r\ntechnology.\r\nMs. Carayanides (Australia): Australia commends \r\nDirector General Amano for introducing the report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the \r\nAgency’s achievements and the challenges it faces over \r\nthe coming years (see A/69/255).\r\nAustralia is honoured to be a member of the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors and a non-permanent member \r\nof the Security Council for 2013-2014 and takes very \r\nseriously the responsibilities that those roles entail. \r\nAustralia attaches great importance to the central \r\nrole played by the IAEA in improving the safety and \r\nsecurity of nuclear activities, enhancing social and \r\neconomic development through the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear science and technology, and verifying States’ \r\nnon-proliferation commitments.\r\nAustralia fully supports the right of IAEA \r\nmembers to enjoy the benefits of the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy in accordance with their international \r\nobligations. The IAEA makes a valuable contribution \r\nto economic development, human health and \r\nenvironmental protection. We are heartened by the \r\nDirector General’s having quickly established a task \r\nforce to enhance the response capabilities of Member \r\nStates in regard to outbreaks of zoonotic diseases, \r\nincluding the Ebola virus.\r\nWe note that global demand for nuclear medicines \r\nis increasing at a time when a number of major \r\nradioisotope-producing research reactors are either \r\nclosing or entering extended maintenance in the next \r\nfew years. In response, Australia is expanding its \r\nproduction of molybdenum-99, which is used in over \r\n80 per cent of nuclear medicine procedures. When \r\nour new facility comes online in 2016, we will be able \r\nto produce over 20 per cent of the estimated global \r\ndemand for that vital radioisotope. Consistent with our \r\ncurrent production, that increased capability will be \r\nfully based on low-enriched uranium technology.\r\nAll members of the Agency must work together to \r\nensure an effective safeguards system. Confidence in \r\nthat system provides the necessary assurances about \r\nthe peaceful nature of nuclear activities and is the basic \r\nfoundation for nuclear trade and cooperation, security \r\nand continuing progress on nuclear disarmament. \r\nAustralia welcomes the Director General’s continued \r\nefforts to improve the effectiveness of the safeguards \r\nsystem, including through the Supplementary \r\nDocument to the Report on the Conceptualization and \r\nDevelopment of Safeguards Implementation at the State \r\nLevel. Australia urges all States that have yet to do \r\nso to sign and bring into force an additional protocol \r\nwith respect to their safeguards agreements as soon as \r\npossible, in order to maximize the effectiveness of the \r\nsafeguards system.\r\nAs Director General Amano reminded us in July, \r\nconstant vigilance and collective action are necessary \r\nto ensure nuclear security. We are pleased to see the \r\nAgency continue to take an active lead in that field, \r\nincluding by participating in the Nuclear Security \r\nSummit in The Hague and hosting an international \r\nconference on nuclear forensics this year. We encourage \r\nMember States to ratify the 2005 Amendment to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial so as to ensure its early entry into force.\r\nAustralia acknowledges the ongoing efforts of the \r\nIAEA in nuclear safety. We look forward to the report \r\nof the Director General on the causes and effects of the \r\nFukushima nuclear accident, as well as the subsequent \r\nintegration of the IAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety \r\ninto the Agency’s normal programme of work.\r\nFinally, the external environment in which the \r\nAgency operates is highly f luid. The Agency must \r\nmaintain its capacity to respond quickly and effectively \r\nto developments, be they related to nuclear safety, \r\nphysical protection, nuclear proliferation or sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Australia will continue to support the \r\nDirector General’s efforts to strengthen the contribution \r\nthat the Agency makes to the promotion of the use of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes and to provide \r\nassurances that all nuclear activities are exclusively \r\nfor the purposes of peace. Given the important work \r\nof the IAEA, Australia is pleased to co-sponsor and \r\nsupport the draft resolution on the report of the IAEA \r\n(A/69/L.7).\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
