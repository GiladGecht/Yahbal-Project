"*1460259*\r\n14-60259 (E)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Rambally \r\n(Saint Lucia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 86 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/69/255)\r\nDraft resolution (A/69/L.7)\r\nMs. Paik Ji-ah (Republic of Korea): My delegation \r\nwould like to thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for presenting the Agency’s report (see \r\nreviewing the IAEA’s work over the past year A/69/255) \r\nand outlining future priorities (see A/69/PV.37). With \r\nnuclear power and applications of nuclear technology \r\nexpected to play a growing role in the coming decades, \r\nwe attach great importance to the central role of the \r\nAgency in promoting safe, secure and peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy. We are pleased with the report, which \r\nsummarizes well the wide range of the Agency’s work \r\ncarried out in line with the priorities set by its member \r\nStates. \r\nTaking this opportunity, my delegation would like \r\nto comment on the Agency’s activities and related \r\ndevelopments in the fields of nuclear safety, security \r\nand safeguards.\r\nFirst of all, the IAEA has made important \r\ncontributions to the global nuclear safety framework, in \r\nterms of both improving the safety standards of nuclear \r\nfacilities and materials and increasing awareness of \r\nsafety-related issues among member States. We look \r\nforward to the continued implementation of the IAEA \r\nAction Plan on Nuclear Safety.\r\nWe also look forward to the publication of the \r\ncomprehensive report next year on the Fukushima \r\nDaiichi nuclear accident. My delegation sincerely hopes \r\nthat the important lessons and recommendations that \r\ncan be drawn from that accident will be incorporated \r\ninto each member State’s nuclear safety infrastructure in \r\norder to better prepare us to avoid such tragic accidents \r\nand to minimize the impact from such accidents in the \r\nfuture. In that regard, we hope that the commitment to \r\nsharing information in a transparent and timely manner \r\ncontinues.\r\nWe are pleased to note the IAEA’s many productive \r\nactivities in the field of nuclear security over the past year. \r\nWe look forward to the second International Conference \r\non Nuclear Security, to be held in December 2016, based \r\non the outcome of the first Conference, in 2013. The \r\nwork of the Nuclear Security Guidance Committee has \r\nalso been fruitful, contributing to greater transparency, \r\nquality, coherence and consistency in publications on \r\nnuclear security guidance. In addition, we appreciate \r\nthe Agency’s focused approach to bringing into force \r\nthe 2005 Amendment to the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material, which has resulted in \r\nadditional ratifications by member States, including \r\nKorea in May.\r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.38\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n38th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 3 November 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

As \r\nwe prepare for the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in \r\n2016, we look forward to exploring ways to maximize \r\nthe synergy between the IAEA and the Nuclear Security \r\nSummit process.\r\nTurning to safeguards-related issues, my \r\ndelegation appreciates the Agency’s efforts to \r\nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of safeguards \r\nimplementation. We welcome the fact that the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governers took note of the Supplementary \r\nDocument to the report on the State-level concept. We \r\nare convinced that the State-level concept will allow \r\nthe Agency to make better use of its resources by \r\nconcentrating efforts on areas of greater significance \r\nfor safeguards and on improving responsiveness to \r\nchanging circumstances. We are also encouraged by \r\nthe increasing number of comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreements, additional protocols and amended small-\r\nquantities protocols in force.\r\nHowever, the cases of non-compliance on the \r\npart of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nIran and Syria continue to pose grave challenges to \r\nthe international non-proliferation regime and the \r\nIAEA safeguards system. Of particular concern to \r\nmy delegation is North Korea’s continuous pursuit \r\nof its nuclear capability. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has conducted three nuclear tests \r\nand publicly threatened the international society \r\nby the announcement of further nuclear tests. In \r\naddition, North Korea continued its nuclear activities \r\nin Yongbyon, including the operation of a 5-megawatt \r\ngraphite-moderated reactor. As the IAEA Director \r\nGeneral aptly highlighted in his latest report of \r\nSeptember 2014, such actions are clear violations of \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nWe once again urge the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to come into full compliance with \r\nits obligations under all relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and commitments under the 19 September \r\n2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks. Standing \r\nfirm by its principle that North Korea’s nuclear ambition \r\ncannot be tolerated, the Republic of Korea will continue \r\nits efforts with the international community to achieve \r\ncomplete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization \r\nof North Korea.\r\nTurning to the Iranian nuclear issue, we commend \r\nthe Agency for its efforts to actively engage Iran under \r\nthe Joint Statement on a Framework for Cooperation, of \r\nNovember 2013, with the aim of resolving all present \r\nand past verification issues relating to the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme. We also appreciate the Agency’s \r\nrole in verifying and monitoring Iran’s voluntary \r\nmeasures under the Joint Plan of Action between the \r\npermanent five plus one and Iran in November 2013. \r\nWe call upon Iran to work closely with the Agency in \r\norder to resolve all outstanding issues, including those \r\nrelating to possible military dimensions, in a timely \r\nmanner.\r\nIn the light of our full support for the IAEA’s work to \r\nachieve our common goal of harnessing nuclear energy \r\nin the service of peace and development for humanity, \r\nthe Republic of Korea is pleased to co-sponsor draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.7, on the report of the IAEA.\r\nMr. Elshandawily (Egypt): I make this statement \r\non behalf of Mr. Abdellatif Aboulatta, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Egypt to the United Nations.\r\nEgypt appreciates its ongoing cooperation with \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in \r\nthe Agency’s fields of expertise, serving economic, \r\nsocial and human development. That cooperation \r\nis especially important as Egypt is developing a \r\nprogramme to construct nuclear power plants to \r\nproduce electrical energy and to desalinate water in \r\norder to meet the growing demands of its citizens, \r\nincluding those of the industrial sector. There is broad \r\ncooperation between Egypt and the IAEA to enhance \r\nEgyptian capabilities and human resources within that \r\nprogramme. In addition, there are various technical \r\ncooperation programmes between Egypt and the \r\nIAEA in other fields of nuclear applications, including \r\nscientific research, food security, the environment, \r\ncancer treatment, industry, mineral wealth and water \r\nresources, to name just a few.\r\nEgypt also welcomes cooperation with the IAEA in \r\nthe field of nuclear security, the prime responsibility for \r\nwhich rests with the State at the national level. Egypt \r\nreaffirms the central role of the IAEA in enhancing \r\nthe peaceful uses by member States of nuclear energy, \r\n14-60259 3/11\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.38\r\nin parallel with efforts to enhance nuclear security. I \r\nwould like to point out that Egypt, in cooperation with \r\nthe Agency, is nearing the completion of a regional \r\nNuclear Security Training and Support Centre. Egypt \r\nalso welcomes cooperation with the Agency in the field \r\nof nuclear safety. That work is of special importance \r\nin guaranteeing national capabilities to deal with \r\nnuclear and radiological emergencies. Egypt benefits \r\nsubstantially from cooperating with the IAEA to \r\nenhance its capacities in that regard.\r\nEgypt would also like to highlight the importance \r\nof the support provided by the IAEA through regional \r\ncooperation agreements in the fields of nuclear energy \r\nand technology. We refer in particular to the African \r\nRegional Cooperative Agreement for Research, \r\nDevelopment and Training Related to Nuclear Science \r\nand Technology, in which Egypt actively participates, \r\nwhich benefits regional cooperation within the African \r\ncontinent as well as with Arab States.\r\nWith regard to matters concerning nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation, Egypt reiterates the importance \r\nof enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nAgency’s comprehensive safeguards. We would like \r\nto recall in that regard the adoption by the fifty-eighth \r\nGeneral Conference of the IAEA of Egypt’s annual \r\nresolution regarding the application of IAEA safeguards \r\nin the Middle East. The implementation of the resolution \r\nwould ensure that the remaining non-member State in \r\nthe region accedes to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear-weapon \r\nState, and would affirm the urgent need for that State \r\nto agree forthwith to the application of comprehensive \r\nfull-scope Agency safeguards to its nuclear facilities \r\nas an important confidence-building measure and as a \r\nstep in enhancing peace and security in the context of \r\nthe establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nEgypt is keen to enhance the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of the Agency’s safeguards. It is vital \r\nthat the mechanisms and measures aimed at achieving \r\nthat goal are clear and transparent and are undertaken \r\nwith the participation of all IAEA member States. \r\nOnly that can guarantee full respect for the inalienable \r\nright of all States to development, research, production \r\nand use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, in \r\naccordance with article IV of the NPT. In that context, \r\nEgypt would also like to affirm that the development of \r\nAgency safeguards should not lead to the imposition of \r\nadditional obligations exceeding the current contractual \r\nobligations of member States.\r\nMr. Benítez Verson (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba supports the important work of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and we welcome the \r\nnew member States: Comoros, Djibouti, Guyana and \r\nVanuatu.\r\nTechnical cooperation is one of the main pillars \r\nof the IAEA and should be given priority attention. \r\nIn the 2012-2013 cycle, Cuba reached a high rate of \r\nimplementation in its technical cooperation programme \r\nwith the IAEA, a rate of 97.34 per cent. Latin America \r\nfor its part, was the region that achieved the highest \r\nrate of project execution, 89.3 per cent. Our region can \r\nand should obtain more resources from the IAEA for \r\ntechnical cooperation.\r\nCuba has updated its national programming \r\nframework for technical cooperation during the 2014-\r\n2018 period, which is based on our country’s efforts in \r\nthe early detection and treatment of cancer, the leading \r\ncause of death in Cuba. We have given particular \r\npriority to the IAEA Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy. That Programme should be provided the \r\nfinancial resources necessary to broaden its scope and \r\nits results.\r\nThe criminal policy of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the Government \r\nof the United States against Cuba for more than \r\nfive decades is affecting the implementation of our \r\ntechnical cooperation programme with the IAEA. \r\nThe embargo significantly increases our country’s \r\ndifficulties in acquiring the necessary equipment for \r\ntechnical cooperation projects. That raises costs and \r\ndelays implementation unnecessarily.\r\nThe effective management of nuclear security \r\ndoes not allow for any exclusions or selectivity. The \r\ninternational norms that govern nuclear security \r\nshould be adopted within the framework of the IAEA, \r\nbased on multilateral negotiations that are transparent \r\nand inclusive, with the participation of all States. \r\nCuba welcomes the holding of the upcoming IAEA \r\nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security, which \r\nwill take place in December 2016 with participation at \r\nthe ministerial level.\r\nThe entry into force of the Amendment to the \r\nConvention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial, which Cuba ratified last year, will give \r\n4/11 14-60259\r\nA/69/PV.38 03/11/2014\r\ngreater protection to nuclear installations and materials \r\nand facilitate cooperation between States to prevent and \r\ncombat related crimes. We will continue to enhance our \r\nexcellent cooperation with the IAEA in implementing \r\nprojects for improved nuclear physical security and the \r\ncontrol of our borders and the installations that have in \r\nCategory 1 and Category 2 radioactive materials. In the \r\ncontext of the IAEA safeguards, for seven consecutive \r\nyears, our country has obtained double certification \r\nand satisfactory results from IAEA inspections.\r\nWe must preserve the credibility of the IAEA’s \r\nactivities in the area of safeguards, ensuring impartial \r\nand professional updates in that area. Cuba supports \r\nthe efforts to improve the efficiency of the safeguards, \r\nprovided that that does not affect the legitimate rights \r\nof States nor establish any discriminatory or selective \r\npractices. The State-level concept of safeguards must \r\nbe cautiously analysed by according due respect to the \r\nconcerns of States in that regard.\r\nWe need greater efficiency and effectiveness in \r\nadopting IAEA decisions. That will involve enhancing \r\nthe General Conference as the supreme legislative body, \r\nin which all member States participate. We also need to \r\nexamine in depth the membership and functions of the \r\nBoard of Governors.\r\nWe welcome the progress made in ongoing \r\nnegotiations between the IAEA and the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran. We encourage further progress in that process. \r\nWe also reaffirm our firm support for establishing a \r\nMiddle East nuclear-weapons-free zone. We deeply \r\nregret the fact that the conference on that issue, planned \r\nfor 2012, has still not been held. That jeopardizes the \r\ncredibility of the entire system established by the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nCuba encourages the holding of that conference without \r\nany further delay.\r\nThe existence of over 16,000 nuclear weapons \r\ncontinues to seriously threaten humanity with \r\nannihilation. That is why nuclear disarmament cannot \r\nbe a goal that is continually postponed and made \r\nconditional. The only way to avoid the use, or threat \r\nof use, of such weapons is their total elimination and \r\nprohibition under strict international verification. It is \r\nup to the IAEA to play an important role in achieving \r\nthat goal.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to emphasize the fact that \r\nCuba will remain steadfast in the battle to achieve a \r\nworld free of nuclear weapons. That is our commitment \r\nto future generations.\r\nMs. Babio (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina wishes to express its appreciation of and \r\nsupport for the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) and to thank the Agency for its annual report \r\nfor 2013 (see A/69/255). Argentina believes that \r\nthe IAEA has played a central role with regard to in \r\nnon-proliferation and international cooperation for \r\nscientific and technological development in the nuclear \r\nfield.\r\nIts effective monitoring of nuclear activities is \r\nessential, for example, to meet nuclear security goals. \r\nOur country has steadily maintained that the leadership \r\nrole in articulating the future design of the nuclear \r\nsecurity architecture should be the responsibility of \r\nthe IAEA. It is the relevant body in the United Nations \r\nsystem in the field of the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy.\r\nArgentina believes that one of the pillars of the \r\nAgency’s work is nuclear and radiation security and the \r\nsafe transport and handling of radioactive waste - areas \r\nthat my country thinks are very important - as well as \r\ninternational cooperation in that field. The IAEA plays \r\na key role in promoting nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes, and our country contributes significantly to \r\nthe work of the Agency with experts and services, and \r\nis a regional reference point.\r\nSince the establishment of the IAEA in 1957, \r\nArgentina has actively participated in its technical \r\ncooperation programme through its technical agencies. \r\nOur active presence there has allowed us to finance \r\na large number of national and regional projects, as \r\nhas our participation as a donor to third countries \r\nthrough the IAEA, including to programmes within the \r\nRegional Cooperation Agreement for the Promotion of \r\nNuclear Science and Technology in Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nAs a point of interest with regard to the technical \r\ncooperation programme for the biennium 2014-2015, \r\nwe are participating in 20 technical cooperation \r\nprojects at the national, regional and interregional \r\nlevels. Argentina is also up to date with its financial \r\nobligations for technical cooperation and has made \r\nadvance payments for its voluntary contributions to the \r\nIAEA Technical Cooperation Fund for 2015 and 2016. \r\n14-60259 5/11\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.38\r\nIn addition, our country has actively participated \r\nin the work of expert groups in the areas of power \r\nreactors, research reactors, nuclear fuel cycles and \r\nthe development of infrastructure. I will highlight \r\nthe current promotion of regional training with the \r\npromotion of the online platform of our main training \r\nreactor, the RA-6. We also play a key role in LANET, \r\nthe Latin American Network for Education in Nuclear \r\nTechnology. Argentina believes that we should join \r\nforces so as to generate more solid, effective and \r\nsustainable long-term nuclear infrastructure. \r\nInternational guarantees constitute another pillar \r\nof the Agency. Along with nuclear and radiological \r\nsafety, they are especially important for enhancing \r\nnuclear development. Argentina would like to reiterate \r\nin concluding that those guarantees must be anchored \r\nin an atmosphere of cooperation dialogue between the \r\nAgency and member States.\r\nMr. Al-Taie (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): My Government \r\nwould like to express its gratitude to the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to its Director \r\nGeneral, Mr. Yukiya Amano, and its Secretariat for \r\nproducing the Agency’s annual report for 2013 (see \r\nA/69/255). We appreciate the work of the Agency \r\nduring the period covered by the report, particularly \r\nits activities concerning safeguards, verification,and \r\nnuclear safety and security, and in the areas of science \r\nand technology and technological cooperation. That \r\nwork allows member States to enjoy progress and \r\ngrowth.\r\nMy delegation reasserts the inalienable rights of the \r\nparties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) to produce and use nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes and to develop cooperative projects \r\nand national programmes in that field, in particular \r\nin developing countries, free from the imposition by \r\ncertain States of obstacles, monopolies or conditions \r\nthat could endanger the interests of developing States.\r\nWe reaffirm the importance of the principles of \r\nbalance and mutual assistance in the activities of the \r\nAgency with respect to budgetary matters. Any attempt \r\nto reduce the technical cooperation programme or its \r\nbudget will not be favourably received. We hope that \r\nfunding resources will be predictable, safe and exact, \r\nand that there will be some increase in the regular \r\nbudget so as to reduce the gap between resources and \r\nneeds. We hope that the working group responsible for \r\nthe budget, which began its work earlier this year, will \r\nbe successful.\r\nThe use of new technology, along with developments \r\nin the area of food security, disease prevention and \r\nbiomedical management, should bring benefits to all \r\npeoples of the planet. We would therefore like to thank \r\nthe IAEA and its technical cooperation programme for \r\ntheir training and development programmes for Arab \r\ncountries and Asia. The implementation rate of those \r\nprogrammes in Iraq is approaching 100 per cent.\r\nWith a view to reducing radioactive waste, we \r\nhave been working for seven years with experts from \r\nthe IAEA and friendly countries, including European \r\nUnion countries, to dismantle nuclear sites built by \r\nthe previous Iraqi nuclear programme. Despite the \r\ndifficulties we have experienced with respect to security \r\nand the environment, considerable progress has been \r\nmade in that area, The installations at Tuwaitha have \r\nbeen decommissioned, and we have an action plan \r\nagreed with the Agency for the remaining installations. \r\nOur Government is committed to improving security \r\nmeasures to spare future generations the effects of \r\nnuclear pollution from destroyed sites or the remnants \r\nof the 1991 and 2003 wars. All of the measures \r\nadopted have followed IAEA guidelines. We have also \r\nestablished a national commission to develop an overall \r\nstrategy for managing nuclear waste, and we hope to be \r\nable to dispose of all such waste in a safe way.\r\nWe are also working on the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy with a view to harnessing it for medical, \r\nagricultural, industrial and environmental projects, \r\nand we call on the Agency to provide further assistance \r\nto Iraq in those areas. We reiterate that Iraq requires \r\ninternational support to decontaminate its environment. \r\nIraqi national institutions are also assessing the \r\ndangers of terrorist groups acquiring access to nuclear \r\ninstallations and material. That is being monitored by \r\nour national centre, which is headed by the Cabinet of \r\nMinisters.\r\nIraqi institutions are continuing their efforts to \r\nensure the security and safety of our nuclear activities \r\nin accordance with our laws and executive powers. \r\nOn 7 July, Iraq became a party to the Convention on \r\nthe Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. We have \r\nalso ratified the International Convention for the \r\nSuppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. We have \r\nprepared a draft law to ratify the Convention on Nuclear \r\nSafety and the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent \r\nFuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive \r\nWaste Management, which will be submitted to the \r\nParliament. In discussions with the Agency, we have \r\n6/11 14-60259\r\nA/69/PV.38 03/11/2014\r\ndeveloped our nuclear safety and security programme \r\nwith a view to better protecting the safety of our \r\nnuclear installations and nuclear material, as well as to \r\ngathering information and necessary data in that area. \r\nWe have also made much progress towards ensuring \r\nthat we have a national system for the management of \r\ndual-use and sensitive material subject to international \r\nconventions.\r\nWe reiterate the importance of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. It is vital that \r\nthe parties to the Treaty submit their installations to \r\ninspection by the Agency. We also stress the need to \r\nimplement Security Council resolution 487 (1981), \r\nwhich calls on Israel to put all its nuclear installations \r\nunder the Agency’s safeguards system, along with \r\nparagraph 14 of Council resolution 687 (1991), calling for \r\na nuclear-weapon-free zone and a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction in the Middle East. We stress as \r\nwell the need to implement the Final Document of the \r\n1995 NPT Review Conference and the decision taken in \r\n2010 to implement the 1995 resolution on establishing a \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East. \r\nRegarding nuclear security, we pay tribute to \r\nthe leading role being played by the IAEA and wish \r\nit success in implementing the Nuclear Security Plan \r\n2014-2017.\r\nThe past three months have revealed a great deal \r\nabout terrorist organizations and their activities. \r\nThat has led the international community to reassess \r\nthe threat to international peace and security that \r\nsuch groups represent and to adopt Security Council \r\nresolutions whose implementation requires coordinated \r\nefforts at the international level to combat terrorism \r\nand to limit the sources of funding of such groups \r\nand to combat their access to resources and weapons. \r\nWe salute the efforts of the five permanent members \r\nof the Security Council and the European Union to \r\nestablish an international alliance to combat terrorist \r\norganizations.\r\nMs. Bila (Ukraine): Ukraine supports the activities \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nin promoting the use of nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes. We also take a positive view of the Agency’s \r\nactivities in all the main statutory areas: nuclear \r\nsafety and security; nuclear science, technology and \r\napplications; and safeguards and nuclear verification. \r\nThe Agency makes a significant contribution to the \r\nachievement of global development goals.\r\nWe acknowledge the Agency’s central role in \r\nstrengthening the global nuclear safety framework, \r\nparticularly in the light of the accidents at the Chernobyl \r\nand Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plants. Ukraine \r\nconsiders it important to ensure that the development \r\nand use of nuclear energy takes place under strict safety \r\nand security conditions. We have a solid track record on \r\nmaintaining safety and security at our nuclear facilities. \r\nAll of our nuclear power plants are currently operating \r\nin regular mode, and we are in full compliance with our \r\nobligations under the Convention on Nuclear Safety, as \r\nwas recently confirmed at the Sixth Review Meeting of \r\nthe Contracting Parties to the Convention.\r\nWe reiterate our strong support for the Agency’s \r\ntechnical cooperation programme. Ukraine values \r\nthe Programme’s in the responsible development of \r\npeaceful applications of nuclear technology in the \r\nareas of human health, food and agriculture, water \r\nmanagement and strengthening nuclear and radiation \r\nsafety. It serves as a powerful tool for the exchange \r\nof nuclear knowledge and capacity-building among \r\nmember States. \r\nThe IAEA’s regional and national technical \r\ncooperation projects have contributed significantly \r\nto nuclear safety and to improving the overall \r\neffectiveness of the peaceful uses of nuclear energy \r\nin Ukraine. In 2014 and 2015 Ukraine has continued \r\nand will continue to work with the IAEA in areas such \r\nas radioactive waste management and nuclear power \r\nplant decommissioning; developing decontamination, \r\nrecultivation and reconstruction infrastructure for \r\nexisting uranium mines and former uranium production \r\nfacilities; defining safety goals and regulatory \r\nstrategies for nuclear power plants; and strengthening \r\nour radiation therapy dosimetry laboratory.\r\nMinimizing the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\naccident, as well as the social and economic \r\nrehabilitation of territories contaminated by it, is a \r\npriority for the Government of Ukraine. Construction \r\nof a new safe confinement over the destroyed unit 4 of \r\nthe Chernobyl nuclear power plant is currently under \r\nway, with completion planned for 2015. It will enable us \r\nto transform the object shelter into an environmentally \r\nand ecologically safe system. We continue to back \r\nongoing regional projects for Europe within the IAEA’s \r\ntechnical cooperation programme aimed at supporting a \r\nreturn to normal radiological environmental conditions \r\nfor the areas affected by the Chernobyl accident as well \r\n14-60259 7/11\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.38\r\nas decommissioning and waste management for the \r\nChernobyl and A1 nuclear power plants.\r\nNuclear security is an important and integral part \r\nof the Agency’s activity. Ukraine commends it for its \r\nwork to assist States, at their request, in enhancing \r\ntheir national nuclear and radioactive security regimes \r\nand improving their physical protection of nuclear \r\nmaterials. We would like to emphasize the IAEA’s \r\nimportant role in fostering international cooperation in \r\nthat area. Ukraine welcomes the IAEA’s adoption of its \r\nNuclear Security Plan 2014-2017. \r\nProceeding from the understanding that the \r\nresponsibility for nuclear security rests with individual \r\nStates, Ukraine wishes to emphasize that all of its \r\nnuclear facilities are operating in regular mode. \r\nThe relevant Ukrainian authorities have undertaken \r\nadditional effective measures to ensure their nuclear \r\nsecurity, including the reinforced physical protection of \r\n15 power units in operation at four nuclear power plant \r\nsites.\r\nUkraine is fully committed to participating in \r\neffective multilateral action aimed at combating the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \r\nconsiders the universalization of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to be of the \r\nutmost importance. We stress the paramount importance \r\nof the IAEA safeguards for providing effective control \r\nover sensitive materials and activities. The Agency’s \r\nsystem of safeguards is a fundamental component of \r\nthe global nuclear non-proliferation regime. We believe \r\nthat, taken together, the comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreement and its additional protocol constitute the best \r\nstandard for verification and that universal adherence \r\nto both instruments strengthens the global nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime.\r\nUkraine supports the Agency’s efforts to improve \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of its safeguards \r\nsystem. We have taken note of the Director General’s \r\nreport in the Supplementary Document to the Report on \r\nthe Conceptualization and Development of Safeguards \r\nImplementation at the State Level, and we commend \r\nthe Agency’s work aimed at further supporting the \r\neffective application of safeguards and expanding the \r\npossibility of accomplishing new tasks related to the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear technologies.\r\nUkraine does not recognize the illegitimately \r\nproclaimed Republic of Crimea or its illegal annexation \r\nas a constituent entity by the Russian Federation. \r\nUkraine’s sovereignty, political independence, unity \r\nand territorial integrity were emphasized in resolution \r\n68/262, on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, adopted \r\non 27 March. The Russian Federation’s illegal actions \r\nhave violated the universally recognized principles and \r\nnorms of international law, Russia’s obligations under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and the bilateral and \r\nmultilateral treaties guaranteeing Ukraine’s sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity and the inviolability of its \r\nborders.\r\nThe Russian Federation has f lagrantly violated the \r\nsecurity assurances that it, together with the United \r\nStates and the United Kingdom, provided to Ukraine in \r\nthe memorandum signed in connection with Ukraine’s \r\naccession to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. The ongoing occupation of part \r\nof Ukraine’s territory – the Autonomous Republic of \r\nCrimea and the city of Sevastopol, where Ukrainian \r\nnuclear facilities and material are located — undermines \r\nthe non-proliferation regime established by the Treaty, \r\nto which Ukraine acceded as a non-nuclear-weapon \r\nState by accepting, pursuant to article III of the Treaty, \r\nthe safeguards defined in the safeguards agreement and \r\nadditional protocol between Ukraine and the IAEA.\r\nIn that connection, the Ukrainian side emphasizes, \r\nfirst, that according to the Constitution of Ukraine and \r\nUkraine’s law on securing the rights and freedoms \r\nof citizens and the legal regime in the temporarily \r\noccupied territory of Ukraine, Ukraine’s sovereignty \r\nextends throughout its entire territory, which is \r\nindivisible and inviolable within its existing borders. \r\nSecondly, Ukraine retains jurisdiction over all \r\nnuclear facilities and materials - including the DR-\r\n100 research reactor and other nuclear facilities at the \r\nSevastopol National University for Nuclear Energy and \r\nIndustry — which are the property of Ukraine and are \r\nlocated in the temporarily occupied territory. Thirdly, \r\nthe provisions of the safeguards agreement between \r\nUkraine and the IAEA in connection with the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons remain \r\nfully effective and apply to all of the nuclear facilities \r\nand materials in Ukraine, including those located in \r\nthe temporarily occupied territory of the Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. Ukraine \r\nsupports the IAEA’s principled position on continuing \r\nto apply the safeguards to Ukrainian nuclear facilities \r\nand materials, in accordance with the norms of \r\ninternational law and the IAEA Statute and based on \r\nthe fact that the Autonomous Republic of Crimea is an \r\nintegral part of Ukraine.\r\n8/11 14-60259\r\nA/69/PV.38 03/11/2014\r\nI would like to emphasize that Ukraine prohibits \r\nthroughout its territory — including the temporarily \r\noccupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city \r\nof Sevastopol — the deployment of nuclear weapons and \r\ndiversion of Ukrainian nuclear materials and facilities \r\nfor military purposes, including the DR-100 research \r\nreactor and other nuclear facilities of the Sevastopol \r\nNational University for Nuclear Energy and Industry. \r\nWe therefore urge the Russian side to abstain from any \r\nactions that might lead to violations of the nuclear-free \r\nstatus of the part of Ukraine’s territory occupied by the \r\nRussian Federation and might hamper the possibility of \r\nextending to Ukraine’s nuclear facilities and materials \r\nthe 21 February 1985 agreement between the former \r\nSoviet Union and the Agency and its additional protocol \r\nof 22 March 2000, .\r\nThe Fukushima Daiichi accident in 2011 resulted in \r\nwidespread concern about the safety of nuclear power \r\nplants worldwide and triggered discussions about \r\nthe feasibility of nuclear energy as a source of power \r\ngeneration. We would like to reiterate that nuclear \r\npower will continue to be an important component of \r\nUkraine’s energy strategy in the middle and long term \r\nand will continue to serve as a basis for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our national economy. Its growing \r\nimportance has been reflected in the updated energy \r\nstrategy of Ukraine for the period until 2030.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to join other \r\ndelegations in welcoming the IAEA report to the sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly (see A/69/255) \r\nand to express our appreciation for the work done by \r\nthe Agency.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): I would like to begin by \r\nexpressing my delegation’s sincere thanks to the Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) for presenting the Agency’s comprehensive \r\nannual report (see A/69/255) and for his statement \r\n(see A/69/PV.37), both of which contain important \r\ninformation about the activities of the Agency during \r\n2013 and 2014. We look forward to continuing to work \r\nclosely with Ambassador Amano and to strengthening \r\nthe established cooperation between Indonesia and \r\nthe IAEA.\r\nThe IAEA has a vital role to play in assisting \r\nand promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear science \r\nand technology, especially in developing countries, \r\nincluding Indonesia. For Indonesia, nuclear technology \r\nis a valuable tool for addressing many aspects of our \r\nnational development programmes, particularly in the \r\nareas of health, food and agriculture, water resources \r\nmanagement, environmental protection and industry. \r\nAmong the applications for ensuring food security \r\nand improving people’s livelihoods, Indonesia has \r\nbeen using radiation-induced mutation and other \r\nnuclear and radioisotope techniques to increase crop \r\nquality and productivity. We are also enhancing \r\nirradiation technology applications for the sanitary and \r\nphytosanitary treatment of agricultural products.\r\nWe continue to have great confidence in the \r\nusefulness of nuclear technologies and the synergies \r\nfostered by international cooperation in the nuclear \r\nfield, for which the work of the IAEA is critical. \r\nIndonesia commends the Agency’s various activities in \r\nthe field of applying nuclear technology to the areas \r\nof food security and agriculture, disease prevention \r\nand control, water resources and environmental \r\nmanagement, and radioisotope and radiation technology. \r\nWe also commend the progress made by the Agency in \r\nnuclear energy development and welcome the assistance \r\nprovided to member States interested in launching and \r\nexpanding nuclear power programmes.\r\nOwing to the growth of the industrial sector in \r\nIndonesia, there is increasing demand for energy. We \r\nare determined to harness nuclear energy as part of \r\nthe national energy mix in order to secure our energy \r\nsupply, and we intend to introduce nuclear power plants \r\nfor that purpose. We are especially thankful to the \r\nIAEA for providing Indonesia with technical assistance \r\nin infrastructure development, which is one of the \r\nimportant steps in the introduction of nuclear power \r\nplants. Indeed, the IAEA Department of Technical \r\nCooperation plays an indispensable role as the Agency’s \r\nmain vehicle for delivering on the Agency’s mandate \r\nto promote the peaceful uses of nuclear technology, \r\nespecially in the developing regions of the world. There \r\nis a need for all of us to continue supporting the IAEA’s \r\nresources for technical cooperation.\r\nEnsuring that nuclear science and technology are \r\nused exclusively for peaceful purposes is a statutory \r\nfunction of the Agency. We therefore appreciate \r\nthe IAEA’s activities to verify that States are fully \r\ncomplying with their non-proliferation obligations \r\nand to confirm that nuclear material is being used for \r\npeaceful purposes. We are convinced that the Agency’s \r\nsafeguards have contributed to strengthening collective \r\nsecurity and have helped to create an environment \r\nconducive to nuclear cooperation.\r\n14-60259 9/11\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.38\r\nWith respect to the IAEA’s function in the area \r\nof nuclear safety, Indonesia welcomes its activities \r\nundertaken to establish safety standards. We recognize \r\nthe Agency’s central role in promoting international \r\ncooperation, coordinating international efforts to \r\nstrengthen global nuclear safety, and providing \r\nexpertise and advice in that field. We also welcome \r\nthe progress made on the implementation of the IAEA \r\nAction Plan on Nuclear Safety. While the primary \r\nresponsibility for nuclear safety is in the hands of each \r\nState, we believe that the IAEA’s role in assuring the \r\nsafety of all nuclear activities worldwide should be \r\nenhanced and strengthened to the extent mandated by \r\nits Statute.\r\nTurning to the Agency’s activities in the area of \r\nnuclear security, our view is that while the responsibility \r\nof ensuring nuclear security within a State lies primarily \r\nwith its Government, international cooperation and \r\ncoordination to ensure nuclear security worldwide are \r\ncrucial, and the IAEA again has a central role to play \r\nin that regard. We are pleased that the IAEA has helped \r\ncountries to reduce the risk of terrorists obtaining \r\nnuclear or radioactive materials and to prevent sabotage \r\nat nuclear facilities.\r\nTo conclude, we reiterate our appreciation of the \r\nIAEA, as its activities have greatly contributed to a \r\nmore prosperous, secure and safe world. The IAEA \r\nneeds our continued and strong support for fulfilling \r\nthe mandate enshrined in its Statute, and Indonesia will \r\ncontinue to play its role in that regard.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 86. We shall now \r\nproceed to consider draft resolution A/69/L.7.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the vote, may I remind delegations that \r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. An Myong Hun (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to state its position on \r\ndraft resolution A/69/L.7, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”. This statement \r\nwill also constitute my delegation’s reply to irrelevant \r\nand even hostile statements made by some delegations, \r\nincluding those of Japan and South Korea, concerning \r\nthe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The \r\ndelegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea rejects those statements and therefore also rejects \r\nthe draft resolution.\r\nThe possession of nuclear deterrence by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is the result of \r\nthe hostility of the United States against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, which is why the solution \r\nto the nuclear issue depends entirely on the withdrawal \r\nof the United States’ hostile policy. Nevertheless, the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) submits \r\nevery year to the General Assembly the same partial \r\nand unjust resolution, in step with the hostile policy \r\nof the United States, designed to disarm and destroy \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Since the \r\nIAEA’s action is devoid of impartiality and objectivity, \r\nit has lost its integrity.\r\nIt was the United States and the IAEA that created \r\nsuspicions about our peaceful nuclear facilities, and \r\nit was also they who forced my country to take self-\r\ndefensive measures to withdraw from the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We have never \r\nrecognized the resolutions of the Security Council and \r\nthe Board of Governors of the IAEA on the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. As we have made clear, the \r\nnuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is the product of \r\nthe United States’ hostile policy and its nuclear threats \r\nagainst my country, and we were compelled to possess \r\nnuclear deterrence in order to defend our sovereignty \r\nand right to exist.\r\nAs long as the United States hostile policy persists, \r\npeace and security on the Korean peninsula and in \r\nits surrounding region cannot be expected, nor can a \r\nsolution to the nuclear issue. The hostile policy of the \r\nUnited States, including the aggressive joint military \r\nexercises against the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, must be totally eliminated if the danger of \r\nnuclear war is to be removed from the Korean peninsula.\r\nIf the United States continues to threaten and \r\nblackmail the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nwith nuclear weapons, we will continue to exercise \r\nthe right to self-defence by strengthening our nuclear \r\ndeterrence capabilities. If the IAEA wants to see a \r\nproper solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula, it must take a fair stance by questioning the \r\nmove of the United States, which created the nuclear \r\nissue on the Korean peninsula and continues to threaten \r\nmy country with nuclear weapons.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\ndelegation wishes to again put on record its \r\n10/11 14-60259\r\nA/69/PV.38 03/11/2014\r\nopposition to draft resolution A/69/L.7 concerning the \r\nIAEA report.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote before the vote.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.7, entitled “Report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should \r\nlike to announce that since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, in addition to those delegations listed in the \r\ndocument, the following countries have also become \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/69/L.7: Colombia, \r\nIceland, Liechtenstein, the Republic of Moldova, the \r\nRussian Federation and San Marino.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.7?\r\nDraft resolution A/69/L.7 was adopted \r\n(resolution 69/7).\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on those \r\nrepresentatives who have requested to speak in \r\nexercise the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMrs. Jakubonė (Lithuania): Lithuania exercises \r\nits right of reply with regard to the statement delivered \r\nby the representative of Belarus (see A/69/PV.37). \r\nCountries developing new nuclear energy projects are \r\nexpected to follow the principles of transparency and \r\nresponsibility. Each country has the right to develop \r\nnuclear energy, provided that international obligations \r\non nuclear safety are not forgotten and national \r\ndecisions are taken in a broader context of possible \r\ntransboundary implications. That is why we express \r\nour concern when nuclear energy installations in closed \r\nneighbourhoods are being constructed without the \r\nproper implementation of international conventions, \r\nnuclear safety standards and dialogue with neighbours. \r\nThe lack of transparency and essential information, \r\nespecially on site selection, seismic evaluation and \r\nemergency preparedness plans, are disturbing.\r\nConfidence-building and maximum safety are crucial \r\nfor nuclear energy development. The implementation of \r\nthe safety standards of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), adherence to the Convention on \r\nNuclear Safety and cooperation with specialized IAEA \r\nmissions for the whole nuclear fuel cycle, including site \r\nsafety, should become inseparable from any nuclear \r\npower programme. Therefore, acknowledging that it \r\nis our common interest to ensure a maximum safety \r\nlevel in nuclear power plants, we call on all countries \r\nimplementing nuclear energy projects to use the \r\ninstruments provided by the IAEA and international \r\nconventions from the very beginning of the project in \r\norder to guarantee a safe environment and the safe use \r\nof nuclear energy.\r\nMr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFrankly, we are amazed that the Ukrainian delegation \r\nhas once again used any available opportunity presented \r\nby the United Nations platform for its rhetoric and \r\ninsinuations and for raising issues that are not relevant \r\nto the agenda item. I do not wish to enter into polemics, \r\nbut I need to make a few comments with regard to the \r\nstatus of nuclear installations in Crimea.\r\nThe agreement of 21 February 1985 between the \r\nSoviet Union and the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency and its additional protocol of 22 March 2000 \r\nhave covered all the territory of the Republic of Crimea \r\nand the city of Sevastopol as subjects of the Russian \r\nFederation since 18 March. Russia, acting in a spirit \r\nof openness and cooperation, has worked with the \r\nSecretariat of the IAEA on the status of the nuclear \r\ninstallations in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol \r\nand on establishing peaceful conditions in which IAEA \r\nsafeguards can be possible, in accordance with the \r\nagreement between us and the IAEA. Therefore, the \r\nsituation is fully in line with international law.\r\nSecondly, according to the voluntary decision of the \r\npeople of Crimea to unite with Russia, in the referendum \r\nof 16 March, which was carried out in accordance with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, and the agreement \r\nof 18 March to absorb Crimea into the Russian \r\nFederation, the territory of the Republic of Crimea \r\nand the city of Sevastopol are under the jurisdiction \r\nof the Russian Federation. Therefore, Russia has taken \r\nfull responsibility for nuclear installations in its new \r\nterritories. Furthermore, the Russian Federation is \r\nready to provide the Agency, if it so requests, with any \r\ninformation on the nuclear material being used. That is \r\n14-60259 11/11\r\n03/11/2014 A/69/PV.38\r\nall provided for in the agreement between the Union of \r\nSoviet Socialist Republics and the IAEA of 1985.\r\nRegarding the suggestion that the actions of \r\nthe Russian Federation highlight the instability of \r\nthe whole concept of negative safety guarantees for \r\nnon-nuclear States and thereby destroy the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime,  it is worth noting that the \r\nonly common component of the Budapest Memorandum \r\nand the concept of negative guarantees in the classical \r\nmeaning is the commitment not to use nuclear weapons \r\nor threaten to use them against non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates. The Russian Federation’s promise to Ukraine in \r\nthat regard has in no way been violated. The remaining \r\ncommitments under the Budapest Memorandum \r\nrepresent the principles of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe and have nothing to do \r\nwith the concept of negative safeguards in particular \r\nor with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons in general. Therefore, claims that the actions \r\nof the Russian Federation undermine the nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime are inconsistent and not in \r\ngood faith.\r\nMs. Bila (Ukraine): I am not going to get into a \r\nlong speech to explain how what has just been said are \r\nlies. I will briefly explain that the agreement between \r\nUkraine and the International Atomic Energy Agency is \r\nthe main document regulating and providing safeguards \r\nrelating to objects located on the occupied territory, and \r\nthat was determined by the territory. Therefore, it is not \r\nfor anyone in this Hall to speak about any documents \r\nbetween Russia and the Agency concerning objects that \r\nare on Ukrainian territory.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 86?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.15 p.m.\r\n"
