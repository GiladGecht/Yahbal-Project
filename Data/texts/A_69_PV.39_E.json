Document A/69/230 contains a memorandum \r\nby the Secretary-General on the current composition \r\nof the Court and on the procedures to be followed in \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council with \r\nregard to the election. Document A/69/253 contains the \r\nlist of candidates nominated by national groups.

According to Article 2 of \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.39\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n39th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 6 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Article \r\n9 requires electors to bear in mind not only that the \r\nperson to be elected should individually possess the \r\nqualifications required, but also that in the body as a \r\nwhole, representation of the main forms of civilization \r\nand of the principal legal systems of the world should \r\nbe assured.\r\nIn accordance with Article 10, paragraph 1, of the \r\nStatute of the Court, those candidates who obtain an \r\nabsolute majority of votes both in the General Assembly \r\nand in the Security Council shall be considered as \r\nelected. The consistent practice of the United Nations \r\nhas been to interpret the words “absolute majority” as \r\nmeaning a majority of all electors, whether or not they \r\nvote or are allowed to vote. The electors in the General \r\nAssembly are all 193 Member States. Accordingly, for \r\nthe purposes of the present election, 97 votes constitute \r\nan absolute majority in the General Assembly.\r\nOnly those candidates whose names appear on the \r\nballot papers are eligible for election. The electors in \r\nthe General Assembly will indicate the candidates for \r\nwhom they wish to vote by placing crosses against their \r\nnames on the ballot papers. Each elector may vote for \r\nnot more than five candidates on the first ballot and, \r\non subsequent ballots, if any, for five candidates, less \r\nthe number of candidates who have already obtained \r\nabsolute majorities.\r\nAt the 915th plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly, on 16 November 1960, a procedural discussion \r\nwas held as to whether rule 94 — then rule 96 — of the \r\nrules of procedure of the Assembly should be applied \r\nin elections to the International Court of Justice. That \r\nrule lays down a procedure for restricted ballots in the \r\nevent that, after the first ballot, the requisite number \r\nof candidates have not obtained the required majority. \r\nBy 47 votes to 27, with 25 abstentions, the Assembly \r\ndecided that the rule did not apply to elections to the \r\nCourt and proceeded to elect the requisite number of \r\ncandidates by a series of unrestricted ballots. That \r\ndecision has been followed consistently.\r\nAccordingly, pursuant to rule 151 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Assembly, if in the first ballot in the \r\nGeneral Assembly the number of candidates obtaining \r\nan absolute majority is less than five, a second ballot \r\nwill be held on the remaining candidates and balloting \r\nwill continue at the same meeting until five candidates \r\nhave obtained the required majority. However, if in the \r\nfirst or subsequent ballots more than five candidates \r\nobtain an absolute majority, the General Assembly shall \r\nfollow the established practice and proceed to a new \r\nvote on all the candidates. Balloting will continue in the \r\nsame manner until five of the candidates have obtained \r\nthe required majority. Only when five candidates have \r\nobtained the required majority in the Assembly will the \r\nPresident of the Assembly notify the President of the \r\nSecurity Council of the names of the five candidates.\r\nIn accordance with Article 11 of the Statute, if \r\nupon comparison of the respective lists of names that \r\nhave obtained an absolute majority in the General \r\nAssembly and in the Security Council fewer than five \r\ncandidates have been thus elected, the Assembly and \r\nthe Council will proceed, again independently of one \r\nanother, at a second meeting — and, if necessary, a \r\nthird — to elect candidates by further ballots for seats \r\nremaining vacant, the results again being compared \r\nafter the required number of candidates have obtained \r\nan absolute majority in each organ.\r\nIf, however, after the third meeting one or more \r\nseats still remain unfilled, the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council may at any time, at the request \r\nof either organ, form a joint conference consisting of \r\nsix members, three appointed by each organ. That joint \r\nconference may, by an absolute majority, agree on one \r\nname for each seat still vacant and submit the name \r\nor names for the acceptance of the Assembly and the \r\nCouncil. If the joint conference is unanimously agreed, \r\nit may submit the name of a person not included in the \r\nlist of nominations, provided that candidate fulfils the \r\nrequired conditions, in accordance with Article 12, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Statute.\r\nIf the joint conference is satisfied that it will not be \r\nsuccessful in procuring an election, those members of \r\nthe Court who have already been elected shall, within \r\na period to be fixed by the Security Council, proceed \r\nto fill the vacant seat or seats by selection from among \r\nthose candidates who have obtained votes either in \r\nthe General Assembly or in the Security Council. In \r\naccordance with paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 12 of the \r\nStatute, in the event of an equality of votes among the \r\njudges, the eldest shall have a casting vote.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthose procedures at this election?\r\n14-60970 3/7\r\n06/11/2014 A/69/PV.39\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to remind \r\nrepresentatives that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure,\r\n“After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting”.\r\nAny announcements, including those concerning \r\nwithdrawals of candidatures, should therefore be made \r\nprior to the commencement of the voting process, that \r\nis to say, before the announcement of the beginning of \r\nthe voting process.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection. Please be reminded that during the voting \r\nprocess all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. That means in particular that once the \r\nelection has begun, no more campaign material can \r\nbe distributed inside the Hall. All representatives are \r\nalso requested to remain at their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank \r\nmembers for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nBallot papers will be given only to the \r\nrepresentatives seated directly behind country name \r\nplates. Representatives are requested to use only \r\nthe ballot papers now being distributed. Only those \r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers \r\nare eligible. Representatives will indicate the five \r\ncandidates for whom they wish to vote by placing \r\ncrosses to the left of their names on the ballot papers. \r\nBallot papers on which more than five names are \r\nmarked will be considered invalid. Votes may be cast \r\nonly for those whose names appear on the ballot papers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Mansouri \r\n(Algeria), Ms. Mohd Salleh (Brunei Darussalam), \r\nMr. Ona Garcés (Ecuador), Mr. Stefanik (Poland), \r\nMs. Lyngdorf (Sweden) and Mr. do Carmo Vieira \r\n(Timor-Leste) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.25 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  1\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMs. Joan E.
