The Assembly \r\nwill now proceed to vote with respect to the remaining \r\nvacancy.\r\nI should like to remind representatives that, \r\npursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure,\r\n“After the President has announced the \r\nbeginning of voting, no representative shall \r\ninterrupt the voting except on a point of order in \r\nconnection with the actual conduct of the voting.”\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers will now be distributed.\r\nAll the candidates whose names appear on the ballot \r\npaper are eligible. I would like to remind delegations \r\nthat the name of only one candidate should be marked \r\nwith a cross. Any ballot paper on which more than one \r\nname is marked will be considered invalid. Votes may \r\nbe cast only for those whose names appear on the ballot \r\npapers.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Ms. Mansouri \r\n(Algeria), Ms. Mohd Salleh (Brunei Darussalam), \r\nMr. Ona Garcés (Ecuador), Mr. Stefanik (Poland), \r\nMs. Lyngdorf (Sweden) and Mr. do Carmo Vieira \r\n(Timor-Leste) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.30 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.05 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions: 0\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Patrick Lipton Robinson (Jamaica) 115\r\nMs. Susana Ruiz Cerutti (Argentina)  77\r\nMr. Patrick Lipton Robinson has obtained an \r\nabsolute majority in the General Assembly.\r\nI have communicated the result of the voting to the \r\nPresident of the Security Council.\r\nI have also received a letter from the President of \r\nthe Security Council, which reads:\r\n“I have the honour to inform you that at the \r\n7298th meeting of the Security Council, held on \r\n7 November 2014, for the purpose of electing one \r\nmember of the International Court of Justice for \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.40\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n40th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 7 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n2/2 14-61071\r\nA/69/PV.40 07/11/2014\r\na term of office beginning on 6 February 2015, \r\nMs. Susana Ruiz Cerutti obtained an absolute \r\nmajority of votes.”\r\nWe therefore do not have a match between our \r\ndecision here and that of the Security Council. As a \r\nresult of the voting that has taken place independently \r\nin the General Assembly and the Security Council, no \r\ncandidate has obtained an absolute majority in both \r\nbodies. In accordance with the provisions of Article 11 \r\nof the Statute of the Court, it will therefore be necessary \r\nto hold another meeting to fill the remaining vacancy.\r\nI propose that the present meeting be adjourned \r\nand the 41st meeting held immediately to vote on the \r\nremaining vacancy.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.\r\n"
