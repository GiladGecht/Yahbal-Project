In accordance with \r\nthe provisions of Article 11 of the Statute of the Court, \r\nit will therefore be necessary to hold another meeting to \r\nfill the remaining vacancy.\r\nI propose that the present meeting be adjourned \r\nand the 45th meeting held immediately to vote on the \r\nremaining vacancy.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.30 p.m.\r\n"
