May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations. We shall now \r\nproceed accordingly.\r\nI should like to inform members that, as of 1 January \r\n2015, the following States from among the Group of \r\nWestern European and Other States will be represented \r\non the Economic and Social Council: Austria, France, \r\nGermany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, San Marino, Sweden, \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland and the United States of America.
