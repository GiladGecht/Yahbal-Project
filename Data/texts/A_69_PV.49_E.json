"*1462259*\r\n14-62259 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m. \r\nAgenda item 119\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters\r\nThe President: Members will recall that one of the \r\npriorities I have set for this session is advancing the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform \r\nof the Security Council. As members well know, the \r\nroad towards the reform of the Security Council has \r\nthus far been a long and winding journey. At the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit, leaders expressed support for reform of \r\nthe Council \r\n“in order to make it more broadly representative, \r\nefficient and transparent and thus to further \r\nenhance its effectiveness and the legitimacy and \r\nimplementation of its decisions” (resolution 60/1, \r\npara. 153).\r\nAt the start of this year’s session, more than 100 \r\nleaders expressed concern at the lack of progress in \r\nthe negotiations on Security Council reform 10 years \r\nsince the World Summit. We therefore need to renew \r\nthe commitment of all Member States to the reform \r\nagenda and the next phase of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Above all, we must undertake this \r\nendeavour in a steadfast state of compromise. I am \r\noptimistic that today’s debate will provide a clearer \r\npicture of the challenges we have to surmount and the \r\nopportunities that we must then harness to advance the \r\nreform process. Although the task may seem daunting, \r\ntogether we can make progress on this critical \r\nundertaking.\r\nSince the founding of the Organization nearly \r\n70 years ago, the world has undergone profound change. \r\nThe challenges we face have become more complex \r\ngiven the wide range of new and emerging threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. We therefore need to \r\nreform the Security Council, in particular to make it \r\nmore representative, effective and efficient. Indeed, our \r\nOrganization should continue to adapt to the constructs \r\nand exigencies of our present-day world in order to \r\nbe effective and relevant. It is therefore in the bests \r\ninterests of all Member States to take the necessary \r\nsteps to reform the Security Council so as to preserve \r\nits fundamental role in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security for generations to come.\r\nAs the reform discussions move forward, it is \r\nimportant to ensure that they are not a mere repetition \r\nof previously stated positions — a dynamic that has \r\ncharacterized the intergovernmental negotiation process \r\nin the past. What is now required is a firm commitment \r\nto moving the process to text-based negotiation on all \r\nclusters. The mandate for negotiations firmly belongs \r\nto all the Member States. It is my hope that today’s \r\ndebate will serves as a useful foundation for future \r\nreform and galvanize productive negotiations over the \r\ncoming months.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative of \r\nAfghanistan, for spearheading the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations for the past years. As representatives \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.49\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n49th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 12 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

We must \r\ncollectively move the negotiation process forward, \r\nas that effort is important not only for ensuring the \r\neffective functioning of the Security Council, but also \r\nfor preserving its legitimacy.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (NAM). \r\nI would like to thank you, Mr. President, for \r\norganizing this debate. We express our appreciation \r\nto Ambassador John Ashe, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-eighth session, and Ambassador \r\nTanin, former Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, for their \r\nefforts. We take note of the recent oral decision of \r\nthe General Assembly on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, which will enable the continuation of the \r\nnegotiations during the sixty-ninth session.\r\nWe underscore the validity and relevance of the \r\nMovement’s principled position concerning the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council, and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council. I refer in particular to \r\nthe directives the Movement adopted at its eleventh, \r\ntwelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth \r\nsummits, which have been reflected in the Movement’s \r\nposition and negotiating papers, and to the decisions of \r\nNAM ministerial conferences and meetings.\r\nThe Movement, while appreciating the efforts \r\nundertaken so far, notes with concern the lack of \r\nimportant and concrete results during 10 rounds of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters, based on General Assembly decisions. These \r\nnegotiations have shown that while a convergence of \r\nviews has emerged, major differences persist. While \r\nsome improvements have been made to the working \r\nmethods of the Council, they have not satisfied even the \r\nminimum expectations of the general membership of the \r\nUnited Nations, leaving much room for improvement.\r\nDecision 62/557 is and will continue to be the basis \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Reform of the Security Council should \r\nbe comprehensive, addressing all substantive issues \r\nrelating to, inter alia, the question of membership, \r\nregional representation, the Council’s agenda and \r\nits working methods and decision-making process, \r\nincluding the veto. It should garner the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance of Member States, in line with \r\nthe provisions of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand relevant General Assembly decisions, particularly \r\ndecision 62/557. We are confident that those clear \r\nreferences will guide the work of Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, in his \r\nnewly assumed position as Chair of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We take this opportunity to wish him all \r\nsuccess and to assure him of NAM’s commitment to the \r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council should be \r\naddressed in an timely, comprehensive, transparent and \r\nbalanced manner, without delay and without setting \r\nartificial deadlines. It should ensure that the agenda \r\nof the Council reflects the needs and interests of \r\ndeveloping and developed countries alike in an objective, \r\nrational, non-selective and non-arbitrary manner. \r\nThe enlargement of the Council, the body primarily \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, and the reform of its working methods \r\nshould result in a democratic, more representative, \r\nmore accountable and more effective Council. The \r\nrules of procedure of the Security Council, which have \r\nremained provisional for more than 60 years, should \r\nbe formalized in order to improve its transparency and \r\naccountability.\r\nTransparency, openness and consistency are key \r\nelements that the Security Council should observe \r\nin all its activities, approaches and procedures. \r\nRegrettably, the Council has neglected those important \r\nfactors on numerous occasions. Such instances include \r\nunscheduled open debates with selective notification; \r\nreluctance to convene open debates on some issues of \r\nhigh significance; repeatedly restricting participation \r\nin some open debates; discriminating between \r\nmembers and non-members of the Council, particularly \r\nwith regard to sequencing and time limits on statements \r\nduring open debates; failure to submit special, \r\nanalytical reports to the General Assembly, as required \r\nunder Article 24 of the Charter; the submission of \r\nannual reports still lacking sufficient information and \r\nanalytical content; and lack of minimal parameters for \r\nthe elaboration of the monthly assessment of Security \r\nCouncil presidencies.\r\n14-62259 3/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nIn recent years, the Security Council has been too \r\nquick to threaten or authorize enforcement action in \r\nsome cases, while being silent and inactive in others. \r\nFurthermore, the Council has increasingly resorted to \r\nChapter VII of the Charter as an umbrella for addressing \r\nissues that do not necessarily pose an immediate threat \r\nto international peace and security. A careful review of \r\nthose trends indicates that the Council could have opted \r\nfor alternative provisions to respond more appropriately \r\nin particular cases. Instead of excessive and premature \r\nresort to Chapter VII, efforts should be made to fully \r\nutilize the provisions of Chapters VI and VIII for the \r\npacific settlement of disputes. Chapter VII should \r\nbe invoked as a measure of last resort, as intended. \r\nUnfortunately, provisions of Articles 41 and 42 have \r\nbeen too quickly resorted to in some cases, while other \r\noptions have not been fully explored and exhausted.\r\nSecurity Council-imposed sanctions remain an \r\nissue of serious concern to non-aligned countries. In \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe imposition of sanctions should be considered only \r\nafter all means of peaceful settlement of disputes under \r\nChapter VI of the Charter have been exhausted and after \r\na thorough consideration undertaken of the short-term \r\nand long-term effects of such sanctions. Sanctions are a \r\nblunt instrument, the use of which raises fundamental \r\nethical questions of whether inflicting suffering on \r\nvulnerable groups in the target country is a legitimate \r\nmeans of exerting pressure.\r\nThe objectives of sanctions are not to punish or \r\notherwise exact retribution on the populace. In that \r\nregard, the objectives of sanctions regimes should be \r\nclearly defined and their imposition should be for a \r\nspecific time frame and based on tenable legal grounds. \r\nThey should be lifted as soon as the objectives are \r\nachieved. \r\nNAM rejects the use of the Security Council as a \r\ntool to pursue national political interests and agendas, \r\nthus aggravating rather than alleviating situations, \r\ncontrary to its mission enshrined in the Charter. We \r\nstress the necessity of non-selectivity, impartiality and \r\naccountability in the work of the Council and the need \r\nfor the Council to strictly keep within the powers and \r\nfunctions accorded to it by the Member States under \r\nthe Charter.\r\nIn conclusion, I congratulate Malaysia, Angola and \r\nVenezuela as the new NAM members in the Council \r\nfor the 2015-2016 term and urge them, along with \r\nother non-aligned countries that serve in the Security \r\nCouncil, to help promote and defend the NAM positions \r\nand objectives during their tenure. I also seize this \r\nopportunity to congratulate New Zealand and Spain on \r\ntheir success in becoming new non-permanent members \r\nof the Council for the upcoming two-year term and \r\nhope that their presence in the Council will contribute \r\nto its effectiveness and efficiency in carrying out its \r\nmandate.\r\nMr. Torrington (Guyana): In today’s debate on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters, I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\n14 States members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM). \r\nCARICOM aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\nwith the statement to be delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 \r\nGroup.\r\nMr. President, at the outset CARICOM thanks \r\nyou for the high level of verity and commitment \r\naccorded to this most important of issues. Indeed, we \r\nare fully and firmly in agreement with the sentiments \r\nexpressed in your inaugural address to this session, in \r\nwhich you stated that “the need to reform the Security \r\nCouncil is urgent” (A/69/PV.1, p. 3). CARICOM thanks \r\nyou for your letter of 10 November through which \r\nyou informed us of the appointment of Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non reform of the Security Council. CARICOM views \r\nthat as a substantive and irrefutable indication of your \r\ncommitment to advancing progress on the issue, and \r\nwe offer him our full support. We take this opportunity \r\nalso to express our appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent Representative \r\nof Afghanistan, for his tireless efforts over the past \r\n10 rounds of intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nFor over two decades, the issue of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council has been debated in the Hall. Member \r\nStates have time and again expressed their varying \r\npositions on those issues. However, after all these \r\ndiscussions and after 10 rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, we have very little progress to show for our \r\nefforts. That must change, and it must change starting \r\nin the sixty-ninth session. CARICOM is of the view \r\nthat, 10 years after the Organization was mandated by \r\n4/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nHeads of State and Government to pursue early reform \r\nof the Security Council, the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe creation of this most democratic of institutions will \r\nbe an historic and timely opportunity to demonstrate \r\nthe international community’s resolve to ensure that \r\nthe United Nations and all its principal organs remain \r\nrelevant and equipped to address the multidimensional \r\nchallenges of today’s geopolitical realities.\r\nAs we chart the way forward for a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, it is fitting that at the same time \r\nwe chart the course forward for international peace and \r\nsecurity. To accomplish those ends, we must fulfil our \r\ncollective responsibility to bring about the meaningful \r\nreform that is in the best interests of the United Nations \r\nand the peoples of the world. The objective of such \r\nreform must be to make the Organization, and in \r\nparticular the Security Council — the primary organ \r\nwith the responsibility for the maintenance of peace \r\nand security in the world — more representative, \r\ndemocratic, accountable, accessible and effective.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations launched \r\nthrough decision 62/557, with much hope and \r\nexpectation for progress, provided a format through \r\nwhich Member States could negotiate the numerous \r\npositions on this important issue and, through such \r\nnegotiation, build on areas of convergence and bridge \r\nthe varying areas of divergence. Six years later, we \r\nhave seen that merely reiterating our positions does not \r\nqualify as negotiations. There has been no real give-and-\r\ntake within those 10 rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Positions have not merged or moved. Gaps \r\nhave not been narrowed and areas of commonalities \r\nhave not been grasped as building blocks towards \r\nadvancing the issue.\r\nIt is for that reason that CARICOM submits that the \r\neleventh round of intergovernmental negotiations must \r\nbe qualitatively different from the previous rounds. \r\nProgress, however little, must be achieved by the end \r\nof this session. It is therefore our expectation that the \r\nnext round of intergovernmental negotiations will be \r\nconducted on the basis of a text, in keeping with the \r\nPresident Kutesa’s encouragement expressed in his \r\n10 November letter to Member States. CARICOM \r\nexpects that such a text, which would reflect the sense \r\nof the Assembly after 10 rounds of negotiations and \r\nwhich could be used as a basis for line-by-line and \r\nparagraph-by-paragraph negotiations, will be made \r\navailable to Member States. The options must be based \r\non an objective assessment of our discussions of what \r\nhas transpired to date, and they must be presented in a \r\npractical, negotiable format in which real give-and-take \r\nnegotiations can begin.\r\nAs we chart the way forward, the basis presented \r\nmust clearly show where the varying positions of \r\nMember States converge and where gaps remain, and \r\nit must reflect the positions of all Member States, \r\nincluding of course, the majority. In that endeavour, \r\nwe assure you, Sir, of our fullest confidence in you as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and in the new Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nCARICOM has continued to remain seized at the \r\nhighest political level of the need for definitive progress \r\non this important issue, and our delegations are fully \r\ncommitted to play a constructive role in the process. \r\nAllow me therefore to reiterate briefly the position \r\nof our region on the key aspects of the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nFirst, CARICOM supports expansion in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. We call for an increase in the size of the \r\nSecurity Council membership from 15 to 27. CARICOM \r\nmaintains that the role of the developing countries \r\nshould be advanced and enhanced in both categories. \r\nIn that regard, CARICOM has been resolute in its \r\nsupport for the inclusion of Africa in the permanent \r\ncategory of membership on the Council. There cannot \r\nbe a reformed Council without Africa as a permanent \r\nand equal member. We call for the provision of a special \r\nseat for small island developing States in the reformed \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nCARICOM supports the elimination of the veto.\r\nHowever, in the event of its retention, we consider that \r\nall permanent members of a reformed Security Council \r\nmust have the same rights and privileges. We call for \r\nimproved working methods of the Council in order to \r\nincrease the involvement of non-members in its work \r\nand to enhance its accountability and transparency.\r\nWith regard to the relationship between the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly, CARICOM \r\nrecommends that appropriate measures be adopted to \r\nenable the General Assembly to function effectively as \r\nthe chief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations.\r\nTo conclude, let me assure you, Mr. President, of \r\nthe full support of the CARICOM delegations as you \r\nseek to advance the important cause of Security Council \r\nreform. A legitimate Council must be more broadly \r\n14-62259 5/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nrepresentative of twenty-first-century realities, more \r\nefficient and transparent in its work, and accountable \r\nto the general membership of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Patriota (Brazil): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Group of Four (G4) \r\ncountries: Brazil, Germany, India and Japan.\r\nI would like to start by thanking you, Sir, for \r\nyour letter of 10 November, in which you announced \r\nthe appointment of the Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, as the new \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations. Let me \r\nassure Ambassador Rattray that the G4 is encouraged \r\nby his appointment and is committed to working closely \r\nwith him with a view to achieving the much-needed and \r\nlong-awaited reform of the Security Council. Allow me \r\nto take this opportunity to thank Ambassador Zahir \r\nTanin once more for his invaluable work and tireless \r\nefforts during the past five years to move that process \r\nforward.\r\nI would also like to commend you, Mr. President, \r\nfor your strong commitment to the cause of Security \r\nCouncil reform, which is undoubtedly very clear after \r\nless than two months in office. In your capacity as \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, you have been \r\nfollowing this issue very closely for a long time, having \r\npersonally participated in the adoption of the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus. You therefore understand more than anyone \r\nelse the urgency of the matter.\r\nThe sixty-eighth session of the General \r\nAssembly brought important developments to the \r\nintergovernmental process. Former Assembly President \r\nJohn Ashe endorsed the non-paper produced by his \r\nAdvisory Group, which represents a neutral and \r\nobjective summary of the main positions expressed over \r\nthe past 20 years and is now a widely recognized tool \r\nto help frame our discussions. When we went through \r\nanother series of meetings convened by Ambassador \r\nTanin, based on the five clusters established by \r\ndecision 62/557, some convergences were clearly \r\nidentified, especially with respect to the existence of \r\na clear majority in favour of expanding both categories \r\nof membership.\r\nIn his assessment of the current state of play, \r\ncirculated to the membership on 9 July, Ambassador \r\nTanin also recognized the proactive tone and momentum \r\nachieved at the most recent session and, looking ahead, \r\nhe pointed out that a text-based discussion remains the \r\nlogical evolution for this process. That is why the G4 \r\nbelieves it is imperative to start the first meeting of the \r\nnext round of the intergovernmental negotiations with \r\na text on the table. We cannot allow the next round of \r\nthe intergovernmental process to be yet another merry-\r\ngo-round.\r\nAs for those who state that there must be a prior \r\nconsensus before presenting the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations with a working document, let me point out \r\nthat such a requirement has no precedent in any other \r\nUnited Nations process. In fact, that line of thought \r\ncould actually be considered anti-United Nations. \r\nAs a matter of fact, in his statement delivered at the \r\nmeeting on the roll-over decision held on 8 September, \r\nformer President Ashe stressed that a negotiating text \r\nneeds sufficiently wide but not necessarily universal \r\nagreement. I assure the Assembly that the G4 remains \r\nready to start real negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform at any time. Negotiations, however, do not \r\nhappen in a vacuum. Relying on your authority and \r\nmandate as President of this body, Sir, we therefore \r\nask you to empower the new Chair by yourself putting \r\nforward a negotiating text that does not prejudge any \r\npositions or outcomes.\r\nThere is a prevailing view among Member States \r\nand among civil society that the Security Council is not \r\ncapable of responding satisfactorily to specific crises \r\naround the world. One can clearly identify a growing \r\nsense of frustration arising from the paralysis in the \r\nefforts to reform it. During the last general debate, over \r\n100 delegations stressed the need for reform.\r\nLet us recall that 2015 will mark 50 years since \r\nthe first and only time that the Security Council was \r\nreformed, 15 years since the Millennium Summit and \r\n10 years since the 2005 World Summit, when world \r\nleaders unanimously called for early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. If we leave things as they are, we run \r\nthe risk of bringing discredit and erosion of authority \r\nto the United Nations in a core area of its mandate. It \r\nis time to fulfil the mandate given to us by our Heads \r\nof State and Government — a call that was reiterated \r\nby the Foreign Ministers of the G4 at their most recent \r\nmeeting, held in New York on 26 September. As the \r\nformer Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\npointed out in his aforementioned assessment, the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Organization in 2015 will \r\nprovide a “tremendous opportunity” for achieving the \r\nmuch needed reform. The G4, in close cooperation with \r\nthe rest of the membership, will keep working towards \r\nthat goal and believes it is achievable.\r\n6/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nMs. Rambally (Saint Lucia): I have the honour \r\nto take the f loor today on behalf of the L.69 Group, a \r\ndiverse group of 42 developing countries from Africa, \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific \r\nthat are united by a common cause — to achieve lasting \r\nand comprehensive reforms of the Security Council. Our \r\nGroup is bound by the firm conviction that expansion \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership of the Security Council is imperative in \r\norder to better reflect contemporary world realities and \r\nachieve a more accountable, representative, transparent \r\nand, more importantly, a relevant Security Council.\r\nLet me begin by placing on record our Group’s \r\nappreciation of Ambassador Tanin for leading the \r\nprocess thus far. We are heartened by the strong \r\nemphasis and high priority that you, Sir, attach to \r\nthis long-debated subject, and we compliment you \r\non appointing Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to lead us forward on \r\nthis important debate. His appointment is a welcome \r\ndevelopment, as it brings not only fresh leadership but, \r\nwe hope, increased momentum through innovative \r\nideas to what has been largely a stalled process to date.\r\nAfter 10 rounds and seven years of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, nothing has changed on this subject \r\nexcept for the efforts made by the leadership of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which has done its utmost on the \r\nissue. The intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform were mandated to commence text-\r\nbased negotiations. As many as 140 countries — far \r\nmore than two-thirds majority — made a formal and \r\nwritten submission to the Chair in 2009 asking him \r\nto initiate a text-based negotiation process. However, \r\nwe have been repeatedly airing statements of known \r\npositions and we continue to call upon the Chair to \r\nconduct negotiations on the basis of a text, an approach \r\nin keeping with requests to all other chairs in all other \r\nUnited Nations processes. This request is consistent \r\nwith what we know to be United Nations practice.\r\nWith the seventieth anniversary year of the United \r\nNations approaching, it simply cannot therefore \r\nbe business as usual. We cannot embark upon the \r\nnext round of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform with the same stasis and \r\nvacuum that has characterized the last 10 rounds. The \r\nprocess will only move forward if you, Sir, as the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, mandate the Chair \r\nto conduct negotiations at the soonest on the basis of a \r\ntext that is tabled with your full authority and backing. \r\nHowever, if we allow the self-defeating argument of \r\nconsensus to emerge even before the commencement \r\nof negotiations as a precondition for commencing text-\r\nbased negotiations, then we are simply trying to stall \r\nany forward movement on the process, which only suits \r\nthe interests of a limited minority of objectors.\r\nWe therefore count and call upon your leadership, \r\nSir, as the President of the General Assembly, to ensure \r\nthat the eleventh round does not amount to an exercise in \r\nstatement-making but is a real process of negotiations, \r\nwhere representatives focus their energies, line by line \r\nand paragraph by paragraph, on arriving on at least \r\na bracketed text by the conclusion of the sixty-ninth \r\nsession. \r\nAccording to your own estimates, Sir, more \r\nthan 100 Heads of State and Government, in their \r\nstatements made during the high-level segment of \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-ninth session, called for urgent \r\nreform of the Security Council. All our Heads of State \r\nand Government unanimously made the same request \r\nback in 2005. It is therefore a courtesy to the Heads of \r\nState and Government that we provide them with some \r\nfeedback on what we have achieved on the subject — if \r\nanything at all in this process – when they gather for the \r\nseventieth anniversary summit next year. We therefore \r\nhope that once we commence the text-based negotiation \r\nprocess under your leadership, Mr. President, we would \r\nbe able to provide our leaders, when they meet next year, \r\nwith a platform through which a concrete outcome on \r\nthis long-standing subject could eventually be arrived \r\nat.\r\nIt was in 1963, 51 years ago, that the General \r\nAssembly enlarged the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil from 11 to 15, which was a modest increase of \r\nfour in the non-permanent category only. Since then, \r\nthe membership of the United Nations has increased \r\nfrom 113 to 193. Eighty more countries have been \r\nadded, but their addition has not altered the composition \r\nof the world’s premier body mandated to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe have a truly bizarre situation today, when \r\nnearly 75 per cent of the work of the Security Council \r\nis focused exclusively on the continent of Africa, while \r\never since its inception the body has not had even one \r\npermanent member from the whole of the 54-State \r\nAfrican membership. It is therefore critical that we \r\nmove ahead with a results-based timeline as an absolute \r\nimperative. The use of superficial arguments aimed at \r\n14-62259 7/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\navoiding the imposition of artificial timelines while \r\ncalling for fixed timelines in all other United Nations \r\nprocesses reflects an attempt at doublespeak. It is our \r\nGroup’s firm conviction that the year 2015 — which \r\nwill be the seventieth anniversary year of the United \r\nNations and the tenth anniversary year of the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit in which all our Heads of State and \r\nGovernment mandated us to achieve early reforms of \r\nthe Security Council — would be a reasonably early \r\ndate to show progress on this unanimous mandate.\r\nAs the only group that has increased in membership \r\nover the years, and in keeping with our tradition of \r\nactive support for the reform process, the L.69 Group \r\nhas also put forward a number of proposals for turning \r\nour interactions and deliberations into real negotiations. \r\nAs a group with perhaps the largest convergence of \r\nlike-minded countries from the developing world, the \r\nL.69 Group has been able to significantly enhance \r\nconvergences with the African Group and forge a \r\ncommon position that embraces comprehensive reforms. \r\nIt has deliberately avoided a piecemeal approach that \r\nsome of the detractors of any forward movement on \r\nreforms have used to hold the process hostage.\r\nLet me reiterate once again that the L.69 Group \r\nacknowledges and supports the African common \r\nposition as enunciated in the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nSuch enhancement of convergences benefits the \r\nmomentum contributing to the forward movements of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform process, which may also be recognized in the \r\nnegotiation text.\r\nToday, when we see the inability of the Security \r\nCouncil to respond in a timely manner to pressing \r\nissues of war and peace, when we see the Council being \r\nincreasingly exposed to public scrutiny, when large \r\nsections of civil society and academia are questioning \r\nnot just its representativeness but its credibility — even \r\nto the extent of Member States rejecting seats after \r\ngetting elected — we should be seen to be constructively \r\nengaged in restoring the dignity of this premier body \r\nby reforming it to reflect contemporary world realities. \r\nThe L.69 Group is committed to playing its part in \r\nensuring that this result, which we all envisage, is not \r\nleft to future generations but brought about here and \r\nnow, under your able stewardship, Mr. President.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy): On behalf of the group of \r\nStates known as Uniting for Consensus, I wish to \r\nexpress our appreciation to you, Mr. President, for \r\nyour new approach to Security Council reform and \r\nfor your willingness to work in close cooperation and \r\nconsultation with the entire membership of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe first concrete sign of this willingness was in \r\nthe lead-up to the appointment of a new facilitator for \r\nthe reform process. We warmly welcome Ambassador \r\nCourtney Rattray in his new capacity. We are sure \r\nhe will work with the effectiveness and balance with \r\nwhich the entire membership accredits him, and we \r\nwish to immediately offer him our full cooperation and \r\nsupport as he assumes this new pivotal responsibility. I \r\nwould also take this opportunity to thank Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin for his efforts and for the passion he put \r\ninto his work. We also thank the former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for his leadership.\r\nFor the past 20 years, we have been working on \r\nSecurity Council reform, ever since the establishment \r\nof the Open-ended Working Group in 1993. It has been \r\na long journey, in which fewer gains have been made \r\nthan were expected. Nonetheless, we believe that much \r\nhas been learned in the process. The main lesson learned \r\nis that divisive solutions are bound to fail and that they \r\nrisk creating complications and delaying the reform \r\nprocess. If we want to achieve meaningful progress in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, we must go beyond \r\nour traditional proposals and reach out to the other \r\nsides. Only then will we be able to achieve the broad \r\npolitical acceptance that such a crucial reform requires. \r\nBeyond this, discussions in recent years, including \r\nthe last round of intergovernmental negotiations, have \r\nhighlighted the principles that should lead to reform of \r\nthe Security Council. We believe the entire membership \r\nsubscribes to the goal of a more representative, \r\ndemocratic, accountable and effective Council. But can \r\nwe agree on how to achieve that?\r\nThe intention of enlarging the Security Council is \r\nto make it more representative. And indeed one could \r\nargue that from a purely numerical perspective, the \r\nCouncil has become less representative of the overall \r\nUnited Nations membership over the years. But it will \r\ntake more than an increase in membership to make \r\nthe Council more representative. It will also require \r\nincreasing the possibility that all Member States can \r\nperiodically sit on the Council, and the best way to \r\ndo that is to increase the number of elected seats, a \r\nmeasure that would also make the Security Council \r\nmore democratic and accountable to the membership as \r\na whole — that is, to the General Assembly.\r\n8/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nAllocating new permanent seats on a national basis, \r\nrather than making the Council more representative, \r\nwould only enable a still-limited number of countries \r\nto occupy seats forever, thus perpetuating a situation \r\nwhereby more than one third of the entire membership \r\nhas never sat on the Council. It would make the Council \r\nmore exclusive rather than more inclusive and would \r\nstill fail to meet the need for more democracy and \r\naccountability.\r\nWe also need a more effective Security Council. \r\nAccountability and effectiveness go hand in hand, since \r\nthe Council’s decisions must be fully endorsed by the \r\nUnited Nations membership. Uniting for Consensus \r\nwould also like to enable Member States willing to \r\ncontribute significantly to the Council’s work to serve \r\nfor longer periods and with greater frequency. We are \r\nnot asking those who aspire to a greater role in the \r\nSecurity Council to renounce their ambitions. On the \r\ncontrary, we are asking them to maintain their level \r\nof commitment and rise to the challenge of a periodic \r\naccounting to the membership of their contribution to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nUniting for Consensus believes in a new Security \r\nCouncil based on merit, not privilege.\r\nFor many years now, small States, which represent \r\nalmost one fourth of United Nations membership, have \r\nbeen demanding a greater presence on the Security \r\nCouncil. They are increasingly involved in issues related \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nas well as old and new threats. Our work should identify \r\nways to ensure that such States have direct access to \r\nthe Council. Uniting for Consensus also understands \r\nthe aspirations of countries on the African continent \r\nand remains ready to continue working with Africa \r\nto promote equal and non-discriminatory approaches \r\nfor all groups with regard to their representation on \r\nthe Council. Elections, especially for smaller and \r\ndeveloping countries, are the primary instrument \r\nthrough which they can be heard, on an equal footing \r\nand with equal dignity. For that reason, we reiterate our \r\ncall to those countries, and, of course, to all Member \r\nStates, to commit to a modern vision of the Security \r\nCouncil and work together to achieve a Council that \r\nis accountable to the entire membership of the United \r\nNations.\r\nUniting for Consensus is the only negotiating group \r\nthat has already officially introduced two concrete \r\nproposals for Security Council reform designed to \r\ncontribute actively to the negotiating process, and it \r\ncontinues to work on a basis of progress and compromise. \r\nWe support a compromise solution, a model that we \r\ndeem fair and equitable that could reasonably reflect the \r\ninterests of all. We are ready to discuss such solutions \r\nto ensure that they represent the legitimate aspirations \r\nof the membership. We must explore the middle ground, \r\nand to reach that middle ground we must find a point of \r\nconvergence. Uniting for Consensus has been working \r\non a proposal that focuses on creating new seats, along \r\nwith the possibility of longer tenure on the Council and \r\nimmediate re-election. In our view, that formula would \r\nenable those who have the desire and the capacity to \r\ncontribute more to its work to spend extended periods \r\non the Council. The length of the terms and the \r\npossibility of immediate re-election offer a broad range \r\nof alternatives that could allow us to identify the point \r\nof convergence we are striving for.\r\nOf course, Uniting for Consensus also remains \r\nopen to considering new ideas in order to bridge \r\ngaps between it and other groups. In accordance with \r\nthat position, in the past few weeks we have begun a \r\npreliminary series of informal meetings with the other \r\nnegotiating groups to explore possible common ground, \r\nand we intend to continue on that path. We are among \r\nthe first to encourage debate, but without artificial \r\ndeadlines. Uniting for Consensus, no doubt like all the \r\nother negotiating groups, has no desire to work in a \r\nvacuum or waste any more time.\r\nWith genuine political openness, Uniting for \r\nConsensus acknowledges the call for text-based \r\nnegotiations in the President’s letter dated 10 November. \r\nWe have never closed the door on this method of work; \r\nin fact, we have often stressed that we should first and \r\nforemost agree on such a text. As of now, the only valid \r\ndocument that has the support of the whole membership \r\nis the second revision of the compiled text, and we are \r\nready to work in that direction.\r\nWe are convinced that any future solution to \r\nthe Security Council reform process will require \r\nwillingness to compromise and bold leadership. That \r\napproach is at the heart of the Uniting for Consensus \r\ncommitment. In keeping with decision 62/557, we will \r\ncontinue to engage with f lexibility and in a spirit of \r\nsincere cooperation in order to achieve a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council that benefits the entire \r\nmembership.\r\nLastly, I would like to add that it is difficult to \r\nunderstand why anyone would argue against seeking \r\n14-62259 9/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nconsensus. The United Nations is stronger when all its \r\nmembers unite behind a single goal.\r\nMr. Minah (Sierra Leone): It is an honour for me \r\nto speak on behalf of the Group of African States in \r\ntoday’s debate. It presents a welcome opportunity for the \r\nAfrican Group to take stock of the recently concluded \r\n10 rounds of intergovernmental negotiations. It is also \r\nan opportunity for us to set the stage for the next phase, \r\nwhich we hope will move the process in a meaningful \r\ndirection aimed at text-based negotiations. \r\nWe can all agree that a reformed Security \r\nCouncil must conform to the principles of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution while maintaining a balance \r\nin its relationship with the Assembly as envisaged in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nSince the adoption of decision 62/557 on \r\n15 September 2008, the reform process has moved on \r\ncautiously, but not at a pace to our liking. Delegations \r\nhave stated and repeated their positions and made \r\nclear where they stand on the various key issues. \r\nConvergences, divergences and areas of possible \r\ncollaboration are now very well known. At this stage, \r\nwe believe that the exchanges of the 10 rounds have \r\nmade clear what we need to focus on. It is therefore \r\nour hope that the next session will focus on a text for \r\nnegotiation that will dictate the future progress of this \r\nprocess.\r\nThe African Group has consistently stated the \r\nimperative of comprehensively reforming the Security \r\nCouncil to address the historical injustice that leaves \r\nAfrica as the only continent not represented in the \r\npermanent category of Council membership and \r\nunderrepresented in the non-permanent category. \r\nAfrica’s common position, as reflected in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and Sirte Declaration, is well known. We \r\nhave always expressed reservations about the process \r\nof negotiations itself, because we are engaged in \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that are not true \r\nnegotiations. We have nonetheless continued in a spirit \r\nof good faith and continue to be engaged and commit \r\nto discussions and collaborations with our partners and \r\nother delegations.\r\nThe sense in the Assembly over the past 10 rounds \r\nwas that a good majority of delegations are in favour of \r\nan expansion in both categories of membership. There \r\nwas considerable support for the inclusion of small \r\nand medium-sized States and for an enhanced African \r\nrepresentation in an expanded Security Council. There \r\nis no doubt our past exchanges have yielded some \r\nprogress, but we are in danger of the process becoming \r\nsterile and moribund. At this stage, the African \r\nGroup calls for modalities to establish a timeline for \r\nnegotiations. We call for all delegations, all groups and \r\nall those interested in Security Council reform to move \r\ntowards the process of real negotiations. The point we \r\nmake is simply this: only real negotiations can lead to \r\nreal reform.\r\nThe African Group reiterates its resolve to continue \r\nto work towards building alliances and narrowing \r\ndown differences, with particular focus on substance \r\nand not so much on procedure. We wish to underscore \r\nand put on record the continuing progressive and \r\nencouraging consultations we have had with a number \r\nof groups, including but not limited to the L.69 Group, \r\nthe Caribbean Community and the Pacific Forum. \r\nAfrica stands ready, willing and able to continue to \r\nengage, collaborate and cooperate to move this process \r\nforward. We look forward to a negotiation on a text. \r\nThe boundaries of that negotiation have yet to be set, \r\nand obviously there needs to be preliminary agreement \r\non the principles and substance regarding the various \r\nissues.\r\nWe are grateful to Ambassador Tanin for his \r\nsterling service and the long hours, weeks, months and \r\nyears he has put into this process, and we welcome the \r\nappointment of the representative of Jamaica to join us \r\nin our common cause. As a group, we remain committed \r\nto working together with any group that wishes to \r\nachieve our ultimate objective of a representative, \r\naccountable, democratic, truly representative and truly \r\ntransparent Security Council.\r\nThe African position has gained and continues to \r\ngain support. We are grateful to the L.69 Group for \r\ntoday explicitly endorsing the African position. Our \r\nprincipals, our Heads of State, have made it quite clear \r\nthat we must move towards concrete action on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Having gone through 10 rounds and \r\nseveral informal and formal discussions, every group \r\nis aware of one another’s position and every group is \r\naware of the limits of each other’s position. The next \r\nlogical step must be negotiations.\r\nWith a new facilitator, we believe there will be \r\nnewfound impetus in this process, and we believe that \r\nif we work together as a whole, this illusory consensus \r\nthat we all seek will actually become a reality. There \r\nis no greater issue in front of us as an Assembly than \r\nthe revitalization of this Organization, in which the \r\n10/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nreform of the Security Council plays a key part. The \r\nAfrican Group remains open to all informal approaches \r\nand will continue its process of outreach to all groups, \r\nboth those closely aligned with our positions and those \r\nthat have significant concerns regarding our position, \r\nbecause we believe our position, given the historical \r\ninjustice, is legitimate, and we believe that our position \r\ncan survive any process of negotiation.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am \r\nhonoured to read this statement on behalf of the Group \r\nof Arab States. At the outset, I would like assure you, \r\nSir, of the support of our Group in your leadership \r\nof the Assembly’s work at this session. I would also \r\nlike to thank Ambassador Zahir Tanin, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Afghanistan, for his efforts in \r\nfacilitating the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We also welcome the \r\nappointment of Ambassador Rattray to lead the next \r\ncycle of talks.\r\nThe international community is faced with new \r\nchallenges with increasing frequency, and this \r\nstrengthens our resolve to enhance the Security \r\nCouncil’s role and reform it in order to enable it to \r\nbe better meet those challenges. That will require the \r\nCouncil to be more representative, transparent, neutral \r\nand credible. The question of Security Council reform \r\nand equitable representation on the Council are the \r\npillars of the comprehensive reform of the Organization.\r\nMore than 20 years after the first discussions on \r\nenlarging the Council and improving its methods \r\nof work, we have seen a number of initiatives and \r\ndifferent positions adopted by groups and Member \r\nStates, including the Arab Group. It is now necessary to \r\naccelerate the reform, especially as there is consensus \r\non the need for reform after the significant changes \r\nsince the establishment of the Organization in 1945. \r\nThat does not mean that we should rush, which would \r\nprevent us from achieving a consensus-based solution. \r\nExtablishing a deadline could be an obstacle to a \r\ncomprehensive solution. In that context, the Arab Group \r\naffirms that the intergovernmental negotiations should \r\ntake place within the context of the General Assembly, \r\nas it is the only appropriate venue in which to debate \r\nthis matter in accordance with decision 62/557 while \r\npreserving Member States’ ownership of this process.\r\nThe Arab Group also affirms that the starting point \r\nthat we select for resuming the negotiations should \r\ninclude all proposals by Member States. Any changes \r\nthat might have taken place regarding those proposals \r\nor any linkages between proposals should be taken into \r\naccount with the consent of the country or group that \r\ninitially made the proposal. Those are clear criteria \r\nthat should guide Ambassador Rattray in his work for \r\nthe resumption of the negotiations, in order to reach a \r\nconsensus among the different countries regarding the \r\nbest way to move forward on this important question.\r\nIn this context, the Group wishes to highlight the \r\nissue of the right of veto. The unjust use of the veto \r\nby the Permanent Five (P5) has in many cases helped \r\ndamage the credibility of the decision-making process \r\nin the Security Council. On some occasions it has \r\nresulted in the Council being unable to discharge its \r\nresponsibilities and to take the necessary measures for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThe use of the veto by the P5 over the past years has \r\nreflected their anxious concern to use it to defend their \r\nnational interests and those of their allies. Despite the \r\nlimited use of the veto over the past 20 years, compared \r\nto previous eras, it still represents an effective way \r\nto immunize some Governments against being held \r\naccountable. For example, it has been used 15 times \r\nin a total of 27 occasions during the last 20 years to \r\nprotect illegal practices by the Israeli authorities in the \r\noccupied Arab territories.\r\nThe procedures and working methods must be \r\nimproved to make them more effective and transparent. \r\nPermanent rules should be adopted to replace the \r\ntemporary ones that have been in effect for a number of \r\nyears. We should also consider the issue of increasing \r\nthe number of plenary meetings and strengthening \r\nthe role of countries that are on the Council’s agenda. \r\nSuch meetings are a genuine opportunity for States not \r\nmembers of the Council to debate Council issues. We \r\nmust also limit the number of closed meetings — they \r\nshould be an exception and not the rule. We should \r\npublicize Council communiqués and resolutions \r\nand consult the countries concerned so that they \r\ncan participate in discussions concerning them, in \r\naccordance with Article 31 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We invite subsidiary bodies of the Council \r\nto provide thorough information on their activities to \r\nMember States. The Arab Group also urges the Council \r\nto strictly limit itself to its mandate under the Charter.\r\nThe position of member States of the League of \r\nArab States is well known. We are asking for permanent \r\nrepresentation as part of any future enlargement of \r\nthe Council. We refer to the document that was issued \r\nby the facilitator. We would also like to reiterate the \r\n14-62259 11/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nimportance of the negotiations that took place during \r\nthe tenth round of intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nabsolutely must not set temporary artificial deadlines \r\nthat could be an obstacle to moving the reform forward. \r\nWe affirm our willingness to constructively contribute \r\nto the work in the sixty-ninth session in order to achieve \r\ncomprehensive Council reform.\r\nMs. Frankinet (Belgium): I have the pleasure to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and \r\nthe Kingdom of Belgium. \r\nI thank you, Mr. President, for convening this annual \r\ndebate on Security Council reform. I thank you also for \r\nyour letter of 10 November, in which you announced \r\nthe appointment of Ambassador Courtenay Rattray as \r\nthe new Chair of the United Nations intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We wish \r\nAmbassador Rattray all the best in his new position, \r\nand we thank him for taking up this challenge. We have \r\nfull confidence in his ability to successfully lead the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nThe Netherlands and Belgium would also like to \r\npay special tribute to our previous Chair, Ambassador \r\nTanin of Afghanistan, who skilfully and for many years \r\nsteered the work of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe thank Ambassador Tanin and his entire team for all \r\nthe hard work of the past years. It is fair to say that we did \r\na lot of fruitful and important work during the previous \r\nsession of the General Assembly. It started with the \r\ninitiative of a former Assembly President, Ambassador \r\nJohn Ashe, to create an advisory group of the President \r\nof the General Assembly on Security Council reform. \r\nThat advisory group produced a non-paper, which, in \r\nour view, offers a very useful tool for our discussions \r\nand which has been used as such by many delegations.\r\nUnder the leadership of Ambassador Tanin we also \r\nheld debates on each of the five clusters of Security \r\nCouncil reform and a sixth one on cross-cutting issues. \r\nLast summer, at the request of the former President \r\nof the General Assembly, Ambassador Tanin shared \r\nwith us his personal assessment of our work, and he \r\nadded thought-provoking recommendations on the way \r\nforward.\r\nFor years now, we have scrutinized Security \r\nCouncil reform from all possible angles. The positions \r\nare well known. It is clear where opinions diverge, but \r\nit is even clearer where large consensuses can be found. \r\nNo one is waiting for another year of repetitive debates \r\nwith only slight variations. This year, perhaps more than \r\never before, business as usual is no longer an option. \r\nSo let us build on the results of last year and take the \r\nprocess one step further. We all know how to do this. \r\nIt has been said many times before, and Ambassador \r\nTanin mentioned it in his recommendations. \r\nJust as in any other process at the General Assembly, \r\nwe need to engage in a genuine give and take. We need \r\nto start real negotiations. And we need to do it on the \r\nbasis of a text — a text that will be a starting point, not \r\na foregone conclusion, for text-based negotiations will \r\nallow us ultimately to converge rather than diverge, \r\nregardless of what text is used as a basis. However, we \r\ncannot make text-based negotiations conditional upon \r\na pre-existing consensus on the text to be used. That \r\nwould be equivalent to calling for the solution to be \r\nagreed before we actually begin to address the problem.\r\nWe count on your determination and guidance, \r\nMr. President, to create a new momentum, because the \r\nultimate goal of our endeavour remains as important \r\nas ever: a more effective, transparent, accountable \r\nand representative Security Council that reflects the \r\ngeopolitical realities of the twenty-first century and \r\ncontributes to a more credible United Nations and \r\na reinforced international system. As always, the \r\nNetherlands and Belgium stand ready to fully support \r\nboth you and the Chair of our working group.\r\nMr. Pankin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe question of Security Council reform is one of the \r\nmost important issues on the General Assembly’s \r\nagenda, as the Council is the body that, according to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, bears the primary \r\nresponsibility for maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. The final result of the Security Council reform \r\nprocess will largely depend on the effectiveness of the \r\nAssembly’s efforts and those of the United Nations \r\nas a whole, as well as on the international security \r\narchitecture.\r\nWe congratulate the Ambassador of Jamaica, \r\nMr. Rattray, on his appointment as facilitator of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We hope that his \r\nwork in this difficult area will help to maintain a \r\nconstructive atmosphere for the negotiations so that a \r\nmutually acceptable solution can be reached. We thank \r\nthe Ambassador of Afghanistan, Mr. Tanin, for the \r\neffective work he carried out for the past five years.\r\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council, \r\nthe Russian Federation notes the need to make that \r\nbody more representative. However, efforts in that \r\n12/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nregard must not impact the Council’s ability to promptly \r\nand effectively respond to emerging challenges. This \r\nis especially crucial today as we are witnessing a \r\nproliferation of hot spots of conflict throughout the \r\nworld. In this context, we call for maintaining a compact \r\nSecurity Council membership. Its optimal number \r\nshould not exceed a little more than 20 members. We \r\nreject any idea that would infringe on the prerogatives \r\nof the current permanent Council members, including \r\nthe veto. We recall that the veto is an important factor \r\nin encouraging Council members to seek generally \r\nacceptable and balanced solutions. Trying to eliminate \r\nthe veto would be an historical and political mistake.\r\nThe discussion on how to reform the Security \r\nCouncil is difficult and has gone on for quite a while. \r\nTen rounds of intergovernmental negotiations have \r\nbeen held. Member States have made some progress \r\non the reform track, but a comprehensive solution that \r\nwould satisfy the majority is still not on the horizon. \r\nWe fully support the opinion, heard often from this \r\nrostrum, that the Security Council reform process \r\nmust be owned by all Member States without exception \r\nand, with its signature wording, that it must have the \r\nbroadest possible support of the membership. If we \r\ncannot reach a consensus on this issue, it is politically \r\nessential to ensure the support of a much larger number \r\nof Member States than the legally required two-thirds \r\nmajority vote of the General Assembly.\r\nWe are convinced that the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform cannot be resolved by exclusively \r\nmathematical means, using various voting models \r\nto yield the minimum required number of votes. A \r\nresult achieved this way would be unlikely to add to \r\nthe Security Council’s authority and effectiveness, \r\nand it would certainly not help strengthen our global \r\nOrganization — quite the contrary.\r\nAt the same time, we are ready to consider any \r\nreasonable option to enlarge the Council membership, \r\nincluding the so-called intermediate option, that is, \r\na compromise solution, as long as it is based on the \r\nbroadest possible consensus in the United Nations. \r\nHowever, the status of the negotiations does not allow \r\nus to say that we are closer to a universal formula for \r\nSecurity Council reform that would receive the broadest \r\npossible support. Approaches still diverge substantially, \r\nsometimes diametrically. In such circumstances, we \r\ndo not see an alternative to continuing, at the current \r\nsession of the General Assembly, the patient work of \r\nbringing positions together.\r\nWe hope that the efforts of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the facilitator of the negotiations \r\nwill be directed specifically at lending as much support \r\nto the negotiations as possible, on the understanding \r\nthat ownership in this process belongs to the Member \r\nStates. This painstaking work should be conducted in \r\na peaceful, transparent and inclusive manner, without \r\narbitrary timelines. We must all be very mindful that \r\non this matter there is no room for artificial or symbolic \r\ndeadlines and dates or attempts to resolve this complex \r\nproblem with the stroke of the pen.\r\nLet us not forget the most important thing — progress \r\non Security Council reform depends only on the \r\npolitical will of Member States and their willingness to \r\nreach a reasonable compromise. We call on all States to \r\nfollow this fundamental principle.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): As we approach \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, the \r\nsystem of international peace and security created by the \r\nCharter is still very much at the heart of the international \r\norder. When crises erupt  — in Syria, Ukraine, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic or elsewhere — the international \r\ncommunity looks to the Security Council for leadership \r\nand guidance. The powers vested in the Council under \r\nthe Charter are unique, leading to great expectations. \r\nAll too often, those expectations are not fulfilled. By \r\nfailing to take a decisive role in conflicts, such as in \r\nSyria and Ukraine, the Council risks losing its central \r\nrole and creating the impression that it can effectively \r\naddress crises only where permanent members do not \r\nfeel they have a national stake in the matter.\r\nThe 2005 World Summit recognized the necessity of \r\nSecurity Council reform and supported “early reform” \r\nof the Council, with leaders committing themselves to \r\ncontinuing their efforts to achieve a decision to this end. \r\nWe have not come any closer to reforming the Security \r\nCouncil since then. This is not for want of proposals, \r\nbut for want of genuine engagement. With so much at \r\nstake and with no understanding of a timeline and no \r\nclear process in place, we all find it easier to repeat our \r\npositions than to signal concessions that would allow \r\nmoving the process forward.\r\nIn terms of expanding the Council, my delegation \r\nstands by a model that offers a middle ground between \r\nthe two most extreme positions. That model, which \r\nwe presented as a full-f ledged proposal two years \r\nago, would add a category of long-term elected seats \r\nto the Council, with terms of eight or ten years, for \r\nexample. States in the new category of seats would \r\n14-62259 13/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nbe allowed to stand for immediate re-election. States \r\nthat unsuccessfully sought election for the longer-term \r\nseats would be barred from standing for election for the \r\nexisting two-year seats for the duration of what would \r\nhave been their term of office. A mandatory review of \r\nthe mechanism would take place after two terms in the \r\nnew long-term seats.\r\nThis is an intermediate approach in the sense that \r\nit seeks to bridge the gap between those who favour \r\nexpansion in the two existing categories and those who \r\nwant expansion in the non-permanent category only. \r\nBut it is not meant to be a transition to a particular final \r\noutcome. Much rather, it is a viable model in its own \r\nright, albeit with the possibility of further change as part \r\nof a review after 20 years or so. We remain convinced \r\nthat such an approach is the most viable option for \r\nexpansion, both as far as acceptance in the Assembly \r\nand in the necessary ratification process. Moreover, \r\nwe are deeply sceptical that the addition of more veto-\r\nwielding permanent members would truly make the \r\nSecurity Council a more effective institution, and we \r\nare of the view that many others share that scepticism.\r\nAnyone unfortunate enough to sit through sessions \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations will hear much of \r\nthe desirability of a comprehensive solution and why we \r\nmust avoid a piecemeal approach. We certainly agree \r\nthat amending the Charter is an enormous task and \r\nthat we have to produce a package of amendments that \r\ncovers all aspects of Council reform. It is precisely these \r\namendments that the intergovernmental negotiations are \r\nsupposed to negotiate. But we do not agree to use this as \r\na pretext to not call on the Council to immediately take \r\nwhat measures it can take to become more transparent, \r\nmore accountable and more effective. The practice of \r\nthe Council is evolving and it does make adjustments to \r\nthe new challenges it faces, although many of us would \r\nlike to see much more of that. Using enlargement, or \r\nabsence thereof, as a pretext to not promote this type of \r\nimprovements is to our mind clearly counterproductive.\r\nWe are thinking in particular of the efforts to \r\nestablish a code of conduct that would limit the use \r\nof the veto in situations involving atrocity crimes, a \r\nproposal we wholeheartedly support. Such an agreement \r\nrequires no Charter amendment, nor indeed any action \r\nper se by the General Assembly at all. Certainly the \r\nagreement on such a code of conduct does not have \r\nto wait until we agree on how to expand the Security \r\nCouncil. The same can be said for issues related to \r\nthe working methods more generally. Decision 62/557, \r\nwhich created the mandate of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, is meant to pertain to the working methods \r\nof an expanded Security Council and nothing else. It is \r\nnot a roadblock to practical measures that would make \r\nthe Council a more effective organ today.\r\nAs we ponder how to move the Council reform \r\nforward, we cannot see the utility of simply going through \r\nthe motions in the intergovernmental negotiations as \r\nwe have for the past five years. Last year’s report of the \r\nadvisory group to the then President John Ashe gives us \r\na solid summary of all of the negotiating positions. The \r\ntime has come to either try something new or to put the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to rest.\r\nWe thank Ambassador Tanin for his tireless efforts \r\nfor the past five years, and we welcome Ambassador \r\nRattray and wish him every success in his difficult \r\ntask. We hope that he will take the leadership role \r\ntraditionally accorded to those who lead negotiations on \r\nbehalf of the President of the General Assembly. That is \r\nhow every other membership-driven negotiation in this \r\nbuilding works, and we do not see why this one should \r\nbe any different. Before we begin the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, we would also like to see an assessment \r\nfrom the Chair as to the results he feels are attainable in \r\nthe current session of the Assembly. That would give us \r\na yardstick whereby to measure our progress.\r\nWe stand ready to work with you, Mr. President, \r\nand the Chair of the United Nations intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform to make \r\nmeaningful progress in this session.\r\nMs. Jones (United States of America): The United \r\nStates is pleased to participate in this annual plenary \r\ndebate on the important topic of Security Council \r\nreform.\r\nToday’s debate occurs as we look ahead to the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations next year. \r\nThe United Nations is a very different place, as is the \r\nworld. Since its inception, the Organization has grown \r\nfrom 51 Members to 193 Members. The challenges \r\nfacing us are more complex and more pressing \r\nthan ever — from addressing the Ebola outbreak to \r\ncombating the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant to \r\nmaking sure peacekeeping operations in crisis hot spots \r\nare successful. To face these issues, we need a Security \r\nCouncil that represents today’s realities, one that is \r\nfully capable of carrying out its mandate.\r\nThe landmark year of 2015 is a compelling moment \r\nfor the membership to consider appropriate ways to \r\n14/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nachieve successful Council reform. The United States \r\ncontinues to believe that it is critical that any reform \r\nof the Council enjoys the broadest possible consensus \r\namong Member States. To that end, we need to follow \r\na serious, deliberate path forward. The United States \r\nis committed to this process and remains open to \r\nmodest Council expansion in both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. Any consideration of which \r\ncountries merit future permanent membership should \r\ntake into account their ability and willingness to \r\ncontribute to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity and to the other purposes of the United Nations, \r\nand their ability to exercise the heavy responsibility \r\nthat comes with Security Council membership.\r\nMy delegation congratulates Ambassador Rattray \r\non his appointment as Chair of the United Nations \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. My delegation also thanks Ambassador Tanin \r\nfor his leadership of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess for the past five years. We believe that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations remain the most \r\nappropriate forum for continued discussions of Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nFinally, we encourage all to approach the upcoming \r\nsessions on Security Council reform constructively. We \r\nknow many Member States feel that the issue has been \r\nstudied for too long without action. But we hope that, \r\nby working together, we can consider a way forward \r\nthat is agreeable to the broadest possible majority of \r\nUnited Nations members, an arrangement that can best \r\npromote the Council’s primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in line \r\nwith the ideals that were central to the founders of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): I congratulate you, Mr. President, \r\non your effective and impressive presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session since you \r\ntook office in September this year. You have the fullest \r\nsupport of my delegation in assisting you in all your \r\nendeavours in this session of the General Assembly.\r\nAllow me to first align myself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Saint Lucia on behalf \r\nof the L.69 Group, as well as with that delivered by \r\nrepresentative of Brazil on behalf of the Group of \r\nFour (G4). I would also like to convey my delegation’s \r\nfullest endorsement of the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Guyana on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM).\r\nI would like to submit the following for our \r\nconsideration today. \r\nFirst, we warmly welcome the appointment \r\nof Ambassador Courtney Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, as the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We have been impressed by the constructive \r\nmanner in which Ambassador Rattray has conducted \r\nthe proceedings of the First Committee, and we \r\nare confident that his appointment bodes well for \r\nthis intergovernmental negotiation. We thank the \r\nAmbassador of Afghanistan, Ambassador Tanin, for \r\nhaving skilfully guided our process so far.\r\nWe now look to you, Sir, as the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, to truly empower our Chairman \r\nby giving him, under your authority, a text on the \r\nbasis of which all of us can begin to engage in actual \r\nnegotiations. This will provide a refreshing contrast \r\nto all previous rounds of negotiations so far in this \r\nprocess. We must actually be the only forum in the \r\nUnited Nations to be negotiating without a negotiating \r\ntext on the table before us. As my delegation has stated \r\nso many times in the past, without a negotiation text, it \r\nis impossible for any us to demonstrate our commitment \r\nto multilateralism and our f lexibility in reaching \r\nan outcome to be reported to our Heads of State and \r\nGovernment in September next year.\r\nAs in all other negotiating processes under way \r\nin the General Assembly, our intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation should not be perceived to be biased against \r\nany individual country or group of countries just \r\nbecause a text is on the table. However, if there is no \r\ntext on the table, then we would surely have just cause \r\nto detect a bias against those of us who are seriously \r\nengaged in implementing the explicit mandate for \r\nearly reform of the Security Council given to us by our \r\nleaders in 2005.\r\nSecondly, my delegation is of the firm view \r\nthat the wish of the vast majority of Member States \r\nparticipating in the intergovernmental negotiation is to \r\nrecommend expansion in both categories, permanent \r\nand non-permanent, of the reformed Security Council. \r\nThat includes several Member States that do not belong \r\nto any groupings, as well as large and pro-reform \r\ngroupings such as the L.69 Group; the Committee of 10, \r\nwhich represents the Ezulwini Consensus of the Africa \r\nGroup; CARICOM; small island developing States; the \r\n14-62259 15/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nGroup of Four and, most recently, the Group of Arab \r\nStates with its demand for a permanent seat.\r\nOur assessment is based on the statements made \r\nby those Member States in both our intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process so far and the more than 100 \r\nstatements made by Heads of State and Government \r\nduring the recent high-level segments of the sixty-ninth \r\nsession, held in September and October. The latter is \r\na recorded fact and must not be ignored or questioned \r\nwhile considering the assertion just made by us.\r\nThirdly, we believe that to insist that no forward \r\nmovement can take place in our process until we have \r\ncomplete consensus on any text at the very beginning \r\nof the process is not in keeping with the unanimous \r\nconsensus for early reform of the Council mandated by \r\nour leaders in paragraph 153 of the 2005 World Summit \r\noutcome document (resolution 60/1). We therefore \r\nrequest that once the negotiation text authorized by you, \r\nMr. President, is placed before us by our new Chair, we \r\nengage in the give and take of actual negotiations to \r\ndefine what early reform of the Council actually means \r\nfor the vast majority of us in the Assembly. It would be \r\na blot on the collective integrity of the Organization if \r\nwe were to turn our backs on this subject and ignore \r\nit completely when our leaders meet next year for the \r\nhistoric seventieth-anniversary summit of the United \r\nNations.\r\nFinally, my delegation would like to once again put \r\nthis issue in the context in which the Security Council \r\nis actually required to function. The Council — which \r\nhas the primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security under the Charter \r\nand which acts under Articles 24, paragraph 1, and \r\nArticle 25 on behalf of all of us Member States – is \r\ntoday a seriously impaired organ. The litany of crises \r\ndotting the international landscape involving the lives \r\nof millions of people that the Council does not have \r\nthe will or the resources to address demonstrates that \r\nvividly. Even in the area of its core competence, the \r\nCouncil is unable to act with credibility, essentially due \r\nto its unrepresentative nature.\r\nFor the Council to become more effective, early \r\nreforms, as collectively envisioned by our leaders 10 \r\nyears ago, are an urgent necessity. Such reforms, if \r\nimplemented properly, will restore to the Council \r\nits credibility, enable it to share the responsibility of \r\nits functions with fresh and needed resources, both \r\nfinancial and intellectual, and, most importantly, restore \r\nthe provisions of Chapter VI of the Charter, which \r\nrequires recourse to peaceful, non-violent means, based \r\non the rule of law, to settle disputes as the preferred \r\nmeans to maintain international peace and security.\r\nAs the Prime Minister of India stated from this \r\nvery rostrum on 27 September:\r\n“It is important that we improve the Security \r\nCouncil by making it more democratic and \r\nparticipative. Institutions that reflect the imperatives \r\nof the twentieth century will not be effective in \r\nthe twenty-first century. They face the risk of \r\nirrelevance” (A/69/PV.15, p. 17).\r\nHe also said that we would face the risk of continuing \r\nturbulence with no one capable of addressing it, adding \r\nthat we should fulfil our promise to reform the Security \r\nCouncil by 2015.\r\nSir Mark Lyall Grant (United Kingdom): The \r\nUnited Kingdom is grateful for this opportunity to \r\nreaffirm publicly our strong commitment to reforming \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe United Kingdom warmly welcomes the \r\nappointment of Ambassador Courtenay Rattray as the \r\nnew Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. I pay \r\ntribute to his predecessor, Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nwho worked tirelessly to establish a common position \r\nfrom which to move forward together. We thank him for \r\nhis concerted efforts, which have provided a foundation \r\nfor the progress we must all work to achieve. We look \r\nforward to working closely and productively with \r\nAmbassador Rattray and hope that his appointment will \r\ninvigorate the process and lead it towards an agreed \r\noutcome.\r\nThe United Kingdom’s position on Security Council \r\nreform has not changed. The United Kingdom supports \r\nnew permanent seats for Brazil, Germany, India and \r\nJapan, alongside permanent African representation. \r\nWe also support an expansion in the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats. \r\nAs others have said, next year we will celebrate the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations and the \r\ntenth anniversary of the Summit Outcome. Let us mark \r\nthose occasions with genuine action on reform.\r\nDisagreement around whether or not to extend \r\nthe veto right has proved one of the key obstacles to \r\nmaking any progress on Security Council reform. A \r\npriority for all of us must be to ensure that any reform \r\ndoes not reduce the Council’s capacity to effectively \r\ndeal with threats to international peace and security. In \r\n16/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nthat context, the United Kingdom does not support the \r\nextension of veto rights to new permanent members. \r\nWe note with interest the French initiative for voluntary \r\nPermanent Five veto restraint and welcome the valuable \r\ndebate it has sparked. We have been appalled by the \r\ncynical way in which the veto has been used since \r\n2011 to enable the perpetuation of mass atrocities and \r\nwar crimes by the Syrian regime. We cannot envisage \r\ncircumstances in which the United Kingdom would \r\nuse its veto to block an appropriate response to a mass \r\natrocity or other major crisis. But to be meaningful, this \r\ninitiative would, of course, require the united support \r\nof all the permanent members of the Council.\r\nIt is important that arguments on contentious issues \r\nsuch as the veto be heard, but we also need to be careful \r\nto ensure that the range of different and opposing views \r\naround the veto do not distract us from the important \r\ntask of broadening the membership of the Council to \r\nensure that it is a better reflection of the modern world.\r\nLet me finish by reaffirming the United \r\nKingdom’s commitment to improving the Security \r\nCouncil’s working methods. Improving the Council’s \r\neffectiveness must go hand in hand with any discussion \r\non increasing its size. The United Kingdom works \r\nhard to ensure that the Council is continually looking \r\nat new ways to improve its efficiency, effectiveness \r\nand transparency, including through the use of \r\ntechnological advancements. We are always open to new \r\npractical suggestions for improvement and welcome \r\nthe constructive spirit in which the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency Group has engaged in \r\ndiscussions on the Council’s working methods.\r\nMs. Chan (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): Costa \r\nRica welcomes the convening of this meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters.\r\nMy delegation welcomes also the appointment \r\nof Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, as the new Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We also express \r\nour deep appreciation to Ambassador Zahir Tanin, \r\nPermanent Representative of Afghanistan, for his work.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to continuing to \r\nwork with members most seriously in this process, \r\nwhich should be guided by the fundamental principles \r\ngoverning the Organization, and promoting first and \r\nforemost the strengthening of multilateralism.\r\nCosta Rica has participated in every round of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, providing clear \r\narguments and specific proposals concerning the \r\nreasons underlying its principled position. Our objective \r\nhas been this: to achieve an in-depth, comprehensive \r\nand inclusive reform of the Security Council, one that \r\nis anchored in the principle of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates and the criteria of legitimacy, representativeness, \r\neffectiveness and transparency.\r\nDemocratic reform can be achieved only through a \r\ncommitment to compromise and through a constructive \r\nand f lexible spirit among Member States. It is for \r\nthat reason that Costa Rica shares the concerns and \r\nsuggestions expressed by the representative of Italy on \r\nbehalf of the Uniting for Consensus group.\r\nThroughout the 10 rounds of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, Costa Rica has explained why it is firmly \r\nopposed to the creation of new permanent seats and any \r\nextension of the veto or any other prerogative in the \r\nSecurity Council. Costa Rica believes that no reform \r\nof the Security Council can be effective, legitimate \r\nor democratic if it consists merely in extending the \r\nprivileges that a few currently enjoy and adding \r\npermanent seats for others.\r\nMy country has therefore argued that careful \r\nexpansion of the non-permanent membership category, \r\nwith the option of some keeping their the seat for more \r\nthan two consecutive years, is the only way of achieving \r\na more representative and legitimate body — a body \r\nin which can be heard the revitalizing voices and \r\nworldviews of Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, whose readiness to play an \r\nactive role in the context of the items currently before \r\nthe Security Council will also contribute to ensuring \r\ngreater accountability on the part of non-permanent \r\nmembers. \r\nThis geometry of transformed representation \r\nwill also make it possible to significantly increase \r\nthe chances for election to the Council, which would \r\nbenefit above all smaller countries such as my own, \r\nwhich constitute a majority of the Organization’s \r\nMembers. The goal is to increase the real possibilities \r\nfor the entire membership, not to limit them further.\r\nA profound improvement in working methods will \r\nalso serve to consolidate those real possibilities. We \r\nknow that in a larger Council should be clearer and \r\nmore predictible, systematic and transparent.\r\n14-62259 17/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nCosta Rica is concerned that the document presented \r\nby the advisory group is being put forth as a tool to help \r\nstructure the intergovernmental negotiations, when in \r\neffect it is a summary of some but not all the proposals \r\nfor the negotiation process. My country believes that \r\nthe advisory group document cannot and should not be \r\nthe basis for guiding our work. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and the texts that we have worked on \r\ntogether as a body of 193 countries enjoy precedence \r\nand absolute legitimacy over any other process or \r\nparallel text. The only document that can claim the \r\nsupport of the entire membership is the second revised \r\ndocument.\r\nThe solution does not lie in presenting partial \r\nproposals for reform outside the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process. That will only further divide the \r\nmembership and delay the possibility of comprehensive \r\nSecurity Council reform. Let us comply with the content \r\nof decision 62/557 and, in good faith and in an open and \r\ntransparent manner, negotiate a comprehensive reform \r\nof the Council that takes into account the five main \r\nthemes contained in the proposals of Member States, \r\nin order to arrive at the broadest possible political \r\nagreement.\r\nCosta Rica reiterates its readiness to participate \r\nin any and all consultations that the presidency deems \r\nnecessary, and to collaborate in a constructive, actively \r\nengaged spirit in the design of a process that allows us \r\nto move forward at this defining moment for the future \r\nof the Organization — a process that should lead to \r\nSecurity Council reform for all, not only for a few.\r\nMr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I would like \r\nto express my gratitude to you, Mr. President, for \r\nconvening this timely meeting. Security Council reform \r\nhas great importance for the Council’s functioning and \r\nfor the future of the United Nations. We appreciate your \r\ninitiative to work for common ground on that agenda, in \r\nclose consultation with the United Nations membership.\r\nThe Republic of Korea supports the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council as an important and urgent matter. \r\nThe Council must be reformed in accordance with \r\nthe changing geopolitical realities of the world today. \r\nAt the same time, it is critical to bring about a more \r\nrepresentative, accountable, democratic and efficient \r\nSecurity Council. The only plausible way to achieve \r\nthat is by holding periodic elections. An expansion \r\nof the number of elected members would bring a \r\nbetter balance to the Council, thereby improving its \r\nwork. Acountability through elections is fundamental \r\nto our Governments, parliaments and multilateral \r\norganizations; the same principle shoud apply to \r\nthe Security Council. A single election that allows \r\na handful of countries to remain on the Council \r\nindefinitely runs counter to the principles of democracy \r\nand accountability. More importantly, it will not enable \r\nthe Council to better reflect changing international \r\npolitical realities in order to effectively address global \r\nchallenges.\r\nThe Uniting for Consensus group, to which the \r\nRepublic of Korea belongs, has shown flexibility in \r\nits proposals for Security Council reform. We would \r\nlike to see progress in the negotiations. The group’s \r\nsuggestion of longer-term re-electable seats could serve \r\nas a viable compromise solution. We look forward to \r\nseeing other negotiating groups take a constructive \r\napproach to move the agenda forward. With regard to \r\nthe matter of procedure, one lesson we can draw from \r\nprevious negotiations is that any reform formula must \r\nenjoy the widest possible support of Member States. We \r\nneed to strive for consensus, as stipulated in decision \r\n62/557, to address that critical matter.\r\nSecurity Council reform must also be addressed \r\nin a comprehensive manner encompassing all five key \r\nareas. The Republic of Korea looks forward to making \r\nprogress in the negotiations on reforming the Council \r\nunder your leadership, Mr. President, as well as that \r\nof Ambassador Courtney Rattray, the newly appointed \r\nfacilitor of the intergovernmental negotations, whom \r\nwe asssure of our full cooperation. We also thank \r\nAmbassador Tanin, the first faciitator, for his untiring \r\nefforts to move the negotiations forward. We will \r\ncontinue to work closely with other Member States on \r\nthis important task.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I would like to start by \r\nthanking you, Mr. President, for your leadership since \r\nyou assumed the post of President in September, in \r\nsteering the important agenda items before us, which \r\ninclude the reform of the Security Council.\r\nAllow me to associate myself fully with the \r\nstatement delivered earlier by Ambassador Antonio \r\nde Aguiar Patriota of Brazil on behalf of the Group \r\nof Four (G4). I would also like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Courtney Rattray of Jamaica as the \r\nnew Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nAmbassador Rattray has already shown his superb \r\nability to build consensus as Chair of the First \r\nCommittee. I extend full support and cooperation to \r\nthe new Chair.\r\n18/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nMy special gratitude goes to the former President of \r\nthe General Assembly, Ambassador John Ashe, and to \r\nthe former Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tahin of Afghanistan. In particular, \r\nAmbassador Tanin worked tirelessly as chair over the \r\npast six years to move the process forward. The third \r\nrevised document, issued in 2011, and his assesssment \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations process issued in \r\nJuly are among his important legacies.\r\nAs pointed out by many speakers before me, with \r\nthe approach of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nfoundation of the United Nations we are facing an \r\nenormous opportunity. Next September will also mark \r\n50 years since the Security Council was reformed for \r\nthe first and only time. All of us here remember the call \r\nfrom our leaders at the 2005 World Summit for early \r\nreform of the Security Council. I believe that now is the \r\ntime to move forward to fulfil the mandate given by our \r\nleaders at that Summit.\r\nWe are all aware that 50 years ago, when the \r\nCouncil was expanded, the membership of the United \r\nNations was 117 countries. Today, we are 193. Despite \r\nthe addition of 76 countries, the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council remains the same. The Council \r\nshould reflect the geopolitical realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century by expanding both permanent and \r\nnon-permanent membership. I strongly believe that \r\nmore countries, most notably those of Africa and the \r\nAsia-Pacific, should be on the Council.\r\nI attach great importance to the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. They provide the only forum where all \r\nMember countries can negotiate for their shared goal \r\nof Security Council reform. The non-paper of the \r\nadvisory group of former President John Ashe, as well \r\nas the former Chair’s assessment, generated postive \r\nmomentum for the negotiations. Despite all the efforts \r\nmade so far, however, we must admit that discussions \r\nare still at a stalemate. We cannot afford for business \r\nas usual to continue in 2015. Let us not make our \r\nnegotiations an endless exercise.\r\nIn order to launch real negotiations under the \r\nleadership of the President and the new Chair, we must \r\nwork on the basis of a negotiation text. I was pleased, \r\nSir, that your letter of 10 November encouraged Member \r\nStates to move the process to text-based negotiations. In \r\nSeptember here in New York, the G-4 Foreign Ministers \r\ndecided to reach out to Member States to discuss \r\nmodels for an enlarged Security Council. I believe that \r\nthat outreach will generate positive momentum for \r\nproducing a negotiating text and that it will revitalize \r\ndiscussion of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nBefore closing, let me refer to the question of the \r\nveto, which is one of the most difficult issues to address \r\nwhen discussing Security Council reform. We have seen \r\nan initiative proposed by France to refrain from using \r\nthe veto in situations of mass atrocities. We welcome \r\nthe French proposal. Its significance lies in the fact that \r\na permanent member of the Council made a proposal \r\nto limit the use of veto power. Japan hopes that other \r\npermanent members will join the French initiative.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to reiterate Japan’s firm \r\nsupport for you, Sir. Japan is resolved to continue \r\ncooperating with you on this crucial issue at this critical \r\nmoment in time.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nThe Chinese delegation wishes to thank you, Sir, \r\nfor convening today’s meeting. We welcome your \r\nappointment of the Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, Ambassador Rattray, as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank Ambassador Tanin of Afghanistan for his efforts \r\nover the past five years as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We support Ambassador Rattray in \r\nhis efforts to carry out work in accordance with his \r\nmandate and in a constructive manner by adhering to \r\na position of impartiality, objectivity and fairness, and \r\nto play a bridging role among members of the General \r\nAssembly and to better serve the Member States.\r\nRecent years have witnessed fundamental and \r\nsignificant changes in international situations and an \r\nincrease in global threats and challenges to humankind. \r\nMember States are placing greater expectations on the \r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council is entrusted \r\nwith the important resonsibiity of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and is fulfilling that \r\nresponsibility on behalf of all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Council’s authority and efficiency \r\nare intrinsically linked to the 193 Member States. \r\nReasonable and necessary Council reform will help it \r\nto better fulfil the sacred responsiblities entrusted to it \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations and to better serve \r\nhumankind’s cause of peace and development.\r\nChina has always actively supported Security \r\nCouncil reform and believes that it should start with \r\nand be based on giving priority to increasing the \r\nrepresentation and voice of developing countries, \r\n14-62259 19/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nespecially those of Africa. At the same time, it should \r\nallow more countries, especially the small and medium-\r\nsized countries that make up the majority of the United \r\nNations membership, to have greater opportunities to \r\nserve the Council, participate in its decision-making \r\nand play a greater role in effectively upholding the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and the guiding \r\nprinciples that govern international relations.\r\nReform of the Council involves the future of the \r\nUnited Nations and the immediate interests of all the \r\nMember States. Promoting progress in the reform \r\nprocess will require Member States to undertake \r\nextensive consultations and accommodate the interests \r\nand needs of all parties, especially those of the small \r\nand medium-sized countries, so as to achieve the \r\nbroadest possible consensus.\r\nChina believes that it is necessary to abide by a \r\nnumber of key principles. \r\nFirst is the principle of unity. The General \r\nAssembly is playing a transitional role at this session by \r\nundertaking the historical mission and unique task of \r\nsummarizing the experience of the past and exploring \r\nnew ways and means to move ahead into the future. \r\nUnity should be the key word at this session. Reform of \r\nthe United Nations in all areas, including reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, cannot make headway amid disputes, \r\naccusations or serious confrontation. All Member States \r\nshould focus on unity with a view to strengthening \r\nthe authority and effectiveness of the Council and \r\nincreasing the representation of developing countries \r\ntherein. It is important to ensure that reform is a process \r\nto iron out differences and strengthen unity. Any unfair \r\ntreatment of the position of Member States, artificial \r\ndeadlines for reform or, worse, the forceful imposition \r\nof immature reform formulas will only exacerbate the \r\ndisputes and division among the Member States, deflect \r\nreform from its correct direction and undermine the \r\ncommon interests of all Member States and the long-\r\nterm interests of the United Nations.\r\nThe second principle is that of ownership of the \r\nMember States. Reform of the Council touches on the \r\ndirect interests of each and every Member State, and \r\nthe process shoud and must be owned and guided by \r\nthem. Intergovernmental negotiations should be carried \r\nout only on the basis of the positions and proposals of \r\nMember States, should treat the proposals of all sides \r\nequally, and accommodate their interests and concerns \r\nin pursuit of the broadest possible consensus. That is the \r\nonly scenario that can ensure the correct direction of the \r\nreform process and guarantee its healthy development. \r\nThe arbitrary reduction of the options for negotiations \r\nand a rush into text-based negotiations without the \r\nconsensus of Member States would only exacerbate \r\nthe division and discord and make the reform process \r\nmore difficult. That is contrary to the expectations of \r\nMember States.\r\nThird is the principle of democratic consultations. \r\nThere is still a lack of consensus among Member States \r\non such matters as the basic concept of reform. With \r\nrespect to either the categories of increased membership \r\nor the scope of the Council, all Member States have \r\ntheir own proposals, and positions and there is a serious \r\ndivergence of views. However, the more divergent the \r\nviews, the more necessary it is for Member States to \r\ncarry out patient consultations aimed at consensus. \r\nWe should turn differences of opinion into the driving \r\nforce and put our heads together as we seek consensus \r\nand try to reach a package deal on the questions related \r\nto reform.\r\nOnly a solution reached through in-depth \r\nconsultations among all Member States and supported \r\nby the majority will be acceptable to the United Nations \r\nmembership. Only a decision jointly made by Member \r\nStates will be able to stand the test of time. Reform \r\nof the Security Council is a thorny and tough issue \r\nof United Nations reform in all fields. The key to \r\nachieving progress in reform is in the hands of Member \r\nStates. Only when they rise above their differences, \r\nmake compromises and accommodate each other’s \r\nconcerns will it be possible for reform to move ahead \r\non the correct track.\r\nChina hopes that Member States will continue at \r\nthis session to abide by decision 62/557 and conduct the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in an open, inclusive \r\nand transparent manner. China will continue to work \r\ntogether with other countries to arrive at a reform \r\nformula that will enjoy the widest possible consensus \r\namong Member States and conform to the long-term \r\ninterests of the United Nations and the common \r\ninterests of its Members.\r\nMr. Sinhaseni (Thailand): Next year will mark the \r\ntenth anniversary of the World Summit, at which our \r\nleaders called for early reform of the Security Council. \r\nIt will also mark the fiftieth anniversary of the entry \r\ninto force, on 31 August 1965, of the amendment to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations that led to the expansion \r\n20/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nof the Security Council from 11 to 15, with an increase \r\nin non-permanent members from 6 to 10. As we all \r\nknow, that amendment was made in response to an \r\nincrease in the United Nations membership from 51 in \r\n1945 to 115 in 1963. Today, there are 193 Members, and \r\nit is possible that the number will increase.\r\nWith the large increase in the membership and \r\nthe tremendous changes in the global geopolitical and \r\ngeo-economic landscape since the inception of the \r\nUnited Nations in 1945, we have all agreed to the reform \r\nof the Council in five areas, as mandated by decision \r\n62/557 of 2008, to bring the Council into line with \r\npresent-day reality. After two decades of negotiations, \r\nfirst under the Ad Hoc Working Group and later under \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiation process, we should \r\nbe in a position to reach consensus on all these five \r\nareas.\r\nWith respect to the categories of membership, \r\nthere is no objection to the expansion of non-permanent \r\nmembers. However, different views remain on the \r\nexpansion of the number of permanent members. On \r\nthe question of the veto, there appears to be growing \r\nsupport for the so-called code of conduct proposed \r\nby France, instead of an outright abolition of the \r\nveto, which is highly unlikely, if not impossible. On \r\nregional representation, there is a clear consensus on \r\nequitable regional representation. Concerning the size \r\nof an enlarged Security Council, there seems to be a \r\nconvergence of views that an enlarged Council should \r\nbe in the mid-twenties. With regard to improving the \r\nworking methods of the Council, there is no objection \r\nto improvement of the working methods either before \r\nor after reform. In fact, improving the Council’s \r\nworking methods should be an ongoing process that is \r\nnot held hostage to overall reform of the Council. On \r\nthe relationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I believe that we all agree that those \r\ntwo principal organs of the United Nations should work \r\nin unison in accordance with their respective mandates, \r\nas given in the Charter.\r\nThe only issue that seems to be holding back the \r\nmuch-needed reform of the Security Council is the \r\nexpansion of the permanent membership. On that \r\nissue, Thailand has always been open to all ideas or \r\nproposals, including the expansion of both categories \r\nof membership or the introduction of so-called interim \r\nor intermediate options. We share the view of a number \r\nof Member States that reform will be possible only \r\nif Member States are willing to be more f lexible and \r\nprepared to engage in give-and-take negotiations. We \r\nare also receptive to the proposal of holding a text-based \r\nnegotiation. However, before we embark upon drafting \r\nany text, all must first agree on the principles for a \r\npossible way forward, especially on the most important \r\nissue of increasing the number of permanent members.\r\nIn our view, it will be very difficult to reach \r\nconsensus on an increase in the number of permanent \r\nmembers, at least in the immediate future, due to the firm \r\nopposition of certain Member States that are skeptical \r\nof the need to add more permanent seats to the Council. \r\nHowever, that does not mean that such an expansion \r\nwill be not possible in the long term. Countries that \r\nwish to become new permanent members must prove \r\nthat they have both the capacity and the commitment to \r\nstrengthening the Council, while the wider membership, \r\non the other hand, should have the right to evaluate \r\nwhether the addition of new permanent members has \r\nany proven merit. Unlike the current five permanent \r\nmembers, which were given permanent seats because \r\nof their historical contribution to bringing an end to \r\nthe Second World War and subsequently establishing \r\na new international organization known today as the \r\nUnited Nations, the new members should be given \r\npermanent seats if they can clearly demonstrate their \r\ncapacity and commitment to maintaining international \r\npeace and security. More importantly, the expansion of \r\nthe permanent membership must prove to be useful in \r\nenhancing the Council’s efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nIn order to give the aspiring permanent members \r\nthe opportunity to demonstrate their capacity and \r\ncommitment, an interim category of membership should \r\nbe introduced to allow them to serve on the Council \r\nfor three to five years, based on conditions and criteria \r\nto be established. If they are re-elected for a second \r\nterm, there could then be a review during or after the \r\nsecond term on the possible expansion of the permanent \r\nmembership. However, the introduction of such interim \r\nseats should not affect the expansion of non-permanent \r\nmembers based on the principle of equitable regional \r\nrepresentation.\r\nAs we will soon mark the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations and the tenth anniversary of the \r\nWorld Summit, Member States need to work together \r\nin the spirit of compromise and f lexibility to ensure \r\nthat the forthcoming eleventh round of negotiations in \r\nthe context of the intergovernmental negotiations will \r\nproduce tangible results and lead to progress. Let me \r\njoin other speakers in thanking and paying tribute to \r\n14-62259 21/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin of Afghanistan for his tireless \r\neffots and the tremendous patience he showed during his \r\nsix years as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nI would also like to warmly congratulate Ambassador \r\nCourtney Rattray of Jamaica on his recent appointment \r\nas the new intergovernmental negotiations Chair. My \r\ndelegation has full confidence in Ambassador Rattray \r\nand wishes him well in his work.\r\nWe need a fresh approach and many new ideas and \r\nproposals to move the reform forward. The repetition of \r\nknown positions leads nowhere. The ideas Thailand has \r\nput forward today are all aimed at breaking the deadlock \r\nby taking on board all the concerns and proposals of all \r\nsides that are either for or against the expansion of the \r\nnumber of permanent seats. Only when that deadlock is \r\nbroken can we finally achieve a much-needed reform of \r\nthe Security Council that is acceptable to all.\r\nMr. Deniau (France) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I should like to welcome the appointment \r\nof Ambassador Ambassador Rattray of Jamaica as \r\nfacilitor of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. We wish him every success \r\nin his mission.\r\nDiscussions on Security Council reform in the \r\nGeneral Assembly have been going on for almost two \r\ndecades now, and we are compelled to note that we \r\nhave made no progress on the issue. Ambassador Tanin \r\nof Afghanistan, to whose work I pay tribute, tried to \r\noffer Member States a concise and concrete document \r\non possible modalities for reform, but no agreement \r\nwas reached to advance specifically on the path to \r\nexpansion of the Council.\r\nAnd yet the discussions at the sixty-eighth session \r\nwithin the framework of intergovernmental negotiations \r\nshowed that a majority of Members of the Organization \r\nwanted reform. The practical arrangements remain to \r\nbe specified, clearly, but it is a significant step forward, \r\nand we now need to move to negotiations based on a text, \r\nas has been emphasized today by the representatives of \r\nGuyana, Brazil, Saint Lucia, Sierra Leone and India.\r\nFrance believes that the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe founding of the Organization should be utilized to \r\nbring the Member States to agreement on an ambitious \r\nreform project. My country hopes that a text will be \r\ncirculated to allow concrete negotiation with a view \r\nto expanding the Security Council in both categories \r\nof membership. Such reform is critical. The Security \r\nCouncil must better reflect the realities of today’s \r\nworld while strengthening its capacity to fully assume \r\nits responsibilities for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nFrance desires the Council to take into account the \r\nemergence of new Powers that are willing and able to \r\ntake responsibility for a permanent seat in the Security \r\nCouncil and are, in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, up to the task of making a significant \r\ncontribution to the action of the Council. In this \r\nrespect, it supports the candidacies of Germany, Brazil, \r\nIndia and Japan as permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, as well as an increased presence of African \r\ncountries among the permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers.\r\nI take this opportunity to remind the Assembly of \r\nthe French initiative on voluntary regulation of the use \r\nof the veto. The ministerial meeting of 25 September on \r\nthe veto, co-chaired by the Foreign Ministers of France \r\nand Mexico, showed that many Member States as well \r\nas civil society support this initiative, in which, I recall, \r\nthe five permanent members of the Security Council \r\nwould refrain voluntarily and collectively from using \r\nthe veto when a situation of mass atrocities has arisen. \r\nThis voluntary approach, as several speakers have \r\nnoted today, does not require a revision of the Charter. \r\nThe discussions on the practicalities of implementation \r\nare continuing with our partners, and France hopes to \r\nreach agreement with the other permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council in the coming months. We will \r\ncontinue in parallel to mobilize its supporters in order \r\nto maintain the momentum already operative.\r\nFinally, I would remind the Assembly that our \r\ninitiative on the veto is distinct and complementary to \r\nthe comprehensive reform of the Council, which is a \r\nreform for which France will continue to advocate.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): Mr. President, I \r\nwould like to thank you for convening today’s debate \r\non agenda item 119, entitled “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters”. My country \r\nfollows this issue of utmost importance. Naturally, my \r\ndelegation greatly appreciates your opening remarks.\r\nI would also like to congratulate Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative \r\nof Jamaica, on his appointment as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and express our commitment to working with \r\nhim to ensure comprehensive reform of the Council. \r\n22/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nI would also like to express our deep appreciation for \r\nthe great efforts undertaken by the previous Chair, \r\nAmbassador Zahir Tanin, in previous sessions.\r\nAlgeria fully aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Iran and Kuwait on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Alignment Movement and the Group \r\nof Arab States, respectively. I now would like, on \r\ninstructions from my Government, to add the following \r\nremarks.\r\nWith regard to the reform of the Security Council, \r\nI reiterate Algeria’s commitment to this very important \r\nissue and state that we look forward to building on what \r\nwas achieved during the past session on the basis of \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 62/557. We are heartened \r\nthat during the general debate in the Assembly’s \r\ncurrent session, many Heads of State and Government \r\nand heads of delegation, including my own Foreign \r\nMinister, reaffirmed the need to reform the Security \r\nCouncil in order to make it more representative, \r\ndemocratic and legitimate. We must now all continue \r\nto seek the goal of reaching an agreement on a reform \r\nmodel that takes into account the core values of the \r\nUnited Nations, specifically inclusiveness, democracy, \r\naccountability, equality and transparency.\r\nCorrecting the present imbalance in the composition \r\nof the Council with a view to transforming it into a \r\nmore legitimate organ primarily responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security remains \r\nthe collective responsibility of all Member States and the \r\nmain objective of the General Assembly. We hope that \r\nat this session the pace will increase for a more frank \r\nand lively debate — one that is more f lexible, willing \r\nto strike compromises and decisive — generating \r\nthe necessary political will that would lead to such a \r\nreform, in accordance with the vision of our leaders \r\nexpressed at the 2005 World Summit.\r\nAlgeria is a member of the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten. On that basis, Algeria actively takes \r\npart in the promotion of the African common position \r\nand continues to engage in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations aimed at correcting the historical injustice \r\nsuffered by Africa as the only continent not represented \r\nin the Security Council’s permanent membership and \r\nunderrepresented in the non-permanent category. To \r\nthat end, we urge the wider United Nations membership \r\nto work with Africa to address this injustice with \r\ninsistence. We are committed to building alliances \r\nin support of the African common position with \r\ndiverse interest groups and Member States engaged \r\nin intergovernmental negotiations with a view to \r\nachieving reform of the Council.\r\nAfrica’s position is a continental aspiration, \r\nwith which we believe all Member States and other \r\nstakeholders are now very familiar. In that regard, \r\nit is important to recall that in 1945, when the \r\nUnited Nations was created, most of Africa was not \r\nrepresented, and when the first reform took place \r\nin 1963 Africa was represented but at the time not \r\nconsidered for inclusion in the permanent category. \r\nCircumstances have changed since then, and it would \r\nmerely be a question of simple justice for Africa to be \r\nfully represented in all decision-making organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, particularly in the Security Council. \r\nFull representation of Africa in the Council, according \r\nto the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, \r\nmeans, first, acquiring no fewer than two permanent \r\nseats, with all the prerogatives and privileges of \r\npermanent membership, including the right of veto if it \r\ncontinues to exist. Secondly, Africa is laying claim to \r\nfive non-permanent seats.\r\nWe note with concern the lack of progress and \r\nconcrete results during the ten rounds of the General \r\nAssembly’s intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Despite that fact, and in the spirit of \r\nour commitment to addressing the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council and other related matters, Algeria is \r\nready to continue to engage constructively and in good \r\nfaith in the intergovernmental negotiations process \r\nduring the current session of General Assembly.\r\nWe also note that in your letter of 10 November, \r\nMr. President, you encourage Member States to move \r\nthe process to text-based negotiations. In that case, my \r\ndelegation still considers the second revision of the \r\ncompiled text a good basis for negotiations. However, \r\nthere is a need for general agreement on what to do \r\nduring the current session, and this debate could help \r\nthe Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations further \r\nclarify his intentions on how to proceed. Security \r\nCouncil reform should be addressed in a comprehensive, \r\ntransparent and balanced manner.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to assure you, \r\nMr. President, of our full support and cooperation \r\nin making more progress on reforming the Security \r\nCouncil under your leadership.\r\n14-62259 23/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nMr. González de Linares Palou (Spain) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would first like to thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor the interest you have shown in working closely with \r\nall the States Members of the United Nations on the \r\nissue of Security Council reform.\r\nWe congratulate Ambassador Rattray warmly on \r\nhis appointment and wish him every success in his \r\nimportant task. He can count on Spain’s full support. \r\nI would also like to express our deep gratitude to his \r\npredecessor, Ambassador Tanin, for his work, tireless \r\nefforts and patience during his term.\r\nWe subscribe fully to the statement delivered on \r\nbehalf of Uniting for Consensus by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Italy and would like to make a few \r\nadditional remarks.\r\nAfter working for a long time on the process of \r\nreforming the Security Council — in my case, since \r\n1993 — my country has learned that our strength comes \r\nfrom unity, while divisive approaches and actions only \r\ncause delays and complicate reform even further. As \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, we all share the \r\ngoal of creating a more representative, accountable, \r\neffective and democratic Security Council, and to \r\nachieve it we must be willing to consider new ideas and \r\nbuild bridges between the various groups and positions. \r\nThe Security Council reform process resembles the \r\nconstruction of a big building. It needs a good, solid \r\nfoundation. If it uses only part of that foundation, \r\nthe building cannot be built, and if it is built, it will \r\ncollapse.\r\nWe are eager to see a modern version of the \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative and \r\ninfluential, and in particular a place where African \r\nand small States can make their voices heard. Spain \r\nbelieves that increasing the Council’s membership will \r\nhelp it be more representative, but much more than that \r\nis needed. It is also essential that we increase every \r\nMember State’s chances of having a seat on the Council \r\nfrom time to time. And the best way to achieve that \r\ngoal is by increasing the number of elected seats, which \r\nwould also make the Security Council more democratic \r\nand accountable to all the Member States of this \r\nOrganization. That does not mean that new permanent \r\nseats should be created, since we believe that will not \r\nmake the Council more representative. On the contrary, \r\nwe would be creating a more exclusive Council rather \r\nthan a more inclusive one, turning our backs on the \r\nneed for greater democracy and accountability in the \r\nCouncil.\r\nWe need a more accountable and effective Council. \r\nThose features go hand in hand. Spain supports the \r\nidea of allowing Member States that wish to make a \r\nsignificant contribution to the Council’s work to serve \r\non it more often and for longer periods of time. Spain \r\nbelieves in a Security Council that is based on merit, \r\nnot privilege. My country supports the Uniting for \r\nConsensus proposal to create seats for longer terms \r\nwith the possibility of immediate re-election. That \r\nformula, we believe, would enable States with the \r\ndesire and ability to contribute more to the Council’s \r\nwork to extend their service on it.\r\nIn conclusion, Spain wishes to reiterate its \r\nwillingness to collaborate with other groups and \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to reach the best \r\npossible solution for achieving a more representative, \r\naccountable, effective and democratic Security Council.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of my delegation, I would first like to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this meeting.\r\nI would like to express Argentina’s support for \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Italy \r\non behalf of Uniting for Consensus. I would also like \r\nto offer our thanks to Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\nAfghanistan for his work in the past few years leading \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, and to warmly \r\nwelcome and congratulate Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray of Jamaica on his appointment to the position. \r\nHe can count on the Argentine delegation’s full \r\ncooperation and constructive efforts in his work as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nAs others have pointed out, the process of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform has been framed by the content of resolutions \r\n48/26 and 53/30 and decision 62/557. The discussions \r\nhave enabled us to exhaustively analyse the five main \r\nissues: membership categories, the veto question, \r\nregional representation, the size and working methods \r\nof an expanded Security Council, and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. Those \r\nissues are interrelated and cannot be tackled separately, \r\nsince they are all parts of a single package.\r\nThe areas of convergence are well known. The \r\nfirst, clearest and most basic is the absolute necessity \r\nof reforming the Security Council and ending the status \r\nquo. An unreformed Council is obsolete. Its loss of \r\nlegitimacy, effectiveness and relevance affects the entire \r\nOrganization. There are other areas of convergence, \r\n24/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nof course, with the Council’s working methods being \r\na clear example that we must work to improve and \r\nmake more transparent. Another is the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly. And \r\nto a lesser extent, there is also convergence on the \r\nnumber of members on an expanded Council. But \r\nnone of those three areas presents differences that are \r\ninsoluble or insurmountable. At the same time, the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process has identified \r\nother aspects on which we have divergent positions, in \r\nparticular on the membership categories and the issue \r\nof the veto.\r\nWith respect to the first issue — the categories of \r\nmembership — my country believes that the reform \r\nshould not allow for new permanent members or create \r\nexclusive categories. We are of the view that this type of \r\nseat, that is to say permanent seats, does not necessarily \r\nguarantee greater participation by those who at present \r\nare not represented in the Council. At the same time, we \r\nbelieve that any formula must include the concept of a \r\nlegitimate democratic and representative process, with \r\nelections as a fundamental element.\r\nThe phase now beginning is positive. It will \r\nenable us to pragmatically and rationally explore the \r\npossibilities afforded us by the so-called intermediary \r\nsolution. In so doing, we will achieve a compromise that \r\nsatisfies all Member States, respecting the principles of \r\ntransparency, good faith, mutual respect, openness and \r\ninclusiveness.\r\nWith regard to the issue of the veto, since the 1945 \r\nnegotiations at the San Francisco Conference and with \r\ngreater emphasis at the first session of the General \r\nAssembly, in October 1946, and the second session, \r\nin 1947, Argentina established a very firm position \r\nagainst the veto. There is no doubt as to our position. \r\nIn the years that followed, my delegation reiterated \r\nthat same position repeatedly. But at the same time, we \r\nbelieve that, given the fact that eliminating the veto is \r\nnot possible at this point, formulas that would seek to \r\nperpetuate it or extend it to new members should not be \r\naccepted.\r\nWe must reach a comprehensive solution, not by \r\nphases or in an incomplete manner. As I said earlier, \r\nall the issues are linked and cannot be dealt with \r\nseparately. We all know that in any negotiating process, \r\nintransigent positions do not lead to any result. We \r\nhave the opportunity to overcome the impasse and the \r\nlack of progress. We call on all delegations to follow \r\nthe example of Uniting for Consensus, as expressed \r\nby the representative of Italy this morning, to show \r\nflexibility and readiness to work on innovative and \r\nconsistent formulas that will ensure a more democratic \r\npresence in the Council, based on rotation among \r\nthe non-permanent members, and to reformulate the \r\nworking methods so that the Council can be more \r\ndemocratic, fair and transparent.\r\nIn closing, my delegation wishes to once again \r\nreiterate the Argentine Government”s intention to \r\ncompromise, to remain open to any approach that can \r\nbrings positions closer together and that can bring \r\nabout the much-needed reform of the Security Council. \r\nMy country is confident that under your leadership, \r\nMr. President, and that of Ambassador Rattray, we can \r\ntake the first steps on the path to agreement.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council and for your decision \r\nto separate this discussion from that on the Council’s \r\nannual report to the General Assembly. They are issues \r\nthat deserve their own space and separate discussions.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Italy on behalf of Uniting for \r\nConsensus.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the new facilitator of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, and extends to him its support and willingness \r\nto work towards our common goal — an outcome that is \r\nacceptable to all. We also thank Ambassador Tanin for \r\nhis leadership in this process over the past five years.\r\nOver 20 years of discussions, we have found that \r\nthe most important quality for a facilitator on this \r\nissue is the ability to listen to the positions of Member \r\nStates with impartiality, transparency and objectivity, \r\nand on that basis determine the way that will allow \r\nfor agreement to be reached on a solution that has the \r\nwidest possible support. The facilitator also needs \r\nf lexibility on the part of States to move towards that \r\ncommon goal. Without f lexibility or willingness to \r\ncompromise, the facilitator’s room to manoeuver is \r\nreduced to a minimum. In such a scenario, we cannot \r\nwait for the person directing the process to interpret \r\nthe various positions or, worse, discard or minimize \r\nproposals submitted by delegations.\r\nListening to the Member States does not mean \r\nseeking to impose summary documents with artificial \r\n14-62259 25/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\ntimetables. The document length does not determine \r\ndelegations’ level of f lexibility, and imposing a \r\ntimetable fosters distrust, generates larger divisions \r\nand focuses our discussions on the form and not the \r\nsubstance of this debate. Security Council reform is a \r\nprocess that can be guided only by all Member States, \r\nand not just a few. It is a process that, in order to move \r\nforward, must start from common positions. The the \r\nsecond revision of the document and the expansion of \r\nthe number of non-permanent Council members are the \r\nonly elements that, after 20 years of discussions, all \r\nMember States have been able to agree on, and therefore \r\nthey constitute two pillars on the basis of which to \r\nresume our negotiations with f lexibility and without \r\nassuming an outcome that has been pre-designed to \r\nfavour a few Member States.\r\nSecurity Council reform is also an urgent process. \r\nCouncil inaction in recent crises has had significant \r\nconsequences. It is a paralysis that often prevents it \r\nfrom responding in a timely and effectively manner, \r\nand we must correct that. That is why France and \r\nMexico convened and co-hosted a discussion during the \r\nhigh-level week of the sixty-ninth session on restricting \r\nthe use of the veto in situations of war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity or genocide. That initiative is a step \r\nin the right direction and provides the five permanent \r\nmembers the opportunity to renew their commitment \r\nto the primary responsibility of the Council — the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThroughout the negotiations process, Uniting for \r\nConsensus has reviewed and outlined reform models \r\nthat can meet the expectations of the majority of \r\nMember States. Uniting for Consensus has focused \r\non listening to the voices and taking into account the \r\ninterests of small States, including small island and \r\ndeveloping countries, which have faced enormous \r\nchallenges to date in seeking to be elected as members \r\nof the Council. We are also sensitive to the expectations \r\nof those States aspiring to play a more important role in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security.\r\nMexico and Uniting for Consensus do not seek to \r\nimpose their vision on the rest of the membership. We \r\nwant to achieve a compromise with which the highest \r\nnumber of Member States can identify. We oppose \r\npermanence and therefore promote a clear and simple \r\nproposal, with additional seats allocated on the basis of \r\nthe principle of equitable geographical representation \r\nand mandates longer than the current two years, with \r\nthe possibility of immediate re-election.\r\nMexico conceives of a Security Council with \r\n26 members, where, in addition to the five permanent \r\nmembers, there are six countries from Africa, five from \r\nAsia, four from the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nGroup, three from the Group of Western European and \r\nother States, two from the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates and one small island developing State or other \r\nsmall State. We believe that this proposal and its details \r\nwith respect to election of regular members and those \r\nwith broader mandates, the decision-making processes \r\nin the Council, the various perspectives on working \r\nmethods, and the relationship between the Council and \r\nthe General Assembly would reconcile the aspirations \r\nof all parties while, on the one hand, adjusting the \r\ncomposition of the Council to new regional realities \r\nand, on the other, securing a broader presence than \r\nusual for those States willing to serve more frequently \r\non the Council. This model provides a sufficient \r\nmargin of action to negotiate and ensure appropriate \r\nregional representation for all underrepresented groups \r\nwhile also preserving the principles of transparency \r\nand accountability.\r\nAs Latin Americans, we understand perfectly \r\nthe aspirations of the African Group to equitable \r\nrepresentation that would allow it to play its rightful \r\nrole in the Council. We conceive of their legitimate \r\nclaim as an expression of the strength that gives them \r\nunity and consensus, and not as an individual aspiration \r\nto power and privilege.\r\nAs we begin a new cycle in the process of \r\nnegotiations, Mexico would reiterate the five core \r\nprinciples or criteria that have regulated and will \r\ncontinue to guide our participation in this process: \r\nfirst, to improve the representativeness of the Security \r\nCouncil by adding new elected members on the basis \r\nof equitable geographical distribution while preserving \r\nthe accountability of these members through regular \r\nelections; secondly, improve balance in the Council’s \r\ndecision-making process through a prolonged presence \r\nof elected members; thirdly, improve the access of all \r\nStates to the Security Council through an appropriate \r\nexpansion while preserving its efficiency; fourthly, \r\nimprove the Council’s effectiveness by promoting \r\nmeasures to limit the use of the veto by the permanent \r\nmembers; and fifthly, improve the Council’s \r\ntransparency by reforming its working methods and its \r\nrelationship with the General Assembly. Accordingly, \r\nMexico supports the proposals of the Accountability, \r\n26/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nCoherence and Transparency Group on those topics and \r\nconsiders them to be an excellent point of departure.\r\nWe commend you, Mr. President, in considering \r\nand being guided by these premises to revive the current \r\nprocess in the interest of achieving the reform that we \r\nall hope for. The reform of the Security Council will not \r\nbe achieved if new privileges are granted in perpetuity \r\nto some States in order to meet national ambitions. \r\nUndoubtedly, a new Security Council should be based \r\non merit and not on privilege. We are confident that, \r\nin the full awareness of the divergent positions on \r\nthis matter, your able leadership, Sir, and that of the \r\nfacilitator will guide us to the compromise solution that \r\nwe all hope for. Both nationally and in the Uniting for \r\nConsensus movement, Mexico will maintain its active \r\nand constructive participation with openness and \r\nabsolute transparency.\r\nMr. Ruiz (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I would \r\nlike to begin, Sir, by thanking you for calling for an \r\nextension of the intergovernmental negotiation process \r\nin a constructive manner. \r\nI align myself with the statement made by \r\nAmbassador Cardi on behalf of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus Group. \r\nI wish to thank Ambassador Tanin for his dedication \r\nover the past five years and welcome Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray of Jamaica as our new facilitator, as \r\nhe is from a country of the Group of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States. Familiar as we are with his \r\nproven diplomatic abilities, we are confident that his \r\ninput and impartiality will safeguard the transparency \r\nof the process.\r\nAs we all know, the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess has gone on much longer than we would have \r\nwished, but that does not mean it is any less constructive, \r\nas it has enabled us to participate in a dialogue in which \r\nwe have been able to know fully the positions of the \r\nother groups. In that regard, my delegation believes \r\nthat it pertinent to highlight that over the 10 rounds of \r\nnegotiations so far, it has become clear that constructive \r\nengagement of the various groups and the need to show \r\nflexibility are the cornerstones for progress in the \r\nprocess and for the achievement of concrete outcomes.\r\nTo get there, and recognizing the difficulties \r\ninherent in reforming the Security Council, we believe \r\nit timely to explore the possibilities of ensuring that \r\nthe process will be more agile, allowing for better \r\nexchange of ideas and leading thereby to progress. All \r\nof that would be undertaken with respect for and in the \r\nframework of the clear provisions set out in decision \r\n62/557. Colombia supports the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process based on the 2009 consensus, \r\nwhich are reflected in the provisions of that decision.\r\nIn view of the foregoing, we take this opportunity \r\nto invite all delegations and groups to show flexibility \r\nand openness in order to engage in an inclusive process \r\nand reach a democratic consensus. I should also say \r\nthat inclusiveness and democratic consensus are the \r\ntwo pillars upon which Colombia’s position of principle \r\non the reform process is based. We also firmly believe \r\nin the sovereign equality of States. Since the San \r\nFrancisco Conference at which the Organization was \r\nfounded, and through each of the 25 representatives \r\nwho have led the Colombian delegation to date, as well \r\nas the seven opportunities we have had to serve in the \r\nSecurity Council, Colombia has always called for the \r\nCouncil to be more representative, accountable and \r\ntransparent.\r\nHowever, as we all know, the world in which the \r\nUnited Nations was born in 1945 is very different \r\nfrom that of today, and the historical and geopolitical \r\nconditions in which the only reform that has been \r\npossible to date, which took place 51 years ago, have \r\nchanged beyond recognition. That is why we have to \r\nask ourselves whether the proposals on the negotiating \r\ntable are the best way forward for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, given the challenges \r\nposed by unprecedented humanitarian crises, \r\ntransborder criminal networks and terrorism, as well \r\nas the need for peacekeeping operations to evolve and \r\nbe more effective. Are these the discussions that can \r\nlead to the establishment of a Security Council that is \r\nadapted to the new realities?\r\nAs far as my country is concerned, we must have \r\ncomprehensive, transparent, balanced and equitable \r\nnegotiations that reflect the needs and interests of all \r\nMember States, especially developing countries, which \r\ncannot continue to be underrepresented in the Security \r\nCouncil. We must recognize that through the reform \r\nprocess we must create more space and opportunities \r\nto ensure the participation of all States on an equal \r\nfooting, without any privileges for just a few.\r\nIn closing, I wish to reiterate the readiness of my \r\ndelegation to continue to work towards a reform that \r\nwould endow the Organization with a Security Council \r\n14-62259 27/28\r\n12/11/2014 A/69/PV.49\r\nthat is legitimate, inclusive and guided by democratic \r\nprinciples.\r\nMr. Akinterinwa (Nigeria): Mr. President, we \r\nrecall that on your election on 11 June 2014 you \r\nremarked that the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform had not made the desired \r\nprogress and you assured us that you would work \r\nwith Member States to make further progress on \r\nthis important issue (see A/68/PV.93). My delegation \r\ntherefore especially commends you for convening this \r\nmeeting and for your determination to move the process \r\nforward during the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session. \r\nWe should also recall, Mr. President, that during your \r\naddress at the start of the session on 16 September (see \r\nA/69/PV.1), you stated that one of your priorities would \r\nbe a continued focus on Security Council reform, and \r\nyou stressed the urgency of the need for that reform, \r\nbased on the 2005 World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1). Today’s meeting and other steps you have taken \r\nin this direction are indeed practical demonstrations of \r\nyour firm commitment to the process.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by Ambassador Vandi Minah, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Sierra Leone, and Ambassador \r\nMenissa Rambally, the Permanent Representative of \r\nSaint Lucia, on behalf, respectively, of the African \r\nGroup on the common African position, and the L.69 \r\nGroup.\r\nWe commend Ambassador Tanin of Afghanistan \r\non his exemplary leadership of the past 10 rounds of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, and welcome the \r\nappointment of Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, as Chair of the \r\neleventh round. We would like to assure him of our \r\ncooperation. It is our sincere hope that this round will \r\nadvance the discussions to a new level and will not end \r\nthe way previous rounds of negotiations have.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is inspired by \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nclear objective of the process is based on the sovereign \r\nequality of all Member States and on the importance \r\nof adhering to the principles of democratization and \r\ninclusiveness in the United Nations. It is nevertheless \r\na paradox that our past efforts to move the process \r\nof negotiation on the subject to a text-based stage \r\nhave been hampered by a lack of consensus, making \r\nthe annual rounds of negotiations a mere academic \r\nexercise, with no real results achieved.\r\nIt is now 10 years since the 2005 World Summit, \r\nwhen leaders collectively called for speedy reform of \r\nthe Council. We should therefore have a progress report, \r\nalong with a negotiation text, to submit for our leaders’ \r\nconsideration when they meet at the 2015 summit, \r\nwhich will also mark the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations. The outcome of \r\nthe eleventh round of negotiations should therefore \r\nunderscore our commitment to reforming the Council, \r\nas the relevant resolutions and the inclination of all \r\nMember States demand.\r\nAs the previous intergovernmental negotiations \r\ndemonstrated, it is obvious that an overwhelming \r\nmajority of delegations supports expansion of the \r\nCouncil in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership. What is required of us at this \r\njuncture is that we move to the stage of real negotiations \r\nwith the aid of a working document. For that reason, \r\nwe would like to highlight our expectation that during \r\nthe eleventh round of negotiations we will ensure \r\nthat we move to the stage of text-based negotiations. \r\nOtherwise there will be no significant departure from \r\nour experience in the past 10 rounds.\r\nNigeria has continued to express its support for \r\nadvancing the intergovernmental negotiation process \r\nin an open, inclusive and transparent manner, and my \r\ndelegation accordingly calls on all parties to be prepared \r\nto display openness and f lexibility in order to make \r\nconcessions that will enable us to find common ground \r\nand move the process forward in a progressive manner. \r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm the \r\nAfrican common position, as expressed in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, which we strongly support. We also wish \r\nto underscore the overriding importance of ensuring \r\nthat Africa’s interests continue to be advanced and \r\nsafeguarded during this new process.\r\nThe Group of African States supports comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council, particularly in the area \r\nof membership. In that connection, the Group demands \r\ntwo seats in the permanent category and an additional \r\ntwo in the non-permanent category. This is important \r\nif we are to correct the historical injustice done to the \r\ncontinent and its marginalization over many years. In \r\naddition, Africa advocates that the prerogative of the \r\nveto be abolished, but if it must continue to exist, it \r\nshould be extended to new permanent members as well.\r\nAs we look forward to fruitful deliberations and \r\nconcrete results from the eleventh round of negotiations, \r\n28/28 14-62259\r\nA/69/PV.49 12/11/2014\r\nwe will continue to count on your leadership, Sir, in \r\nsteering the process successfully this time to a logical \r\nconclusion.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
