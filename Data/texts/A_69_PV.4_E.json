It is a great privilege and honour to \r\nwelcome everyone present in the General Assembly \r\ntoday.\r\nAt the outset, let me pay tribute to the indigenous \r\npeoples of this land — the Haudenosaunee, also known \r\nas the Six Nations or Iroquois. I also wish to send a \r\nwarm embrace to indigenous peoples around the world. \r\nI am truly honoured to preside over this Conference, \r\nwhich must focus on the challenges facing indigenous \r\npeoples and on renewed commitments by Member \r\nStates to address them.\r\nThe World Conference on Indigenous Peoples \r\nis a culmination of the dynamic interface between \r\nthe United Nations and the indigenous peoples of the \r\nworld over the past 50 years. The process leading to \r\nthis Conference has been unprecedented in the history \r\nof the Organization, as it has involved the active \r\nparticipation of indigenous peoples in its preparation \r\nas well as cooperation between Member States and \r\nindigenous peoples in the preparation of the draft \r\noutcome document. We are indeed heartened by the \r\ninclusive nature of the preparatory process, which \r\nbodes well for the implementation of post-Conference \r\ncommitments.\r\nFor more than 30 years, indigenous peoples’ issues \r\nhave been a preoccupation at the United Nations. \r\nNegotiations between Member States and indigenous \r\nleaders, under the auspices of the United Nations \r\nWorking Group on Indigenous Populations, were \r\nindeed long and protracted, but they eventually led to \r\nthe General Assembly’s adoption of the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in \r\n2007.\r\nMost important, the Declaration represents a global \r\nconsensus on indigenous peoples’ rights and affirms \r\ntheir right to self-determination. Furthermore, it accords \r\npre-eminence to collective rights in international \r\nhuman rights law and serves to galvanize international \r\nattention on the protection of both the individual and \r\ncollective rights of indigenous peoples.\r\nIt is important to note the valuable contributions \r\nof the institutional arrangements that have served to \r\ntranslate the objectives of the Declaration into reality \r\nand fostered specific policies on how the United Nations \r\nshould engage with and support the aspirations of \r\nindigenous peoples. Particularly, I would like to mention \r\nthe contributions of the United Nations Permanent \r\nForum on Indigenous Issues, the Inter-Agency Support \r\nGroup on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues, the Special \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.4\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n4th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 22 September 2014, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nRapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples and the \r\nExpert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\r\nAt a national level, there have been many \r\ndeclarations of commitments, policies and legislative \r\nactions to improve the conditions of indigenous peoples. \r\nYet there continues to be a deep chasm between those \r\ncommitments and reality. The World Conference should \r\nserve as a turning point for translating the Declaration \r\ninto concrete action.\r\nThe draft outcome document, which we will adopt \r\ntoday, is another pact between indigenous peoples and \r\nMember States that builds on the Declaration. It is \r\ncarefully crafted and comprises many action-oriented \r\ncommitments directed towards addressing the gaps \r\nin the implementation of the Declaration. Included \r\namong the commitments are a system-wide action \r\nplan to ensure coherence in the various efforts towards \r\nrealization of the provisions of the Declaration, as well \r\nas a call for enhancing the participation of indigenous \r\npeoples and their representative institutions at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis World Conference is an opportunity for \r\nMember States to engage indigenous peoples in a more \r\nstrategic and beneficial manner. That will require \r\nMember States to make greater efforts to translate the \r\ndraft outcome document into reality and to demonstrate \r\nresolve in addressing inequities that adversely affect \r\nindigenous communities. Member States must also \r\nfollow through on capacity-building commitments that \r\nwill allow indigenous peoples to manage their own \r\naffairs.\r\nIn conclusion, let me urge Member States, \r\nintergovernmental organizations, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector to make a renewed commitment towards \r\nstrategic partnership with indigenous peoples to help in \r\ntheir quest for a sustainable future,\r\nI now give the f loor to Secretary-General Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I wish to thank those \r\nattending for coming to the United Nations for this \r\nhistoric, first-ever World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples. I am going to greet the General Assembly in \r\na few indigenous languages. I am sorry that I cannot \r\nspeak in every language represented in the Assembly, \r\nbut please consider this my way of welcoming each \r\nperson.\r\nTakahi (Taíno — Latin America), Aweh (South \r\nAfrica), Kia ora (New Zealand), Buorre beaivvi \r\n(Saami — Norway and Sweden), Hao (Lakota — North \r\nAmerica), Kopisanangani (Dusun-Sabah, Malaysia).\r\nThis is the most important week of the year at the \r\nUnited Nations, and this Conference is one of our most \r\nimportant events because it connects so much of our \r\nmost critical work. Indigenous peoples are concerned \r\nabout issues that top the global agenda. They are deeply \r\nconnected to Mother Earth, whose future is at the heart \r\nof the Climate Summit opening tomorrow. Indigenous \r\npeoples are central to our discourse on human rights \r\nand global development. The Assembly’s deliberations \r\nand decisions will reverberate across the international \r\ncommunity with concrete effects in the lives of \r\nindigenous people. The success of this Conference is \r\nintegral to progress for all humankind.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nIn order to prepare myself for this Conference, I \r\nmet with many indigenous leaders to listen to the things \r\nthey were concerned about and to learn from their \r\nexperiences.\r\nIn June, I went to Bolivia, a country that has \r\nmade enormous progress in the areas of the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples. President Morales was a decisive \r\ndriving force for this conference.\r\nThe people of El Torno were very warm and \r\ngenerous. I was very much impressed by their wealth \r\nof culture. They taught me about the relationship of \r\nrespect between indigenous peoples and nature. This \r\ncould be summed up in the expression that I adopted in \r\nBolivia: “Good living,” which means to live well, but in \r\na simpler way.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn July, I held talks with indigenous leaders in \r\nCosta Rica. The former Permanent Representative of \r\nCosta Rica, Eduardo Ulibarri, also actively promoted \r\nthis conference. We had a meaningful, open discussion. \r\nI listened closely to what the indigenous leaders had to \r\nsay. They were worried about land, resources and their \r\nrights. I repeated my pledge to address the exclusion \r\nand marginalization facing many indigenous peoples \r\naround the world.\r\nEarlier this month, I was in New Zealand, where I \r\ntravelled to Taupo to spend a day with Maori leaders. \r\nThey were using their great respect for nature to build \r\n14-54394 3/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nprosperity. I was impressed by their multimillion-dollar \r\nhorticulture, waste-management and energy-production \r\ncompanies. I will never forget how every bit of waste \r\nis fed to worms that create very rich organic fertilizer. \r\nThat is sustainability in action. It showed how much the \r\nworld can learn from indigenous peoples.\r\nI will continue visiting indigenous communities and \r\nhearing from their leaders, and they will always have a \r\nhome at the United Nations. I am proud that the General \r\nAssembly adopted the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295) during my first \r\nyear in office. That set minimum standards for the \r\nsurvival, dignity and well-being of indigenous peoples. \r\nMore and more countries are reflecting those principles \r\nin their laws and constitutions. United Nations agencies \r\nhave also developed specific policies to guide our work \r\nfor indigenous peoples, and we are joining forces with \r\nindigenous peoples to reach our common goals.\r\nI am pleased to welcome representatives of our \r\nleading experts, the Permanent Forum on Indigenous \r\nIssues, and the Special Rapporteur and the Expert \r\nMechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. I am \r\nsure they would agree that it is important to get pledges \r\nfrom Governments — but it is even more important to \r\nsee actions. That is why I am encouraged that the draft \r\nconference outcome document (A/69/L.1) contains \r\naction-oriented commitments to bridge the gap between \r\npromises and results. I thank all the indigenous peoples \r\nand Governments that cooperated in good faith to \r\nproduce that draft. And I expect Member States to meet \r\ntheir commitments, including by carrying out national \r\naction plans to realize our shared vision.\r\nI welcome the outcome document’s direct requests \r\nto me. I will also consult the rest of the United Nations \r\nsystem on the way forward. We will work closely with \r\nall of the indigenous peoples and the Member States. \r\nThe outcome document also requests that I develop \r\nconcrete proposals to enable indigenous peoples and \r\ntheir institutions to more directly participate in our \r\nUnited Nations activities. That is critical for indigenous \r\ncommunities — and for our world. The outcome \r\ndocument also asks me to appoint a high-level official \r\non indigenous peoples. I will give that my most serious \r\nconsideration. The United Nations will do everything \r\npossible to support indigenous peoples — and we count \r\non their engagement in our global drive for a more \r\nsustainable future.\r\nI began with greetings in a few indigenous \r\nlanguages. I know there are thousands of others. Some \r\nof them are in danger of extinction. I am proud that \r\nthe Declaration has been translated beyond the United \r\nNations’ six official languages into 50 other languages. \r\nI hope we can add many more to the long list. At \r\nthe same time, I count on the indigenous peoples to \r\nspeak with one voice. A long-time indigenous activist \r\nand former member of the Permanent Forum, Tonya \r\nGonnella Frichner, once said: “Indigenous peoples all \r\nspeak many different languages but in our meetings, we \r\nare speaking one language. Our relationship to Mother \r\nEarth is identical.”\r\nI urge the indigenous peoples to join their voices in \r\na harmonious chorus to secure their rights and protect \r\nour planet. The United Nations stands with them in this \r\nstruggle.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis multilingual statement.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.\r\nPresident Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI offer special wishes to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, to the President of the General Assembly, to \r\nall the representatives of States Members of the United \r\nNations and to the representatives of the indigenous \r\npeoples of the world who are here and those who are \r\nlistening to this first World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples.\r\nFirst, on behalf of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, \r\nI would like to thank and congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for having ensured for us the convening of \r\nthis first official summit of the United Nations on \r\nindigenous peoples. I would like to say to all here, and \r\nto those listening, that the fundamental principles of the \r\nindigenous movement are life, Mother Earth and peace. \r\nThose fundamental principles of indigenous peoples \r\nthroughout the world are constantly being threatened \r\nby a system, the capitalist system, a model of how one \r\ncan put an end to life and Mother Earth itself. That is \r\nwhy I want to say to all of my brothers and sisters that \r\nI have come here to share with them some experiences \r\nthat I have had during my short period of ruling Bolivia \r\nas a President who comes from the social movement, \r\nthe indigenous people’s movement.\r\nIn the history of Bolivia, indigenous people have \r\nbeen the most hated, humiliated, vilified, marginalized \r\nand discriminated against. Thanks to the struggle \r\nand awareness of my brothers, not just the indigenous \r\n4/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nmovement but also the social movements have had an \r\nopportunity to share experiences in order to defend life \r\nand change the models that so threaten life and nature \r\nitself.\r\nI would like to tell the Assembly first of all that, \r\nhistorically in Bolivia, the indigenous movement was \r\nable only to vote, but not to govern. In this short time, \r\nwe have shown that the indigenous movement does not \r\nexist simply to vote in elections, but also to govern. \r\nThanks to the struggle of social movements, politics is \r\nno longer a business or a reward. Politics now means \r\nservice, commitment and, beyond that, sacrifice on \r\nbehalf of our peoples.\r\nSecondly, those who govern the world need to govern \r\nby obeying their people and by working in collaboration \r\nwith their people and with social movements. Our people \r\nand nations cannot be governed by bankers, powerful \r\nbusinessmen or multinational corporations. Bolivia \r\nis the first and only country to have incorporated the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples into its legislation. The Declaration was given \r\nlegal status in the Plurinational State of Bolivia in \r\n2007. Likewise, the rights of indigenous peoples were \r\nincorporated into our Constitution, which was approved \r\nby referendum in 2009.\r\nThirdly, the natural resources so generously \r\nbestowed upon us by our Mother Earth should benefit \r\nall. Bolivia’s oil revenues in 2005, before I became \r\nPresident, totalled $300 million. This year, following \r\nthe nationalization of petrochemicals, oil revenues \r\nwill exceed $6 billion. Quite frankly and with all due \r\nsincerity, I would like to let Members know that neither \r\nI nor our Vice-President nor the Cabinet realized how \r\nquickly the economic situation of our country would \r\nchange. By nationalizing hydrocarbons, we freed \r\nourselves economically from the gendarmes of the \r\nworld economy, by which I mean the World Bank and, \r\nespecially, the International Monetary Fund. Before, \r\nour economic policy was decided by those international \r\ninstitutions, which follow a model whose primary aim \r\nis the exploitation of our natural resources.\r\nFourthly, another important theme is climate \r\nchange, which has become one of the most serious \r\nproblems for the planet and for humanity. The best \r\nway to combat climate change is through the policies, \r\nexperience and traditions of the indigenous movement, \r\nwhich are based on solidarity, complementarity and, \r\nmost important of all, a lifestyle in harmony with \r\nMother Earth. For indigenous peoples, the paradigm \r\nof living well means living well with oneself, with our \r\ncommunities and in harmony with nature.\r\nFifthly, indigenous peoples need to be the actors of \r\nchange, in accord with their own models of development, \r\nwith respect for the social, cultural, economic and \r\njudicial plurality of all peoples. We need to strengthen \r\nthe links that unite us and to draw on our shared energy \r\nto build a culture of brotherhood, peace and life.\r\nSixthly, we need to tend and protect the world’s \r\nagricultural lands and forests in order to promote the \r\nfull productive potential of our territories, above all \r\nthose that belong to indigenous peoples. Indigenous \r\npeoples must likewise strengthen our capacity to \r\nfeed all the nations of the world with our organic and \r\necological products.\r\nFinally, it is imperative for the indigenous \r\npeoples of the world to achieve the full exercise of \r\ntheir individual and collective rights to their land and \r\nterritories. We need to overcome our limitations with \r\nregard to development through access to education, \r\nhealth care, water, waste disposal and all basic services. \r\nThanks to the economic improvement in my country \r\nand to the satellite systems we have installed, some of \r\nour brothers and sisters from isolated places — men \r\nand women who had never even seen the capital city \r\nof their province — are now better served and better \r\nconnected, although not all of their demands have been \r\nfully met. It is difficult to meet everyone’s demands in \r\na short time frame, but change has begun to come to the \r\nvarious communities of Bolivia. Before, there was no \r\ntelephone, no potable drinking water and no electricity. \r\nThere was no television and no radio. Now, more than \r\n80 per cent of our provinces and communities have \r\npotable water. Telecommunications reach more than \r\n90 per cent. The major weakness remains the lack of \r\nirrigation systems. Meeting that need remains one of \r\nour responsibilities.\r\nIt is critical for all the world’s Governments to \r\nfurther the process of overcoming and eradicating \r\nthe conditions of extreme poverty and discrimination \r\nthat still affect indigenous peoples, as well as to find \r\nsolutions to the structural problems of poverty that \r\nmany of those peoples still face. We have reduced the \r\npoverty rate from 38 per cent to 18 per cent, a historic \r\nrecord for Bolivia in terms of eradicating poverty.\r\nIndigenous peoples have continuously resisted the \r\nprocesses of colonization in our countries and have \r\nalways preserved the culture of life. We have learned \r\n14-54394 5/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nto live in harmony and equilibrium with Mother Earth, \r\nand we are humanity’s moral reserve. This global \r\nconference should be the starting point for defining our \r\ncollective action in defence of life and for launching \r\na process of transformation and change based on the \r\nwisdom and science of our indigenous peoples, working \r\ndirectly in concert with the technology and scientific \r\nadvances of our time.\r\nBrothers and sisters, it is important, in the interest \r\nof our collective freedom, for me to share our small \r\nexperience after taking on the responsibility of working \r\nfor my country. We have to free ourselves politically \r\nin order to free ourselves economically. The Assembly \r\nknows perfectly well that throughout history there have \r\nbeen various empires that have sought to dominate us \r\npolitically in order to steal from us for their own gain. \r\nHappily, political liberation through a democratic and \r\ncultural revolution has been crucial for our economic \r\nliberation and has enabled us to meet our people’s \r\ndemands. I am grateful to the United Nations and the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the opportunity to participate \r\nin this international event for the world indigenous \r\nmovement.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia for his statement.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, who will speak on behalf of the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States.\r\nPresident Niinistö: I am honoured to address the \r\nfirst United Nations World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples. The participation of representatives of \r\nindigenous peoples in this Conference and in its \r\npreparations makes this event special for all of us. It \r\nreinforces our joint commitment to the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \r\n(resolution 61/295).\r\nIn addition, this Conference marks an important \r\nstep in fulfilling a key recommendation made in Alta, \r\nNorway, a year ago. Indigenous peoples should have \r\nthe right to participate in matters concerning them at \r\nthe United Nations. We look forward to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals in that regard. In that context, we \r\nmust express our concern over the reported attempts to \r\nprevent the representatives of indigenous peoples from \r\nRussia from joining us today.\r\nIndigenous peoples’ participation in decision-making \r\nis vital also at the national level. Procedures may vary \r\nfrom country to country, but in all cases the objective \r\nshould be to reach consensus in good faith. In Finland \r\nauthorities are obliged by law to negotiate with the Sami \r\nParliament, the representative body of the indigenous \r\nSami people. Recently, the Finnish Government worked \r\ntogether with the Sami Parliament to expand the scope \r\nof the obligation to consult. The proposed reform spells \r\nout the concept of free, prior and informed consent.\r\nToday, as we recall the words of former Secretary-\r\nGeneral Kofi Annan, “Let us ensure that all young \r\npeople have every opportunity to participate fully \r\nin the lives of their societies”, we are witnessing the \r\nimportant role being played in this Conference by \r\nyoung indigenous delegates. Indigenous youth must \r\nhave the right, means and support to participate in their \r\nsocieties. To that end, access to education, information \r\nand the means of communication is essential. In \r\nFinland Sami youth have taken significant steps to \r\nimprove their cultural and political participation \r\nthrough the establishment of the Sami Youth Council. \r\nMeasures to revive indigenous languages, including \r\n“language-nest” activities for children, have proved to \r\nbe an efficient way to strengthen the identity of young \r\nindigenous people.\r\nFinland’s role in the Arctic is defined by our \r\ngeography, and our Arctic expertise by our emphasis \r\non sustainable development and environmental \r\nconsiderations, and by international cooperation. It \r\nis essential to secure the welfare of people living in \r\nthe Arctic. We are convinced that that contributes to \r\neconomic stability and enhances competitiveness. \r\nClimate change has consequences for us all. We must \r\naddress them together.\r\nIndustries such as fishing, herding, hunting and \r\ntourism are vital to Arctic business development and \r\nto the livelihoods of the peoples in the Arctic. Finland \r\nis very pleased with the establishment of the Arctic \r\nEconomic Council, two weeks ago in Iqaluit, Canada. \r\nArctic business leaders and indigenous peoples \r\nare working together to facilitate Arctic business-\r\nto-business activities and responsible economic \r\ndevelopment. Traditional knowledge, stewardship and \r\na focus on small businesses will play a central role in \r\nthat work, which Finland will continue to support going \r\nforward. \r\nThe Nordic countries have a long tradition \r\nof cooperating with the Sami and Greenlandic \r\nrepresentative bodies. Cross-border cooperation \r\nis vital for finding common solutions to common \r\n6/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nchallenges. Internationally, we work together on issues \r\nsuch as biodiversity. Cooperation between different \r\nstakeholders is not without challenges. Only true \r\ndialogue with all the relevant stakeholders will yield \r\nsolid results that are beneficial for all. For that reason, \r\nthe voices of indigenous peoples must be heard also at \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Finland for his statement.\r\nI now give the f loor to The Honourable Henri \r\nDjombo, Minister of the Forest Economy and \r\nSustainable Development of the Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Djombo (Republic of the Congo) (spoke in \r\nFrench): I have the honour of delivering this statement \r\non behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nI would like, at the outset, to express the African \r\nGroup’s congratulations to His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKahamba Kutesa on his election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\nThe African Group is delighted to see that the \r\nmeetings of this important World Conference dedicated \r\nto the promotion and protection of the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples are being led by Uganda, which, \r\nalong with other African countries, has adopted a \r\ncomprehensive and progressive approach to matters \r\nthat concern indigenous peoples. We are also indebted \r\nto the President of the General Assembly at its previous \r\nsession, His Excellency Mr. John Ashe. His persistence \r\nand leadership have ensured that this important meeting \r\nis taking place under the most favourable possible \r\nconditions.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that the process that led to \r\nthis important meeting was a constructive and inclusive \r\none and that it upheld the relevant provisions of \r\nresolution 66/296, of 17 September 2012, which called \r\nin particular for active participation in this Conference.\r\nThe African Group would like at this point to convey \r\nits deep appreciation for the important contribution of \r\nindigenous peoples to the preparatory process for this \r\nWorld Conference. Since indigenous peoples are both \r\nthe subject of the Conference and key players in it, their \r\nactive participation has contributed to draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.1, to be adopted today and which reflects their \r\nvaluable contributions and recommendations. How \r\ncould we not recognize, in the large numbers of us in \r\nthe General Assembly Hall, the very affirmation of our \r\nshared faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity \r\nand value of the human person and in the equality of \r\nthe rights of men and women? Beyond those numbers, \r\nour common will to uphold the commitments contained \r\nin the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples is also illustrated here.\r\nIt is clear that the discussions we have had throughout \r\nthe preparatory process for this conference, and even \r\nbefore, revealed the richness of sympathies surrounding \r\nindigenous issues. In Africa, the indigenous issue that \r\nbrings us together today could be aptly discussed in the \r\nlight of the continent’s history, because the history of \r\nindigenous peoples varies from one region of the world \r\nto another and from one country to another. Today, the \r\ncollective awareness has finally recognized the need to \r\nprovide special protection to those communities, which \r\nhave long been ostracized by discrimination.\r\nFor nearly a decade, African countries have \r\nembraced the cause of indigenous peoples and provided \r\na new assurance of their commitment to that cause. \r\nWe recall that the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295), of \r\n13 September 2007, was adopted with broad support \r\nfrom African countries. That was undoubtedly a \r\nvictory for justice and human dignity, after more than \r\ntwo decades of negotiations between representatives \r\nof Governments and indigenous peoples. The African \r\nGroup views its effective participation in this conference \r\nalong the same lines.\r\nSince then, the situation of indigenous peoples has \r\ngradually improved, and several African countries now \r\nacknowledge the existence of indigenous peoples in \r\ntheir territories as First Peoples groups, but ones who \r\nhave historically been marginalized. Our Governments \r\nare working to ensure their social integration and to \r\npromote and protect their rights as full-f ledged citizens, \r\nable to fully participate in the life of our nations with \r\ndue respect for their culture and language. Protection \r\nand social integration are now a reality.\r\nFollowing a consultative process that identified the \r\nfactors, causes and effects of discrimination suffered \r\nby indigenous peoples of the Congo, the Congolese \r\nGovernment developed a domestic law standard that \r\nreflects the Government’s desire to implement the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples. That is the law for the promotion and protection \r\nof indigenous peoples of 25 February 2011. Now, three \r\nyears after its adoption, the effects of that law, seen as \r\n14-54394 7/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nrevolutionary and exemplary on the African continent, \r\nare noticeable.\r\nIn order to f lesh out the law, in August 2013 the \r\nCongolese Government adopted a new national action \r\nplan to improve the quality of life of indigenous peoples. \r\nTo ensure that they enjoy the dividends associated \r\nwith the use of natural resources, the text provides \r\nfor consultative and participatory approaches to take \r\ninto account the free, prior and informed consent of \r\nthe local indigenous populations with regard to the \r\nuse of those resources. The standing provisions of that \r\ntext guarantee the strict adherence to the sustainable \r\nexercise of rights and cultural activities by indiginous \r\npeoples.\r\nAs we know, the way of life and practices of indigenous \r\npeoples contribute to the care and maintenance of \r\nforest ecosystems and carbon sequestration. Therefore, \r\nmy country calls on the international community and \r\nGovernments to mobilize the necessary means to \r\ninvest in the development of basic infrastructure near \r\nindigenous communities. That approach should include \r\nthe promotion of income-generating activities and \r\npayment for environmental services.\r\nMoreover, in order to give indigenous peoples \r\na way to share their knowledge and their skills, the \r\nRepublic of the Congo initiated and institutionalized \r\nthe International Forum on Indigenous Peoples of \r\nCentral Africa as a platform for integration and \r\ncooperation in the Congo Basin on indigenous issues. \r\nThat institution, which is located in northern Congo in \r\nthe Likouala department, has become an integral part of \r\nthe operational bodies of the Economic Community of \r\nCentral African States. As elsewhere in Africa, through \r\nthe promotion of the rights of indigenous peoples, the \r\nobjective of my country remains the establishment \r\nof the rule of law, free from discrimination based on \r\norigin, ethnicity, way of life or culture.\r\nThe path of equality among the peoples is of course \r\nlaborious and must be maintained by the strong will \r\nof our Governments. African countries are engaging \r\nin that effort and will continue to work with the \r\nUnited Nations system and all initiatives aimed at the \r\ndevelopment of those marginalized peoples. Africa will \r\ncontinue to participate in the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to combat any affront to human conscience \r\nand will spare no effort to contribute to the promotion \r\nand protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. That \r\nis the commitment of our Governments.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia.\r\nPresident Ilves: It is an honour to address \r\nthis high-level meeting dedicated to the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples. As a member of an indigenous \r\npeople — Estonians have lived on our present territory \r\nfor several thousand years — I am especially happy to \r\nsee among participants here so many of those whom \r\nthe World Conference on Indigenous Peoples is about. \r\nTherefore, we can discuss issues faced by indigenous \r\npeople together.\r\nWe have stood on both sides — as an oppressed \r\nindigenous people and now as a Member of the United \r\nNations. We know what indigenous peoples face. \r\nI would like also to f lag at the very outset that it is \r\nunfortunate that the participation of indigenous peoples \r\nin United Nations forums is constantly questioned. It is \r\nincomprehensible, if not to say bizarre and shameful, \r\nthat some States attempt to hinder the participation of \r\nindigenous peoples and offer no explanation for their \r\nactions. We hope that this will soon be a thing of the \r\npast and that indigenous peoples will have a strong \r\nvoice in the international community.\r\nI recall that the indigenous peoples, those most \r\ndirectly affected by the provisions of the outcome \r\ndocument (draft resolution A/69/L.1) we are to adopt \r\ntoday, could not participate in the negotiations on it \r\nin the very last stages. However, I believe that their \r\ninput in the earlier stages provided a good basis for the \r\njoint ownership of the document. I am pleased that in \r\nthe outcome document that we are about to adopt, we \r\ncan reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \r\nIt includes clear deliverables to further improve \r\nindigenous peoples’ rights, including stronger action by \r\nthe United Nations. I hope that the outcome document \r\nwill serve as a basis for the way ahead, and we are \r\nlooking forward to its swift implementation.\r\nThe rights of indigenous peoples must be respected. \r\nThe great majority of States do so, voicing their support \r\nfor the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \r\nEstonia has also voiced such respect. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, in many countries, material gains are often \r\nprioritized over fundamental rights. It is crucial to \r\nunderstand that the cultural heritage of indigenous \r\npeoples is a form of wealth that clearly outweighs \r\n8/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nthe economic profit gained by the extensive and \r\nunsustainable exploitation of natural resources.\r\nThe reckless pursuit of profit at the expense of the \r\ncultures of peoples is precisely what we have witnessed \r\nin many Finno-Ugric areas. For Estonians, the future \r\nof Finno-Ugric peoples, with whom we are linked \r\nin kinship and language, is particularly close to our \r\nhearts. We know and have felt the fear of extinction. \r\nWe have observed with concern that Finno-Ugric \r\npopulations have decreased, while the sociopolitical \r\nactivism needed to improve their position has not \r\nalways corresponded to the major challenges in that \r\narea. The worst-case scenario, in our view, would be \r\nthat national organizations vanish, their leaders be \r\nmarginalized and the countries where they live become \r\nindifferent, claiming that, as such, indigenous peoples \r\nhave no “perspective”, to use a phrase that we know \r\nfrom the Soviet era. \r\nUrbanization, industrialization, world wars, \r\ndeportations and extensive migration have all left \r\ndeep wounds within many indigenous populations, \r\nincluding, for example, the Votic population, our \r\nFinno-Ugric cousins. A few years before the turn of \r\nthe millennium, the construction of the large port of \r\nLaugasuu began. It is being built on traditional Votic \r\nlands, where our cousins have lived for as long as we \r\nEstonians have lived on ours. That construction poses a \r\ngreat danger to the last three remaining Votic villages: \r\nLuutsa, Liivtšülä and Jõgõperä. \r\nThe construction of the port of Laugasuu is in \r\nconflict with the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples, but the current situation \r\nfaced by the Votes is hardly unique. We all know that \r\nthere is a long list of indigenous peoples living in the \r\nmost challenging conditions. For example, side by side \r\nwith the Votes lives another small Finno-Ugric nation, \r\nthe Izhorians, who are especially threatened by the plan \r\nto erect a chemical plant right next to their villages of \r\nRutsi and Viistina. If the chemical plant is erected and \r\nthe environment devastated, the nation and the culture \r\nof the Votes will be endangered and may even be \r\ndestroyed. Mankind will grow ever poorer. \r\nTo support our kindred nations, the Estonian \r\nGovernment launched the Kindred Peoples Programme \r\nin 1999. It is a Government aid programme to support \r\nthe indigenous Uralic languages and cultures. It \r\nprovides support in five different fields — education \r\nand training courses, research, culture and information \r\nexchange, health care and the protection of the \r\nenvironment. For many years, Estonian experts have \r\ncontributed to the Permanent Forum on Indigenous \r\nIssues. Our Government has also provided financial \r\nsupport to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for \r\nIndigenous Populations, and we shall continue to do so \r\nin the future. \r\nI would like to acknowledge New Zealand for \r\nalways including the Maori peoples in their delegation \r\nand meetings. I would like to thank Finland, Norway and \r\nSweden for ensuring the presence of a representative \r\nSaami delegation at all United Nations meetings on \r\nindigenous peoples and for voicing their sincere concern \r\nabout the future of indigenous peoples. I would like to \r\nassociate myself with the statement made earlier by the \r\nPresident of Finland with regard to the inability of the \r\nKola Saami to attend this meeting.\r\nI would like to thank Ukraine for supporting the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples (resolution 61/295) and for recognizing the \r\nCrimean Tatars as an indigenous people. I would like \r\nto thank the many other countries that are taking \r\nsteps to improve the situation of indigenous peoples. \r\nWe are obliged to do everything that we can to \r\nsupport indigenous peoples, to respect their past and \r\nto grant them a future. All indigenous peoples must \r\nbe acknowledged, no matter where they live, be it in \r\nthe Leningrad oblast, Crimea, Amazonas State, New \r\nZealand, Arizona or the Scandinavian peninsula. Let us \r\nlearn to listen to the voices that have been silenced for \r\ntoo long and that too often continue to be so. We cannot \r\nallow the persistence of a colonialist mentality to cover \r\nup crimes committed against indigenous peoples, nor \r\ncan we continue to deny indigenous peoples the right to \r\nhave a say over their own futures. \r\nIn conclusion, the former Estonian President, the \r\nbeloved writer and film-maker Lennart Meri, was one \r\nof those individuals who dared to listen to and to film \r\nsuch peoples. I would like to invite members to the \r\nopening of an exhibition of photographs from his film \r\nand his journeys to the Finno-Ugric indigenous nations \r\nin the Conference Building today at 6 p.m. It is a fitting \r\ntribute to a great film-maker and a man who devoted \r\nhis life to showing how indigenous peoples live and \r\nhow they have suffered.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Estonia for his statement.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the United Mexican States.\r\n14-54394 9/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nPresident Peña Nieto (spoke in Spanish): As \r\nPresident of Mexico and as the representative of a \r\nmulticultural nation, originally founded on the basis \r\nof its indigenous peoples, it is a great honour for me \r\nto participate in this World Conference. I come to this \r\nplenary meeting to affirm the ongoing commitment of \r\nMexico to the protection and recognition of the rights \r\nand freedoms of indigenous peoples in all regions and \r\ncountries of the world. I express my highest appreciation \r\nto the General Assembly for its decision in 2010 to hold \r\nthis historic event, which is the first high-level meeting \r\ndedicated exclusively to the well-being of indigenous \r\npeoples. \r\nFor Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean, the \r\nindigenous issue is at the root of our identities and our \r\nhistorical, social and political circumstances. I mention \r\nthat because of the linguistic diversity and the high \r\nnumber of indigenous peoples in Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, who account for nearly 45 million people. \r\nHowever, I say it, above all, because of the commitment \r\nand leadership that indigenous women and men have \r\nshown over the years to the recognition, protection and \r\npromotion of their rights.\r\nFor Mexico, it has been a great honour to contribute \r\nto the preparation of this World Conference and the \r\nnegotiation of its outcome document (A/69/L.1). The \r\nmajor objective is to achieve the effective exercise of \r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples in all nations. That is a \r\nvery significant achievement and the result of an open, \r\ninclusive and constructive dialogue between Member \r\nStates and indigenous representatives. We have also \r\ntaken care to ensure that their recommendations are in \r\nline with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples. Mexico trusts that the final \r\ndocument will be a road map enabling us to reposition \r\nindigenous issues on the international agenda and \r\nto give renewed impetus to the actions of the United \r\nNations in that area.\r\nThe Mexican delegation appreciates the incorporation \r\nof several of the approaches it presented in favour of the \r\nindigenous of the world, including the following: the \r\npost-2015 development agenda should ensure the rights \r\nof indigenous peoples; the participation of first peoples \r\nin the work of the United Nations should have a status \r\ndistinct from that of non-governmental organizations; \r\nnational laws should be harmonized in the spirit of \r\nthe Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; \r\nand the Human Rights Council, in consultation with \r\nindigenous peoples, should monitor, evaluate and \r\nimprove the implementation of the Declaration in each \r\nMember State. Mexico would like to see those ideas \r\ntranslated into concrete benefits for the estimated 5,000 \r\nindigenous peoples in the world.\r\nWe have to continue working together. Inequality, \r\ninjustice and discrimination against indigenous peoples \r\nare still, unfortunately, a grim reality. To eradicate those \r\npractices and enable indigenous peoples to assert their \r\nrights, we need to strengthen international cooperation \r\nand, above all, intensify actions within each country. \r\nIn Mexico, our Constitution recognizes and guarantees \r\nthe right of indigenous peoples and communities \r\nto self-determination and thus to the autonomy to \r\ndecide their internal forms of coexistence and social, \r\neconomic, political and cultural organization. It also \r\nrecognizes their right to preserve and promote their \r\nculture, traditions and customs in an environment of \r\nequality and non-discrimination.\r\nFor the more than 15 million indigenous people of \r\nMexico to fully exercise those rights, the State relies \r\non a cross-cutting policy, aimed at improving their \r\nquality of life and the creation of greater opportunities \r\nfor development. That policy includes specific actions \r\nto eradicate hunger and overcome extreme poverty in \r\nindigenous municipalities as well as the construction of \r\nbasic infrastructure in their communities. Furthermore, \r\nthe main programme to fight poverty, which serves more \r\nthan 6 million persons of indigenous origin, has been \r\nredesigned and strengthened. We are also determined \r\nto support their integration in public education, health- \r\ncare services and adequate housing. We also encourage \r\ntheir access to justice and their efforts to increase \r\nproduction and marketing of their products and crafts, \r\nwith a focus on sustainability.\r\nIn short, the Government of Mexico supports \r\nindigenous peoples so that they can achieve real, \r\ninclusive development and improve their income and \r\nquality of life, without losing their cultural identity or \r\ncompromising the natural heritage of the country. In that \r\nregard, in accordance with international commitments, \r\nwe have established a respectful and direct dialogue \r\nwith various indigenous communities in order to \r\nguide public policy and infrastructure projects in their \r\nareas of influence. We are thus ensuring effective \r\nparticipation in the design of actions that promote their \r\ncomprehensive development, with full respect for their \r\nself-determination.\r\nThe development initiatives of the United Nations \r\ndeserve the combined skills and experiences of all \r\n10/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\ncountries, because only together can we realize the \r\ngoal of building a better future for all humankind. It \r\nis with abiding conviction that Mexicans continue to \r\nact with global responsibility within this international \r\nOrganization, since it is the forum that best represents \r\nthe diversity of nations and the shared aspiration to \r\npeace, development and prosperity for all the peoples \r\nof the world.\r\nIn Mexico, we are determined to build a true \r\nsociety of rights, in which all people, regardless of their \r\nethnic origin, can exercise in their daily lives the rights \r\nand freedoms guaranteed by our Constitution and \r\ninternational treaties.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the United \r\nMexican States for his statement.\r\nPursuant to sub-paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 66/296, \r\nwe will now hear statements by three representatives of \r\nindigenous peoples.\r\nI now give the f loor to Chief Oren Lyons, Chief of \r\nthe Onondaga Nation Council of Chiefs.\r\nChief Oren Lyons: As we say in Onondagan, “Thank \r\nyou for being well”. And your answer, Mr. President, \r\nis “Yes, what you say is true.” The responsibility for \r\nspeaking on behalf of indigenous people has been given \r\nme again. I shall do the best that I can on their behalf.\r\nI am so glad to see all the people here. It has \r\nbeen a long journey. I greet the Assembly with peace \r\nand friendship, and a question. How do you instruct \r\n7 billion people as to their relationship with the Earth? \r\nUntil they learn that relationship, we are imperilled \r\nas a species. That relationship is fundamental to our \r\nexistence, and we have to understand that Nature is the \r\nauthority and the final word. We are subject to every \r\nnatural force in this world — water, for example, which \r\nis the first law of life.\r\nWe now have 7 billion people, soon to be 8 billion, \r\nsoon to be 9 billion, and soon to be 10 billion. Our \r\nchildren are going to suffer the consequences of \r\ndecisions that are made here today. The responsibility \r\nto future generations has been given to us; it was told to \r\nus many hundreds of years ago. We were set — we were \r\nadvised — by the Great Peacemaker, when He said, \r\n“In your Council for the welfare of the people, \r\nthink not of yourself nor your family nor even your \r\ngeneration. Make your decisions on behalf of seven \r\ngenerations hence”.\r\nThose layers and layers of humankind awaiting \r\ntheir turn on Earth will be determined; their fate will \r\nbe determined by we who sit here today. I think that \r\nthe current generation is the generation that is going to \r\nmake the decision as to whether or not we survive as a \r\nspecies.\r\nToday I bring participants greetings from \r\nindigenous people around the world. Let me repeat: we \r\nare the keepers of traditions, ceremonies, histories and \r\nthe future of nations, and we are the ones who escaped \r\nyour proselytization. We survived with the wisdom of \r\nthe old ones. We are pleased to add our voices to others \r\nin the Assembly in this great effort for common sense \r\nand peace among nations.\r\nI bring a most urgent message that was brought to \r\nour annual gathering of the Traditional Circle of Elders \r\nand Youth. This message was brought by a runner from \r\nthe North, a traditional person from Greenland. He said: \r\n“The ice is melting”. He informed us that years ago  they \r\nhad noticed trickles of water coming down the sheer \r\nface of Glacier Mountain, and that trickle has grown to \r\na roaring river of ice water pouring out of the mountain \r\ninto the Atlantic Ocean. Thousands of feet of ice have \r\nbeen lost, and it continues to melt at an accelerating \r\npace. I remind the Assembly that the acceleration is \r\nwhat we are dealing with. The compounding effect is \r\nthat we are now fully engaged.\r\nIn the Assembly, as leaders of the world, as a \r\ncollective voice, we join this mission of peace. We \r\nadd our presence in support of this great effort for \r\nreconciliation between peoples and nations. We agree \r\nthat there must be parity and equity between rich and \r\npoor nations, between white people and people of \r\ncolour, and rich people and poor people, with special \r\nattention to women, children and indigenous peoples. \r\nWe, in our collective voices, add that there must be a \r\nreconciliation between peoples and the natural world, \r\nbetween nation States and the forests that sustain us, \r\nbetween corporations and the resources that they mine, \r\nthe fish that they catch and the water that they use.\r\nIndigenous nations and peoples believe in the \r\nspiritual powers of the universe. We believe in the \r\nultimate power and authority and limitless energy \r\nbeyond our comprehension. We believe in the order \r\nof the universe. We believe in the laws of creation and \r\nthat all life is bound by these natural laws. We call this \r\nessence the spirit of life. This is what gives the world \r\nthe energy to create and procreate and becomes the \r\n14-54394 11/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nponderous and powerful law of regeneration — the law \r\nof the seed.\r\nWe, in our collective voices, speak to this to \r\nremind everyone that spirit and spiritual laws transcend \r\ngenerations. We know, because this has sustained \r\nus. Religion and spirituality are vital to survival and \r\nmoral law. It is a faith that has sustained our human \r\nspirit through our darkest hours. It has sustained our \r\nhuman spirit in times of crisis during the times we \r\nsuffered through the grinding measures of inexorable \r\npersecutions that have spanned generations and \r\ncontinue today. Yet here we are today, adding our voices \r\nto this plea for sanity in leadership and responsibility to \r\nthe future generations whose faces are looking up from \r\nthe Earth, each awaiting their time of life here.\r\nThe collective voices of indigenous people add that \r\nwe are saddened by the absence of many of our brothers, \r\nnot allowed to be in the Assembly today. However, we \r\nbelieve that reconciliation should begin at the United \r\nNations because peace is an inclusive term. We include \r\neveryone, and peace and reconciliation is the purpose \r\nof this summit. Peace is dynamic and requires great \r\neffort of spirit and mind to attain unity. Leaders of \r\npeace must step forward and take responsibility for a \r\nparadigm change in the direction of current lifestyles \r\nand materialistic societies. The human species has \r\nbecome the most voracious and abusive consumer of \r\nEarth’s resources. We have tipped the balance against \r\nour children and their future and we imperil all life.\r\nDespite all of our declarations and all of our \r\nproclamations, no matter how profound they may be, \r\nthe ice is melting in the North. We see the accelerations \r\nof the winds. We see the fires that are raging around the \r\nworld, insects moving northward, the Lyme tick. We \r\nare dealing with all this. And we see that the sun’s rays \r\nthat provide us with light, energy and the very essence \r\nof life are now causing sickness among our people, \r\nblinding animals and killing the plankton of the sea. \r\nThis is only the beginning and we are helpless already. \r\nWe will now see the real power, the spiritual power of \r\nthe Earth.\r\nThere can be no peace as long as we wage war upon \r\nour mother, the Earth. Responsible and courageous \r\nactions must be taken to realign ourselves with the great \r\nlaws of nature. We must meet this crisis now, while we \r\nstill have time. We offer these words as common peoples \r\nin support of peace, equity, justice and reconciliation. \r\nAs we speak, the ice continues to melt in the North.\r\nThere is an addendum to this. I gave this speech \r\n14 years ago in this very Hall. So, what have we \r\nlearned? This effort for me to speak on behalf of the \r\nindigenous people, I thought, well, what will I write \r\nnow? I said, I do not need to write. I just need to repeat \r\nwhat we said to the Assembly 14 years ago — precious \r\nyears that we have lost. So I urge the Assembly, I urge \r\nMember States, to listen to our voice. We are the pulse \r\nof Mother Earth. We have experience and we have a \r\nlot of knowledge, so keep our languages. The United \r\nNations might have to call on us again.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Ms. Aili \r\nKeshkitalo, President of the Sami Parliament of Norway.\r\nMs. Keshkitalo: It is indeed a great honour for me, \r\nas the President of the Sami Parliament of Norway, to \r\naddress the General Assembly on this historic occasion \r\ntoday, the opening of the World Conference on \r\nIndigenous Peoples. It has been a long journey for all of \r\nus: from December 2010, when the General Assembly \r\ndecided that the World Conference should be held, until \r\ntoday’s actual opening of the World Conference. The \r\narduous journey within the United Nations to promote \r\nand advance indigenous peoples’ rights has been \r\nan inspirational one, and yet one that is grounded in \r\npragmatism.\r\nI sincerely thank all concerned who were involved \r\nin the process, particularly indigenous peoples in the \r\nseven indigenous regions, including the Indigenous \r\nGlobal Coordinating Group and Member States, for their \r\ntireless efforts, their wisdom and their collaborative \r\nspirit. We have had challenges in the process, including \r\nwith regard to indigenous peoples’ participation, due \r\nto reasons related to the rules of procedure and other \r\nmatters.\r\nToday, my thoughts also go to those indigenous \r\nrepresentatives who played an instrumental role in \r\nthe process but have since passed away. They were \r\nour siblings, our teachers, our parents and our friends. \r\nTheir contributions lie deep in our hearts, and we pay \r\nrespect to their memories. I am sure that their spirits \r\nare with us during these momentous days.\r\nIndigenous peoples have been marginalized, \r\ndiscriminated against and ignored; but we have not lost \r\nheart, struggling for many decades until September \r\n2007, when the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples was finally adopted \r\nby this apex world body. It was a historic milestone \r\nand a triumph for justice and human dignity. The \r\n12/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nchallenge now remains to implement the provisions \r\nof the Declaration by closing the gap between theory \r\nand practice, between inspiration and reality, between \r\ncommitment and implementation and between politics \r\nand good faith and sincerity.\r\nEvery single indigenous regional and thematic \r\ncaucus has contributed to that process, drawing upon \r\ntheir respective struggles to halt the ongoing usurpation \r\nof our lands, territories and resources; eliminate \r\ndiscriminatory practices sometimes aimed at destroying \r\nour cultures; craft solutions to halt climate change in \r\norder to prevent the imposition of development models \r\nthat destroy the life-giving capacities and integrity of \r\nMother Earth; and maintain our identities, cultures and \r\ndignity and our social and political integrity.\r\nOne gathering in a small city in the traditional \r\nSami territory within Norway became the epicentre \r\nof the indigenous peoples preparatory process — the \r\nGlobal Indigenous Preparatory Meeting, held in Alta in \r\nJune 2013. It was a gathering attended by approximately \r\n600 indigenous representatives from around the world, \r\nas well as some Governments — a gathering that my \r\nParliament was honoured to host. The Alta conference \r\nwas momentous. It was the culmination, the end result, \r\nof a process that started at local and national levels, then \r\nwent regional and finally global. Indigenous peoples \r\nfrom around the world mobilized resources and support \r\nand unanimously agreed on their common priorities.\r\nThe city of Alta is significant. It is where many \r\nof the leaders of the Sami Kautokeino Rebellion of \r\n1852 were sentenced to death and executed. It is also \r\nthe birthplace of Norway’s modern indigenous policy. \r\nThe dispute about the hydroelectric development of the \r\nAlta-Kautokeino watercourse in the 1980s highlighted \r\nthe need to clarify the State’s relationship to Sami \r\npeople, including our legal position. That was the start \r\nof a process that led to the State’s recognition of the \r\nSami as an indigenous people and the establishment of \r\nthe Sami Parliament.\r\nIndigenous peoples have been fighting for a \r\nvery long time to be recognized as “peoples” under \r\ninternational law. As we know, article 3 of the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples (resolution 61/295) mirrors common article 1 of \r\nthe two international human rights covenants of 1966. \r\nThe right to self-determination is a fundamental right \r\nof all peoples, which includes the right of peoples to \r\ndecide for themselves how they wish to engage with \r\nother peoples and with the international community. \r\nThe Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples \r\nrecognizes that indigenous peoples are free and equal \r\nto all other peoples and that they have the right to be \r\nfree from any kind of discrimination. We are not there \r\nyet, but we are slowly moving in the right direction.\r\nI welcome the fact that the outcome document of the \r\nWorld Conference recognizes the urgent need to ensure \r\nthat indigenous peoples’ representatives and their \r\nrepresentative institutions are able to participate at the \r\nUnited Nations on issues affecting them. Indigenous \r\npeoples are ready to engage in discussions about how \r\nthat can be achieved, and we look forward to studying \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on this matter during the \r\nseventieth session of the General Assembly.\r\nI believe that the process leading up to the World \r\nConference has demonstrated that indigenous peoples \r\nmake important contributions to the work of the United \r\nNations. We are reliable partners that engage in the \r\nwork of the United Nations, and we do so in good faith \r\nand expect the same in return from States and the \r\nUnited Nations. Make no mistake; indigenous peoples \r\nare here to help strengthen societies, by advancing our \r\ncollective rights and the rights of our elders, women, \r\nyouth, children and disabled. When humankind \r\nharnesses the potential of indigenous peoples, we will \r\nall be more harmonious, more successful and more just.\r\nIf there is anything all of us in this great Hall \r\nshould learn from the past three years, it is that the \r\nrelationship among indigenous peoples, Member States \r\nand the United Nations can be mutually respectful \r\nand beneficial when carried out in good faith and in \r\nthe spirit of cooperation. Indigenous peoples have \r\nsuffered — and still do — from historic injustice as \r\nthe result of discrimination, colonization, invalid legal \r\ndoctrines and dispossession of our lands, territories \r\nand resources, all of which has prevented us from fully \r\nexercising our rights, including our right to development \r\nin accordance with our own needs and aspirations. That \r\nis why we work so hard to advocate for our rights.\r\nA Sami proverb says that “The night is not so long \r\nthat the day never comes”, which essentially means \r\nthat all bad things will eventually come to an end. \r\nThe adoption of the outcome document of the World \r\nConference is a small but important step towards the \r\ndawn of the day of indigenous peoples. What we have \r\nnot achieved in this process, we will pursue in the \r\n14-54394 13/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nfuture, at the national and international levels, with \r\ngreat determination in the spirit of cooperation.\r\nWe are committed to continuing to build a just and \r\nsustainable future for our coming generations. We shall \r\nadvocate for what matters in the lives of our peoples, \r\nincluding by increasing our efforts to start a new \r\nchapter of international cooperation that recognizes \r\nand advances our rights, while fully respecting the \r\nrights of others. This is the time when we — States, \r\nindigenous peoples and other sectors of society — have \r\nno other, wiser choice but to continue to work together. \r\nThis is the time when we must persist in realizing our \r\ncommon aspirations for human rights, justice, dignity, \r\nintegrity, cultural identity and a better future for the \r\nentire world community.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Mr. Luis \r\nEvelis, Member of the Senate of Colombia.\r\nMr. Evelis (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I wish \r\nto convey a very fraternal greeting to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Secretary-General, Heads \r\nof State and Government, the various delegations and \r\nthe indigenous peoples and their representatives at this \r\nConference.\r\nI also welcome the efforts of the United Nations \r\nto ensure a participatory process for all the peoples \r\nand bodies that were invited to build a document that \r\nwould establish a plan of action designed to ensure the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295). \r\nI also wish to highlight the work done by the Global \r\nCoordinating Group, particularly the important role \r\nplayed in that process by Ms. Mirna Cunningham and \r\nMr. Les Malezer.\r\nI thank the members of the Andean Coordinator of \r\nIndigenous Organizations for giving me the honour of \r\nparticipating in this Conference. I would also point out \r\nthat the outcome document of this summit (resolution \r\n69/2) is the result of an ongoing struggle of organizations \r\nand indigenous peoples and of their considerable ability \r\nto debate and come together. I therefore urge that we \r\npursue this dialogue not only at the national level, but \r\nalso at the international level and in the United Nations \r\nframework.\r\nI recognize the progress made by and the willingness \r\nof certain States and Governments to incorporate into \r\ntheir national legislation all international instruments, \r\nincluding the United Nations Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples. I also urge that all agreements \r\nreached and the outcome document be incorporated \r\ninto and implemented through public programmes \r\nand policies and explicit budgets to ensure that the \r\nindigenous peoples of Latin America and the world can \r\nenjoy their rights.\r\nI would also like to state that while it may be true \r\nthat there has been important progress made in the \r\nUnited Nations, it is necessary to make the aspirations \r\nof indigenous peoples much more concrete and to adopt \r\ntheir paradigms for coexistence, peace, development \r\nand well-being. It must also be said that there are \r\ngreat lacunae that are cause for much concern. As \r\ncertain United Nations agencies and other international \r\norganizations have noted, indigenous peoples continue \r\nto be the poorest of the poor, despite so much legislation \r\nand some very advanced constitutions in certain parts \r\nof the world.\r\nIndigenous peoples suffer the greatest effects of \r\nclimate change. They are also victims of and suffer \r\nfrom all the consequences of a development model that \r\nleads to illiteracy, poverty and hunger. In many parts of \r\nthe world, above all in our region, indigenous peoples \r\nhave the most limited access to quality health care and \r\neducation. In some countries, indigenous peoples are \r\nthreatened with physical and cultural extermination. \r\nWe have also seen some States implement reforms to \r\nlower international standards with respect to indigenous \r\nrights, particularly regarding prior notice, self-\r\ndetermination and free, prior and informed consent. \r\nWe note that some sectors within indigenous \r\ngroups are more vulnerable, including women, young \r\npeople and children. We are also seeing an increased \r\nexodus of indigenous peoples to major cities, owing to \r\na lack of opportunity in many countries. Against that \r\nbackground and recognizing the feelings of the Indian \r\npopulations in some countries of the world, I want to \r\nsuggest the following recommendations on behalf of \r\nthe indigenous peoples of Latin America.\r\nStates should, after the outcome document \r\ncontained in draft resolution A/69/L.1 has been \r\nadopted and on the basis of the Declaration and the \r\ninternational instruments on the subject, proceed to \r\nincorporate all the relevant instruments and adopt them \r\nin their national legislatures. That should lead to public \r\npolicy initiatives that are inclusive as well as capable \r\nof distinguishing and attempting to resolve the gaps \r\n14/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nthat have been referred to by speakers and in the very \r\nvaluable outcome document that we will approve today.\r\nMrs. Perceval (Argentina), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIn addition, States in the United Nations system and \r\nthe international community must listen to indigenous \r\npeoples and pay attention to their paradigms for \r\ndevelopment, because those peoples are well rooted \r\nin their relationship with Mother Earth and know that \r\nnature itself has rights. If we do not understand that, \r\nI would be pessimistic as to the future well-being not \r\njust of indigenous peoples, but also of all of humanity. \r\nWe also recommend that we design different policies \r\nto deal with all of the difficulties of exclusion that \r\nthe women, young people and children of indigenous \r\ncommunities suffer in all parts of the world. We need \r\nto make progress in terms of self-determination; \r\nfree, prior and informed consent is necessary for any \r\nproposed action. It is important that we not just look \r\nfor economic growth indicators in those States, but that \r\ngrowth also be reflected in living well, as the major \r\nindicator of overcoming poverty and of the well-being \r\nof indigenous peoples.\r\nI would also like to recommend that the United \r\nNations system continue to play an important role in \r\nbuilding consensus when it comes to defining strategies, \r\nbringing together the international community, the \r\nprivate sector and multilateral sectors to address all \r\nsituations of exclusion suffered by indigenous peoples. \r\nIndigenous peoples within their organizations must \r\nthemselves be encouraged to continue to fight and \r\nwork to put forward proposals, because the future of \r\nhumanity is not just the future of the powerful and of \r\nGovernments; it is also a future that is in our hands. \r\nTogether we have to save the planet. We all have the \r\nopportunity to achieve that; there is room for everyone.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 66/296, I \r\nnow give the f loor to Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nMr. Al Hussein: It is a great honour for me to join \r\nthe General Assembly today at the World Conference \r\non Indigenous Peoples. I see this as both a celebration \r\nand a call for action. We are here to celebrate the \r\ncontributions that indigenous peoples make to our \r\nsocieties, as well as the progress that we have achieved \r\ntowards the full recognition and respect for their rights, \r\nincluding through the implementation of the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples (resolution 61/295). But we are also here so \r\nthat States can commit to stronger action to close the \r\ngaps in implementation, gaps that continue to diminish \r\nthe impact of the Declaration and other human rights \r\nstandards and so that we can take action to strengthen \r\nour fight against the discrimination, exclusion and land \r\ngrabs that indigenous peoples still experience in all \r\nregions of the world. That action must demonstrate that \r\nour resolve to advance the rights of indigenous peoples \r\nis not simply rhetorical, but real.\r\nA proverb of the Native American Hopi tribe \r\nstates, “One finger cannot lift a pebble”. It reminds \r\nus that alone, we can achieve very little — perhaps \r\nhardly anything of significance. So I am heartened \r\nby the strong and high-level engagement of numerous \r\nStates and other parties in the preparations for this \r\nConference and, in particular, by the very impressive \r\ncommitment on the part of so many indigenous peoples. \r\nTheir in-depth contributions, especially to the outcome \r\ndocument (A/67/994, annex) of the Global Indigenous \r\nPreparatory Conference in Alta, have been crucial. I \r\nvery much hope that in the future the United Nations \r\nwill open its doors even wider to accommodate the full \r\nparticipation of indigenous peoples.\r\nMany representatives in the Hall today have \r\ntravelled from remote corners of the world. Some of the \r\nbeneficiaries of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for \r\nIndigenous Peoples have travelled for up to seven days, \r\ntaking several boats and f lights to attend this event, \r\nin order to highlight the challenges their communities \r\nface, for many challenges remain. Seven years after \r\nthe adoption of the Declaration, specific disaggregated \r\ndata on indigenous peoples are lacking. But the harsh \r\nimprint of poverty and marginalization suffered by \r\nindigenous peoples is clearly visible in all the available \r\nstatistics.\r\nIn developed countries, the percentage of \r\nindigenous people in prison is highly disproportionate \r\nto their numbers. In one country, indigenous children \r\nwere 25 times more likely to be in detention than \r\nother children. In Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\nindigenous children are three times more likely than \r\nothers to have no access to education, safe drinking \r\nwater or housing. In Africa and Asia, indigenous \r\nyoung adults are more likely to be deprived of their \r\nright to education, especially if they are female. In the \r\nArctic, the Pacific and South-East Asia, indigenous \r\nwomen are at greater risk of dying during pregnancy \r\n14-54394 15/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nor childbirth than women from other communities, and \r\ntheir newborns and young children are also more likely \r\nto die. Such stark statistics translate into thousands of \r\nhuman tragedies — thousands of violations of human \r\nrights.\r\nThis World Conference and its outcome document \r\nconstitute the stepping stones that will bring our work \r\non indigenous peoples’ rights to a new level. And as we \r\ndo so, we must also recall the past. Recently, I learned \r\nabout a story that I found very moving. For centuries, \r\nan enormous rock that resembled a large, pale bison \r\nstood by the South Saskatchewan River in Canada. It \r\nwas a sacred gathering place for indigenous peoples on \r\nthe vast plains. But in 1966, in order to accommodate \r\nthe construction of a dam and an artificial lake, that \r\nmonumental rock was blown apart with dynamite. The \r\nwaters rose and the jagged, broken pieces were covered \r\nin darkness. But last month, after a patient search, those \r\npieces were found, deep under the waters. Once again, \r\nas their ancestors had done for generations, indigenous \r\npeoples could touch the remains of the rock and feel \r\nthrough it their connection to their past.\r\nThe rock could not be reconstituted; its pieces will \r\nremain under water. But the discovery will bring the \r\nrock’s story to life. Generations to come will know \r\nwhere it is and what it has meant and continues to mean \r\nto their community. Through this story, I understand \r\nthat what has been done is done. Often it has been \r\nbitterly unjust. But the indigenous peoples of the world \r\nhave shown us their strength, persistence and depth of \r\nwisdom. They possess clarity and knowledge. Standing \r\nhere together we can look forward and build societies \r\nbased on partnership, mutual respect and human rights.\r\nAt this World Conference, I urge Member States \r\nto once again pledge to ensure that the human rights \r\nand dignity of all indigenous peoples are acknowledged \r\nand fully protected, in line with the Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples. I am confident that the \r\ndraft outcome document of this Conference will be \r\nadopted and will provide strong human rights tools to \r\npromote the full application of the Declaration.\r\nThe constant and vigorous engagement of human \r\nrights mechanisms is vitally important. We must \r\nalso make sure that indigenous peoples’ rights are \r\nfully embedded in all other international initiatives \r\nthat affect them. The new post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals must be explicitly rooted in those \r\nrights, so that indigenous rights, lands and cultures can \r\nno longer be sacrificed in the name of skewed concepts \r\nof development. Indigenous peoples’ concerns and \r\nrecommendations will also be vital for tomorrow’s \r\nClimate Summit and for the 2015 World Conference \r\non Disaster Risk Reduction. Natural disasters and \r\nthe effects of climate change are often borne by \r\nindigenous peoples — and those peoples may also hold \r\nthe traditional knowledge that can help mitigate these \r\ndisasters.\r\nBut, ultimately, the meaning and value of all the \r\ninternational processes can be measured only in terms \r\nof their real impact. The commitments that we make \r\nhere and at other conferences must be followed up \r\ndecisively at the national and local levels with resources \r\nand political will that match the ambitions expressed in \r\nspeeches. It is easy to be brave from a distance, as the \r\nproverb says. We need real impact.\r\nI look forward to seeing national action plans and \r\nstrategies in line with the objectives of the Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, plans and strategies \r\nthat include all of the Declaration’s principles: self-\r\ndetermination; free, prior and informed consent; the \r\nrights of indigenous women; respect for treaty rights; \r\nthe rights of indigenous persons with disabilities; and \r\nmany more.\r\nI call on States to develop such plans in full \r\ncooperation with indigenous peoples. There must be \r\nan immediate halt to the intimidation, persecution, \r\nviolence and sometimes death that advocates for \r\nindigenous peoples continue to face in some countries \r\nwhen they take up the legitimate defence of their \r\ncommunities’ rights and lands. All those who seek to \r\ncooperate with the United Nations in the field of human \r\nrights must be free to do so. I am also very concerned \r\nabout reports that some indigenous representatives have \r\nbeen prevented from taking part in this conference. \r\nMy Office, including its field presences, stands ready, \r\ntogether with our United Nations partners, to support the \r\nefforts of the international community and indigenous \r\npeoples, building on the work that we are already \r\nundertaking in close cooperation with Governments \r\nand indigenous peoples in all regions.\r\nThis World Conference has the potential to be a \r\nmilestone in our quest to ensure full respect for the \r\nrights of indigenous peoples. I encourage all present to \r\nset out clear goals and renewed commitment, so that \r\nthat quest can move forward.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with paragraph 3 (b) of resolution 66/296, I \r\n16/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nnow give the f loor to Ms. Dalee Sambo Dorough, Chair \r\nof the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous \r\nIssues.\r\nMs. Dorough (United Nations Permanent Forum \r\non Indigenous Issues): First, I want to acknowledge \r\nthe Onondaga Nation, original inhabitants of this land, \r\nand thank them for the welcome on their territory \r\nonce again. I would also like to echo the comments of \r\nconcern made by the Presidents of Finland and Estonia \r\nand, just now, by the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, concerning any and all actions to disallow \r\nindigenous peoples’ participation in this gathering \r\ntoday. Hopefully, such actions will not continue in the \r\nfuture.\r\nOn behalf of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous \r\nIssues, I, too, want to welcome each of the participants \r\nto the United Nations and this significant two-day \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting — a meeting that should be \r\nconsidered important for all indigenous peoples across \r\nthe globe. Since the General Assembly’s adoption of \r\nresolution 66/296 and the initial discussions by the \r\nGovernment of Bolivia, the Forum has concerned \r\nitself with the full, effective and equal participation \r\nof indigenous peoples in the preparatory processes for \r\nthis event. Many will agree that the preparations for \r\nthis gathering had a very slow start, causing indigenous \r\npeoples, including those who serve voluntarily as expert \r\nmembers of the Forum, to become deeply concerned at \r\nthe uncertainty that was generated by lack of concrete \r\nUnited Nations action.\r\nHowever, since 2011, the Forum’s expert members \r\nhave generously provided space in the Forum’s agenda \r\nin order to build a spirit of partnership, inclusiveness \r\nand respect between Member States, indigenous peoples \r\nand United Nations agencies, funds and programmes. I \r\nbelieve that without the generosity of the Forum this \r\nprocess would not have taken the form or momentum that \r\nhas collectively propelled us to this opening ceremony \r\nand our substantive programme for the afternoon and \r\ntomorrow. I genuinely hope this spirit of partnership \r\ncontinues at the regional and national levels, and, more \r\nimportantly, at the indigenous community level.\r\nIndigenous peoples have spent the past few decades \r\nbuilding genuine cooperation with States in good faith, \r\nconsistent with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Moreover, the United \r\nNations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples is a strong testament to what can be achieved \r\nwhen States and indigenous peoples strive together \r\nto uphold the Charter’s purposes and principles and \r\nthereby strengthen the international human rights \r\nsystem as a whole.\r\nAt this moment, it is highly important for all of us \r\nnot just to underscore the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, but also to be mindful of \r\nthe pertinent international legal obligations of Member \r\nStates in relation to all peoples, including indigenous \r\npeoples. Specifically, I would like to emphasize the \r\nperemptory norms of international law and in particular \r\nthe principle of and right to self-determination, as \r\naffirmed in the Charter, the International Covenants, \r\nthe 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law \r\nconcerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among \r\nStates in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations (resolution 2625 (XXV)) and, of course, the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples (resolution 61/295, annex).\r\nFurthermore, I must stress that even though the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as a \r\nwhole, is not an expression of customary international \r\nlaw,\r\n“some of its key provisions can reasonably be \r\nregarded as corresponding to established principles \r\nof general international law, therefore implying the \r\nexistence of equivalent and parallel international \r\nobligations to [sic] which States are bound to \r\ncomply with ...\r\n“The relevant areas of indigenous peoples’ \r\nrights with respect to which the discourse on \r\ncustomary international law arises are self-\r\ndetermination, [the right to self-determination of \r\nindigenous peoples] autonomy or self-government, \r\ncultural rights and identity, land rights as well as \r\nreparation, redress and remedies.”\r\nIn addition to the objectives of the hastily negotiated \r\noutcome document, contained in draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.1, with the limited and carefully controlled \r\nparticipation of indigenous peoples from around the \r\nglobe, the peremptory norms of international law and \r\ncustomary international law principles remain essential \r\nand constant parameters for all future dialogue, \r\nnegotiation and implementation of the individual \r\nand collective human rights of indigenous peoples. \r\nFurthermore, the articulation of the right to free, prior \r\nand informed consent, and the continuing importance \r\nof indigenous peoples’ rights to their lands, territories \r\nand resources, remain urgent and necessary features for \r\n14-54394 17/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nthe survival, sustainability and vitality of indigenous \r\npeoples, nations and communities.\r\nFor all future dialogue, at the local, national and \r\nespecially international level, we must recognize that \r\nconsensus loses its validity if it is used to undermine \r\nthe principles of justice, democracy, respect for human \r\nrights, equality and non-discrimination, as well as \r\ngood faith. Good governance becomes a casualty if \r\na few States, or even one State, can undermine such \r\nessential rights and principles at the international level. \r\nWe must recognize that indigenous peoples are among \r\nthe most vulnerable and disadvantaged in the world. \r\nIt is therefore a huge injustice if they are severely \r\nundermined by a highly questionable practice that \r\nallows the lowest common denominator to prevail.\r\nIn 1993, former Secretary-General Boutros \r\nBoutros-Ghali underlined that “human rights constitute \r\nthe common language of humanity”. The human \r\nrights of indigenous peoples must not be politicized \r\nor otherwise undermined by local, regional and \r\nnational State interests and agendas. They must rather \r\nbe respected and recognized by local, regional and \r\nnational Governments. These principles and human \r\nrights are universal. They do not stop at the borders \r\nbetween so-called developed and developing States. \r\nAll States must consult and cooperate with indigenous \r\npeoples, consistent with their right to free, prior and \r\ninformed consent, as well as related State international \r\nobligations, including those pertaining to human \r\nrights, the environment and sustainable and equitable \r\ndevelopment. This high-level plenary meeting should \r\nbe remembered for its contribution through a principled \r\noutcome document — a document that must be \r\ninterpreted against the backdrop of international law, \r\ncustomary international law principles and in particular \r\nthe human rights affirmed in the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\r\nIn conclusion, I call on Member States, guided by \r\na spirit of solidarity and partnership with indigenous \r\npeoples and consistent with their international legal \r\nobligations, as well as their political capacity, to provide \r\nsupport for effective implementation of the outcome \r\ndocument and its mutually agreed terms for cooperation \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Finally, let us \r\nensure that we are guided not only by legal imperatives \r\nand international legal obligations but also by moral \r\nimperatives.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the opening session of the high-\r\nlevel meeting. I should now like to consult members \r\nwith a view to giving the f loor to the indigenous leader \r\nand Nobel laureate Ms. Rigoberta Menchú. If there \r\nis no objection, may I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and without setting a precedent, to \r\ninvite Ms. Menchú to make a statement at this meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with the decision just taken, I now give the \r\nf loor to Ms. Menchú.\r\nMs. Menchú (spoke in Spanish): Today is a sacred \r\nday in the Mayan calendar, celebrating the seven energies \r\nof Ahau Ahpu. Ahpu is the strength of the human \r\nbeing, of every man and woman living on our planet. \r\nAhpu reminds us that we are also children of oxygen \r\nand Mother Earth, and with that observation I begin my \r\ncontribution to the General Assembly at its first high-\r\nlevel meeting on indigenous peoples. I would like to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for enabling the Assembly \r\nto host this meeting, and I hope it will culminate in the \r\nadoption of a draft resolution (A/69/L.1) that promotes \r\nthe rights and dignity of indigenous peoples.\r\nFirst, it was in 1923 that our brother Deskaheh \r\ntravelled to the League of Nations to ask to be able to \r\nparticipate fully and actively within the organization. \r\nHe did not succeed, but he set a precedent. \r\nMany years ago, when I was 23, I had the good \r\nfortune to participate in the inaugural meeting of the \r\nWorking Group on Indigenous Populations, at which \r\nindigenous peoples began a strong petition within \r\nthe United Nations. We are grateful to that Working \r\nGroup, to which we pay tribute today, for having moved \r\nforward the debate on the rights of indigenous peoples. \r\nSince 1982, when the Working Group began its work, \r\nthe United Nations has seen hundreds of thousands of \r\ndelegations of men and women. As a result, we saw the \r\nestablishment of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous \r\nIssues, which led to the adoption of the Indigenous \r\nand Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169), by \r\nthe International Labour Organization. That gave \r\nrise to the participation of indigenous peoples at the \r\nWorld Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna \r\nin 1993, where a programme of action that provided \r\nfor the establishment of the first International Decade \r\nof Indigenous Peoples. I recall all the aforementioned \r\nevents because we, as indigenous peoples, remember \r\n18/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\neverything that we have been through, and the history \r\nof the world is reflected in our intensive efforts and the \r\nmany United Nations resolutions.\r\nToday, we are once again witnessing extraordinary \r\nprogress, not only in the rights of indigenous peoples \r\nbut also in the common language to define those rights. \r\nThat is why we fully support the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution at this World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples (A/69/L.1), which will once again strengthen \r\nnot only our struggles but also, above all, the action \r\nplans for, on the one hand, indigenous peoples and, on \r\nthe other, for nations or nation States. We would like to \r\nsay that the progress made with regard to indigenous \r\npeoples has made it possible for many millions of \r\nindigenous peoples to reaffirm their identity, their \r\nrights and their existence.\r\nToday, however, I speak on behalf of the young \r\npeople, the children and those thousands of millions \r\nof our brothers who still suffer from hunger, poverty \r\nand malnutrition and the effects of the daily violence \r\nthat they experience in their communities, villages and \r\nlands in order to protect their seas, rivers, waters and \r\nland. I am here because I believe that indigenous peoples \r\nand their young people and children have the right to a \r\nfuture. That is why we need once again to agree on the \r\noutcome document that we hope the General Assembly \r\nwill adopt in a few minutes.\r\nFor us, peace means freedom, mutual respect, \r\ncommon interest and consultation. For us, peace is \r\nlistening to the various views, because we are part of \r\none diversity. As has already been noted, it is a great \r\nresponsibility to speak on behalf of the indigenous \r\npeoples today. That is why I also appeal to all \r\nindigenous peoples and their leaders to ensure that they \r\nact with full responsibility and that, above all, we set as \r\na priority the fundamental interests of our communities \r\nand our peoples.\r\nWe therefore have gathered today to celebrate \r\nsuch progress. We can see the future. We have success \r\nstories. That is why there is the Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples, which has also been \r\ndiscussed for several decades. I would like to pay \r\ntribute to the hundreds of thousands of indigenous men \r\nand women who have lost their lives since the debate on \r\ntheir rights began in the United Nations in August 1982. \r\nSince that time, indigenous communities have suffered \r\nthe most serious human rights violations, including \r\ngenocide, ethnic crimes, fratricide and gender-based \r\ncrimes. Those concepts are still not included in the \r\ndraft resolution. However, we must set a precedent so \r\nthat in the Assembly we can strengthen the observance \r\nand monitoring of international mechanisms, above all, \r\nthose that, together with members and the peoples of \r\nthe world, we have established and adopted.\r\nUncertainty still prevails among our peoples \r\nin the area of health, because health is essential for \r\nall humankind. However, for indigenous peoples \r\nin particular, health means their overall well-being \r\nand does not relate only to pain and suffering in \r\none part of the body. We must include the existing \r\ntechnologies of indigenous peoples in comprehensive \r\ndevelopment plans. It is essential to incorporate the \r\nscience and knowledge of indigenous peoples in the \r\narea of education. Today, we need to adopt a new \r\napproach to education in a multicultural context, not \r\nmerely an education that reproduces the paradigms \r\nof colonialism or subjugation. We need to combat \r\nracism and discrimination head on, because racism and \r\ndiscrimination are emotional habits and mental ills that \r\nundermine the integrity of the human being. We must \r\nalso strengthen our legitimate, full, active and focused \r\nparticipation in programmes of work that are relevant \r\nto us, both within the bodies of the United Nations and \r\nin public policies at the national level.\r\nWe congratulate our brothers and sisters who \r\nfirst courageously came to speak to the international \r\ncommunity. They denounced crimes against humanity. \r\nThey made it clear that humankind breathes the oxygen \r\nof our Mother Earth. Without them, our overall well-\r\nbeing would have been completely undermined.\r\nDuring the 34 years that I have had the good fortune \r\nto be connected with the United Nations, I have seen \r\nnot only developments but also frustration, since the \r\ngreatest problems can be found among the millions of \r\nindigenous people living in mountainous areas and in \r\ncommunities that are still not connected by roads. They \r\nstill have access only to a small amount of information, \r\nnot the technology that humankind talks about today.\r\nWe peoples, like all peoples who have suffered \r\nfrom slavery and subjection, are like all men and \r\nwomen who have suffered violence against their own \r\nflesh. Nevertheless, they have the strength to shine a \r\nlight and share it with others. If indigenous peoples are \r\nable to achieve their freedom and, above all, their self-\r\ndetermination, then all international norms will lead to \r\ndignified policies at the national level. It is not possible \r\nto understand indigenous rights if you do not see them \r\nas being part of the daily life of our populations. That \r\n14-54394 19/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nis why this is a new opportunity for us to open common \r\nspace for reciprocity, mutual respect, the fullness of life \r\nand the future of all of humankind.\r\nI see a lot of young faces here. These young people \r\ngreatly inspire us. They come from the various nations \r\nof the world, and they include many young leaders. I \r\npay tribute to Mexico, which has gone to great lengths \r\nto promote the draft resolution that we are going to \r\nadopt, but I would also pay tribute to our brother Evo \r\nMorales, who leads the Plurinational State of Bolivia \r\nand very many other fights that, in years past, when \r\nwe were younger, seemed to be impossible to fight. \r\nI also pay tribute to the young people in the various \r\ndiplomatic missions here at the United Nations. When \r\nI walked through the United Nations corridors with \r\na police escort, a lot of those present here were a lot \r\nyounger than they are now.\r\nI am a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. I was the first \r\nAmbassador of the first International Year of Indigenous \r\nPeoples in 1993, I was appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral at the time, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and \r\nhe gave me the opportunity to visit the 29 nations of \r\nthe world where indigenous people live. Today I see \r\nthem represented here, and I am very proud of that fact, \r\nbecause I can see that the way is open. We have to build \r\nit together. Peace is life. Peace is education and peace \r\nis culture.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.1. I now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Gettu (Department for General Assembly and \r\nConference Management): In connection with draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.1, entitled “Outcome document of the \r\nhigh-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly \r\nknown as the World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples”, I wish to put on record the following statement \r\nof financial implications on behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly.\r\nUnder the terms of paragraphs 31 and 40 of draft \r\nresolutions A/69/L.1, the General Assembly would, \r\nfirst, request the Secretary-General, in consultation and \r\ncooperation with indigenous peoples, the Inter-Agency \r\nSupport Group on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues and \r\nMember States, to begin the development, within \r\nexisting resources, of a system-wide action plan to \r\nensure a coherent approach to achieving the ends of the \r\nDeclaration and to report to the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session, through the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, on progress made.\r\nSecondly, it would request the Secretary-General, \r\nin consultation with the Inter-Agency Support Group \r\nand Member States, and taking into account the views \r\nexpressed by the indigenous people, to report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventieth session on the \r\nimplementation of the draft resolution and present \r\noptions to the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession, through the Economic and Social Council, \r\nincluding recommendations regarding, first, using \r\nmodified and improved existing United Nations \r\nmechanisms to achieve the aims of the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous People; \r\nsecondly, ways to enhance a coherent, system-wide \r\napproach to achieving the ends of the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; and \r\nthirdly, concrete proposals to enable the participation \r\nof indigenous peoples’ representatives and institutions, \r\nbuilding on the Secretary-General’s report on ways and \r\nmeans of promoting participation in the United Nations \r\nof indigenous peoples’ representatives on the issues \r\naffecting them (A/HRC/21/24).\r\nThe requested activities referred to in the draft \r\nresolution related to paragraph 1 of the biennial \r\nprogramme plan and priorities for the period 2014-2015 \r\n(A/67/6/Rev.1) and section 2 of the programme budget \r\nfor the biennium 2014-2015, “General Assembly and \r\nEconomic and Social Council affairs and conference \r\nmanagement”.\r\nPursuant to paragraphs 31 and 40 of the draft \r\nresolution, the request for documentation would \r\nconstitute an addition to the documentation workloads \r\nof the Department for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement of two pre-session documents of 8,500 \r\nwords each in all six languages. This would entail \r\nadditional requirements in the amount of $100,800 \r\nfor documentation service in 2015. As additional \r\nconference- servicing requirement of $100,800 \r\nfor 2015 under section 2, “General Assembly and \r\nEconomic and Social Council affairs and conference \r\nmanagement”, would be required under the programme \r\nbudget for the biennium 2014-2015 to implement the \r\nadditional workload. No provision has been made in \r\nthe programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015 \r\nfor the implementation of the activities requested \r\nunder paragraphs 31 and 40 of the draft resolution. \r\nAt the current stage, it is not possible to identify \r\n20/21 14-54394\r\nA/69/PV.4 22/09/2014\r\nactivities within the section of the programme budget \r\nfor the biennium 2014-2015 that could be terminated, \r\ndeferred, curtailed or modified during the biennium. It \r\nis therefore necessary that additional resources in the \r\namount of $100,800 be provided through an additional \r\nappropriation for the biennium 2014-2015.\r\nIt may be recalled that, under the procedures \r\nestablished by the General Assembly in its resolutions \r\n41/213 and 42/211, a contingency fund is established \r\nfor each biennium to accommodate additional \r\nexpenditures derived from legislative mandates not \r\nprovided for in the programme budget for those years. \r\nIf additional expenditures were proposed that exceeded \r\nthe resources available from the contingency fund, the \r\nactivities concerned will be implemented only through \r\nthe redeployment of resources from low-priority areas \r\nor the modification of existing activities. Otherwise, \r\nsuch additional activities would have to be deferred to \r\nlater in the biennium.\r\nShould the General Assembly adopt draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.1, it is estimated that an additional appropriation \r\nof $101,800 would be required. It is anticipated that this \r\nrequirement cannot be met from within the resources \r\nof the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015. \r\nAccordingly, the General Assembly is requested to \r\napprove an additional appropriation representing a \r\ncharge against the contingency fund in the amount \r\nof $101,800 under section 2, “General Assembly and \r\nEconomic and Social Council Affairs and Conference \r\nManagement,” in the programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2014-2015.\r\nThe attention of the General Assembly is therefore \r\ndrawn to the present statement of programme budget \r\nimplications. During the main part of the sixty-\r\nninth session, the Fifth Committee will examine \r\nboth a detailed statement of the programme budget \r\nimplications arising from the draft resolution and the \r\nreport of the Advisory Committee on Administrative \r\nand Budgetary Questions thereon.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.1, entitled “Outcome document of the high-\r\nlevel plenary meeting of the General Assembly known \r\nas the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples”. May I \r\ntake it that the General Assembly wishes to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/69/L.1 was adopted (resolution \r\n69/2).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I give the \r\nf loor to the observer of the Observer State of the Holy \r\nSee for a statement.\r\nMonsignor Urbanczyk (Holy See): First, I wish \r\nto congratulate the President on convening this high-\r\nlevel plenary meeting of the General Assembly, known \r\nas the World Conference on Indigenous Peoples. My \r\ndelegation has worked hard in a constructive way and \r\nin a spirit of goodwill to make the outcome document \r\n(resolution 69/2) a success. On the other hand, my \r\ndelegation would be remiss in its duty if it did not point \r\nout areas where it strongly disagrees with the text. In \r\nthat regard, my delegation wishes to make the following \r\nreservations on paragraph 13 of the resolution.\r\nWith reference to sexual and reproductive health \r\nand so-called reproductive rights and other language \r\non which the Holy See registered reservations at the \r\nUnited Nations International Conference on Population \r\nand Development (ICPD) and at the Fourth World \r\nConference on Women, we reiterate these reservations \r\nas set out more fully in the report of the ICPD and in \r\nthe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. In \r\nparticular, the ICPD rejects recourse to abortion for \r\nfamily planning and denies that it creates any new rights \r\nin this regard. My delegation will continue to respect \r\nand promote the rights of the indigenous peoples.\r\nFinally, my delegation takes this opportunity to \r\nreiterate the long-standing commitment of the Holy See \r\nto promoting the integral development of the more than \r\n370 million indigenous people in the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I wish \r\nto express my sincere thanks to Ms. Marjon Kamara, \r\nPermanent Representative of Liberia, and Mr. Andrej \r\nLogar, Permanent Representative of Slovenia, who \r\nso ably and patiently conducted the discussions and \r\ncomplex negotiations in the informal consultations in \r\norder to bring them to a successful conclusion. I am \r\nsure that members of the Assembly join me in extending \r\nour sincere appreciation.\r\nRepresentatives are reminded that the first and \r\nsecond interactive round tables will be held concurrently \r\nthis afternoon at 3 p.m. in Conference Room 4 in \r\nthe General Assembly Building and the Trusteeship \r\nCouncil Chamber, respectively.\r\nInteractive round table 1, entitled “United Nations \r\nsystem action to implement the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples”, will be co-chaired by Her Excellency \r\n14-54394 21/21\r\n22/09/2014 A/69/PV.4\r\nMrs. Edita Hrdá, Permanent Representative of the \r\nCzech Republic to the United Nations, and Mr. Ghazali \r\nOhorella, Representative of the Pacific Indigenous \r\nRegion.\r\nInteractive round table 2, entitled “Implementing \r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples at the national and \r\nlocal level”, will be co-chaired by His Excellency \r\nMr. David Choquehuanca, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, and Mr. Joseph \r\nOle Simmel, Representative of the African Indigenous \r\nRegion.\r\nThe third interactive round table and the interactive \r\npanel discussion will be held concurrently tomorrow \r\nafternoon at 3 p.m. in the North Lawn Building in \r\nConference Room 4 and the General Assembly Hall, \r\nrespectively.\r\nInteractive round table 3, entitled “Indigenous \r\npeoples’ lands, territories and resources”, will be \r\nco-chaired by His Excellency Mr. Pita Sharples, \r\nMinister of Maori Affairs of New Zealand, and Ms. Joan \r\nCarling, Representative of the Asia Indigenous Region.\r\nThe interactive panel discussion entitled \r\n“Indigenous priorities for the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda” will be co-chaired by Ms. Patricia \r\nBalbuena, Vice-Minister for Interculturality of Peru, \r\nand Ms. Jannie Lasimbang, Representative of the Asia \r\nIndigenous Region.\r\nI wish participants profitable discussions.\r\nI would like to express special thanks — I think \r\nwe all do — to two people: Ms. Mirna Cunningham \r\nand Mr. Les Malezer, who have been at the service of \r\nthis historic meeting. They have been at the service of \r\nall representatives of indigenous peoples. Once again, I \r\nwish participants very profitable discussions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.\r\n"
