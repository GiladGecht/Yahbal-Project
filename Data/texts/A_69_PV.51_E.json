We align ourselves with the statement to be \r\ndelivered by the representative of Bolivia on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to once again \r\ncongratulate the Government and the people of Samoa \r\non hosting the very successful Third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States (SIDS). \r\nWe also acknowledge the leadership and efforts of \r\nthose who contributed to and played an instrumental \r\nrole in achieving a strong outcome document, the SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway \r\n(Samoa Pathway). The Samoa Pathway has made its \r\nplace in the United Nations history books as the first-\r\never United Nations conference to close its negotiations \r\nin New York and thereby allow the time in Samoa to be \r\nused to deepen discussions on partnerships.\r\nAs the General Assembly adopts the draft \r\nresolution containing the outcome of the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates (A/69/L.6), allow me to highlight a few key \r\npoints. Despite progress in addressing our challenges, \r\nSIDS still experience gaps in the implementation of \r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy for the Further Implementation of the \r\nProgramme of Action for the Sustainable Development \r\nof Small Island Developing States. The Samoa Pathway, \r\nif fully implemented, will set the course for a shift in \r\nthe way we collaborate on development.\r\nThe Samoa Pathway is a concise, focused and \r\naction-oriented document that requires us to move away \r\nfrom the business-as-usual approach. Providing a road \r\nmap and an implementable strategy is only a first step. \r\nThe question now is: How can we effectively implement \r\nthe Pathway and deliver on the commitments made to \r\nSIDS? And how do we make sure that no SIDS are left \r\nbehind in the post-2015 development agenda?\r\nFirst, meeting the sustainable development needs \r\nof SIDS requires efforts from all of us. The theme of \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.51\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n51st plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 14 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n2/12 14-62672\r\nA/69/PV.51 14/11/2014\r\nthe Conference — the sustainable development of SIDS \r\nthrough genuine and durable partnerships — highlighted \r\nthe fact that commitments have been made to \r\nstrengthen international cooperation at all levels. The \r\nConference stressed that such partnerships should be \r\nbased on mutual trust and accountability and that SIDS \r\nshould be equal partners in them. Genuine and durable \r\npartnerships are key for supporting the implementation \r\nof our concrete targets and goals. They must involve the \r\nprivate sector, civil society, youth, women, persons with \r\ndisabilities and older persons. Capacity-building and \r\ninstitution-strengthening for SIDS, rather than endless \r\nworkshops, are critical for SIDS to take ownership of \r\ntheir sustainable development and build their resilience.\r\nFor our partners, more discipline will be required \r\nto fulfil long-standing promises in the form of \r\ncommitments that give us the tools and resources \r\nwe need to plan for the future. For our part, we must \r\nexercise more discipline when it comes to identifying \r\nwhere we most need support and demonstrating that \r\ninvestments are put to good use. The international \r\nand regional systems must build an implementation \r\nmechanism that ensures that our goals are met and that \r\nmakes corrections if we start to veer off course.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, we welcome the \r\napproximately 300 partnerships registered in Samoa \r\nthat address key SIDS priorities: sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment, climate change and disaster risk \r\nmanagement, oceans, seas and biodiversity, social \r\ndevelopment in SIDS, health and non-communicable \r\ndiseases, youth and women, sustainable energy, water \r\nand sanitation, food security and waste management.\r\nSecondly, effective implementation requires \r\nsufficient and predictable means, including financing, \r\ncapacity-building, technology transfer, data collection \r\nand management, partnerships and technical \r\ncooperation, and institutional support. The provision \r\nof adequate means of implementation will help deliver \r\non all commitments. In this connection, we stress \r\nthe importance of including SIDS priorities in the \r\ndiscussions and future outcome of the third international \r\nconference on financing for development, which will \r\nbe one of the important inputs regarding means of \r\nimplementation for the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThirdly, we need to track progress. We need a \r\nrobust global monitoring system that strengthens \r\naccountability at all levels in the follow-up to the \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action, \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \r\nof the Barbados Programme of Action for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States, and \r\nthe Samoa Pathway.\r\nThe review of the United Nations system’s support \r\nto SIDS, which was agreed in Apia, will most certainly \r\ncontribute to improving accountability and improving \r\nthe delivery of commitments made for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of SIDS. This will allow the United \r\nNations system to be more effective as a key partner \r\nand may also require the SIDS to ready themselves \r\nfor global development shifts. We should prepare to \r\ntransform the Samoa Pathway into action including \r\nthrough national sustainable development strategies \r\nand goals. We look forward to the Secretary-General’s \r\nrecommendations on parameters for this review. The \r\nrole of the high-level political forum in the follow-up \r\nto the implementation of the Samoa Pathway is critical. \r\nWe reiterate our strong request that the adequate time \r\nof a full day be allocated to the follow-up on the Samoa \r\nPathway in the body’s meetings.\r\nLastly, the Samoa Pathway is a fundamental and \r\ncritical road map for us SIDS. However, it will not \r\ndeliver on its objective of achieving our sustainable \r\ndevelopment if it is not integrated in the relevant \r\nprocesses of the post-2015 development agenda. An \r\ninclusive post-2015 development agenda must address \r\nthe needs and priorities of countries in particular \r\nsituations, such as SIDS. Not addressing climate \r\nchange or ocean degradation, which are two of the main \r\ndevelopment inhibitors for SIDS, will result in leaving \r\nmany behind.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to reiterate our sincere \r\ngratitude to our colleagues and partners who have heard \r\nSIDS’ concerns throughout the process and have made \r\nefforts in reaching consensus. It is my sincere hope \r\nthat the next international conference of SIDS will not \r\ninclude a section entitled “Implementation gaps”.\r\nMr. Tupouniua (Tonga): I am honoured to be \r\nspeaking on behalf of the 12 Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) present at the United Nations, \r\nnamely, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, \r\nKiribati, the Republic of Marshall Islands, Nauru, \r\nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \r\nTuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country Tonga.\r\nAt the outset, the Pacific SIDS would like to align \r\nthemselves with the statement just delivered on behalf \r\nof the Alliance of Small Island States. \r\n14-62672 3/12\r\n14/11/2014 A/69/PV.51\r\nI take this opportunity to profoundly thank \r\nand congratulate the Government and people of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa on the memorable hosting \r\nof the Third International Conference on Small Island \r\nDeveloping States, in September this year. Also, as the \r\nregion that played host to the Conference for the first \r\ntime ever, we are particularly proud of its success. Our \r\ngratitude also extends to the co-Chairs, New Zealand \r\nand Singapore, the members of the bureau, the United \r\nNations Secretariat and all participants that contributed.\r\nThe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway), which we look \r\nforward to adopting, reaffirms the special case of SIDS \r\nand the vulnerabilities and challenges they face with \r\nregard  to the effects of natural disasters and climate \r\nchange, among other things, and stresses the continued \r\nimportance of the support of the international \r\ncommunity in pursuit of sustainable development.\r\nThe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States is a \r\ncrucial blueprint for broad-based improvements to the \r\nwelfare of populations in all islands. It recognizes that \r\nfor sustainable development to be possible, islands must \r\ntake requisite actions in all three dimensions — social, \r\nenvironmental and economic. The plan elaborates a \r\ndetailed road map — based on actions across 20 different \r\nheadings, from climate change to marine resources, \r\ntourism to trade, and health to culture — that is one of \r\nthe more detailed and valuable outputs that has resulted \r\nfrom cooperative action among small island developing \r\nStates in all regions.\r\nHowever, Pacific SIDS acknowledge that \r\nimplementation of the Mauritius Strategy has at times \r\nbeen uneven. Some islands especially affected by the \r\nglobal economic recession have regressed. In spite of \r\nthe considerable efforts of Pacific States, many have \r\nbeen unable to attain internationally agreed goals \r\nand targets, including those set out in the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. These shortfalls are best \r\nunderstood as a reflection of the enormous challenges \r\nfaced by Pacific SIDS and by SIDS globally. With low \r\nagricultural capacity, a small base of natural resources \r\nand some unique infrastructure challenges, often \r\ncompounded by geographic remoteness, SIDS face a set \r\nof additional hurdles in efforts to promote sustained, \r\ninclusive, and equitable economic growth. And these \r\nchallenges are compounded by the reality of escalating \r\nadverse impacts of climate change. Extreme weather \r\nevents, rising sea levels and ocean acidification, among \r\nother impacts, will make it harder to accomplish gains \r\nin sustainable development.\r\nThese issues were emphasized by the International \r\nConference in Samoa, whose theme was “The \r\nsustainable development of small island developing \r\nStates through genuine and durable partnerships”. \r\nThe Samoa Pathway follows the Mauritius Strategy \r\nin specifying actions that SIDS, together with their \r\npartners, can undertake in a variety of areas to further \r\nall three pillars of sustainable development. As the \r\ntheme of the SIDS Conference stressed, partnerships \r\nand the support of the international community are \r\ncritical to success. Pacific SIDS welcome the annual \r\nadoption by consensus of resolutions on this topic as an \r\nimportant signal of that continued genuine and durable \r\npartnership.\r\nNow the time for implementation has come. \r\nAlready we are working in the Second Committee to \r\nfollow up on three key areas: first, how to monitor the \r\nsuccess of the partnerships announced in Samoa, as \r\nwell as future partnerships; secondly, how to continue \r\nthe conversation in future United Nations deliberations, \r\nincluding the high-level political forum; and thirdly, how \r\nUnited Nations support for SIDS can be strengthened. \r\nHow we define the follow-up will determine how the \r\ncommitments made will be translated to success on the \r\nground.\r\nFinally, we Pacific SIDS reiterate our commitment \r\nto taking ownership and leadership and to working \r\nwith relevant stakeholders at all levels in ensuring \r\nthat the Samoa Pathway attains the success that it \r\ndeserves, while also laying a solid foundation that will \r\nserve as a springboard that complements the pursuit \r\nof the sustainable development goals set by the global \r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the 14 States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM). CARICOM aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nNauru on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States.\r\nAt the outset, CARICOM wishes to reiterate its \r\ngratitude to the Government of Samoa for hosting the \r\nsuccessful Third International Conference on Small \r\nIsland Developing States. The pride of the Samoan \r\npeople permeated every aspect of the Conference in \r\nApia. We wish also to acknowledge the support of \r\n4/12 14-62672\r\nA/69/PV.51 14/11/2014\r\nMember States and the United Nations system during \r\nthe preparatory process and the Conference itself. \r\nThe unique and particular vulnerabilities faced \r\nby small island developing States (SIDS), which \r\nconstrain our development, are well known. As such, \r\nthe international community recognized SIDS as a \r\nspecial case for sustainable development in Agenda 21. \r\nThat recognition is echoed in the Barbados Programme \r\nof Action, the Mauritius Strategy for the Further \r\nImplementation of the Programme of Action for the \r\nSustainable Development of Small Island Developing \r\nStates, the outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development, and now \r\nthe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\nPathway (Samoa Pathway).\r\nFor CARICOM, the Third International Conference \r\non Small Island Developing States and its outcome \r\ndocument, the Samoa Pathway, embody a renewed \r\nglobal commitment to supporting SIDS in their efforts \r\nto achieve sustainable development. The outcome \r\ndocument, by building on the lessons learned since \r\nthe Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius \r\nStrategy, provides SIDS with a renewed vision and \r\nroad map for sustainable development. Accordingly, \r\nthe need for the full and effective implementation \r\nof the Samoa Pathway cannot be overstated. In that \r\nregard, CARICOM member States look forward to \r\nworking with stakeholders at the national, regional \r\nand international levels. We also look forward to the \r\ncreation of the partnership framework, as called for in \r\nparagraph 101 of the Samoa Pathway, which will play \r\nan integral role in ensuring the effective follow-up and \r\nreview of the 300 partnerships and initiatives registered \r\nin Samoa, with a total value of $1.9 billion reflected in \r\npledges.\r\nThe adoption of the Samoa Pathway comes at \r\na critical moment for us, as we find ourselves on the \r\ncusp of deliberations on the elaboration of a post-\r\n2015 development agenda that must set the world on a \r\nsustainable development course for current and future \r\ngenerations. That agenda must be underpinned by a \r\nstrong commitment to an inclusive, transformative, \r\npeople-centred development agenda with poverty \r\neradication at its core. The post-2015 development \r\nagenda must also recognize the differences among \r\ncountries and the need to accommodate those \r\ndifferences within the context of the new development \r\nagenda.\r\nCARICOM firmly believes that the Samoa Pathway \r\nconstitutes a foundational input to shape the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, taking into consideration \r\nthe unique and particular challenges that SIDS face, \r\nincluding areas such as access to concessional financing \r\nfor development, debt relief, poverty eradication, the \r\nscourge of non-communicable diseases, challenges \r\nin the development and management of statistics and \r\nstatistical systems, climate change adaptation and \r\nmitigation, and technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding. We call on Member States to integrate \r\nSIDS priorities into the elaboration of a post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nCARICOM also recognizes the role of the high-\r\nlevel political forum on sustainable development in \r\nproviding oversight for the SIDS agenda. In that regard, \r\nwe reiterate the call for priority to be given to SIDS \r\nissues on the forum’s agenda and for the forum to \r\nprovide the necessary monitoring and follow-up of the \r\nBarbados Programme of Action, the Mauritius Strategy \r\nand the Samoa Pathway.\r\nMr. Neo (Singapore): At the outset, Singapore aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nNauru on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States \r\n(AOSIS).\r\nJust over two months ago, Samoa hosted the \r\nhighly successful Third International Conference \r\non Small Island Developing States, in Apia, from \r\n1 to 4 September. Our warmest congratulations and \r\nheartfelt thanks go to the Government and people of \r\nSamoa for their wonderful hospitality and for ensuring \r\nthat the Conference was a resounding success.\r\nThe adoption of the SIDS Accelerated Modalities \r\nof Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway) by the \r\nConference was the culmination of many months of \r\nhard work by all stakeholders involved. It was also a \r\ntestament to the goodwill and spirit of international \r\ncooperation that were so evident during the negotiation \r\nprocess. As co-Chair of the Preparatory Committee \r\nof the Conference, Singapore was privileged to play \r\na small role by ensuring that the negotiations on the \r\nSamoa Pathway were concluded in a timely fashion in \r\nNew York, ahead of the Conference itself.\r\nNow that the Conference is over, we need keep \r\nup the momentum to focus on the full implementation \r\nof the Samoa Pathway and the many partnerships \r\nlaunched at the Conference. In that regard, Singapore \r\n14-62672 5/12\r\n14/11/2014 A/69/PV.51\r\nsees the adoption of the Samoa Pathway by the General \r\nAssembly as a crucial milestone. It will signal the \r\ninternational community’s continuing commitment and \r\nresolve to ensure the full implementation of the Samoa \r\nPathway.\r\nSingapore is happy to do its part to implement \r\nthe Samoa Pathway and has prepared a dedicated \r\nthree-year technical cooperation package for small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) under the Singapore \r\nCooperation Programme. The package will provide \r\nfurther customized technical assistance and fellowships \r\nin areas that are relevant to the capacity-building \r\nneeds of SIDS. That includes customized programmes \r\nfor senior SIDS officials in areas such as sustainable \r\ndevelopment and climate change, disaster management, \r\npublic health and non-traditional security. Singapore \r\nwill also offer 150 civil aviation fellowships for courses \r\nat the Singapore Aviation Academy and 30 fellowship \r\nawards for the Maritime Public Leaders’ Programme \r\nconducted by the Maritime and Port Authority of \r\nSingapore. We hope that those programmes will make \r\na meaningful contribution to the implementation of \r\nthe Samoa Pathway through capacity-building and \r\nincreased resilience. Singapore stands ready to work \r\nwith our fellow SIDS and our partners in making the \r\nSamoa Pathway a reality.\r\nMr. Maksimychev (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): We welcome the outcomes of the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, in Apia. We thank the Government and people \r\nof Samoa for their superb organization of that important \r\nmeeting and for their hospitality. We view the outcome \r\ndocument of the Conference, the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa \r\nPathway), as a key benchmark for international efforts \r\nto ensure the sustainable development of that category \r\nof countries and as a much-needed contribution to \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nGuided by friendly relations and responsible \r\npartnership, the Russian Federation has consistently \r\nincreased its donor assistance to small island \r\ndeveloping States. Our overall assistance to that \r\ncategory of countries for the past four years stands at \r\nabout $20 million. We focus our assistance on existing, \r\ncritically important areas, in particular modernizing \r\ninfrastructure, strengthening public administration \r\nmechanisms, developing trade potential, improving \r\neducational systems and health care, ensuring \r\nenergy security and enhancing resilience to natural \r\ndisasters. Our goal is to draw on existing capacities \r\nand experience in practical cooperation to ensure \r\nthe effective implementation of the Samoa Pathway \r\nprogramme. As a first step, we are currently exploring \r\nthe possibility of collaborating with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme on a major long-term project \r\nto improve disaster preparedness for small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nTo conclude, allow me to say that we support the \r\nadoption by the General Assembly of draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.6, on the Samoa Pathway.\r\nMs. Chen Yingzhu (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nChina welcomes the Third International Conference \r\non Small Island Developing States (SIDS), which was \r\nsuccessfully held from 1 to 4 September in Apia. We \r\nalso welcome the adoption of the outcome document, \r\nthe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\nPathway (Samoa Pathway). We would like to express our \r\nappreciation to the United Nations and the host country \r\nSamoa for their work.\r\nWe support the proposal adopted at the Conference \r\non the establishment of effective long-term partnerships \r\nto promote the sustainable development of small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) and focus attention on the \r\ndevelopment concerns of SIDS. In China’s view, looking \r\nforward, we should concentrate on the following areas. \r\nFirst, we should take on the challenge of climate change \r\ntogether. Secondly, we should formulate the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda as scheduled. Thirdly, we should \r\nearnestly implement our commitment to international \r\ncooperation for development. Fourthly, we should \r\nestablish a more rational international system of \r\ngovernance.\r\nIn recent years China has furthered its practical \r\ncooperation with SIDS and has proved itself an honest, \r\nlasting and reliable partner for them. Since the beginning \r\nof this year China has provided 23 SIDS with 235 \r\nassistance projects amounting to a total of ¥1.5 billion. \r\nIn November 2013, our Government announced that it \r\nwould provide ¥1 billion in concessional loans to SIDS \r\nof the region. Meanwhile, the China Development \r\nBank has announced a $1-billion special loan to \r\nsupport infrastructure development, water supply \r\nfacilities, small hydropower stations, ecological farms \r\nand bio-gas technologies in SIDS. We are focusing \r\non helping these countries remove the bottlenecks in \r\ntheir sustainable development.  In the future China will \r\nwork with the countries concerned on implementing \r\n6/12 14-62672\r\nA/69/PV.51 14/11/2014\r\nthe Samoa Pathway and will continue with its efforts to \r\nhelp them achieve sustainable development.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker \r\nin the debate on these items. We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolution A/69/L.6.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): In connection \r\nwith draft resolution A/69/L.6, entitled “SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway”, \r\nI wish to put on the record the following statement \r\nof financial implications on behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly.\r\nUnder the terms of paragraphs 101, 119 and \r\n124 (b) of the outcome document, which is annexed to \r\ndraft resolution A/69/L.6, the General Assembly would \r\nrequest the Secretary-General, in consultation with \r\nMember States, to present recommendations, including \r\nthrough the use of intergovernmental mechanisms, for \r\na partnership framework to monitor and ensure the full \r\nimplementation of pledges and commitments through \r\npartnerships for small island developing States (SIDS). \r\nThe framework should ensure that partnerships focus \r\non the priorities of small island developing States, \r\nidentify new opportunities to advance the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of and ensure the full implementation \r\nof the Barbados Programme of Action, the Mauritius \r\nStrategy and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nAction (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway). The \r\nrecommendations should be presented to the General \r\nAssembly for consideration and action at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession.\r\nThe Assembly would request that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral conduct a comprehensive review of the United \r\nNations system’s support for small island developing \r\nStates with a view to enhancing the overall effectiveness \r\nof such support and the respective roles in supporting \r\nthe development of small island developing States, and \r\nwould invite the General Assembly, at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession, to determine the parameters of the review. \r\nThe Assembly would also request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, building on previous reports, to provide to the \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session the findings of the \r\nreview and his recommendations thereon in his regular \r\nreport entitled “Follow-up to and implementation of \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment of Small Island Developing States”.\r\nThe Assembly would request the Department of \r\nEconomic and Social Affairs to continue to maintain \r\na partnerships platform focused on the small island \r\ndeveloping States and to regularly convene the \r\ninter-agency consultative group to report on the full \r\nimplementation of the Barbados Programme of Action, \r\nthe Mauritius Strategy and the Samoa Pathway, with \r\nadequate and timely analysis based on relevant targets \r\nand indicators relevant to small island developing \r\nStates, in order to ensure accountability at all levels.\r\nThe Samoa Pathway calls on the United Nations \r\nsystem to continue to support small island developing \r\nStates in pursuing their sustainable development and \r\nimplementation of the Samoa Pathway. It assigns \r\nenhanced responsibilities to the Department of Economic \r\nand Social Affairs (DESA). While interdepartmental \r\ncollaboration will be pursued whenever possible, the \r\nDepartment of Economic and Social Affairs will take \r\nthe lead in coordinating implementation and follow-\r\nup to the outcome document, keeping Member States \r\ninformed, through solid analysis and data, as well as \r\nmonitoring and reporting on implementation and the \r\npartnerships that were announced before and during the \r\nSamoa Conference.\r\nPursuant to paragraph 101 of the outcome \r\ndocument, DESA is undertaking the necessary \r\nconsultations with Member States. At the end of 2014, \r\nit will conduct a survey to elicit Member States’ views \r\non the kind of partnership framework that would best \r\nenable monitoring and ensure the full implementation \r\nof commitments made through partnerships. It will \r\nalso consult other stakeholders engaged in partnerships \r\nthrough expert group meetings and other channels. \r\nIn September 2015, the General Assembly is \r\nexpected to provide further guidance on the framework, \r\nbased on the recommendations of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. The framework is expected to include, among \r\nother elements, a Web-based partnerships platform, \r\nfor which the Department has already developed a \r\nprototype. Linking the follow-up to partnerships from \r\nSamoa with the track following up on the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) will allow the SIDS partnership framework \r\nto benefit from lessons learned and synergies with the \r\nRio+20 partnership follow-up.\r\n14-62672 7/12\r\n14/11/2014 A/69/PV.51\r\nWith regard to the request contained in paragraph \r\n119, the General Assembly is invited to determine the \r\nparameters of the review of United Nations system \r\nsupport to SIDS at its sixty-ninth session. It should \r\nbe noted that in paragraph 9 of draft resolution \r\nA/C.2/69/L.24, which is under consideration by the \r\nSecond Committee, the Assembly would request the \r\nJoint Inspection Unit to provide recommendations to \r\nassist the Assembly in determining the parameters \r\nof the review. Given that consultations regarding the \r\npartnership framework and the system-wide review \r\nare ongoing among Member States, it is not possible at \r\nthis stage to determine the resource requirements for \r\nparagraphs 101 and 119. When the consultations with \r\nMember States are completed and the parameters of \r\nthe review have been identified, the Secretary-General \r\nwill revert to the General Assembly with budgetary \r\nimplications, if any, in accordance with established \r\nprocedures.\r\nPursuant to operative paragraph 124 (b), DESA \r\nwill, first, develop a road map for implementation of \r\nthe Samoa Pathway; secondly, support and coordinate \r\nthe development of targets and indicators for the \r\noutcome document and, thirdly, carry out research and \r\nanalysis of national, regional and international actions \r\nbeing undertaken by a range of stakeholders. The work \r\non targets and indicators will focus on the specific \r\nprovisions contained in the Samoa Pathway. It will also \r\nbe closely related to the targets being identified by the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the follow-up to the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nThe work on developing targets and indicators, \r\nas well as further in-depth, analytical and research-\r\noriented work, will allow DESA to ground policy \r\nrecommendations on SIDS, on behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nhigh-level political forum, in scientific analysis and \r\nsound data. DESA will mobilize its various divisions with \r\nexpertise in SIDS, data and statistics, and vulnerability. \r\nIt will work in collaboration with the Office of the High \r\nRepresentative for the Least Developed Countries, \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries and Small Island \r\nDeveloping States and experts in the United Nations \r\nsystem and beyond, seeking complementarity with \r\nother ongoing processes.\r\nIn order to implement the requests contained \r\nin paragraph 124 (b) of the outcome document, \r\nDESA will need to undertake substantial analytical, \r\nquantitative and coordination work. The additional \r\nrequirements arising from the additional mandate will \r\ninvolve developing appropriate targets and indicators \r\nfor Samoa Pathway implementation, with emphasis on \r\ndata and evidence-based reporting, and ensuring the \r\nscience-policy interface. That will include developing \r\na number of targets and indicators to assess progress \r\non the main provisions of the Samoa Pathway. Those \r\ntargets and indicators will need to be consistent with the \r\ntargets and indicators being developed in the context of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda.\r\nIn that regard, a new sustainable development \r\nofficer post at the P-4 level in the SIDS Unit would \r\nbe required to undertake substantive analysis and \r\nresearch on thematic issues, with emphasis on data \r\nand evidence-based reporting and ensuring the \r\nscience-policy interface, including the development of \r\ntargets and indicators for each relevant paragraph of the \r\nSamoa Pathway.\r\nThe substantive analytical work, which will be \r\nundertaken on a recurrent basis, will ensure support \r\nto the effective follow-up, monitoring and reporting \r\non the implementation of the Samoa Pathway, filling \r\na critical gap in the support for SIDS with respect to \r\nthe development of quantitative targets and indicators \r\nfor each thematic chapter of the Pathway, leading up \r\nto the mid-term review in five years. The cycle will \r\nthen continue until the convening of the next SIDS \r\nconference, which, based on the current cycle, will be \r\nin 10 years.\r\nShould the General Assembly adopt draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.6, additional resources in the total amount of \r\n$470,100 would be required for the establishment of \r\none temporary post, starting 2016, at the P-4 level, \r\nunder section 9, “Economic and Social Affairs”, to \r\nthe amount of $358,000; section 29D, “Office of \r\nCentral Support Services”, to the amount of $73,500; \r\nand section 37, “Staff Assessment”, to the amount of \r\n$38,600, for which consideration will be made in the \r\ncontext of the proposed programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2016-2017.\r\nAccordingly, the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.6 would not give rise to any financial \r\nimplications for the programme budget for the biennium \r\n2014-2015.\r\nThe President: The Assembly shall now take a \r\ndecision on draft resolutions A/69/L.6, entitled “SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway”. \r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt it?\r\n8/12 14-62672\r\nA/69/PV.51 14/11/2014\r\nDraft resolution A/69/L.6 was adopted (resolution \r\n69/15).\r\nThe President: Before giving the f loor to the \r\nspeakers in explanation of vote on the resolution just \r\nadopted, may I remind delegations that explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMrs. Robl (United States of America): The United \r\nStates would like once again to thank the Government \r\nand people of Samoa, and the United Nations offices \r\nand agencies and the intergovernmental organizations \r\nthat have worked in partnership with Samoa to host \r\na very successful conference. We were very pleased \r\nto be closely involved in the negotiations at United \r\nNations Headquarters, in New York, that produced \r\nthe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\nPathway (Samoa Pathway), which we have just adopted \r\n(resolution 69/15, annex), and we join in applauding it.\r\nWhile we are pleased to hear that there are no \r\nprogramme budget implications for the current budget \r\ncycle, we find the Secretariat’s oral statement in that \r\nregard to go beyond what is needed to support the \r\noutcome document, and we question the rationale for the \r\nnumbers, as they have not been adequately considered \r\nby Member States in any appropriate forum. We request \r\nthat the Secretariat evaluate its resources and staffing \r\nin light of budgetary constraints among Member States, \r\nand the imperative to work smarter and more effectively \r\nas we face development and other challenges. We look \r\nforward to discussions in the appropriate forums, and \r\nthus our adoption of the resolution should not be read \r\nas an endorsement of the anticipated budget estimates.\r\nSeparate from the budgetary issues, the United \r\nStates has submitted a written statement, already \r\nincluded in the formal record of the Third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States, \r\nexplaining its position on a few other aspects of the \r\noutcome document.\r\nAs we pause today and remember fondly the \r\nhospitality and leadership of Samoa and the impressive \r\nsuccess of the Conference, the United States takes this \r\nopportunity again to emphasize that it deeply values \r\nits long-standing relationship with the small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) and that we are committed to \r\nworking in partnership with all stakeholders to promote \r\nthe sustainable development of SIDS in all regions \r\nthrough the implementation of the SAMOA Pathway. \r\nMr. Sekiguchi (Japan): My delegation would like \r\nto make an explanation of position after the adoption of \r\nresolution 69/15. \r\nFirst, I would like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe co-Chairs and co-facilitators of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee for their hard work throughout the process. \r\nI also extend my gratitude to the host country, Samoa, \r\nfor its hospitality and diligent work.\r\nJapan is determined to continuously support \r\nthe efforts of the small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) to implement the outcome document of the \r\nSIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\nPathway (Samoa Pathway). Japan is pleased to join \r\nthe consensus on the Samoa Pathway on achieving \r\nsustainable development through genuine and durable \r\npartnerships. This is a priority to which Japan attaches \r\ngreat importance.\r\nIt is, however, deeply regrettable that the estimates \r\non the proposed programme budget 2016-2017 were \r\nnot issued until last evening. Japan believes that cost \r\ninformation should be made available to Member States \r\nwell in advance of the adoption of a resolution. My \r\ndelegation has many questions and reservations about \r\nthe oral statement, including the basis of its estimations \r\nregarding paragraph 124 (b) of the outcome document. \r\nLet me clarify that the costs related to the resolution \r\nshould be considered in the process of the consideration \r\nof the programme budget of the next biennium, in due \r\ncourse. The oral statement is not by any means binding \r\non Japan.\r\nMs. Wierenga (Canada): Canada welcomes \r\nthe adoption of the important outcome document \r\nof the Third International Conference on Small \r\nIsland Developing States (resolution 69/15, annex). \r\nHowever, with regard to the oral report on budgetary \r\nimplications, we are concerned with the Secretariat’s \r\ninterpretation of resource requirements, which goes \r\nbeyond what we understood was needed to support the \r\noutcome document. Furthermore, Canada is disquieted \r\nby the approach taken by the Secretariat in raising this \r\nrequest. We ask that the Secretariat carefully analyse its \r\nresource requirements on the basis of what the General \r\nAssembly needs and introduce them in the approach \r\nforum at the appropriate time. We would stress that the \r\nadoption of today’s resolution is no way an endorsement \r\nor commitment to the financial requirements mentioned \r\nin the oral statement.\r\n14-62672 9/12\r\n14/11/2014 A/69/PV.51\r\nMr. Neelam (Australia): Australia was pleased and \r\nproud to support the Third International Conference on \r\nSmall Island Developing States in Samoa in September \r\nthis year and to contribute to the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa \r\nPathway) outcome document (resolution 69/15, annex). \r\nAt the outset, Australia would like to once again thank \r\nand congratulate the Government and the people of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa for hosting such a \r\nsuccessful conference.\r\nAlthough Australia is not a small island, most of our \r\nneighbours are. The interests of small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) are vitally important to my country, in \r\nparticular because Australia sees the stability and \r\nprosperity of SIDS in our region as integral to that \r\nof our own, but also because we want to see all small \r\nislands in the Pacific and beyond thrive and prosper \r\nand realize their full potential for the benefit of their \r\npeoples.\r\nCritical to that prosperity is the promotion and \r\nrealization of economic growth and the sustainable \r\nmanagement of oceans. One of the strengths of the \r\nSamoa Pathway is the prominence it gives to those vital \r\nissues. We are also very pleased with the focus in the \r\nSamoa Pathway on women’s equality and economic \r\nempowerment and the importance of sound governance. \r\nThose priorities align well with those of Australia’s aid \r\nprogramme, built as it is on the experience of decades \r\nof work with SIDS partners.\r\nAs we move forward, we need to work together in \r\npartnership to implement this important document. We \r\nalso need to forge a post-2015 development agenda that \r\ntakes action on issues identified in the Samoa Pathway, \r\nincluding economic growth, oceans, women’s equality, \r\npeaceful societies and effective institutions. Australia \r\nis pleased to warmly welcome the formal adoption of \r\nthe Samoa Pathway, and we look forward to working \r\ntogether in partnership with SIDS towards its effective \r\nimplementation.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker \r\nin explanation of position. I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Devanlay (European Union): The European \r\nUnion (EU) and its member States are pleased to join \r\nthe consensus on the outcome document of the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway). We reiterate \r\nour commitment to supporting SIDS’ efforts aimed \r\nat achieving their sustainable development, including \r\nthrough the full and effective implementation of \r\nthe Samoa Pathway, in particular the setting up of a \r\npartnership framework.\r\nThe European Union and its member States are \r\nproud of our long-standing tradition of partnership \r\nwith SIDS. We have long supported their efforts to \r\naddress their specific vulnerabilities. We have been, \r\nand remain, a leading donor and key trading partner for \r\nSIDS. The time has come for the EU and SIDS to move \r\nour traditional donor-recipient relationship forward \r\ntowards a more comprehensive relationship.\r\nThe Samoa Conference was an opportunity for us \r\nto strengthen existing partnerships and help establish \r\nnew ones founded on SIDS ownership, mindful of the \r\nlocal context, inclusive of all relevant stakeholders, and \r\nbased on trust, mutual respect, transparency and mutual \r\naccountability, while pursuing measurable objectives \r\nand tangible results. We also express our profound \r\ngratitude to the Government and the people of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the excellent facilities, \r\nstaff and services provided, for the arrangements made \r\nin hosting the Conference, and for the hospitality \r\nextended to the participants.\r\nWe were very surprised, however, to be presented \r\nwith an oral statement from the Programme Planning \r\nand Budget Division on resolution 69/15. We see no \r\njustification for generating an oral statement and \r\ndisagree with some of the rationale given. We understand \r\nthat the numbers were only estimates presented in \r\naccordance with an extensive interpretation of rule 153 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nWe stress that the estimates presented today do \r\nnot prejudge the Secretary-General’s submission to the \r\nAdvisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary \r\nQuestion and the Fifth Committee on a proposed budget \r\nfor the 2016-2017 biennium. We also believe that some \r\nestimates can factually be excluded from consideration \r\nas requirements under the present resolution. Overall, \r\nthese estimates should not be perceived as having been \r\nendorsed by Member States today.\r\nWe are particularly concerned that those estimates \r\ncame unexpectedly, long after negotiations were \r\nover and on the eve of the adoption by the General \r\nAssembly. They do not seem to fully reflect the spirit \r\nof negotiations, especially as regards paragraph 124 (b). \r\nThat paragraph was negotiated in good faith, and at the \r\n10/12 14-62672\r\nA/69/PV.51 14/11/2014\r\ntime of the informals no reference was made to the \r\nneed for additional Department of Economic and Social \r\nAffairs resources so that it could “continue to maintain \r\na partnerships platform... and to regularly convene the \r\ninter-agency consultative group”.\r\nFinally, we strongly believe that increased \r\ntransparency regarding estimate budgetary figures \r\nfor the current or upcoming budget cycles should \r\nbe provided during the negotiation process, in full \r\naccordance with the relevant rules of procedure.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Minister \r\nof Communications and Information Technology of \r\nSamoa.\r\nMr. Aveau (Samoa): On behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of Samoa, it is my privilege and honour \r\nto place on record our deepest appreciation to you, \r\nSir, for your sterling and considerate leadership in \r\nproviding an avenue, in our Assembly’s busy agenda, \r\nfor facilitating the adoption of the Small Island \r\nDeveloping States Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa Pathway). On behalf of all \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS), our partners and \r\nthe whole membership of the Organization, we thank \r\nyou for your support and understanding, as evidenced \r\nin today’s adoption by consensus of the Samoa Pathway \r\n(resolution 69/15, annex). Further, the bureaux of the \r\npreparatory meetings and of the Third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States \r\ndeserve special mention for steadying and guiding our \r\ndeliberations efficiently and with professionalism.\r\nBut our thanks would not be complete without \r\nmentioning the unwavering support of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who is always advocating \r\nfor SIDS issues and leading by example. The Conference \r\nwould not have achieved the success it enjoyed, were \r\nit not for the steadfast leadership of the Conference \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Wu Hongbo, and the supportive \r\nsecretariat he ably led. And to all who contributed to \r\nturning the Samoa Pathway into to what it is today, we \r\noffer our deepest admiration.\r\nThe adoption by the General Assembly of the \r\nSamoa Pathway is a momentous occasion and a high \r\npoint in the enduring efforts of small island developing \r\nStates to focus world attention on their sustainable \r\ndevelopment needs as a United Nations-recognized \r\ngroup facing special circumstances and having \r\ninherent vulnerabilities, not of their choice but due to \r\nfactors completely outside of their control. But every \r\njourney in life has a point of reference. Today, we are \r\ncelebrating another chapter in SIDS’ evolving existence \r\nthat began 29 months ago, when the outcome document \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, “The future we want” (resolution 66/288, \r\nannex), called for the convening in 2014 of the Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates.\r\nThat call was not lost on Samoa’s Prime Minister, \r\nwho, in his statement to the Rio Conference on 22 June \r\n2012, offered Samoa to host the SIDS conference. \r\nAccording to his vision, hosting a global conference \r\nis a rare privilege that comes once a decade, but the \r\nreal honour and motivation lies in the opportunity to \r\nhave the spotlight of international attention fall on \r\nSIDS’ challenges and realities and to share with the \r\ninternational community Samoa’s story about the \r\nprimacy and importance of successful partnerships \r\nfirmly rooted in mutual trust and respect, which, for \r\nover five decades, have been the foundational pillars \r\nof Samoa’s journey as an island nation. It was also \r\nimportant to demonstrate that being SIDS or least \r\ndeveloped countries should not discourage poor and \r\nvulnerable nations from stepping forward to achieve \r\neconomic, social and political progress.\r\nWhen we started the process, it was a leap of faith \r\ninto uncharted waters. Useful signposts along the \r\nway included General Assembly resolution 67/207 of \r\nDecember 2012, welcoming Samoa’s offer to host the \r\nConference; the Assembly’s decision 67/558 of May \r\n2013, on the dates for the Conference; the Assembly’s \r\nsubsequent endorsement of the modalities, in December \r\n2013, in resolution 68/238; and the approval of the \r\noutcome document by the Preparatory Committee in \r\nJuly 2014, seven weeks before the Conference. To cap \r\nit all, the Conference adopted the SAMOA Pathway \r\noutcome document on 4 September.\r\nAt times, those milestones appeared untenable, far-\r\nfetched and unachievable. Some of us at home began \r\nto question whether we had made the right decision to \r\nhost the Conference in the first place, and there was \r\nalways a lingering doubt about whether we had the \r\nperseverance and determination to pull off that national \r\nundertaking. But persevere we did, determined we \r\nwere, and compromise we practiced. Flexibility became \r\nthe norm, but being resolute and principled became our \r\nmoral compass.\r\nTrue to our collective sense of obligation to Pacific \r\ncountries for their trust in us as the host for our region, \r\n14-62672 11/12\r\n14/11/2014 A/69/PV.51\r\nto our SIDS constituency for its continuous support, \r\nand to our partners for their confidence by rallying and \r\nrendering every assistance imaginable to ensure that no \r\none felt let down, we continued to navigate our way \r\nthrough and to tell our story as truthfully as we saw it, \r\nuntroubled by whether people thought foul of us and \r\nour motives. But there was no ulterior goal at all other \r\nthan to share the truth with the rest of the world about \r\nour special case, our challenges and realities, and the \r\nimperative to build and enhance our overall resilience. \r\nAfter all, some of our islands have the high moral \r\nground to insist on having their stories told from the \r\nlens of their experiences, untainted by power politics, \r\nworld agendas, misplaced assumptions and unfounded \r\nconcerns.\r\nLooking back now, any doubts we might have had \r\nabout a successful outcome are truly water under the \r\nbridge. We have the benefit of hindsight and actions \r\nabout which we can speak. Through the unanimous \r\nadoption of resolution 69/15 today, the General \r\nAssembly has rewarded the SIDS’ resolve with its trust \r\nand repaid our fortitude with its confidence and faith. \r\nFor those partners who believed and stood by us from \r\nday one through the thick and thin of the negotiations \r\nand the almost endless logistical preparations, no \r\nreward suffices, because none is expected. In the \r\nAssembly, Samoa and SIDS have found genuine and \r\ndurable friends.\r\nResolution 69/15 is brief, but it belies the level \r\nof detailed discussions necessary to arrive at such an \r\noutcome. The Samoa Pathway is a finely balanced \r\nintergovernmental agreement that has the zeal and \r\nstamp of approval of the United Nations membership. \r\nIt is the blueprint for SIDS sustainable development \r\nfor now and in the immediate future. We hope that \r\nthe increased understanding and appreciation of SIDS \r\nissues and challenges gained at the Conference will \r\nnot be forgotten or relegated in priority due to the \r\ncompeting agendas of more influential Member States.\r\nThe international community has a very full \r\nagenda. The follow-up to the SIDS Conference will \r\nbe part of that agenda and we hope that, amid all \r\nthe demands — political, economic and other — the \r\nrealities of SIDS so clearly spelled out in the Samoa \r\nPathway will be able to retain the attention of the \r\nwider international community. We took seriously the \r\ncommitments given for SIDS at the Conference, and we \r\nwill remain deeply mindful of how those commitments \r\nare turned into actions.\r\nSo as we approach the new post-2015 development \r\nagenda, we must ensure that, while a single-framework \r\napproach is important, it does not equate to one-size-fits-\r\nall for purposes of implementation, monitoring and \r\nevaluation. It is important that the agreed sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals and post-2015 development agenda \r\ntake into account groups like SIDS so as to ensure that \r\nthe indicators developed are also applicable to their \r\nsituations. Similarly, we want the upcoming United \r\nNations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, \r\nto be held next year in Japan; the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, to be held \r\nin Lima; and the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference, to be held in Paris, to use our Samoa \r\nPathway as an authoritative source from which to draw \r\ninspiration for their respective outcomes.\r\nI cannot resist restating what my Prime Minister \r\nsaid in his closing remarks at the SIDS Conference in \r\nApia:\r\n“I hope the Samoa Pathway will not be viewed \r\nas an end in itself to be used only as a reference point \r\nuntil the next SIDS conference. Much investment \r\nin genuine goodwill by SIDS and their partners \r\nwent into agreeing to the SAMOA Pathway as the \r\nblueprint for SIDS sustainable development for \r\nnow and the immediate future.”\r\nWe need a comprehensive review of the SIDS-\r\nspecific United Nations institutions responsive and \r\nsupportive to SIDS in our collective efforts to address \r\ntheir sustainable development aspirations in the post-\r\n2015 development agenda and beyond. We also call for \r\nthe establishment of a robust global monitoring system \r\nthat will strengthen accountability at all levels and \r\nensure an adequate and timely analysis and update of \r\nthe implementation of the Samoa Pathway.\r\nAs composer of the Conference theme song “There \r\nIs Hope”, I appeal to all Member States to help us turn \r\nSIDS island voices into global choices so that there will \r\nindeed be hope for SIDS today, tomorrow and in the \r\nfuture. Let me reminisce and admit that Samoa will \r\nnever be the same again, because we invited close to \r\n4,000 representatives to our shores, and at the end we \r\nhad to say good-bye to 4,000 genuine friends of Samoa. \r\nAn enduring momento that will live on forever with \r\nour people is the fact that when the Secretary-General \r\narrived, he was Mr. Ban Ki-moon, yet when he left \r\nhe was bestowed the Samoan princely title of Afioga \r\nTupua Ban Ki-moon.\r\n12/12 14-62672\r\nA/69/PV.51 14/11/2014\r\nTo conclude, I say to all those who made it to \r\nSamoa, our people were privileged to be the host for \r\nthe SIDS Conference. We continue to treasure the \r\nmemories of their presence in our small paradise, and \r\nit is my sincerest wish that their memories of their brief \r\nsojourn in my country be as pleasant as ours.\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 13 and its \r\nsub-item (a) and of agenda item 115.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.30 a.m.\r\n"
