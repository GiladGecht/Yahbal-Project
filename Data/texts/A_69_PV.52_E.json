"*1463039*\r\n14-63039 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 63\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/69/53 \r\nand A/69/53/Add.1)\r\nThe President: In connection with this item, I \r\nwould like to recall that the General Assembly, at its \r\n2nd plenary meeting, on 19 September 2014, decided to \r\nconsider agenda item 63 in the plenary meeting and in \r\nthe Third Committee, pursuant to resolution 65/281, of \r\n17 June 2011.\r\nI welcome His Excellency Mr. Baudelaire Ndong \r\nElla, President of the Human Rights Council, and \r\ncommend him for his leadership of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil.\r\nSince its establishment in 2006, the Council has \r\ncontinued to gain prominence as the main United \r\nNations organ dedicated to the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights, one of the three pillars of the United \r\nNations. By responding to human rights violations, \r\nthe Council is instrumental in encouraging respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for everybody, \r\neverywhere. In this regard, the Council’s active and \r\nsustained response to human rights situations around \r\nthe globe is commendable. With creative working \r\nmethods and a variety of tools, such as commissions \r\nof inquiry, special procedures and panel discussions, \r\nthe Council has assisted Member States in fulfilling \r\ntheir human rights obligations. The Council has also \r\nput the spotlight on widespread and systemic human \r\nrights violations, ensuring that complex human rights \r\nsituations remain high on the United Nations agenda.\r\nI would like to underscore the importance of the \r\nuniversal periodic review (UPR), which is now well \r\ninto its second cycle. By providing universal coverage \r\nand guaranteeing the equal treatment of States, that \r\nmechanism has become a cornerstone of the United \r\nNations human rights system. It is essential to preserve \r\nthe UPR’s founding principles, and I encourage \r\nMember States to continue cooperating with that \r\nimportant mechanism and ensuring follow-up of the \r\nrecommendations accepted during their review.\r\nThe Council has not only been prompt in \r\naddressing country-specific issues, it has also been \r\nactive in promoting the entire spectrum of human \r\nrights, including civil, political, economic, social and \r\ncultural rights and the right to development. Through \r\nits various mandates and mechanisms, the Council has \r\ngiven a voice to the most vulnerable and those most \r\nlikely to suffer discrimination and denial of their basic \r\nrights. From the rights of women and children to those \r\nof persons with disabilities, from internally displaced \r\npersons to victims of sexual violence, the Council has \r\nworked to strengthen the fundamental rights of all \r\npeople.\r\nThe work of the Human Rights Council reaffirms \r\nthe fundamental principle that every human being is \r\nentitled to a life of dignity and the full enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights. The support of the Assembly is therefore \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.52\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n52nd plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 17 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The Council \r\nwas established eight years ago — some of those here \r\nwere present in this Hall at that time — to replace the \r\nCommission on Human Rights, following the adoption, \r\non 15 March 2006, of resolution 60/251. The Assembly \r\nthereby entrusted the Human Rights Council with the \r\nmandate of\r\n“promoting universal respect for the protection of \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind and in a fair and \r\nequal manner” (resolution 60/251, para. 2).\r\nOver the years, the Council has acquired importance, \r\nrenown and credibility, particularly through its \r\nspecial procedures and universal periodic reviews. \r\nThe Council, unlike the now-defunct Commission on \r\nHuman Rights, guarantees fair and equal treatment and \r\nthe non-politicization of its discussions.\r\nOn behalf of the Human Rights Council, it is \r\nmy honour to submit the report on its activities to \r\nthe Assembly this morning. Before continuing, I \r\nwish to express my sincere congratulations to you, \r\nMr. President, on your splendid election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \r\nI welcome the coincidence, by which I mean this \r\nextraordinary meeting seemingly orchestrated by \r\nthe god of the universe to enable the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, who hails from an African \r\ncountry, to present the Human Rights Council’s report \r\nto the President of the General Assembly, who also hails \r\nfrom an African country. It is a precedent that some \r\nmay consider a sign of the times. For my part, I wish \r\nyou, Mr. President, every success during your mandate. \r\nI am convinced that your character and rich experience \r\nare undeniable assets for the success of your tenure. I \r\nam certain that the adoption of this report will also be a \r\nstep towards that success.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate the 15 States elected \r\nby the Assembly to join the 47-member Council: \r\nAlbania, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Botswana, the Congo, \r\nEl Salvador, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Latvia, the \r\nNetherlands, Nigeria, Paraguay, Portugal and Qatar.\r\nThe eighth cycle of the presidency of the Human \r\nRights Council is taking place in a difficult human rights \r\ncontext characterized by many crises and conflicts, \r\noften involving non-State actors. The Council held three \r\nregular sessions, as stipulated in the Council’s rules of \r\nprocedure, contained in the annex to Council resolution \r\n5/1. In that period, over 138 meetings were organized, \r\naveraging about 46 meetings per session, exceeding the \r\nnormal threshold of 32 meetings. Each session had a \r\nparticularly heavy programme of work, with meetings \r\nrunning all day, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., without a lunch \r\nbreak. More than 252 reports were examined under \r\nvarious agenda items. Fifty-seven interactive dialogues \r\nwere organized with the special procedures mandate \r\nholders on thematic issues and on country issues.\r\nThe Human Rights Council organized 22 high-\r\nlevel panels on current topics and various crisis \r\nsituations. Among them I note the discussions on the \r\npromotion of preventive approaches within the United \r\nNations system, the protection of the family, good \r\npractices in combating female genital mutilation, \r\nthe safety of journalists, the rights of persons with \r\ndisabilities, the rights of indigenous peoples, access \r\nto justice for children, the rights of women, the use of \r\ndrones in military antiterrorist operations, the right to \r\nprivacy in the digital age, the human rights situation \r\nin eastern Ukraine, the fight against sexual violence in \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the human \r\nrights situation in South Sudan.\r\nPursuant to the provisions of Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 16/21, the General Assembly \r\nrequested, in its resolution 65/281, that the Council \r\nhold a half-day high-level panel discussion once a year \r\non mainstreaming human rights in all United Nations \r\nagencies and funds. During its twenty-fifth regular \r\nsession, in March, the Council organized a high-level \r\npanel entitled “The protection and promotion of the \r\nhuman rights of migrants”. Among other issues, it dealt \r\nwith the loss of lives of numerous African migrants in \r\nthe area around the Italian island of Lampedusa. More \r\nthan 8,000 representatives participated in the three \r\nregular sessions, with around 130 dignitaries coming \r\nfrom various parts of the world. More than 500 parallel \r\nevents were organized on the sidelines of our work.\r\nDuring its twenty-fifth session, the Council was \r\nparticularly honoured to welcome a Head of State, His \r\n14-63039 3/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nExcellency Mr. Moncel Marzouki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia. We also hosted Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon; the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-eighth session, His Excellency Mr. John \r\nAshe; the Vice-President of the Republic of Colombia, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Angelino Garzón; and the Prime \r\nMinister of Vanuatu, His Excellency Mr. Moana \r\nCarcasses Kalosil. And those are just some examples.\r\nI would like to emphasize the effective participation \r\nof the least developed countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States in the work of the Council, which \r\ncontributes to the principle of universality. The \r\ntrust fund established by the Council to support the \r\nparticipation of least developed countries and small \r\nisland developing States allowed a dozen delegations \r\nfrom those countries to attend. Indeed, I encourage \r\nmore States to contribute to that trust fund so that in \r\nfuture the Council can continue to facilitate greater \r\nparticipation.\r\nThe Human Rights Council held three special \r\nsessions to respond urgently to certain situations where \r\nhuman rights and international humanitarian law were \r\nbeing seriously violated. At the request of Ethiopia, \r\non behalf of the Group of African States, the Council \r\nmet on 20 January to consider the serious human rights \r\nviolations in the Central African Republic linked to the \r\ncivil war and intercommunal violence in that country. \r\nFollowing that special session, the Council appointed \r\nan independent expert, Mrs. Marie-Thérèse Keita \r\nBocoum, to follow up on the situation of human rights \r\nand to support the stabilization and pacification efforts \r\nof the transition authorities in the Central African \r\nRepublic.\r\nOn 23 July, the Council met at the request of \r\nPakistan, on behalf of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation and the Group of Arab States, on the \r\nsituation of human rights violations and violence in the \r\nPalestinian territories occupied since 1967, including \r\nEast Jerusalem and Gaza. The Council decided to appoint \r\na commission of inquiry tasked with investigating \r\nallegations of serious human rights violations and \r\ninternational humanitarian law perpetrated by all \r\nparties in the occupied Palestinian territories, including \r\nEast Jerusalem and Gaza. In spite of certain difficulties, \r\nI was able to appoint the members of the commission \r\nof inquiry, which began its preliminary investigations \r\nunder the chairmanship of Professor Schabas. The three \r\nmembers of the commission — Mr. Schabas of Canada, \r\nMr. Diène of Senegal and former judge Ms. Mary Davis \r\nof the United States of America — visited me some \r\ndays ago and provided a first update of their mission.\r\nOn 1 September, the Council held a special session \r\non the situation of human rights in Iraq linked to the \r\nviolations and abuses perpetrated by the terrorist group \r\nknown as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. The \r\nCouncil faced a problem that is both special and new \r\nconcerning violence, crimes and serious violations of \r\nhuman rights perpetrated by a non-State actor. It decided \r\nto send, on an urgent basis, a mission of inquiry from \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights to shed light on the situation in the \r\nnorth of Iraq.\r\nRegarding the universal periodic review, the Council \r\nadopted the reports of the 57 countries considered this \r\nyear at the beginning of the second cycle. Indeed, at \r\nits eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth sessions, the \r\nWorking Group on on the Universal Periodic Review \r\nreviewed the situation of human rights in 15 African \r\ncountries, 15 Asian countries, 10 Latin American \r\ncountries, five Western European countries, six Eastern \r\nEuropean countries and three Pacific countries. There \r\nwere 5,040 recommendations made, of which 3,931 were \r\naccepted and 831 simply noted. Since the beginning \r\nof the second cycle of the universal periodic review, \r\nmore than 20,000 recommendations have been made, of \r\nwhich more than 16,000 were accepted and under 4,000 \r\nsimply noted. I wish to reassure the Assembly that my \r\npresentation is not intended to be a mathematics course. \r\nI am just trying to demonstrate the workload of the \r\nCouncil in the framework of that important mechanism.\r\nThe participation of reviewed countries was \r\n100 per cent, and delegations were represented at \r\nleast at the ministerial level. As you have emphasized, \r\nMr. President, that mechanism is gaining importance \r\nand credibility and henceforth will constitute an \r\nessential pillar of the system for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights.\r\nRegarding the decisions and resolutions of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, the cycle just finished was \r\nonce again productive. The Council adopted 114 texts, \r\nincluding 106 resolutions, six presidential statements \r\nand two decisions. Sixty-five per cent of those decisions \r\nand resolutions were adopted by consensus and 35 by \r\nvote. The current thematic subjects linked to human \r\nrights were dealt with in resolutions concerning the \r\nuse of remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones in the \r\nframework of counter-terrorism operations, protection \r\nof human rights defenders in the framework of peaceful \r\n4/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nprotests, the promotion of the right to a private life \r\nin the digital age, the protection of the family, the \r\nestablishment of an intergovernmental working \r\ngroup with a mandate to elaborate a legally binding \r\ninternational instrument for multinational corporations, \r\nviolence and discrimination against persons based on \r\ntheir sexual and gender orientation, and abolition of the \r\ndeath penalty.\r\nThe Council renewed the appointments of special \r\nprocedures mandate-holders. The decisions on \r\nappointments had to do with several special rapporteurs, \r\nincluding the Special Rapporteur on the situation of \r\nhuman rights defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nsituation of human rights in the Palestinian territories \r\noccupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion and protection \r\nof the right to freedom of opinion and expression, and \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the right to health. The large \r\nnumber of mandate-holders appointed — 31 out of the \r\n53 existing ones — made the task quite difficult. In \r\norder for the advisory group and I to be able to submit \r\ndraft decisions that are sufficiently acceptable to the \r\nCouncil, it would be desirable to consider the possibility \r\nof having a more appropriate periodic appointment \r\nprocess. Moreover, new thematic mandates were \r\nestablished, including the Special Rapporteur on the \r\nrights of persons with disabilities and the Special \r\nRapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures on the enjoyment of human rights.\r\nAs I stated at the beginning of my presentation, \r\nthe Council had recourse to the establishment of \r\ncomplementary mechanisms to provide emergency \r\nresponses to situations of serious violations of human \r\nrights. That was the case regarding the decision to \r\nestablish a commission of inquiry on serious violations \r\nof human rights and international humanitarian law \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories following the \r\nmilitary operations in the Gaza Strip, and a commission \r\nof inquiry to investigate human rights violations in \r\nEritrea. That also pertained to the decision to deploy \r\na team of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nto investigate the situation of human rights violations \r\nin Iraq linked to abuses and violence of the so-\r\ncalled Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and to the \r\nestablishment of a structure of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner to follow the human rights situation in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and in Sri \r\nLanka.\r\nRegarding the country situations, during its three \r\nregular sessions the Council carefully followed the \r\nsituation of human rights in Eritrea, in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Belarus, Myanmar, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran and the Syrian Arab Republic \r\nunder item 4 of its agenda. Other country situations \r\nwere also taken up under agenda item 2, mainly the \r\nsituations in Iraq and in Sri Lanka. Along the same \r\nlines, the Council renewed the mandate of a certain \r\nnumber of independent experts on the human rights \r\nsituation in countries benefiting from technical \r\ncooperation and technical assistance programmes to \r\nstrengthen capacities in human rights under item 10. \r\nThat concerns Mali, the Sudan, the Central African \r\nRepublic, Somalia, Yemen and Côte d’Ivoire. The \r\nCouncil supported the decision to renew the mandate \r\nof the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human \r\nrights in Cambodia and to provide follow-up on the \r\nhuman rights situations in Libya, Guinea, South Sudan, \r\nUkraine and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nSome months ago, we were pleased to witness \r\nan unprecedented international mobilization against \r\nthe terrorist Islamist group Boko Haram, following \r\nthe kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls in the north-east of \r\nNigeria, under the slogan Bring Back Our Girls.\r\nAnother even more devastating and very deadly \r\nthreat, the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, is of concern \r\nto all of us today. The loss of human life since the \r\nbeginning of the epidemic demonstrates that it is a \r\nthreat to both human life and the human condition. At \r\nits twenty-seventh session, the Human Rights Council \r\nadopted a presidential statement on the Ebola virus \r\nepidemic, thereby demonstrating its ability to respond \r\non an emergency basis to the seriousness of that \r\nsituation. The Council sought to encourage workers, \r\nagencies and non-governmental organizations working \r\nin the humanitarian sphere in the fight against the \r\nepidemic.\r\nThe Council has also been worried for some time \r\nnow about accessibility to its work and documents by \r\npersons with disabilities. It therefore created a special \r\ntask force that is making several specific improvements, \r\nin particular by providing a guide on accessibility to \r\nthe Council for persons with disabilities and reserving \r\nseats for individuals with disabilities in the Council’s \r\nmeeting room. Each Council meeting, aside from the \r\nannual debate on persons with disabilities, has also \r\nbeen made accessible to persons with disabilities, with \r\n14-63039 5/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\ninternational sign language, subtitling and the option of \r\nprinting statements in Braille upon request.\r\nOn the agenda item concerning financial and \r\nbudgetary issues, allow me to highlight the fact that the \r\n114 documents adopted by the Human Rights Council \r\nduring its regular and special sessions account for \r\nabout $30 million. That is about 60 to 75 per cent more \r\nthan the budget for 2013. As the Assembly knows, the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights devotes more than half of its resources \r\nto mandates from the Council and has not had enough \r\nresources for several years now.\r\nHowever, the number of new mandates on country-\r\nspecific and thematic items, combined with the \r\nactivities requested by Member States, has tripled over \r\nthe past three years. This is demonstrated by the number \r\nof decisions and resolutions adopted by the Council, \r\nwhich went from 60 in 2006 to 114 today, the number \r\nof reports considered and round tables and interactive \r\ndebates held, and the record number of participants \r\nand dignitaries. I would like to call the attention of the \r\nAssembly to the need to provide additional resources to \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights so as to allow the Council to carry \r\nout its mandate effectively and respond to emergency \r\nsituations in every region of the world.\r\nThe Human Rights Council is now a victim of its \r\nown success. The number of resolutions and decisions, \r\nhigh-level panels and interactive dialogues is constantly \r\nincreasing. The workload has increased and has \r\nbecome a matter of concern for the Council’s various \r\nstakeholders. During the twenty-seventh session, the \r\nBureau of the Council, with the help of the secretariat, \r\nwas forced to make certain adjustments so as to \r\naccommodate the large workload. Therefore the time \r\nallotted to statements was reduced for Member States \r\nand observers speaking during round-table discussions \r\nand interactive debates, as well as for special procedures \r\nmandate-holders presenting reports.\r\nOther solutions to improve the working methods of \r\nthe Council could be considered without undermining \r\nthe current balance and mass participation of civil \r\nsociety representatives. The participation of civil \r\nsociety in the activities of the Council should be \r\nfacilitated and strengthened, as it helps preserve the \r\ncredibility and neutrality of the Human Rights Council \r\nwithin the United Nations system. Resolution 24/24, on \r\ncooperation with the United Nations, its representatives \r\nand mechanisms in the area of human rights — the \r\nadoption of which had been deferred by my predecessor \r\nat the time of the presentation of the report last \r\nyear — from this point of view merits the support of \r\nthis Assembly. It would be desirable if the elements \r\nthat had blocked the adoption of that resolution could \r\nbe resolved in a definitive manner at the current session \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nWe should consider updating the working methods \r\nof the Council so as to take on board the contingencies \r\nand new situations. Some delegations would indeed like \r\nto encourage such an initiative in Geneva so as to ensure \r\nthat it is resolved in 2016, as the most recent update \r\ntook place in 2011. Several aspects could be considered, \r\nin particular the Council’s agenda, the number of \r\nresolutions, the number of panels, the functioning of \r\nsome groups linked to the activities of the Council, \r\nthe role of special procedures, and the participation \r\nof non-governmental organizations in the work of the \r\nCouncil and treaty bodies.\r\nOn the other hand, there is a need to continue the \r\ntrend of integrating the issue of human rights into the \r\nagencies and programmes of the United Nations system. \r\nHuman rights should in that respect be given proper \r\npriority in the discussions under way on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Economic, cultural and social \r\nrights, including the right to development, should be \r\nconsidered on equal footing with cultural and political \r\nrights.\r\nDuring my presidency, I have participated in \r\nover 1,000 activities, which have been divided among \r\nmeetings and hearings with high-level officials \r\nand bilateral consultations with Member States, \r\nrepresentatives of international and domestic human \r\nrights institutions, special procedures mandate holders \r\nand human rights advocates. I took the initiative to \r\nvisit New York after every session of the Council so \r\nas to exchange views with all stakeholders and update \r\nthem on the Council’s work. Given the international \r\nsituation and the Council’s composition, I understand \r\nthat this tenure has been the most difficult since the \r\nestablishment of the Council in 2006. I would also \r\nlike to emphasize that every day the Council seems \r\nthreatened by a risk of politicization and polarization in \r\nits debates, and I have very often encouraged dialogue \r\nand cooperation.\r\nI would like to thank all delegations for their \r\nsupport and the confidence they have placed in Gabon. \r\nUnder the leadership of His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo \r\nOndimba, President of the Republic and Head of State, \r\n6/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nthe country has placed peace, human rights and the \r\npeople’s well-being at the heart of its development \r\nstrategy, which is aimed at lifting the country to the \r\nstatus of an emerging country by 2025.\r\nWe must consolidate the current credibility and \r\nauthority of the Council, always being mindful of the \r\nreasons that the Commission on Human Rights ceased \r\nto exist. For my part, this mandate has reinforced \r\nmy belief that now more than ever we need strong \r\ninstitutions such as the Council to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights across the globe.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the European \r\nUnion.\r\nMr. Mayr-Harting (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). \r\nThe candidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania; the \r\ncountry of the Stabilization and Association Process \r\nand potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina; as \r\nwell as Ukraine and Georgia, align themselves with \r\nthis statement.\r\nThe European Union would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nBaudelaire Ndong Ella, for presenting the Council’s \r\nninth annual report to the General Assembly (A/69/53). \r\nWe also appreciate the opportunity to hold an interactive \r\ndialogue with the Human Rights Council President \r\nat the Third Committee, and I would add that we are \r\nparticularly grateful for the dialogue, here during \r\nhis mandate, with major groups in the Organization, \r\nincluding ours. In the interests of time, I will abridge \r\nmy statement a little bit and ask delegations to look at \r\nthe written version for the full text.\r\nThe European Union remains a strong supporter \r\nof the Human Rights Council, a position held since \r\nits establishment. The Council, as the main United \r\nNations body devoted purely to the promotion and \r\nprotection of all human rights, has strengthened the \r\nability of the United Nations to ensure that all persons \r\nenjoy their human rights. We attach great importance to \r\nboth the credibility and the effectiveness of the Council \r\nand will continue to make every effort to ensure that \r\nit is able to address situations of violations of human \r\nrights, including gross and systematic violations, to \r\nrespond promptly to human rights emergencies, and \r\nalso to improve human rights standards and their \r\nimplementation worldwide through systematic work \r\non various thematic issues. In that context, we strongly \r\noppose any attempts to undermine the institutional \r\nposition of the Council within the system of the United \r\nNations.\r\nIn that connection, the European Union is pleased to \r\nnote that the Human Rights Council has maintained its \r\nleadership in addressing human rights situations. The \r\nCouncil’s ongoing response to the crisis in the Syrian \r\nArab Republic remains highly important, including \r\nby extending through to its twenty-eighth session \r\nthe mandate of the Commission of Inquiry, currently \r\nthe only international investigative mechanism on \r\nhuman rights violations and abuses in the country. \r\nThe Council has also demonstrated its commitment \r\nto provide technical assistance and capacity-building \r\nto the Governments of Afghanistan, Cambodia, the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Mali, Somalia, \r\nthe Sudan and Yemen with a view to promoting human \r\nrights, and we welcome the continued support that has \r\nbeen rendered to the Central African Republic, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Libya, the Republic of Guinea and South \r\nSudan. The European Union hopes that the Council will \r\ncontinue to closely monitor situations where technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building can make a difference \r\nand that it will take action where necessary.\r\nOn 21 October, the General Assembly elected \r\n15 new members to the Human Rights Council. Serving \r\nas a Council member entails important responsibilities; \r\nresolution 60/251 provides in paragraph 9 that “members \r\nelected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards \r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights”. We \r\nencourage all to pay full attention to the human rights \r\nrecords and human rights commitments of States \r\nthroughout their membership.\r\nWe highly value the work of the special procedures \r\nand are firmly convinced that they play a crucial role in \r\nadvancing the human rights agenda. All States members \r\nof the European Union have extended a standing \r\ninvitation to the special procedures, and the EU calls \r\nupon all United Nations Members to do likewise and \r\nto actively cooperate with those procedures. In order \r\nto allow special procedures to fully carry out their \r\nmandates, it is crucial that they be able to independently \r\nassess and draw the Council’s attention to human rights \r\nsituations and issues. The European Union welcomes \r\nthe growing participation of mandate-holders in the \r\nCouncil.\r\n14-63039 7/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nGiven the situation in the countries concerned, the \r\nEuropean Union welcomes the extension of the country-\r\nspecific mandates of the Special Rapporteurs on the \r\nsituation of human rights in Belarus, Eritrea, Myanmar, \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, as well as the appointment of the Independent \r\nExpert on the situation of human rights in Somalia. We \r\nalso welcome the establishment of the new mandate of the \r\nIndependent Expert on capacity-building and technical \r\ncooperation with Côte d’Ivoire and the extension of the \r\nmandates of the Independent Experts on the situation \r\nof human rights in the Central African Republic, Haiti, \r\nMali and the Sudan. We also support the establishment \r\nof a commission of inquiry on the situation of human \r\nrights in Eritrea and stand fully behind the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) investigation in Sri Lanka, which is currently \r\nunder way. Finally, we also encourage cooperation \r\nwith the Commission of Inquiry set to investigate all \r\nviolations and abuses of international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem.\r\nThematic special procedures play an equally \r\nimportant role, through their research, country-\r\nspecific visits and valuable contribution to the better \r\nunderstanding of the content of specific human \r\nrights and their contribution to the enhancement and \r\nrealization of human rights standards. Among the many \r\nthematic special procedures, the European Union would \r\nlike to highlight the mandate of the Special Rapporteur \r\non freedom of religion or belief, who plays an active \r\nrole in identifying existing and emerging obstacles to \r\nthe enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or \r\nbelief and in presenting recommendations to overcome \r\nsuch obstacles.\r\nThe European Union remains strongly committed \r\nto the universal periodic review (UPR), a truly \r\nuniversal and unique mechanism within the United \r\nNations, which seeks to address all human rights and is \r\napplicable to all States Members of the United Nations \r\nwithout distinction or discrimination and continues to \r\ncontribute to the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms on the ground. \r\nPreserving the universality of the UPR process is of \r\nparamount importance, and in that regard the Council \r\nhas been successful. Ultimately, the quality of the review \r\nrecommendations and the commitment to implement \r\nthem are key to the outcome of the process. Therefore, \r\nwe would like to refer to the Council President’s letter \r\nof 18 September 2013 and stress that the equal treatment \r\nof all countries is an underlying element of the UPR \r\nmechanism and needs to be maintained throughout \r\neach cycle.\r\nThe European Union wishes in particular to \r\nhighlight and welcome the following important \r\ndevelopments during the reporting period.\r\nFirst, the Council rendered necessary attention to \r\nthe safety of journalists, holding a panel discussion on \r\nthe subject.\r\nSecondly, the enjoyment of human rights by women \r\nand girls has continued to figure as a major theme \r\non the Human Rights Council’s agenda during the \r\nperiod under review. The Council held another panel \r\ndiscussion on preventing and eliminating child, early \r\nand forced marriage, as well as on the identification of \r\ngood practices in combating female genital mutilation.\r\nThirdly, the Council addressed the issue of the \r\ndeath penalty through a high-level panel discussion as \r\nwell as initiatives.\r\nFourthly, the Council continued its crucial work \r\non the rights of the child, with a full-day annual panel \r\ndiscussion, presented jointly by the European Union \r\nand the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nand dedicated to access to justice for children. The \r\nCouncil also adopted a resolution on the topic.\r\nFifthly, the Council also held a panel discussion \r\non the importance of the promotion and protection \r\nof civil society space, focusing on the promotion of a \r\nconstructive, interactive partnership between States \r\nand civil society and underlining the important role of \r\ncivil society, including human rights defenders, in the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights.\r\nThe European Union reiterates its strongest \r\ncondemnation of acts involving reprisals against \r\nand intimidation of civil society representatives \r\nwho attend Human Rights Council meetings and \r\ncooperate with human rights mechanisms and the \r\nOHCHR. Contributions by civil society organizations \r\nand national human rights institutions are extremely \r\nvaluable to the work of the Council. Their ability to \r\ninteract with the Council must be preserved.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate our ongoing \r\ncommitment to contributing to the work of the Human \r\nRights Council and to further strengthening its role in \r\nthe development of international human rights law. We \r\nwill continue to systematically uphold and ensure the \r\n8/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nimplementation of existing international norms and \r\nstandards, to strongly advocate for the universality \r\nof human rights and to promote the observance by all \r\nStates of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nMr. Alibrahim (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Today \r\nthe General Assembly is considering one of the most \r\nimportant items on its agenda. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to thank the Human Rights Council for its annual \r\nreport, contained in documents A/69/53 and A/69/53/\r\nAdd.1, which summarizes the work of the Council \r\nin promoting human rights internationally and its \r\ncontinuing endeavour to uphold and defend them.\r\nThe report discusses many issues relating to human \r\nrights and their promotion, focusing on the role of the \r\nrelevant international human rights institutions and \r\ntheir efforts to enhance cooperation of every kind with \r\nvarious countries around the world. It also touches on \r\nmany important issues, including human trafficking, \r\nthe rights of persons with disabilities and the need to \r\nstrengthen efforts aimed at eliminating intolerance, \r\nextremism, discrimination and violence against women \r\nin any form. The report includes the outcomes of the \r\nuniversal periodic review for many countries, and in \r\nthat regard, we would like to emphasize the fact that \r\nthe full, practical implementation of human rights is \r\nthe responsibility of the States concerned and requires \r\nconcerted effort on the part of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe concept of human rights is directly linked to \r\nthe achievement of development goals, since prosperity \r\nfor nations and peoples is measured in part by their \r\ncommitment to the principles of human rights. The \r\nCharter of the United Nations also urges us to uphold \r\nhuman rights and basic freedoms. In that context, I would \r\nlike to affirm that the State of Kuwait is committed to \r\nobserving the criteria and standards for human rights. \r\nOur Constitution reflects human rights agreements, \r\ninstruments and conventions. We have established \r\nrights such as the right to freedom of expression and \r\nthe right to life. Article 7 of our Constitution stipulates \r\nthat freedom, equality and justice are the pillars of our \r\nsociety, as are cooperation and harmony among our \r\ncitizens.\r\nSince the submission in 2010 of its first report \r\nto the universal periodic review mechanism, Kuwait \r\nhas worked hard to implement the outcomes of that \r\nexercise. We have formed a committee to coordinate \r\nnational efforts in implementing voluntary pledges \r\nand country-specific recommendations. Those efforts \r\nhave been translated into a draft bill for establishing an \r\noffice for human rights, based on the Paris Principles on \r\nthe status of national human rights institutions. Kuwait \r\nwill present its second national report to the universal \r\nperiodic review in January 2015.\r\nRegarding international conventions, we recently \r\nratified the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities. We have also established national \r\nmechanisms designed to strengthen human rights, \r\nincluding a commission within the National Assembly \r\nof Kuwait for the defence of human rights. We have \r\nalso established national authorities for combating \r\ncorruption and supervising the workforces in various \r\nsectors.\r\nKuwait provides a great deal of humanitarian \r\nassistance through non-governmental organizations, \r\nnational and international, including the United \r\nNations Human Rights Council. We believe that it is \r\nimportant to strengthen peace, security and respect for \r\nhuman rights around the world. To that end, we hosted \r\nthe first and second donor conferences in support \r\nof humanitarian work in Syria, aimed at easing the \r\nsuffering of the brotherly people of that country. In that \r\nregard, we have sponsored the draft resolution in the \r\nThird Committee on the situation of human rights in \r\nSyria, which strongly condemns the grave, widespread \r\nviolations there of international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights law.\r\nIn the context of this discussion of human rights and \r\nthe importance of respecting individuals’ humanity, we \r\nstrongly condemn Israel’s continued and oppressive \r\npolicies and practices, which continue to violate the \r\nbasic principles with regard to the human rights of \r\nthe unarmed Palestinian people living in the occupied \r\nterritories. We call on the international community \r\nto continue to shoulder its responsibilities by forcing \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, to comply with the \r\nrelevant resolutions on international legitimacy, to end \r\nits aggressive and expansionist policies, and to abide \r\nby international law and the principles of human rights.\r\nIn conclusion, Kuwait would like to affirm its \r\nrespect for all international human rights conventions \r\nand instruments. We also encourage all efforts to \r\nuphold human rights. We believe that it is essential to \r\nwork to cooperate in that area in order to achieve the \r\ngoal that we all desire, which is the advancement and \r\nprosperity of our peoples and nations.\r\n14-63039 9/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland would like to thank the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for his report (A/69/53).\r\nCivil society’s participation in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations is fundamental and particularly crucial \r\nto the functioning of the Human Rights Council. \r\nSwitzerland is concerned, however, about the growing \r\nnumber of instances of intimidation and reprisals against \r\nmembers of civil society while they exercise their \r\nfundamental rights in providing first-hand information \r\nto the representatives of United Nations mechanisms. \r\nWhile protecting such people is itself a priority, it \r\nshould be even more so considering that civil society’s \r\nparticipation at every level, international, national or \r\nlocal, is essential to enabling United Nations organs to \r\nfulfil their mandates. Switzerland calls on all Member \r\nStates to work together to deal with that worrisome \r\ndevelopment in order to put an end to reprisals against \r\nthose key partners of the United Nations system.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the efforts to improve the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s working methods launched \r\nunder the current President’s leadership, for example \r\nby putting strict limits on delegations’ speaking time \r\nduring interactive dialogues. We note with regret, \r\nhowever, that on two occasions the nomination of \r\nspecial procedures mandate-holders of the Council \r\nhad to be postponed. The necessity of improving the \r\nCouncil’s working methods is a direct result of the major \r\nincrease in the Council’s activity during its sessions, \r\nwhether owing to the creation of new mandates or \r\nthe launch of new initiatives. While positive in itself, \r\nthat development nonetheless results in problems with \r\nresources, particularly with regard to financing such \r\nactivities. The fact is that, despite the fact that human \r\nrights constitutes one of the three basic pillars of \r\nthe United Nations, it receives only 3 per cent of the \r\nOrganization’s regular budget.\r\nIt was for that reason that Switzerland, together with \r\nMexico, Morocco, Norway and Turkey and on behalf \r\nof 50 other States, addressed a letter to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral dated 15 July expressing its concern about \r\nthe chronic underfunding of the human rights pillar of \r\nthe United Nations. The outline of the draft budget for \r\nthe 2016-2017 biennium is due to be introduced in the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s Fifth Committee on Wednesday. In \r\nthat context, Switzerland will maintain its commitment \r\nto improving the financing of the activities of the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights through \r\nthe regular budget.\r\nSwitzerland is pleased to note that during its \r\ncurrent presidency, the Council has done justice \r\nto one of the most important duties of its mandate, \r\nnamely, addressing situations in the world where the \r\nworst violations of human rights are taking place. We \r\nwelcome the fact that under the current presidency the \r\ncrises in the Central African Republic, the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and Iraq have been examined in \r\nspecial sessions and that the tragic situations in Syria \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea have \r\nalso come under the Council’s scrutiny.\r\nFinally, I would like to assure the President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council of Switzerland’s full \r\ncommitment to the work of the institutions based in \r\nGeneva, particularly the Human Rights Council, in \r\ntheir ongoing efforts to carry out their essential tasks \r\nof protecting and promoting human rights.\r\nMr. Barriga (Liechtenstein): We welcome the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Mr. Baudelaire \r\nNdong Ella, and thank him for presenting the Council’s \r\nreport today (A/69/53). The report illustrates once \r\nagain the Council’s relevance and its ability to address \r\nemerging human rights challenges. The universal \r\nperiodic review (UPR) also continues to be a very \r\nvaluable mechanism, and we are pleased to see that \r\nits universal nature has been safeguarded. The added \r\nvalue of the UPR lies, in particular, in the effective \r\nfollow-up and implementation of recommendations that \r\nStates accept in their dialogues with their peers. The \r\ncoming years will therefore be decisive for proving the \r\nmechanism’s effectiveness.\r\nAt the time of his election, the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council emphasized his support for \r\nefforts aimed at protecting people who have cooperated \r\nwith human rights bodies. This is a central challenge \r\nfor the United Nations human rights machinery, and we \r\ntherefore fully supported the adoption of Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 24/24 last year on ending reprisals \r\nagainst individuals or groups cooperating with the United \r\nNations. When human rights defenders face retaliation \r\nfor speaking up, not only are their individual rights \r\nviolated, but the human rights mechanisms themselves \r\nare under attack. It is unfortunate that that resolution \r\nstill awaits implementation pending action in the Third \r\nCommittee, which is contrary to the understanding \r\nestablished of the institutional relationship between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. \r\nMr. President, we look forward to your leadership in \r\nthat respect.\r\n10/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nIn Human Rights Council resolution 27/31, on civil \r\nsociety space, the Council underlined the significance \r\nof a safe and enabling environment for civil society and \r\nin particular for persons belonging to minorities and \r\nvulnerable groups. We commend the Council on that \r\nimportant decision and are particularly pleased that it \r\nwas adopted by consensus. The resolution promotes \r\nfundamental freedoms that are very important for the \r\nwork of the Council and the United Nations in general. \r\nLiechtenstein therefore strongly supports it and hopes \r\nthat it will be implemented shortly.\r\nAn increasingly important tool of the Human \r\nRights Council are the commissions of inquiry that it \r\nhas established in connection with some of the most \r\nserious human rights crises, including those in Syria \r\nand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. The \r\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry on \r\nthe Syrian Arab Republic has carried out valuable work \r\nin gathering evidence of mass atrocities. Regrettably, \r\nit has not been able to galvanize the political action \r\nnecessary to put an end to those atrocities — quite the \r\ncontrary, relevant efforts were stymied in the Security \r\nCouncil earlier this year by a double veto.\r\nWe believe therefore that the Commission should \r\nfocus more strongly on gathering and preserving \r\ninformation in such a way that it can be used in a \r\ncourt at a later stage. Those who have perpetrated the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law must not \r\nbe able to run out the clock on justice. Liechtenstein \r\ncontinues to believe that the International Criminal \r\nCourt would be the appropriate institution to deal with \r\nthe situation in Syria. At the same time, complementary \r\naccountability tracks will be necessary, owing to the \r\nsheer scale of the crimes committed and the number \r\nof perpetrators involved. We must therefore continue \r\nexploring all viable options to ensure accountability for \r\nthose crimes.\r\nThe Council has also expressed itself again on \r\nthe right to privacy, an issue that is also high on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly. The digital era has \r\nallowed States to pursue law enforcement in a manner \r\nthat greatly challenges the right to privacy. We believe \r\nthat it is high time that we discuss surveillance \r\npractices — both at the individual level and on a larger \r\nscale — from a human rights perspective. In doing so, \r\nwe must preserve the spirit of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights and the International Covenant \r\non Civil and Political Rights. Fighting all forms of \r\ncrime, including terrorism and transnational organized \r\ncrime, are, of course, legitimate aims that may justify \r\nsurveillance.\r\nBut just because electronic surveillance has \r\nbecome an easy tool, States must not become \r\ncomplacent in making the sometimes difficult call \r\nas to whether the value produced by the surveillance \r\nwould be proportionate to the negative effect caused \r\nby the interference with privacy. Mass surveillance \r\ncertainly seems almost impossible to justify from that \r\nperspective. That and many other complex questions \r\nregarding the right to privacy in the digital age require \r\nfurther discussion and study, which is why we support \r\nthe establishment of a special procedure on that topic.\r\nFinally, Liechtenstein notes with deep concern \r\nthe underresourcing of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). That \r\nissue is of obvious concern for the work of Human \r\nRights Council, because a considerable amount of the \r\nvery limited regular budget resources allocated to the \r\nOffice is spent on servicing the Council and activities \r\nattached to it. In a letter signed by Liechtenstein and \r\n54 other Member States in July 2014 and addressed to \r\nthe Secretary-General, we emphasized that the United \r\nNations regular budget for the OHCHR should at least \r\ncover all costs of the activities mandated by the Human \r\nRights Council. Sufficient funding of the human rights \r\npillar of the United Nations is not only crucial for the \r\nHuman Rights Council, it is essential for the whole of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I would like to welcome the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, my colleague, \r\nAmbassador Baudelaire Ndong Ella. I can assure the \r\nAssembly that we are determined to continue our \r\nconstructive cooperation with him in order to ensure \r\nthe protection of human rights in all Member States in \r\na fair and equitable manner and in accordance with the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s mandate. We intend to do so \r\nwithout any of the politicized and unbalanced measures \r\nor double standards that have led to the failure of many \r\nof the actions undertaken in New York and Geneva.\r\nWe have taken note of the Council’s report (A/69/53) \r\nwith a great deal of interest. We have also made \r\nourselves familiar with their contents and we have taken \r\nnote of the many important issues to which the Council \r\nhas referred, in particular the human rights violations \r\nthat have occurred in the occupied Arab territory of the \r\nSyrian Golan and the Palestinian territory. Forty-six \r\nyears after the beginning of the unjust Israeli occupation \r\n14-63039 11/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nin the Syrian Golan and despite the demands voiced by \r\nthe Human Rights Council that Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, implement the resolutions of all United Nations \r\nbodies and agencies, Israel continues to challenge \r\nMember States by refusing to implement the provisions \r\nof those resolutions. There have been dozens of United \r\nNations resolutions on that matter, as the Assembly \r\nis well aware. Israeli perpetrators of war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity enjoy full impunity and are \r\nnot subject to any accountability, sanctions or penalties \r\nwhatsoever for their crimes. Israeli leaders are not \r\nbeing held to account or prosecuted. They blatantly \r\ndisregard all the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the rules of international law, including \r\nthe Hague Conventions of 1907, as well as the Geneva \r\nConventions of 1949.\r\nUnfortunately, a group of Member States with great \r\ninfluence in this international Organization continues \r\nto try to transform the Human Rights Council into a \r\nprivate domain that serves specific non-humanitarian \r\npolitical agendas. That runs counter to the spirit under \r\nwhich the Human Rights Council was created and to its \r\nmandate. We saw that very clearly with the adoption of \r\na number of resolutions that had political dimensions \r\nand objectives.\r\nThe Human Rights Council condemns human rights \r\nviolations in some countries, but it does not condemn \r\nthe same violations in others. Furthermore, the Council \r\nremains silent on some mechanisms that deal with \r\nhuman rights situations and violations in a racist, \r\nethnically biased and xenophobic way, discriminating \r\nagainst indigenous people and foreign migrants. \r\nForeign migrants and workers, detainees and refugees \r\nare treated inhumanely in certain countries. Certain \r\ncountries have even carried out military invasions \r\nof other States Members of the Organization. There \r\nare militias, agents, ignorant people and extremists, \r\nas well as a whole range of groups, that f lout the \r\nright to development by adopting unilateral coercive \r\neconomic measures against developing countries and \r\nby sponsoring terrorism. The list is long.\r\nThe Syrian Government has offered a full range of \r\ncooperative measures with United Nations mechanisms \r\nin order to put an end to the national crisis in the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic in its political and humanitarian \r\ndimensions. We regret that the Human Rights Council \r\nhas not sent any positive signals with respect to the \r\nSyrian Government’s great efforts to cooperate with \r\nUnited Nations entities, or acknowledging that the \r\nSyrian Government has assumed its responsibility to \r\nact in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law. My Government has assumed its \r\nresponsibilities with respect to those various groups \r\nand has taken measures to protect the country from \r\nterrorists, terrorism and chaos.\r\nYet we see that States members of the Council, \r\nincluding whole blocs, continue unrelentingly to seek to \r\nundermine other countries, especially with respect to the \r\npolitical and humanitarian situation, and to perpetuate \r\nthe shedding of Syrian blood. My country is facing a \r\nvery difficult humanitarian situation, and that bloc of \r\ncountries is determined to adopt a series of unilateral \r\nand politicized resolutions that will adversely impact my \r\ncountry and condemn its Government. They are trying \r\nto force my country to surrender its sovereign rights \r\nover its territory through a campaign of colonialism \r\nand ethnic cleansing. Through that campaign, Israel \r\nis also trying to divide the countries of the region by \r\nexploiting religious, ethnic and sectarian differences, \r\namong others. That runs counter to the principles of \r\nmodern States and reflects a weak and vulnerable \r\nposition based on ethnic cleansing, discrimination and \r\nnon-peaceful coexistence. It represents a trend through \r\nwhich international human rights law and international \r\nhumanitarian law are f louted.\r\nAgain, the Council has adopted biased and \r\npoliticized resolutions against my country, Syria. My \r\ncountry therefore believes that such resolutions, which \r\nare introduced in the Council every few months, do not \r\ngive other States a chance to understand what is really \r\nhappening in Syria. Sometimes the sponsors of such \r\nresolutions do not take such issues as terrorism into \r\naccount. The Syrian Government and its people play a \r\nkey regional role.\r\nThe resolutions do not reflect my country’s reality. \r\nThey deny the existence and presence of terrorist \r\nand extremist groups in Syria. The international \r\ncommunity is closing its eyes to the gruesome scenes \r\nand assassinations perpetrated in Syria by the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the Al-Nusra Front \r\nand groups linked to Al-Qaida. Those entities refuse to \r\nrecognize that my country’s natural resources, including \r\npetroleum, fuel and other resources, are being sold in \r\nEurope by Turkish intermediaries, in violation of the \r\nprovisions of presidential statement S/PRST/2014/14, \r\nof July 2014, as well as Security Council resolutions \r\n2170 (2014) and 2178 (2014). There is such an influx of \r\nterrorists into Syria from neighbouring countries that \r\n12/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nthose groups are now spreading to other States in the \r\nregion, threatening all of them and the rest of the world.\r\nAssistant Secretary-General  Toyberg-Frandzen \r\nreferred to that situation in his 17 November briefing \r\nto the Security Council on the situation in the Middle \r\nEast (see S/PV.7312). He described the members of the \r\nAl-Nusra Front and its activities along the separation \r\nline in the Syrian Golan as belonging to the Syrian armed \r\nopposition. The Al-Nusra Front is a terrorist group. All \r\nthe elements to which the Assistant-Secretary-General \r\nreferred are led by a Jordanian terrorist who kidnapped \r\npersonnel from the Fiji unit serving with the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon, took photographs \r\nwith them and identified himself.\r\nHow is it possible for opposition elements that are \r\nled by a Jordanian to be Syrian? That is the result of \r\nfunds arriving every day from other countries, such \r\nas Qatar. Every day, reference is made to elements of \r\nthe Syrian armed opposition, which means that there \r\nis an error in the Organization’s approach. It is an \r\ninaccurate interpretation of the situation in the Syrian \r\nArab Republic. Today, more than three years after the \r\nterrorist incursion in Syria, we have seen a number \r\nof draft reports introduced against my country. The \r\ndanger of terrorism has spread to the countries of the \r\nregion and around the world. The presence of terrorist \r\ngroups in Syria has finally been recognized in the most \r\nrecent resolution.\r\nThe independent international commission of \r\ninquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic lacks credibility, \r\nbecause it is subjective and totally biased. It supports \r\nthe agenda of a handful of wealthy countries that \r\nbelong to a certain group, which means that the \r\nCommission has changed its position. The Commission \r\nacknowledged the existence of terrorist elements in the \r\ncountry. However, some countries refuse to recognize \r\nthat because it does not serve their interests.\r\nThe Commission has issued a paper on the crimes \r\nand violations committed by ISIL in Syria, entitled \r\n“Rule of terror: living under ISIL in Syria”. Despite \r\nthe f lagrant violations committed by ISIL in Syria, \r\nas described in the paper, the Human Rights Council \r\nreport does not demand that Qatar and the Saudi regime \r\ncease their support for the f low of foreign terrorists \r\nfrom Turkey into Syria across our common borders; \r\nthat the Qatari and Saudi regimes stop financing the \r\nterrorists; or that the United States, France and other \r\nWestern States abide by their commitments under \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 2170 (2014) and 2178 \r\n(2014). However, paragraph 11 of the Commission’s \r\nreport notes that\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“The external support provided to all \r\nbelligerents in Syria has contributed to the \r\nradicalization of armed groups, ultimately \r\nbenefitting ISIS. Charity organizations and \r\nwealthy individuals funded radical entities willing \r\nto promote their ideologies and serve their agendas. \r\nArms and support provided to armed groups \r\ndeemed as moderate have repeatedly fallen into the \r\nhands of more radical actors, including ISIS.”\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nThose are the words of the report. Today we have heard \r\nthat the United Arab Emirates authorities have listed \r\n83 groups that deal with Muslims and the Islamic \r\nreligion as terrorist organizations, transforming that \r\nreligion and its individual followers into commercial \r\nproducts, notably in the Gulf States.\r\nUnfortunately, the new resolutions have come a \r\nlittle late, which has led to the loss of many lives in \r\nSyria, Lebanon and Egypt. The politicized resolutions \r\nagainst the Syrian Government adopted by the Council \r\nhave undermined the Syrian people and increased their \r\nsuffering, because the resolutions have sent the wrong \r\nmessages to the terrorists and those who sponsor them. \r\nThe effect of these resolutions is to protect those people \r\nand offer them impunity for crimes in the future.\r\nThe resolutions have also frustrated international \r\nefforts to ensure that the Human Rights Council is able \r\nto address all violations of human rights throughout the \r\nworld within clear frameworks that apply to all without \r\ndiscrimination, as noted by Mr. Baudelaire Ndong Ella \r\nearlier. The Council is a body that is run with funding \r\nfrom Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and by hegemonic \r\nPowers that toy with human rights. Its resolutions \r\nhad been blocked for many years and have in turn \r\nhampered the cooperation and openness that Syria has \r\nrecently demonstrated in dealing with the international \r\ncommissions. Those are now well-known issues. They \r\nare not negotiable or open to question. There is no doubt \r\nabout the situation.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to recall to Member \r\nStates that the primary motivation for the establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council was the shared \r\nunderstanding that a number of influential States had \r\npoliticized human rights in the work of the Comission \r\n14-63039 13/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\non Human Rights and had sought to adopt agendas \r\nconvenient to them. The so-called international \r\ncommunity therefore came together to try to transform \r\nthe Commission into the Human Rights Council and \r\nto adopt a follow-up mechanism, the universal periodic \r\nreview, so as to address all human rights matters on an \r\nequal footing — that is, to deal with all Governments \r\nin an equitable manner without any distinction \r\nor politicization. That is a dream that has not yet, \r\nunfortunately, become a reality, with adverse impacts \r\non the great hopes expressed by all and entrusted to the \r\nUnited Nations to protect and promote human rights.\r\nMr. Jiddou (Mauritania): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates. The African Group welcomes the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council, Mr. Baudelaire Ndong \r\nElla, to the General Assembly and wishes to extend our \r\nappreciation for the opportunity to engage in a general \r\ndebate on the activities of the Council, as presented \r\nin document A/69/53 and its addendum. The Group \r\ncommends the Council President for his leadership, \r\nhis commitment to the work of that body during his \r\ntenure, his professionalism and the constructive and \r\ntransparent way in which he conducts the work of the \r\nCouncil. The Group wishes to express its continuous \r\nsupport for his endeavours.\r\nMr. Emiliou (Cyprus), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe African Group wishes to reaffirm the \r\nCouncil’s mandate, as contained in resolution 60/251, \r\nin promoting universal respect for the protection of \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal \r\nmanner, and to make recommendations thereon. It \r\nis on that basis that the Group has been consistently \r\nsupportive of the work of the Council. The Group views \r\nthe principles underpinning the Council’s mandate \r\nas extremely important, particularly with respect to \r\nthe principle of cooperation and genuine dialogue \r\naimed at strengthening the capacity of Member States \r\nto comply with their human rights obligations. It is \r\ntherefore incumbent upon the Council, in discharging \r\nits mandate, to firmly ground its work on universality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity in the consideration of \r\nhuman rights issues.\r\nThe Group is of the view that the universal \r\nparticipation of all States Members of the United \r\nNations in the work of the Human Rights Council is \r\nof paramount importance. In that regard, the Group \r\nwarmly welcomes the establishment of the Voluntary \r\nFund for Financial and Technical Assistance to support \r\nthe participation of the least developed countries and \r\nthe small island developing States in the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. The Group further welcomes \r\nthe steps taken for the operationalization of the Fund, \r\nincluding the facilitation of the participation of experts \r\nfrom member countries in the Council sessions. The \r\nGroup would like to encourage the President to ensure \r\nthat more African countries benefit from the Fund.\r\nThe African Group is convinced that the universal \r\nperiodic review (UPR) remains the most distinct \r\nmechanism of universal application to assist States \r\nin fulfilling their human rights obligations. In our \r\nview, the mechanism remains relevant and is key in \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights. The \r\nGroup would like to reaffirm the need to preserve the \r\nmechanism’s cooperative nature and the principle of \r\ndialogue. The Group firmly believes that it is critical \r\nthat the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Financial \r\nand Technical Assistance for the implementation of the \r\nUPR recommendations be properly resourced for the \r\npurpose of assisting States to develop their national \r\ncapacity and expertise for the implementation of the \r\naccepted recommendations.\r\nWhile the African Group reiterates its support \r\nfor the mechanism and the special procedures of the \r\nCouncil and the important work they undertake in \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the Group believes that there is \r\na need for the rationalization of the mechanism and the \r\nspecial procedures so as to ensure their effectiveness. \r\nThe Group would also like to emphasize the need for \r\nthe procedures to comply with the institution-building \r\npackage, the code of conduct of mandate-holders and \r\nthe terms of reference of their respective mandates.\r\nIn recent times, the Council has faced challenges \r\nrelating to governance, particularly with regard to the \r\nerosion of the provisions of the institution-building \r\npackage, which is the solid foundation on which the \r\nCouncil’s mandate rests. The Group is concerned that \r\nthis erosion could, in the long run, present credibility \r\ngaps in the Council’s work.\r\nWhile the Group has also noted the immense amount \r\nof work that the Council undertakes at each session, \r\nthe challenges presented by a shortage of funding \r\nremains unresolved. The African Group believes, \r\ntherefore, that those funding shortages will affect the \r\nimplementation of the decisions and resolutions of the \r\n14/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nCouncil. We also wish to recognize the key role played \r\nby the Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, as the secretariat of the Council, in ensuring \r\nthat appropriate support is given to the Council, in line \r\nwith the framework of resolution 48/141. The African \r\nGroup takes note of the High Commissioner’s appeal \r\nmade during the general debate at this session. The \r\nGroup would therefore like to underline the necessity \r\nfor activities mandated by the Human Rights Council \r\nto be funded from the regular budget.\r\nThe annual report of the Human Rights Council \r\npresents in a comprehensive manner the resolutions \r\nthat were adopted by the Council during its yearly \r\ndeliberations. The Group is also cognizant of the \r\nprovisions of paragraph 5 (i) of resolution 60/251, \r\nwhich provides for recommendations to be made \r\nby the Council to the General Assembly. The Group \r\ntherefore supports having the universal membership of \r\nthe General Assembly deliberate on those important \r\nmatters.\r\nThis year has been marked by preparations for the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the International Year of the \r\nFamily, which the General Assembly will celebrate this \r\nyear on 3 December. The preparations for its observance \r\nhave centred on the themes of poverty, work and family, \r\nand intergenerational solidarity, as well as the various \r\nand multidimensional challenges facing the family.\r\nThe African Union adopted the African Union Plan \r\nof Action on the Family in Africa in 2004, and in 2012 \r\nadopted the African Common Position on the Family \r\nfor the twentieth anniversary of the International Year \r\nof the Family. The Group reaffirms that the family is \r\nthe natural and fundamental group unit of society, and it \r\nplays a critical role in the development and the mending \r\nof the social fabric. In that regard, the Group reaffirms \r\nits call to the United Nations Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals to include the important \r\nrole of the family in the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. We must continue directing our \r\nefforts toward strengthening and protecting the family \r\nby relieving the plight of members of every African \r\nfamily, particularly women and girls living in poverty.\r\nIn that regard, the African Group welcomes the \r\nadoption of Human Rights Council resolution 26/11 on \r\nthe protection of the family on 26 June 2014, and looks \r\nforward to the summary report on the panel discussion \r\nheld in September 2014 on the challenges and best \r\npractices relating to the protection of the family. We \r\nurge Member States, the United Nations system and \r\nnon-governmental organizations to continue to devote \r\nspecial attention and resources to protecting the \r\nfamily as “the natural and fundamental group unit of \r\nsociety,” in accordance with article 16 of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The African Group is \r\nstrongly concerned by attempts to impose new notions \r\nand concepts in that regard that are not referenced in \r\ninternational human rights law.\r\nThe principle of non-discrimination and equality \r\nare two faces of the same coin. They are indeed cross-\r\ncutting principles in the vast areas related to the full \r\nrealization of all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all. Such principles are well entrenched \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations and internationally \r\nagreed human rights instruments, as they all reaffirm \r\nthe faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity \r\nand worth of the human person, and in the equal rights \r\nof men and women, without distinction.\r\nIn that context, we are seriously concerned at \r\nthe attempt to introduce into the United Nations \r\nsome notions that have no legal foundations in any \r\ninternational human rights instrument. We are even \r\nmore disturbed at the attempts to focus on certain \r\npersons on the grounds of their sexual preferences and \r\nbehaviours, while ignoring the fact that intolerance and \r\ndiscrimination, regrettably, exist in various parts of the \r\nworld, be it on the basis of colour, race, sex or religion, \r\nto mention only a few.\r\nThe adoption of Council resolution 27/32, entitled \r\n“Human rights, sexual orientation and gender identity,” \r\nadopted on 26 September, is an illustration of such \r\nattempts. The Group is therefore concerned that \r\nnon-internationally-agreed notions, such as sexual \r\norientation and gender identity, are given attention to \r\nthe detriment of issues of paramount importance, such \r\nas the right to development and the racism agenda. The \r\nGroup particularly deplores the obstacles impeding \r\nthe advancement of the work of the Intergovernmental \r\nWorking Group on the Effective Implementation of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action and the \r\nWorking Group on the Right to Development.\r\nOur alarm does not merely stem from concerns \r\nabout the lack of legal grounds, or that the said \r\nresolution delves into matters that fall essentially \r\nwithin the domestic jurisdiction of States, contrary \r\nto the commitment in the United Nations Charter \r\nto respect the sovereignty of States and the principle \r\nof non-intervention. More importantly, our concern \r\narises from the ominous usage of those two notions: \r\n14-63039 15/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nsexual orientation and gender identity. We affirm that \r\nthose two notions are not, and should not be, linked \r\nto existing international human rights instruments. \r\nWe believe that people are not inherently vulnerable, \r\nbut some individuals and groups find themselves in \r\nvulnerable situations owing to a number of factors, \r\nincluding the socioeconomic setting they live in. Such \r\nindividuals and groups include, for example, women, \r\nchildren, the elderly, persons with disabilities, peoples \r\nunder foreign occupation, refugees, asylum seekers and \r\ninternally displaced persons.\r\nWe deplore all forms of stereotyping, exclusion, \r\nstigmatization, prejudice, intolerance, discrimination \r\nor violence directed against peoples, communities or \r\nindividuals on any grounds whatsoever and wherever \r\nthey occur. We also reaffirm article 29 of the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and the right of Member \r\nStates to enact laws that meet the just requirements \r\nof morality, public order and general welfare in a \r\ndemocratic society.\r\nWe recognize that the rights listed in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights have been codified in \r\nsubsequent international legal instruments. We note \r\nwith concern, however, the attempts that have been \r\nmade to create new rights or standards through the \r\nmisinterpretation of the Universal Declaration and \r\ninternational treaties to include notions that were never \r\narticulated or agreed by the general membership. Such \r\nattempts not only undermine the intent of the drafters \r\nand signatories of those human rights instruments, they \r\nalso seriously jeopardize the entire international human \r\nrights framework.\r\nWe therefore call on all Member States to refrain \r\nfrom attempting to give priority to the rights of \r\ncertain individuals, which could result in negative \r\ndiscrimination at the expense of other internationally \r\nagreed rights and thus run counter to the principles of \r\nnon-discrimination and equality. We call on all Member \r\nStates to continue with and step up their efforts aimed \r\nat the total elimination of all forms of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related examples of \r\nintolerance. We also urge all States and the relevant \r\ninternational human rights mechanisms to intensify \r\ntheir efforts to consolidate their commitment to the \r\npromotion and protection of the human rights of all, on \r\nan equal footing and without exception.\r\nIn conclusion, the African Group wishes to assure \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council of its support \r\nin the Council’s preparations for its ninth cycle year.\r\nMrs. Smaila (Nigeria): My delegation warmly \r\nwelcomes the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Baudelaire Ndong Ella, to New York for \r\nthis important event, namely, the presentation of the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/69/53). We \r\ncommend and thank Ambassador Ndong Ella for his \r\nleadership of the Council, as we also commend and \r\nthank his predecessor, Ambassador Henczel, for his \r\ncontributions to advancing the Council’s work.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Mauritania on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States.\r\nNigeria, as a democratic country, attaches great \r\nimportance to respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, not only within our country but across the \r\nworld. It is for that reason that we are actively engaged \r\nwith the Human Rights Council and are interested in \r\nseeing that the Council fulfils the mandate given to \r\nit by the General Assembly, which is to promote and \r\nprotect fundamental human rights. That is also why we \r\nsought re-election to the Council this year. We thank all \r\nMember States for supporting our candidature.\r\nWe are pleased to note the substantial effort that \r\nthe Council has put into fulfilling its mandate. The \r\nfact that it meets in three regular sessions each year, as \r\nwell as special sessions, enables it to devote attention \r\nto global human rights issues in a timely and effective \r\nmanner. The Council’s various special procedures are \r\nalso significant in that regard. The wide range of issues \r\ncovered in the report of the Council, and even the report’s \r\nsheer volume, reflects the complexity and multiplicity \r\nof issues that the Council has to deal with. We urge that \r\nthe Council’s work continue to be guided by resolution \r\n60/251 and be solidly grounded in the fundamental \r\nprinciples underpinning the Vienna Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action on human rights. While we see \r\nthe Council as a unique tool for the protection and \r\npromotion of all human rights, whether civil, political, \r\neconomic, social or cultural, we also hold the view that \r\na focus on economic, social and cultural rights might be \r\nthe Council’s own contribution to helping States attain \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals.\r\nThe universal periodic review (UPR) has proved to \r\nbe quite successful so far. It is remarkable that, since \r\nthe first session of the Universal Periodic Review \r\nWorking Group in February 2008, the mechanism \r\nhas attracted a high degree of participation on the \r\npart of States. Its second cycle has unquestionably \r\nreinforced the importance of the UPR mechanism as \r\n16/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\na means of promoting and protecting human rights \r\nacross the world. We are pleased to note the substantial \r\nincrease in the number of standing invitations issued to \r\nspecial-procedures mandate-holders, and the growing \r\nnumber of States that are ratifying the core humanrights \r\ninstruments. Nigeria is one of the countries that has \r\nissued such a standing invitation in a demonstration \r\nof our commitment to working with the Council as it \r\npursues its mandate.\r\nThe considerable number of resolutions adopted \r\nby the Human Rights Council in the past year is a \r\nreflection of the wide array of issues that the Council \r\ndeals with. However, it is a fact that those resolutions \r\ncome with programme-budget implications that create \r\nfunding challenges. Nigeria therefore supports the \r\ncall to the General Assembly to significantly improve \r\nfunding for the Council’s work. We also call on the \r\nAssembly to address the financial constraints that the \r\nspecial-procedures mandate-holders appointed by the \r\nCouncil face in carrying out their mandates.\r\nNigeria would like to acknowledge the fact that \r\npeople around the world expect the United Nations to \r\nprotect their human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nWe see evidence of that in the active participation \r\nof non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the \r\nactivities of the Human Rights Council. We welcome the \r\nCouncil’s engagement with NGOs as a way of allowing \r\nthe people’s voice to be heard. We would also like to \r\nsee the Council pay greater attention to the human \r\nrights situations in all non-self-governing territories, \r\nparticularly in order to hold the administering Powers \r\nto their commitment to prepare such territories for full \r\nindependence.\r\nWe note with concern the growing number of \r\nresolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council \r\nthat include issues that are not part of universally \r\nagreed human rights norms. We caution the Council to \r\nremain within the boundaries of a discussion of agreed \r\nhuman rights issues and not to stray into areas that are \r\nintrinsically divisive and controversial and do not reflect \r\nwell on the Council’s integrity and esteem. The Council \r\nshould remain a respected and cherished instrument \r\nfor promoting universal respect for the protection of \r\nall agreed human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nIts reports should therefore be free of any issues that \r\ncould reflect divisive opinions or impose obligations on \r\nMember States that they cannot faithfully implement \r\nbecause they conflict with their peoples’ values.\r\nFinally, we would like to underscore the importance \r\nof States’ cooperation in advancing the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, and we take this opportunity \r\nto affirm our unwavering commitment to cooperating \r\nwith all States in that regard. We look forward to \r\nthe Assembly’s commemoration on 10 December of \r\nInternational Human Rights Day and the launching of \r\nthe International Decade of People of African Descent.\r\nMr. Haniff (Malaysia): My delegation warmly \r\nwelcomes Ambassador Baudelaire Ndong Ella, \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, and his \r\nstatement to the General Assembly and his presentation \r\nof the Council’s report (A/69/53). Malaysia appreciates \r\nthe leadership role played by Ambassador Ndong Ella, \r\nPermanent Representative of the Gabonese Republic \r\nto the United Nations in Geneva, in carrying out his \r\nmandate to support the work of the Council.\r\nMalaysia reaffirms that human rights are universal, \r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. The \r\ninternational community must treat human rights \r\nglobally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing \r\nand with the same emphasis. Those basic principles \r\nunderpin international human rights. Countries should \r\nnot pick and choose which rights they wish to highlight \r\nor how those rights should be enjoyed, nor should \r\nthey seek to impose on others differing emphases on \r\nvarious human rights or different degrees of urgency \r\nderived from their own domestic political expediency \r\nor external pressures.\r\nMalaysia is pleased that the Human Rights Council \r\nhas continued to make progress within the mandate of \r\nresolution 60/251 and within the institution-building \r\nmechanism of its own resolution 5/1. After almost a \r\ndecade since the Council’s establishment, Malaysia \r\nbelieves that it has proved its competence and relevance. \r\nIt is increasingly capable of addressing complex human \r\nrights issues and effecting changes on the ground \r\nthrough its decisions. The discussions within the \r\nCouncil are, in our view, a healthy process towards the \r\nrealization of the highest standards of human rights \r\nas enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights.\r\nEvents around the world, particularly in the Middle \r\nEast and Africa, highlight the magnitude of the work \r\nthat the Council faces. We have seen that the Council, \r\nnotwithstanding the increasing number of agenda items \r\nbefore it, has continued to focus its attention on the \r\nhuman rights situation of Palestinians in the occupied \r\n14-63039 17/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nterritory controlled by Israel. Malaysia welcomes the \r\nCouncil’s deliberations on that issue and urges the \r\nCouncil to continue to press ahead so as to ensure that \r\nthe Palestinians are afforded their basic rights as human \r\nbeings, including their right to an independent State.\r\nThis year, the Council adopted a number of specific \r\nresolutions concerning, inter alia, the situation of \r\nhuman rights of Palestinians, including the right of \r\nPalestinians to self-determination; Israeli settlements \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan; the \r\nhuman rights situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem; ensuring respect for \r\ninternational law in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem; and follow-up to the report \r\nof the United Nations Independent International Fact-\r\nFinding Mission on the Gaza Conflict. Those resolutions \r\nreflect the grave situation affecting Palestinians in the \r\noccupied territory of Palestine.\r\nMalaysia reiterates its call for the realization of \r\nthe rights of Palestinians through a final settlement \r\nto the conflict, which would see the creation of two \r\nStates living side by side in peace and security based \r\non the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as the capital \r\nof Palestine. In addition to the issue of Palestine, my \r\ndelegation also wishes to briefly touch on a few matters \r\ndiscussed by the Council.\r\nFirst, we would like to mention the universal \r\nperiodic review (UPR). The UPR is a primary human \r\nrights mechanism whose premise is the equal treatment \r\nof all countries. In that regard, we are pleased to inform \r\nthe Assembly that Malaysia presented its final UPR \r\nreport for adoption by the Human Rights Council at its \r\ntwenty-fifth session, on 20 March 2014. After thorough \r\nconsideration, the Government of Malaysia accepted \r\n64.6 per cent, or 150 of the 232 recommendations made \r\non various human rights issues. In that regard, Malaysia \r\nhas reaffirmed its commitment to the UPR process \r\nthrough its efforts to implement the recommendations \r\nreceived.\r\nSecondly, we wish to reiterate our belief that the \r\nright to development remains a cornerstone of human \r\nrights. We urge the international community to devote \r\nparticular consideration to the right to development in \r\nthe elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nCollectively, we must acknowledge the need to strive \r\nfor greater acceptance, implementation and recognition \r\nof the right to development at the international level.\r\nThirdly, the increasing work of the Council has \r\nspurred a tremendous increase in the number of \r\nactivities assigned by mandate of the Council to the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR). We have recently witnessed a remarkable \r\nsurge of demands from Member States for support \r\nand expertise from that Office. However, only 45 per \r\ncent of the OHCHR’s resources for 2013 came from \r\nthe regular budget. In that regard, we reiterate our call, \r\nmade jointly with 54 other delegations in July, for the \r\nexploration of options that would allow Member States \r\nto gradually increase resources for the human rights \r\npillar and better align OHCHR’s mandated activities \r\nwith adequate funding through the regular budget.\r\nThe final point we wish to stress today concerns the \r\nprocess of strengthening and enhancing the effective \r\nfunctioning of the human rights treaty body system. In \r\nview of the complexity of human rights issues, Malaysia \r\nbelieves that the intrinsic responsibility to promote \r\nand protect human rights requires deeper cooperation \r\namong stakeholders. While human rights treaty bodies \r\nexist to oversee compliance by States parties and to \r\nmonitor their efforts to improve human-rights-related \r\nsituations, it is clear that significant residual issues still \r\nneed to be addressed in order to enable human rights \r\ntreaty bodies to meet their objectives. Malaysia remains \r\ncommitted to continuing its support for efforts aimed at \r\nstrengthening the human rights treaty bodies.\r\nTo conclude, we wish to acknowledge that the \r\nHuman Rights Council has, in many respects, been \r\nsuccessful. That positive development has continued \r\nunder the leadership of the current President. We hope \r\nthat the Council will carry on with its good work in \r\npromoting and protecting human rights for all. Malaysia \r\nwould also like to underscore that, despite the many \r\nachievements to date, we believe that more can be done \r\nto enhance and uphold the rights of victims of human \r\nrights violations. Malaysia is committed to that goal \r\nand will continue to strongly support the work of the \r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Viktorov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I would like, first of all, to congratulate and \r\nsupport the States that have been elected members of the \r\nHuman Rights Council at the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In 2014, the Russian Federation was \r\nonce again a member of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nfact that Russia’s candidature received the support of \r\n92 per cent of the States voting demonstrates the broad \r\nrecognition of the effectiveness of Russia’s approach, \r\n18/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nwhich is based on frank and equitable dialogue on the \r\nissues involved in ensuring fundamental human rights \r\nand freedoms.\r\nWe note that the work of the Council has recently \r\nshown an increasing bias towards the settling of political \r\nscores and the unjustified mentoring and ostracizing of \r\nStates for political reasons. We believe that the primary \r\ntask of the Human Rights Council should be to restore \r\nthe mutually respectful nature of intergovernmental \r\ndialogue. We believe that the fundamental principles \r\nof the Council’s work should be cooperation: equitable \r\ncooperation among States based on respect for their \r\nsovereignty.\r\nIn order to make the Council’s activities more \r\neffective, we need to focus on the issue of providing \r\ntechnical assistance to States, with, however, their direct \r\nconsent. The ongoing attempts to impose upon States \r\nvarious monitoring procedures that often duplicate \r\neach other are unfortunate. Their proliferation is a true \r\nburden to the United Nations budget, and the ends in \r\nthat regard rarely justify the means. We call upon States \r\nto conscientiously approach the financial impacts of the \r\ndraft resolutions they sponsor and seriously consider \r\nthe budget issue relating to the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights.\r\nWe are concerned about the clear trend of using the \r\nHuman Rights Council to include various politically \r\ncharged matters on the agenda of the General Assembly \r\nwith a view to further mulling over those topics. We \r\nare worried about increased attempts to refer human \r\nrights country files to the Security Council and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. We think that today the \r\nonly objective mechanism for monitoring the upholding \r\nof human rights is the universal periodic review, which \r\nis dependent upon the goodwill of States to follow the \r\nprocedure and to accept and implement the majority \r\nof recommendations they subsequently receive. We \r\nthink that all participants in the review process and the \r\nimplementation of recommendations should spare no \r\neffort in ensuring that the process remain objective and \r\nimpartial.\r\nWe also call attention to the fact that a number \r\nof States attempt to bring matters into the work of \r\nthe Council that have no direct ties with human \r\nrights nor fall within the purview of the Council as \r\nestablished by resolution 60/251. That is demonstrated \r\nby ongoing attempts to include on the Council’s agenda \r\nissues pertaining to the responsibility to protect. We \r\nbelieve that the Council, in broadening all human \r\nrights — namely, civil, political, economic, social and \r\ncultural rights — should discuss those rights on an \r\nequal footing. Unfortunately, the issues of economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights continue to garner a \r\ndisproportionately small amount of attention.\r\nThe Council’s system of special procedures \r\ncontinues to expand. As the process is extremely costly, \r\nthe additional duplication of functions is problematic. \r\nThat was made clear during the dialogue with the \r\nSpecial Rapporteurs and Independent Experts of the \r\nCouncil and the Third Committee. In that context, \r\nthe added value was, unfortunately, not very clear. \r\nWe believe that the authors of Human Rights Council \r\nresolutions should avoid instructing special rapporteurs \r\nto send reports to the General Assembly, as it would \r\nseem the Assembly should decide for itself which \r\nspecial procedures reports it should take on board.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that Russia \r\ncontinues to support the work of the Council. It is \r\nimportant in our view to ensure that the Council not lose \r\nthe credibility lent to by the General Assembly in 2006. \r\nThe growing politicization in the work of the Human \r\nRights Council, the strengthening of its quasi-judicial \r\nor monitoring aspects as well as shrinking cooperation \r\nwith it could drag the Council back to the state of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights that we saw in the 1990s \r\nand early 2000s, which would once again discredit the \r\nwork of the United Nations in promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights. We stand ready to continue to assist in \r\nefforts aimed at ensuring that such a turn of events not \r\ntake place.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor his statement made under agenda item 63, “Report \r\nof the Human Rights Council”. It is significant that \r\nwe are considering the report of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil (A/69/53) at this meeting today, as the sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly is beginning \r\npreparations to mark the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations in 2015.\r\nThe Human Rights Council was created with a \r\nmandate given by our leaders at the sixtieth anniversary \r\nsummit of the United Nations in 2005 and came into \r\nexistence in 2006. As we draw closer to completing \r\na decade in the life of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nmust remain mindful of the reasons for its creation \r\nand reflect our assessment in the outcome of the 2015 \r\nsummit.\r\n14-63039 19/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nThe Council must continue to perform its role in \r\nconstructive international dialogue and cooperation \r\nin solving international problems within a framework \r\nof friendly relations among States. Of all the various \r\nmechanisms of the Council, the universal periodic \r\nreview (UPR), which is in its second cycle, has had \r\nremarkable success in encouraging States to recognize \r\nand resolve gaps in human rights protection. Indeed, it \r\nhas emerged as the most positive and constructive of \r\nprocesses and is accepted and valued by all Member \r\nStates. We believe that the strength of the Human \r\nRights Council lies in its adherence to the principles \r\nof universality, transparency, impartiality, objectivity, \r\nnon-selectivity and constructive international dialogue, \r\nand the success of the UPR process stands testimony to \r\nthat fact.\r\nThe indivisibility, interrelatedness and interdependence \r\nof all human rights, including the right to development, \r\nhave been reiterated time and again by the General \r\nAssembly. We value the role of the Council in advancing \r\nthe promotion and protection of fundamental rights and \r\nfreedoms and appreciate the work accomplished by it \r\nin addressing a wide range of thematic issues despite \r\nfunding shortfalls. At the same time, the increase in \r\nthe workload of the Council must not, in our view, \r\ncreate problems for the participation of Member States, \r\nparticularly the smaller Member States, namely, the \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nThe Human Rights Council’s special procedures \r\nare an important Council mechanism for a genuine \r\ndialogue for strengthening the capacity of Member \r\nStates. It is therefore of fundamental importance \r\nthat mandate-holders remain truly independent and \r\nimpartial and carry out their tasks with responsibility \r\nand sensitivity in accordance with their mandates. Their \r\nrecommendations should be specific, constructive \r\nand relevant to the country — and they should not be \r\nideologically driven — in order to enable Governments \r\nto take note of their reports and engage in any follow-\r\nup actions.\r\nSweeping generalizations by special procedure \r\nmandate-holders does not in any way contribute to \r\nthat mutually desired objective. Any reinterpretation \r\nof the Council’s code of conduct or departure from \r\ntheir mandates would weaken the important functions \r\nentrusted to them and erode their credibility. The \r\neffectiveness of special procedure mandate-holders \r\nwould, in our view, be seriously compromised if the \r\nprocess of selecting these individuals was mired in \r\ncontroversy.\r\nIn the context of prevention, serious attention needs \r\nto be paid on how information related to human rights \r\nsituations is analysed and reported. Modern technology, \r\nespecially the Internet, has transformed the speed and \r\nreach of information, and one needs to be mindful of \r\nthe damaging power of misinformation. The focus \r\nshould be on advocacy and consensus-building through \r\npromotion of better understanding of human rights \r\nissues among Member States and all stakeholders. This \r\nis obviously an arduous task that requires investment \r\nboth in terms of time and resources.\r\nWe congratulate the new High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, Prince Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, and \r\nwould like to extend our full cooperation to him for \r\nthe successful discharge of his mandate. We value \r\nthe efforts and expertise of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) in assisting States in capacity-building. In \r\nthat regard, one cannot overemphasize the need for \r\nbalanced representation in its staffing patterns not only \r\nin terms of gender but also of geography and culture. \r\nThat will only enhance the OHCHR’s understanding of \r\nthe complexities of the world we live in. We reiterate \r\nour support for an increase in the OHCHR’s financial \r\nresources from the regular budget and emphasize the \r\nimportance of greater transparency in the management \r\nof the extrabudgetary resources.\r\nGreater synergy, dialogue and cooperation between \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the OHCHR, particularly \r\nin the Secretary-General’s strategic framework, \r\nProgramme 20, the OHCHR strategic management plan \r\nand thematic strategies will, in our view, enhance the \r\ntrust of Member States in the OHCHR and advance our \r\ncommon endeavour. It would be more effective if such \r\nlinkages were developed within the framework of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which is the only organ mandated to \r\noversee the work of the Human Rights Council and the \r\nHigh Commissioner.\r\nHuman rights are recognized as one of the three \r\npillars of the United Nations system, the other two \r\nbeing development and peace and security. Without a \r\nsecure and peaceful environment, universal adherence \r\nto human rights standards will remain an elusive goal. \r\nSimilarly, the right to development is an inalienable \r\nhuman right central to the purpose and mission of \r\nthe United Nations. While we strive to identify more \r\n20/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\ncooperative methods for strengthening the normative \r\nframework for human rights within the United Nations \r\nsystem, it is imperative that we ensure full respect \r\nfor the sovereign equality, territorial integrity and \r\npolitical independence of all Member States, which are \r\nthe core principles of Article 2 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. The specific situation and context of \r\neach State must be kept in mind. The commitment to \r\nthe capacity-building of States should be matched by \r\nadequate resources and that support should be provided \r\nbased on the request of national Governments and on \r\nmutual agreements, based on their national priorities.\r\nIndia remains firmly committed to the idea of a just \r\nand equitable society through upholding the principles \r\nenshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights of 10 December 1948. It is in that spirit that we \r\nreiterate our commitment, and express our happiness, \r\nat being overwhelmingly re-elected by the Assembly in \r\nOctober to serve on the Human Rights Council for the \r\nnext three years, from 2015.\r\nMr. Laram (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike at the outset to thank Mr. Baudelaire Ndong \r\nElla, President of the Human Rights Council, for his \r\nparticipation and for presenting the annual reports \r\n(A/69/53) that represent the Council’s efforts to uphold, \r\npreserve and defend human rights. We wish him every \r\nsuccess in his efforts to lead the Council.\r\nWe greatly value the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We firmly believe that, eight years after \r\nits establishment, the Council has an important and \r\nvital role to play. The Council is the cornerstone for \r\nstrengthening human rights and basic freedoms for \r\nall, without discrimination and in a fair and just \r\nmanner. The State of Qatar attaches great importance \r\nto the promotion, respect and strengthening of human \r\nrights. That is the basis of our national policy. It is a \r\nstrategic option that we have chosen in the context \r\nof the comprehensive reform of the State of Qatar. It \r\nwas a key element in the Qatar National Vision 2030, \r\nwhich includes the important fields of education, the \r\nenvironment, health, the empowerment of women and \r\nthe rights of children, with a view to building a safe \r\nand stable society based on the principles of justice, \r\nequality and the rule of law.\r\nThe State of Qatar plays an effective and \r\nconstructive  role in strengthening human rights at \r\nthe national, regional and international levels. In \r\nthat context, we participated actively during our \r\nmembership in the Human Rights Council. As we \r\napproach our third term, we affirm our obligations in \r\nrespect of and commitment to human rights. We look \r\nforward to continuing to support and cooperate with \r\nthe United Nations human rights mechanisms in every \r\nway possible to guarantee respect for human rights and \r\nbasic freedoms throughout the world.\r\nThe second national report presented to the \r\nWorking Group on the Universal Periodic Review was \r\nan important opportunity to introduce Qatar’s important \r\npolicies in the area of the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights and the relevant progress achieved. Qatar \r\nhas renewed its open invitation to all special procedures \r\nmandate-holders within the framework of the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nThe State of Qatar has also implemented many of \r\nthe recommendations that were first presented in the \r\nframework of the first interactive session in the context \r\nof the first universal periodic review report, namely, \r\nthe amendment of the criminal code and the adoption \r\nof a law on trafficking in persons for the protection of \r\nvictims and the promotion of international cooperation. \r\nIn addition, Qatar has established a national human \r\nrights committee to protect victims of conflicts in \r\nthe framework of the implementation of international \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThe State of Qatar has strengthened its efforts in \r\nthe legislative and institutional framework to promote \r\nhuman rights awareness and basic freedoms for \r\npersons with disabilities. We have launched the One \r\nBillion Strong global initiative, which seeks to provide \r\nadequate and decent living conditions for persons with \r\ndisabilities. We have also given much consideration to \r\nthe health and education sectors. We issued Law No. 6 \r\nof 2013 on health and education, which seeks to provide \r\nsustainable financial resources to support education \r\nand medical services. We also provide special care \r\nfor the elderly, as an essential segment of society, and \r\ndo all that is necessary to enhance their status in our \r\nsociety. That is an important part of our Constitution, \r\nas we support the family, motherhood, children and the \r\nelderly.\r\nWe are concerned about the situation of human \r\nrights in the occupied Palestinian territory and in \r\nother occupied Arab territories. I refer in particular to \r\nHuman Rights Council resolution 25/29 on the illegality \r\nof the seizure of land by force and the attempt to \r\ndismember Palestinian land, including East Jerusalem, \r\nby continuing to build settlements. The resolution \r\nexpresses concern with regard to Israel’s practices in \r\n14-63039 21/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nterms of its violations of the Palestinian people’s human \r\nrights, including through the excessive use of force and \r\nits military operations, which have led to the injury \r\nand victimization of many innocent women, children \r\nand peaceful demonstrators. The Council has indicated \r\nthat all such practices should end immediately and \r\nthe Palestinian people’s human rights should be fully \r\nrespected.\r\nThe Human Rights Council’s response to the \r\ncontinuing humanitarian crisis in Syria is of the \r\nutmost importance, particularly in the light of the \r\nserious deterioration of the human rights situation \r\nand the killing and targeting of civilians, which are \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and of all \r\nprinciples. Human Rights Council resolution 27/16 has \r\ncondemned the Syrian regime for not cooperating with \r\nthe independent international commission of inquiry \r\non the Syrian Arab Republic. It has also condemned \r\nall random attacks, including those involving the use \r\nof explosive barrels in residential areas and against \r\ncivilians and civil institutions. The resolution also \r\naffirmed the responsibility of the Syrian regime for the \r\ncases of forced disappearances and demanded that the \r\nSyrian regime assume its responsibility with regard to \r\nthe protection of Syrian civilians. In the light of the \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian situation in Syria, we would \r\nlike to reaffirm the importance of full accountability \r\nand that the international community should take all \r\nthe necessary measures to protect the human rights of \r\nthe brotherly Syrian people.\r\nIn conclusion, we affirm the need to continue to \r\npromote and strengthen human rights and to pursue \r\ncooperation with international organizations and \r\nrelevant United Nations entities so that human rights are \r\nprotected and upheld, in cooperation with the Human \r\nRights Council and its special mechanisms and entities.\r\nMr. Khan (Indonesia): Allow me to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor providing us with the Council’s reports (A/69/53) \r\non its twentieth, twenty-first and twenty-second special \r\nsessions, as well as its twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth \r\nand twenty-seventh sessions. My delegation is very \r\nappreciative of the role of the President of the Council \r\nand attaches high importance to the significant work \r\nthat he and the Council have been carrying out.\r\nIndonesia greatly values the Council as a key \r\nintergovernmental body in the work of strengthening \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights around \r\nthe globe. For almost three years now, Indonesia has \r\nbeen serving as a member of the Council, working \r\nconstructively with other countries to address \r\nhumanrights violations and produce recommendations.\r\nWe should recall that the General Assembly \r\ndecided to establish the Human Rights Council as part \r\nof its effort to tackle the political manipulations and \r\ndouble standards that were often practised in the name \r\nof promoting and protecting human rights. We firmly \r\nbelieve that the Council should carry out its noble \r\ntask of improving the protection of all human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms for all without distinction, \r\nand in a fair and equitable manner, in accordance with \r\nthe mandates set out in resolution 60/251, of 15 March \r\n2006.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, Indonesia would like to \r\nhighlight the following crucial points. First, as of \r\n1 October, the Council has seen a record number \r\nof 53 special procedures with thematic and country \r\nmandates. While some may consider that trend necessary, \r\nmy delegation would like to underline the need for the \r\nCouncil to avoid duplication and politicization and to \r\nprioritize an equitable representation of each regional \r\ngroup in establishing special procedures. My delegation \r\nalso wishes to reiterate how critical it is that the special \r\nprocedures receive the necessary political and financial \r\nsupport and are able to discharge their mandates \r\nin a coherent, effective, objective, independent and \r\nnon-politicized manner.\r\nSecondly, in addressing specific human rights \r\nsituations, it is important that the Council engage with \r\nthe countries concerned in a spirit of genuine partnership \r\nand constructive dialogue. No country is truly immune \r\nto human rights violations. Every situation requires \r\ncareful observation if a long-term and sustainable \r\nsolution is to be found. We would also like to underline \r\nthe critical role of the universal periodic review \r\n(UPR) as a peer review among countries on an equal \r\nfooting, and an important mechanism for strengthening \r\nefforts to foster the values of democracy and human \r\nrights. We stress the importance of the UPR process in \r\ncreating realistic and implementable recommendations \r\nfor addressing specific human rights situations. As a \r\ndeveloping country, we would also like to highlight \r\nthe need to provide more technical assistance in the \r\npreparation of the report and in implementing the UPR \r\nrecommendations.\r\nOur third point is that the Council should respect \r\nand be sensitive to different values, norms and \r\ntraditions, and should exercise restraint in promoting \r\n22/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\ncertain values, behaviours and practices that do not \r\nenjoy international consensus or acceptance. Since we \r\nall see the Human Rights Council as the main United \r\nNations mechanism for addressing global human rights \r\nconcerns, Indonesia would like to encourage it not to \r\nengage in unclear or controversial subjects that tend to \r\nbe divisive and lacking in recognition of the various \r\nvalues, norms, cultures and traditions of others.\r\nFor its part, Indonesia is always ready to strengthen \r\nits engagement with human rights mechanisms, \r\nespecially in the Human Rights Council. Just a few \r\nweeks ago, Indonesia was re-elected to the Council. \r\nWe are truly grateful for all the support we have been \r\ngiven. I would like once again to reiterate Indonesia’s \r\ncommitment to continuing to work with others to make \r\nthe Council more effective and ensure that its work \r\nbenefits all States Members of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, Indonesia would again like to \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council for \r\nhis updates and reports. It is our fervent hope that the \r\nCouncil’s deliberations will continue to help to support \r\nour efforts in the field of human rights and in achieving \r\na tangible impact on the ground.\r\nMr. Ahsan (Bangladesh): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor his presentation of the Council’s annual report \r\n(A/69/53). We greatly appreciate his leadership in \r\ntaking the work of the Council forward.\r\nIn the short period of time since its inception in \r\n2006, the Human Rights Council’s work has proliferated \r\nimmensely. Guided by the principles of universality, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, it has \r\ncovered considerable ground in assisting Member States \r\nin meeting their obligations regarding the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. During this year it has \r\nadopted a total of 105 resolutions and 47 decisions, \r\nwhile also holding a huge number of panel discussions.\r\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights has also successfully discharged the \r\nresponsibilities entrusted to it by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The universal periodic review (UPR), \r\nthe Council’s ubiquitous peer-review mechanism, \r\nhas proved its worth, too. With universality and \r\nnon-selectivity as its strengths, the mechanism has \r\nmade countries face scrutiny regardless of their region, \r\nsize, influence or level of development. As a founding \r\nmember of the Council, Bangladesh has been supportive \r\nof the UPR. We have already been through our second \r\ncycle of the review and have accepted as many as 164 \r\nrecommendations.\r\nWe also believe that the system of special \r\nprocedures is important to pursuing the effective \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. If those \r\nmechanisms are to succeed, their credibility, objectivity \r\nand impartiality must be upheld. We should also be \r\ncareful that efforts aimed at realizing human rights do \r\nnot violate the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations — the principles of respect for State sovereignty \r\nand non-interference in countries’ internal affairs.\r\nWhile the Council is engaging in new areas of \r\nconcern, we are still struggling to adequately address \r\nsome areas of long-standing gross violations of human \r\nrights. We remain concerned about the continuing denial \r\nof the rights of the Palestinian people in the occupied \r\nterritories. The Council must make more serious and \r\nsincere efforts to address such gross violations of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nClimate change is the greatest environmental \r\nchallenge facing the world today. The international \r\ncommunity has a moral obligation to support the \r\npopulations of countries that are victims of climate \r\nchange. This is a global problem. From Alaska to the \r\nPacific Islands, climate change affects a large majority \r\nof countries to varying degrees and in different \r\npatterns. However, its impact is felt more acutely by the \r\npopulations of developing countries, who are already \r\nin a vulnerable situation, mostly for economic reasons. \r\nWe are therefore particularly happy with the Human \r\nRights Council’s adoption by consensus of a resolution \r\non human rights and climate change. We look forward \r\nto the panel discussion on the subject to be held during \r\nthe March session of the Council.\r\nDuring the High-level Dialogue on International \r\nMigration and Development held in October 2013 \r\n(see A/68/PV.25 through A/68/PV.28), States agreed, \r\namong other things, to effectively promote and \r\nprotect the human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nof all migrants, regardless of their migration status, \r\nto respect and promote the rights of migrants in their \r\nworkplaces, and to cooperate on labour-mobility \r\nprogrammes. We have yet to witness any effort or \r\npolitical will to implement those commitments. It is \r\nalarming that the plight of migrants around the world, \r\nwhich is rooted in their status in most cases and \r\namplified by the discrimination and xenophobia that \r\nmigrants increasingly face, continues unabated. We \r\nare equally disturbed by the continued manifestation of \r\n14-63039 23/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nracial crimes, intolerance, Islamophobia and religious \r\nprofiling. Such acts and all related forms of intolerance \r\nmust continue to be forcefully combated, as prescribed \r\nin the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action.\r\nThe full enjoyment of human rights cannot be \r\npossible unless the challenges of development are met. \r\nThat requires concerted national and international efforts \r\nto eliminate economic deprivation, hunger and disease \r\nin all parts of the world. Due to inherent socioeconomic, \r\nenvironmental and demographic situations, developing \r\ncountries, including the least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), face a number of impediments in their efforts \r\nto ensure the full enjoyment of human rights, including \r\nthe right to development for all its citizens. Some key \r\nchallenges include poverty and income inequality, \r\nresource constraints, capacity deficits, the gap between \r\nnational priorities and donor policies, the impact of \r\nclimate change and gaps in legal enforcement. Those \r\nchallenges can be overcome by seeking solutions from \r\nwithin countries — keeping in view the particularities \r\nof each situation and the priorities set by national \r\nGovernments, based on national interest — and not by \r\nimposing ideas, policies and strategies from outside, \r\nwhich may undermine national priorities, sovereignty \r\nand independence.\r\nTechnical cooperation that is in line with the \r\naforementioned principles and premised on its \r\nconception as a right, not a charity, is crucial in that \r\nregard. It should recognize the essential right to \r\ndevelopment and be supported by the principles of \r\nequality at all levels, non-discrimination, participation, \r\ntransparency and accountability for all. Technical \r\ncooperation should be aimed at the maintenance of \r\nstable and sustained economic growth. This must be \r\nsupported by simultaneous actions, such as offering \r\nincreased concessional assistance to developing \r\ncountries, including LDCs, and eliminating trade \r\nbarriers and resolving the debt crisis.\r\nI should like to conclude by thanking Member \r\nStates for electing Bangladesh as a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for the term 2015-2017. The \r\nGovernment of Bangladesh remains deeply committed \r\nto the promotion and protection of universal human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms at the national and \r\ninternational levels. As a new member of the Council, \r\nwe look forward to remaining constructively engaged \r\nwith the work of the Council.\r\nMr. Tesfay (Eritrea): My delegation wishes to \r\nwelcome the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nand takes note of his briefing. Eritrea associates itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nMauritania on behalf of the Group of African States. \r\nI should like to take advantage of the presence of the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council to express \r\nEritrea’s view on certain issues concerning the \r\nCouncil’s activities.\r\nFirst, concerning the principles and procedures \r\nfor handling human right issues, Eritrea believes, and \r\nas it is strongly stressed by the African Group, the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement (NAM) and other regional \r\ngroups, the universal periodic review (UPR) remains a \r\nvalid mechanism for enhancing constructive dialogue \r\nand cooperation among Member States. This has been \r\nand remains a novel approach in which every country, \r\nrich or poor, big or small, has its human rights record \r\nput under scrutiny. Objectivity and impartiality must \r\nbe the guiding principles.\r\nArticle 2 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nclearly stresses that non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States must also be a guiding principle of the \r\nOrganization, including the Human Rights Council. \r\nHuman rights is a universal concept. As clearly \r\narticulated by the African Group and NAM, selectivity, \r\nnaming and shaming, and country-specific resolutions \r\nmust be rejected. It is because those principles were \r\nviolated and abused by certain countries for political \r\nexpediency that in 2006 the Commission on Human \r\nRights was dismantled and replaced with the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nWe were sure that we were establishing a new body \r\nwith higher standards of principles and procedures \r\nthan the defunct Commission on Human Rights, which \r\nhad not been up to that level. Yet today, history is \r\nrepeating itself. The Human Rights Council is once \r\nagain becoming a forum that some countries are using \r\nto advance their interests and geopolitical agendas, \r\nincluding that of regime change. Naming and shaming \r\ndeclarations and country-specific resolutions are \r\nbecoming the norm rather than the exception. That has \r\nto stop.\r\nThe Human Rights Council should not allow itself \r\nto be used by any country, big or small, rich or poor. \r\nEritrea is deeply concerned by the current behaviour \r\nof some Member States in the Human Rights Council \r\nin the implementation and interpretation of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the Council. This is a serious challenge \r\nthat has to be addressed by the Human Rights Council \r\nin order to uphold its credibility and legitimacy. I hope \r\n24/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nthat when the Council President returns to Geneva, \r\nhe will ask the Council to verify the credibility and \r\nreliability of the allegations and the accusers.\r\nSecondly, concerning the disbursement and \r\nrationalization of funding, every year the number of \r\ncountry mandate resolutions adopted by the Human \r\nRights Council grows. The proliferation of country \r\nmandates ought to be reviewed as a way of limiting \r\nexpenditures and rationalizing the work of the Human \r\nRights Council. For example, the establishment of the \r\npost of Special Rapporteur and a commission of inquiry \r\nfor the same issue and the same country, in this case \r\nEritrea, is not only redundant, but also a waste of time \r\nand resources that cannot be justified and rationalized.\r\nGiven the fact that there are no nations or \r\nGovernments that do not have human rights issues and \r\nproblems, it is not possible to create country mandate \r\nholders for all States Members of the United Nations. \r\nThe Fund allocated for such redundant activities could \r\nbe utilized for enhancing other important activities in \r\nwhich the Human Rights Council is engaged, such as \r\ntechnical assistance and capacity-building. Given the \r\nfact that the Human Rights Council is facing major \r\nfinancial constraints to fully implement its mandated \r\nactivities, this is an area where unnecessary expenditure \r\ncan be cut.\r\nThe Human Rights Council must avoid overlapping \r\nmandates and activities. Before asking for extra \r\nfunding, it must address issues of redundancy and \r\nduplication seriously. It must clearly articulate, justify \r\nand rationalize its expenditures before coming up with \r\nlump-sum amounts. The Fifth Committee, the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions \r\nand other concerned United Nations bodies must have \r\na thorough discussion on whether the Council’s request \r\nis justifiable and cost-effective.\r\nThirdly, on the modus operandi, or rules of \r\nengagement, of the Human Rights Council, Eritrea \r\nstrongly believes that the Council must follow a clear \r\nprocedure that will safeguard it from certain politically \r\nmotivated resolutions and from being railroaded under \r\nthe pretext of human rights violations, in particular \r\nwhen this is done at the last minute while the concerned \r\nState is going through the UPR process. The Human \r\nRights Council, which is mandated by the General \r\nAssembly to make sure that all types of human rights are \r\nrespected and protected, must implement the letter and \r\nspirit of the rule of law. It must provide an opportunity \r\nfor the concerned and accused State to defend itself and \r\nexplain the human rights situation in the country. The \r\ndictum that one is innocent until proven guilty must \r\nbe respected by all Member States, as well as by the \r\nCouncil. The Council must constantly be reminded \r\nthat, according to the Charter, it does not have the right \r\nor the mandate to intervene in the internal affairs of \r\nany Member State. The political independence and \r\nsovereignty of every Member State must be respected.\r\nThe Council must base its decisions and resolutions \r\non concrete information and evidence, rather than \r\non politically motivated, sweeping statements or \r\nallegations compiled by one or two individuals in the \r\nname of a special rapporteur or commission of inquiry. \r\nTo depend on a report by one or two individuals is not \r\nonly procedurally wrong; it is also a substantial travesty \r\nof justice.\r\nThe members of the Council should thoroughly \r\ninterrogate the country mandate-holders to ascertain \r\nthe facts. The Council must look into each country’s \r\nspecific situation and stage of development. Its analysis \r\nof the Eritrean situation, in this case, is not only off \r\nthe mark; it also does not take into consideration that \r\ncertain parts of Eritrea’s sovereign territory, including \r\nthe town of Badme, are occupied. Unjust sanctions have \r\nbeen imposed on the people of Eritrea.\r\nThere are human rights issues that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil must deal with. Eritrea’s right to development \r\nmust be respected. The Human Rights Council, as the \r\nbody mandated to enhance and promote human rights, \r\nmust be reminded that its decisions and resolutions can \r\nhave serious financial and political ramifications. Its \r\nnoble mandate should not be compromised under any \r\npretext or circumstance.\r\nIn conclusion, Eritrea is fully committed to human \r\nrights values and principles. To cite some of those, \r\nwomen’s rights are fully respected. They have the \r\nright to own property. They earn equal pay for equal \r\nwork. Female genital mutilation has been criminalized. \r\nUnder the motto “education for all”, education is free \r\nfor all from kindergarten to the tertiary level. Eritrea \r\nhas achieved Millennium Development Goals 4, 5 and \r\n6 and is on track to achieve Goals 2, 3 and 7. Eritrea \r\nis the most peaceful country in the volatile Horn of \r\nAfrica and the Red Sea region. It must be commended, \r\nnot targeted. Once again, Eritrea’s right to development \r\nmust be respected.\r\nMrs. Natividad (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nthanks Mr. Baudelaire Ndong Ella for his report on the \r\n14-63039 25/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\n2014 sessions of the Human Rights Council (A/69/53), \r\nin which the Philippines was privileged to take part. \r\nIn our participation as a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the Philippines has been guided by the \r\ndirective of resolution 60/251, to the effect that the \r\nwork of the Council should be based on universality, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity, constructive \r\ninternational dialogue and cooperation.\r\nIt is in this light that we wish to continue to underline \r\nthe primacy of the universal periodic review (UPR) \r\nas the foremost mechanism for reviewing the human \r\nrights records of Member States. By affording States a \r\nsingular opportunity to engage in dialogue with other \r\nStates and stakeholders, including civil society, the \r\nUPR ensures that best practices and recommendations \r\nare exchanged, processed and filtered through to \r\nthe domestic level. We therefore take heart that the \r\nsecond cycle of the UPR has achieved not just 100 per \r\ncent participation, but also high-level participation, \r\nillustrating the commitment of States to the process.\r\nThe year 2014 saw the establishment of three \r\nnew mandates in the special procedures: a Special \r\nRapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities, a \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the negative impact of unilateral \r\ncoercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights \r\nand an Independent Expert on capacity-building and \r\ntechnical cooperation with Côte d’Ivoire in the field \r\nof human rights. We laud the hard work and passion \r\nof our special procedures mandate-holders. Even as \r\nour delegation recognizes the vital role of the special \r\nprocedures, we continue to assert, as we have done in \r\nprevious sessions, that the performance of the mandates \r\nmust always be in accordance with resolution 60/251, \r\nwhich recognizes that the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights should be based on the principles \r\nof cooperation and genuine dialogue, and aimed at \r\nstrengthening the capacity of member States to comply \r\nwith their human rights obligations.\r\nIn the review of States’ human rights records, \r\nmandate-holders often speak of accountability, but \r\nthey must also show responsibility. They ask for \r\nopenness, but they must also provide balance. And \r\nmost importantly, they must inspire trust among all \r\nstakeholders, for the effective performance of the \r\nspecial procedures can be achieved only if there is trust \r\non the part of the States and all stakeholders concerned, \r\nand such trust can exist only when States are assured \r\nthat special procedures are faithful to and respectful of \r\ntheir mandates, as expressly defined by the resolutions \r\ncreating them.\r\nThe growing number of special procedures \r\nmandates, commissions of inquiry and fact-finding \r\nmissions, together with the multitude of resolutions \r\nadopted this year by the Human Rights Council, is \r\nillustrative of the increasing complexity and breadth \r\nof human rights issues in today’s world. Those are not \r\nstand-alone issues, but are interdependent, cross-cutting \r\nand part of what High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nPrince Ra’ad Zeid Al Hussein refers to as a complex \r\nweb of violations of economic, social, cultural, civil and \r\npolitical rights requiring solutions that can come only \r\nfrom more emphatic and comprehensive protection of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nWe could not agree more. Indeed, we must closely \r\nexamine and understand the hows and whys of these \r\ncrises so that we can learn to prevent and address them. \r\nOur delegation believes that the integration of human \r\nrights concerns into the shaping of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals is a step in that direction. Equally \r\ncritical is the fulfilment of the Council’s mandate to \r\npromote advisory services, technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building, in consultation with and with the \r\nconsent of States concerned.\r\nOn 8 November, the Philippines and the international \r\ncommunity marked the first-year anniversary of the \r\ndevastating typhoon Haiyan. We are thankful for the \r\ncontinuing assistance provided to us in the rebuilding of \r\nTacloban and the other areas destroyed by Haiyan. The \r\ntyphoon showed all of us the necessary link between \r\nsustainable development and human rights, and we \r\nwelcome in that regard the Human Rights Council’s \r\ndiscussions on the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, including the development of a repertoire of best \r\npractices, in post-disaster situations.\r\nAs the Philippines concludes its membership of the \r\nCouncil this year, we congratulate the newly elected \r\nmembers of the Council and wish them strength and \r\nfortitude as they continue the Council’s directive of \r\nhelping States build an enabling environment to better \r\npromote the human rights of their peoples.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): Egypt aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nMauritania on behalf of Group of African States. At \r\nthe outset, I wish to welcome Ambassador Baudelaire \r\nNdong Ella, President of the Human Rights Council, to \r\n26/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nthis debate on the report of the Council (see (A/69/53), \r\nin accordance with resolution 65/281.\r\nIn that resolution, the General Assembly affirmed \r\nthat the Council is a subsidiary organ of the Assembly, \r\nand that the discussion on the report of the Council \r\nshall take place in the Third Committee, where the \r\nPresident of the Council will present an annual briefing \r\non the report of the Council to the Committee, and a \r\nbriefing on the activities of the Council to the General \r\nAssembly. Although the resolution on the review of \r\nthe Council consolidated important practices and \r\nprinciples pertaining to the Council’s working methods \r\nand reaffirmed its subsidiary status, the adoption of the \r\nresolution by a recorded vote undermined, without a \r\ndoubt, the main objective of the Council, which is to \r\npromote respect for all human rights.\r\nThe Human Rights Council has an important role to \r\nplay in supporting the efforts of Member States, which \r\nhave the primary responsibility for the protection of all \r\nhuman rights. The Council should work to ensure the \r\npromotion and realization of those rights and provide \r\ngreatly needed support to national efforts. In this field, \r\nwhile maintaining a balanced approach to avoid the \r\nchallenges that hindered the work of the Commission \r\non Human Rights, such as politicization, selectivity and \r\ndouble standards, the annual report of the Council on \r\nits regular and special sessions presented in documents \r\nA/69/53 reaffirm that the Council plays an important \r\nrole in building national capacities, monitoring the \r\nhuman rights situation in the world and promoting \r\neconomic, social, cultural, civic and political rights on \r\nequal footing.\r\nThe Council has also played an important role \r\nwith regard to the protection of human rights of the \r\nPalestinian people and those living in the occupied \r\nArab territories, and strengthened the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to combat racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerances and to promote all \r\nhuman rights through the universal periodic review, the \r\ncomplaint mechanisms, the Forum on Minority Issues \r\nand mandate holders. The latter should carry out their \r\nduties and work in accordance with the clear mandates \r\ngiven to them by the Council and with full respect for \r\nthe Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate \r\nHolders of the Human Rights Council.\r\nDespite the efforts of the members of the Council \r\nduring its early years to work in accordance with \r\nthe principles of understanding, cooperation and \r\ntransparency, and to avoid confrontation, selectivity, \r\nand politicization in dealing with human rights issues, \r\nthose efforts seem to be waning and will result in the \r\nCouncil facing similar challenges to those faced by \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights in the past. We \r\nhave a responsibility to avoid repeating past mistakes \r\nby addressing the following important challenges: \r\npoliticization of Council resolutions that do not \r\nnecessarily conform to efforts to ensure respect for \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms; attempts \r\nto use the Council to uphold certain controversial \r\nnotions, such as sexual orientation and gender identity, \r\nin the absence of an international consensus in a bid \r\nto legitimize them; and systematic attempts to use \r\nthe Council as a tool to legitimize Security Council \r\ninterference in situations of human rights around the \r\nworld in a manner that undermines the effectiveness of \r\nthe role of the Human Rights Council and the roles of \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations as set forth \r\nin the Charter.\r\nSuch challenges are, inter alia, driving us away \r\nfrom cooperation and towards a path of confrontation. \r\nThe international community has the responsibility to \r\nensure that the Council carries out its responsibilities \r\nand functions within a transparent and cooperative \r\nframework, avoid turning the Council into a political \r\ntool to enforce the trusteeship of the few on human \r\nrights issues, or enforce controversial notions that have \r\nno legal foundations in international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights law in complete disregard of the diversity \r\nof social, cultural, legal and religious values of Member \r\nStates.\r\nEgypt reaffirms its commitment to supporting the \r\nwork of the Council to promote respect for all human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms by supporting the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations of the universal \r\nperiodic review by all States without distinction in \r\ncollaboration with non-governmental organizations and \r\ncivil society, by encouraging interaction of all States \r\nwith mandate-holders who should fully respect their \r\nmandates and the Code of Conduct, and by establishing \r\na dialogue with the Member States on the basis of \r\ntransparency and mutual cooperation. Furthermore, \r\nthe international community has a responsibility to \r\nstrengthen the role of the Council by ensuring the full \r\ncooperation of all Member States.\r\nMs. Murillo (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council for his \r\nbriefing and welcome the report on the essential work \r\nperformed by this body (A/69/53). Costa Rica is pleased \r\n14-63039 27/28\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.52\r\nwith the progressive consolidation of the Council, the \r\nfulfilment of its mandates and the strengthening of its \r\nworking methods.\r\nMy country has had the honour of being a member of \r\nthe Council for the period 2011-2014 and has contributed \r\nto its strengthening by actively participating in the \r\nforging of purposeful partnerships with countries from \r\ndifferent regions, fostering dialogue in negotiations \r\nand helping to build agreements. Our participation has \r\nbeen based on our deep conviction that the vision set \r\nforth by General Assembly in 2006 when it created the \r\nHuman Rights Council — to endow a body responsible \r\nfor promoting universal respect for and protection of all \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind and in a fair and \r\nequitable manner, guided by impartiality, objectivity, \r\nnon-selectivity, dialogue and cooperation — should be \r\nrealized. The Council was created to serve as a forum \r\nfor dialogue on thematic issues on all human rights, to \r\nmaintain a system of special procedures, expert advice \r\nand a complaint procedure, and to address situations in \r\nwhich human rights are violated, in particular through \r\nserious and systematic violations.\r\nIn order to strengthen Member States’ capacities \r\nto fulfil their obligations with regard to human rights, \r\nbased on the principles of cooperation and constructive \r\ninternational dialogue, we note with satisfaction the \r\nprogress seen in the universal periodic review (UPR) \r\nmechanism, which puts all States on an equal footing \r\nby analysing their situation in that area. The exercise \r\nenhances dialogue, the sharing of good practices and \r\ncan help improve human rights in all Member States, if \r\nused constructively.\r\nConvinced of the importance of the UPR, my \r\ncountry has contributed to its ongoing validity by \r\nactively participating in more than 100 sessions and by \r\nmaking constructive and respectful recommendations. \r\nFurthermore, in May we presented the results of our \r\nsecond UPR, which we considered to be an opportunity \r\nfor accountability and assess progress and challenges as \r\na nation. The preparation of the UPR was done within \r\nthe framework of the Inter-agency Commission for \r\nMonitoring and Implementation of International Human \r\nRights Obligations, which comprises 21 institutions \r\nof the executive branch of our national Government, \r\nrepresentatives of the judiciary, the legislature, the \r\nSupreme Electoral Tribunal and the Office of the \r\nOmbudsperson, which was a step forward in terms of \r\nstrengthening inter-agency coordination and dialogue \r\nwith civil society.\r\nWithout undermining the importance of the UPR, \r\nas stated, the Council also has the responsibility to \r\nlook into specific situations that, by their seriousness, \r\nrequire a particular, country-specific approach. \r\nTherefore, we actively participate in the negotiation of \r\ncountry resolutions and in special meetings convened \r\nin the context of special sessions.\r\nDuring its membership of the Council, Costa Rica \r\nhas promoted important initiatives for human rights. \r\nWe continue our traditional work in human rights \r\neducation and, for the past three years, we have been \r\nworking in conjunction with the Platform for Human \r\nRights Education and Training, in order to promote \r\ncontinuity with the Global Programme in that area. \r\nWe are gradually outlining the approach of the third \r\nphase of the Programme for 2015-2019, dedicated to \r\njournalists and other media workers, with a view to \r\napproving the plan of action during the session last \r\nSeptember.\r\nWe have also been taking the lead on other \r\nimportant Council resolutions, such as those on the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights in the \r\ncontext of peaceful demonstrations, on which we are \r\nworking with Switzerland and Turkey; on conscientious \r\nobjection to military service, with Croatia and Poland; \r\nand on the establishment of a special rapporteur on \r\nhuman rights and the environment, with such countries \r\nas Switzerland, Slovenia, the Philippines and Maldives.\r\nSimilarly, Costa Rica has been intensely involved \r\nin several working groups and processes. We actively \r\nparticipate in the review process of the work and \r\nfunctioning of the Council, which signalled a new \r\nstage in the work of that body. We have also shown \r\nleadership in and contributed to the consolidation of the \r\ncomplaint mechanism, occupying the chairmanship of \r\nthe Working Group on Situations for two years, during \r\nwhich we introduced group decisions by consensus, \r\nheld periodic information sessions on the functioning \r\nof our discussions, and institutionalized an annual \r\nexchange meeting with the Advisory Group’s Working \r\nGroup on Communications.\r\nCosta Rica also assumed the chairmanship of the \r\nworking group tasked with drafting a declaration on the \r\nright to peace. That process has continued to develop \r\nin a favourable manner. A new dynamic of trust has \r\nevolved that has strengthened dialogue, and links to \r\n28/28 14-63039\r\nA/69/PV.52 17/11/2014\r\nacademia have been established that have also yielded \r\nnew contributions. We are working on reaching a \r\ncommon understanding in order to finalize the process \r\nand the draft proposal for the declaration.\r\nOur country is a good example of the way in \r\nwhich the Council’s special procedures help to advance \r\nhuman rights. With respect to the past triennium, we \r\nshould take special note of the cooperation we received \r\nfrom the former Special Rapporteur on the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples, James Anaya. Mr. Anaya made \r\na number of visits and supported State authorities \r\nand the indigenous peoples of Costa Rica in the \r\nconsultative process regarding a hydroelectric dam in \r\nthe south of our country. As a result, an open forum was \r\nestablished; work continues on the bases established in \r\nthose talks. Moreover, in 2013 we received a visit from \r\nthe Independent Expert on the issue of human rights \r\nobligations relating to the enjoyment of a safe, clean, \r\nhealthy and sustainable environment, whose mandate, \r\nas I have already stated, we support. Costa Rica also \r\nhighly values the assistance of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, with whose support \r\nwe developed our national policy for a society free of \r\nracism, racial discrimination and xenophobia.\r\nFinally, we call on all Member States to demonstrate \r\ntheir commitment to the Council as a central organ of \r\nthe Organization on the issue of human rights and to \r\nsafeguard its important work.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
