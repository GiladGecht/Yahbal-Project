"*1463478*\r\n14-63478 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.50 p.m. \r\nAgenda item 63 (continued)\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/69/53 \r\nand A/69/53/Add.1)\r\nMr. Kydyrov (Kyrgyzstan): First of all, I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to express our appreciation \r\nto Mr. Baudelaire Ndong Ella, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, for introducing the Council’s \r\ncomprehensive report (A/69/53).\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic firmly agrees with the need \r\nfor universal recognition of, and respect for, human \r\nrights as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other \r\nbasic international instruments. The provisions of \r\nthe Constitution of the Kyrgyz Republic specify \r\nthat fundamental freedoms and human rights are to \r\ndetermine the meaning and content of the activities \r\nof the legislative and executive authorities and local \r\nGovernments.\r\nIn the context of globalization and new challenges, \r\nKyrgyzstan favours the further strengthening of \r\ninternational cooperation and effective action by the \r\nUnited Nations and its agencies in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. Kyrgyzstan commends the \r\nprogress achieved by the Human Rights Council, which \r\nhas demonstrated itself to be a unique platform for the \r\ndiscussion and development of recommendations and \r\nstandards in the field of human rights and for providing \r\ntechnical assistance. At the same time, we consider it \r\ncrucial to strictly enforce the principles of universality, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.\r\nIn our opinion, the Human Rights Council \r\nshould focus more attention on assistance aimed at \r\ncapacity-building at the country level, particularly \r\nin the development and implementation of national \r\nprogrammes. In that regard, it is important to focus on \r\nareas such as the right to development and economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights. We also advocate the \r\npromotion of the rule of law at the national and global \r\nlevels, and ensuring respect for human rights and fair \r\njustice through an independent judiciary.\r\nWe should always remember that the problems \r\nof human rights, the rule of law and democracy are \r\ninterlinked and mutually reinforcing. It is therefore \r\nnecessary to develop comprehensive measures and \r\nreflect them in development strategies and programmes, \r\nincluding those related to the post-2015 period.\r\nThe Assembly will recall that on 21 October it \r\nelected 15 new States members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2015-2017 (see A/69/PV.29). \r\nI would like to take this opportunity sincerely to \r\ncongratulate them on their election to the Council and \r\nto express confidence that they will make a valuable \r\ncontribution to its work during this challenging period.\r\nKyrgyzstan was previously elected as a member of \r\nthe Human Rights Council for the period 2009-2012, \r\nincluding as Vice-President and Rapporteur of the \r\nBureau of the Council. We express our readiness to \r\ncontinue actively participating in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.54\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n54th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 17 November 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

In that connection, Kyrgyzstan has presented \r\nits candidature for membership to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2016-2018. If elected to the \r\nCouncil, Kyrgyzstan will make every effort to apply \r\nits acquired experience in promoting dialogue and \r\nconstructive cooperation among all interested States, \r\ntaking into account national and regional developments \r\nand the cultural, historic and religious traditions of \r\nStates and the sustainable development goals for the \r\npost-2015 period.\r\nThe current global situation demonstrates the \r\nincreasing role of international agencies in the field of the \r\nprotection of human rights, including the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR), in the maintenance of peace, security and \r\nstability. Kyrgyzstan supports the activities of OHCHR \r\nand advocates its improved efficiency and constructive \r\ncooperation with the Human Rights Council, especially \r\nin the implementation of programmes to strengthen the \r\ncapacities of countries in promoting the observance of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Boureima (Niger), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nWe consider the universal periodic review (UPR) \r\nthe most effective mechanism for strengthening \r\ninternational cooperation in the protection of human \r\nrights. The voluntary implementation of the outcome of \r\nthe UPR is assisting in promoting the advancement of \r\nhuman rights in all Member States.\r\nIn that regard, we should note the positive work \r\nof the Council in ensuring the universal nature of the \r\nUPR, which is important for effective action in the \r\nhuman rights area. At the same time, further attention \r\nis needed to assist countries in the implementation \r\nof the recommendations of the universal periodic \r\nreview through the provision of technical assistance \r\nin accordance with national priorities in the field of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nKyrgyzstan presented its first national report \r\nunder the universal periodic review process in 2010. \r\nSubsequently, 154 out of the 168 UPR recommendations \r\nwere adopted as voluntary commitments. Today, the \r\npreparation of the second national report under the \r\nUPR has been completed. In general, over the past four \r\nyears, Kyrgyzstan has presented six periodic reports to \r\nUnited Nations treaty bodies.\r\nHowever, the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights remains a challenge, especially for the least \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, owing largely to \r\nthe lack of resources to support appropriate institutions \r\nand mechanisms needed for further reforms. It is \r\nnecessary to take that factor into account within \r\nthe framework of the Council’s activities and the \r\nmultilateral partnerships among member States.\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again reiterate our \r\nstrong commitment to contribute to the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council in ensuring the maintenance \r\nof international standards and the strengthening of \r\nmultilateral cooperation in the field of human rights.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI would also like to thank and congratulate the \r\nAmbassador of Gabon to Geneva and President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for his work. I wish to refer \r\nin particular to an issue that he highlighted in his \r\nstatement in this morning’s meeting (see A/69/PV.52), \r\nnamely, the political manipulation that increasingly \r\nburdens the work of the Human Rights Council.\r\nThe Human Rights Council was established \r\nto overcome the double standards, confrontational \r\nposture and political manipulations of the Commission \r\non Human Rights. However, that same Council \r\ntoday needs to be rescued from the selectivity and \r\nmanipulation that has characterized its work in dealing \r\nwith country situations. That is clear from the various \r\ninitiatives adopted by the Council during the reporting \r\nperiod now before the Assembly.\r\nThat is the reality we confront, when respectful \r\ndialogue and cooperation should be guiding the \r\nwork of that body. Rather than promoting efforts to \r\nstrengthen the universal periodic review mechanism \r\nas the primary tool for the comprehensive analysis \r\nof countries’ human-rights situations, confrontation, \r\ncoercion and even the promotion of sanctions against \r\nsovereign States are favoured.\r\nThere is an attempt to stigmatize developing \r\ncountries, without even allowing them an opportunity \r\nto defend themselves. Punishment is meted out based \r\non unverified allegations about the situation on the \r\nground. It is unacceptable that one of the resolutions \r\nadopted by the Council seeks to impose the precedent \r\nand, of course, the practice of manipulating the \r\nprocedures established by the Council to fabricate \r\npretexts for punishment and sanctions through referrals \r\nto the Security Council and the International Criminal \r\nCourt, a body where the powerful are invariably and \r\nalways guaranteed impunity.\r\n14-63478 3/14\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.54\r\nCuba will actively reject such a serious precedent. \r\nWhat is at play are rights as sacred as the right to \r\nself-determination, the right to peace and the right to \r\ndevelopment for all peoples and countries of the South. \r\nNeglecting that would transform us into accomplices \r\nof a practice that will in future threaten all developing \r\ncountries and all those lacking the protections \r\nguaranteed to the powerful through impunity — all of \r\nthe vulnerable and all of those who are oppressed by \r\nthe power elites.\r\nCuba will continue to promote constructive \r\ndialogue and respect for the principles of universality, \r\nobjectivity, impartiality and non-selectivity. We \r\nwill continue to defend the special procedures and \r\nmechanisms of the Council established to promote such \r\ncooperation, and we will continue to work to prevent \r\nthem from becoming tools for political manipulation on \r\nthe basis of certain hegemonic interests.\r\nCuba will continue to work for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, the human rights of peoples, \r\nthe rights of the third generation and the right to food, \r\nand to work for the establishment of a democratic and \r\nequitable international order. Cuba will also continue \r\nto work for the promotion of the right to international \r\nsolidarity and for the fight against racism, xenophobia \r\nand all forms of discrimination. We will continue to \r\nwork to achieve cultural rights and respect for diversity.\r\nIn short, Cuba will continue to be committed to \r\nensuring that a world where human rights for all is no \r\nlonger a pipe dream.\r\nMr. Sinjaree (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): Our \r\ndelegation would like to take this opportunity to \r\nwelcome the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nwho was with us this morning and briefed the Assembly \r\nabout the activities of the Human Rights Council over \r\nthe past year (see A/69/PV.52). We would also like to \r\nthank him for his personal activities and for his success \r\nin carrying out his duties as President of the Council. \r\nOur delegation has reviewed the report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/69/53) and appreciates the efforts \r\nthat went into its preparation.\r\nAfter the terrorist attacks that Iraq suffered in \r\nvarious areas on 10 June, namely, the control over parts \r\nof Iraq by the terrorist gangs of the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL), the violations that took \r\nplace alongside those attacks carried out by those \r\nbarbaric gangs, namely, killings, forced expulsions, \r\nespecially of minorities, massacres of captive soldiers \r\nand other Iraqi prisoners, the detention of women and \r\nall forms of violations against those women, Iraqis have \r\nsought to expose those crimes before the international \r\ncommunity and international human rights forums. \r\nIraq called for a special session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the twenty-second special session, which \r\nresulted in the issuing of Council resolution 22/1, \r\nagreed upon by consensus. The resolution reflects the \r\nsupport of the international community for Iraq’s efforts \r\nin confronting those terrorist groups; the international \r\ncommunity also urged greater efforts to assist Iraq to \r\nprotect its civilians and provide assistance for them.\r\nUnder that resolution, the Human Rights Council \r\nasks the Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights to send a special team to Iraq to investigate \r\nallegations of violations of international human rights \r\nlaw by the ISIL terrorist gangs, as well as to establish \r\na fact-finding mission into those violations in order to \r\navoid any impunity. In that context, Iraq reiterates its \r\ncomplete readiness to cooperate with the team and the \r\nmission of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\nand hopes that they will achieve their objectives within \r\nthe limits of their mandate.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to express our gratitude to \r\nall countries that have assisted and supported Iraq in \r\nits efforts to hold that special session, to the States that \r\nhave supported the draft resolution that was eventually \r\nissued, and all States that have backed military, \r\ntechnical and humanitarian support for Iraq in its fight \r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): I would \r\nfirst like to pay a special tribute to His Excellency \r\nMr. Baudelaire Ndong Ella, President of the Human \r\nRights Council, and to congratulate him for his \r\nleadership and for the outstanding skill with which he \r\nled the work of the Council during this year, including \r\nthe dynamism that he has brought to the activities of the \r\nCouncil during his presidency.\r\nThe international community is preparing to \r\ncelebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, which has become the main \r\nUnited Nations body responsible for human rights issues. \r\nWith dialogue, cooperation and technical assistance as \r\nthe basis of its work, the Council has been successful in \r\nobtaining the commitment and cooperation of several \r\nStates. Furthermore, its innovative mechanism, the \r\nuniversal periodic review, has shown that universality \r\nand cooperation remain the key for promoting and \r\neffectively protecting human rights. For their part, the \r\n4/14 14-63478\r\nA/69/PV.54 17/11/2014\r\nspecial procedures continue to play an indispensable \r\nrole in informing the Council of developments in the \r\nfield of human rights around the world and in providing \r\nit with the necessary expertise on thematic issues.\r\nThe international community has therefore the \r\nduty to protect the achievements of the Council and \r\nto preserve the Council’s work from politicization and \r\ninstrumentalization.\r\nAs we are aware of the need to strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations system in the field of human rights, \r\nMorocco was committed, from the very beginning, to \r\nthe process of establishing the Human Rights Council \r\nin 2005. Morocco’s modest contribution culminated \r\nin the establishment of the universal periodic review \r\nmechanism, of which it was the architect through the \r\nrole that my country assumed as a facilitator of that \r\nmechanism, both during the process of its creation in \r\n2006 and 2007, and during the process of review of its \r\noperation and its methods of work in 2011.\r\nMorocco’s interest in strengthening the Council \r\nand its mechanisms has also manifested itself in the \r\nactions that it has taken within this past year aimed \r\nat providing the Council with the necessary means to \r\nenable it to fully carry out its mandate. To that end, \r\nMorocco, along with a group of countries, launched an \r\ninitiative that led to the creation of a voluntary fund \r\nfor the participation of the least-developed countries \r\nand the small island developing States in the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council. The noble objective of that \r\ninitiative is to guarantee the principle of universality and \r\nthe equality of States by assisting countries that do not \r\npossess the necessary resources to actively participate \r\nin the work of the Council. My delegation is gratified \r\nby the launch of the fund by the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights. My delegation especially welcomes the \r\nfact that a number of countries have already benefited \r\nfrom financing from the fund. Within the framework of \r\nour commitment to those countries, Morocco will host \r\na training seminar next month, which will be organized \r\nin the framework of the fund. Representatives from \r\nFrench-speaking least-developed countries and small \r\nisland developing States will benefit from it.\r\nIn the framework of our commitment to \r\nstrengthening the Human Rights Council, Morocco, \r\nalong with a number of countries, is undertaking an \r\ninitiative at several levels at the United Nations to \r\nstrengthen the financial resources available to the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, especially in \r\nimplementing activities mandated by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The aim is to have those activities covered by \r\nthe regular budget of the United Nations in order to \r\nguarantee the fulfilment of the mandate of the Council \r\nin full independence.\r\nA joint declaration to that end was read before the \r\nHuman Rights Council in 2012. It was followed by a \r\nletter addressed by the Ambassadors of our countries \r\nto the Secretary-General. It is my pleasure to announce \r\nthat Morocco will this week read out in the Fifth \r\nCommittee a joint statement on behalf of our group \r\nof States. We encourage all delegations to lend their \r\nsupport to the joint statement.\r\nThe Human Rights Council continues to face \r\nbarriers to the implementation of its mandate. That is \r\nwhy a balanced, vigilant and victim-centred approach \r\nto tackling the emerging human rights problems facing \r\nthe world is ever more necessary.\r\nThe growing importance of human rights in \r\ninternational relations calls for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to be very active and show greater visibility. \r\nHowever, the Human Rights Council is rarely mentioned \r\nby the media and, if it is mentioned, it is represented \r\ninaccurately. That body should do more to ensure the \r\nvisibility of its work. It is therefore time, in our view, \r\nfor the Council to adopt a communication strategy \r\nthat adequately reflects its work in advocating for, \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. With greater \r\nvisibility, the Council will have greater impact on the \r\nground and will contribute further to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights.\r\nFurthermore, it is inconceivable that the Council is \r\nseized annually with more than 100 draft resolutions in \r\naddition to the growing number of special procedures \r\nand panels, which are a burden on the Council’s working \r\ncapacity and prevent delegations from following and \r\ncontributing effectively and constructively to all of its \r\nwork. Considerable efforts should therefore be made \r\nto lighten the workload of the Human Rights Council, \r\nspecifically through a genuine effort to streamline its \r\nworking methods and mechanisms.\r\nFinally, the members of the Human Rights Council \r\nmust resist attempts to deflect it from the mandate \r\nentrusted to it by the General Assembly, so as to \r\nsafeguard its achievements and ensure the effectiveness \r\nof its action.\r\nMy delegation underscores the important role of \r\ncivil society in the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights. It provides valuable support to the efforts of \r\n14-63478 5/14\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.54\r\nStates and helps to strengthen respect for human \r\nrights on the ground. In recognition of the role of \r\ncivil-society bodies, Morocco incorporated that role \r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights into \r\nits Constitution of 2011. Morocco’s openness to those \r\nimportant actors in human rights earned us significant \r\nrecognition, including our designation as host of the \r\nsecond World Forum on Human Rights, which will \r\ntake place from 27 to 30 November in Marrakesh, with \r\nthe participation of more than 5,000 governmental and \r\nnon-governmental actors.\r\nThe Forum represents international recognition \r\nof the Kingdom’s achievements in that field and \r\nthe vitality of national institutions and civil society \r\norganizations working in the field of human rights. My \r\ncountry is honoured by the trust placed in us by the \r\nnon-governmental organizations of the world and will \r\nmake every effort to ensure the full success of their \r\nglobal forum.\r\nI would like to conclude by recalling the \r\ncommitment of Morocco to promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms at the national \r\nand international levels alike, including through the \r\nHuman Rights Council. As a founding member of \r\nthe Council that also serves on it, Morocco will spare \r\nno effort to uphold its principles and objectives and \r\nenhance its efficiency and effectiveness.\r\nMr. Šćepanović (Montenegro): At the outset, let \r\nme thank the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nAmbassador Baudelaire Ndong Ella, for presenting the \r\nCouncil’s ninth annual report to the General Assembly \r\n(A/69/53). We appreciate the opportunity to interact \r\nwith the President of the Council and the dialogue \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly.\r\nMontenegro aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered on behalf of the European Union (see \r\nA/69/PV.52).\r\nThe Human Rights Council has undoubtedly \r\nbecome an important venue for addressing international \r\ncrises and finding global solutions to tough challenges \r\nas they unfold. While all Human Rights Council \r\nmember States make strengthening the credibility and \r\neffectiveness of the multilateral human rights system \r\na priority, I would like to emphasize once again that \r\nMontenegro will maximize its efforts towards that end. \r\nAs human rights are one of the fundamental pillars \r\nof the United Nations system, the Government of \r\nMontenegro recognizes the necessity of supporting the \r\nCouncil in fulfilling its mandate.\r\nWe applaud the Human Rights Council’s proactive \r\nand leading role in dealing with crisis situations and \r\ngross violations of human rights in all corners of \r\nthe world. The Human Rights Council has achieved \r\nsignificant progress in dealing with human rights issues \r\nacross the globe since its establishment eight years ago. \r\nThe contribution of the Human Rights Council is even \r\nmore important and relevant in situations where the \r\nSecurity Council is unable to provide a timely response \r\nto a pressing emergency. In that regard, we commend \r\nand strongly support the establishment and the work of \r\nthe various commissions of inquiry that collect, despite \r\nall of the difficulties encountered, detailed accounts \r\nof violations. We appreciate their continuing efforts to \r\nilluminate deteriorating situations.\r\nMontenegro will persist in advocating for full \r\naccountability for all violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Montenegro also \r\nreaffirms its support for comprehensive political \r\nsolutions as the best way to stop atrocities and ensure \r\nrespect for all human rights. We therefore encourage all \r\nparties to reject violence and participate constructively \r\nin an inclusive peace process.\r\nGiven that the universal periodic review is meant \r\nto be an efficient instrument for a transparent and \r\nobjective assessment of the human-rights situation in \r\neach Member State, we feel compelled to contribute to \r\nthat positive result. The activities involved are activities \r\nthat we cannot and do not implement individually. \r\nTherefore, the involvement and cooperation of all \r\nstakeholders — the Human Rights Council, special \r\nprocedures, non-governmental organizations and other \r\nState and non-State actors — will be of the utmost \r\nimportance. Allow me to stress that the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) also plays a vital role in encouraging States \r\nand providing them with assistance to meet their \r\nprotection responsibilities.\r\nAt this point, I would like to emphasize that \r\nMontenegro has extended a standing invitation to all \r\nspecial procedures, as we are firmly convinced of their \r\ncrucial role in advancing the human-rights agenda. \r\nBy doing so, we have demonstrated our commitment \r\nto cooperate and respect the highest standard of \r\nprotection. In that regard, we expect all Member States \r\nto follow the same path.\r\n6/14 14-63478\r\nA/69/PV.54 17/11/2014\r\nI would like in particular to voice my concern about \r\nthe shortfalls in the funding of the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. Allow me to recall \r\nthat Montenegro was one of more than 50 countries \r\nthat called on the Secretary-General to recommend \r\nthat a larger proportion of the United Nations regular \r\nbudget be devoted to the OHCHR, given the significant \r\nand continuing growth in the volume of the Office’s \r\nactivities. Bearing in mind the surge of interest in \r\nhuman rights — reflected, inter alia, in the proliferation \r\nof new mechanisms and mandates, human rights treaty \r\nbodies and treaty body experts and resolutions adopted \r\nby the Council — we strongly believe that the funding \r\ndeficit should be addressed as a matter of priority in \r\norder not to compromise the capacity of OHCHR to \r\ncarry out its complex mandate.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nlet me reiterate our genuine commitment to further \r\nadvancing the human-rights agenda and ensuring the \r\nimplementation of international human rights norms \r\nand standards.\r\nMs. Diaz Gras (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico welcomes the report (A/69/53) introduced \r\nthis morning by the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Ndong Ella (see A/69/PV.52), \r\nand appreciates the effort and dedication he has shown \r\nin the conduct of his duties. Since Mexico assumed \r\nits membership in the Human Rights Council in \r\nJanuary 2014, its participation has been governed by \r\nthe principles of universality, non-selectivity, balance \r\nand the promotion of cooperation. My delegation \r\nrecognizes the need to promote greater cooperation \r\nand dialogue among regions in order to facilitate the \r\nintroduction of new issues of common interest on the \r\nbasis of consensus. We believe that the President’s \r\nrole in the work of the Council is critical to building \r\nalliances and understanding among regional groups, a \r\ntask to which my country reiterates its support.\r\nWe believe that it is important to strengthen the \r\nCouncil’s effectiveness and improve its coordination \r\nwith other bodies of the United Nations system, \r\nparticularly in preventing human rights crises. In that \r\nrespect, it is crucial to take advantage of the analyses \r\nand reports produced by the various special procedures \r\nof the Human Rights Council to identify critical \r\nhuman rights situations and act in a timely fashion. \r\nFurthermore, we believe that the Council should \r\ncapitalize on innovative tools such as the universal \r\nperiodic review (UPR) mechanism. It is important to \r\npromote a greater exchange of experiences, common \r\nchallenges and cooperation among countries within the \r\ncontext of the UPR working group meetings, so that \r\nthat important exercise can have sufficient impact on \r\nimproving the human rights situation on the ground. \r\nAnother important tool, which has been expanded and \r\nimproved within the framework of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, is the cooperation and technical assistance \r\noffered by the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. In that respect, we \r\nconsider it necessary to find a more efficient use of \r\nexisting mechanisms in the Council, particularly the \r\nspecial procedures, in order to respond to the need to \r\nmonitor, investigate and provide technical advice in \r\nurgent human rights situations.\r\nMexico reiterates the commitment of States to \r\nprovide the Human Rights Council with the necessary \r\ntools to fulfil its mandate, and we must recognize the \r\nlegitimacy of its decisions at all times. Likewise, we \r\nreiterate once again the need to provide the Office of \r\nthe High Commissioner for Human Rights with the \r\nnecessary resources so that it can adequately fulfil its \r\nmandate, based on the responsibilities that member \r\nStates have conferred on it. My delegation reiterates \r\nits commitment to the work done by the Council as \r\nthe most important body of the Organization devoted \r\nto carrying out the delicate tasks of promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights around the world. Mexico will \r\ncontinue to participate constructively in support of the \r\nimplementation of its mandate.\r\nMr. Elbahi (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Our \r\ndelegation has listened to the briefing by the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council (see A/69/PV.52) and has \r\nreviewed the Council’s report (A/69/53), which covers \r\nits activities and meetings for the first half of this year. \r\nWe highly appreciate the presence this morning of the \r\nPresident of the Council, as well as his briefing to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAt the outset, our delegation aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of \r\nMauritania on behalf of the Group of African States \r\n(see A/69/PV.52).\r\nWe should also like to state that the Sudan has \r\nratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights; the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights; the International Convention on the \r\nElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the \r\nConvention against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, \r\nInhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; the \r\n14-63478 7/14\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.54\r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child and its two \r\nProtocols; the International Convention on the Rights \r\nof Persons with Disabilities; the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide; \r\nand the Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 \r\n(No. 183) of the International Labour Organization. We \r\nare also proud to support all international human rights \r\nmechanisms, including those of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, as presented by the President of the Human \r\nRights Council last September in Geneva. We call \r\nupon the United Nations and other donors to fulfil their \r\nobligations as indicated in the recent Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolutions related to technical assistance \r\nand capacity-building. We welcome the appointment \r\nof the new independent expert and we reiterate our \r\nwillingness to cooperate with him in accordance with \r\nhis important mandate.\r\nMy country has adopted policies, programmes \r\nand strategies aimed at promoting and supporting \r\nhuman rights in the Sudan. In that context, we would \r\nlike to remind the Assembly of the following national \r\nachievements.\r\nFirst, we have established an independent \r\ncommission on human rights in accord with the Paris \r\nPrinciples, and it has been in operation for more than \r\nthree years now.\r\nSecondly, we have created an entire justice system \r\nfor juvenile rights, including a special law for children, \r\nwhile providing training for judges and specialists. \r\nIn implementation of that law, we have created the \r\nNational Council for the Support of Children.\r\nThirdly, over three years ago, we created a special \r\ntribunal for Darfur and appointed a General Prosecutor. \r\nSince its establishment, the tribunal has begun its work \r\nand has been receiving complaints and cases from \r\nvictims.\r\nFourthly, our armed and security forces and police \r\nlaw very clearly specifies the illegality of recruiting \r\nchildren under 18. We have established child-protection \r\nunits and family-protection units within the armed \r\nforces and police, as well as units to combat violence \r\nagainst women and young girls.\r\nFifthly, the Sudan has adopted a law on disabilities \r\nand a law against human trafficking, especially of \r\nwomen and children. In October, we hosted a regional \r\nconference to combat trafficking in persons in the \r\nHorn of Africa with broad, high-level regional and \r\ninternational participation.\r\nVarious social groups and entities have participated \r\nrecently in the national dialogue initiatives started by \r\nthe President of the Sudan in order to address all issues \r\nand concerns of national interest and of concern to the \r\nstability of the country. We hope that the outcome of \r\nthat initiative will be positive and good for the future \r\nof the people of the Sudan and strengthen its enjoyment \r\nof all its rights.\r\nWe reaffirm that the universality and indivisibility \r\nof human rights means that all human rights should \r\nbe addressed equally with the same level of attention \r\nwithout differentiation. We call upon members to \r\npay attention to economic, social and cultural rights \r\nand the right to development on the same level as \r\ncivic and political rights. We also emphasize that \r\naddressing human rights should be done on the basis \r\nof constructive cooperation in line with the promotion \r\nof, and support for, human rights, while avoiding the \r\npoliticization of those rights in a way that does not \r\nviolate the sovereignty of the State as the primary party \r\nresponsible for the protection of those rights.\r\nOur delegation insistently calls for the international \r\ncommunity to confront and end the attempts by some to \r\nexport novel sexual concepts in a way that completely \r\ndisregards the particular specificities and religious \r\nnorms and cultural traditions of various countries and \r\nsocieties, given the importance of the norm that the \r\nfamily is the most important element.\r\nThere are many new issues that require the tripartite \r\ncooperation of the Human Rights Council, the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights and other stakeholders and mechanisms, on one \r\nside, as well as horizontal cooperation between States, \r\non the other, rather than having some States appoint \r\nthemselves judges and evaluators of the human rights \r\nsituations in other States.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation calls for the adoption \r\nof a comprehensive approach to human rights issues \r\naround the world that takes into consideration \r\ndevelopment and support for developing States, while \r\neliminating unilateral sanctions imposed on them, \r\nlifting restrictions on their exports and addressing \r\nthe effects of climate change, in order to enable \r\nthem to meet all their obligations in protecting and \r\ndefending human rights. We also urge for support for \r\nand protection of the Palestinian people in the face of \r\nthe continuing violations of their human rights by the \r\nIsraeli occupying authorities.\r\n8/14 14-63478\r\nA/69/PV.54 17/11/2014\r\nMr. Hoem (Norway): Norway would like to thank \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nBaudelaire Ndong Ella, for the way in which he has \r\npresided over the Council in 2014 and for presenting \r\nthis year’s annual report (A/69/53) this morning (see \r\nA/69/PV.52). The Human Rights Council has continued \r\nto be relevant and to show its ability to make important \r\ndecisions. Cross-regional agreements and alliances \r\nincrease the Council’s relevance and credibility, and \r\nthat way of conducting its business has become the \r\nrule rather than the exception. On several potentially \r\ncontentious issues, the Council has managed to achieve \r\nconsensus.\r\nThis year, Norway negotiated the extension of two \r\nmandates in the Council. We were grateful for the record \r\nnumber of countries, from all regions, that sponsored \r\nthe March resolution extending the mandate of the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of \r\nthe right to freedom of opinion and expression. We also \r\nthank States for their support in achieving consensus \r\non extending the mandate of the working group on the \r\nissue of human rights and transnational corporations \r\nand other business enterprises, through a resolution \r\nthat also addressed important issues such as remedies \r\nfor victims of human rights abuses inflicted by States \r\nand businesses. We were glad to see that several other \r\nresolutions adopted this year also include language \r\non protecting human rights defenders, condemning \r\nreprisals and widening the space for civil society.\r\nUnfortunately, in several places around the world \r\nsuch gains in the normative sphere of the Council \r\nhave not translated into an improved situation for \r\ncivil society and human rights defenders, and in many \r\ncountries their space is shrinking. We are also shocked \r\nto note that threats, attacks and acts of intimidation \r\ncontinue against many who have cooperated or sought \r\nto cooperate with the United Nations, including \r\nthrough the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms. \r\nReprisals cause pain and suffering, violate the rights of \r\nindividuals and undermine the credibility of the United \r\nNations and its ability to carry out its work. As such, \r\nthey represent an attack on the very institution that \r\nwe have built here together. Such shameful practices \r\ndemand a firmer response from the United Nations and \r\nits States Members. We acknowledge the role of the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council in dealing with \r\nsuch issues, and the need to take a principled and vocal \r\nstance. We also have high expectations of the General \r\nAssembly in that regard, and we urge that the Council’s \r\nimportant resolution 24/24 of last year on reprisals be \r\nspeedily implemented. I would like to emphasize in \r\nthat regard the important point just made today by the \r\nrepresentative of Morocco on enhancing the visibility \r\nof the Council and its decisions.\r\nWe were very pleased that the Council adopted a \r\nresolution on sexual orientation and gender identity in \r\nSeptember. Only the second such resolution in history, \r\nit was adopted with a large majority, gaining support \r\nfrom new countries. We thank Colombia, Uruguay, \r\nBrazil and Chile for their leadership.\r\nThe universal periodic review (UPR) still \r\nmaintains a 100 per cent participation rate by States. \r\nThis year, Norway was one of the countries to undergo \r\nthe review, and we again found it very helpful in \r\naddressing important issues and guiding human rights \r\nimplementation in our country.\r\nAs a complement to the UPR mechanism, the \r\nCouncil proved once again that it does not shy away \r\nfrom tackling serious human rights situations when \r\nnecessary. In 2014, that included an African-led \r\ninitiative to establish a commission of inquiry on Eritrea \r\nand a cross-regional effort to establish an investigation \r\nof Sri Lanka led by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), as \r\nwell as three special sessions. We also saw a steady \r\ndemand for country-specific resolutions and initiatives \r\nfrom States on their own situations, attesting to the \r\nCouncil’s growing positive reputation and its ability to \r\nset in motion action in support of countries’ own efforts \r\nto promote human rights.\r\nNorway is concerned about the Council’s limited \r\nresources for delivering on its workload as it takes \r\non an increasing number of issues and creates an \r\nunprecedented number of new mandates. The ability of \r\nthe Council’s secretariat, OHCHR and States to follow \r\nup is not developing at the same pace. The chronic \r\nunderfunding of human rights, one of the three main \r\npillars of the United Nations, is well known. The 3 per \r\ncent of the regular budget of the United Nations that \r\nit receives is so unsustainable that OHCHR, instead \r\nof expanding, is now having to cut posts. The States \r\nMembers of the United Nations have a responsibility to \r\nensure that OHCHR, a key institution for promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights in the United Nations system \r\nand supporting the Human Rights Council, can fulfil \r\nits mandate in the light of the increasing demands.\r\nFinally, Norway continues to be disappointed by \r\nthe fact that the annual resolution on the Human Rights \r\n14-63478 9/14\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.54\r\nCouncil’s report is still being presented to the Third \r\nCommittee rather than the plenary of the General \r\nAssembly. In accordance with resolution 65/281, on \r\nthe review of the Council, it is up to the Assembly, not \r\nthe Third Committee, to take action on the Council’s \r\nimportant report.\r\nMr. Kohona (Sri Lanka): I thank the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council for presenting its \r\nreport (A/69/53). Sri Lanka recognizes the important \r\ncontribution that the Council can make to protecting \r\nand promoting human rights around the world.\r\nIn 2006 the United Nations human rights protection \r\nsystem underwent major institutional reform, and \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights was replaced by \r\nthe Human Rights Council. We should recall that \r\none of the fundamental reasons for the change was \r\nthe need to address the unproductive politicization \r\nthat overshadowed the Commission. Sadly, many \r\ndelegations in the Assembly today have expressed the \r\nsame concerns, suggesting that the Council is heading \r\nin the same direction as the former Commission. That \r\nis a worrying development and could rob the Council \r\nof its effectiveness and legitimacy. It is a situation that \r\nSri Lanka is particularly concerned about. The way \r\nin which the Council has also begun to target specific \r\ncountries in a selective manner does not bode well for \r\nits future. A handful of countries have been selected \r\nfor adverse attention by the Council, while others in \r\nsimilar circumstances are ignored.\r\nAs the President indicated, Sri Lanka was the \r\nsubject of Council resolution 25/1, entitled “Promoting \r\nreconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri \r\nLanka”. It is unfortunate that Sri Lanka became the \r\nsubject of a resolution despite widespread recognition \r\nthat we had done more to address the issues arising \r\nfrom the conflict and to promote reconciliation and \r\nreconstruction than almost any other country emerging \r\nfrom similar circumstances in the very short period \r\nof five years. Moreover, the resolution infringes on \r\na fundamental principle of international law, which \r\nrequires that national mechanisms need to be exhausted \r\nbefore resorting to international ones. The resolution \r\nand its mandate also challenge the sovereignty and \r\nindependence of a State Member of the United Nations \r\nby calling for a comprehensive investigation of Sri \r\nLanka’s alleged human rights violations at a time \r\nwhen the country has launched its own inquiries with, \r\ninter alia, the assistance of eminent international \r\npersonalities. It also intrinsically contradicts itself \r\nby requesting both the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) \r\nand the Government of Sri Lanka to conduct parallel \r\ninvestigations. What it may have achieved is a further \r\nhardening of positions on the part of the supporters of \r\nthe defeated terrorist group, which may now seek to \r\nachieve through international intervention what it could \r\nnot realize through terrorism — not a helpful precedent \r\nfor other countries fighting terrorism.\r\nSoon after ending the conflict, the Government of \r\nSri Lanka launched its domestic reconciliation process \r\nby appointing the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation \r\nCommission. After analysing over 1,000 oral and 5,000 \r\nwritten submissions, the Commission presented a \r\n388-page final report in 2011, with 144 comprehensive \r\nrecommendations and observations. Soon after receiving \r\nthe report, the Government developed a national plan \r\nof action to implement those recommendations and \r\nappointed the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee \r\noverseen by the Secretary to the President in order \r\nto facilitate implementation. In August 2013, the \r\nGovernment appointed a three-member presidential \r\ncommission of inquiry to investigate the matter of \r\nmissing persons. The commission has so far received \r\n19,761 complaints for investigation. An international \r\nadvisory panel has been appointed to assist the \r\ncommission. Many of the recommendations have been \r\nimplemented, while others are in the process of being \r\nimplemented. It is important to recognize that 27 years \r\nof terrorist-inspired pain and agony cannot be wished \r\naway in five short years. What really matters is that \r\ntoday we are living in peace, with a booming economy \r\nthat is benefiting all our people.\r\nBy calling for an investigation of Sri Lanka, the \r\nHuman Rights Council has not given adequate credit to \r\nour national reconciliation process. It has also ignored \r\nthe basic principle of working in the first instance with \r\nthe country concerned. For those reasons, inter alia, the \r\nGovernment of Sri Lanka has rejected Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 25/1. Sri Lanka is firmly committed \r\nto doing the right thing by its people. I regret the news \r\nrelease issued by OHCHR two weeks ago, which casts \r\naspersions on the intentions of the Government of Sri \r\nLanka. I would like to emphasize that the Government’s \r\nrejection of the Council’s investigation does not amount \r\nto concealing information. It underscores the fact that, \r\nas a proud and independent country and a people with a \r\nstrong legal tradition, we are capable of conducting the \r\nnecessary investigations.\r\n10/14 14-63478\r\nA/69/PV.54 17/11/2014\r\nI recall the President of the General Assembly’s \r\nappeal last Friday to members of the Assembly, which \r\nemphasized the need to protect the credibility of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Unfortunately, if the Council \r\ncontinues to selectively target individual countries, it \r\nwill lose its effectiveness and credibility. Such actions \r\nnot only undermine the principles of impartiality and \r\nobjectivity enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, but also negatively affect the cooperation that \r\na given country seeks from the Council. Against that \r\nbackground, an important question arises: will the \r\nCouncil ever be able to move away from its politicized \r\nagenda, which is laced with double standards? To be \r\neffective, it must do so.\r\nWe recognize the important contribution that \r\nmechanisms such as the universal periodic review \r\n(UPR) can make to improving human rights situations \r\naround the world. As we have consistently maintained, \r\nSri Lanka considers the UPR to be the most appropriate \r\nforum in which human-rights-related matters pertaining \r\nto a country should be discussed, along with voluntary \r\nengagements under the human rights treaties and \r\ninteractions with special procedures mechanisms. Sri \r\nLanka has appeared before the UPR on two occasions \r\nand is happy to work with it.\r\nSri Lanka also notes with concern the financial \r\nconstraints facing OHCHR and its dependence on \r\nvoluntary contributions. We recommend that the \r\nOHCHR be financed from the regular budget of \r\nthe United Nations in order to reduce its unhealthy \r\ndependence on voluntary contributions. That would \r\nstrengthen the financial independence of the Office, \r\nthereby enhancing transparency and balance and making \r\na positive contribution towards the depoliticization of \r\nits work.\r\nI therefore urge the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to give serious consideration to the views \r\nexpressed by Member States in this debate, as well as \r\nin the Human Rights Council, and to make every effort \r\nto return the focus of the Council to its fundamentals. \r\nThe Council was intended to make the world a better \r\nplace by helping countries that needed assistance, and \r\nnot to engage in selective politics. Such an approach \r\nwould win the Human Rights Council the support of all \r\nparties to continue its important work and contribute \r\ntowards the protection and promotion of human rights.\r\nMr. Ruiz (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express our gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Baudelaire Ndong Ella, President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, for his briefing on the work of \r\nthe Council in 2014.\r\nI would like first of all to emphasize the importance \r\nthat Colombia attaches to the Human Rights Council, \r\nwhich has proved to be an important forum for the \r\ndiscussion, promotion and monitoring of human rights \r\nsituations around the world. The Council’s institutional \r\naction mechanisms, including the special procedures \r\nand especially the universal periodic review, have also \r\nbeen important for their catalysing effect and impact \r\non the ground.\r\nFor all those reasons, Colombia reiterates its firm \r\nsupport for the work of the Council and urges all States \r\nto participate in and collaborate with it. We particularly \r\nurge members to support the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights so that \r\nit can continue to provide the necessary support to the \r\nCouncil and its mechanisms. It is important to keep in \r\nmind that countries are generating more work and more \r\nprocedures for the Council, in large part owing to its \r\nsuccess, but without having strengthened the capacities \r\nof the Office in a timely manner so as to enable it to \r\ntake on the burden of new challenges.\r\nThere has recently been some criticism with respect \r\nto the partiality and growing politicization within the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Colombia does not share that \r\ninterpretation. On the contrary, the Council has found \r\nareas of agreement that have enabled it to work in a \r\ncollective manner despite clear differences on specific \r\nissues.\r\nColombia believes that our shared commitment \r\nto the universalization of human rights, the fight to \r\ncombat all forms of discrimination and the struggle \r\nagainst violence are principles on which all countries \r\nagree. They define the common ground for discussion, \r\ncooperation and the exchange of experiences among \r\nour States and have paved the way for actions that have \r\nhad a positive impact on the ability of all the world’s \r\npeople to enjoy their rights and liberties.\r\nFrom the point of view of my country, that capability \r\nto build common ground and move forward was proved \r\nduring the three sessions of the Council in the course \r\nof 2014. The Council managed to adopt important \r\nresolutions that undoubtedly responded to the calls \r\nmade by the international community and civil society \r\ndespite the differences expressed during the adoption \r\nprocess and negotiations.\r\n14-63478 11/14\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.54\r\nFor that reason, Colombia supports the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council for 2014 (A/69/53). We recognize \r\nthe importance of having a robust, independent and \r\nopen forum that is sensitive to the concerns and \r\npriorities that countries have when it comes to human \r\nrights. Similarly, we acknowledge the importance of \r\ndialogue among partners to find the appropriate ways \r\nto implement resolutions adopted by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, as was mentioned in the joint letter on the \r\nreport of the Council of 2013, dated 11 September 2014, \r\non the understanding of the institutional relationship \r\nbetween the Human Rights Council and the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nFinally, allow me to reaffirm our strong support for \r\nand cooperation with the work of the Council and its \r\nmechanisms.\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwishes to thank His Excellency Mr. Baudelaire Ndong \r\nElla, Permanent Representative of Gabon to the \r\nUnited Nations Office at Geneva, for his excellent \r\nwork as the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nand for presenting the Council’s report to the General \r\nAssembly (A/69/53) (see A/69/PV.52). I would also \r\nlike to congratulate the new High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, His Excellency Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al \r\nHussein, on his assumption of office, and to reiterate \r\nthe Maldives commitment to work with his Office to \r\nstrengthen the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights across the globe. The Maldives would also like \r\nonce again to express its appreciation to the former \r\nHigh Commissioner, Ms. Navi Pillay, for the important \r\nmilestones achieved in human rights during her \r\ntenure, as well as the close relations she kept with the \r\nGovernment of Maldives.\r\nThis year has seen an exponential increase in the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council, as illustrated by the \r\nnumber of panels operating and the resolutions adopted \r\nat the recent sessions. The special sessions dedicated \r\nto human rights situations in the Central African \r\nRepublic, the occupied Palestinian territories and Iraq \r\nare a clear indication of the growing importance of the \r\nCouncil and its mechanisms.\r\nWe are grateful to all members of the Council \r\nfor their commitment to steering through the human \r\nrights challenges of the year. As a member of the \r\nCouncil, the Maldives is proud of what the Council \r\nhas achieved together, in a year marred by violence, \r\nacts of aggression, natural disasters and intensifying \r\nclimate change. While that is not an uplifting picture of \r\nthe state of the world today, we are given hope by the \r\nreports of progress made by the Human Rights Council \r\nand presented to the General Assembly.\r\nHuman rights can be regarded as the most \r\nimportant single issue for international cohesion and \r\ncooperation today. Human rights are a matter of the \r\nhighest priority when responding to conflict situations \r\nsuch as the escalating violence in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories. However, human rights also \r\ncut across all other items on the global agenda. There \r\nis a need to integrate a human-rights-based approach \r\nto development as the Assembly begins its work to \r\nprepare the post-2015 development agenda. There is \r\nalso a need to address the human rights dimensions \r\nof climate change when concluding an international \r\nclimate agreement in Paris 2015. Low-lying nations like \r\nthe Maldives and many small island developing States \r\n(SIDS) face the daily reality of the impact of climate \r\nchange and understand at first hand the fundamental \r\nneed to address it.\r\nThe Maldives is currently undergoing rapid \r\ntransformation; we are a young democracy and a recent \r\ngraduate from the category of least developed countries \r\n(LDCs), growing steadily in terms of both social and \r\neconomic progress. Yet, as a small island developing \r\nState, our path to development faces grave uncertainties \r\nas a result of worsening climate-change scenarios. The \r\ncore principles of human rights, human dignity and \r\nthe rule of law guide us through these times. Those \r\nprinciples are embedded in the new Constitution of \r\n2008. The constitutional protections for human rights \r\nhave ensured that this new stage of development serves \r\nall people and leaves no one behind. The Government \r\nhas given life to those principles with positive law and \r\npolicies. The poor and the vulnerable have the right to \r\nsocial security and income support under the social \r\nprotection act; the elderly are entitled to pensions; the \r\ndisabled receive Government support pursuant to the \r\ndisabilities act; and all Maldivians enjoy universal \r\nhealth care. Most notably, the Maldives has made great \r\nstrides in advancing the rights of women, as seen by \r\nthe recent enactment of the sexual offences and sexual \r\nharassment act, which is aimed at addressing violence \r\nand discrimination against women.\r\nAs seen in the past few years, the Maldives, although \r\na small country, has raised its voice in promoting \r\nhuman rights at the international level. The Maldives is \r\ncurrently serving a second term on the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The Maldives has remained committed in its \r\n12/14 14-63478\r\nA/69/PV.54 17/11/2014\r\nparticipation and contributions to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, while highlighting the need to give voice \r\nto smaller States in larger forums. In particular, the \r\nMaldives has brought the human rights agenda of small \r\nisland developing States to the fore at the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, as well as at the General Assembly.\r\nThe concept of universal human rights, as one of \r\nthe founding principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, should not be in conflict with national \r\nsovereignty. States must be open to willingly engage \r\nin international human rights mechanisms, such as \r\nthe universal periodic review process, including those \r\ncountries in difficult human rights situations. We value \r\nthe technical and other advisory assistance provided \r\nby the United Nations to assist States to implement \r\nthe UPR recommendations. We are encouraged by \r\nthe ongoing efforts of the Human Rights Council, the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights (OHCHR) and the special mandate- \r\nholders to provide that assistance, and we urge donors \r\nto ensure that those vital institutions have the resources \r\nneeded to fulfil their mandates. Despite the limited \r\nand depleted resources available to the Office of the \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office \r\nhas continued its engagement with Member States to \r\nensure that human rights situations are addressed. The \r\nMaldives has always advocated for the importance of \r\ntechnical assistance to improve human rights. That \r\nis especially useful for LDCs and SIDS, which face \r\nmajor challenges in terms of resources and expertise in \r\naddressing those issues.\r\nWhile the legal framework of human rights \r\nprotections is becoming more complex and robust, \r\nthe implementation and enforcement of human rights \r\non the ground remains a critical issue. The Maldives \r\nrecognizes that success in realizing human rights cannot \r\nbe achieved by laws and instruments alone. We must \r\nfoster a culture of civic responsibility and respect for \r\nhuman rights to complement the formal and statutory \r\nmeasures already in place. To be meaningful, the value \r\nof human rights must be embedded in institutions \r\nand be inherent in the way we treat one another. The \r\nexperience of the Maldives suggests that the enjoyment \r\nof human rights and freedoms can be attained only by \r\ncultivating values and building resilience in society. \r\nWe must therefore combine human rights policy-\r\nmaking with programmes and trainings to mainstream \r\na human-rights-based approach in our institutions and \r\neducation to instil a sense of responsibility and respect \r\nfor human rights in society. Our aim should not be to \r\nmeet the bare minimum standards of human rights \r\nprescribed by law or dictated by politics, but to strive \r\nboldly towards the higher, moral responsibility to fulfil \r\nhuman rights for all. We urge all nations to join us in \r\nthat pursuit: aim high and go beyond.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 63.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in the exercise \r\nof the right of reply, may I remind delegations that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and \r\n5 minutes for the second intervention and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Israeli (Israel): Earlier today (see A/69/PV.52) \r\nwe heard the Syrian delegation launch baseless \r\naccusations against Israel. The Syrian Government \r\nseems to think that it can distract attention from its \r\nbrutal and horrific crimes committed against its own \r\npeople. Others in the Arab world also seek to distract \r\nfrom the fundamental issues in the region by making \r\nan array of false accusations about Israel. The problem \r\nwith that tactic is that it does not bring us any closer to \r\nresolving the core challenges facing our region; it only \r\ndrags us further and further away from peace.\r\nIsrael is not what is wrong in the Middle East. It \r\nhas always been and will always be what is right in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nMs. Alsaleh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I take the f loor to exercise my right of reply.\r\nIt is ironic to hear the representative of Israel give \r\nus lessons on human rights in my country and address \r\nthe issue of peace in our region, when just a few weeks \r\nago they carried out their savage act of aggression \r\nagainst Gaza, which in a few days claimed thousands \r\nof lives among women and children. The blood of the \r\nvictims has not even dried yet.\r\nEveryone is aware of the racism and barbarity \r\nshown by the Israeli entity and settlers against the Arab \r\ninhabitants. We cannot forget the barbaric behaviour by \r\na group of Israeli security forces against a Palestinian \r\nwoman on the esplanade of the holy mosques. They \r\nbeat her, pulled off her veil and dragged her across the \r\nsite. That horrible scene clearly demonstrates Israel’s \r\nhatred and resentment of Arabs. Of course, the Western \r\nmedia did not cover the news of the lynching of a \r\nPalestinian cab driver by settlers. He had come from \r\nDeir Yassin, the village invaded by the Zionist militias \r\n14-63478 13/14\r\n17/11/2014 A/69/PV.54\r\nof the Haganah gangs on 9 April 1948, during which \r\nthey killed 257 inhabitants of the village.\r\nThe criticism and condemnation levelled today \r\nagainst Israel within the context of the agenda item \r\nunder consideration should be enough to remind the \r\nrepresentative of the occupying Power that there is an \r\ninternational will that stresses the need to implement \r\nthe United Nations resolutions on putting an end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation and the return of the occupied land \r\nto its rightful owners.\r\nThose who claim that they are wedded to global \r\nhuman rights must act in an exemplary way. We have \r\nrecently shed light on the alliance between Qatar and \r\nIsrael, which has supported and financed the takfirist \r\nterrorist groups since the beginning of the crisis in \r\nSyria. There is clear cooperation between Israel, \r\nQatar and the terrorist Al-Nusra Front in the area of \r\nseparation in the occupied Syrian Golan. Those terrorist \r\ngroups have captured members of the United Nations \r\nDisengagement Observer Force, and they subsequently \r\nreleased them inside Syria following the payment of \r\na ransom by Qatar to the terrorist groups. That is a \r\nridiculous masquerade that one can easily see through. \r\nQatar has been financing a terrorist group — the \r\nAl-Nusra Front — so that it can continue to sow the \r\nseeds of terrorism and chaos throughout the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan, threaten members of the international \r\npeacekeeping mission and help Israel to continue its \r\noccupation of the Syrian Golan.\r\nWe want to say: enough with the hypocrisy and \r\nlies. Stop using the suffering of the Syrian people, an \r\nissue that is completely fabricated in all international \r\nforums. Stop supporting armed terrorist groups, for \r\nthen the Syrian people will be able to live in peace and \r\nharmony.\r\nMr. Laram (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I take the f loor \r\nin exercise of the right of reply. I would like to address \r\nthe cheap claims made by the representative who took \r\nthe f loor just before me. Those accusations voiced by \r\nthe representative of Syria are no different from what \r\nwe usually hear from that quarter. They represent an \r\nattempt to qualify as terrorist any request aimed at \r\nobtaining legitimate rights for the Syrian people. They \r\nare aimed at preventing us from condemning the crimes \r\nagainst civilians and the grave violations of human \r\nrights and international law committed by the regime \r\nand by the groups affiliated with it.\r\nIn Qatar we are especially aware of the threat of \r\nterrorism, terrorist organizations and foreign terrorist \r\nfighters, both in our region and throughout the world. \r\nOf course, our interests can in no way be aligned with \r\nthose of any terrorist group, regardless of what it is or \r\nwhere it is. That is why we stand up against the position \r\nof the bloodthirsty Syrian regime against its people. We \r\nare going to continue to cooperate with the international \r\ncommunity to combat terrorism and to eradicate it at its \r\nvery source in the region. We were part of the group \r\nof countries that supported Security Council resolution \r\n2178 (2014), on combating terrorism, and we have \r\nundertaken a great many measures to implement that \r\nresolution.\r\nThe Syrians are a brotherly people known for their \r\nreligious and cultural pluralism and their rejection \r\nof extremism. However, those people attempted, \r\nunfortunately for them, to demand their legitimate basic \r\nrights and were immediately accused of being terrorists \r\nand of acting in an extremist manner by the authorities \r\nand were treated as such. Children in schools, the sick in \r\nhospitals and people in their homes — all were heavily \r\nbombarded by the Government that was supposed \r\nto protect them. The Government is trampling the \r\npeoples’s very honour underfoot.\r\nThe Syrian regime is not fighting against terrorism. \r\nIndeed, the regime is one of the primary causes of the \r\nviolence and terrorism in Syria. That is something we \r\nhave repeatedly warned about. The crimes committed \r\nby the regime against civilians are no different from \r\nthe crimes carried out by terrorist groups in Syria. \r\nThe victims are the same — civilians and civilian \r\ninstitutions, who are being subjected to attempts, for \r\npolitical purposes, to terrorize them and to force them \r\nto f lee.\r\nWe do not wish to be drawn into a lengthy debate \r\ntriggered by the representative of a regime that no \r\nlonger enjoys any legitimacy. For that reason, I will end \r\nmy statement here.\r\nMs. Alsaleh (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I would like to start by saying that the Syrian \r\npeople do not accept and will never accept that a \r\nrepresentative from a country like Qatar might take \r\nthe f loor and speak on its behalf, when Qatar has been \r\nknown to have backed terrorism from the very beginning \r\nof the crisis in Syria. If Qatar were truly aware of the \r\nthreat of terrorism, we would not be witnesses to the \r\nhundreds of international reports that have documented \r\n14/14 14-63478\r\nA/69/PV.54 17/11/2014\r\nQatar’s support for armed terrorist groups, not only in \r\nSyria but in the region as a whole. I refer to the June \r\n2014 CNN report that showed the role played by the \r\nQatari regime in that respect by stating, first of all, \r\nthat Qatar is a key ally of the United States of America. \r\nThe report also addressed the support lent to Wahhabi \r\ngroups, including those affiliated with Al-Qaida, such \r\nas Daesh and the Al-Nusra Front. I can say that without \r\neven having to refer to the statements made by a great \r\nmany European politicians on the support lent to those \r\ngroups by Qatar and individuals with oil interests in \r\nthe region.\r\nConsequently, if one seeks to give us lessons on \r\nhuman rights, one should act in an exemplary fashion \r\noneself. I would like to remind the representative of \r\nQatar of the brazen, systematic violations of human \r\nrights against non-Qataris living in his country, in \r\nparticular against migrant labourers, men and women. \r\nThe existence of such violations is not merely an \r\nallegation by the Syrian Government; those practices \r\nare also clearly set forth in reports of the International \r\nLabour Organization and Amnesty International. \r\nThose two organizations have documented cases of \r\nslavery involving immigrant workers residing in Qatar, \r\nas well as cases of abuse, violence, rape, bodily injury \r\nand mental and sexual injury. Those are the conclusions \r\nof two international organizations, and what happens in \r\nQatar takes place within a legal regime that encourages \r\nsuch crimes and punishes the victim rather than the \r\nperpetrator.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded the present stage \r\nof its consideration of agenda item 63.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.15 p.m.\r\n"
