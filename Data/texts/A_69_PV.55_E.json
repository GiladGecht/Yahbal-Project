"*1463492*\r\n14-63492 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 66\r\nElimination of racism, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and related intolerance\r\n(b) Comprehensive implementation of and \r\nfollow-up to the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action\r\nDraft resolution (A/69/L.3)\r\nAgenda item 132 (continued)\r\nProgramme budget for the biennium 2014-2015\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/69/563)\r\nThe President: It is with a sense of pride and \r\nsatisfaction that I preside over the General Assembly \r\nat this historic moment when the United Nations is \r\nabout to embark on the observation of the International \r\nDecade for People of African Descent.\r\nWhen one thinks of the courage and fortitude \r\nof the people of African descent emerging from the \r\ndevastating reality that was slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade, one cannot but be humbled to know how \r\nfar they have come. However, while recognizing the \r\nprogress made, we need to go much further. Racism \r\nand cultural, structural and institutional discrimination \r\nagainst people of African descent continue to manifest \r\nthemselves in situations that limit access to quality \r\neducation, employment, housing and health care. \r\nWorldwide, people of African descent are frequently \r\namong the most marginalized members of society. \r\nThey also inhabit the poorest districts with the most \r\nprecarious and neglected infrastructure. They are \r\nvulnerable to crime and violence. In attempts to seek \r\nlegal redress, they too often face discrimination in \r\naccess to justice.\r\nIn 2001 we adopted the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action at the World Conference against \r\nRacism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \r\nIntolerance. The Programme of Action confirmed what \r\nwe all know to be true — that people of African descent \r\nstill suffer as victims from the consequences of slavery, \r\nthe slave trade and colonialism. With the adoption of the \r\ntheme of the International Decade — “People of African \r\ndescent: recognition, justice and development” — the \r\ninternational community has provided an opportunity \r\nto have a global conversation about the burdens and the \r\naccomplishments of people of African descent.\r\nEvidence of the contributions of people of African \r\ndescent to the development of our societies is abundant \r\nand irrefutable. The International Decade is designed \r\nto celebrate those contributions. In so doing, the \r\nInternational Decade can help break down the walls \r\nof stereotype and stigma that often surround people \r\nof African descent. It is equally important for the \r\nInternational Decade to raise awareness and contribute \r\nto the efforts of Member States and the international \r\ncommunity to ensure the promotion, respect, protection \r\nand fulfilment of human rights of peoples of African \r\ndissent and their full and equal participation in all \r\naspects of society.\r\nToday we have a unique opportunity to make this \r\nInternational Decade one of the actions of promise. \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.55\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n55th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 18 November 2014, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

African descendants \r\naround the world are watching and counting on us to \r\ndo so.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.3, entitled “Programme of activities \r\nfor the implementation of the International Decade for \r\nPeople of African Descent”.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly decides to adopt \r\ndraft resolution A/69/L.3?\r\nDraft resolution A/69/L.3 was adopted (resolution \r\n69/16).\r\nThe President: Before giving the f loor to speakers \r\nin explanation of position, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations are limited to 10 minutes and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Bova (Italy): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the European Union (EU).\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the South \r\nAfrican facilitator, Ambassador Mamabolo, for his \r\nstewardship of this process. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the African Group, the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, Brazil and other delegations that have \r\nbeen engaged interlocutors during the consultation \r\nprocess leading to today’s unanimous adoption of the \r\nprogramme activities for the International Decade for \r\nPeople of African Descent (resolution 69/16, annex).\r\nThe EU has been, is and will remain a firm believer \r\nin the international fight against all forms of racism, \r\nxenophobia and intolerance, and will always advocate \r\nfor the promotion and protection of the human rights of \r\nall, including those of people of African descent.\r\nAs we have repeated throughout this process, it \r\nis only through the ownership and engagement of all \r\nStates that the Decade can successfully achieve its \r\nobjectives. In this light, we expect the Decade to be \r\nimplemented in an effective and collaborative manner at \r\nthe local, national and international levels. To that end, \r\nnational action and political will are paramount. The \r\nEuropean Union and its member States look forward to \r\ncontinue playing an active role in the implementation \r\nof the Decade.\r\nOne of the main concerns for my delegation, prior \r\nto the adoption of resolution 69/16 today, was the \r\nbudgetary implications of the programme activities. It \r\nis therefore important that the programme just adopted \r\nbe implemented in an efficient and effective manner, \r\nunder the leadership of the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating the EU’s commitment \r\nto ensuring a successful Decade, with a focus on the \r\nadded value and concrete improvements in the fight \r\nagainst racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance everywhere in the world.\r\nMr. Israeli (Israel): Israel recognizes that \r\nresolution 69/16 contains extremely important \r\nelements, and Israel supports its goal. However, \r\nIsrael must disassociate itself from the reference in \r\nseveral preambular paragraphs in the resolution to the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted \r\nby the World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in \r\n2001 and related processes.\r\nThirteen years ago, the majority of countries \r\nremained silent while the Durban Conference became \r\na vehicle for incitement, racism, anti-Semitism, \r\nintolerance and prejudice against the State of Israel. The \r\nJewish people have fought against racism throughout \r\nour history, and Israel remains committed to this goal.\r\nMr. Dempsey (Canada): While Canada supports \r\nthe essence and objectives of resolution 69/16, it \r\nopposes the references to the Durban Declaration and \r\nProgramme of Action adopted by the World Conference \r\nagainst Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related \r\nIntolerance in 2001 and related processes contained in \r\nthe perambular sections of the resolution. Instead of \r\nfostering concerted global action against racism, the \r\n2001 Conference degenerated into a politicized forum \r\nthat served to promote intolerance and anti-Semitism \r\nrather than combat it. Canada firmly believes that \r\nthe Durban process remains highly politicized to this \r\nday and that it has been unable to distance itself from \r\nits controversial past, including its open and divisive \r\nexpressions of intolerance and anti-Semitism.\r\nWhile Canada disapproves of the reference to that \r\nprocess in this resolution, Canada will nevertheless \r\ncontinue to work in practical ways with the United \r\nNations and its Member States towards addressing \r\nracism, promoting tolerance and non-discrimination \r\nand recognizing and promoting the rights of people of \r\nAfrican descent.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of position.\r\n14-63492 3/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Brazil takes this \r\nopportunity to welcome the adoption of resolution 69/16, \r\non the programme of activities for the implementation \r\nof the International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent. Allow me to take this opportunity to thank \r\nyou, Mr. President, for organizing a high-level event \r\nto officially launch, on 10 December – Human Rights \r\nDay – the International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent, as mandated by resolution 68/237.\r\nWe agree with you, Mr. President, that 13 years \r\nafter the 2001 World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\ndiscrimination faced by people of African descent is \r\nstill a challenge due to violence and lack of education \r\nand employment. To that we can add social and \r\neconomic inequality and a lack of national legislation \r\non combating racial discrimination.\r\nBrazil has arduously worked, both in Geneva \r\nand in New York, towards a strong agreement on the \r\nprogramme of activities that could serve as a road map \r\nfor promoting racial equality worldwide. Allow me \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate Ambassador \r\nKingsley Mamabolo for successfully concluding the \r\nconsultation process on the programme of activities, as \r\nwell as to thank the regional groups, the African group, \r\nthe Caribbean Community and the European Union for \r\ncontributing to this successful outcome.\r\nBrazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants \r\noutside of Africa. In 2013, that segment of the Brazilian \r\npopulation accounted for over 100 million, and that \r\nnumber is expected to rise to over 115 million by 2042. \r\nHowever, more than three centuries of slavery have \r\ntaken their toll. Although people of African descent are \r\na majority in Brazil, they still live on the outskirts of \r\nurban centres, earn lower wages and have less access \r\nto education. In addition, according to statistics, their \r\nsons and daughters are more vulnerable to violence.\r\nPresident Dilma Rousseff has made it clear that \r\nracism is not only a heinous crime but also an outrage \r\nthat we must spare no effort to punish and eradicate. \r\nPublic policies and the engagement of the State \r\nare essential. Brazil has implemented affirmative \r\nprogrammes and national policies aimed at ending \r\nextreme poverty, including conditional cash transfers, \r\nsocial safety nets, minimum wage legislation and \r\nGovernment procurement of food and services within \r\nlocal communities. Those have contributed significantly \r\nto poverty eradication in general and the reduction of \r\nthe inequalities among different racial and vulnerable \r\ngroups in particular.\r\nOver the past 10 years, Brazil has lifted over \r\n36 million people out of extreme poverty. Seventy-\r\nfive per cent of this new emerging middle class are of \r\nAfrican descent. Whereas in 2002 only 38 per cent of \r\nthe middle class was comprised of African-Brazilians, \r\nin 2012 they made up 51 per cent of the Brazilian \r\npopulation.\r\nBrazil attaches immense importance to the \r\nInternational Decade for People of African Descent and \r\nto the programme of activities, which, we expect, will \r\ncontribute to the full implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action and raise \r\nawareness on combating prejudice, intolerance and \r\nracism.\r\nThe theme for the International Decade for People \r\nof African Descent is “People of African descent: \r\nrecognition, justice and development”. We expect \r\nthat by launching the Decade and implementing its \r\nprogramme of activities, Member States, along with \r\ncivil society, the United Nations and all other relevant \r\nstakeholders, will show their resolve to promote respect \r\nfor and the protection and fulfilment of all human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms to the benefit of people of \r\nAfrican descent. Brazil also expects that we will be \r\nable to raise awareness of the rich cultural legacy of \r\npeople of African descent and their knowledge, diverse \r\nheritage and culture all over the world.\r\nTen years from now, we hope our work will have \r\nbrought justice to people of African descent, honoured \r\ntheir culture and history and rectified the social and \r\neconomic inequality they have been subjected to.\r\nWe believe diversity is an asset. By promoting \r\nrespect for the human rights of all people of African \r\ndescent, we are unmistakably strengthening our \r\ncommon bonds as human beings.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of sub-item (b) \r\nof agenda item 66.\r\nAgenda item 113\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments\r\n(a) Appointment of members of the Advisory \r\nCommittee on Administrative and \r\nBudgetary Questions\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/69/564)\r\nThe President: In paragraph 4 of its report, \r\nthe Fifth Committee recommends that the General \r\n4/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nAssembly appoint the following persons as members \r\nof the Advisory Committee on Administrative and \r\nBudgetary Questions for a three-year term of office \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2015: Mr. Pavel Chernikov \r\n(Russian Federation), Mr. Ali A.

The \r\nFifth Committee adopted the draft resolution, entitled \r\n“Programme Planning”, without a vote. May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 69/17).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of agenda item \r\n113.\r\nAgenda items 117 and 118\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nThe President: For more than two decades, \r\nthis body has considered the agenda item entitled \r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly” \r\nas an integral part of its efforts to strengthen the \r\nOrganization as a whole. Although the world has \r\ndrastically changed from what it was almost 70 years \r\nago, the role of the General Assembly, as the chief \r\ndeliberative body and representative organ of the United \r\nNations, has remained central. We are now at a defining \r\nmoment as we deliberate this item. We are reaching the \r\ntarget date for achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which will be succeeded by the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, currently being formulated, as key \r\ncomponents of the post-2015 development agenda. As \r\nwe pursue this agenda, it is essential that we continue \r\ngiving urgent attention to enhancing the role, authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the General Assembly. \r\nThat is one of the priorities I have laid out during this \r\nsession.\r\nResolution 68/307, of 10 September 2014, established \r\nan ad hoc working group on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly. The resolution called \r\nfor the Working Group to be open to all Member States \r\nand\r\n“To identify further ways to enhance the \r\nrole, authority, effectiveness and efficiency of the \r\nAssembly, inter alia, by building on the progress \r\nachieved in past sessions as well as on previous \r\nresolutions, including evaluating the status of their \r\nimplementation” (resolution 68/307, para. 3 (a)).\r\nI thank Ambassador František Ružička, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovakia, and Ambassador Norachit \r\nSinhaseni, Permanent Representative of Thailand, \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly, for \r\ntheir leadership and the work done during the previous \r\nsession.\r\nThrough the four clusters, the Working Group has \r\nmade efforts to explore how best to enhance the voice \r\nand impact of the Assembly, in line with its mandate \r\nand the realities of today’s world. Let me recall some \r\nhighlights of that work.\r\nThe first cluster relates to the role and authority of \r\nthe General Assembly. It is essential that the resolutions \r\nadopted by this body be implemented and that \r\ncooperation between the Assembly and the principle \r\norgans of the United Nations be continuously pursued. \r\nI intend to strengthen that cooperation, coordination \r\nand exchange of information with the other principle \r\norgans, and also with the Secretariat and, in particular, \r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nI welcome the progress made in improving the \r\nworking methods of the Assembly and its Main \r\nCommittees — the second cluster of our revitalization \r\nagenda. We have to maintain that steadfastness, as the \r\nefficient and coherent work of the Committees has \r\nfar-reaching impact, particularly in the Assembly’s \r\nability to make timely and meaningful decisions. \r\nBy rationalizing our agenda and making it more \r\n14-63492 7/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nfocused we also enhance the quality and impact of the \r\nconsideration of topics, while reflecting the priorities \r\nof Member States.\r\nWe should preserve the integrity and eminence of \r\nthe general debate. An important lesson from the general \r\ndebate heard this year is that we need to rationalize the \r\nnumber of meetings and side events held on the margins \r\nof the general debate so as to enable greater focus \r\non the matters being discussed in the Hall by world \r\nleaders. During this session, I will convene high-level \r\nmeetings and thematic debates on current issues of \r\ncritical importance to the international community. In \r\nmy previous statements at the Assembly, I outlined the \r\nspecific meetings and events. I will continue to consult \r\nwith the General Committee and Member States on the \r\npreliminary programme of those debates, as well as \r\non the possibilities for achieving results-oriented and \r\nproductive outcomes from them.\r\nI wish to note the important and tangible outcome \r\nof the scheduling of early elections for members of the \r\nSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council. \r\nBeginning with the seventieth session, elections to \r\nthese organs will take place six months before the \r\nelected States assume their responsibilities.\r\nI also note that work has been progressing \r\nwith regard to the third cluster, on the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General and of other \r\nexecutive heads. That is consistent with resolution \r\n68/307, which, inter alia, re-emphasizes the need for the \r\nSecretary-General’s selection process to be transparent \r\nand inclusive, in accordance with Article 97 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe fourth, and final, cluster — strengthening the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly — will also play an important \r\nrole in reinvigorating the Assembly. I commend the \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its sixty-eighth session for \r\nfacilitating transition and continuity in the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly. I also recognize the \r\nvital support provided by the Secretariat, in particular \r\nthe Department for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement. In the coming period, I look forward \r\nto briefing Member States on my Office’s activities \r\nagainst the backdrop of an increased workload. I thank \r\nMember States for their continued support to the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly.\r\nI will actively involve Member States in the \r\nwork of the Assembly. During the last few weeks, I \r\nappointed Chairs and facilitators for different items of \r\nour work agenda. In that regard, I thank Ambassador \r\nVladimir Drobnjak, Permanent Representative of \r\nCroatia, and Ambassador Wilfried Emvula, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Namibia, for agreeing to serve as the \r\nnew co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly. \r\nI call on all Member States to support their efforts to \r\nadvance the agenda of the Ad Hoc Working Group.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate that the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the Assembly will remain a priority during \r\nthis session. I look forward to the Assembly’s collective \r\nsupport and contribution.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).\r\nAt the outset, the gratitude of NAM members \r\ngoes out to His Excellency Mr. František Ružička, \r\nPermanent Representative of Slovakia, and to our friend \r\nMr. Norachit Sinhaseni, Permanent Representative of \r\nThailand, for their tireless efforts and excellent work \r\nin co-chairing the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly \r\nduring the sixty-eighth session. I would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Wilfried I. Emvula, Permanent Representative \r\nof Namibia, and Mr. Vladimir Drobnjak, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Croatia, for their appointment as \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group during the \r\nsixty-ninth session and to wish them every success.\r\nI would like to remind the General Assembly that \r\nNAM welcomed the adoption of the resolution 68/307 \r\nin September, by which the Assembly established the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group to discuss issues related to the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly during the this \r\nsession. The Non-Aligned Movement underlines that \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nis a political process, rather than a procedural one, \r\nthat aims mainly at strengthening the role of the \r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the Organization in the broader \r\nUnited Nations system. The process should therefore \r\nbe conducted in an inclusive, transparent and efficient \r\nmanner. Hence, the Movement reiterates the importance \r\nof the revitalization of the General Assembly as an item \r\nthat deserves consideration on an equal footing with \r\nother reform processes and important topics of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe wish to reaffirm the role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly, including on questions \r\n8/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nrelated to international peace and security, and its \r\nintergovernmental, inclusive and democratic character, \r\nwhich have immensely contributed to the promotion of \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the goals of the Organization. Our group \r\nreaffirms as well the intergovernmental nature of the \r\nUnited Nations as such and draws attention to the need \r\nto consult with Members States on the initiatives and \r\nactivities undertaken within the Organization and to \r\nthe right of all Member States to express their positions \r\nbefore the General Assembly at any time they wish to \r\ndo so.\r\nThe General Assembly, as the policymaking \r\norgan of the Organization, holds the authority and \r\nthe essential role of drawing the framework, setting \r\nthe principles and identifying the objectives for the \r\nwider United Nations system and its numerous organs, \r\nagencies and programmes. Furthermore, the Assembly \r\nshould remain the principal organ that reviews the work \r\nof all its subsidiary organs and bodies.\r\nThe General Assembly should also maintain its role \r\nand mandate in setting the priorities of the United Nations \r\nin considering all budgetary and administrative issues \r\nand reforms, including its absolute authority to allocate \r\nand reallocate financial and human resources and in \r\nthe appointment of senior officials of the Secretariat, \r\nin accordance with the Charter and relevant General \r\nAssembly resolutions. In that regard, the prerogatives \r\nof the General Assembly as the chief oversight organ \r\nof the Organization, including on management and \r\nprocurement for peacekeeping operations, must be \r\nrespected.\r\nWhile expressing its readiness to continue to \r\nsupport all ongoing efforts to strengthen the central \r\nrole and authority of the Assembly, NAM wishes to \r\nstate that it will not accept any approach that seeks to \r\nundermine or minimize the achievements of the General \r\nAssembly, diminish its current role and functioning or \r\nraise questions about its relevance and credibility.\r\nThe Movement recalls the decision taken in \r\nparagraph 4 of resolution 68/307 requesting the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group to continue the process of the \r\ncomprehensive review of the inventory on the status of \r\nimplementation of the resolutions on the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly and to issue an updated version. \r\nNAM also recalls that in paragraph 5 of the same \r\nresolution the Secretary-General is requested to submit \r\nan update on the related provisions that have not been \r\nimplemented, with an indication as to the constraints \r\nand reasons behind the lack of implementation.\r\nFurthermore, the group believes firmly, as set out in \r\nparagraph 7 of the resolution, that the implementation of \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions, including those related \r\nto the revitalization of its work, enhances the role, \r\nauthority, effectiveness and efficiency of the Assembly, \r\nand underlines the important role and responsibility of \r\nMember States in their full implementation.\r\nObviously, political will is indeed key to ensuring \r\nthe effective implementation of the resolutions adopted \r\nby the General Assembly. In that regard, NAM welcomes \r\nthe decision to issue the updated inventory chart of the \r\nAssembly’s resolutions on revitalization,  to be annexed \r\nto the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group submitted \r\nto the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. The annex \r\nwill provide Member States with an opportunity to \r\nassess the progress achieved in the implementation of \r\nthe previous resolutions since the sixty-third session.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to say \r\nthat NAM emphasizes the need to fully respect the \r\nfunctions and powers of each principal organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular the General Assembly, \r\nand to maintain the balance among the organs within \r\ntheir respective Charter-based functions and powers. \r\nIn that regard, the Security Council must fully observe \r\nall Charter provisions, as well as all General Assembly \r\nresolutions that clarify the Council’s relationship with \r\nthe Assembly and other principal organs.\r\nIn that context, NAM again expresses its concern, \r\nraised during previous sessions, with regard to the \r\ncontinuous attempt by the Security Council to encroach \r\nupon the powers and prerogatives of the General \r\nAssembly. In fact, Article 24, paragraph 1, of the \r\nCharter does not provide the Security Council with \r\nthe competence to address issues that fall within the \r\nfunctions and powers of the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. In the same vein, NAM \r\nreiterates its request to the Security Council to submit a \r\nmore explanatory, comprehensive and analytical annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly, assessing the work of \r\nthe Council, including in such cases where the Council \r\nhas failed to act.\r\nFurthermore, in resolutions 58/126, 59/313 and \r\n60/286, annex, paragraph 7, the General Assembly \r\ninvited the Security Council to submit periodically, \r\nin accordance with Articles 15 and 24 of the Charter, \r\nspecial subject-oriented reports to the General \r\n14-63492 9/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nAssembly for its consideration on issues of current \r\ninternational concern. Since the adoption of resolution \r\n58/126, no special subject-oriented reports have been \r\nformally submitted to the General Assembly. The \r\nspecial subjects are to some extent covered only by the \r\nmonthly assessments presented by the Presidents of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMoreover, NAM is convinced that activities of \r\nthe Special Committee on the Charter of the United \r\nNations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the \r\nOrganization will contribute greatly to the whole \r\nprocess of revitalization. NAM supports in particular \r\nthe two proposals that are discussed by the Special \r\nCommittee: first, the creation of an open-ended \r\nworking group to study the proper implementation of \r\nthe Charter with respect to the functional relationship \r\nof its organs, and second, the working paper on the \r\nstrengthening of the role of the Organization and \r\nenhancing its effectiveness.\r\nAmong other prerogatives and mandates of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, there is the issue of the selection \r\nand appointment of Secretaries-General of the United \r\nNations. NAM attaches the utmost importance to that \r\nquestion. NAM reaffirms the need for the selection \r\nof the Secretary-General to be more transparent and \r\ninclusive of all Member States. NAM deplores that up \r\nto now no consultations on the appointment of a new \r\nSecretary-General have ever taken place, as reflected in \r\nthe updated inventory chart annexed to the report of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group. The Movement emphasizes, \r\ntherefore, the necessity that the participation of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in the selection and the appointment \r\nof future Secretaries-General should be more active, \r\neffective and efficient, in conformity with the Charter \r\nand rules of procedures of the General Assembly and \r\nin accordance with the provisions of resolutions 51/241, \r\n60/286, 64/301, 66/294, 67/297 and 68/307.\r\nNAM stresses the importance of the full \r\nimplementation of the aforementioned resolutions in the \r\nimmediate next process of selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General. In the run-up to the selection \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General, \r\nwhich is expected to take place in two years, NAM \r\nencourages the holding of timely hearings or meetings \r\nof the General Assembly for an exchange of views \r\nand dialogue with candidates running for the post of \r\nSecretary-General. NAM also encourages the President \r\nof the General Assembly to play a proactive role in that \r\nprocess.\r\nThe Movement emphasizes the importance of \r\nensuring the effectiveness of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly, including through the \r\nstrengthening of its institutional memory. While noting \r\nwith appreciation the progress already achieved in that \r\nregard, we are of the view that a particular effort should \r\nbe devoted to the implementation of existing resolutions \r\non the matter, as well as to identifying, during the \r\nupcoming discussions of the Working Group, ways and \r\nmeans to pursue that objective progressively and with \r\ndetermination.\r\nIt is clear that while the prerogatives of the President \r\nof the General Assembly have not changed, his role and \r\nhis activities have evolved over the past years, both in \r\nadapting to the growing activities, conferences and \r\ninitiatives of the Assembly and in performing official \r\nprotocol functions in representing the Assembly all \r\nover the world and making the Assembly’s work more \r\nknown and more visible. Thus, the activities of the \r\nOffice of the President have increased drastically over \r\nthe years. \r\nThe agenda of the Assembly, and consequently \r\nthat of its President, includes a tremendous number of \r\nissues. The expansion in the activities of the General \r\nAssembly, including the yearly adoption of nearly 300 \r\nresolutions and decisions, the establishment of working \r\ngroups and the appointment of facilitators who convene \r\nmeetings and consultations throughout the year have \r\nmade the presence of the President and his or her active \r\nparticipation necessary during the entire session. \r\nMoreover, the Assembly’s workload is no longer \r\nlimited to its main session, but rather covers the whole \r\nperiod from the opening of the session in September to \r\nits closing the following September. Those enormous \r\nincreasing activities should of course be matched with \r\nall the necessary resources, both human and financial.\r\nHence, in order to provide further insight on the \r\ndiversity and complexity of the activities and duties of \r\nthe President, NAM recalls the request of Member States \r\naddressed to the President of the General Assembly \r\nat the sixty-eighth session, in cooperation with the \r\nSecretariat, to report to the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe role, mandate and activities of the President.\r\nIn the same spirit, the Movement seeks more \r\nclarification regarding the budgetary basis for the \r\nprovision by the Secretariat of sources of the funding and \r\nstaffing of the Office of the President of the Assembly, \r\nas stipulated in paragraph 35 of resolution 68/307. The \r\n10/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nMovement recalls, in that regard, that resolution 68/307 \r\nrequests the Secretary-General to submit proposals, in \r\nthe context of the proposed programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2016-2017, to review the budget allocation to \r\nthe Office of the President.\r\nIn conclusion, NAM reaffirms that a reinvigorated \r\nGeneral Assembly, in a more responsive environment, \r\nexerting fully its role and authority, would significantly \r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the wider United \r\nNations system and to improving international \r\ngovernance and enhancing multilateralism.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Van Den Akker (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union and \r\nits member States. The candidate countries Turkey, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania, the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, as well as the Republic of Moldova, \r\nArmenia and Georgia, align themselves with this \r\nstatement.\r\nI would like to thank the previous co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, the Permanent Representatives of Slovakia \r\nand Thailand, for the excellent work done. I would also \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nhis appointment of the Permanent Representative of \r\nCroatia and the Permanent Representative of Namibia \r\nto serve as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the General Assembly. We wish \r\nthem success and express our support.\r\nThe European Union and its member States are \r\nstrongly attached to effective multilateralism with the \r\nUnited Nations at its core. The strengthening the United \r\nNations, based on effective and sustainable funding in \r\nline with the real capacity to pay, and increasing the \r\nefficiency of its functioning, on which there is scope \r\nto do more, remain our top priorities. In that context, \r\nwe continue to be committed to revitalization and to \r\nsupporting efforts aimed at strengthening the role and \r\nauthority of the General Assembly, in line with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions.\r\nIndeed, we wish that the General Assembly, \r\nas the only intergovernmental body with universal \r\nmembership and given its broad mandate with far-\r\nreaching responsibilities, would be able to take up the \r\nchallenge of conciliating legitimacy and efficiency in a \r\ncontext of emerging global challenges. At the same time, \r\nwe wish to reiterate that it is imperative that concrete \r\nsteps be taken at all levels to spend more wisely, to \r\ndeliver in new ways and to ensure that the Organization \r\nlives within the agreed budget levels. That applies to \r\nall activities of the United Nations, from peacekeeping \r\nto construction to the regular budget. An unceasing \r\neffort to find new and creative ways to work is essential \r\nto achieve a more effective delivery on mandates and \r\nsustainable use of resources.\r\nWe believe that revitalization can be ensured only \r\nwhen the General Assembly takes relevant action \r\non issues of common concern to the international \r\ncommunity and produces results. By doing so, it lives \r\nup to its role as one of the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. The European Union and its member \r\nStates welcome the adoption of resolution 68/307, with \r\nimportant provisions such as earlier election of the \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council and \r\nthe members of the Economic and Social Council. We \r\nwelcome the reiteration of the interim arrangement \r\non the rotation pattern of the Chairs of the Main \r\nCommittees, adopted in decision 68/505 in connection \r\nwith guidelines for future arrangements contained in \r\nthe annex to resolution 68/307. \r\nAlso, we would like to stress the importance of \r\nthe implementation of all resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly, including on the revitalization of its work, \r\nand to note its impact on the Assembly’s authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency. The revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly is clearly interlinked \r\nwith the overall reform of the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly revitalization process \r\nhas already led to positive developments such as the \r\nthematic debates, which facilitate more in-depth \r\ndiscussions on current issues of critical importance \r\nto the international community. The European Union \r\nand its member States especially value the interactive \r\ncharacter of thematic debates, which allows for closer \r\nengagement by the Assembly with other stakeholders, \r\ninternational and regional organizations and groups \r\noutside the United Nations system. We look forward to \r\nthe continuation of that practice and invite the President \r\nof the General Assembly to consult with Member States \r\non the possibilities, where appropriate, in the spirit of \r\npartnerships, engaging a broad range of stakeholders and \r\nachieving results-oriented outcomes in such debates. \r\nWe also recognize the importance of the interaction \r\n14-63492 11/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nbetween the General Assembly and international and \r\nregional forums and organizations dealing with global \r\nmatters of concern to the international community, as \r\nwell as the benefits to be drawn from such interaction.\r\nWe appreciate the continued practice of convening \r\nperiodic informal briefings by the Secretary-General \r\non his priorities, travels and most recent activities, \r\nincluding his participation in international meetings \r\nand events organized outside the United Nations, and \r\nwe encourage him to continue that practice.\r\nAs to the relationship of the General Assembly \r\nwith other principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nthe European Union and its member States believe \r\nthat improving transparency and cooperation remain \r\nimportant goals. The Assembly should benefit from \r\ninformation about the meetings between the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly, the Security Council and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council, as well as with the \r\nchairs of subsidiary bodies. Periodic briefings by the \r\nAssembly President on his recent activities, including \r\nofficial travels, continue to be an appreciated practice \r\nand are a valuable source of information.\r\nOn the issue of working methods, we wish to \r\nrecall the need to consider and take steps towards the \r\nrationalization of the agenda of the General Assembly \r\nand of the Economic and Social Council with a view \r\nto eliminating duplication and overlap and promoting \r\ncomplementarity in the consideration and negotiation \r\nof similar and related issues. \r\nIn that context, it is important to point out resolution \r\n68/1. We are of the opinion that it would be appropriate \r\nto examine further biennialization and triennialization \r\nof certain items, as well as their clustering or \r\nelimination, including through the introduction of a \r\nsunset clause, with the clear consent of the sponsoring \r\nState or States. In that regard, the leadership of the \r\nChairs and the Bureaus of the Main Committees is of \r\nparticular importance. We look forward to the briefings \r\nto the Ad Hoc Working Group on working methods by \r\nthe Chairs of the Main Committees. Although each of \r\nthe Main Committees has its own authority over the \r\nrules of procedure, we believe that streamlining and \r\nstandardizing some should lead to the more efficient \r\nwork by the Committees. \r\nWe would like to stress as well the importance \r\nof making full use of e-services provided by the \r\nSecretariat. The widespread use by Main Committees \r\nand Member States alike of such e-services, including \r\nthe PaperSmart portal, has had a positive impact on \r\nthe work of the General Assembly during its main \r\nsession, while it has also saved a considerable amount \r\nof resources, energy and paper. We have to continue to \r\nwork in that direction.\r\nWe look forward to the active roles of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the President of the General Assembly, \r\nincluding in his capacity as the Chair of the General \r\nCommittee, and the Chairs of the Main Committees, \r\nin consultation with Member States, in enhancing \r\nthe coordination of the scheduling of high-level \r\nmeetings with the view to optimizing their number and \r\ndistribution throughout the year, while bearing in mind \r\nthe need to preserve the integrity of the general debate. \r\nWe believe that the General Committee could play a \r\nuseful role in the process.\r\nFinally, let me emphasize the important role that \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group plays in the revitalization \r\nof the work of General Assembly. I would like to assure \r\nthe Assembly that the European Union and its member \r\nStates will continue to engage in a constructive manner \r\nin the proceedings of the Ad Hoc Working Group. We \r\nlook forward to receiving a workplan soon.\r\nMr. Tuy (Cambodia): At the outset, before I \r\ndeliver a statement on behalf of the member States of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nallow me to say a few words on the issue of the list of \r\nspeakers. \r\nI would like to draw your kind attention, \r\nMr. President, to the matter of the order of speakers. \r\nASEAN member States have considered paragraph 1 (b) \r\nto the annex of resolution 65/276, on the participation of \r\nthe European Union in the work of the United Nations. \r\nIt states that the observer of the European Union, in \r\norder to present the position of the European Union and \r\nits member States as agreed by them, shall be invited \r\nto participate in the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly in accordance with the order of precedence \r\nas established in the practice for participating \r\nobservers and their level of participation. In keeping \r\nto the letter and spirit of resolution 65/276, the member \r\nStates of ASEAN are therefore of the opinion that the \r\nEuropean Union delegation, in its capacity as observer, \r\nshould speak after all regional and major groupings \r\nthat are represented by States, unless the European \r\nUnion is also represented by a Member State. That is \r\na principled application of resolution 65/276. Hence, \r\nASEAN requests that an ASEAN member State, when \r\nspeaking on behalf of the grouping, should speak before \r\n12/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nthe European Union if the latter is represented by the \r\nEuropean Union delegation.\r\nTurning to agenda item 118, on the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the General Assembly, let me express our \r\nappreciation to the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly, Ambassador František Ružička of Slovakia \r\nand Ambassador Norachit Sinhaseni of Thailand, for \r\ntheir stewardship in facilitating the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup during the Assembly’s sixty-eighth session. \r\nWe are pleased by the progress made under their \r\nco-chairmanship. We are also pleased that resolution \r\n68/307 was adopted by consensus on 10 September \r\n2014. Let me also take this opportunity to express our \r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. John Ashe, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session, \r\nfor his selection of the co-Chairs and the importance \r\nhe accorded to the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We welcome the opening address \r\nby Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its current session, on 16 September 2014 \r\n(see A/69/PV.1), in which he highlighted his priorities, \r\nincluding the continued focus on both the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly and the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We look forward to working with the new \r\nCo-chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group appointed by \r\nMr. Kutesa.\r\nNext year we will celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations. That special occasion \r\nprovides us with a unique opportunity to reinvigorate \r\nthe reform of the United Nations. We should take \r\nadvantage of that opportunity not only to celebrate the \r\nachievements of the United Nations over the past seven \r\ndecades, but also to contemplate a fresh approach to the \r\nreform of the Organization in order to enable it to more \r\neffectively respond to the needs of Member States and \r\nto address both current and future challenges. \r\nOne critical component of that reform is the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich is the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations. Let me \r\nhighlight some of the key issues that we believe deserve \r\nspecial consideration in the sixty-ninth session.\r\nFirst, we welcome the reaffirmation, in accordance \r\nwith resolution 68/307, of the importance and benefit \r\nof continued interaction between the General Assembly \r\nand international and regional forums. The year \r\n2015 is special not only for the United Nations but \r\nalso for ASEAN, which next year will celebrate the \r\nestablishment of the ASEAN Community. As one of \r\nthe most successful regional organizations, ASEAN \r\nlooks forward to interacting with all international and \r\nregional forums to address issues of common interest \r\nand concern. I hope that concrete measures and actions \r\nwill be taken to follow up on the important directive \r\ngiven by the General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the General Assembly’s \r\ndecision, beginning with the seventieth session, to hold \r\nthe election for non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil and members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil approximately six months before the elected \r\nmembers assume their responsibilities. We hope that \r\nthe elected members, especially those from small and \r\nmedium-sized developing countries, will thereby have \r\nmore time to prepare for their new responsibilities. We \r\nparticularly hope that the earlier election will provide \r\nan earlier opportunity for the elected non-permanent \r\nmembers to observe Security Council meetings.\r\nThirdly, with respect to the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General, we welcome the \r\nreaffirmation in resolution 68/307 that the process of \r\nselecting and appointing the Secretary-General differs \r\nfrom that used for other executive heads in the United \r\nNations system, given the important and unique role \r\nof the Secretary-General. We appreciate the common \r\ncall by a number of Member States for the selection \r\nprocess to be improved without amending the Charter. \r\nFor example, convening hearings or meetings of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for an exchange of views with \r\ncandidates could help to make the selection process \r\nmore inclusive, transparent, interactive and credible. \r\nWe hope that concrete improvement will be agreed \r\nupon in the Ad Hoc Working Group during the sixty-\r\nninth session so that it can be implemented at the \r\nseventieth session, well in time for the selection of the \r\nnext Secretary-General, which is expected to take place \r\nin 2016. We also hope that the President of the General \r\nAssembly will play an active role in that process in \r\naccordance with the role accorded to him or her by \r\nthe relevant resolutions, while at the same time fully \r\nrespecting the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nLast but not least, we hope to see further \r\nstrengthening of the institutional memory of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly. We \r\nare pleased that the Assembly, in resolution 68/307, \r\nrepeated its request to the Secretary-General to submit, \r\nin the context of the proposed programme budget for \r\n14-63492 13/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nthe biennium 2016-2017, proposals to review the budget \r\nallocation to the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly in accordance with existing procedures.\r\nIt is important to note that a number of Member \r\nStates have continually called for an increase in the \r\nbudget allocation to the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which has remained unchanged \r\nsince 1998. With only minor adjustments for inflation, \r\nthat salary currently stands at $300,000. As one of the \r\nmost important multilateral posts, the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly, no matter which country holds \r\nthat important office, should not be under financial \r\nconstraints. We therefore hope that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals will be submitted and considered \r\nin the preparation for the next biennium.\r\nBefore concluding, let me repeat the words of \r\nMartin Luther King, Jr., that Mr. Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa cited in his opening address to the Assembly: \r\n“Everything that is done in the world is done by hope.” \r\nI have expressed our hopes, on behalf of ASEAN \r\nmember States, and wish to assure the Assembly of the \r\nAssociation’s continued commitment to constructively \r\nengage in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup during the sixty-ninth session, with the aim of \r\nachieving concrete outcomes for the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the Assembly on the eve of its seventieth \r\nanniversary.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): Pakistan associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Slovakia and Thailand as co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly during the sixty-\r\neighth session. We look forward to working with the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Namibia and Croatia as \r\nthey lead our efforts to revitalize the General Assembly.\r\nThe General Assembly, despite its perceived \r\noperational inaction, has been working diligently on \r\nits mandated tasks. The finalization of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals and the creation of the high-\r\nlevel political forum on sustainable development are \r\nexamples of its recent successes. Leadership on issues \r\nlike the Millennium Development Goals, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, human rights and women’s empowerment \r\nand the creation of new architecture such as the \r\nHuman Rights Council and UN-Women, testify to the \r\nnormative and substantive vitality and creativity of \r\nthe General Assembly over the past decade. The Ad \r\nHoc Working Group itself has succeeded in bringing \r\nforward elections for the members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the non-permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council to six months before the start of \r\ntheir terms. This will help the newly elected members \r\nprepare and contribute in a better way.\r\nThe roles and mandates of the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council have been defined clearly by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Instead of a discourse \r\nfocused on contradictions and encroachments, we \r\nshould look at areas of convergence so that the two \r\nbodies can work harmoniously in a shared space to \r\nadvance our common agenda. The Charter provides \r\nenormous space to the General Assembly to play its \r\nrole in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity, economic development and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. The Assembly should use \r\nthat space in an optimal manner. It has a leadership role \r\nto play on peacekeeping by using the full potential of \r\nthe Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. \r\nFrom time to time, resorting to the Uniting for Peace \r\nmechanism would enable the Assembly to leave its \r\nindelible imprint on international peace and stability.\r\nIn this millennium, the General Assembly would \r\nplay a landmark and seminal role by crafting the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, which would contribute \r\ndirectly to the alleviation of poverty, the empowerment \r\nof the marginalized men, women and children of the \r\nworld, promoting equality, and stimulating economic \r\ngrowth and development. The implementation of \r\nthe agenda would put the Assembly at the centre of \r\ndecision-making processes and enhance its structures \r\nand stature. In addition, the Assembly has the \r\nresponsibility to deliver on sustainable development \r\nin partnership with the high-level political forum on \r\nsustainable development and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil.\r\nThe Security Council, for its part, while taking up \r\nthematic issues, such as climate change, sexual violence \r\nin armed conflict, women and children’s rights and \r\npeacebuilding, should work in close partnership with the \r\nrelevant intergovernmental forums and organizations.\r\nTwo-way communication between the Council and \r\nthe Assembly should not remain symbolic and cosmetic \r\nbut should become substantive and consequential. \r\nSmall steps could improve communication between \r\nthe two bodies. These include making the largely pro \r\nforma monthly meetings between the Presidents of the \r\n14/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nGeneral Assembly and the Council more substantive \r\nby discussing collaboration, based on the agendas \r\nof the two bodies; making the annual reports of the \r\nCouncil to the Assembly more analytical and allowing \r\nthe Assembly’s views to feed back into the Council’s \r\nwork; and by having better scrutiny and evaluation of \r\nCouncil’s work by the general membership. \r\nLastly, the Ad Hoc Working Group, the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform and the General Assembly itself should work \r\nwith the Security Council and its Informal Working \r\nGroup on Documentation and Other Procedural \r\nQuestions to refine and improve the Security Council’s \r\nworking methods to make it more accountable and \r\ntransparent for the general membership.\r\nSecurity Council reform is an historic opportunity \r\nfor the General Assembly. This time, we should get \r\nthe reform process right. It should not be a partial \r\nand lopsided reform, focusing on increasing the \r\nmembership, especially permanent seats. The reform \r\nhas to focus on increasing representation, as well as \r\non other equally important matters — the veto, size \r\nand working methods, regional representation and the \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe General Assembly should not allow the \r\ncreation of new permanent seats because that would be \r\na negation of its own democratic character. It should \r\npursue the principle of the greatest good of the greatest \r\nnumber by ensuring that all Member States — small, \r\nmedium-sized and large — that make up the family of \r\nthe United Nations are adequately and appropriately \r\nrepresented in the reformed Council. Council reform \r\nshould reflect the aspirations and interests of all, not \r\nthe ambitions of a few.\r\nThe faithful implementation of General Assembly \r\nresolutions and decisions requires two essential \r\nconditions: the critical political will of Member \r\nStates and adequate resources. Appropriate measures \r\nshould be taken to avoid the selective implementation \r\nof resolutions, by design or by default. Updating the \r\ninventory of resolutions is a good practice, and the \r\nSecretariat has done a good job in this regard. The \r\nmechanism should, however, be further improved \r\nby including information on the reasons for \r\nnon-implementation or delay. The Secretariat may also \r\nexplore the establishment of a unit to track instances of \r\nnon-implementation.\r\nAs we move towards the selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in 2016, a major challenge will be to meet \r\nthe expectations of Member States with regard to the \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness of the process. The Ad \r\nHoc Working Group should pursue this as an important \r\nobjective this year.\r\nFinally, the United Nations is the sum of its \r\nMember States. The revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and the faithful implementation of its \r\ndecisions and resolutions would act as force multiplier \r\nin empowering the United Nations to resolve difficult \r\nissues of peace and security, development and human \r\nrights. We are glad that a statesman of your stature and \r\nwisdom, Mr. President, will lead our efforts during this \r\nmomentous year.\r\nMr. Minami (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank you, Mr. President, for your initiative on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nLike the other delegations, I would also like to extend \r\nmy sincere gratitude to the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly during the previous session, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Slovakia and Thailand, \r\nand welcome the appointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Croatia and Namibia as the new \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group during the \r\ncurrent session.\r\nBoth in your acceptance speech (see A/68/PV.93) in \r\nJune and in your speech at the opening of the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-ninth session (see A/69/PV.1) in September, \r\nMr. President, you emphasized the importance of \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. Japan completely \r\nshares your views. Revitalizing the General Assembly \r\nand Security Council reform are crucial components \r\nof the reform agenda. We must make steady progress \r\ntowards achieving feasible and realistic results on this \r\nitem.\r\nIn this context, Japan welcomes the adoption \r\nof resolution 68/307 during the previous session. \r\nIn particular, the decision to hold the elections for \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council earlier is highly regarded. We believe it \r\nwill definitely resolve the legitimate concerns of newly \r\nelected members. It is also an achievement that the \r\nresolution says the General Assembly decides to reiterate \r\nthe interim arrangement recommending the pattern for \r\nthe rotation of the Chairs of the Main Committees from \r\nthe sixty-ninth to the seventy-third sessions.\r\n14-63492 15/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nIt is true that in previous sessions we made some \r\nachievements regarding the revitalization of the work \r\nof the General Assembly. However, much more has to \r\nbe done and much more effort is needed. Enhancing \r\nfairness in the management of this United Nations body \r\nremains an important aspect for discussion. We argued \r\nlast year during this same occasion that the speakers \r\nlist during the high-level week should more closely \r\nreflect reality. Countries like mine, Japan, in which the \r\nHead of State plays a ceremonial role and the Head of \r\nGovernment has the highest political mandate, should \r\nbe dealt with as such. It is appreciated that this year \r\nthe Assembly has reflected on our argument to some \r\nextent.\r\nWe would also like to stress the importance of strict \r\nadherence to time restraints for each speaker. In this \r\nregard, it is highly appreciated that President Kutesa \r\nstarts each meeting on time. The General Assembly \r\nneeds to continue discussions to achieve disciplined \r\nmanagement.\r\nThe rationalization of the General Assembly’s \r\nwork is an urgent challenge. As the amount of tasks in \r\nthe Assembly has increased, agenda prioritization has \r\nbeen indispensable. By sorting through more than 170 \r\nagenda items, as well as through the biennialization \r\nand triennialization of agenda items that are currently \r\nbeing discussed every year, the work of the Assembly \r\nshould be rationalized. However, the process still has a \r\nlong way to go. For instance, late-night sessions have \r\nbecome more common in some Main Committees. \r\nWe hope that such situations will be improved upon \r\nimmediately.\r\nThe President’s strong initiative in hosting the \r\nhigh-level meetings next year is appreciated. In order \r\nto make these meetings even more high profile, I would \r\nlike to suggest they be more distinct from similar \r\ninternational conferences and meetings,so that senior \r\nrepresentatives from each capital can attend. \r\nThe importance of exercising the leadership of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly should also be noted. \r\nConsidering United Nations budget restraints, Member \r\nStates should support the activities of the President as \r\nmuch as possible.\r\nThese are some ideas Japan believes are worth \r\ndiscussing under this agenda item. The revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly is, together with the reform \r\nof the Security Council, an important task that we have \r\nto address. Let me finalize my statement by saying \r\nthat Japan stands ready to contribute in a constructive \r\nway to the discussions aimed at further enhancing the \r\neffectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): I thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor convening this important meeting. \r\nAt the outset, let me to align myself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nI would like to express our appreciation for \r\nthe good work done by the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly during the previous session, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Slovakia and Thailand. I also wish to \r\ncongratulate the Permanent Representatives of Namibia \r\nand Croatia for their appointments as co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group during the sixty-ninth session \r\nand wish them success in this endeavour.\r\nWe believe that the issue of General Assembly \r\nrevitalization has assumed particular significance \r\nin recent years. This is quite vividly captured in the \r\nemphasis which you, Mr. President, have placed on \r\nUnited Nations reform, including the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly and reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. In your acceptance speech in June, you rightly \r\npointed out that,\r\n“Today, the world is vastly different from what \r\nit was in 1945. While the principles of the \r\nOrganization remain solid, the changing world \r\nobliges us to adjust to new and changing realities. \r\nCentral to that is the continued revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil and other relevant United Nations bodies.” \r\n(A/68/PV.93, p. 2)\r\nSimilarly, we also believe that urgent and \r\ncomprehensive United Nations reform is imperative \r\nto make it ref lective of current geopolitical realities \r\nand to enhance its capability to meet the increasingly \r\ncomplex and pressing transnational challenges of our \r\ntime. Those include the issues of peace and security, \r\ndevelopment, human rights, the environment and \r\nhealth, among others. We appreciate the importance \r\nthat you, Mr. President, have attached to those issues. \r\nYou can count on India’s support in those endeavours \r\nof yours.\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly will not be \r\nempowered merely by strengthening procedures and \r\nstreamlining working methods. It will be empowered \r\n16/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nonly if its position as the chief deliberative, policy-\r\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations, \r\nunder Article 10 of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nis respected in letter and in spirit. This requires that \r\nthe Assembly take the lead in setting the global agenda \r\nand restoring the centrality of the United Nations \r\nin formulating multilateral approaches to resolving \r\ntransnational issues. In particular, revitalization \r\nmust restore the primacy of the United Nations in \r\ndevelopment matters. We would like to make three \r\npoints in this context. \r\nFirst, it is critical to address the issue of preventing \r\nencroachment on the mandate of the General Assembly \r\nand making the Security Council more responsive \r\nto it. The Council’s encroachment on issues that \r\ntraditionally fall within the Assembly’s competence \r\nis of particular concern. The consequent undermining \r\nof the Assembly’s  role and authority needs to be \r\nredressed. Resorting to thematic debates and, of late, \r\nresolutions in the Security Council on issues that very \r\noften fall within the purview of the General Assembly \r\nor the Economic and Social Council remains an area of \r\nconcern. The balance among the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, as stipulated by the Charter, must be \r\nrespected and maintained.\r\nSecondly, the General Assembly, being the voice \r\nof the international community, must be given a \r\ngreater say in the selection of the Secretary-General. \r\nThe continued circumscribing of the Assembly’s role \r\nand responsibilities in the process of the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General needs to change. \r\nThis is in the interests of the United Nations system in \r\ngeneral and the Assembly’s prerogatives in particular. \r\nEfforts to put in place a more inclusive and transparent \r\nprocedure for the appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, consistent with Article 97 of the Charter, need \r\nto be undertaken without further delay.\r\nThirdly, the Assembly and the other entities that \r\nform part of the United Nations system must reflect \r\nbest practices in their day-to-day functioning. This will \r\nrequire a review of the way the Assembly conducts its \r\nbusiness, including, for example, the recently concluded \r\nelections to the International Court of Justice.\r\nOur attention is also drawn to the fact that the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council (A/69/53) is being \r\ndebated both in the plenary and the Third Committee. \r\nSome delegations that spoke on this subject in this \r\nplenary yesterday, for example, even as I speak are \r\nmaking the same statements in the Third Committee \r\ntoday. This is perhaps not fruitful.\r\nIn our view, the primacy of the Assembly f lows \r\nfrom the universality of its membership, as well as the \r\ndiligent application of the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of its members. Therefore, ownership, of the \r\nAssembly’s decisions and activities is reflected in the \r\ndegree of the participation by Member States. So, the \r\npresence of political will on the part of Member States \r\nto take on concrete measures to reinforce the role and \r\nauthority of the Assembly is of utmost importance.\r\nIn conclusion, let me re-emphasize the need to \r\ndiscuss substantive measures that would strengthen the \r\nrole of the General Assembly as the chief deliberative, \r\npolicy-making and representative body of the \r\ninternational community. Members can count on my \r\ndelegation’s constructive support and participation in \r\nthese efforts.\r\nMr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We welcome today’s meeting on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. I \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Croatia and Namibia on their \r\nappointments as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly and wish them every success in their work. \r\nWe note the work of the Permanent Representatives of \r\nSlovakia and Thailand as co-Chairs during the sixty-\r\neighth session.\r\nThe Russian Federation supports realistic \r\ninitiatives aimed at improving the effectiveness of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s work, on the condition that we \r\nremain focused on improving the Assembly’s working \r\nmethods and streamlining its agenda, which is largely \r\noverburdened. We believe that it is necessary to \r\ncontinue the practice of transferring some agenda items \r\nfrom consideration on a biennial basis to a triennial \r\nschedule and of eliminating items that are no longer \r\nrelevant.\r\nWe endorse the proposals on lightening the high-\r\nlevel week in the framework of the general debate, \r\nbecause during their stay in New York, Heads of State \r\nand Government, a well as ministers for foreign affairs, \r\nalready have a busy schedule of bilateral meetings. We \r\nmust limit the number of high-level events during that \r\nperiod. The rest should be carried out systematically \r\nthroughout the full Assembly session. That will \r\nfacilitate and improve the efficiency of our work.\r\n14-63492 17/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nAt the same time, we believe that any reform \r\ninnovations should be based on strict compliance with \r\nthe prerogatives of the principal organs of the United \r\nNations, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn particular, we call for maintaining the current role of \r\nthe General Assembly in the selection and appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General, pursuant to Article 97 \r\nof the Charter, according to which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is appointed by the General Assembly on the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council.\r\nWe must carefully consider proposals to strengthen \r\nthe institutional memory of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly. However, we note that, as with \r\nany other issue that might have financial implications \r\nfor the regular budget of the United Nations, it should \r\nbe addressed in full compliance with the generally \r\naccepted procedure, that is, in the Fifth Committee \r\nand the Advisory Committee on Administrative and \r\nBudgetary Questions.\r\nMr. Elhamamy (Egypt): Egypt associates itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to express Egypt’s \r\nappreciation for your decision, Mr. President, to \r\ninclude the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly at the top of your priorities during the sixty-\r\nninth session, and for stressing the need to do more to \r\nmake the Assembly effective and efficient. I seize this \r\nopportunity to thank the Permanent Representatives of \r\nSlovakia and Thailand for their efforts in co-chairing \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly during the sixty-\r\neighth session. Those efforts led to the adoption of \r\nresolution 68/307, which represents a strong basis for \r\nthe discussions during the current session under the \r\nleadership of the newly appointed co-facilitators. We \r\npledge our full support to them to achieve tangible \r\nresults in the process of revitalizing the work of the \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe international community is confronted with \r\nunprecedented challenges that necessitate a strong and \r\nresponsive General Assembly in order to allow this \r\nuniversal parliament of nations to play its leading role \r\nin global governance at the political, economic and \r\nsocial levels. Egypt believes that the first step to achieve \r\ntangible progress in this regard is to implement various \r\nresolutions containing specific measures to revitalize \r\nthe work of the Assembly as the main deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative principal organ of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFurthermore, we think that the main challenge facing \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nis the continuous and unprecedented encroachment \r\nby the Security Council on the Assembly’s role \r\nand functions. The Security Council is constantly \r\nattempting to redefine its scope of competence through \r\na wider interpretation of what issues constitute a threat \r\nto international peace and security, including issues \r\nthat are already under consideration in the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council. The \r\nAd Hoc Working Group could identify those areas of \r\nencroachment and also areas of coordination between \r\nthose two principal organs during its upcoming \r\ndeliberations – for example, how to enhance the \r\ncoordination between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council in the admission of new Members to \r\nthe United Nations pursuant to Article 4, paragraph 2 \r\nof the Charter.\r\nWe stress that focusing only on the procedural \r\naspects and working methods of the General Assembly \r\nwill not suffice in leading to the comprehensive \r\nimprovement of the Assembly’s work that we all aspire \r\nto. Ensuring the effectiveness of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly is also important to \r\nimprove the Assembly’s  role and authority. We reiterate \r\nthe need to strengthen the Office of the President \r\nthrough the allocation of more human and financial \r\nresources from the regular budget for the biennium \r\n2016-2017 in order to allow equal opportunities for all \r\nMember States to successfully manage the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly, since voluntary contributions \r\ntend to involve unpredictable and unreliable financing, \r\nwhich has a negative effect on the institutional memory \r\nof this Office.\r\nFinally, the selection and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General is yet another issue of great interest \r\nto the wider membership. We note that the selection \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General will \r\ntake place in 2016. We encourage the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to actively support the process in \r\naccordance with the role accorded to him by relevant \r\nresolutions, taking into consideration Article 97 of \r\nthe Charter. Moreover, we re-emphasize the need for \r\nthe selection process for the Secretary-General to be \r\ntransparent and inclusive of all Member States at an \r\nearly stage when identifying candidates for this key \r\npost.\r\n18/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nTthe revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nis a critical component of the overall reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. Therefore, it must be treated on equal \r\nfooting with other reform processes of the United \r\nNations principal organs and should be given greater \r\nattention and consideration. I would like to assure you, \r\nMr. President, of the full support of the delegation of \r\nmy country for all your efforts in order to enhance \r\nthe role of the General Assembly in achieving peace, \r\nstability and prosperity for all.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): Let me begin by thanking \r\nyou, Mr. President, for convening this important \r\ndebate on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly. We wish to thank Ambassador Ružička \r\nof Slovakia and Ambassador Sinhaseni of Thailand \r\nfor their valuable leadership of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly and their hard work during the sixty-eighth \r\nsession.\r\nWe also congratulate the new co-facilitators, \r\nAmbassador Drobnjak of Croatia and Ambassador Emvula of \r\nNamibia. The Indonesian delegation assures them of its \r\nwholehearted support in their stewardship of the Working \r\nGroup’s work to help realize a General Assembly that can \r\nbecome a powerful pivot for achieving a more peaceful \r\nand prosperous world for all people.\r\nIndonesia associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and of Cambodia on behalf of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nAs the seventieth anniversary of our United Nations \r\napproaches next year, this debate and the forthcoming \r\nsessions of the Working Group are very important in \r\ntaking stock of the revitalization efforts thus far and \r\ndeliberating on how a more robust, widespread and \r\ndedicated undertaking that strengthens the Assembly’s \r\nfunctioning can be developed. Certainly, since General \r\nAssembly revitalization became a distinct agenda item \r\nin 1991, and following the 2005 World Summit, at \r\nwhich the Ad Hoc Working Group was formed, much \r\nimportant work — with some results — has transpired \r\nunder the Group’s four thematic clusters, for which the \r\nGroup can rightly be proud.\r\nYet the Assembly has yet to truly be the chief \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ \r\nof the United Nations, as envisaged in the Charter. \r\nThere remains a gap in ensuring that the Assembly \r\nwill indeed be the universal parliament of nations, with \r\ncorresponding influence on international affairs of \r\nconcern to its membership.\r\nMy delegation has participated actively in the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group over the years. In the meetings in \r\nthe past session, very important discussions took place \r\nwith the Chairs of the Main Committees on improving \r\nthe Committees’ working methods, deepening the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, improving the selection and \r\nappointment process of the Secretaries-General and \r\nother United Nations executive heads, and enhancing \r\nthe Assembly’s role and authority.\r\nUnquestionably, Indonesia stands for meaningful \r\nprogress on the aforementioned issues, because our \r\ndomestic stakeholders demand such progress. We will \r\ncontinue to play our role in advancing the Group’s \r\nefforts to support the Assembly in assuming its rightful \r\nplace in global affairs in an effective manner. \r\nHowever, the Group can only do so much. While its \r\nmeetings and processes, including the inventory chart \r\nof decisions and actions that accompanies the Group’s \r\nannual reports, remain highly useful in monitoring and \r\norienting efforts to bolster the Assembly’s status, the \r\nAssembly’s revitalization is fundamentally a political \r\nprocess. It will require significantly greater political \r\nresolve by everyone, with sincere implementation of \r\nexisting Assembly resolutions on revitalization.\r\nResolution 68/307, adopted by consensus on \r\n10 September 2014, reflects the willingness of \r\nthe Member States to reinforce the gravity of the \r\nAssembly’s reform and to bolster its functioning as an \r\ninvaluable principal organ of the United Nations. It is \r\nin that context that we wish to reiterate the importance \r\nof the General Assembly’s role and scope, in particular \r\nin the realm of international peace and security. We \r\nindeed believe that the Assembly can be more assertive \r\nin assuming its rightful role on issues of peace and \r\nsecurity, which all members need to support. We are \r\nconcerned by the continuing shift to the Security \r\nCouncil of issues that traditionally fall within the \r\npurview of the General Assembly. All Member States, \r\nin our view, should and must have a stake and a say in \r\nissues pertaining to international peace and security.\r\nIf we work together better, cooperate more and, \r\nmost importantly, are ready to exercise our respective \r\npolitical principles to empower the General Assembly \r\nto fully perform its Charter-mandated role, we have \r\nno doubt that the much-sought-after and effective \r\n14-63492 19/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nrevitalization of the Assembly will indeed materialize. \r\nIndonesia calls upon all countries to display their \r\npolitical will and support the Working Group’s work to \r\nhelp attain a General Assembly that is able to optimally \r\nheed the calls by the entire spectrum of the international \r\ncommunity in all social, political, peace and security \r\ndimensions.\r\nMr. Raja Zaib Shah (Malaysia): At the outset, \r\nallow me to commend the Permanent Representatives of \r\nNamibia and Croatia on their appointments as co-chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly at the sixty-ninth session. \r\nLet me also express my appreciation to Mr. František \r\nRužička, Permanent Representative of Slovakia, and \r\nMr. Norachit Sinhaseni, Permanent Representative of \r\nThailand, for their stewardship in the discussion in the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group during the sixty-eight session.\r\nI wish to align my statement with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Cambodia on behalf \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. My \r\ndelegation would like to highlight some pertinent views \r\non this agenda item in our collective pursuit of the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nMalaysia has remained consistent in reiterating \r\nthat the General Assembly is the chief deliberative, \r\npolicymaking and representative organ of the United \r\nNations, and in highlighting the Asembly’s role in \r\nthe process of standard-setting and the codification \r\nof international law. The Assembly represents 193 \r\nMember States, and therefore we must duly accord it \r\nthe rightful and authoritative place it deserves. We must \r\nensure that the General Assembly continues its role as \r\nthe principal policymaking and norm-setting organ of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Working Group made significant \r\nstrides during the sixty-eighth session of the Assembly. \r\nMalaysia was happy to see the adoption of resolution \r\n68/307, on advancing the work of the Working Group. \r\nOne important development is the inclusion of \r\nparagraph 17 in the resolution, in which the General \r\nAssembly has agreed to conduct the elections of the \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council and \r\nthe members of the Economic and Social Council \r\nsix months before the elected members assume their \r\nresponsibilities, beginning at the seventieth session. \r\nThat will allow new members to plan ahead and to \r\nincrease their missions’ capacity before assuming their \r\nresponsibility and enabling their preparations.\r\nWhile we have made some significant progress, \r\nmy delegation is still concerned with the lack \r\nof implementation of various General Assembly \r\nresolutions. That has incapacitated the Assembly, as \r\nit undermines the effectiveness of the body. Malaysia \r\nappreciates the Assembly’s decision to evaluate the \r\nstatus of implementation of its resolutions and to \r\nbuild on the progress achieved in past sessions. We \r\nwelcome the decision that the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nwill continue its review of the inventory of Assembly \r\nresolutions on revitalization and to update the inventory \r\nchart annexed to those resolutions. That is the first step \r\nin realizing the implementation of all General Assembly \r\nresolutions.\r\nApart from that, my delegation also believes \r\nthat we should consider further deliberations on the \r\nbiennialization and triennialization of resolutions. \r\nMalaysia is of the view that that would improve \r\nthe work of the General Assembly through a better \r\nscheduling of agenda items. We call on those who call \r\nfor the biennialization and triennialization of agenda \r\nitems and resolutions to lead by example. In pursuit of \r\nthat effort, it is vital that the sponsoring State or States \r\nconsent to such measures prior to implementation.\r\nWithout a doubt, the General Assembly today \r\nconsiders a greater number of agenda items and issues \r\nthan previously. The increasing number of agenda \r\nitems and issues also means the role and activities of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly will continue \r\nto increase over the years to come. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation wishes to call for the President to be allocated \r\nthe necessary resources for him or her to perform the \r\nrole entrusted to the Office by the Charter of the United \r\nNations. At the same time, Malaysia also welcomes the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group’s proposal to strengthen the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office of the President and \r\nits relationship with the Secretariat.\r\nMalaysia would also like to highlight the need for \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness in the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral represents all States Members of the United \r\nNations, and not exclusively Security Council members. \r\nTherefore, the selection process for that important \r\npersonality must respect the aspirations of Member \r\nStates. We call for the implementation of past resolutions \r\non the issue, especially paragraphs 17 to 22 of the annex to \r\nresolution 60/286, in future selections and appointments \r\nof the Secretary-General and in view of the selection and \r\nappointment of the next Secretary-General in 2016.\r\n20/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nMalaysia welcomes the convening of high-level \r\nmeetings and high-level thematic debates on issues \r\nthat are important to Member States. We believe that \r\nthere needs to be greater coordination with all relevant \r\nparties in organizing such meetings so as to avoid or \r\nat least minimize scheduling problems for delegations, \r\nespecially during the high-level week of the General \r\nAssembly. We look forward to the implementation of \r\nthe proposal to resolve the problem of having too many \r\nmeetings and events during the high-level week, such \r\nas exploring the possibility of scheduling such meetings \r\nduring the early part of the year.\r\nWe must take note of the progress we have made \r\nthus far in our collective quest to revitalize the General \r\nAssembly. Member States must be reminded that the \r\nwork of revitalization of the Assembly is not new, \r\nnor will it end anytime soon. We must continue to \r\npress on for further deliberations and to maintain the \r\nmomentum in order to attain meaningful progress. \r\nWe invite Member States to approach this issue with \r\nopenness and demonstrate the political will necessary \r\nto enable us to make real substantial progress on further \r\nenhancing the effectiveness of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Cuban delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and would like to make a few \r\nadditional comments on this topic.\r\nI would first like to thank the co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly for preparing resolution \r\n68/307 on this subject and for their efforts to advance \r\nthe process of revitalization of the Assembly. We would \r\nalso like to congratulate the representatives of Namibia \r\nand Croatia for their appointment as co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is a \r\ncritical element in achieving true reform of the United \r\nNations. At the present time, it will not be possible to \r\naddress the overall process of United Nations reform \r\nif we do not prioritize the objective of ensuring a more \r\ndemocratic and effective Organization that has at its \r\ncentre a General Assembly that fully exercises the \r\npowers assigned to it under the Charter. Cuba has stated \r\non many occasions that this process of revitalization \r\nshould seek to recover and strengthen the Assembly’s \r\ncentral role as the chief deliberative, policymaking \r\nand representative body of the United Nations, as \r\nrecognized in the Charter and numerous resolutions \r\nand declarations adopted by the United Nations.\r\nIn the present circumstances, the goals of the \r\nrevitalization process should be directed towards \r\nhelping the Assembly strengthen its independence and \r\nits nature as a comprehensive debate body, in which \r\nthe freedom of Member States to consider matters of \r\ninterest to them is not restricted or limited. To restore \r\nthe confidence of the international community in the \r\nUnited Nations and its credibility in the global public \r\nopinion, we should ensure that our Organization truly \r\nresponds to the collective interests of its Member States. \r\nThat can be achieved only if we revitalize the guiding \r\nrole of the General Assembly, the only organ of the \r\nUnited Nations where there is no place for hegemony, \r\nwhere everyone has a say and a vote, and where the \r\nobsolete right to the veto does not exist.\r\nThe General Assembly has the ability, de facto \r\nand de jure, to consider crucial and urgent topics \r\nof international reality in order to adopt concrete, \r\naction-oriented resolutions. In our opinion, the \r\nOrganization’s main problem is precisely the lack of \r\nimplementation of the many Assembly resolutions, \r\nwhich constitute an important set of standards but \r\nare not always applied because their implementation \r\ndepends on the political will of States. That also applies \r\nto the many resolutions on the very subject of Assembly \r\nrevitalization, the execution of which is unfortunately \r\nvery limited.\r\nCuba stresses the need to find an appropriate balance \r\namong the principal organs of the United Nations, in \r\naccordance with the Charter, and to put an end to the \r\ngrowing trend of the Security Council to address issues \r\nthat fall within the jurisdiction of General Assembly \r\nor another principal organ of the Organization. The \r\nSecurity Council should strictly observe the mandate \r\nconferred on it by the Charter and resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in its capacity as a principal organ \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly cannot \r\nbe a bureaucratic process. As Padre Miguel d’Escoto \r\nBrockmann, of the sister Republic of Nicaragua, wisely \r\nstated in his farewell address as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-third session, revitalization is a \r\npolitical rather than a technical issue (see A/63/PV.105). \r\nWe hope that as a result of the revitalization process, \r\ninteraction between the Secretariat and the Assembly \r\nwill be strengthened so that the former can respond \r\nmore effectively to the mandates set by Member States.\r\nThe Ad Hoc Working Group on Revitalization \r\nmust maintain strict control over the implementation \r\n14-63492 21/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nof resolutions related to its mandate and maintain the \r\nappropriate updated inventory chart, which includes \r\nresolutions relating to the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly. We already possess a broad legal arsenal \r\nwith respect to the needed revitalization of this essential \r\norgan. The priority now is to amplify the numerous \r\nresolutions already adopted and to move forward \r\ndecisively towards the practical implementation of the \r\nreform process. \r\nWe must urgently take specific, practical steps in \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nThe Organizatin will not be capable of acting effectively \r\nwithin the system of contemporary international \r\nrelations without reforming the Security Council and \r\nmaking the General Assembly the centre of multilateral \r\ndebate and work.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba would like to close by \r\nreiterating its readiness to continue to work together to \r\nachieve the true revitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Hamilton (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States would like to thank last year’s co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly — the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovakia, Mr. František Ružička, and \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Thailand, Mr. Norachit \r\nSinhaseni — for their leadership of the Group. We \r\nwelcome the new co-Chairs, Ambassador Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak of Croatia and Ambassador Wilfried I. \r\nEmvula of Namibia, and offer them our full support. \r\nWe also look forward to working with fellow Member \r\nStates as we consider the best options for revitalizing \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nDuring the sixty-eighth session, the Working Group \r\ndiscussed many issues of paramount importance to the \r\nefficacy of the General Assembly, which we strongly \r\nhope will continue in the sixty-ninth session under the \r\nleadership of our esteemed co-Chairs. We believe that \r\nthe Assembly is a unique body of great importance \r\nin today’s world — a fact that was emphasized by the \r\nattendance of world leaders at the general debate in \r\nSeptember, as well as the by day-to-day work of all our \r\ncolleagues here today.\r\nIn order to ensure that the General Assembly \r\nmaintains its unique status among the world’s \r\ndeliberative bodies, the United States believes that we \r\nmust increase the Assembly’s efficiency, effectiveness \r\nand transparency. To do so, we must streamline and \r\nprioritize the agenda, improve the practices and \r\nworking methods of the Main Committees, and free \r\nthe Assembly’s agenda of outdated topics in order to \r\nallocate more time to addressing important, pressing \r\nand contemporary issues. Those should be among the \r\nWorking Group’s highest priorities. By suggesting \r\nkey areas for tangible improvement of the Assembly’s \r\nworking methods, the Working Group can maintain its \r\nfocus on aspects of revitalization that will result in a \r\nreal difference for the work of the General Assembly.\r\nWe recognize that many delegations continue to \r\nfocus on other aspects of the Assembly’s work, such as \r\nthe role and authority of the President of the General \r\nAssembly, the working methods of the Security Council \r\nor the process to select the Secretary-General. While \r\nthese are important topics, we do not believe that they \r\nshould be the primary focus of the Working Group’s \r\nefforts. The Charter of the United Nations makes clear \r\nthe coequal relationship between the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council, which should be respected.\r\nIn our view, the selection process for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has already been adequately addressed. Article \r\n97 of the Charter provides a straightforward and clear \r\nprocess.\r\nThe United States is fully committed to multilateral \r\nengagement in a strong United Nations system. We \r\nsupport the contributions of the General Assembly in \r\nthat regard. Accordingly, our delegation has made it \r\na priority to make the work of the General Assembly \r\nmore focused and relevant. We call on Member States \r\nto refocus their attention on efforts to reform the \r\nAsssembly’s working methods.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to working closely with \r\nyou, Mr. President, the co-Chairs, and our counterparts \r\nfrom other delegations towards a constructive dialogue \r\nfor concrete reform.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would like first of all to commend the \r\nremarkable work and tireless efforts of Mr. František \r\nRužička and Mr. Norachit Sinhaseni, Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Slovakia and Thailand, respectively, \r\nfor their role as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Working Methods \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session. We \r\nalso take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak, Permanent Representative of Croatia, and \r\nMr. Wilfried Emvula, Permanent Representative of \r\nNambia, on their recent appointment as facilitators of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group, and to assure them of our \r\nfull cooperation.\r\n22/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nMy delegation would like to associate itself with \r\nthe statement delivered on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nToday’s debate addresses an issue that occupies \r\na central place in the reform of the United Nations. It \r\ninvolves the major challenges that concern us, namely, \r\nthe balance between the organs of the United Nations; \r\nthe role, responsibility and effectiveness of the General \r\nAssembly; and the modernization of its working \r\nmethods. The General Assembly holds a central place \r\nas the primary deliberative organ tasked with setting the \r\ndirection of the Organization,  defining international \r\neconomic, social and cultural cooperation; and \r\nestablishing norms and codifying the implementation \r\nof international law.\r\nFor the past 20 years, the Assembly has adopted \r\nvarious measures to strengthen its role and authority, \r\nas well as those of its President. The Assembly has also \r\nsought to refocus its work in order to better address \r\ncontemporary and future global challenges such \r\nas strengthening international peace and security, \r\ncombating the ever-growing phenomenon of terrorism, \r\nstrengthening the means to prevent and combat the \r\nre-emergence of crises and conflicts, and preventing \r\nthe deterioration of our environment and biodiversity. \r\nFurthermore, the countdown has begun. Within the next \r\nfew months, world leaders must adopt a programme for \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, agreeing on new \r\ndevelopment goals designed to improve the people’s \r\nlives and protect our planet for future generations.\r\nThe recent resolutions adopted by the General \r\nAssembly have made possible a certain degree of \r\nprogress towards the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. However, much remains to be done. \r\nThe strategic objectives on which we need to continue \r\nto work include improving the practices and working \r\nmethods of the Main Committees; strengthening the role \r\nof the Office of the President of the General Assembly \r\nand providing it with a permanent structure in order to \r\npreserve the institutional memory of the Assembly and \r\nto enable the President to more effectively discharge \r\nthe functions with which he has been entrusted; \r\nconsolidating the role and authority of the President; \r\nand more efficiently organizing the Assembly’s agenda.\r\nAchieving those objectives will make the main \r\ndeliberative organ a strong, credible and effective body \r\nthat is able to meet the new challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century and to contribute to building a peaceful, \r\nmore prosperous and more just world. That work must be \r\nconducted with respect for the provisions of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and for the balance it establishes, \r\nparticularly between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, in order to preserve the harmonious \r\nrelationship between those two principal organs and to \r\navoid any interference or encroachment. \r\nA bigger effort at rationalization is needed in order \r\nto fill the gaps, avoid redundancies and strengthen \r\nthe Assembly’s effectiveness, while bearing in mind \r\nthe need to rationalize the financial aspects of the \r\nOrganization. That revitalization effort should include \r\na search for ways and means to make more effective the \r\nwork of the various subsidiary organs of the Assembly, \r\nparticularly its Main Committees.\r\nWe should not lose sight of the fact that through the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and the reform of \r\nthe Security Council, the international community seeks \r\nto restore and strengthen confidence in multilateralism, \r\nand thereby in the United Nations, as the proper \r\nframework to ensure fair and equal consideration of \r\nthe legitimate interests and aspirations of all Member \r\nStates. Promoting the revitalization process requires \r\nthe commitment of all Member States and unwavering \r\npolitical will to advance multilateralism and its noble \r\nobjectives.\r\nFinally, the establishment of effective and fair \r\ngovernance remains dependant on revitalizing the \r\nUnited Nations system on the basis of realism, \r\neffectiveness and innovation as the key parameters in \r\nthe search for solutions that meet the aspirations of both \r\npresent and future generations.\r\nMrs. Zarrouk Boumiza (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the representatives \r\nof Slovakia and Thailand for their efforts in co-chairing \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly. \r\nMy delegation concurs with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement. We would also like to make \r\nthe following comments. \r\nWith regard to strengthening the role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly, we believe that revitalization \r\nis one of the pillars of the comprehensive reform of \r\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly is the main \r\ndeliberative organ of the Organization. It plays a role \r\nin the codification of international law and addresses \r\nadministrative and budgetary issues.  We must redouble \r\nour efforts to revitalize the Assembly. Indeed, we must \r\n14-63492 23/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\ncontinue to review resolutions on the subject, as they \r\nrepresent important criteria for assessing progress. \r\nMy delegation believes that strengthening \r\nthe Assembly’s role also requires considering the \r\nviewpoints and interests of all countries and the \r\ninternational community as a whole. The Assembly \r\nmust assist in dealing with emerging challenges. We \r\nmust also accelerate efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals as we approach 2015. \r\nMy delegation also highlights the importance of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s continuing to organize thematic \r\ndebates as a tool to enable the international community \r\nto exchange opinions and views on important issues. \r\nWe are convinced that such debates will continue at this \r\nsession and result in pragmatic, concrete results. My \r\ndelegation also underscores the importance of follow-\r\nup. \r\nStrengthening the work of the General Assembly \r\nalso involves recognizing its role in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations attributes the major responsibility in \r\nthat area to the Security Council, but my delegation \r\nbelieves that this authority is not absolute. We believe \r\nthat the Assembly should respond more quickly on \r\nissues related to international peace and security. \r\nWe also believe that the contents of the annual \r\nSecurity Council report should be improved. The report \r\nshould be more analytical and in-depth and should \r\nreflect the context of decision-making, keeping in mind \r\nsituations for which no solution was found. \r\nWe believe it important to hold periodic meetings \r\namong the heads of the main bodies and that countries \r\nmust be kept informed of such meetings. I also note \r\nthe importance of strengthening cooperation among the \r\nmain bodies, including with respect to their respective \r\nprogrammes of work, with a view to strengthening \r\ncomplementarity.\r\nRegarding the working methods of the Assembly \r\nand their improvement, my delegation notes that a \r\nnumber of measures that have been taken have led to \r\nimprovements in that respect, including the convening of \r\nhigh-level meetings. However, we must engage in more \r\nin-depth discussion of a number of recommendations, \r\nin particular concerning the appointment of Committee \r\nChairs with sufficient advance notice; planning shorter \r\nmeeting; exchanging best practices, bearing in mind the \r\nspecificities of each of the Main Committees; avoiding \r\nsimultaneous meetings of the General Assembly and \r\nthe other main bodies with respect to agenda items; and \r\ncoordinating the planning of high-level meetings. \r\nWe thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis efforts to strengthen the overall role of the United \r\nNations and to consult with Member States in a spirit \r\nof transparency and cooperation, in order to develop a \r\ncommon vision to enable the Organization to attain the \r\ngoals set by the international community. \r\nWe also call for improving the process of electing \r\nand appointing the executive heads of the United \r\nNations bodies. In that regard, we should take into \r\naccount the recommendations of the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit on interviews for candidates, as well as the \r\nprinciple of equitable geographic distribution in such \r\nappointments. \r\nWith respect to the support to be given to the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly, it \r\nmust be sufficient so that the President can deal with \r\nhis areas of responsibility. Moreover, the duties of that \r\nOffice should not increase financial burden on lower \r\nincome States. However, it is important to maintain the \r\nOrganization’s institutional memory, bearing in mind \r\nlessons learned, in order to improve the administration \r\nof the work of the General Assembly. \r\nWe reiterate our support for resolution 68/307, \r\nincluding the decision to establish, at the sixty-ninth \r\nsession, an ad hoc working group on the revitalization \r\nof the work of the Assembly. We congratulate the \r\nrepresentatives of Namibia and Croatia on their \r\nappointments to as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\ncurrent international situation is undergoing profound \r\nchanges. All manner of new threats and challenges \r\ncontinue to emerge one after another. Interlinked \r\nsecurity issues, traditional and non-traditional, require \r\njoint responses from the international community. The \r\ninternational community expects the United Nations to \r\nplay a more important role in safeguarding global peace, \r\npromoting multilateral development and advancing \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nThe General Assembly, with its 193 members, is \r\nthe most universal and representative organ under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, as well as the chief \r\npolicymaking and deliberative organ. Member States in \r\ngeneral, and the developing countries in particular, hope \r\n24/25 14-63492\r\nA/69/PV.55 18/11/2014\r\nthat the Assembly will continue to improve its work, \r\nenhance its role and authority, and fully implement its \r\nCharter-mandated functions.\r\nThe General Assembly should focus more on its \r\npolicy-deliberation function and promote the vigorous \r\nparticipation of Member States in its work. It should \r\nalso set its priorities in the light of current developments \r\nin the international situation and concentrate on major \r\nissues touching on the interests of Member States, \r\nespecially development, which is a common concern \r\nof the developing countries. At this session the \r\nAssembly should focus on prioritizing and increasing \r\ninvestment in development and play an important role \r\nin formulating the post-2015 development agenda and \r\npromoting sustainable development.\r\nAs principal organs of the United Nations, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council should improve their \r\ncoordination and division of labour and continue \r\nto exploit the comparative advantages in their \r\nrespective fields, while enhancing interaction and \r\ninformation-exchange and forming synergies. In the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, the \r\nGeneral Assembly should enhance coordination and \r\ncooperation with the Security Council in accordance \r\nwith the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nChina takes note of the results achieved by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in improving its working methods \r\nin the election of the non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council and the members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council. We will continue to support the \r\nAssembly’s efforts to improve its working methods, to \r\nrationalize its decision-making process, strengthen its \r\nefficiency and build a pragmatic and action-oriented \r\nculture.\r\nThe efficient functioning of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly is important in \r\nguaranteeing the success of the Assembly’s. efforts \r\nChina favours enhancing support for the Office of \r\nthe  President in terms of the budget and human \r\nresources, particularly in connection with resolving the \r\ndifficulties encountered by developing countries when \r\nthey assume the presidency of the General Assembly. \r\nIn recent years, China has contributed to the trust fund \r\nto support of the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. We hope that all parties will take concrete \r\nmeasures to support that Office.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly \r\ninvolves the interests of all Member States. China \r\nfirmly supports revitalizing the Assembly and the \r\nPresident’s efforts in that regard. China congratulates \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia \r\non their assumption of the co-chairmanship of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly at this session. It is our hope \r\nthat, in the framework of the Ad Hoc Working Group, \r\nall parties will pursue the principles of democratic \r\nconsultations and incremental progress and will \r\naddress the easier issues first, while steadily pushing \r\nfor the implementation of Assembly resolutions on \r\nrevitalization.\r\nThe membership as a whole maintains high \r\nexpectations regarding revitalization. We stand ready \r\nto work with other Member States in jointly seeking \r\nprogress at this session on the important item of the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Adamov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Algeria \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM). \r\nWe take this opportunity to express our gratitude to \r\nAlgeria for its consistent and systematic formulation \r\nand advancement of the NAM position in the work of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly.\r\nWe also express our sincere appreciation for the \r\norganization of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nby the representatives and experts of the delegations of \r\nSlovakia and Thailand. Our delegation is prepared to \r\nwork actively and constructively under the chairmanship \r\nof the representatives of Croatia and Namibia.\r\nThe Belarusian delegation welcomes the opportunity \r\nprovided by the adoption of the relevant resolution \r\n(resolution 68/307) to draw Member States’ attention \r\nto the procedure for selecting the Secretary-General, in \r\naccordance with the rules of procedure of the General \r\nAssembly. The Belarusian delegation considers it \r\nimportant that, for the first time in over 40 years, \r\nevery State, large and small, will be able to express its \r\nopinion regarding the next selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral by means of a genuinely secret ballot in the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOur delegation also welcomes the request contained \r\nin the resolution for an appropriate gender balance \r\nin a number of the Organization’s duty posts. We \r\nsincerely regret the fact that during the 70 years of the \r\nOrganization’s history, that principle has not affected \r\n14-63492 25/25\r\n18/11/2014 A/69/PV.55\r\nthe main administrative post of the Organization. We \r\ntherefore believe it highly important, overdue and timely \r\nto elect a woman to the post of Secretary-General. \r\nThe Belarusian delegation also welcomes the \r\nimplementation of a predictable mechanism for rotating \r\nthe chairmanships of the Main Committees, which will \r\nbe put into practice at this session. We look forward to \r\nfurther productive work in that area, as called for in the \r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver a joint statement on behalf of Namibia and \r\nCroatia.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for appointing my colleague, the \r\nAmbassador of Namibia, and me as co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly. We feel deeply honoured and \r\nprivileged to be given the opportunity to participate in \r\nsuch a vital and far-reaching process.\r\nWe have taken careful note of today’s debate and \r\nwill take everything that has been said as guidelines \r\nin our future work. In our efforts, we are not starting \r\nfrom scratch; on the contrary, significant work has \r\nbeen done so far, including the adoption of resolution \r\n68/307 on 10 September, and we take this opportunity \r\nto highly commend our predecessors and dear friends, \r\nAmbassadors Ružička of Slovakia and Sinhaseni of \r\nThailand, for their personal commitment and leadership \r\nin that regard. We stand at the disposal of the Member \r\nStates for consultations, exchange of views and the \r\nexploration new ideas in the months to come.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that we are looking \r\nforward to working with all Members and express our \r\nthanks, once again, for the privilege and opportunity \r\nof facilitating the General Assembly’s revitalization \r\nprocess.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on these agenda items.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 117 and 118.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
