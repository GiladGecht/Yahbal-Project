"*1464058*\r\n14-64058 (E)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 11.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 64\r\nHigh-level meeting on the occasion of the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child\r\nPromotion and protection of the rights of children\r\n(a) Promotion and protection of the rights of children\r\nThe President: We meet today to commemorate \r\nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child. That landmark \r\ndocument is the cornerstone for the promotion and \r\nprotection of children’s rights worldwide. It ref lects our \r\ncollective commitment to ensuring that every child in \r\nevery society has the right to a fair start in life. Over \r\nthe past 25 years, the Convention has created new \r\nperspectives on the place and role of children in society, \r\nwhile serving as the basis for important legislation. \r\nIndeed, its provisions not only ensure special care and \r\nassistance for children, they also encourage their full \r\nparticipation in their communities and in all decisions \r\naffecting them.\r\nIn 2002, the General Assembly held a special session \r\non children to review progress since the World Summit \r\nfor Children, which had given a new impetus to global \r\ncommitments on children’s rights. That was the very \r\nfirst time that children participated in a United Nations \r\nconference as delegates. Addressing the Assembly, \r\nchildren described their visions of a world fit for them, \r\na world where their fundamental rights are respected, \r\na world without exploitation, abuse, violence, war or \r\npoverty. They spoke of a world with access to health \r\ncare and education and a thriving environment. As we \r\nlook back today, we must ponder the question of how \r\nfar we have come in making that vision a reality.\r\nWe should feel encouraged by the significant \r\nimprovement in the living conditions of children \r\naround the world. The Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) have focused national and international efforts, \r\nwhile also generating resources to support a number \r\nof key initiatives related to children. For example, \r\nmortality rates for children under 5 have been cut in \r\nhalf, partly thanks to immunization campaigns and \r\nimproved access to clean water and sanitation. More \r\nchildren than ever before attend school, with about \r\n9 in 10 children in developing countries now enrolled in \r\nprimary education. Extreme poverty and hunger have \r\nalso decreased.\r\nYet significant disparities remain. Children born \r\ninto poor families, living in conflict or post-conflict \r\ncountries or growing up in marginalized communities \r\ndo not have the same opportunities to realize their full \r\npotential. In many countries around the world, girls \r\nstill have limited access to education and are at risk of \r\nearly and forced marriage. Child malnutrition remains \r\na serious issue, as do child labour, child trafficking \r\nand child prostitution. We must continue investing in \r\nthe rights of all children across the world, regardless \r\nof their gender, ethnicity, race, disability or economic \r\nstatus. Children are the fundamental building blocks \r\nof the future we want. Indeed, by strengthening their \r\ncapacity to mature into engaged, responsible and \r\nproductive adults, society as a whole stands to benefit. \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.56\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n56th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 20 November 2014, 11 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

With targets for \r\nreducing inequality, ending violence against children \r\nand combating child poverty, the proposals of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals provide a solid base from which to move \r\nforward. It will also be critical to maintain a holistic \r\napproach and address other factors that can undermine \r\ndevelopment gains, such as poverty, violence, conflict, \r\nweak governance and the absence of the rule of law. \r\nEqually important is the need to ensure mobilization \r\nof the resources that will be required to implement a \r\ntruly transformative development agenda that puts \r\nthe welfare of all people, especially children, at the \r\nforefront.\r\nIn that regard, investing in children and young \r\npeople should be central to discussions on financing \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. At the global \r\nlevel, that should translate into new and innovative \r\npartnerships between Governments, the private sector, \r\ncivil society and financial institutions. Firm domestic- \r\nresource commitments for children will also be crucial \r\nas economies grow and demands for social intervention \r\nbecome more diversified. Governments must ensure \r\nthat the benefits of growth are shared equally and \r\nequitably across groups and generations, focusing in \r\nparticular on the needs of the most vulnerable.\r\nTwenty-five years after the adoption of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, we must ask \r\nourselves if the world is a better place for the child. This \r\nafternoon’s interactive panel discussion will provide \r\nan opportunity to further explore that question. As we \r\nreflect on how the next 25 years can result in further \r\npromoting the universal realization of children’s rights, \r\nlet me conclude with these inspirational words from \r\nthe children who addressed the special session of the \r\nAssembly in 2002: “We want a world fit for children, \r\nbecause a world fit for us is a world fit for everyone” \r\n(A/S-27/PV.1, p. 8).\r\nWe shall now hear statements in accordance with \r\nparagraph 2 of resolution 68/273.\r\nI give the f loor to the Executive Director of the \r\nUnited Nations Children’s Fund.\r\nMr. Lake (United Nations Children’s Fund): I am \r\ntruly honoured to speak on such a wonderful occasion \r\nas this, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child, and even more honoured \r\nto be doing so on behalf of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, who could not be here today because he has \r\nimportant meetings in Washington that he could not \r\nget away from. I have often seen how committed he is \r\nto the human rights of all people, including, of course, \r\nchildren. I would also like to sincerely thank you, \r\nMr. President, not only for your excellent remarks just \r\nnow but for your support for the wonderful event held \r\nthis morning in the General Assembly Hall, as well as \r\nfor your support for children and children’s rights. All \r\nof this could not have taken place without your help \r\nand support. And let me add my own warm welcome \r\nto Teyise Dlamini, who is here and has travelled all the \r\nway from Swaziland to speak on behalf of all children \r\nand young people. I will be brief so that we can get to \r\nMs. Dlamini all the sooner.\r\nLet me start with an irreverent question. What \r\ndo Dr. Seuss, the beloved author of children’s books, \r\nand the Convention on the Rights of the Child have in \r\ncommon? The answer is that they both believe that, \r\nas Dr. Seuss wrote, “A person’s a person, no matter \r\nhow small”. That is likely the first time that Dr. Seuss \r\nhas been quoted in the General Assembly Hall; I also \r\nbelieve that it will almost certainly be the last. But his \r\nwords are fitting today as we celebrate the Convention’s \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary. Why? Because the health, \r\nsoul and intelligence of a society are measured by how \r\nthe human rights of its youngest and smallest citizens \r\nare recognized and acted on everywhere. That is why \r\nthe Convention, the most rapidly and widely ratified \r\nhuman rights treaty in history, was such an important \r\nmilestone. For the first time, it articulated the principle \r\nthat regardless of gender, ethnicity, economic status, \r\nreligious belief or disability, all children, everywhere, \r\npossess innate rights, no less than adults — rights to \r\nhealth, education, protection and participation, for all.\r\nBut a recognized right is not necessarily an \r\nexecuted right. Children’s rights are brought to life not \r\nsimply through pronouncements but through policies \r\nand persistent commitment. A society’s strength is \r\nsecured not merely through good intentions but through \r\nstrategic investments. And positive change is achieved \r\nnot only through powerful words but through practical \r\nactions. For without action, without results, the rights \r\nenshrined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child \r\namount to little more than words on a piece of paper.\r\nFor the past 25 years, Governments, communities, \r\nnon-governmental organizations, United Nations \r\n14-64058 3/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nagencies, businesses and, especially, children themselves \r\nhave together translated rights into results. Millions \r\nmore children are surviving beyond their fifth \r\nbirthdays, receiving vaccinations against preventable \r\ndiseases such as polio, and enjoying improved access \r\nto education, sanitation, water, nutrition and protection \r\nfrom all manner of abuses.\r\nBut for millions of children, life is not better. Life \r\nis not better for some 17,000 children under 5 who \r\nwill die today, mostly because of causes that we can \r\nprevent. Life is not better for the 250 million primary-\r\nschool-age children who cannot read, write or do their \r\nnumbers, even though more than half of them have \r\nspent at least four years in school. Life is not better for \r\naround 120 million girls under the age of 20, or about \r\none in 10, who have been subjected to sexual violence \r\nat some point in their lives. Think of it — one in every \r\n10. And life is not better for the nearly 570 million \r\nchildren living in extreme poverty, their needs unmet \r\nand deprived of their dignity and their rights.\r\nOn this day of celebration, we must also ask \r\nourselves some hard questions. How could we let this \r\nhappen? How could we achieve progress for some, \r\nyet continue to fail so many? How could we so betray \r\nthe promise of the Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild — betray the children most denied the rights that \r\nthe Convention enshrines? Part of the answer, I think, \r\nis this — too often, we have measured progress through \r\nnational statistical averages. But averages are exactly \r\nthat — averages. Averages do not capture every life. \r\nAverages do not see the children being left behind. \r\nThe girl kept at home instead of being allowed to go \r\nto school. The boy languishing in an institution just \r\nbecause he lives with a disability. The children recruited \r\nand brutalized by militias, made to fight for causes they \r\ncan barely understand, seeing the worst of humanity, \r\nand then being forced to inflict that on others.\r\nAnd in today’s turbulent times, the threat to children \r\nincreases. Syrian children are made to f lee far from their \r\nhomes, making the difficult, dangerous, heartbreaking \r\njourney to a refugee camp. They are not only caught \r\nin the cross-fire of brutal, protracted conflicts, but \r\nsee their schools deliberately, outrageously used and \r\ntargeted for military purposes. The children watching \r\nfriends, relatives and heroic aid workers fall to the \r\nscourge of Ebola, wondering who will be next. Little \r\nwonder that the Secretary-General reflected recently \r\nthat it seems “as if the world is falling apart”.\r\nBut while the humanitarian community may now \r\nbe losing ground to those escalating emergencies, we \r\nare not losing heart, because the difference between \r\nreaching, say, 80 per cent of all we need to do and 90 per \r\ncent of our humanitarian goals is not just a statistical \r\n10 per cent. That 10 per cent represents tens or hundreds \r\nor thousands of lives. That 10 per cent represents \r\nmore children being fed, protected, immunized and \r\neducated — an inch more solid ground from which a \r\nstronger root of development can take hold. The ground \r\nwe do gain — each child’s rights we protect, each \r\nchild’s life we save or improve — is a success that must \r\nstill be recognized and even celebrated. Such small \r\nbut significant individual wins will continue to be our \r\nprimary concern. Because meeting the needs of a child \r\nis never a small thing. It is, in fact, everything to that \r\nchild, her family and community, and thus to her country. \r\nAnd ultimately, to all of us, because, when we invest \r\nin children’s health, nutrition, education, participation \r\nand protection, we invest in all of our futures — in the \r\nteachers, doctors, innovators and environmentalists of \r\ntomorrow, in the next generation of parents and leaders, \r\nwho will then guide future generations.\r\nIn doing so, we are not only preparing their \r\nminds and bodies — we are building their hearts, \r\nwe are building their spirits. It is our job, our \r\nresponsibility, our obligation under the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child to show every child the best of \r\nhumanity — cooperation, not conflict; humanity, not \r\nhatred; reconciliation, not revenge. Children who grow \r\nup seeing those qualities around them will be more \r\nlikely to replicate them in their own lives, more likely \r\nto extend them to their own children and their fellow \r\ncitizens, and more able, and more willing, to shape the \r\nworld that we leave them. And that in the end is the \r\ncentral message and meaning of the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child: the importance of preparing today’s \r\nchildren to become tomorrow’s adults, tomorrow’s \r\nleaders, and to do so by extending the Convention’s \r\npromise to those millions of children now being left \r\nbehind.\r\nAs we imagine a better future, let us imagine the \r\nmoment in 2039 when today’s children celebrate the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child. They will celebrate not only promises made \r\nbut promises kept. They will celebrate results, ref lected \r\nin the lives of their own children — children who also \r\nare prepared to meet their responsibility to build a \r\nbetter world.\r\n4/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nThe President: I thank the Executive Director of \r\nthe United Nations Children’s Fund for his statement.\r\nMembers will recall that in its resolution 68/273 the \r\nGeneral Assembly decided that the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights would participate in \r\nhigh-level meetings. I understand that Mr. Zeid Ra’ad \r\nAl Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, is unable to join us today, owing to \r\nother pressing business. I should now like to consult \r\nmembers with a view to giving the f loor to Mr. Ivan \r\nŠimonović, Assistant Secretary-General for Human \r\nRights.\r\nIf there is no objection, may I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly, and without setting a \r\nprecedent, to invite Mr. Ivan Šimonović, Assistant-\r\nSecretary-General for Human Rights, to make a \r\nstatement at this meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nIn accordance with the decision just taken, I now \r\ngive the f loor to the Assistant Secretary-General for \r\nHuman Rights.\r\nMr. Šimonović (Assistant Secretary-General for \r\nHuman Rights): Since the adoption of the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child 25 years ago, we should ask \r\nourselves: is the world a safer place for children? Are \r\nchildren more empowered than they were in 1989? \r\nDo they enjoy better health and well-being? There \r\nare reasons for concern. Children caught up in armed \r\nconflicts continue to be injured and killed, and we \r\nsee children themselves injuring and killing others. \r\nChildren are kidnapped in their schools, drowned at \r\nsea while trying to f lee conflict or poverty, exploited \r\nthrough child labour, induced via the Internet to join \r\narmed groups, or they fall victim to paedophile rings. \r\nYoung girls are forced into marriage or not allowed to go \r\nto school, or they become victims of harmful practices. \r\nChildren are also bullied and cyberbullied because of \r\ntheir disability, ethnic origin, sexual orientation or \r\nother perceived difference. Some then take their own \r\nlives. Girls starve themselves to conform to ideas of \r\nbeauty. The picture of modern childhood looks grim.\r\nHowever, at the same time we also have good news \r\nto celebrate. In aggregate terms, children today have \r\naccess to a better standard of life, more education and \r\na higher level of health than ever before in the history \r\nof the world. In most countries they are not allowed to \r\ngo to work at an early age. Thanks to digital media, \r\naccessed through new information and communication \r\ntechnologies, children have vastly greater opportunities \r\nto learn, participate, play, work and socialize. We have \r\nexplored only a fraction of the opportunities that this \r\ntechnology presents for empowering children. That \r\ntechnology is also facilitating a child’s right to be heard \r\nand children’s participation in decisions affecting them. \r\nChildren are finding their voice, and the legitimacy of \r\ntheir voice is now widely recognized.\r\nFrom standing up for their rights to education to \r\nseeking governance reform in their communities, we see \r\nan increasing number of children not only expressing \r\ntheir views but taking the lead in social movements. I \r\nalso think that it is fair to say that, in 2014, if violations \r\noccur, children have far greater possibilities for gaining \r\naccess to various complaints mechanisms and for \r\nseeking redress than they did 25 years ago.\r\nMany of those positive developments are fragile, \r\nand, certainly, great inequalities among States and \r\nwithin States persist. There remains much to be \r\ndone. An example is States’ obligations under article \r\n24 of the Convention to eliminate preventable child \r\ndeaths. Efforts over the past 25 years have resulted in \r\na staggering 17,000 fewer child deaths each day. The \r\nchallenges remain, however: some 6.3 million children \r\nunder 5 years of age died in 2013. With the knowledge \r\nand technology available today, that is inexcusable.\r\nDeep inequalities and pervasive discrimination \r\nlie at the root of most of those deaths. We must stop \r\nconsidering child mortality to be an inevitable fact of \r\nlife. To that end, the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights and the World Health \r\nOrganization recently released technical guidance on \r\na human-rights-based approach to preventing child \r\nmortality grounded in the principles of the Convention. \r\nThe guidance, which was launched two months ago \r\nin Geneva, lists tangible, concrete measures that \r\nStates can take, using a human-rights-based approach, \r\nto reduce and eliminate preventable mortality and \r\nmorbidity of children under the age of 5. The existence \r\nof the Convention on the Rights of the Child and its \r\nglobally agreed position that children have rights has \r\nlaid the foundation for such improvements in children’s \r\nlives in the past quarter-century.\r\nAfter looking back at the 25 years of the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child, we are compelled to look to \r\nthe future. Now is the time to recommit to the vision \r\nof the Convention and to its full implementation. It is \r\n14-64058 5/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nalso the time to bring children and their rights more \r\ncentrally into our peace and security and development \r\nthinking and action, notably in the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. Our future in those areas depends \r\non our children and our respect for their rights.\r\nWhile much has been done globally to achieve \r\na rights-based vision of childhood — which is an \r\nachievement on the part of Member States — the role \r\nof the Committee on the Rights of the Child must \r\nbe recognized as a driving force through its regular \r\npublic consideration of State’s efforts to implement the \r\nConvention and the gradual elaboration of the concrete \r\nmeaning of children’s rights in practice. For instance, \r\nthe Committee asks all States what they are doing to \r\nensure the coordination of policies relating to children \r\nwithin and across all levels of Government. Do they \r\nhave a national monitoring mechanism specific to \r\nchildren’s rights, like a children’s ombudsperson? Is \r\nthere a specific national budget for children? Are all \r\ndecisions relating to a child based on the best interests \r\nof that particular child, rather than on the interests of \r\nthe family, community or State?\r\nSuch questions posed in 1989 may have been met \r\nin many quarters with bewilderment. Today they are \r\naccepted and acted upon as a normal part of efforts to \r\nrender greater fulfilment of children’s rights. Let us \r\ncontinue to fight for that noble goal.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Children \r\nand Armed Conflict.\r\nMs. Zerrougui (Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict): \r\nAs we have come here today to celebrate the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child, it is important to look back, as \r\nmy colleague did, and highlight the long way that we \r\nhave gone together to improve the protection of children. \r\nBy ratifying the Convention, some 194 countries in the \r\nworld have recognized that children, boys and girls, \r\nhave rights and that Governments bear the primary \r\nresponsibility for the respect for and protection and \r\nfulfilment of those rights.\r\nAs the most ratified human rights treaty in the \r\nworld, the Convention has resulted in a significant \r\ninternational consensus that the protection and \r\npromotion of the rights of the child are a moral, social \r\nand legal imperative for all of us. It is particularly \r\nencouraging to see that the Convention has inspired \r\na number of positive changes in law and policy \r\naimed at improving the lives of children by framing \r\nchildren’s basic needs, such as education and health, as \r\ninalienable rights, not as a privilege that only a few can \r\nenjoy. The enhanced protection of children’s rights has \r\nalso resulted in tangible improvements for children’s \r\ndevelopment, ranging from a reduction in infant and \r\nchild mortality to an increase in school enrolment.\r\nHowever, the progress achieved over the past 25 \r\nyears remains uneven. In conflict situations, children \r\ncontinue to be killed, maimed, recruited and used \r\nby armed forces and groups, and deprived of health \r\ncare and education. Children continue to be the most \r\nvulnerable to the impact of armed conflict in various \r\nparts of the world. In my travels to conflict zones, I \r\nhave met too many children forced to abandon their \r\nhomes, in some cases without their families. Recently, \r\nI met a child who, at the beginning of the conflict in \r\nSouth Sudan, happened to be at the wrong place at \r\nthe wrong time. He is now recovering from gunshot \r\nwounds and is struggling to walk again. Seven months \r\nafter he was injured, he still did not know where his \r\nfamily was, but had been lucky enough to be brought \r\nto a centre supported by the United Nations to receive \r\ntreatment. That is, unfortunately, not always the case \r\nfor every child.\r\nIn May 2015, we will mark the fifteenth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child, which deals \r\nwith the involvement of children in armed conflict. \r\nThe Protocol offers a solid basis for building legal, \r\npolicy and operational frameworks at both the national \r\nand the international levels. Under the Protocol, States \r\nare required to ban compulsory recruitment below the \r\nage of 18 and to ensure that any individual in their \r\narmed forces under the age of 18 does not take part in \r\nhostilities. States parties shall also take all necessary \r\nmeasures to prohibit and prevent the recruitment and \r\nuse of children under the age of 18 by non-State armed \r\ngroups. To date, 158 Member States have ratified \r\nthe Optional Protocol, and I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to call on those that have not yet done so to \r\ntake steps towards ratification.\r\nAs part of my mandate, I continuously advocate for \r\nthe protection of children in conflict, with Governments \r\nas well as with armed groups. To that end, I engage \r\nwith parties to conflict and all relevant stakeholders \r\nto end violations, including the recruitment and use \r\nof children in armed conflict. And there is progress to \r\n6/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nreport. Years of engagement with parties to conflict to \r\nend the recruitment and use of children are starting to \r\nyield results. Twenty-five years after the adoption of \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child, and, as I \r\nsaid, nearly 15 years after the adoption of the Optional \r\nProtocol on the involvement of children in armed \r\nconflict, we can now say that there is an emerging \r\nconsensus among the world’s Governments that \r\nchildren do not belong in national forces in conflict.\r\nBuilding on that consensus, I launched the \r\n“Children, Not Soldiers” campaign, jointly with \r\nUNICEF, to end the recruitment and use of children \r\nby Government armed forces by 2016. I hope that we \r\nwill achieve that result with the support of everyone. \r\nIn the eight months since we launched the campaign, \r\nthere has been significant progress. The Government \r\nof Yemen signed an action plan with the United Nations \r\ncommitting itself to making their national security \r\nforces child-free. Chad completed all the requirements \r\nunder its action plan and was delisted. The Government \r\nof South Sudan formally recommitted to its action \r\nplan to end the recruitment and use of children, while \r\nin Somalia the Cabinet adopted the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child, which is awaiting ratification \r\nby the country’s parliament. The Government of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Congo has made progress in \r\nthe implementation of the action plan and has appointed \r\na presidential adviser for sexual violence and child \r\nrecruitment. In Afghanistan, a road map was developed \r\nto accelerate the implementation of the action plan.\r\nI am naturally encouraged by that progress and by \r\nthe momentum created by the campaign, but there is still \r\na lot of work ahead of us. All concerned Governments \r\nand regional and non-governmental organizations must \r\ncontinue to work hand in hand with the United Nations, \r\nbilateral partners and donors, if we want to reach the \r\nobjectives of the campaign. Ending child recruitment \r\nby Government forces in the next two years is possible, \r\nbut only if we work together and share our expertise \r\nand resources.\r\nAlthough the Convention on the Rights of the Child \r\nhas contributed to greater advocacy and awareness \r\nof child rights worldwide, our mission is far from \r\ncomplete. Governments’ compliance with and full \r\nintegration of the Convention into national systems still \r\npresent challenges. The monitoring and reporting of \r\nthe six grave violations against children during armed \r\nconflict has proved to be an important tool informing \r\nthe work of the Committee on the Rights of the Child \r\nin monitoring Governments’ obligations outlined in the \r\nConvention.\r\nOne of the gaps that remains of great concern is \r\nensuring individual accountability for violations of \r\nchildren’s rights during armed conflict. I am encouraged \r\nby the recent entry into force of the third Optional \r\nProtocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child \r\nin April, allowing the establishment of an international \r\ncomplaints procedure for violations of children’s rights, \r\nas specified in the Convention and Protocols. That is \r\na step in the right direction to promote child victims’ \r\nrights and ensure better access to justice.\r\nSince the onset of my tenure, I have made the \r\nprotection of education and health care a priority, as \r\neach day we witness an alarming number of attacks \r\non schools, social infrastructure and hospitals, and on \r\nstudents, teachers and medical personnel. When I met \r\nfamilies from Syria who had left everything behind \r\nto f lee the conflict, the one thing parents said they \r\nreally wanted was a school that their children could \r\ngo to. They knew that every month that went by with \r\ntheir children out of school would be very difficult to \r\nmake up for. The parents I met knew that nothing could \r\nreplace the comfort of going to school every day, even \r\nin the midst of chaos, and they wanted to make sure that \r\ntheir children would not miss out on the chance to build \r\na brighter future for themselves and their country.\r\nIt is time to turn aspirations into practice in all parts \r\nof the globe and put an end to the suffering of children. \r\nI count on Member States to honour the commitments \r\nthat they have made by ratifying the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocols and \r\nby endorsing the “Children, Not Soldiers” campaign. \r\nI will continue to take all possible opportunities to \r\nadvocate for stronger child-protection frameworks, and \r\nI encourage all Member States to support initiatives \r\nthat are being undertaken to respond to the challenges \r\nposed to child protection in conflict situations.\r\nWe shall pursue our efforts to recognize and address \r\nthe shortcomings and challenges that we face in keeping \r\nchildren safe from the harm of conflict by ensuring that \r\nwe use the tools developed over the past 25 years to \r\nprotect children to their fullest. Building consensus on \r\nthe urgency and importance of our collective action to \r\nprotect children is critical.\r\nI would like, in closing, to commend the work, \r\ndedication and tireless efforts of the child-protection \r\nactors, in particular, those who are working in complex \r\n14-64058 7/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nsecurity environments. Child victims count on all of us \r\nto stand together to respect, protect and promote their \r\nrights. We cannot fail to honour the promise we made \r\nto them 25 years ago.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on Violence \r\nagainst Children.\r\nMs. Santos Pais (Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General on Violence against Children): It \r\nis with deep emotion that I am participating in this \r\nimportant commemorative session. I was here, in \r\nthis very Hall of the General Assembly, 25 years ago, \r\nwitnessing the formal adoption of the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child. It was a moment of immense \r\njoy, in which we celebrated the ground-breaking \r\nresult of a long negotiation process, in which I had the \r\nprivilege to participate. I also recall how we had been \r\ninfluenced by the spirit of the great Polish paediatrician \r\nJanusz Korczak, encouraging us to place children first \r\nand above all legal, political, social and economic \r\ndifferences, and recognizing that children are citizens \r\nof today and true agents of change. The Convention \r\nreflects that important vision and entrusts us with a \r\ncompelling mission — to spare no effort to translate \r\nits provisions into a tangible reality for all children, \r\neverywhere, at all times.\r\nI have the honour to address the Assembly 25 years \r\nlater and to reflect on whether the world we imagined \r\nthen has become a reality. My mandate exposes me \r\nto the worst and to the best of humankind. The worst \r\nis certainly represented by the countless children \r\nexposed to violence, often in a pervasive, hidden \r\nand concealed manner. We see children intentionally \r\ntargeted in politically driven processes, manipulated in \r\norganized crime, sold and exploited for economic gains, \r\ndisciplined through violent means, sexually abused in \r\nthe privacy of their homes, neglected in institutions, \r\nbullied in schools, stigmatized and ill-treated as a \r\nresult of superstition or harmful practices. Every five \r\nminutes, a child dies as a result of violence.\r\nChildren’s pervasive exposure to violence is well \r\ndocumented by United Nations reports, academic \r\nevidence and children’s heartbreaking stories, which \r\nall convey a pressing sense of urgency. For millions of \r\nchildren around the world, life is defined by two words: \r\nfear and pain. For them, the world has no safe havens, \r\nand nations are missing the chance to build a better \r\nworld for all. The Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild recognizes the right of the child to freedom from \r\nviolence. Yet only 10 per cent of the world’s children \r\nare protected by national legislation prohibiting all \r\nforms of violence, including within the home.\r\nViolence compromises all children’s rights. It \r\ngoes hand in hand with deprivation, high risks of poor \r\nhealth, poor school performance and long-term welfare \r\ndependency. In early childhood, the impact of violence \r\nis often irreversible. As children grow, the cumulative \r\nexposure to manifestations of violence becomes a \r\ncontinuum spreading across their life cycle and at \r\ntimes persisting across generations. Beyond the impact \r\non individual victims and their families, violence is \r\nassociated with far-reaching costs for society. It diverts \r\nbillions of dollars from social spending, slowing \r\neconomic development and eroding nations’ human and \r\nsocial capital.\r\nCan we then say that the world is a better place for \r\nchildren? Since 1989, the world has made tremendous \r\nstrides towards the realization of children’s rights. The \r\nConvention has triggered decisive improvements in \r\nnational laws, in the establishment of institutions for the \r\nprotection of children’s rights and in the development \r\nof child-centred policies and child-friendly services. \r\nThe voice of children is being given greater importance \r\nand is having an influence on policy-making. Thanks \r\nto the Convention, we have better trained professionals, \r\nwe have seen the emergence of sound evidence on \r\nmatters affecting children, and we see a positive change \r\nin behaviours and attitudes towards children. Progress \r\nacross countries shows that violence is not inevitable \r\nand can indeed be prevented and eliminated.\r\nThanks to those efforts, children are safer, healthier, \r\nbetter educated and more empowered. But that better \r\nworld is not good enough. The ambition of children is to \r\nhelp build a world as big as their dreams. If we want to \r\nfulfil that aspiration, we need to accelerate our efforts \r\nand make sure that the ethos of the Convention inspires \r\nthe way in which we all design the world. And the best \r\nway to succeed is to have children at the drawing table.\r\nMy mandate also exposes me to the very best of \r\nhumankind. And the best comes, not surprisingly, \r\nfrom children themselves. Time and again, I meet child \r\nvictims emerging from the worst of nightmares, yet \r\nresilient, confident, generous and showing us adults the \r\nway ahead. In all regions of the world, young advocates \r\njoin hands with national authorities, civil society \r\nand so many other allies to raise awareness about the \r\n8/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\ndetrimental impact of violence and to empower young \r\npeople to be the first line of protection against the risks \r\nof abuse and exploitation. Even in the most desperate \r\nsituations, children reveal hope for a better world and \r\ndetermination to achieve lasting change. That is much \r\nmore than just positive thinking; it is about positive \r\nachieving. In this year when we commemorate the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention, we have a \r\ngolden opportunity to place the Convention at centre \r\nstage and to promote a quantum leap in the protection \r\nof children from violence. Placing the elimination of \r\nviolence against children on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda can indeed bring that about.\r\nTo conclude, one thing is clear: the elimination \r\nof violence cannot be the dream of a few. It needs to \r\nbecome a cause for all. I remain fully committed to \r\nthat endeavour. Children’s rights are more than a set of \r\narticles. The vision of the Convention will not be fully \r\nrealized unless children’s rights become one of the \r\npillars that sustain society and are embraced as a core \r\nvalue for the dialogue between generations. A better \r\nworld for children is simply not enough. We need to aim \r\nfor its perfection.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nChairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the \r\nChild.\r\nMs. Sandberg (Committee on the Rights of the \r\nChild): It is an honour to be in the Hall today, in my \r\ncapacity as Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights \r\nof the Child, to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nNovember 1989 was historic in many ways, not \r\nleast because it was the first time that children were \r\nrecognized as rights-holders in an international treaty. \r\nIt marked a critical turning point in addressing serious \r\nhuman rights abuses against children, not simply with \r\nacts of charity but with advocacy for systemic change, \r\nbecause children had rights that were to be respected. \r\nThe Convention was the culmination of several decades \r\nof work to promote the rights of the child and the creation \r\nof a child-specific convention. Today, with 194 States \r\nparties, the Convention is the most widely ratified United \r\nNations human rights instrument. Its three Optional \r\nProtocols continue to draw support from States around \r\nthe world, steadily improving legal standards for the \r\nrespect, protection and fulfilment of children’s rights. \r\nThose four international legal instruments together \r\ncan claim over 530 ratifications — a clear sign of \r\ncommitment to ensuring that the rights of all children \r\nare respected. I would particularly like to congratulate \r\nStates that have ratified all four instruments, and I call \r\nupon all States to ratify the third Optional Protocol on \r\nthe communications procedure.\r\nToday, there is certainly cause for celebration. The \r\nConvention has improved the lives of children, to one \r\ndegree or another, in all States parties and beyond. \r\nMost States have been reviewed by the Committee at \r\nleast twice, and States are taking measures in line with \r\nthe Committee’s country-specific recommendation. \r\nHowever, there is still a lot to be done. In order to \r\nreinforce their commitment to children’s rights, I would \r\nlike to encourage States to implement the Committee’s \r\nrecommendations to an even greater extent. Creating \r\nthe future we want depends on how we act now. Right \r\nnow, the Convention and its Optional Protocols must \r\ncontinue to work to bring about real improvements in \r\nthe lives of children. For that, the participation of all \r\nactors in society, including children, is crucial.\r\nThe Committee has continually highlighted the \r\nimportance of child participation and has given it \r\nparticular attention this year as we mark the Convention’s \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary. On 24 September, as its main \r\nevent to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nConvention, the Committee hosted a direct online \r\ndialogue with 28 children from 14 countries around the \r\nworld. The right of children to participate is broader \r\nthan their right to be heard in matters affecting them. I \r\nam speaking about the right of all children to be active \r\nagents in the lives of communities at every level, whether \r\nin the family, in schools or in the broader community. \r\nTheir views may differ at times from those of adults, \r\nsimply because each generation experiences a world \r\ndifferent from that of those who preceded it. Children \r\nwill therefore, inevitably voice unique perspectives. We \r\ncannot afford to ignore their voices.\r\nFrom infancy, children learn to communicate \r\nby being communicated with, and they will learn to \r\ninteract with others based on how they are interacted \r\nwith. Making children feel that their ideas are immature \r\nor unrealistic leaves them feeling unwelcome and more \r\nlikely to disengage. Children are valuable members of \r\nour societies as children and must be engaged with, \r\naccording to their evolving capacities, throughout their \r\nchildhood and adolescence, if they are to contribute \r\npositively to their communities later when they are \r\nadults.\r\n14-64058 9/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nWhen children take part in discussions about \r\nprogrammes and policies relevant to children’s rights, \r\nand their ideas are listened to and developed, those \r\nprogrammes and policies are more likely to address the \r\nissues at hand. For example, at a past children’s meeting, \r\nthe Committee heard that the State under review had \r\nimplemented a transportation service to ensure that \r\nchildren with a disability could get to school. However, \r\nthe buses provided were bright yellow, which was in \r\nstark contrast to all the other school buses. They came to \r\nbe known as the “banana buses”. The children explained \r\nto the Committee that, while the transportation service \r\nwas an excellent initiative, it would have been better if \r\nall the buses were the same colour. While the intention \r\nhad been to ensure inclusion, the seemingly small issue \r\nof choosing a different colour for those buses had in \r\nfact reinforced the misconception that children with a \r\ndisability are somehow different.\r\nI reiterate that children have a unique perspective \r\nthat must be sought out and cannot be ignored. Twenty-\r\nfive years after the adoption of the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child, we still talk about “allowing” \r\nchildren to participate. However, just as we are \r\nshocked when an adult is silenced for expressing his \r\nor her views, we need to be concerned when children \r\nare silenced or kept out. They see the challenges that \r\ntheir communities face, and they are perfectly able to \r\nsuggest ideas, ideas that can, with the support of adults, \r\nbe developed into effective solutions.\r\nDuring the online discussion sessions that \r\nthe Committee hosted on 24 September, the child \r\nparticipants, aged between 11 and 17 years old, \r\ndemonstrated that when children receive appropriate \r\ninformation and are supported in forming their ideas \r\nand opinions, they can participate meaningfully. The \r\ninteraction with members of the Committee showed \r\nthat when adults and children communicate in a spirit of \r\nmutual respect, they can produce innovative solutions \r\nto the challenges that face our societies. The Committee \r\nwas thrilled to see and hear the children speaking \r\nopenly about the challenges that their communities \r\nface and, most importantly, how they thought those \r\nchallenges could be addressed.\r\nIn conclusion, it seems clear to me that as we go \r\nforward, we must ensure that the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child keeps pace with the young people \r\nfor whom it was designed. It must evolve with them and \r\nwith the generations to come in order to create both \r\na present and a future that honour the standards we \r\nthat agreed on and the goals that we set out to achieve \r\n25 years ago. In the design and implementation of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, not only must the \r\nvoices of children be heard, but their views and their \r\nrights must be reflected in the agenda. Children’s real \r\nparticipation will be possible only if information is \r\nmade available, if barriers are dismantled and if we \r\ncommit ourselves to adapting our ways of working so \r\nas to ensure accessibility. We need to create a culture of \r\nparticipation across all age brackets and ensure that our \r\nwork here matches the human rights situation on the \r\nground worldwide, both now and in the future.\r\nLet me end with a quote from Nelson Mandela: \r\n“There can be no keener revelation of a society’s soul \r\nthan the way in which it treats its children”.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Special \r\nRapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution \r\nand child pornography.\r\nMs. De Boer-Buquicchio (Special Rapporteur \r\non the sale of children, child prostitution and child \r\npornography): Twenty-five years ago, the United \r\nNations offered a wonderful gift to children around \r\nthe world — a treaty that recognized them as rights-\r\nholders. The message was loud and clear — children \r\nare not mini-human beings with mini-human rights. \r\nOne hundred and ninety-four countries followed suit by \r\nratifying the Convention on the Rights of the Child, with \r\na promise to respect, protect and empower children.\r\nSince then, many measures have contributed to \r\nkeeping that important promise alive. They include \r\nthe adoption of new laws, policies and action plans, \r\nthe provision of assistance and protection services, the \r\nestablishment of child-participation mechanisms, the \r\norganization of awareness-raising campaigns and the \r\ndevelopment of corporate social responsibility. Despite \r\nall those efforts, children, 25 years later, have many \r\nreasons to feel impatient and even angry. In 2014, there \r\nare still people who sell and buy children, who exploit \r\nthem and regard them as commodities. That is a blatant \r\ndenial of the human dignity of the child. Allowing \r\nthat to happen is a betrayal of children and seriously \r\ncompromises our chances to develop as a society.\r\nSeveral forms of the sale and sexual exploitation \r\nof children have worsened considerably since 1989. \r\nThe development of information and communications \r\ntechnology has made it much easier for criminals to \r\nproduce, share and store child-abuse material with full \r\nimpunity. Estimates indicate that the amount of child \r\n10/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nabuse material online runs into the millions of pages, \r\nand the number of individual children depicted is most \r\nlikely to be in the tens of thousands. The age of victims \r\nhas tended to decrease, and the representations are \r\nbecoming more graphic and violent.\r\nChild prostitution is still a prominent problem in \r\nmany countries. The root causes of child prostitution \r\nhave multiplied. They include early sexualization, the \r\ndissemination of sexualized images of children and \r\nviolence, and peer pressure. The so-called child sex \r\ntourism, a critical aspect of child prostitution, has also \r\nincreased, driven by the overall growth of tourism, the \r\nvirtual non-existence of prevention measures and the \r\ninadequate criminalization of offences. Children are \r\nalso being sold and forced into marriage.\r\nAlthough it has become less and less easy to \r\nillegally adopt a child, the demand for adoption has \r\ncontinued to increase. That creates the conditions for \r\na lucrative business that results in abuse, corruption \r\nand excessive fees, amounting to the sale of children. \r\nThe sale of organs is another abject form of business \r\nthat finds its victims among the most deprived and \r\nvulnerable of children.\r\nToday, more children are at risk of sale and sexual \r\nexploitation than was previously the case. On the one \r\nhand, children are increasingly vulnerable to sexual \r\nexploitation, as a result of poverty, the humanitarian \r\ncrisis, underdevelopment, inequality, social norms and \r\nbroken, dysfunctional families. On the other hand, \r\nthere is an increase in the demand for sex with children \r\nthat is coupled with the transnational dimension of the \r\nphenomenon.\r\nHence, coming back to the question, is the world a \r\nbetter place for children? I would say that it depends. \r\nFor the most vulnerable children, the truth is that the \r\nworld continues to be a labyrinth filled with traps \r\nand monsters, with few places to hide and nobody to \r\nturn to for help. In the particular case of the sale of \r\nchildren, child pornography and child prostitution, the \r\nsignificant efforts made through legislation, policies, \r\ncampaigns and international cooperation have not \r\nsucceeded in putting an end to those crimes. However, \r\nI have no doubt that, if respected and implemented, the \r\nprinciples and rights enshrined in the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child would completely change the \r\ntrend, benefiting the children who were left behind and \r\nsolving the pending problems. For that to happen, we \r\nneed political will, public awareness and concerted and \r\ncontinuous efforts.\r\nThe current negotiations around the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda offer an extraordinary opportunity \r\nto make a real breakthrough in the implementation of \r\nthe Convention on the Rights of the Child. Throughout \r\nthe process of implementing a human rights-based \r\napproach to the post-2015 development agenda, we \r\nhave to involve and empower children, as the best \r\npossible experts when it comes to determining their \r\nneeds and rights. Information and communication \r\ntechnologies (ICTs) offer manifold opportunities \r\nand tools for ensuring children’s participation and \r\nempowerment in the design and implementation of \r\nprevention and protection strategies. Children are \r\neager to use ICTs, and we should encourage them to \r\nexploit their creativity, their capacity to innovate and \r\ntheir willingness to communicate, turning ICTs into a \r\npowerful tool for the defence of children’s rights and \r\nthe expression of children’s agency.\r\nNext year, the Optional Protocol to the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child \r\nProstitution and Child Pornography will celebrate the \r\nfifteenth anniversary of its adoption, a good occasion to \r\ngo beyond rhetoric and take stock of the progress made \r\nsince 2000, reflect on ways to bridge implementation \r\ngaps and make a strong call in order to gather the \r\nnecessary effective support for making a reality of \r\nthe prevention and eradication of the sale and sexual \r\nexploitation of children.\r\nDespite the dark picture I have just painted, I still \r\nbelieve that we have at least 2.2 billion reasons to \r\ncelebrate — as many reasons as there are children in \r\nthe world. And we also have at least 5 billion additional \r\npeople who can be mobilized to make the world a better \r\nplace. When we blow out the 15 candles today, instead \r\nof making a wish, I would like to invite everyone \r\nhere to do something else. I would like them to take a \r\ndecision on what they are going to do next to make the \r\nworld a better place for children. And to remind them of \r\ntheir decision, I would like to close with a quote from a \r\nbeautiful poem by Robert Frost.\r\n“The woods are lovely, dark and deep,\r\nBut I have promises to keep,\r\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,\r\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.”\r\nThe President: I should now like to consult \r\nMembers with a view to giving the f loor to a child \r\nrepresentative. If there is no objection, and without \r\nsetting a precedent, may I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to invite a child representative, \r\n14-64058 11/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nMs. Teyise Dlamini of Swaziland, to deliver a statement \r\nat this meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\njust taken, I now give the f loor to child representative \r\nMs. Teyise Dlamini of Swaziland.\r\nMs. Dlamini (Swaziland): It is an honour to be \r\nhere in the Assembly to celebrate the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild. And it is indeed humbling to be the voice not \r\nonly of the kids of Swaziland, Africa and the world, but \r\nalso the voice of every young girl, everywhere. I feel \r\nvery proud and grateful for being invited.\r\nPeople may be wondering how a girl from \r\nMahamba, a small village in Swaziland, gets to grace \r\nsuch an important event as this. Two words — my \r\nmother. My mother is a single parent, and ever since I \r\nwas three, she has been both mother and father to my \r\nbrother and me. That has been a tough job, but she was \r\ndetermined that we would have a better life than she \r\ndid, because she gave birth at an early age and had to \r\nsacrifice a lot of fun things. Instead, she built her career \r\nso that she could provide us with a comfortable life. \r\nAt home, she taught both of us the importance of self-\r\nrespect, hard work, equal opportunity and studying at \r\nschool. She encouraged me to be courageous and to \r\nspeak up for what is right and what is wrong. Seeing \r\nmy mother struggle to give us everything we need is \r\nwhat motivates me to work hard every day. Today, I \r\nam strong, ambitious and confident because of the way \r\nmy mother raised me. And I will achieve my dream of \r\nbecoming a successful leader in society and changing \r\nthe lives of many children, especially young girls, \r\neverywhere.\r\nNot all children have received that upbringing. Not \r\nall girls will be able to realize their rights as I have been \r\nable to. Not all girls even know what their rights are. \r\nThat is why I wish that everybody could have a mother \r\nlike mine. So, every week, I host a youth-empowerment \r\nradio programme that discusses issues that affect all \r\nchildren and young people everywhere — issues such as \r\nliving with HIV, child marriage and violence between \r\nteachers and pupils. I try to tell my listeners that they \r\nhave the right not to be hit in their schools, not to be \r\nsexually assaulted and not to have to work when they \r\nshould be studying.\r\nToday, I have heard many leaders here speak about \r\nthe progress that has been made in the past 25 years. I \r\nam one of those children. I got my vaccinations. I go to \r\nschool and my school has toilets — but no soap. I have \r\nclean water to drink, and there is a clinic close by. I can \r\nspeak out and be heard about issues that affect me, even \r\nin the General Assembly. That is my story, but it is not \r\nthe story of all children. Every day, children’s rights \r\nin countries all over the world are violated at home, \r\nat school and in their social circles, and that applies \r\nespecially to children who live in war-torn societies.\r\nOne example is the right to education. In many \r\ncountries, it is still considered more important to send \r\nsons to school, and a waste of time and family resources \r\nto send female children. Does that not seem absurd? \r\nEspecially when we know that educated girls are \r\nmore likely to delay their first sexual encounter, delay \r\nmarriage and earn a higher salary later in life. Or take \r\nthe right of children with disabilities to go to school. \r\nThere is a girl I know in the village of Ngwenya, near \r\nwhere I live, who is deaf and blind. But the local school \r\nhas no facilities for her, so she cannot enrol. That is \r\nthe story for many children with disabilities around the \r\nworld. We need facilities in public schools everywhere, \r\nso that all children can learn together and play together, \r\nas we will all live together later in life. Only then will \r\nwe see every child’s talents unleashed.\r\nOr think about the right to protection from violence. \r\nEvery day in the media, we hear about child or sexual \r\nviolence. But in too many countries, people blame such \r\nthings on culture and social practices, so that often laws \r\nare not passed protecting children from such threats. \r\nToo often, that violence affects girls. Donors invest a \r\nlot in empowering the girl child against such violence, \r\nand that is good and important. But it is only one side of \r\nthe problem. Boys still grow up violent because they are \r\nnot taught how to respect women. They are not taught \r\nhow to respect us girls. Please, we need programmes to \r\nteach boys how to behave and how to respect us girls.\r\nMy message to all those here today is that they have \r\ndone well for some children, but they must do better \r\nfor all children — all of us. Millions are still crying for \r\nhelp, even 25 years after the adoption of the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child. As members look to the \r\nnext 25 years and plan our post-2015 world, they have \r\nin their hands the opportunity to enable us children to \r\nrealize our dreams in a peaceful and prosperous world. \r\nThe foundation of that world is safe, healthy, educated \r\nchildren — and empowered girls, registered at birth, \r\nenrolled in school, inspired by mentors and thriving in \r\nleadership roles. I hope that everyone here will start \r\n12/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nthis new era for children and youth by listening to us, \r\nnot just to older people’s versions of what they think \r\nwe want. Decisions that affect us children and young \r\npeople must start with discussions with children and \r\nyoung people.\r\nIn that vein, I ask representatives to please listen \r\ncarefully, because I am about to teach everyone some \r\nSiswati, the language of my country. I want those who \r\ntalk with their Governments about laws, policies and \r\nprogrammes for children and young people to remember \r\nthis, especially when someone says “Ah, but we cannot \r\nafford that”, then one could reply that one was taught \r\n“Bon haila, bon leiba, loya long bebe”. I ask everyone \r\nto say it along with me; I want it to sink into the heads \r\nof everyone present in the Assembly Hall. It means \r\n“Children are the future”. It is my way of asking the \r\nAssembly, in the spirit of the Convention on the Rights \r\nof the Child and on behalf of all children in Swaziland, \r\nAfrica and the world, to please protect us and invest in \r\nus today, tomorrow and always.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the representative \r\nof Mauritania, who will speak on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States.\r\nMr. Jiddou (Mauritania): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Group of African States on the occasion \r\nof the celebration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child.\r\nAs we gather today to celebrate this anniversary, it \r\nis an opportunity to give an overview of the progress \r\nmade in the implementation of commitments made \r\nwith regard to the protection and promotion of the \r\nrights of the child. The African Group believes that \r\nremarkable progress has been made for children in \r\nAfrican countries over the past decade, as illustrated \r\nby the marked decline in mortality for children under \r\nfive years of age, improved access to clean water and \r\nsanitation, and increased primary-school enrolment in \r\nall regions of the continent.\r\nHowever, profound challenges remain. The continent \r\nstill has the highest under-five mortality rates in the \r\nworld, with half of the world’s annual 6.6 million deaths \r\nin that age group being in Africa. Similarly, over half of \r\nthe world’s out-of-school children live in Africa. One in \r\nthree children under 5 years of age in Africa is stunted, \r\nand an estimated 3.1 million children under 15 years \r\nold are living with HIV. As Member States continue to \r\nshape the post-2015 development agenda, it is critical \r\nfor Africa’s children to remain a priority and benefit \r\nfrom increased attention and investments.\r\nTo address child protection in a sustainable \r\nmanner, the causes and symptoms of child abuse, \r\nneglect, exploitation and violence against children \r\nshould be addressed. Research shows that there is a \r\nstrong correlation between poverty and child abuse \r\nand exploitation. While we are commemorating and \r\nrecognizing the important changes that have taken \r\nplace in the realization of children’s rights, we applaud \r\nthe progress made but feel that a lot remains to be done \r\nto scale up progress in many African countries. African \r\nStates continue to face the challenges of poverty, \r\npolitical instability, economic and financial crises, \r\nclimate change and inadequate funding, which make it \r\ndifficult to provide the infrastructure services needed \r\nto cater to the needs of children, particularly children \r\nwith disabilities.\r\nIn armed-conflict situations, African children \r\nremain vulnerable as refugees or displaced persons. They \r\nwitness acts of violence, suffer from being orphaned \r\nand lose their education opportunities, even their lives, \r\nnot to speak of their chance to enjoy their livelihood \r\nand be part of a peaceful community. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the “Children, Not Soldiers” campaign of \r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General for \r\nChildren and Armed Conflicts, launched jointly with \r\nUNICEF in March, which seeks to end and prevent the \r\nrecruitment and use of children by Government armed \r\nforces by 2016. The African Group would like to seize \r\nthis opportunity to commend UNICEF for its work and \r\npledges to remain engaged to help that organization \r\ncarry out its mandate. UNICEF has a proven track record \r\nof leading the way in the promotion and protection of \r\nthe rights of the child, and Africa believes that UNICEF \r\nwill live up to its reputation in that regard in the coming \r\nyears. The African Group recognizes that resources are \r\nkey to achieving excellence in the delivery of results for \r\nchildren. UNICEF will never have enough resources to \r\nimplement comprehensive equity strategies around the \r\nworld.\r\nWe also welcome the partnership agreement signed \r\nbetween the Office of the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General and the African Union in September \r\n2013 and invite her to continue her work on strengthening \r\nthe child-protection system. We remain concerned about \r\nthe continued use of schools and hospitals as military \r\ntargets, including its grave consequences, which are \r\nto deprive children of their basic rights to education \r\nand health. The Group of African States agrees that \r\nviolence against children hampers the full enjoyment \r\nof their rights and their well-being. The international \r\n14-64058 13/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\ncommunity should continue to coordinate its efforts, \r\nincluding through the allocation of appropriate funds, \r\nto ensure child protection, child welfare and access to \r\nhealth and education, and to end all forms of violence \r\nagainst children.\r\nThe well-being of Africa’s children depends \r\nentirely on the well-being of their families and \r\ncommunities. The African Group therefore believes \r\nthat interventions directed towards children must also \r\ntake a family-centred approach that gives appropriate \r\nattention to their families. Young people undergo a \r\nvariety of new experiences. They need appropriate \r\nguidance that will ultimately contribute meaningfully \r\nto their personal development as well as to that of \r\ntheir societies. The African States are convinced that \r\nchildren’s rights, welfare and protection are at the core \r\nof human social development. As such, the African \r\nStates have committed themselves individually and \r\ncollectively to take the necessary steps and measures to \r\nensure the protection, survival and development of the \r\nchild in conformity with the Convention on the Rights \r\nof the Child and the African Charter on the Rights and \r\nWelfare of the Child.\r\nThe African Heads of States and Government \r\nadopted an African Common Position on the rights of \r\nthe child in 2001 in Cairo. That was further reviewed in \r\n2007. The review gave an opportunity for the African \r\nStates to take stock of the achievements and remaining \r\nchallenges. It also determined that much more needed \r\nto be done — hence the call for accelerated action to \r\nimplement the Plan of Action towards an Africa Fit \r\nfor Children (2008-2012) during the African Union \r\nSummit in January 2008.\r\nAt the continental level, the issue of child \r\nmarriage is a common concern that is being addressed \r\nindividually and collectively. African States have \r\nlaunched a campaign to end child marriage in Africa. \r\nThe Group of African States request international \r\nsupport for the African Union Goodwill Ambassador to \r\nEnd Child Marriage, Ms. Nyaradzayi Gumbonzvanda. \r\nShe has been tasked with promoting advocacy and \r\nraising awareness on the effects of child marriage. The \r\nGroup of African States believes that child marriage \r\nperpetuates problems relating to health, lack of \r\neducation, gender-based violence, abuse, exploitation, \r\ninadequate access to nutrition and services, and the \r\nlack of participation in economic opportunities.\r\nAllow me to conclude by saying that, as we \r\ndefine the implementation framework of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda and the African Union Vision \r\n2063, the African child remains vulnerable owing, \r\namong other issues, to conflicts, inequalities in income \r\nand health, unemployment, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, \r\nEbola, poverty and hunger, illiteracy and poor-quality \r\neducation, the vagaries of the economic and financial \r\ncrises, climate change, restricted access to health \r\nservices and information, as well as exposure to various \r\nforms of discrimination. It is therefore important to \r\ngive due consideration to the protection and well-being \r\nof children in the sustainable development framework. \r\nThat will help ensure that children, who are our future, \r\nare guaranteed the needed peace and security, social \r\ninvestment and appropriate child protection policies \r\ncrucial to the development of their full capabilities.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Asia-Pacific States.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): I have the distinct \r\nhonour to make a statement on behalf of the States \r\nmembers of the Group of Asia-Pacific States, all of \r\nwhich have ratified the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child. We thank you, Sir, for convening today’s \r\nmeeting to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary \r\nof the Convention. We also thank UNICEF Executive \r\nDirector Anthony Lake and other speakers for their \r\nthoughtful statements this morning.\r\nOn this occasion, we congratulate Malala Yousafzai \r\nand Kailash Satyarthi for jointly winning the 2014 \r\nNobel Peace Prize for their outstanding contribution \r\nto the promotion and protection of children’s rights. \r\nAt age 17, the courageous and committed Malala has \r\nbecome the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize \r\nand a global icon for the right to education. Kailash is \r\nthe architect of the single largest civil-society network \r\nagainst the exploitation of children and has devoted \r\nhis entire life to that cause. We salute both of them \r\nand support the sublime causes that they espouse and \r\nadvocate.\r\nToday is a historic day. As we celebrate the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of \r\nthe Child, we have a good opportunity to review the \r\nprogress made so far and identify the challenges that lie \r\nahead. The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention \r\ncoincides with the culmination of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and an intense process to craft the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, based on sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. The rights of the child sit at the very \r\ncentre of all those processes.\r\n14/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nChildren are the most precious asset of humankind \r\nand the builders of its future. Investment in children \r\nis not just smart economics, but a compelling moral \r\nobligation and a global common good. The landmark \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child has brought \r\nus far towards making the world safe and secure for \r\nchildren, without discrimination. The Convention and \r\nits two Protocols have stimulated significant progress \r\nin the normative structure and practical outcomes \r\naimed at improving the quality of the lives of children \r\nall around the world.\r\nLet us first look at the successes. In the past twenty-\r\nfive years, under-five mortality has been halved. New \r\nHIV infections among children have declined, and the \r\nnumber of out-of-school children has been reduced by \r\nhalf. There has been a decrease in child labour among \r\nboys and girls. Violence against children and other \r\nharmful practices against them have gained greater \r\nawareness within Governments and societies. The \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child has inspired \r\nMember States to enact new laws and improve existing \r\nmechanisms to protect the rights and interests of \r\nchildren.\r\nNow let us look at the glass as only half full. We \r\nhave a long way to go in order to fully protect children’s \r\nrights. As we speak, approximately 57 million children \r\nare not enrolled in primary schools, and 69 million are \r\nnot attending secondary schools. Nearly 700 million \r\nchildren face extreme poverty. Some 168 million \r\nchildren are engaged in child labour. Undernutrition \r\nremains a major challenge, causing stunting, disease and \r\nthe death of children living in the developing countries. \r\nChildren constitute more than half of the global refugee \r\npopulation. Millions are caught in conflicts, and many \r\nfall victim to sexual abuse.\r\nThe States of the Asia-Pacific Group underscore \r\nthe need for a determined push and concerted efforts \r\nto redress those remaining deficits and overcome \r\nchallenges in the next 15 years. We should start early \r\nand accelerate our speed to achieve our objectives. \r\nOur priorities should be the elimination of poverty, \r\nthe promotion of education and health and the holistic \r\ndevelopment of children.\r\nThe Group of Asia-Pacific States stresses the need \r\nto include sufficient, tangible and credible means of \r\nimplementation for the effective and full realization \r\nof all child-related goals and targets. In that regard, \r\nthe third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, to be held in Addis Ababa in July 2015, \r\nshould pay special attention to resources for children. \r\nAll sustainable development goals, particularly those \r\nlinked to the rights of children, should be given special \r\nattention in terms of the provision of adequate financial \r\nresources.\r\nLet me reiterate the firm and abiding commitment \r\nof the Group of Asia-Pacific States to the principles \r\nof the Convention on the Rights of the Child and \r\nto the full realization of the rights of the child. The \r\nGroup will support the efforts of the United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund and the United Nations as a whole to \r\nmaintain a sharp focus on the rights of the child in the \r\nemerging post-2015 development agenda and beyond.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child promises full \r\nand healthy growth and development for all children all \r\nover the world. Let us work to fulfil that promise, and \r\nlet us celebrate the fact that the Convention builds our \r\nresilience to pursue that goal.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Georgia, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): It is a particular honour \r\nfor my delegation to take the f loor on behalf of the \r\nEastern European States to celebrate the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child, which constitutes the standard in \r\nthe promotion and protection of the rights of children. \r\nThis high-level meeting gives us an opportunity to take \r\nstock of the achievements in ensuring the protection \r\nand well-being of children, to reflect on remaining \r\nimplementation gaps and to redouble our efforts to \r\nundertake additional measures to ensure children’s \r\nrights.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, the Convention was the \r\nfirst international treaty that recognized the child as a \r\nsubject with rights and became the most widely ratified \r\nhuman rights treaty in history, obliging States to \r\nassume responsibility for ensuring the full protection \r\nof the rights of children. The Convention is a major \r\nmilestone in ensuring children’s right to life, survival \r\nand development, protection and empowerment. \r\nThe Convention, with its holistic approach to child \r\ndevelopment, contributed greatly to creating the \r\nconditions for children around the globe to grow in an \r\nenvironment with access to health, nutrition, safety and \r\nsecurity. The implementation of the Convention and its \r\nOptional Protocols will mark another significant step \r\nin advancing the child-protection agenda.\r\n14-64058 15/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nWe have Ms. Anna Komorowska, the First \r\nLady of Poland, present here today to celebrate this \r\ncommemorative date with us. I would like to welcome \r\nher along with the other guests. Her presence proves the \r\ngreat importance that Poland and our Group attach to \r\nthe promotion and protection of the rights of children.\r\nSince the adoption of the Convention, States have \r\nworked intensely to improve domestic legislation, \r\nstandards and policies to better protect children. As a \r\nresult, we have much to celebrate. As outlined in the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General entitled “Status of the \r\nConvention on the Rights of the Child” (A/69/260), \r\nsignificant progress has been achieved in the past \r\nquarter-century in all dimensions of the child-protection \r\nagenda. Nevertheless, the remaining implementation \r\ngaps and pressing global challenges demand stronger \r\ncommitment to the cause of the protection and \r\nempowerment of children.\r\nChild mortality, the subject of one of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, remains the most serious challenge \r\nof our time. In recent years, the global under-five \r\nmortality rate has been almost halved, and new HIV \r\ninfections among children under 15 years of age have \r\ndeclined by 35 per cent, but we need to continue striving \r\nto ensure higher standards of health care for children so \r\nas to provide them with timely access to the appropriate \r\nhealth-care and rehabilitation services.\r\nViolence against children remains a major challenge. \r\nMillions of children continue to suffer various forms \r\nof violence, exploitation, abuse and neglect. We need \r\nto take more effective steps to address the root causes \r\nof that problem. We are particularly concerned for \r\nchildren affected by armed conflicts, who bear the \r\nburden of war and its atrocities.\r\nChildren with disabilities are particularly vulnerable \r\nto poverty, marginalization and exclusion. They often \r\nlack access to protection and assistance, and are more \r\nlikely to be victims of violence.\r\nEducation is critical for the development and \r\nempowerment of children. Much has been achieved in \r\nthat respect, but the widespread inequities affecting the \r\npoorest and most vulnerable children remain a huge \r\nbarrier for the realization of the full potential of all \r\nchildren.\r\nIn that regard, we take the opportunity to commend \r\nUNICEF’s leadership in the protection of children and \r\nthe promotion of children’s rights. Over the years, \r\nUNICEF has made significant progress in many \r\nareas relating to child protection and has contributed \r\nimmensely to improving children’s lives and advancing \r\nthe child agenda around the world. We reiterate our \r\ncommitment to continue to cooperate with UNICEF for \r\nrenewed global action in the best interests of children.\r\nToday, on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Convention, we would like to reiterate \r\nour strong commitment to the advancement of the \r\nrights of children. We have to aim for an ambitious, \r\nrights-based post-2015 development agenda, which is \r\nfundamental for ensuring that children feel safe and \r\nhave opportunities to realize their rights. We need \r\nto implement our existing commitments and seek \r\ninnovative ways to advance the rights of the most \r\nmarginalized. Let us strive to live up to the expectations \r\nof those who will be shaping our future tomorrow.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Guatemala, who will speak on behalf \r\nof the Group of Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Carrera Castro (Guatemala): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to say a few words of congratulation to the \r\nyoung lady from Swaziland, Ms. Teyise Dlamini, on \r\nher very inspiring words to this meeting. I would also \r\nlike to congratulate UNICEF for the beautiful event we \r\nhad this morning. As a former UNICEF staff member, \r\nI take a lot of pride in what UNICEF continues to do. \r\nThere are many friends present today who have worked \r\ntogether with me in that regard.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the Group \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States. The countries \r\nof our regional Group remain strongly committed to the \r\npromotion and protection of the rights of children, and \r\nwe welcome the commemoration of the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the \r\nRights of the Child as an occasion for us to celebrate \r\nthe accomplishments, reflect on implementation gaps \r\nand undertake additional measures to ensure that the \r\nrights of children are fully realized.\r\nAs States parties to the Convention, we fully support \r\nall mechanisms that contribute to its implementation, in \r\nparticular the Committee on the Rights of the Child. We \r\nreaffirm that States have the primary responsibility to \r\npromote and protect all human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, including the rights of children. We firmly \r\nbelieve that the full enjoyment of those rights and \r\n16/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nfundamental freedoms can be realized, free from \r\ndiscrimination of any kind, through the implementation \r\nof appropriate policies, even with limited resources. It \r\nis important in that regard for the actions and policies \r\npursued by those involved in issues related to children \r\nto take into account the basic principle of preserving \r\nthe best interests of the child and a gender perspective, \r\nin the light of the particular situation of our girls.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the steps taken to achieve a world fit for children \r\n(A/69/258). As the report says, there is much to celebrate \r\non the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention, from \r\ndeclining infant mortality to rising school enrolment. \r\nHowever, although the international community has \r\nachieved significant progress in the past years, global \r\naverages, as UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake \r\npointed out, often mask growing inequalities in key \r\nindicators, and millions of children are also affected \r\nby sociopolitical crises, armed conflicts and natural \r\ndisasters. We are also concerned by the global figures \r\nreporting that 47 per cent of people living in extreme \r\npoverty are 18 years old or younger.\r\nWe also express our appreciation for the report \r\non the status of the Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild (A/69/260). The Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States believes that the signature, ratification \r\nand effective implementation of the Convention and its \r\nOptional Protocols will significantly help to ensure \r\nthat all children fully enjoy their human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. We therefore urge States that \r\nhave not yet done so to become parties to the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child, the Optional Protocols \r\nthereto on the sale of children, child prostitution \r\nand child pornography, and on the involvement of \r\nchildren in armed conflict as a matter of priority and to \r\nimplement them fully.\r\nThe Group takes note with appreciation of the \r\nentry into force on 14 April of the Optional Protocol \r\nto the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a \r\ncommunications procedure for reporting individual or \r\nmass violations of children’s rights. We urge States to \r\nconsider signing, ratifying and implementing it.\r\nAlthough substantial progress benefiting children \r\nhas been made in the region, it remains crucial that \r\nwe work to assist those living in extreme poverty and \r\nto reduce persistent disparities in health, education \r\nand other key child well-being indicators, which are \r\nclosely interlinked developmental challenges. We must \r\nensure that the post-2015 development agenda includes \r\nthe poorest and most vulnerable children around the \r\nworld — children with disabilities, indigenous children, \r\nchildren of African descent and migrant children.\r\nThe leadership of our region in advancing the agenda \r\nof the rights of children is well recognized. However, as \r\na region comprising mostly middle-income countries, \r\nwe still have significant challenges and vulnerabilities \r\nto fully protect their rights. Vulnerabilities result from \r\npoverty and inequality, but also from cultural and social \r\nfactors such as discrimination and gender inequalities. \r\nThe progress achieved is also threatened by several \r\nrisks, such as national or global crises in the economic or \r\npolitical arena, natural disasters, and multidimensional \r\nchallenges such as violence and organized crime, which \r\naffect primarily the most vulnerable groups within our \r\npopulation.\r\nWe therefore attach great importance to international \r\ncooperation, including the efforts carried out by the \r\nUnited Nations system and its agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes, particularly UNICEF, which serve to \r\npromote the development of all countries and provide \r\nsupport to the design, implementation and evaluation \r\nof national public policies promoting the well-being of \r\nchildren and adolescents.\r\nWe agree that the participation of communities and \r\nchildren, especially those who are marginalized and at \r\nrisk, is vitally important in national and local planning, \r\nin national and municipal budgeting, and in the \r\nmonitoring of risk assessment, as well as in prevention, \r\nemergency preparedness, response and recovery. All of \r\nthose factors together strengthen resilience, especially \r\nat the local level, as indicated in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport.\r\nThe important role of the media must also be \r\nrecognized as a useful tool for raising awareness \r\nwithin society regarding the situation of children and \r\nthe challenges they face. We reaffirm the significant \r\nrole of the media in initiatives to promote and protect \r\nchildren’s rights, the contribution of the media to \r\nchildren’s education and the need to pay attention to \r\nthe media’s influence, at times negative, on children.\r\nWe must remain focused on ensuring that children’s \r\nrights and well-being are major priorities in the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, which require eradicating \r\nextreme poverty, reducing inequalities, eliminating \r\nall forms of violence against children and ensuring \r\nuniversal access to justice, in particular for children, \r\nwhen necessary. Such efforts could provide an \r\n14-64058 17/18\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.56\r\nappropriate platform to promote and uphold the human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms of today’s children, \r\nwho are, lest we forget, the global leaders of tomorrow.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Germany, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Western European and Other States.\r\nMr. Thoms (Germany): I have the great honour to \r\ntake the f loor on behalf of the States members of the \r\nGroup of Western European and other States.\r\nWe wholeheartedly welcome the initiative to hold \r\nthis commemorative event, celebrating 25 years of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Rights of the \r\nChild. As we have repeatedly heard this morning, \r\nit is the world’s most ratified human rights treaty \r\nto date — an achievement we can be proud of. This \r\nanniversary provides the membership of the United \r\nNations with the opportunity to collectively reflect \r\nnot only on the Convention itself, but on the concrete \r\nsituation of children the world over, because there is \r\nlittle use celebrating the Convention’s anniversary \r\nhere today if we make no link to how it has improved \r\nthe futures of those whom it is meant to benefit. In \r\nother words, even on the Convention’s twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary, we must continue to focus on effective \r\nimplementation — and I dare say that implementation \r\nis bound to remain a work in progress for all of us.\r\nYet, we have ample reason to be satisfied with what \r\nwe have achieved in the past 25 years. States have come \r\ntogether to protect the world’s most valuable asset — our \r\nchildren. We should therefore celebrate the fact that \r\nthe Convention is now almost universally ratified. In \r\naddition, the international community has achieved the \r\nentry into force of three additional Protocols, which \r\nmake the protection of children and their rights more \r\nspecific, the last of which entered into force in April.\r\nMoreover, we welcome the work of the Committee \r\non the Rights of the Child. For the past 25 years, its \r\nexperts have kept the spirit of the Convention alive \r\nand diligently advised States on how to improve \r\nimplementation and adherence. We would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to congratulate the Committee \r\non its efforts and wish it continued success in its \r\nconsiderations.\r\nIn the same vein, we would like to recognize the \r\nmandate-holders involved in protecting the rights of \r\nchildren. It is their personal effort that contributes \r\nto the strength of the Convention. We applaud their \r\nengagement and their unfailing dedication to the \r\nprinciples enshrined within it. We must also extend \r\nour sincere appreciation to UNICEF, its Executive \r\nDirector and his staff, many of whom work and live in \r\ndifficult conditions. We would also like to remember \r\nthose members of UNICEF staff who have been injured \r\nor killed while championing children’s rights over the \r\npast 25 years. It is also their dedication to children that \r\nwe celebrate here today. This appreciation extends, of \r\ncourse, to all other United Nations agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes. When it comes to children’s rights, the \r\nUnited Nations has no excuse but to deliver as one.\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of the Child offers a \r\ntimeless vision for our world. It sets out a world where all \r\nchildren can live to develop their potential. It envisages \r\na childhood free from violence and discrimination. \r\nIt emphasizes an environment where children are \r\nencouraged to participate in decisions that affect their \r\nlives. Some of that has been implemented. According \r\nto UNICEF, far fewer children die before their fifth \r\nbirthday than did 25 years ago, more children are able \r\nto realize their right to an education and the proportion \r\nof people — and children — living in extreme poverty \r\nhas decreased. In addition, in every region of the \r\nworld, the Convention has inspired changes in laws and \r\nregulations to better protect children, altered the way \r\ninternational organizations see their work for children \r\nand transformed the way in which children are able to \r\ntake an active role and participate in their communities \r\nand societies.\r\nYet, we have to acknowledge that after 25 years \r\nof the Convention, many challenges remain. About \r\n3,500 children will have died by the end of this meeting \r\ntonight, mostly from entirely preventable causes. Every \r\n10 minutes, an adolescent girl is violently killed. Eleven \r\nper cent of girls worldwide are married before they turn \r\n15. Hazardous child labour remains prolific, and many \r\nchildren do not, therefore, receive a formal education. \r\nThere are nearly 230 million children under age of 5 \r\nworldwide whose births have never been officially \r\nrecorded. I could go on like this, but allow me to leave \r\nit there.\r\nA great deal more needs to be done to fulfil the \r\nvision that the Convention on the Rights of the Child \r\nsets out for us. It is our wish that the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary will provide new impetus for more action. \r\nAnd we believe that the United Nations, both as an \r\norganization and as a platform, has much to offer in \r\nthat regard.\r\n18/18 14-64058\r\nA/69/PV.56 20/11/2014\r\nIn the context of the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe Convention, it is especially fitting that the Nobel \r\nPeace Prize this year will be awarded to two defenders \r\nof children’s rights, one of them herself still a child. \r\nThe award underlines the important contribution of \r\ncivil society and human rights defenders. Although the \r\nprimary responsibility to protect, promote and fulfil \r\nhuman rights lies with States, civil society’s leadership \r\non children’s rights has and continues to be indispensable \r\nfor the implementation of the Convention on the Rights \r\nof the Child. States must, therefore, take all necessary \r\nmeasures to protect civil-society organizations from \r\nviolence, threats, retaliation, adverse discrimination, \r\npressure or any other arbitrary action.\r\nWe are confident that when States and civil society \r\nwork together, we can create a positive change for \r\nchildren. New technologies and innovative approaches \r\nto development will make this world a better place for \r\nthem. By drawing on the skills and expertise of all people \r\neverywhere — across countries and cultures — we can \r\nachieve a sustainable implementation of the Convention \r\non the Rights of the Child. In that way, we can protect \r\nfuture generations, promote their rights and create \r\nprosperous societies. It is with that spirit of optimism \r\nthat I would like to close this statement.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker for \r\nthe high-level meeting on the occasion of the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item \r\n64.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
