"*1464064*\r\n14-64064 (E)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Antoine \r\n(Grenada), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 37\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/69/540)\r\nDraft resolution (A/69/L.20)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Germany to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.20.\r\nMr. Thoms (Germany): It is an honour for my \r\ncountry to introduce this year’s draft resolution on the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan (A/69/L.20). The year 2014 \r\nhas been marked by seminal developments in Afghan \r\ndomestic and foreign politics, and the draft resolution \r\nbefore us today reflects all the facets of those key \r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan.\r\nDespite the variety of topics worthy of our \r\nattention, I will limit myself today to briefly \r\nhighlighting a few key developments. Afghanistan has \r\nsuccessfully concluded its presidential and provincial \r\ncouncil elections. For the first time in the country’s \r\nhistory, power was peacefully transferred from one \r\nAdministration to another by a democratic process. \r\nOn 29 September, President Ghani was inaugurated \r\nand, together with Mr. Abdullah, the Chief Executive \r\nOfficer, will form a Government of national unity. \r\nThe Afghan people — men and, most encouragingly, \r\nmillions of women — have shown tremendous courage \r\nin making use of their constitutional right to cast their \r\nvote, defying the Taliban’s threats to attack the election \r\nprocess. We commend the United Nations and the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for the \r\ncritical support they provided to the Afghan electoral \r\ninstitutions during that process. Germany, along with \r\nother partners from the international community, also \r\nsupported the process with substantial contributions.\r\nIt is now essential that both Afghanistan’s President \r\nand its Chief Executive Officer continue to work \r\ntogether closely, on a basis of mutual trust, to tackle \r\nthe many challenges that lie ahead for Afghanistan. \r\nElectoral reform and the strengthening of electoral \r\ninstitutions, along with constitutional reforms, are at \r\nthe core of the agreement on establishing a Government \r\nof national unity and must be addressed in a timely \r\nmanner. Economic reforms must be tackled swiftly \r\nin order to foster economic growth and create job \r\nopportunities for the benefit of the entire population. \r\nSevere budgetary constraints and a volatile security \r\nsituation demand effective decision-making processes \r\non the part of the Government. As Germany’s Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Mr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, \r\nunderlined during his recent visit to Afghanistan, all \r\nactors in the Government of national unity must embrace \r\ntheir responsibility for the future of Afghanistan and \r\ncontinue to set aside personal ambitions.\r\nSecondly, the draft resolution reflects the remarkable \r\nshift in the security transition that Afghanistan and \r\nits international partners are approaching. In less \r\nthan six weeks, the International Security Assistance \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.57\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n57th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 20 November 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n2/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nForce mission will come to an end, and the Afghan \r\nnational security forces will assume full responsibility \r\nfor providing security to the Afghan people. Since the \r\ntransition process began, the Afghan National Army \r\nand the Afghan Local Police have continued to improve \r\ntheir capacities and have proved increasingly capable of \r\nresponding to security challenges, albeit at a high cost. \r\nChallenges still remain, and the achievements attained \r\nso far are not yet irreversible.\r\nThe draft resolution therefore underlines the \r\ninternational community’s resolve to further support \r\nthe Afghan security forces beyond the transition. \r\nAt the NATO Wales Summit, NATO and its partner \r\ncountries renewed their commitment to continuing \r\ntheir support to the Afghan national security forces. \r\nAt the beginning of 2015, at the invitation of the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan, they will establish the \r\nResolute Support Mission for training, assisting \r\nand advising the national security forces. They will \r\ncontribute to the financial support of the Afghan \r\nsecurity forces and have committed to strengthening \r\nthe long-term enduring partnership with Afghanistan. \r\nThe German Government has also offered to continue \r\nsupporting the Afghan security forces. We commend \r\nthe new Government of Afghanistan for expeditiously \r\nsigning a bilateral security agreement with the United \r\nStates and a status-of-forces agreement with NATO, \r\nboth necessary preconditions for the international \r\ncommunity’s continued support.\r\nLater this year in London, Afghanistan and its \r\ninternational partners will meet to refresh the long-term \r\ncommitment of the international community throughout \r\nthe transformation decade. That commitment, declared \r\nby the Government of Afghanistan and its international \r\npartners at the Bonn Conference of 2011 and reaffirmed \r\nat the Tokyo Conference in 2012, rests firmly on the \r\nprinciple of mutual accountability. Building on that \r\nunique framework, the international community \r\nhas pledged $16 billion through 2015 in support of \r\nAfghanistan’s economic and political stabilization. In \r\naddition, it has committed to sustaining its support at \r\nor near the levels of the past decade through 2017, in \r\nline with the principles of aid effectiveness. In return, \r\nthe Afghan Government has committed to working \r\nmore determinedly to achieve its governance and \r\ndevelopment goals.\r\nDuring the past decade, Afghanistan has indeed \r\nmade remarkable progress in a variety of areas, \r\nincluding health, education and infrastructure. \r\nHowever, continued efforts are of paramount importance \r\nfor protecting and advancing the gains made in past \r\nyears. As the draft resolution reflects, preserving and \r\nconsolidating gains in the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights and the equal participation of men and \r\nwomen in all spheres of Afghan life remain critical. \r\nGood governance and the fight against corruption must \r\nbe strengthened, a goal that the new Afghan President \r\ncommitted his Administration to in his inaugural \r\nspeech. Finally, the Istanbul Heart of Asia process, \r\naimed at enhancing regional cooperation and dialogue, \r\ntook a step forward at the most recent Ministerial \r\nConference, held in Beijing in October. As a supporting \r\ncountry to the process, Germany is looking forward to \r\nseeing progress in tapping its full potential to foster \r\ntrust and cooperation in the region between now and the \r\nnext Ministerial Conference, which the Government of \r\nPakistan has generously offered to host.\r\nThose watershed developments suggest that the \r\nlong-term partnership between Afghanistan and the \r\ninternational community is evolving. It is essential to \r\nunderstand, however, that the very redefinition of the \r\nrelationship should reinforce it. That is also the core \r\nmessage of the draft resolution before us today.\r\nThe new Afghan Government assumed its duties \r\nonly a few weeks ago. It faces tremendous challenges, \r\nand the Government of national unity has clearly stated, \r\nand already demonstrated, its determination to tackle \r\nthose challenges with vigour. We are confident that \r\nthat resolve to improve the lives of Afghan citizens will \r\nguide the new Government in its work. By adopting \r\nthis draft resolution today and once again by consensus, \r\nthe General Assembly will reaffirm its commitment \r\nto a prosperous and peaceful future for Afghanistan \r\nand send a strong message of support to the Afghan \r\nGovernment and people.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my gratitude \r\nto all the delegations that participated in this year’s \r\ninformal consultations, and in particular to my \r\ncolleague Ambassador Tanin and his team for their \r\ndedication and close cooperation.\r\nMr. Tanin (Afghanistan): As we come together \r\nin the General Assembly to adopt this year’s draft \r\nresolution on the situation in Afghanistan (A/69/L.20), \r\nI would like to thank all the Member States that have \r\nparticipated in its negotiation. I would also like to thank \r\nAmbassadors Braun and Thoms, and their team at the \r\nPermanent Mission of Germany to the United Nations, \r\n14-64064 3/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nparticularly Daniel Schemske, for their hard work in \r\nfacilitating the negotiations.\r\nAt the end of this year, the Government of \r\nAfghanistan will take full responsibility for the \r\ncountry’s security. The mandate of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force, authorized by the Security \r\nCouncil under Chapter VII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, is set to expire on 31 December, and \r\nAfghanistan will then move towards a more normalized \r\ninternational status as a sovereign nation. We have been \r\nstriving to reach that moment for the past decade. It is \r\na major accomplishment and an important step towards \r\nachieving a peaceful, sovereign and prosperous \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nWhile NATO’s combat role will end, Afghanistan \r\nand NATO remain committed to a long-term strategic \r\npartnership. NATO will continue to train, advise and \r\nassist the Afghan national defence and security forces \r\nbeyond 2014 through its Resolute Support Mission, on \r\nthe basis of the NATO-Afghanistan status-of-forces \r\nagreement and the security and defence cooperation \r\nagreement between Afghanistan and the United States \r\nof America. We welcome the Assembly’s message of \r\nsupport for the new mission. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to express my Government’s profound \r\ngratitude to all the international civilian and military \r\nmen and women who have served shoulder to shoulder \r\nwith their Afghan partners in working for a better \r\nfuture for the people of Afghanistan. The Afghan \r\npeople will always remember and honour their sacrifice \r\nand dedication.\r\nAfghanistan has emerged from a historic election \r\nthat marked its first democratic transfer of power \r\nfrom one President to the next, an important milestone \r\nin Afghanistan’s multifaceted transition. While the \r\nchallenges that arose during the election period tested \r\nour resolve, the wisdom of the country’s leadership and \r\nthe support of its friends and partners have enabled us to \r\novercome the difficulties and move towards a unified, \r\npeaceful, democratic and prosperous future. The \r\nestablishment of a Government of national unity has \r\ncreated an atmosphere of broader political inclusivity \r\nand participation. It will enable Afghans from all walks \r\nof life to contribute to the country’s economic and \r\nsocial development, to the sustainability of the Afghan \r\nState and its security forces and to peace and security \r\nin Afghanistan and the wider region.\r\nThe newly elected President of Afghanistan, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, \r\ntogether with the national unity Government, \r\nis vigorously pursuing a comprehensive reform \r\nprogramme aimed at delivering on the campaign \r\npromises and promoting peace, stability and prosperity \r\nacross the country. I would like to highlight three key \r\ncomponents of that comprehensive reform agenda.\r\nThe first is eliminating corruption. Corruption \r\ncorrodes State effectiveness, security, public faith \r\nin Government and progress towards peace and \r\nprosperity. It feeds insurgency, patronage and illegal \r\ninterests. Tackling corruption is crucial to the \r\nGovernment’s reform agenda. In his inaugural address, \r\nPresident Ghani stressed his policy of zero tolerance \r\nfor corruption. As soon as he assumed the presidency, \r\nhe ordered the Supreme Court to reopen an inquiry into \r\nthe Kabul Bank fraud case. Since then, the Court has \r\nsentenced the bank’s executives to 15 years in prison, \r\nordered the payment of substantial fines and frozen the \r\nassets of those accused of corruption. Other suspects \r\nwill now be investigated for their involvement in the \r\n$900 million embezzlement scandal. That courageous \r\nstep demonstrates the Government’s firm commitment \r\nto eradicating corruption and ending impunity.\r\nOn strengthening democratic accountability, \r\ngovernance and the rule of law, Afghanistan’s leadership \r\nis in the process of establishing a functional, merit-\r\nbased cabinet as part of a wider commitment to building \r\neffective governance at every level. In addition, we \r\nwill reform electoral institutions, electoral processes \r\nand the relevant laws, as well as adopt the necessary \r\namendments to the Constitution. The Government \r\nwill also focus on reforming the judiciary and all law- \r\nenforcement institutions, inter alia by taking concrete \r\nactions to expand access to justice and uphold the \r\nrights of all Afghan citizens, particularly women and \r\ngirls. I would like to call attention to the Government’s \r\nrecent adoption of the Afghanistan national action plan \r\nfor women, peace and security, which represents an \r\nimportant step in that regard.\r\nWith regard to promoting economic growth and \r\nsocial development, the national unity Government is \r\ncommitted to economic reforms that stimulate growth \r\nand tackle poverty, inequality and unemployment. \r\nThey include strengthening cooperation between the \r\nGovernment and the private sector, removing obstacles \r\nto investment and trade, promoting sustainable \r\nlivelihoods, reinvigorating counter-narcotics efforts \r\nand using aid effectively to reinforce development and \r\nstability. The continuing implementation of the Tokyo \r\n4/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nMutual Accountability Framework remains central to \r\nthose efforts, and we look forward to the next Ministerial \r\nMeeting on Afghanistan to be held in London next \r\nmonth. I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe United Kingdom for hosting that important meeting.\r\nThe Afghan people have been the victims of \r\nterrorism and violence for almost 40 years. The violence \r\nperpetrated by terrorists, extremists and illegal armed \r\ngroups continues to have daily, devastating impacts on \r\nall civilians, particularly women and children, and poses \r\nthe greatest obstacle to political, economic and social \r\nprogress in the country. The Afghan National Security \r\nForces continue to demonstrate professionalism and \r\ncourage in protecting the Afghan people. Moving \r\nforward, the national unity Government will work \r\ntirelessly to continue to strengthen the capacity of the \r\nAfghan national security forces to uphold the security \r\nof the nation and to preserve the achievements of the \r\nlast decade. The continuing support of our international \r\npartners, in particular through the new NATO mission, \r\nis crucial to the success of those efforts.\r\nBut the country will not achieve peace through \r\nmilitary efforts alone. President Ghani has called on \r\nall armed opponents of the Government to enter into \r\npolitical talks and play their part in building a strong \r\nand successful Afghanistan. The Government of \r\nAfghanistan is working to establish a wider, inclusive \r\npolitical framework for lasting peace, including a new \r\noutreach to the armed opposition and efforts at national \r\nreconciliation. This is an Afghan-led and Afghan-\r\nowned process, but, at the same time, we recognize the \r\nimportant role of regional and neighbouring countries, \r\nparticularly the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, in \r\ncontributing to our efforts to end the conflict. President \r\nGhani initiated serious efforts to further a political \r\nsettlement during his recent visits to Saudi Arabia, China \r\nand Pakistan and in his meetings and conversations \r\nwith the leaders of neighbouring, regional and partner \r\ncountries.\r\nRegional cooperation is key not only to peace and \r\nsecurity but also to prosperity in Afghanistan and the \r\nwider region. In that connection, the Government of \r\nAfghanistan is committed to deepening cooperation \r\nwith its neighbours and regional partners. Last week, \r\nPresident Ghani paid a historic visit to the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan, where the leaders of the two \r\ncountries opened a friendly, forward-looking dialogue \r\nand made concrete agreements relating to improving \r\nbilateral economic, trade and investment relations. The \r\nvisit generated an unprecedented surge of optimism and \r\nset the groundwork for long-term cooperation between \r\nthe two nations.\r\nIn October, President Ghani conducted another \r\nhistoric State visit to the People’s Republic of China, \r\nwhere bold steps were taken towards increasing \r\ncooperation in the areas of economic development and \r\nstabilization. The visit coincided with the annual Heart \r\nof Asia Ministerial Conference in Beijing on 31 October, \r\nwhich reaffirmed commitments to strengthen regional \r\nsecurity and cooperation for a secure and stable \r\nAfghanistan. We are grateful to the Government of \r\nChina for its leadership and for hosting the meeting, \r\nand we thank the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for \r\nagreeing to host the next ministerial meeting of the \r\nIstanbul process in 2015. The President of Afghanistan \r\nlooks forward to furthering regional engagement and \r\nwill therefore attend the upcoming summit of the South \r\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation at the end \r\nof this month in Kathmandu.\r\nDeepening regional cooperation will open the \r\ndoors to a f lourishing continental economy in the heart \r\nof Asia. Afghanistan has great potential to enhance \r\nthe development and prosperity of the entire region by \r\nunlocking the country’s capacity to serve as a hub for \r\nconnectivity and trade across Asia. That will entail key \r\nenergy and power projects, such as the Turkmenistan-\r\nAfghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline and the Central \r\nAsia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade \r\nProject, as well as the building of a wide regional \r\ntransport network, including railways and highways. \r\nAll regional partners can play a role by working \r\ntogether and engaging chambers of commerce and \r\nbusiness communities in joint and coordinated action \r\nto turn potential into reality.\r\nAs the new Government focuses on renewed \r\nregional cooperation, our long-term partnerships \r\nwith the wider international community remain the \r\nbackbone of our efforts for peace, security, stability \r\nand prosperity in Afghanistan. The support of the \r\ninternational community has allowed us to build a \r\nnew Afghanistan and will continue to be crucial in \r\nthe transformation decade ahead. The President’s \r\nupcoming visit to London to attend the London \r\nConference on Afghanistan and his upcoming visit to \r\nthe United States will be important steps in refreshing \r\nand furthering our mutual cooperation and partnership \r\nwith the international community.\r\n14-64064 5/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nThe past 13 years have seen the international \r\ncommunity’s unprecedented engagement in supporting \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan in its efforts to build \r\npeace and stability. While the goals set over a decade ago \r\nhave not been fully realized, Afghanistan is determined \r\nto bring sustainable peace, security and prosperity \r\nto the country with the support of our international \r\npartners. The Government of Afghanistan’s ambitious \r\nagenda of reform, the collaboration of all Afghan \r\npolitical forces and the support of the Afghan people \r\nwill enable us to put an end to the destructive narrative \r\nof toxic extremism and to reach the beginning of an \r\nera of peace. In doing so, we will change the course \r\nof history in the heart of Asia to the great benefit of \r\nour people, our neighbours, the wider region and the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Acting President: I call on the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Iceland, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the countries of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, as well as Ukraine, the Republic of \r\nMoldova, Armenia and Georgia align themselves with \r\nthis statement. I would like to thank all delegations \r\nthat have participated in the consultations on the draft \r\nresolution (A/69/L.20) and particularly the German \r\nteam for so ably facilitating the negotiations. We would \r\nalso like to thank Ambassador Tanin for his statement.\r\nLet me start by reiterating the European Union’s \r\nfull support for the continued important role played by \r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\n(UNAMA) and all the United Nations agencies \r\nthat support the Afghan people and coordinate \r\nthe international community’s assistance. As the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force mission \r\ncomes to an end and the international combat troops \r\nare withdrawn, the role of the United Nations will be \r\neven more important in assisting the Afghan authorities \r\nin their efforts to ensure that the gains achieved are \r\nsafeguarded and used as the foundation for further \r\nprogress.\r\nThe international community will soon meet \r\nin London at the Conference to be co-chaired by the \r\nGovernments of Afghanistan and the United Kingdom. \r\nThe Conference will be an occasion for the new \r\nAfghan Government to set out a serious and ambitious \r\nreform programme and to begin a process for reaching \r\nagreement on the refreshed mutual accountability \r\nframework that will be finalized at next year’s Senior \r\nOfficials Meeting.\r\nThe London Conference will also be an opportunity \r\nfor the international community to restate its long-\r\nterm commitment to support Afghanistan and to \r\nreaffirm existing financial commitments through 2017, \r\nunderpinned by the principle of mutual accountability. \r\nIt will also be an opportunity to consider the progress \r\nmade in the commitments set out in the Tokyo Mutual \r\nAccountability Framework, agreed at the Tokyo \r\nConference on Afghanistan in July 2012. Afghanistan \r\nhas been the beneficiary of unprecedented levels of \r\ninternational assistance, but it is vital that assistance \r\nbe sustained over the coming years, since it is critical \r\nthat Government revenues increase in the future. The \r\nEuropean Union is pleased to welcome the formation \r\nof the Government of national unity and has recently \r\nsigned an agreement to provide up to €1.4 billion over \r\nthe next seven years in development assistance. That \r\nmoney will be used, in line with the common EU \r\nstrategy, to strengthen Afghanistan’s institutions so as \r\nto enable Afghans to be responsible for securing the \r\ngains made over the last 13 years, as well as to make \r\nit possible to continue developing national institutions \r\nin line with the needs of the women and men of \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nGains can be secured only if the new Government \r\ncommits to enacting and implementing the critical \r\nreforms needed to improve economic and political \r\ngovernance in the country, including by tackling the \r\nwidespread problem of corruption. Urgent action is \r\nneeded to put in place the measures necessary to improve \r\nthe economic growth outlook and attract investment. \r\nOnly in that way can Afghanistan both create the jobs \r\nand increase the revenue that the country needs to truly \r\nstand on its own two feet. But investors are unlikely to \r\nrisk their capital, if Afghanistan does not improve the \r\nease of doing business in the country and, in particular, \r\nthe enforceability of contracts through a strengthened \r\nrule of law. Serious reforms are also needed with \r\nregard to tackling illicit narcotics, which contribute to \r\nsustaining the illicit economy.\r\nThe failure to remedy injustice, both real and \r\nperceived, has been one of the greatest failings of the \r\nprevious Afghan Administration and has provided \r\nan easy target for those opposed to the Government. \r\nThe new Government has taken the welcome step of \r\n6/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nreopening the investigation into the corrupt practices \r\nthat led to the collapse of the Kabul Bank. The European \r\nUnion also welcomes the appointment of a new Chief \r\nJustice and a new Attorney-General. It is vital to \r\nmaintain that reform momentum and to encourage \r\nall parts of the justice system to work together in a \r\nconstructive way to address systemic failures.\r\nAfghanistan has made good progress since 2001 in \r\naddressing the legacy of discrimination from the Taliban \r\nregime. While the European Union is fully supportive \r\nof a national reconciliation process in Afghanistan, we \r\nmust guard against the Taliban returning to its previous \r\nunacceptable practices. We need to see a democratic \r\nprocess that fully promotes and respects human rights \r\nand the rule of law, including the right of women and \r\ngirls to education and full participation in Afghan \r\nsociety. For its part, the European Union will extend \r\nthe mandate of its European Union Police Mission in \r\nAfghanistan and continue to support capacity-building \r\nof the Afghan police and the rule of law. Much of the \r\nlegal framework needed to recognize the equality of \r\nmen and women is now in place, but far greater and \r\nmore systematic action is required in order to ensure \r\nfull and adequate implementation, as well as women’s \r\nequal participation in decision-making processes across \r\nthe country.\r\nIn conclusion, all those challenges will require a \r\nstrong commitment from both the new Government and \r\nthe international community. The European Union and \r\nits member States will remain a steadfast partner, as set \r\nout in the new comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan, \r\nwhich was endorsed in June. We applaud the role \r\nplayed by UNAMA and reiterate the importance of the \r\nMission’s maintaining the countrywide presence that is \r\nso necessary for the ongoing delivery of international \r\nassistance.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I am honoured to take the f loor on behalf of \r\nthe States members of the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization (CSTO): the Republic of Armenia, the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic, the Russian Federation and the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan.\r\nThe Afghan people have just completed a very \r\nimportant stage in their history: the transfer of power \r\nfrom one elected head of State to another through \r\nthe mechanism of elections. We hope that the newly \r\nelected national leader will guide efforts towards \r\nachieving peace and progress in the country, and we \r\nwish all Afghans, as well as the new leadership, success \r\nand strength in tackling the problems before them. \r\nUnfortunately, there are many.\r\nEach of our countries supports close, friendly \r\nrelations with Afghanistan, based on mutual \r\nconsideration and equitable cooperation. We all have \r\na stake in seeing that a pessimistic prognosis for the \r\ncountry’s prospects for development, along with its \r\nsecurity and stability, is not borne out. We consider \r\nthe 30 September signing of the bilateral security \r\nagreement between Afghanistan and the United States \r\nand the accord with NATO on the status of forces to \r\nbe the sovereign right of the Afghan Republic, which \r\nmust in no way be disputed. It is our hope that those \r\ndocuments will help strengthen security in the country. \r\nWe note, moreover, that the new mission, which has been \r\nagreed with the Afghan leadership and strengthened by \r\nthe corresponding resolution of the Security Council, \r\nwill become an integral part of the framework of \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nWe are very concerned by the situation in the area \r\nof security and view with alarm the trend involving \r\nincreasingly terrorist, extremist and other radical \r\nelements that are striving to broaden their spheres of \r\ninfluence, not only through far-reaching operations but \r\nalso through contemptible terrorist attacks, which we \r\ndecisively condemn. Further grounds for concern is the \r\ninformation on the establishment of contacts between \r\nthe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the Afghan \r\narmed opposition, aimed, inter alia, at joint acts of \r\nsabotage in the north of Afghanistan.\r\nIn realistically assessing the situation, the CSTO \r\nis taking measures to strengthen its own capacity \r\nfor collective reaction to the threats and challenges \r\nemanating from Afghanistan. We intend to counter the \r\ndangers stemming from the infiltration of destabilizing \r\nelements into Central Asia, the spread of fundamentalist \r\nideas and the recruitment of foreign terrorist fighters. \r\nRadicals from groups affiliated with Al-Qaida have \r\nnoticeably stepped up their activities along the borders \r\nof the Afghan Republic with the neighbouring countries \r\nof Central Asia. Increased instability in Asia and the \r\nMiddle East makes the problem of foreign terrorist \r\nfighters all the more urgent.\r\nIn the context of the Afghan situation, the question \r\nof achieving intra-Afghan reconciliation also takes \r\non increased importance. The member States of the \r\nCSTO support the efforts of the Afghan leadership \r\nin that regard. In that context, we hope that the new \r\n14-64064 7/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nAfghan authorities will proceed with redoubled energy \r\nto advance that key aspect of the normalization of the \r\nsituation in the country. Naturally, that can happen \r\nonly with Kabul playing the leading role and on the \r\nbasis of the well-known triad of principles, namely \r\nthat the terrorists lay down their arms, recognize the \r\nConstitution of Afghanistan and completely sever their \r\nties with Al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations, in \r\nstrict compliance with the relevant Security Council \r\nsanctions regime. The CSTO States are prepared \r\nto strengthen their cooperation, both within their \r\norganization and with foreign partners, in particular \r\nwith the Afghan authorities, with a view to curtailing \r\nfurther threats throughout our region.\r\nThe countries of the CSTO express serious concern \r\nwith respect to the sharp increase in the narco-business \r\nin Afghanistan. Since the June meeting of the Security \r\nCouncil on Afghanistan, CSTO member States have had \r\na unified position on that score. The agreed approaches \r\nconcerning the narco-threat, in particular with regard \r\nto Afghanistan, are contained in the CSTO’s draft \r\nanti-narcotics strategy for 2014-2020. We must point \r\nout that, in spite of the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity and local authorities, Afghan drug cartels \r\ncontinue to increase production, and that is a challenge \r\nthat can be considered a threat to international peace \r\nand security. Without tough measures to get rid of the \r\ncrops and the laboratories, it will not be possible to \r\nreverse current trends and achieve a positive result. The \r\ninternational community and the Afghan Government \r\nhave the shared responsibility to curb the illicit \r\nproduction of and trafficking in drugs.\r\nWe note the courageous efforts and partial success \r\nof the Afghan security forces and law-enforcement \r\nbodies in curbing the narco-business. We honour the \r\ndead and those wounded in that difficult and at times \r\nunfair fight. We believe that stopping the expansion of \r\ndrug trafficking is one of the measures that will ensure \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan and forms an integral part of \r\nour collective efforts to stand up to terrorist threats. For \r\nthat purpose, the CSTO States are prepared to continue \r\nto provide assistance aimed at strengthening the ability \r\nof the Afghan National Security Forces. Moreover, \r\nour organization already has significant experience \r\nin countering the illicit trafficking in Afghan opiates, \r\nincluding as part of Operation Canal, which in \r\nSeptember 2008 received the status of a permanent \r\nregional counter-narcotics operation.\r\nThe mechanisms to counter smuggling have been \r\nfunctioning on the northern routes from Afghanistan \r\ninto Europe. The practical challenges involved in \r\nblocking the channels used in smuggling narcotics \r\nfrom Afghanistan, as well as in curbing the work of \r\ntransnational drug traffickers using the territory of the \r\nStates of Central Asia for smuggling of Afghan drugs \r\nhave been handled this past year as part of the special \r\nCanal-Southern Rim and Canal-Valley operations, \r\nthanks to which we removed 17.5 tons of hard drugs and \r\npsychotropic substances from circulation. In addition, \r\n5,300 crimes were identified and 25,200 criminal cases \r\nopened. We welcome the participation of the Afghan \r\nNational Security Forces as observers in those special \r\noperations. We call on NATO and the contingent of \r\nforces in Afghanistan to become really involved in the \r\nfight against illegal production and illicit drugs.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize the \r\nwillingness of our countries to actively participate in \r\nlarge regional projects aimed at ensuring sustainable \r\neconomic development in Central Asia and Afghanistan. \r\nIn particular, that involves implementing the Central \r\nAsia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade \r\nProject and building the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\r\nTajikistan railway. We are also prepared to look at the \r\npossibility of providing assistance to create conditions \r\nenabling the successful implementation of the \r\nTurkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline \r\nsystem and the construction of railway lines and roads \r\nfor automobiles. It is important to step up cooperation \r\nwith the regional organizations and mechanisms \r\ninvolved in those projects.\r\nWe express the hope that the new leadership of \r\nAfghanistan will get down to the business of building \r\nan independent, self-sufficient, democratic and neutral \r\ndynamically developing State, one effectively fighting \r\nterrorism and narcotics. For our part, the CSTO \r\ncountries are prepared to use all the capabilities that we \r\nhave and to do everything we can to help, working both \r\nbilaterally and on a multilateral basis in various arenas \r\nto deal with those challenges.\r\nMr. Masood Khan (Pakistan): Afghanistan is on \r\nthe cusp of a historic change. In that context, today’s \r\ndebate and this year’s draft resolution on Afghanistan \r\n(A/69/L.20) are most timely. Pakistan appreciates the \r\nfacilitation of the draft resolution on Afghanistan by \r\nGermany. Pakistan is a sponsor of the draft resolution.\r\n8/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nWe wish to pay tribute to the outgoing Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General on \r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Ján Kubiš, who did an outstanding \r\njob as a leader, as a mediator and as a conciliator. His \r\nbenign presence and wise counsel in Afghanistan \r\nraised the stature of the United Nations and helped that \r\ncountry move towards democratic transition, peace and \r\nstability. We also wish to thank him for working very \r\nclosely with the leadership of Pakistan. We wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Nicholas Haysom on his appointment \r\nas the new Special Representative, and we look forward \r\nto working with him. I also wish to thank Ambassador \r\nZahir Tanin of Afghanistan for his very positive, \r\nconstructive and forward-looking statement today.\r\nWe congratulate the people of Afghanistan on \r\nthe elections and the peaceful democratic transition. \r\nThat was a historic first. Pakistan supported the \r\nelectoral process in Afghanistan by strengthening \r\nsecurity along the border with Afghanistan. Pakistan’s \r\nrelationship with the new Government of national unity \r\nin Afghanistan has started on a high note. President \r\nMamnoon Hussain attended the inauguration of \r\nPresident Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. Mr. Sartaj Aziz, \r\nAdviser on National Security and Foreign Affairs, \r\nvisited Kabul to set the tone for a comprehensive and \r\nenduring partnership. President Ghani’s visit last \r\nweek to Islamabad marked a holistic renewal of our \r\nrelationship. I agree with Ambassador Tanin that the \r\nvisit generated an unprecedented surge of optimism. A \r\npeaceful, stable, united and prosperous Afghanistan is \r\nin Pakistan’s vital interest. Our nations are joined by \r\nthe bonds of common faith, kinship and history.\r\nPrime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif outlined \r\nhis vision of a multi-tiered bilateral engagement on \r\nthe political, security, economic and cultural levels. \r\nPakistan and Afghanistan have resolved to forge robust \r\neconomic partnerships by expanding trade, promoting \r\ninvestment, improving infrastructure, building road \r\nand rail links and generating energy. We also envisage \r\ncollaboration with Afghanistan on reconstruction, \r\nborder security and defence, capacity-building, \r\neducation and parliamentary exchanges. We envision a \r\npeaceful neighbourhood, connected by trans-regional \r\ninitiatives like the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity \r\nTransmission and Trade Project and the Turkmenistan-\r\nAfghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline. I have shared \r\ndetails on the recent engagement between Pakistan and \r\nAfghanistan in order to reassure the Secretary-General \r\nthat our two countries are, in his words, “resetting” our \r\nrelationship and increasing the space for cooperation \r\nin all areas, particularly in the areas of security and \r\ncounter-terrorism, which includes the activation of \r\ninteraction on the military and intelligence tracks.\r\nThe focus is now rightly shifting to a managed \r\nsecurity transition in Afghanistan so as to pave the \r\nway for internal stability and economic development. \r\nThe past mistakes of abandoning Afghanistan should \r\nnot be repeated. We welcome Afghanistan’s bilateral \r\nsecurity agreement with the United States and the \r\nstatus-of-forces agreement with NATO. We agree with \r\nthe Secretary-General that Afghanistan’s security \r\ninstitutions will require substantial assistance for years \r\nto come. In that context, sustaining the Afghan forces is \r\nimportant. The Secretary-General has highlighted the \r\nplight of civilians who are caught in the crossfire, with \r\nan increased number of deaths and injuries.\r\nIn the post-2014 period, domestic and international \r\nterrorist networks, insurgents and criminal groups \r\nshould not be allowed to push Afghanistan towards \r\ndeeper internecine strife. Intra-Afghan reconciliation \r\nremains the keystone for creating the conditions needed \r\nfor sustainable peace and stability in Afghanistan. An \r\ninclusive, Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation \r\nprocess, which the new Government is initiating, is \r\nimperative for national unity and progress. Pakistan \r\nstands ready to support that process.\r\nPakistan and Afghanistan both face the threats \r\nof terrorism, violent extremism and transnational \r\ncrime, and a precarious security environment. We will \r\ncounter those threats with a strong common resolve \r\nand coordinated endeavours. Non-State actors should \r\nnot be allowed to dictate Pakistan-Afghanistan bilateral \r\nrelations. Our relationship must be based on mutual \r\nrespect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and \r\nmarked by trust and cooperation. On our side, we are \r\nprosecuting Operation Zarb-e-Azb to take out terrorists \r\nand take down their networks. There is zero tolerance \r\nfor them. Our nation and our valiant armed forces are \r\ndetermined to fight that war to the finish.\r\nThere are no bad or good terrorists. Terrorists \r\nare criminals, plain and simple. Action is being taken \r\nagainst them, without distinction and differentiation. \r\nThe soil of Pakistan will be cleansed of the scourges \r\nof terrorism and violent extremism. Action on the other \r\nside of the border would help to ensure the annihilation \r\nof the toxic ideology of terrorism and the operatives who \r\nimplement its dark agenda. In that regard, we appreciate \r\n14-64064 9/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nthe steps being taken by the Afghan Government for \r\nsimultaneous operations on the Afghan side of the \r\nborder to address specific security situations.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s latest report on Afghanistan \r\n(A/69/540) expresses grave concern at the economic \r\nsituation, especially a precipitous drop in growth and \r\na decline in investor confidence. We hope that the \r\npledges made under the Tokyo Mutual Assistance \r\nFramework will materialize in order stimulate growth \r\nat the local, regional and national levels. That is critical \r\nfor continued stability in Afghanistan. We look forward \r\nto continued international commitments to Afghanistan \r\nat the London Conference next month. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report also refers to the booming illicit \r\neconomy in Afghanistan, which is both a symptom and \r\na source of uncertainty. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity will assist the Government of Afghanistan \r\nand other regional countries to counter the narcotics \r\ntrade and promote development priorities to strengthen \r\nits licit economy.\r\nWe are encouraged by President Ghani’s decision \r\nto give priority to refugees. More than 3 million \r\ndocumented and undocumented refugees continue to \r\nlive on Pakistan’s soil, while the international assistance \r\nfor them has been dwindling over the years. We are \r\nhosting the largest, single-country, chronic refugee \r\ncaseload. Despite constraints on Pakistan’s resources, \r\nwe have extended the refugees’ stay in Pakistan until \r\nthe end of 2015. Three steps are necessary to deal \r\nwith the refugees in Pakistan: first, the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees must \r\nincrease its assistance; secondly, the international donor \r\ncommunity, which seeks to help the new Government \r\nrebuild and reconstruct Afghanistan, should earmark \r\nresources for the rehabilitation and repatriation of \r\nrefugees; and thirdly, the Afghan Government itself \r\nshould, in its planning, pay special attention to the \r\nlivelihoods and housing of returning refugees so that \r\nthey can be reabsorbed in Afghanistan.\r\nWe are committed to regional stability through \r\ncooperation and connectivity. We commend China for \r\nthe successful meeting of last month’s Heart of Asia \r\nprocess. Pakistan will have the pleasure of hosting the \r\nnext meeting in 2015. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif \r\nconveyed to President Ashraf Ghani last week that \r\nPakistan would stand by Afghanistan to support its \r\nendeavours for peace and progress as it begins its decade \r\nof transformation. In 1930, Pakistan’s philosopher-\r\npoet Allama Iqbal characterized Afghanistan as \r\nQalb-e-Asia, or the “Heart of Asia”. He wrote, and I \r\ntranslate:\r\n“Asia is comparable to a living body. The heart \r\nthat beats inside the body is the homeland of the \r\nAfghans. The destruction of Afghanistan would \r\nbe the destruction of Asia. In its progress and \r\nprosperity lies the well-being of Asia”.\r\nMore than eight decades later, those verses still \r\nhold true. The people of Afghanistan are masters of \r\ntheir own destiny. Today, they are defining it for a \r\nbright future. We wish them and their new Government \r\nall success.\r\nMr. Al Musharakh (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): The United Arab Emirates reiterates its \r\nfull support for the draft resolution before the General \r\nAssembly today on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/69/L.20), and reaffirms its sponsorship of the draft \r\nresolution. The United Arab Emirates recognizes the \r\nimportance of joining efforts to support the Republic \r\nof Afghanistan and its people along a prosperous and \r\nstable path that will eventually lead to sustainable \r\neconomic development and to all-inclusive and effective \r\nsocial progress for all members of Afghan society. \r\nWe also welcome the new President of Afghanistan, \r\nMr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai. We wish him success in \r\nhis presidency.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates stresses the importance \r\nof the international community’s continued support \r\nfor Afghanistan as it assumes responsibility for its \r\nshare of the outcomes of the various international \r\nconferences, including the Kabul, Bonn, Tokyo, \r\nIstanbul, Lisbon and Chicago Conferences. We also \r\nlook forward to the London Conference to be held next \r\nmonth on the recovery of the Afghan economy. We \r\nreaffirm our commitment to supporting Afghanistan, \r\nwhich translates into stability for the region as a whole, \r\nincluding for the United Arab Emirates itself.\r\nMy country commends the recent political progress \r\nand the electoral experience in Afghanistan. We also \r\ncommend the role of the Secretary-General and his \r\nSpecial Representative for Afghanistan and Head of \r\nthe United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan \r\nin supporting an Afghan-led political process. We \r\nreaffirm the importance of supporting the Afghan-led \r\npolitical process and the Afghani forces as they take over \r\nsecurity responsibilities, by providing training, funding \r\nand necessary support. The security and stability of \r\nAfghanistan are of vital importance in ensuring that \r\n10/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\ncountry’s economic recovery and development. We \r\nalso stress the importance of the national reconciliation \r\nprocess, which will bring together all elements of \r\nAfghan society, including women, in order to hold a \r\npeaceful dialogue.\r\nOn the humanitarian and development fronts, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates has continued to implement \r\nprojects in Afghanistan through a committee that works \r\nto coordinate the efforts of all United Arab Emirates \r\ndonors and charity institutions within a framework \r\ndesigned to help to meet the Afghan people’s basic \r\nneeds in areas such as nutrition, health care, assistance \r\nto orphans and people with special needs. We have also \r\ncontinued to implement various infrastructure projects, \r\nsuch as roads, schools and mosques, throughout \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates also continues to \r\nassist the Afghan people, through cooperation with \r\nvarious other States and institutions, in implementing \r\nprojects with long-term benefits aimed at improving \r\nAfghanistan’s economy and enhancing its workforce. \r\nIn a unique project, we launched the Fatima bint \r\nMohammed initiative for producing carpets in \r\nAfghanistan, an industry whose production had shrunk \r\nbut, since the launch of the initiative, now accounts \r\nfor 20 per cent of the country’s gross domestic \r\ngrowth, providing job opportunities for more than \r\n4,000 people, 70 per cent of them women, furnishing \r\na daily income that meets Afghan families’ needs and \r\nexceeds Afghanistan’s average per capita income. The \r\nproject is now opening the door to global markets for \r\nthe carpet industry, as part of the implementation of \r\nthe sustainable development plan of the United Arab \r\nEmirates, which includes combating unemployment \r\nin rural Afghanistan. The United Arab Emirates \r\nhas also implemented health projects, such as a joint \r\nventure with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for \r\nvaccinating children in Afghanistan, to which we have \r\nallocated $33 million, as well as contributing to global \r\nefforts to eradicate polio by 2018.\r\nAfghanistan has long been a victim of terrorism and \r\nextremism. In that regard, the United Arab Emirates \r\nstresses the importance of redoubling international \r\nefforts to combat terrorism and extremism, which \r\nhave a direct negative impact on the development of \r\nsocieties. We have consistently pursued a policy that \r\nincludes coordinated efforts to strengthen our national \r\nlegislation, laws and regulations, including establishing \r\na list of designated terrorist organizations, such as \r\nAl-Qaida, based on the provisions of our 2014 Federal \r\nAct Number 7 on countering terrorist activities. In that \r\ncontext, we will continue to work with other partners \r\nin the framework of our membership in the Global \r\nCounterterrorism Forum and our hosting of the the \r\nHedayah Centre in Abu Dhabi, the first international \r\ncentre of excellence aimed at countering extremism and \r\nterrorism.\r\nWe have also consistently raised awareness about \r\nmoderation in Islam by training Afghan imams, a \r\nprogramme — to which we have allocated to 44 million \r\nemirati dirhams — consisting of two phases, the first \r\nof which has successfully trained 11,000 mullahs, \r\nwhile the second, to be completed in 2015, aims to \r\ntrain another 20,000, 1,500 of whom will be women. \r\nMoreover, several hundred of those trainees will be \r\nqualified to train other participants, which itself will \r\nmake an effective contribution to creating a moderate \r\nand sustained environment in Afghanistan for decades \r\nto come.\r\nIn conclusion, we emphasize the readiness of \r\nthe United Arab Emirates to provide the required \r\nsupport for the Afghan people, and we look forward \r\nto continuing dialogue and discussions between our \r\ntwo countries designed to enhance cooperation and \r\ncoordination on security and development.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nwelcomes the report submitted to the General Assembly \r\nby the Secretary-General on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/69/540) and supports the Assembly’s adoption today \r\nof draft resolution A/69/L.20, on Afghanistan.\r\nAfter several decades of war and turmoil, the \r\nAfghan people have entered a crucial, three-pronged \r\nphase of transformation in the political, economic \r\nand security areas, with new opportunities to achieve \r\nunity, stability, peace and reconstruction, while at the \r\nsame time tackling difficult tasks. The Afghan people \r\naspire to unity, stable growth and peace with their \r\nneighbours, all of which are in the collective interests of \r\nthe international community, and it is our unshirkable \r\nresponsibility to help to resolve Afghanistan’s problems \r\nas soon as possible. China supports a continued leading \r\nrole for the United Nations in coordinating international \r\nassistance to Afghanistan in order to ensure that all \r\nstakeholders’ efforts are complementary, mutually \r\nreinforcing and synergetic.\r\nI would like to emphasize the following points. \r\nFirst, we must respect the Afghan people’s right to make \r\n14-64064 11/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nindependent choices. The country has a unique history \r\nand specific national conditions, and it is up to the \r\nAfghan people to independently explore the road that \r\nlies ahead of them, taking their current circumstances \r\ninto account. During President Ghani Ahmadzai’s recent \r\nvisit to China at the invitation of President Xi Jinping, \r\nboth sides issued a joint communiqué on deepening \r\ntheir strategic cooperation partnership. China would \r\nlike to reiterate its support for Afghanistan’s position \r\non maintaining its national independence, sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity, fully reflecting the Chinese \r\npeople’s respect for the Afghan people’s right to decide \r\nfor themselves. At the opening ceremony of the fourth \r\nMinisterial Meeting of the Istanbul Process, China’s \r\nPremier, Li Keqiang, also emphasized that China \r\nbelieves that the Afghan people have the capability and \r\nwisdom to enable them to handle their own affairs and \r\nultimately achieve peace and stability.\r\nSecondly, we must make every effort to promote \r\nthe process of peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. \r\nIn order to achieve peace and stability, it is vital that the \r\ncountry establish a broad political base and inclusive \r\npolitical reconciliation. As President Xi Jinping pointed \r\nout during his meeting with President Ghani, all sides \r\nshould support an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace \r\nand reconciliation process. China hopes that every party \r\nin Afghanistan will participate in that process and that \r\nthe international community will provide constructive \r\nassistance for it.\r\nThirdly, we must support Afghanistan in its efforts \r\nto achieve national security and stability. Afghanistan’s \r\ncurrent security situation is still troubled. The \r\ninternational community must back the country’s \r\nefforts to increase the capability of its security and \r\npolice forces in addressing threats of all kinds so that it \r\ncan rehabilitate itself and rebuild.\r\nFourthly, we should help Afghanistan to speed \r\nup its national social and economic development. \r\nPoverty and backwardness provide a breeding ground \r\nfor extremism. We must therefore help Afghanistan \r\nto develop its economy so that the Afghan people can \r\nlive happy lives. The international community should \r\nhonour its aid commitment to help Afghanistan achieve \r\nsustainable economic development.\r\nFifthly, we should support Afghanistan’s \r\nintegration into regional cooperation. Afghanistan \r\ncannot achieve development and prosperity without the \r\nsupport and assistance of the international community, \r\nespecially the countries in the region. The international \r\ncommunity should support Afghanistan’s development \r\nof its foreign relations, especially with regard to \r\nenhancing the mutual trust and cooperation in various \r\nareas with the countries in the region, based on mutual \r\nrespect and benefits, so that it can better engage in \r\nregional economic cooperation and achieve common \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Chinese Government has long supported and \r\npromoted peace and reconstruction in Afghanistan. \r\nChina will resolutely pursue a policy of friendship \r\nwith that country and continuously move its strategic \r\npartnership ahead. China will continue to help \r\nAfghanistan in its capacity-building and enhance \r\nits cooperation with that country in such fields as \r\ninfrastructure, agriculture, hydropower and the \r\nexploitation of mineral resources. We also plan to offer \r\nmore training and assistance in education, security and \r\nother fields.\r\nNot long ago, the Chinese Government hosted in \r\nBeijing the fourth Ministerial Conference of the Istanbul \r\nProcess on the question of Afghanistan, which has \r\nplayed a positive role in advancing the Istanbul Process \r\nand in facilitating the early resolution of Afghan issues \r\nand the achievement of lasting peace, stability and the \r\neconomic and social development of the region. China \r\nwill continue to lend its full support to Afghanistan in \r\nits efforts to improve its relations with its neighbours, \r\nenhance regional security and facilitate its engagement \r\nin regional cooperation. We welcome the participation \r\nof Afghanistan in building the Silk Road Economic \r\nBelt. \r\nAt a time when the Afghan people, who have suffered \r\na great deal from war, look ahead with aspiration and \r\nhope, nothing is more important and precious than \r\nthe understanding, support and help of the country’s \r\nneighbours and friends. China will continue to provide \r\nthe necessary assistance and support to Afghanistan, do \r\nwhat it can as a neighbour and assume the responsibilities \r\nof a big developing country. China will work with the \r\ninternational community and make unremitting efforts \r\nto help bring about sustained developmentand security \r\nand the prosperity of Afghanistan and the region.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): At the outset, let me \r\nthank the President for organizing this discussion \r\non the situation in Afghanistan. I would also like to \r\ncommend the German delegation for coordinating \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the issue in \r\nan excellent manner, which has led us to this annual \r\nGeneral Assembly draft resolution (A/69/L.20). India \r\n12/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nis happy to co-sponsor this draft resolution, as we have \r\ndone in the past several years, which is traditionally \r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nI wish to congratulate the people of Afghanistan \r\non their new Government of national unity, led by \r\nPresident Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Chief Executive \r\nOfficer Abdullah Abdullah.\r\nThe Afghan people have shown great patience and \r\nforbearance during the recent months. That gave much \r\nneeded political space and time to the two presidential \r\ncandidates and their supporters to work through the \r\nelements that have made the national unity Government \r\nagreement possible. That patience and forbearance is \r\nyet another testimony to the strong public support in \r\nAfghanistan for a democratic political system. It will \r\npreserve the gains in political reconstruction made \r\nover the past 13 years. It is also testimony to the \r\nfierce determination of the Afghan people to vanquish \r\nterrorism and extremism. We have no doubt that both \r\nPresident Ghani Ahmadzai and Chief Executive Officer \r\nAbdullah will keep that in mind as they undertake the \r\ndifficult tasks that lie ahead of them. They include \r\nthe rapid formation of a new Afghan Government in \r\nkeeping with the national unity Government agreement \r\nand also the task of electoral reforms and organizing \r\na constitutional Loya Jirga that they have set for \r\nthemselves.\r\nDespite the great efforts and sacrifices of both \r\ninternational troops and the personnel of the Afghan \r\nnational security forces, the evil scourge of terrorism \r\nand extremism has continued to threaten Afghanistan’s \r\npeace and stability. That such terrorist and extremists \r\ngroups continue to survive, despite the immense \r\nmilitary pressure brought on them, only underscores \r\nthe fact that they continue to benefit from support from \r\nbeyond Afghanistan, and they also access resources \r\nfrom transnational terrorist and criminal networks. \r\nIt is only if that support stops and the linkages with \r\nnetworks are broken that the scourge of terrorism will \r\nbe defeated.\r\nThe reconciliation of members of the erstwhile \r\nTaliban regime is an integral part of the efforts to achieve \r\nnational reconciliation that are being undertaken by \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan. A successful national \r\nreconciliation programme must be transparent, led by \r\nthe Afghan Government and owned by the Afghan \r\npeople, and it must respect the Afghan Constitution \r\nand the international red lines. That will require sincere \r\ncooperation on he part of all parties concerned.\r\nAfghanistan is also entering a new phase in its \r\neconomic transition. In today’s global economic \r\nsituation, when our Government budgets are strained \r\nand when the sentiment of aid fatigue exists in most \r\ntraditional donor countries, a successful Afghan \r\nprivate sector holds the key to a successful economic \r\ntransition in Afghanistan. As a lead country in the \r\nconfidence-building measures based on investment in \r\ntrade and commerce, which are being undertaken under \r\nthe Istanbul Process, India has gained some experience \r\non that issue. One of the consistent messages that we are \r\nreceiving from private-sector businesses serious about \r\nentering the Afghan market is that, while security is \r\nan issue that can at times be managed, Afghanistan’s \r\nlack of connectivity to seaports and to faster-growing \r\neconomic regions of Asia is a significant constraint. \r\nIndia has been in discussions with the Governments \r\nof Iran and Afghanistan to see how we can collaborate \r\non a project to develop Iran’s port of Chahbahar, which \r\nwould improve Afghanistan’s access to the sea and \r\nprovide a significant boost to economic reconstruction \r\nactivities in the western parts of Afghanistan. We hope \r\nthat other similar connectivity-enhancing projects for \r\nAfghanistan will be undertaken by the international \r\ncommunity and will henceforth be seen as a priority \r\narea in our collective efforts to assist Afghanistan’s \r\neconomic reconstruction programme. President Ghani \r\nAhmadzai has taken the lead in that respect, and his \r\nefforts need reciprocation in full measure.\r\nThis is a critical decade of transformation for \r\nAfghanistan. India is proud to call itself Afghanistan’s \r\nfirst strategic partner. We share the Afghan people’s \r\nvision of a strong, independent, united and prosperous \r\nAfghanistan, for which so many Afghans have \r\nsacrificed so much. India will do whatever is possible \r\nwithin our capacities and our means to work with the \r\nAfghan Government and its people to realize their \r\nvision. Afghanistan also needs the unwavering support \r\nof the international community.\r\nMs. King (Australia): Draft resolution A/69/L.20 \r\nappropriately recognizes the major milestones \r\nreached this year in Afghanistan. It also recognizes \r\nthe continuing security, economic and development \r\nchallenges, and the continuing vital importance of \r\neffective partnerships between Afghanistan and the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe September inauguration of President Ghani \r\nAhmadzai and the establishment of a Government \r\nof national unity with Mr. Abdullah Abdullah as \r\n14-64064 13/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nChief Executive Officer marked the first democratic \r\ntransfer of power in Afghanistan’s history. Australia \r\napplauds the millions of Afghans who demonstrated \r\ntheir dedication to a democratic future and who braved \r\na very real threat of violence to vote in two election \r\nrounds. That was a truly historic achievement. We \r\nurge President Ghani Ahmadzai and Chief Executive \r\nOfficer Mr. Abdullah to continue to work in a spirit \r\nof cooperation, as a stable, committed and inclusive \r\nGovernment is in the interests of all Afghan people and \r\nis essential to protect the gains of the past decade.\r\nThe Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) \r\nassumed the lead role for providing security over a year \r\nago now and is on track to assume full responsibility \r\nfor security by the end of 2014. The ANSF delivered \r\nsecurity for Afghanistan’s elections and now leads \r\n99 per cent of conventional and special operations. \r\nAn effective and sustainable ANSF is fundamental \r\nto Afghanistan’s long-term stability, but continued \r\nassistance will be required to build their capacity. \r\nThe NATO-led non-combat Resolute Support Mission \r\nwill continue to train, advise and assist those forces. \r\nAustralia will participate in Resolute Support and will \r\ncontribute $100 million a year from 2015 to 2017 to \r\nsustain the ANSF. We look to the Afghan Government \r\nto ensure that the support from the international \r\ncommunity is used effectively.\r\nAs Afghanistan moves towards greater self-\r\nreliance, economic growth must be a priority for the \r\nGovernment. Growth must be broad-based, the widening \r\ninequality should be addressed and women should \r\nbe empowered to participate fully in Afghanistan’s \r\neconomy. Importantly, economic growth will need \r\nto be underpinned by sound policies that facilitate \r\ncommerce and investment and a regulatory framework \r\nthat provides transparency and confidence. The new \r\nGovernment has already started to deliver on much \r\nneeded reforms. The reopening of the investigation into \r\nfraud committed by the Kabul Bank is an early and \r\nimportant demonstration of the new Administration’s \r\nstrong stance against corruption.\r\nAfghanistan has also come a long way on human \r\nrights. The Afghan Constitution now enshrines equal \r\nrights for men and women. Three million Afghan girls \r\nnow attend school, compared to virtually none in 2001. \r\nIn this year’s elections, millions of Afghan women \r\nexercised their right to vote, and many were nominated \r\nfor office. Australia welcomes the recent establishment \r\nof Afghanistan’s National Women’s Advisory Council. \r\nThat positive momentum must continue. We look to \r\nAfghanistan to ensure full implementation of the law \r\non the elimination of violence against women and \r\nto finalize and implement a national action plan on \r\nwomen, peace and security, so as to ensure that women \r\nhave a role in the peace and reconciliation process. \r\nAs a strong supporter of Afghanistan’s Independent \r\nHuman Rights Commission, we were pleased by recent \r\nnews that the Commission has retained its “A” status \r\nfollowing a review by the International Coordinating \r\nCommittee of National Institutions for the Promotion \r\nand Protection of Human Rights.\r\nSince the fall of the Taliban in 2001, much has \r\nbeen achieved by Afghanistan with the support of the \r\ninternational community. We look to Afghanistan to \r\ncontinue to build on its security, political and economic \r\ntransition achievements and to continue improvements \r\nin human rights. The international community remains \r\ncommitted to supporting Afghanistan in that endeavour. \r\nThe signing of the bilateral security agreement with the \r\nUnited States and the status-of-forces agreement with \r\nNATO provides the legal instruments that will allow \r\nthe Resolute Support Mission to continue supporting \r\nthe national security forces as they provide security to \r\nthe Afghan people. In addition, the upcoming London \r\nConference will provide an important forum to discuss \r\ncontinued development cooperation with Afghanistan \r\nwithin the Tokyo Mutual Accountability Framework. \r\nAlso, the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan has a strong mandate to continue providing \r\nsupport to Afghanistan.\r\nAfghanistan faces significant challenges on the \r\nroad to a more peaceful and secure future. Australia, \r\nalong with the international community, is committed \r\nto supporting Afghanistan. And we look to do that in \r\nclose partnership with a responsive, transparent and \r\naccountable Afghan Government. We express our \r\nthanks to Germany for coordinating the draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.20 on Afghanistan and to Ambassador Tanin \r\nfor his important contribution. With over 80 sponsors, \r\nincluding Australia, the draft resolution sends a \r\nstrong message of continuing international support \r\nfor Afghanistan. We look forward to its adoption by \r\nconsensus.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I should like to express my \r\nsincere appreciation to Ambassador Harald Braun of \r\nGermany and his colleagues for guiding consultations \r\non draft resolution A/69/L.20 on Afghanistan. I \r\nshould also like to thank Ambassador Zahir Tanin of \r\n14/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nAfghanistan for his comprehensive statement at the \r\nbeginning of this debate, as well as for his constructive \r\nengagement towards achieving consensus.\r\nAs a sponsor of the document, Japan is pleased \r\nto offer its support for the draft resolution at hand. \r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to pay \r\ntribute to the United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan (UNAMA) and, in particular, to its former \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for \r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Ján Kubiš, who led the Mission ably \r\nduring his tenure. In that connection, I wish to extend \r\nmy congratulations to Mr. Nicholas Haysom on his \r\nappointment as the new Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General and my countryman, Ambassador \r\nTadamichi Yamamoto, as the new Deputy Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General. Under the \r\nnew leadership, I expect that UNAMA will continue to \r\nplay a central role in supporting an Afghan-led political \r\nprocess and socioeconomic development.\r\nJapan welcomes the induction of Mr. Mohammad \r\nAshraf Ghani Ahmadzai as the new President of \r\nAfghanistan and Mr. Abdullah Abdullah as the new \r\nChief Executive Officer. They are assuming their new \r\nposts at a very crucial juncture. As the country embarks \r\non the transformation decade aimed at achieving peace \r\nand stability, supported by sustainable finances and \r\na viable economy, the new Government must tackle \r\nnumerous challenges. In that regard, I should like to \r\ntouch upon three points of particular importance, \r\nnamely, advancing the political process, improving \r\npublic order and safety, and finally, continuing efforts \r\nto achieve sustainable development.\r\nFirst, with regard to the political process, Japan \r\ncongratulates the Afghan people on their first \r\ndemocratic transition of power. The electoral process \r\nwas a testament to the political will and courage of \r\nmillions of Afghan men and women. We are pleased to \r\nhave supported that process through, among others, the \r\nprovision of polling materials and capacity-building for \r\nthe Independent Election Commission. Nevertheless, \r\nwe note with disappointment the numerous delays \r\nthat the presidential electoral process experienced. \r\nFurthermore, it is regrettable that more than 50 days \r\nafter the inauguration of the President, key Government \r\nposts have yet to be filled.\r\nWe call on the new leadership to form an inclusive \r\ncabinet without delay and to respond to the calls of the \r\nAfghan people to advance the political process. We look \r\nto the new Government to carry out its commitments on \r\nthe campaign against corruption and narcotics, as well \r\nas on political reform. We also hope to see advancement \r\nin the political reconciliation process with the Taliban. \r\nMoreover, in anticipation of future elections, such as \r\nthe Wolesi Jirga or the House of the People in 2015, \r\nlessons from past elections must be utilized to reinforce \r\nthe democratic process and make it more transparent.\r\nSecondly, I would like to address the issue of public \r\norder and safety. The conclusion of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force’s (ISAF) mission at the end \r\nof 2014 will mark a watershed in Afghanistan’s path \r\ntowards self-sufficiency. In that regard, we welcome \r\nAfghanistan’s recent signing of the bilateral security \r\nagreement with the United States and the status of forces \r\nagreement with NATO. We also highly commend the \r\ncourageous efforts of ISAF in having provided security \r\nassistance to Afghanistan since its inception in 2001.\r\nFurthermore, we welcome the fact that the NATO \r\nmission Resolute Support will continue to provide \r\nassistance for Afghan security forces and institutions \r\nbeyond 2014. Public order and safety constitute the \r\nfoundations of Afghanistan’s development process \r\nand the international community’s engagement in it. \r\nIn order to prevent the country from ever becoming a \r\nseedbed for terrorism again, it is imperative that the \r\ninternational community continue its engagement with \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nIn that regard, Japan has provided more than \r\n$1 billion to the Law and Order Trust Fund for \r\nAfghanistan, operated by the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme. For example, this month \r\nJapan is providing financial and technical assistance \r\nfor the training of approximately 200 female Afghan \r\npolice officers in Turkey. We expect our contribution to \r\nthe Fund to be utilized with appropriate oversight and \r\nto strengthen Afghan law enforcement capabilities.\r\nMy third point concerns the achievement of \r\nsustainable development. At the 2012 Tokyo Conference, \r\nAfghanistan and the international community \r\nestablished the Tokyo Mutual Accountability \r\nFramework, which reaffirms their partnership for \r\neconomic growth and development through a process \r\nof mutual accountability. At the London Conference on \r\nAfghanistan, to be held next month as a follow-up to \r\nthe Tokyo Conference, we look to Afghanistan to renew \r\nits commitments on governance and development. \r\nCorrespondingly, we look forward to the international \r\ncommunity manifesting its continued support for \r\nAfghanistan.\r\n14-64064 15/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nJapan is the second-largest aid donor to Afghanistan. \r\nIt has contributed approximately $5.4 billion since \r\n2001 and has already disbursed over $2 billion of \r\nthe $3 billion commitment it made at the 2012 Tokyo \r\nConference. But that is also a commitment based \r\non mutual responsibility. With the understanding \r\nthat the new Afghan Government will deliver on its \r\ncommitments, Japan will continue to carry out the aid \r\ncommitments it made at the Tokyo Conference.\r\nJapan’s assistance to Afghanistan is a testament \r\nto our support for the people of Afghanistan on their \r\npath towards achieving sustainable development. As \r\nAfghanistan makes the crucial transition towards self-\r\nreliance, peace and prosperity, Japan stands ready to \r\noffer its support in cooperation with the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nMr. Oyarzun Marchesi (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, allow me to express my delegation’s \r\nappreciation to Ambassador Tanin and to align myself \r\nwith the statement made by the delegation of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nOver the past 13 years, the international community, \r\nin conjunction with Afghanistan, has undertaken a \r\nmassive economic and human effort. Progress has been \r\nremarkable. However, it remains fragile.\r\nOn the political front, the constant terrorist attacks \r\nand economic difficulties have not prevented a historic \r\npeaceful transfer of power. Spain welcomes the rapid \r\nfinalization of the bilateral security agreement between \r\nthe new Afghan Government and the United States \r\nand the status-of-forces agreement with NATO, which \r\nwill allow for support and advice to be provided to the \r\nAfghan forces.\r\nIn 2014, Afghanistan is completing the transition \r\nphase and beginning a decade of transformation. At \r\nits conclusion, the country should have its own solid \r\nand effective mechanisms to ensure comprehensive \r\nsecurity. The core of the decade of transformation \r\nis the international community’s partnership with \r\nAfghanistan, which, from this point on, will be deployed \r\non the basis of the commitments declared at the recent \r\nWales Summit and the Bonn and Tokyo Conferences, \r\nthe conclusions of which, we hope, will be confirmed \r\nat the upcoming London Conference to be held on 3 and \r\n4 December.\r\nIn that context, Spain wishes to emphasize in \r\nparticular the need to ensure progress in the area of \r\nwomen’s rights, which are enshrined in the Constitution \r\nof Afghanistan. I wish to congratulate the Afghan \r\nGovernment on the adoption of the National Action \r\nPlan on Women and Peace and Security in Afghanistan \r\nin October 2014. We encourage Afghanistan to work \r\ntirelessly in the new phase that is just beginning towards \r\na future in which women achieve full participation in \r\nall areas of political, economic, social and cultural life \r\nin Afghanistan, on an entirely equal footing with men.\r\nThe progress made over the past 13 years could also \r\nbe compromised by economic problems. We therefore \r\nwelcome the determination that has been expressed \r\nrepeatedly by Afghanistan’s new Government of \r\nnational unity to undertake the necessary reforms \r\nas soon as possible and to fulfil the commitments \r\nundertaken in those areas. We also encourage the \r\nefforts by the Government towards a deep and lasting \r\nreconciliation within Afghan society. Without full \r\nreconciliation, there is no hope for the future of \r\nAfghan — or any other — society.\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating Spain’s firm \r\ncommitment to the stabilization and transformation \r\nof Afghanistan, the country’s long-term progress \r\nand the construction of a peaceful, democratic and \r\nprosperous society for all Afghans. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the general support once again for this \r\nyear’s draft resolution (A/69/L.20), which Spain once \r\nagain sponsored and which we will adopt today. The \r\ndraft resolution is a key document on the international \r\ncommitment to Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my delegation’s thanks \r\nand appreciation to the President of the General \r\nAssembly for organizing this meeting to discuss the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan. I would also like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his report (A/69/540).\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is indeed eager to see \r\na peaceful and prosperous Afghanistan as its neighbour. \r\nWe continue to do everything in our power to that end, \r\nsince security in Afghanistan directly and indirectly \r\naffects security in the region, including my country.\r\nWe commend the Afghan people for their broad-\r\nbased participation in the presidential election despite \r\nthe threats by extremist and terrorist groups. We also \r\nwelcome the formation of the Government of national \r\nunity, with Mr. Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai as its President \r\nand Mr. Abdullah Abdullah as its Chief Executive \r\nOfficer.\r\n16/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nWe trust that all political entities will work together \r\nin accordance with the Afghan Constitution and with \r\nthe aim of strengthening Afghanistan’s sovereignty, \r\nindependence, territorial integrity and national unity \r\nin order to achieve a peaceful and prosperous future \r\nfor the entire Afghan people. The new Government \r\nrepresents the true will of the Afghan people and should \r\nenjoy the due respect and support of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nOn the important question of security arrangements, \r\nall General Assembly resolutions concerning the \r\nsituation in Afghanistan, including today’s draft \r\nresolution (A/69/L.20), are emphatic that all measures \r\nto support the training, equipping, financing and \r\ndevelopment of the Afghan National Security Forces \r\nbeyond 2014, including the Resolute Support mission, \r\nshould be undertaken in consultation with and with \r\nthe consent of the Government of Afghanistan, which \r\nreflects the strong commitment of the international \r\ncommunity to respecting the sovereignty, independence, \r\nterritorial integrity and national unity of Afghanistan. \r\nWe continue to support Afghanistan and the Afghan \r\npeople. Iran has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for \r\nmore than three decades. The remaining Afghans in \r\nour contry use our Government-subsidized schools and \r\nhigher education, health and social security services. \r\nBased on the information provided by our Ministers \r\nof Education and Higher Education, in this year alone \r\nmore than 320,000 Afghan students were enrolled in \r\nour schools, and more than 7,000 in our universities. \r\nWe continue to expand our bilateral cooperation, \r\nparticularly on security matters and counter-narcotics \r\nefforts, while developing projects and economic \r\ncooperation in the fields of infrastructure, agriculture \r\nand finding durable solutions for Afghan refugees.\r\nThe continuing engagement among Afghanistan, \r\nits neighbours and its regional partners in the areas of \r\ntrade, economic exchanges and development projects \r\nmust be further supported and strengthened. We firmly \r\nbelieve that greater economic ties will bring about peace \r\nand reinforce security and stability in the country.\r\nOn counter-narcotics efforts, we are particularly \r\nconcerned about the reports indicating that opium \r\npoppy cultivation in Afghanistan has almost doubled \r\nsince 2012, which is a real threat for the region and \r\nbeyond and should be addressed by the Government \r\nof Afghanistan and the international community. We \r\nwelcome the initiative taken by the Afghan Minister \r\non Counter-Narcotics to organize a good-neighbourly \r\nrelations declaration conference in Kabul in January \r\n2014, with the participation of ministers or heads of \r\nanti-counter-narcotics institutions from China, Iran, \r\nPakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. \r\nWith the strong support and commitment of \r\ninternational donors, Afghan authorities and the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime, the menace of \r\ndrug cultivation and drug trafficking, a main source \r\nof income for extremist and terrorist groups, could \r\nbe curtailed to a great extent. In that regard, the \r\ninternational community should support the Triangular \r\nInitiative on counter-narcotics enforcement among \r\nAfghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, which is essential \r\nnot only to strengthening the security and stability of \r\nAfghanistan but also to alleviating the serious concerns \r\nof neighbouring States and the transit and destination \r\ncountries of drug trafficking.\r\nWe support the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan (UNAMA) and United Nations agencies \r\nin their efforts to provide development assistance for \r\nthe reconstruction of the country through a robust \r\nregional engagement on issues such as border security, \r\nimmigration, the return of refugees and drug control \r\nmeasures. The role of UNAMA should be further \r\nstrengthened in the light of the developments expected \r\nin Afghanistan this year. The future role of the United \r\nNations in Afghanistan is going to grow, due to the \r\nmultifaceted and increasingly complex challenges. We \r\ntherefore regret to learn about the reduction of resources \r\navailable to it.\r\nI would take this opportunity to express my \r\nappreciation to Mr. Ján Kubiš, former Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General and Head of \r\nUNAMA, for his dedication and outstanding service \r\nto Afghanistan. We wish him success and good luck \r\nin his future assignment. I also wish to welcome his \r\nsuccessor, Mr. Nicholas Haysom.\r\nIn conclusion, the Government of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran wishes to once again reiterate its \r\nsustained support for the promotion of security, \r\nstability and sustainable development in Afghanistan \r\nand extends our full support to the country’s new \r\nGovernment.\r\nMr. Pressman (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States is pleased to join other Member States \r\nin sponsoring the draft resolution on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan (A/69/L.20). The text renews the \r\ninternational community’s commitment to supporting \r\n14-64064 17/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nthe people and the Government of Afghanistan as they \r\nwork to expand security, freedom and prosperity in the \r\ncountry. \r\nThe year 2014 has already featured Afghanistan’s \r\nfirst democratic, peaceful transfer of power and the \r\nformation of a Government of national unity under \r\nPresident Ghani’s leadership. The determination of \r\nthe Afghan people showed in voting in such large \r\nnumbers despite security risks, and the two presidential \r\ncandidates’ choice of unity over division demonstrated \r\nthe depth of Afghans’ commitment to continuing their \r\ncountry’s democratic development and its progress \r\ntowards lasting stability. As the new Government \r\ntakes on formidable challenges, including preparing \r\nfor parliamentary elections, considering constitutional \r\nreform, combating corruption and illicit drug trafficking \r\nwhile developing the licit economy, it will continue to \r\nneed the strong support of the international community. \r\nBy adopting this draft resolution, the General \r\nAssembly will affirm its commitment to meeting that \r\nneed. It cannot and should not be forgotten that Afghans, \r\nwith the support of the international community, \r\ncontinue to develop their country under the constant \r\nthreat of attack by illegal armed groups whose attacks \r\non civilians demonstrate their sheer brutality. Afghan \r\nforces have performed courageously and every day are \r\ngrowing more capable of protecting the Afghan people \r\nfrom harm. \r\nThe United States and its partners remain \r\ncommitted to supporting their continued development \r\nafter the International Security Assistance Force \r\nconcludes its mission at the end of the year. In the near \r\nterm, NATO and its partners, at the invitation and in full \r\ncoordination with the Government of Afghanistan, will \r\ntrain, advise and assist Afghan forces with the ultimate \r\ngoal of developing professional, self-sustaining security \r\nforces capable of securing Afghanistan. \r\nAs important as security and political progress is, \r\nlasting stability in Afghanistan will not be possible \r\nwithout sustained socioeconomic development and \r\ngrowth. The Afghan Government must facilitate \r\ndevelopment by taking on corruption and doing so \r\nvigorously and upholding the rule of law so Afghans \r\nand their trading partners can engage in commerce in a \r\npredictable and fair legal environment. It is encouraging \r\nthat President Ghani has made combating corruption a \r\nclear priority for his Government from the outset. \r\nBut again, international support can play an \r\nimportant role in promoting development not only \r\nthrough the provision of development assistance, but \r\nalso through efforts, particularly by Afghanistan’s \r\nneighbours, to integrate Afghanistan into the regional \r\nand global economy. Events like the recently concluded \r\nHeart of Asia Ministerial Conference in China as well \r\nas the upcoming London Conference offer occasions for \r\nthe Government of Afghanistan and the international \r\ncommunity to focus on that critical ingredient for a \r\nstable Afghanistan. The United States encourages \r\nall participants to take maximum advantage of those \r\nopportunities. \r\nThe United Nations has been, and will continue to \r\nbe, an important focal point for international support for \r\nAfghanistan. The United Nations Assistance Mission in \r\nAfghanistan and other United Nations elements played \r\na critical and commendable role in this year’s election \r\naudit and will continue to be called upon for advice on \r\nelectoral and legal issues, inter alia. In those efforts, the \r\nUnited Nations will continue to enjoy the support and \r\nthe partnership of the United States of America as we \r\nwork with it and all of our partners to support Afghans’ \r\nefforts to transform their country. \r\nThe progress of the past decade has been real \r\nand tangible. Afghans have seen improved access to \r\neducation for all children, including girls. Fewer than \r\n1 million students were enrolled in school in 2001, none \r\nof them girls. Today more than 8.3 million students \r\nattend school, one third of whom are girls. In 2001 \r\nthere was virtually no independent Afghan media, only \r\nTaliban propaganda. Today Afghans can listen to 175 \r\nFM radio stations, watch 75 television channels and read \r\nhundreds of print publications. The progress we have \r\nwitnessed has changed people’s lives for the better and \r\noffers a sound foundation on which the Afghan people, \r\nwith international support, can — and will — build a \r\nbrighter future for their country.\r\nMs. Paik Ji-ah (Republic of Korea): The Republic \r\nof Korea welcomes the first democratic transition of \r\npower in Afghanistan’s history. We believe that the \r\nrecent inauguration of the new Afghan President, based \r\non the political agreement to form a Government of \r\nNational Unity, signals a new era of Afghan-led efforts \r\ntowards peace and prosperity.\r\nIn particular, we appreciate the courage and \r\ndetermination of the Afghan people, especially Afghan \r\nwomen, who actively participated in elections despite \r\n18/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nviolence threatened by the Taliban and other terrorist \r\ngroups. The support of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan and of global electoral observers \r\nduring the electoral process is also commendable.\r\nThe new Afghan Government faces a multitude of \r\nchallenges, including issues of security, governance \r\nand human rights. Given the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces’ assumption of full responsibility for \r\nsecurity and the International Security Assistance \r\nForce’s withdrawal at the end of this year, continuous \r\ninternational assistance is critical. In that regard, \r\nwe appreciate the International Security Assistance \r\nForce (ISAF) leaders’ Wales Summit declaration in \r\nSeptember, which envisages the establishment of the \r\nshort-term Resolute Support Mission to train, advise \r\nand assist the Afghan forces, and their commitment \r\nto continuously finance the Afghan National Security \r\nForces beyond 2014. We also welcome the conclusion \r\nof the bilateral security agreement between the United \r\nStates and Afghanistan and the status-of-forces \r\nagreement between NATO and Afghanistan.\r\nMy delegation recognizes that the transition \r\nrequires not only a process to improve the security \r\nsituation, but also the full assumption of Afghan \r\nleadership and ownership over governance. The decision \r\nof the international community to muster long-term \r\nsupport depends on the Afghan Government’s progress \r\nin key areas under the Tokyo Mutual Accountability \r\nFramework. The London Conference on Afghanistan \r\nin December will serve as an important opportunity \r\nto review the progress made and to reaffirm the \r\ninternational community’s commitments.\r\nThe Afghan Government must redouble its efforts \r\nin the promotion of human rights, especially those of \r\nwomen, as well as good governance, including its fight \r\nagainst corruption and the illicit economy. We call for \r\nthe full implementation of the law on the elimination of \r\nviolence against women and the anti-money-laundering \r\nlaw in that regard.\r\nEnhanced regional dialogue and confidence-building \r\nmeasures are also important to ensure lasting peace \r\nand security in Afghanistan. We note the fourth Heart \r\nof Asia Ministerial Conference, held in Beijing on \r\n31 October, and the Beijing declaration, which furthered \r\nthe Istanbul Process.\r\nNational reconciliation owned by Afghans and \r\nled by Afghans will be essential for lasting peace and \r\nsecurity in Afghanistan. We look forward to further \r\nprogress on political dialogue and peace negotiations \r\namong all the relevant stakeholders under a newly \r\nlaunched Afghan Government of unity.\r\nToday’s draft resolution (A/69/L.20), to be adopted \r\nby consensus, embodies the political will of all Member \r\nStates to support the Afghan people in their political \r\nand national reconstruction process. The Republic of \r\nKorea has actively taken part in the global contribution \r\nto reconstruction and stability in Afghanistan since \r\nit joined the ISAF contributing nations in 2010. As \r\npart of such efforts, our provincial reconstruction \r\nteam operated in Parwan province until June, with \r\na focus mainly on four key areas — medical and \r\nhealth, education, governance and rural development. \r\nMoreover, my Government has contributed $250 million \r\nin financial assistance to date, for both the sustainment \r\nof the Afghan National Security Forces and the \r\nsocioeconomic development of Afghanistan, since it \r\npledged in 2011 to provide $500 million to Afghanistan.\r\nWe will continue our support to Afghanistan, \r\nincluding financial contributions beyond 2014, so that \r\nthe Afghan Government and its people can achieve a \r\nprosperous, stable and democratic Afghanistan for all \r\nAfghans.\r\nMrs. Jakubonė (Lithuania): At the outset, allow \r\nme to thank Germany and other States for preparing \r\nthe draft resolution on the situation in Afghanistan \r\n(A/69/L.20). Lithuania looks forward to its adoption by \r\nconsensus.\r\nLithuania aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\non behalf of the European Union.\r\nThis year has presented a number of challenges \r\nfor the Afghan nation, which it has successfully met. \r\nThe presidential elections marked the first democratic \r\ntransition in the modern history of Afghanistan. \r\nMoreover, the elections took place at a time when \r\nthe Afghan National Security Forces assumed their \r\nresponsibilities for safeguarding the country. Although \r\nthe situation remains fragile, the successful completion \r\nof those processes proves the willingness and capability \r\nof Afghanistan to continue on its path towards creating \r\na stable, peaceful and prosperous country where every \r\nman, woman and child can feel safe and secure.\r\nAfghanistan now urgently needs a fully functioning \r\nGovernment of national unity that is able to implement \r\nthe necessary and pressing reforms. A particular focus \r\nneeds to be placed on improving the rule of law, dealing \r\nwith the security situation, protecting human rights, \r\n14-64064 19/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nfighting corruption and combating drug production \r\nand trafficking. Illicit opium production threatens the \r\nsecurity and development of the country and the whole \r\nregion, as the Afghanistan Opium Survey 2014 shows a \r\nworrying trend of increasing opium poppy cultivation. \r\nWe call on Afghanistan and the international community \r\nto intensify their joint efforts in supporting alternative \r\nlivelihoods and fighting organized crime.\r\nLithuania has been a firm partner of Afghanistan, \r\na supporter and contributor in achieving its main \r\ngoals. Our political and development cooperation, \r\nincluding support for institutional capacity-building, \r\ncivil society, economic growth and social development \r\nand promotion of regional initiatives, will continue, as \r\nstated at the Chicago Summit, the Tokyo Conference \r\nand other meetings.\r\nLithuania, which has undergone a radical \r\ntransformation over the past several decades, is \r\nready to share its experience in a number of areas \r\nof State-building, including strengthening regional \r\ncooperation. In our view, regional cooperation is of \r\ncrucial importance for strengthening stability and \r\nfacilitating the development of Afghanistan and the \r\nentire region. We support regional initiatives involving \r\nAfghanistan such as the Istanbul Process, the Regional \r\nEconomic Cooperation Conference and others. The \r\nfuture of Afghanistan also depends on the positive \r\nengagement of its neighbours.\r\nAs the International Security Assistance Force \r\nmission winds down, the sustained capacity-building \r\nof the Afghan National Security Forces is essential for \r\nthe maintenance of security and stability in the country. \r\nLithuania will continue supporting the Afghan National \r\nSecurity Forces with financial contributions as well as \r\nthrough participation in the Resolute Support Mission. \r\nThis non-combat mission, aimed at training, assisting \r\nand mentoring the Afghan National Security Forces, \r\nbuilds on the results achieved by the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force.\r\nThe invitation extended by Afghan Government \r\nto continue to train, advise and assist the Afghan \r\nNational Security Forces, and the signing of the United \r\nStates-Afghanistan bilateral security agreement and \r\nthe NATO-Afghanistan status-of-forces agreement \r\noffer a solid legal basis for the new mission. We urge \r\nAfghanistan to ratify both agreements so that future \r\nsecurity assistance can continue unhindered. Lithuania \r\nwould also welcome a Security Council resolution, \r\nwhich should be prepared in consultation with the \r\nAfghan Government.\r\nAnother area in which Lithuania contributes to \r\nthe efforts of Afghanistan’s Government is through \r\nits participation in the European Union Police Mission \r\nin Afghanistan (EUPOL). The decision to extend \r\nEUPOL’s mandate in Afghanistan until the end of 2016 \r\nis a welcome one. Lithuania is planning to continue \r\nits participation in this important Mission, which has \r\nprovided much-needed training for the Afghan civilian \r\npolice and support to the Afghan authorities at the \r\nstrategic level.\r\nThe presence of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has been of \r\ncrucial importance to the advancement of human \r\nrights, democratic processes and the country’s \r\noverall development, and as Afghanistan starts its \r\ntransformation decade, UNAMA’s role will become \r\nmore prominent and essential.\r\nI would now like to turn to the situation of Afghan \r\nwomen. Violence against women in Afghanistan \r\nremains underreported, especially in rural areas. We \r\ncall on the Afghan Government to step up efforts to \r\nfully implement the recommendations of the Committee \r\non the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, \r\nthe country’s law on eliminating violence against \r\nwomen and its recently adopted national action plan for \r\nwomen, peace and security. Involving women genuinely \r\nand meaningfully in the peace, reconciliation and \r\ndevelopment processes, ensuring the safety and dignity \r\nof women public servants and recruiting, training and \r\nretaining women for the Afghan National Security \r\nForces are all essential for the future Afghanistan. The \r\nprominent role that the First Lady of Afghanistan is \r\nwilling to take will, hopefully, produce positive results, \r\nincluding in engaging women and strengthening their \r\nrights. We hope this progressive momentum can be \r\nsustained. Afghanistan needs to find solutions suited \r\nto the Afghan way of life and yet able to improve the \r\nfemale population’s situation.\r\nIn conclusion, as Afghanistan enters its transformation \r\ndecade, the support of the international community \r\nand countries in the region will be essential. The \r\nNational Unity Government, the Afghan people and \r\nthe international community must work in unison for a \r\nbetter future for Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Kydyrov (Kyrgyzstan): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\n20/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nGeneral for his comprehensive report on the situation \r\nin Afghanistan (A/69/540), and to thank the Permanent \r\nMission of Germany for conducting consultations and \r\nintroducing today’s draft resolution (A/69/L.20).\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nearlier by the representative of the Russian Federation \r\non behalf of the States members of the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization. However, I would also \r\nlike to make a statement in my national capacity.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic supports the efforts of \r\nAfghanistan to establish peace and security in the \r\ncountry, build effectively functioning State institutions \r\nand develop its economy to further the prosperity of the \r\nAfghan people. We respect the Afghan people’s right \r\nto choose their own path to political development and \r\nemerge successfully from a transitional period. In that \r\nregard, we congratulate Afghanistan on its completion \r\nof elections and establishment of a Government of \r\nNational Unity. The peaceful and democratic transition \r\nof power from one President to the next creates a solid \r\nfoundation for the country’s peaceful and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn a message congratulating the new President of \r\nAfghanistan, Mr. Ashraf Ghani, President Almazbek \r\nAtambaev of the Kyrgyz Republic expressed his \r\nreadiness to further strengthen brotherly relations \r\nbetween Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan and the two \r\ncountries’ cooperation in areas of mutual interest. \r\nThe Kabul Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic, which \r\nofficially opened in February, is actively promoting \r\nthe development of bilateral relations and becoming an \r\nimportant link in the joint promotion and implementation \r\nof regional projects.\r\nWe are still seriously concerned about the \r\npersistently unstable security situation in Afghanistan. \r\nAs the Secretary-General points out in his report, \r\ninsurgent groups, international terrorists and associated \r\nnetworks took advantage of the prolonged political and \r\nelectoral crisis to mount major assaults around the \r\ncountry. Kyrgyzstan condemns the continued attacks \r\non innocent civilians, particularly women and children, \r\nand is of the view that the transfer of responsibility for \r\nsecurity should be gradual and orderly so as to ensure \r\nthe overall stability of the country and in the region as \r\na whole.\r\nAchieving full national reconciliation is one of \r\nthe main preconditions for ensuring lasting peace in \r\nAfghanistan. We support an Afghan-led and Afghan-\r\nowned inclusive peace and reconciliation process, \r\nwhich should be implemented by the Afghan people \r\nthemselves and in the interests of all Afghans. A \r\ncomprehensive peace process should be open to all \r\ninterested parties ready to reject violence, break off \r\nlinks with international terrorism and respect the \r\nConstitution of Afghanistan.\r\nAccording to the most recent report of the United \r\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime — the Afghanistan \r\nOpium Survey 2014 — the opium crop in Afghanistan \r\nwill hit a new high this year. It is a serious threat to the \r\nnational security both of Afghanistan and the countries \r\nof Eurasia. Despite the activities being conducted in \r\nthe framework of national and regional anti-narcotic \r\nstrategies and programmes, we have not fully stopped \r\nthe f low of drugs from Afghanistan via the so-called \r\nnorthern drug-trafficking route. The situation is \r\nworsened because revenues from illicit drug production \r\nand trafficking serve as a major funding source for \r\nterrorist and extremist groups. That in turn undermines \r\nthe security system both in the country and in the \r\nregion as a whole. We therefore call on our regional \r\npartners and the relevant United Nations bodies to step \r\nup further joint efforts to counter the illicit production \r\nand trafficking of drugs in and around Afghanistan.\r\nSustained and comprehensive economic development \r\nin Afghanistan is crucial not only to combating the \r\nchallenges the country faces today, but also to its \r\nachievement of long-term security and stability. In that \r\nregard, there is an urgent need to pay special attention \r\nto rebuilding Afghanistan’s economic infrastructure \r\nand to fully implement the considerable commitments \r\nto Afghanistan’s reconstruction and economic \r\ndevelopment that have been made at major international \r\nand regional conferences.\r\nWe believe that involving Afghanistan in regional \r\ncooperation and promoting its trade and economic \r\nrelations with neighbouring States will play a strong \r\npart in ensuring peace, stability, development and \r\ntrust in the region and beyond. As a participant \r\nin several regional organizations, Kyrgyzstan is \r\nready to contribute to that process. It is important \r\nthat Afghanistan be involved in regional economic \r\nintegration through the implementation of joint social, \r\neconomic and infrastructure projects. Kyrgyzstan \r\nfully supports measures aimed at promoting regional \r\neconomic cooperation by developing infrastructure in \r\nthe areas of energy, transport and communications. We \r\nare very interested in implementing projects exporting \r\n14-64064 21/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nenergy to Afghanistan through the framework of the \r\nCentral Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission \r\nand Trade Project and by establishing a tripartite \r\nagricultural consortium between Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan \r\nand Afghanistan, as well as by constructing railroads \r\nthat connect Afghanistan with its neighbours.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to reiterate \r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic’s principled position of respect \r\nfor the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of \r\nAfghanistan, and its readiness to assist Afghanistan \r\nin achieving lasting peace, sustainable security and \r\neconomic development.\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): The Maldives delegation \r\nwelcomes the comprehensive report submitted to the \r\nAssembly by the Secretary-General on the situation in \r\nAfghanistan (A/69/540).\r\nMy delegation follows the situation in Afghanistan \r\nwith much interest, and often with deep concern. For \r\na number of years, the country remained in a constant \r\nstate of civil war, with low productive capacity and \r\nfailed governance arrangements. In April, hope dawned \r\non Afghanistan — hope for a fresh start and progress \r\nfor the better. After remaining deadlocked for nearly \r\nfour months, the leaders of Afghanistan finally showed \r\nmaturity and reconciled the differences that had \r\nemerged after the presidential election. The Maldives \r\nwelcomes the efforts made by both parties that had \r\ncontested the election to reach a resolution and put \r\ntheir differences aside. We furthermore congratulate \r\nthe leadership for their willingness to put the interests \r\nof the Afghan people ahead of personal or political \r\nagendas and join hands in a unity Government. The \r\nsolidarity shown by both leaders is commendable and \r\ndemonstrates their commitment to take the country into \r\na new phase of prosperity and development.\r\nOur own experience with democratization is that \r\nthe hard work does not stop with elections. That is \r\njust one step. The real task involves cultivating norms \r\nand values that bolster democratization. It involves \r\nchanging people’s perceptions and way of thinking. \r\nInstitutions and systems need to develop slowly and, we \r\nardently believe, organically. We therefore call on the \r\ninternational community to allow Afghanistan the time \r\nand patience to find its own path towards democracy \r\nconsolidation.\r\nAs highlighted in the Secretary-General’s report, \r\ninsurgent groups and international terrorist networks \r\nare taking advantage of the country’s dire security \r\nsituation resulting from the protracted political and \r\nelectoral crisis. The Maldives welcomes the continuous \r\nefforts by Afghanistan to combat the insurgency and the \r\nterrorist activities. In particular, we note the enactment, \r\nin June, of two landmark statutes in Afghanistan to \r\ncombat money laundering and terrorist financing. We \r\nare also encouraged by the expansion of the security \r\ninitiative of the Afghan local police overseen by the \r\nMinistry of the Interior. Those developments give rise \r\nto hope for stability and security for the Afghan people.\r\nAs Afghanistan endures security challenges, \r\npolitical crises and economic hardship, those that suffer \r\nthe most are the vulnerable populations. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report highlights some of the key issues \r\nfaced by vulnerable populations, including women \r\nand children, and notes the Government’s actions in \r\naddressing those issues.\r\nThe Maldives welcomes the progress made in the \r\nimplementation of the 2011 action plan for preventing \r\nunderage recruitment, including age verification, \r\nscreening of new recruits and the training of Afghan \r\nsecurity forces in respect of children in armed conflict. \r\nMy delegation furthermore welcomes the continuing \r\nefforts by the international community, especially \r\nthe United Nations, in providing the Government of \r\nAfghanistan with technical support and advice on the \r\nelimination of violence against women.\r\nThe Maldives acknowledges the challenges faced \r\nby the Government of Afghanistan in addressing \r\nsome of those human rights issues and calls on all \r\nstakeholders — including the Government, private \r\ninstitutions and the international community — to \r\ncontinue increased efforts towards the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights in the country.\r\nThe Maldives believes that increased regional \r\nintegration is of the utmost importance and contributes \r\nto confidence-building, which in turn greatly benefits \r\nthe stability and prosperity of Afghanistan. In that \r\nregard, it is heartening to note that Afghanistan has \r\ncontinued to engage its neighbours in promoting \r\nregional cooperation. As a fellow member of the \r\nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, \r\nthe Maldives takes this opportunity to reinforce its \r\nbrotherly affection by calling upon all of our regional \r\nmembers to maintain their support and commitment to \r\nAfghanistan and embrace it in its quest for peace and \r\nprosperity.\r\n22/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nThe situation in Afghanistan cannot be resolved \r\nin isolation. Continued assistance and coordination on \r\nthe part of the international community and regional \r\ncollaboration are required to lift the country out of civil \r\nwar and strife and aid its transition to a new phase of \r\ndevelopment.\r\nDespite all of the hardships faced by the people of \r\nAfghanistan, the fact remains that they have persevered \r\nthrough difficult times with courage for over three \r\ndecades. Like many speakers before me, my delegation \r\ntoday reiterates the call on the international community \r\nto help the country through its transition for the sake of \r\nthe people of Afghanistan and the region.\r\nMr. Vencel (Slovakia): Slovakia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. I would also like to thank Ambassador Tanin \r\nfor his presence here and for his important statement.\r\nOur thanks also go to the German delegation \r\nfor its continued successful leadership during this \r\nyear’s negotiations on the important draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.20, which my country readily co-sponsored.\r\nRecently, the Security Council and the international \r\ncommunity hailed the Afghan people and authorities \r\nfor their tenacity in successfully completing a peaceful \r\nand democratic transfer of power this year and their \r\nvision for the future of the country. The conclusion \r\nof the Afghan presidential elections and subsequent \r\nmove to form a Government of national unity represent \r\nan unprecedented political transition. That spirit of \r\ncollaboration should remain part and parcel of the \r\neconomic and human development, ensuring the rule of \r\nlaw and peace and reconciliation efforts in the months \r\nand years ahead.\r\nThe political transition coincides with the country’s \r\nsecurity transition as Afghan forces take over full \r\nresponsibility from the international partners that \r\nare expected to end their missions in December. The \r\nchallenging period of ongoing parallel transitions in \r\nthe security, military and economic spheres, as well as \r\nthe political arena, will be critically important to the \r\ncountry’s future. The Security Council and the United \r\nNations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), \r\nin cooperation with the Afghan Government, must \r\ncontinue playing an important role in facilitating \r\na peaceful political transition in Afghanistan and \r\nensuring coherent approaches to equitable sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nSlovakia, based on its own history of transition, is \r\nfully aware of the fact that the transformation process \r\nis often found to be the opposite of easy. We would like \r\nto take this opportunity to assure Afghanistan and its \r\npeople of our long-term commitment to participate in the \r\ntransformation and consolidation efforts of the country \r\nalongside our partners in the international community. \r\nIn that regard, we anticipate close cooperation with the \r\nnew Afghan Government, with whom we are willing to \r\nshare our own transitional experience.\r\nReforms in Afghanistan are necessary. We therefore \r\nwelcome the adoption of the Afghanistan national \r\ndevelopment strategy and the ideas outlined by the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan in its strategy document \r\nentitled “Towards self-reliance: strategic vision for the \r\ntransformation decade”. Since public administration \r\nis key in that regard, we urge the Government of \r\nAfghanistan to continue to effectively reform the public \r\nadministration sector in order to implement the rule of \r\nlaw and ensure good governance and accountability.\r\nSlovakia welcomed the signing of the United \r\nStates-Afghanistan bilateral security agreement \r\nand the status-of-forces agreement between NATO \r\nand Afghanistan. The signing of those agreements \r\nrepresents an important step in the process of the \r\nongoing efforts towards stabilizing the security \r\nsituation in Afghanistan, which is a prerequisite for the \r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\nIn cooperation with its international partners, \r\nSlovakia is committed to further reinforcing security \r\nin the country and in the follow-up to the finalizing of \r\nthe International Security Assistance Force mission in \r\nAfghanistan in 2014. Slovakia is also ready to take part \r\nin the NATO Resolute Support mission to train, advise \r\nand assist as of 2015.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing our sincere \r\ngratitude also to the Secretary-General and his Special \r\nRepresentative for Afghanistan, Mr. Ján Kubiš, for their \r\ndedication and leadership. I would like to commend \r\nthe United Nations for its work in supervising the \r\nunprecedented election audit. I also wish to thank \r\nthe team of the Mission for their professional work \r\nin difficult conditions and to reiterate my country’s \r\nfull support for the irreplaceable role that UNAMA \r\nis playing. We wish the new Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General, Mr. Nicholas Haysom, every \r\nsuccess in his new appointment. We continue to offer \r\nhim our full support.\r\n14-64064 23/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nMr. Kassim (Malaysia): I wish to extend our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his latest \r\nreport on the situation in Afghanistan (A/69/540). My \r\ndelegation would like to highlight some perspectives on \r\nthe situation in Afghanistan that Malaysia considers to \r\nbe important.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that this meeting \r\nhas been convened in a timely manner. We welcome \r\nthe formation of the Government of national unity in \r\nAfghanistan, which is a positive step forward for its \r\npeople. We would also like to commend the United \r\nNations for the supervisory role it assumed in the second \r\nround of voting in the presidential elections in June. \r\nThrough that cooperation between the Government and \r\nthe United Nations, Afghanistan has embraced a new \r\nGovernment that is inclusive and representative of its \r\npeople.\r\nMalaysia is heartened by the courage and \r\ndetermination of the millions of Afghans who \r\nparticipated in the first and second rounds of voting. \r\nThe large turnout reflected the people’s aspirations \r\nto achieve a peaceful and democratic transition in \r\nleadership. In that regard, my delegation would like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate the people of \r\nAfghanistan as they embark on the journey whose first \r\nmilestone is the formation on 29 September of a national \r\nunity Government. Malaysia is confident that the new \r\nGovernment will bring about continued stability, \r\nprogress and development despite the many challenges \r\nit faces. We would encourage the new Government \r\nto continue to promote its ambitious transformation \r\ndecade programme for the period 2015 to 2024, with an \r\neye towards developing a new vision for the country’s \r\nfuture.\r\nMalaysia continues to monitor the security \r\ndevelopments in Afghanistan with strong interest. \r\nThe expected withdrawal of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force by the end of 2014 means \r\nthat the Afghan Unity Government will assume full \r\nresponsibility for the security and safety of its people \r\nand for its territorial integrity. Malaysia is concerned \r\nthat the country continues to face security challenges \r\nand to experience incidents of violence in the country. \r\nMalaysia condemns acts of violence in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations, including those acts.\r\nDespite the incidents of violence, Malaysia remains \r\nconfident that the Afghan National Security Forces \r\n(ANSF) will be able to shoulder the responsibility \r\nof protecting the people and maintaining security \r\nin the country. While the ANSF fulfils its primary \r\nresponsibility for security, it is imperative that the \r\ninternational community continue to provide the ANSF \r\nwith the support needed to ensure that its forces are \r\nequipped and trained to counter threats to security in \r\nthe country.\r\nThe work of the United Nations Assistance \r\nMission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), in cooperation \r\nwith the Government of Afghanistan, deserves to be \r\ncommended as well. UNAMA has been active in \r\nreinforcing sovereignty, leadership and ownership \r\nin the country. Its comprehensive approach has been \r\neffective in laying down the foundations for sustainable \r\ndevelopment in Afghanistan, while supporting \r\nconfidence-building measures within the framework of \r\nthe Afghan Constitution.\r\nOn another note, Malaysia has always been \r\nsupportive of stability and progress in Afghanistan. Our \r\ntrack record on that can be seen with the deployment \r\nof the medical contingent from the Malaysian Armed \r\nForces. Stationed in the Bamyan province, our forces \r\nwere active in providing much-needed medical services \r\nfrom July 2010 to April 2013.\r\nMalaysia’s assistance to Afghanistan does not stop \r\nthere. As a moderate and progressive Muslim nation, \r\nwe will continue to provide opportunities for capacity-\r\nbuilding and human resource development in the \r\ncountry. Through the Malaysian technical cooperation \r\nprogramme, we will continuously share our experiences \r\nin the fields of development and public administration \r\nas pillars of a developing nation. We strongly believe \r\nthat Afghanistan could benefit from the sharing of \r\nexperience and expertise that Malaysia has to offer.\r\nWe have seen a significant development in \r\nAfghanistan with the formation of a united Government. \r\nThe situation in Afghanistan is an opportunity for \r\nMember States to continue our support to that nation. Its \r\npeople have demonstrated the political will to embrace \r\na new era of democratic and inclusive governance. In \r\nthat regard, we must not turn our backs on them, but \r\ninstead lend them our helping hand.\r\nMalaysia is pleased to co-sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/69/L.20, on the situation in Afghanistan. We will \r\ncontinue to be a partner to Afghanistan in this moment \r\nof progress and development.\r\nMr. Çevik (Turkey): Turkey is pleased to co-sponsor \r\nthe draft resolution before us today (A/69/L.20), and we \r\nlook forward to its adoption by consensus.\r\n24/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nAfghanistan is going through a crucial phase \r\nin terms of its political, security and economic \r\ntransformation. The gains in the country in the past \r\n13 years, including in the fields of security, democracy, \r\ngovernance, capacity- and institution-building, \r\neconomic development and human rights, should be \r\ncommended. Nevertheless, those achievements have not \r\nyet reached a point of no return, and major challenges \r\nremain to be tackled. Therefore, the international \r\ncommunity’s continuing support is vital for a peaceful, \r\nsecure and stable Afghanistan to be able to effectively \r\nserve the needs of its people. With that understanding, \r\nthe comprehensive role assumed by the United \r\nNations and the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan in supporting the Afghan people will \r\ncontinue to be critical.\r\nWe welcome the successful continuation of the \r\npolitical transition process in Afghanistan. Indeed, the \r\nresults of the presidential elections were a success for \r\nall of the Afghan people, as it demonstrated their strong \r\nwill and courage to determine their own future. The \r\ndevelopments have also proved the professionalism of \r\nthe Afghan institutions that took part in the process. \r\nThe common will of the candidates running in the \r\nsecond round of the elections to establish a national \r\nunity Government independent of the election results is \r\nof particular importance, since it has clearly displayed \r\nthe Afghan people’s determination as a whole to \r\ncarry their country forward, as well as their belief \r\nin a common ideal. We believe that Afghanistan has \r\nemerged stronger from those experiences.\r\nWe welcome the fact that by the end of 2014 the \r\nAfghan National Security Forces will assume full \r\nsecurity responsibility for the Afghan people and \r\ntheir country. However, support for the continued \r\ndevelopment of the Afghan National Security Forces \r\nand institutions and wider cooperation with Afghanistan \r\nwill still be of paramount importance. The stability \r\nof Afghanistan, and subsequently that of the region, \r\nwill depend on improved security. The consequences \r\nof failure would be too immense for any of us to bear. \r\nTurkey remains committed to standing by the people of \r\nAfghanistan in this transition process, including in the \r\nfields of security and development.\r\nIn addition to Turkey’s financial commitments for \r\nthe funding of the Afghan National Security Forces, \r\nTurkey will also assume the framework nation role for \r\nKabul in the new mission that will be launched after the \r\nInternational Security Assistance Force is concluded by \r\nthe end of 2014. Turkey will also undertake responsibility \r\nfor Kabul International Airport. As may be recalled, \r\nMr. Ismail Aramaz, Ambassador of the Republic \r\nof Turkey to Afghanistan, was recently appointed \r\nas the next NATO senior civilian representative in \r\nAfghanistan.\r\nAt a critical juncture of political, security \r\nand economic transformation in Afghanistan, the \r\nimportance of regional cooperation and commitment is \r\nbecoming increasingly relevant to efforts to steer the \r\nregion towards becoming a zone of peace, stability and \r\nprosperity. The region has demonstrated on various \r\noccasions its readiness to resolve its own problems and \r\nto transform common problems into areas of mutual \r\nbenefit. We welcome all bilateral and multilateral \r\ndialogue and cooperation efforts to that end. With \r\nthat understanding, we also welcome the increased \r\nmomentum that has been achieved through the Istanbul \r\nProcess on Regional Security and Cooperation for a \r\nSecure and Stable Afghanistan thus far. The fourth \r\nMinisterial Conference of the Process, held in Beijing \r\non 31 October, once again demonstrated the importance \r\nof promoting regional cooperation.\r\nTurkey welcomes and encourages all efforts \r\nto enhance connectivity at the regional level. We \r\nbelieve that tangible projects emerging from increased \r\ncooperation will facilitate economic development, \r\nstability and self-sustainability in the region.\r\nA continued display of will by the international \r\ncommunity will strengthen the hopes of the Afghan \r\npeople for a bright future. Turkey will always remain \r\nin solidarity with the Afghan people and will continue \r\nto contribute to a secure, stable and prosperous \r\nAfghanistan, as we have done for so many years.\r\nMs. Freimane-Deksne (Latvia): Latvia aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (EU) and would like to make a few \r\nremarks in our national capacity.\r\nI would like to welcome the draft resolution to be \r\nadopted today (A/69/L.20), which Latvia sponsored, \r\nand to commend the efforts by Germany, Afghanistan \r\nand all partners that led to a successful outcome. I would \r\nalso like to thank Ambassador Tanin for his statement.\r\nFirst of all, Latvia welcomes the conclusion of \r\nAfghanistan’s presidential elections, the inauguration of \r\nthe new President of Afghanistan and the formation of a \r\nGovernment of national unity. The Afghan people have \r\ndemonstrated their clear desire for democracy. Now it \r\n14-64064 25/26\r\n20/11/2014 A/69/PV.57\r\nis up to all parties in Afghanistan to work together and \r\nto achieve a united, peaceful, secure and prosperous \r\nfuture for all its people. Afghanistan has achieved \r\nremarkable progress in the past decade. It is imperative \r\nthat that progress be sustained and that further reforms \r\nbe implemented. Sustained economic growth and a \r\nState-building process that is founded on the principles \r\nof good governance, the rule of law and human rights, \r\nespecially the rights of women and children, should \r\nbe the basis for a democratic, prosperous and stable \r\nAfghanistan. We welcome the upcoming London \r\nConference as an important opportunity for both the \r\nGovernment of Afghanistan and the international \r\ncommunity to restate their commitments within the \r\nmutual accountability framework.\r\nContinued international commitment to support \r\nAfghanistan is essential to achieving long-term \r\nstability and sustaining Afghanistan’s transformation. \r\nLatvia remains committed to a lasting partnership with \r\nAfghanistan. We welcome the signing of the bilateral \r\nsecurity agreement between the Government of \r\nAfghanistan and the United States and the NATO status-\r\nof-forces agreement as important steps for securing \r\nfuture international support in providing security in \r\nAfghanistan. Latvia will take part in the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force operation until the end of \r\nthis year and is fully committed to participating in \r\nthe new Resolute Support Mission. Latvia has already \r\ncommitted to providing financial support to the Afghan \r\nNational Security Forces on an annual basis from 2015 \r\nto 2017. Latvia will also continue its participation in the \r\ncivilian European Union Police Mission.\r\nMoreover, with the shifting of responsibilities in \r\nAfghanistan, the role of the United Nations and the \r\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan will \r\nonly increase and will require continued support by the \r\nUnited Nations membership.\r\nInternational commitment and support to Afghanistan \r\nshould go hand in hand with regional cooperation, \r\nstability and economic development. Afghanistan lies \r\nat the crossroads of the Middle East, Central Asian \r\nand South Asian regions, each of them with its own \r\ndynamics. However, we believe that middle ground can \r\nbe found and a space could be created where differences \r\nare left behind and constructive engagement emerges. \r\nLatvia supports the process emerging from the Istanbul \r\nProcess Ministerial Conference as an important \r\nopportunity to establish such a space of constructive \r\nand consistent engagement by neighbouring countries.\r\nIn the first half of next year, Latvia will hold the \r\npresidency of the Council of the European Union, and \r\nthe strengthening of relations between the EU and \r\nCentral Asia will be one of our presidency’s priorities. \r\nWe believe that close cooperation with the Central Asian \r\nStates is of the utmost importance for the promotion \r\nof regional security and economic development. The \r\nLatvian Government is currently looking for new ways \r\nto step up its development assistance in Afghanistan and \r\nCentral Asia. For instance, Latvia has already provided \r\ntraining for Afghan rail and civil aviation experts. \r\nOur long-term plans include providing scholarships \r\nto Afghan students in the fields of customs, guarding \r\nborders and railways. We just launched a new training \r\nprogramme for the Eastern Partnership region and \r\nCentral Asia, which could also be provided to Afghan \r\nstudents interested in building up their knowledge of \r\nEuropean law, economics and international affairs.\r\nWe believe that infrastructure projects that strengthen \r\nregional connectivity contribute greatly to regional \r\ncooperation and economic development. To contribute \r\nto those efforts, this summer Latvia hosted the third \r\nHigh-Level Conference on Transport, Logistics and \r\nTrade Routes on the theme “Connecting Asia with \r\nEurope”. It brought together more than 400 participants \r\nfrom countries of the Far East, South and Central Asia \r\nand from partner countries of the China and Central \r\nand Eastern European cooperation programme. Latvia \r\nwill continue its engagement in that regard.\r\nDuring Latvia’s presidency of the European \r\nUnion, we would like to organize, in the context of the \r\nAsia-Europe Meeting, the third transport ministers’ \r\nmeeting, side event and business forum on multimodal \r\ntransportation networks, to be held in Riga from 29 to \r\n30 April 2015.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate that Latvia will \r\nremain a reliable partner for both Afghanistan and \r\nthe international community in joining our efforts for \r\na peaceful, secure and prosperous Afghanistan and \r\nregion. An Afghan proverb says that a river is made \r\ndrop by drop, and we truly believe that.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/69/L.20, entitled “The situation in \r\nAfghanistan”.\r\nI give the floor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\n26/26 14-64064\r\nA/69/PV.57 20/11/2014\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nannounce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin document A/69/L.20, the following countries have \r\nalso become sponsors of the draft resolution: Albania, \r\nAndorra, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, \r\nBelize, Benin, Canada, China, Costa Rica, Cyprus, \r\nthe Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Finland, France, \r\nGeorgia, Guatemala, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, \r\nJordan, Kyrgyzstan, Lesotho, the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, Monaco, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, New \r\nZealand, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian \r\nFederation, San Marino, Senegal, Spain, Tajikistan, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Turkey, \r\nTurkmenistan and the United States of America.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nAssembly decides to adopt draft resolution A/69/L.20?\r\nDraft resolution A/69/L.20 was adopted (resolution \r\n69/18).\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 37?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.40 p.m.\r\n"
