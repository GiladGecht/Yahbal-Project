We welcome representatives warmly \r\nto New York to this important meeting.\r\nThe first three words of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which I always carry in my pocket, is “We the \r\npeoples”. And even if we are an organization of States \r\nworking under intergovernmental rules, we must never \r\nforget that we are here to serve the peoples — peoples \r\nwho deserve peace, development, human rights, the \r\nrule of law and a life of dignity.\r\nI have followed the fates of indigenous peoples \r\nthroughout my life and my career, and I am extremely \r\nhappy to see their representatives in this Hall. It was \r\na bumpy ride to get to this Conference, but now the \r\nrepresentatives are assembled here, and I am very \r\nglad that they have succeeded in coming together on \r\nan outcome document (resolution 69/2) that sets the \r\ndirection ahead.\r\nBut the work has just begun. We have a long \r\nway to go, and we should hurry up on that road. We \r\nhope that when representatives go back to their home \r\ncountries and environments and to all their friends at \r\nhome, they will carry the torch and take with them the \r\nbest of this meeting and of the common experiences \r\nthat representatives have shared. I think this meeting \r\noffers a huge possibility for networking, allowing \r\nrepresentatives to also see the collective strength of \r\nreaching out to their colleagues and friends in other \r\nparts of the world. I want representatives to know that \r\nwe are their partners, that we want to stand up for every \r\nhuman being’s equal value in the world, and that they \r\nhave been left behind for far too long.\r\nI will now move on to my formal speech. That was \r\nmy introduction. I am very glad to be in this Hall at this \r\nmoment. I am also very grateful that representatives \r\ncould hear my remarks now because I have a number \r\nof other meetings. As representatives know, we \r\nhave a meeting of huge importance for them — the \r\nclimate meeting. And I am going back to it after this \r\nintroduction.\r\nThis Conference builds on the work done and  the \r\nresults achieved since the adoption of the Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples seven years ago. \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.5\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n5th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 23 September 2014, 5 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/9 14-54561\r\nA/69/PV.5 23/09/2014\r\nThat Declaration is our foundation and guiding star. \r\nThe Conference outcome document is our inspiration \r\nand path ahead. Working together, indigenous \r\npeoples and Member States have identified important \r\npriorities and necessary actions on issues such as \r\nland, resources, justice systems, education, health and \r\ndevelopment — areas that affect the daily life of all the \r\npeople concerned.\r\nI am very much a human rights advocate, and \r\nhuman rights are at the core of our efforts. I am \r\nespecially pleased that the outcome document focuses \r\non indigenous women, youth and persons with \r\ndisabilities. I commend all representatives for their \r\ntireless work and for finalizing this very positive and \r\nforward-looking text. I am from Sweden. I once worked \r\nfor a Prime Minister who said that every society should \r\nbe judged by how it deals with the most vulnerable and \r\nexposed of its peoples, as that is how one can gauge the \r\nquality of life of a society. We should keep this in mind.\r\nToday, I hope, we will celebrate the achievements \r\nof this unprecedented Conference. But we will also \r\nbe remembering that, globally, indigenous peoples \r\ncontinue to lag behind in terms of education, health, \r\nemployment and, sadly, even life expectancy, as \r\nstatistics can prove. The Secretary-General and I \r\nintend to deal with those problems by building on the \r\nmomentum representatives have generated already, \r\nfor which we are extremely grateful. We can sense the \r\nmomentum in this Hall, what the representatives have \r\ngiven to the city of New York, and the fact that this \r\nmeeting at the United Nations coincides with so many \r\nother meetings bringing world leaders to this city and \r\nthis country.\r\nWe want to engage the indigenous peoples even \r\nmore actively across the United Nations system. The \r\nUnited Nations is now in the middle of identifying, as \r\nmany representatives know, our global development \r\npriorities beyond 2015. We are now in the end phase \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals era, and we \r\nhave approximately 450 days left to achieve those eight \r\nGoals. Sadly enough, we will not achieve several of the \r\nGoals. We will now identify the new set of goals. It \r\nis essential, in my view, that the issues of indigenous \r\npeoples are part of the new agenda. That agenda \r\nshould support their broader aspirations and those of \r\nrepresentatives for sustainable development, in line \r\nwith their rights and priorities.\r\nThe future we want values and seeks to preserve \r\ndiversity. The future we want requires more equitable \r\nand sustainable use of the world’s resources. We need \r\nto be at peace with nature. I have mediated in conflicts, \r\nI have been in humanitarian crisis situations, but what \r\nI really would like to do is to attend a negotiation on \r\npeace with nature. It is difficult, though, to see who \r\nwill sit on the other side of the table. I am sure many \r\nof the representatives in this Hall could represent the \r\nside of nature in the negotiations. Finally, the future we \r\nwant is one where all indigenous peoples realize their \r\nhuman rights. The Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights of 1948 should be obligatory reading in every \r\nschool around the world. It opens up both the beauty \r\nof the individual’s political and civil rights and also \r\neconomic and social rights.\r\nIn closing, the World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples shows what we can do when we unite, not only \r\nas Member States, but also as “We the peoples”. Nobody \r\ncan do everything, but everybody can do something. \r\nLet us never forget that. And let us remember that the \r\nUnited Nations is a reflection of two realities. The \r\nUnited Nations is a reflection of the world as it is, and \r\nit is not a pretty place. We have conflicts. We have \r\ninequalities. We have poverty. We have violations of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nSo that is one reality — the world as it is. But the \r\nUnited Nations is also a reflection of the world as it \r\nshould be, and our job is, for all of us in this room and \r\nfor all of us who serve this Organization and who serve \r\nthe peoples of the world, to diminish the gap between \r\nthe world as it is and the world as it should be. We will \r\nnot be able to bridge the gap, unfortunately — let us be \r\nrealistic — but we can diminish it, even if only by an \r\ninch. Again, everybody can do something.\r\nNow it is our collective responsibility, as Member \r\nStates, indigenous peoples, United Nations agencies, \r\nfunds and programmes, civil society, the private sector \r\nand the academic world, to transform the Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295) \r\ninto reality. That requires determination, tenacity, the \r\nappropriate legal framework, human and institutional \r\ncapacities, and, finally, political will. As the Assembly \r\nheard Al Gore say this morning, political will is a \r\nrenewable resource. We can renew, strengthen and even \r\ndouble the political will that is needed.\r\nParticipants here today are the catalysts, bearers \r\nand witnesses of this process, and I count on them, as \r\npartners with the United Nations, to deal with a better \r\nfuture for all in this world. We need to work for a life of \r\ndignity for all. A life of dignity for all is the theme of \r\n14-54561 3/9\r\n23/09/2014 A/69/PV.5\r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the post-2015 process \r\n(A/68/202), and we should keep that in mind. I thank \r\nthem all for their attention, their work and the work that \r\nthey will do. We are in this together. Let us go to work.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Deputy \r\nSecretary-General for his statement.\r\nAs previously announced, the Assembly will now \r\nhear presentations by the co-chairs of interactive round \r\ntable discussions 1, 2 and 3 and the interactive panel \r\ndiscussion.\r\nI give the f loor to Mr. Ghazali Ohorella, \r\nrepresentative of the Pacific indigenous region and \r\nco-chair of interactive round table discussion 1.\r\nMr. Ohorella: Yesterday we were served with a \r\ndelicious discourse provided by States, indigenous \r\npeoples and United Nations agencies, programmes and \r\nfunds. It was a luau feast of liberation and freedom.\r\nIn the Pacific, we know that one can paddle over \r\ngreat distances when many paddles are moving together. \r\nIf we continue in this spirit, our work will no longer \r\nseem impossible but, as I said in my opening statement, \r\nrather inevitable. I had the pleasure of co-chairing the \r\nsession with Mrs. Edita Hrdá, Permanent Representative \r\nof the Czech Republic, with a panel that consisted of \r\nMs. Victoria Tauli Corpuz, Special Rapporteur on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Mr. Atencio López, \r\nrepresentative of the Central and South American and \r\nCaribbean region; and Mr. Kanayo Nwanze, President \r\nof the International Fund for Agricultural Development \r\nas keynote speakers, with a large number of indigenous \r\nparticipants, United Nations agencies and Member \r\nStates.\r\nA consistent refrain during the discussion was that \r\nthe new collective consciousness can close the chasm \r\nand ensure that indigenous peoples do not slip through \r\nthe cracks at the United Nations. Various participants \r\nunderlined that the World Conference on indigenous \r\nPeoples and its outcome document (resolution 69/2) \r\nmarked a milestone for the United Nations system’s \r\nwork with indigenous peoples on issues that affect them. \r\nThere was broad consensus that, with the adoption of \r\nthe World Conference’s outcome document, the time \r\nhas come for the United Nations system to move from \r\nnormative discussions on indigenous peoples’ issues to \r\naction and the integration of indigenous peoples in the \r\nUnited Nations work at all levels.\r\nParticipants also stressed the importance of \r\nindigenous peoples’ full and equal participation in the \r\nUnited Nations system. They provided examples of how \r\nthis could be done through, first, ensuring indigenous \r\npeoples’ participation in various decision-making \r\ngovernance structures at the local, national, regional and \r\ninternational levels; secondly, recognizing indigenous \r\npeoples’ governments and high-level officials by \r\nproviding adequate United Nations status; and, thirdly, \r\nensuring that there are United Nations staff members \r\nwith indigenous backgrounds.\r\nIn line with the outcome document, several speakers \r\ncalled for the appointment of a senior indigenous United \r\nNations official at the level of Under-Secretary-General \r\nto oversee the implementation of the Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295) and \r\nto raise awareness of indigenous peoples’ issues within \r\nthe United Nations system and beyond.\r\nA key focus of several speakers was the United \r\nNations system’s work on indigenous peoples at the \r\nregional and national levels. The participants heard \r\nexamples of how regional and national United Nations \r\nmechanisms, including the regional commissions and \r\nthe United Nations country teams, can ensure that \r\nindigenous peoples are part of the development and \r\nstrategizing of programmes and activities in a structured \r\nand coherent manner, including in the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Assistance Frameworks, and by using \r\nthe United Nations Development Group’s “Guidelines \r\non Indigenous Peoples’ Issues” and ensuring the \r\navailability of relevant disaggregated data.\r\nNumerous speakers also committed to fully \r\nsupporting a system-wide action plan to ensure a coherent \r\napproach to achieving the ends of the Declaration, and \r\nwe look forward to the Secretary-General’s report to \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nRecommendations were made on establishing the \r\noversight mechanism as a monitoring mechanism for \r\nthe implementation of the Declaration. Some speakers \r\ncalled for the establishment of a new United Nations \r\nmechanism tasked with overseeing the Declaration’s \r\nimplementation, while others referred to updating \r\nexisting ones and strengthening the work of the United \r\nNations treaty bodies on indigenous peoples’ issues.\r\nThe call to strengthen the Inter-Agency Support \r\nGroup on Indigenous Peoples’ Issues was another key \r\npoint of discussion. Speakers alluded to the need for the \r\nSupport Group to become more effective through more \r\n4/9 14-54561\r\nA/69/PV.5 23/09/2014\r\nfrequent meetings with higher-level United Nations \r\nofficials.\r\nWe recognize a new era of empowerment and \r\nengagement, moving beyond what is wrong to what we \r\nwant for our world as we work together. We are already \r\nwalking forward towards ensuring our fundamental \r\nfreedoms, and we recognize the wisdom of calling for \r\nindigenous ambassadors. We welcome the presence \r\nand participation of the newly appointed United \r\nStates Ambassador to the Human Rights Council and \r\nCherokee native, Mr. Keith Harper.\r\nIt is clear that when indigenous peoples hold their \r\nlands in their own hands, this will lead to a realization of \r\ntheir rights. Indigenous peoples must be the protagonists \r\nof their own development processes and responsible for \r\nthe measurement of their own progress. Indigenous \r\npeoples are the canary in the coal mine of the world. We \r\nare the mercury in the barometer of the successes and \r\nfailures of the United Nations. The round table offered \r\nus a map to the stars where we can realize the dreams of \r\nour ancestors. In fact, we see the pledges and promises \r\nas providing action. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s \r\nclosing words yesterday morning were: “You will \r\nalways have a home at the United Nations”.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. David Choquehuanca Céspedes, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Plurinational State \r\nof Bolivia and co-chair of interactive round table \r\ndiscussion 2.\r\nMr. Choquehuanca Céspedes (Plurinational State \r\nof Bolivia) (spoke in Spanish): I greet the Assembly \r\ntoday by saying “Jayaya”, which, in Quechua, means \r\n“To life!”\r\nI am sorry for the delay in this wrap-up meeting. \r\nIndeed, we should learn from our indigenous brothers \r\nand sisters that when a lawyer makes an appointment \r\nwith an indigenous woman at 3 p.m., she will show up \r\nat 2.45 p.m., and the lawyer will show up at 4 p.m. We \r\nshould learn something from our indigenous brothers \r\nand sisters.\r\nI am going to present a summary of the work of \r\nround table 2 on the implementation of the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples at the national and local levels. \r\nRound table 2 was held on Monday, 22 September \r\n2014, from 3 to 6 p.m. The round table focused on the \r\nimplementation of the rights of indigenous peoples at \r\nthe national and local levels.\r\nIn their presentations, several States reaffirmed \r\ntheir support for the Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples. Many participants also welcomed \r\nthe final document and made note of the specific \r\ncommitments regarding the measures to be adopted \r\nby States and the United Nations to strengthen the \r\nimplementation of the rights of indigenous peoples at \r\nthe national and local levels.\r\nAt the same time, some participants raised the \r\nconcern that some issues were not reflected in the \r\nfinal document. Both Member States and indigenous \r\nrepresentatives stated that there had been progress at \r\nthe national level in the implementation of the rights \r\nof indigenous peoples, including the recognition \r\nof indigenous peoples and their rights in national \r\nconstitutions, laws, policies and programmes. The \r\nidentified examples covered a number of rights, \r\nincluding the rights to self-determination and autonomy, \r\nlands, territories and natural resources, consultation \r\nand free, prior and informed consent, education and \r\nindigenous languages , health, rights-based treaties and \r\nreconciliation. Examples of positive measures varied \r\namong States.\r\nWhile many notable advances were identified, \r\nparticipants also addressed the current challenges in \r\nthe implementation of the rights of indigenous peoples \r\nacross a range of issues and rights. Comments focused \r\non how to overcome the ongoing challenges. Several \r\nspeakers referred to the need for an ongoing dialogue \r\nbetween Governments and indigenous peoples. In that \r\nregard, it was noted that the participation of indigenous \r\npeoples in parliaments and other political bodies has \r\nbeen substantial, but that much remains to be done to \r\nstrengthen such participation at the national and local \r\nlevels. Member States and indigenous representatives \r\nalso referred to the importance of the development of \r\naction plans and policies relating to indigenous peoples \r\nand noted that the commitment in the final document in \r\nthat respect is a positive step.\r\nSeveral participants referred to the need for wider \r\nawareness among governmental actors, media and \r\nsociety in general in order to change discriminatory \r\nattitudes and prejudices against indigenous peoples in \r\nthe societies in which they live. Those are obstacles to \r\nthe realization of the rights of indigenous peoples. The \r\nissue of violence against women and girls and the need \r\nfor concerted action by States and the United Nations to \r\naddress it was also highlighted by several participants.\r\n14-54561 5/9\r\n23/09/2014 A/69/PV.5\r\nBeyond the action and the current challenges at \r\nnational and local levels, participants in the round table \r\nalso addressed the role of the United Nations system \r\nin promoting the implementation of the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples and the measures which could taken \r\nto strengthen their implementation. The provisions \r\nof the final document referring to the participation \r\nof indigenous representatives in the United Nations \r\nwere noted with appreciation by the Member States \r\nand indigenous representatives. In addition, several \r\nparticipants noted paragraphs of the final document \r\nas to the measures to use, modify and improve the \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations in order to achieve \r\nthe purposes of the Declaration.\r\nIn conclusion, I would ask that we \r\nall — representatives of States, representatives of \r\nindigenous peoples, indigenous leaders, political \r\nleaders who are participating in this important \r\nmeeting — bring our energy to the task of ensuring that \r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples are implemented and, \r\nif possible, strengthened, and ensuring that the United \r\nNations works hard towards this end. Each of us has \r\npositive energy that can be used for this purpose.. I am \r\ngoing to repeat,\r\n(spoke in Quechua)\r\nJayaya!\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nI would like all of us — because each one of us \r\nhas energy — to push collectively for what the United \r\nNations, our States and our indigenous leaders are \r\ndoing. We must join with them and support them — and \r\nnot crush their action. We must support it and push for \r\nit. I say once again “Jayaya” because it means “to life”. \r\nEverything that indigenous people are doing is for life, \r\nbrothers and sisters. Life comes first — everyone’s life, \r\nnot just the life of human beings, but of everything \r\nthat exists in Pachamama, our Mother Earth. “Jayaya, \r\nbrothers and sisters!”\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nMs. Jannie Lasimbang, representative of the Asia \r\nIndigenous Region and Chair of the interactive panel \r\ndiscussion.\r\nMs. Lasimbang: I have the honour of presenting a \r\nshort summary of the panel discussion on indigenous \r\npriorities for the post-2015 sustainable development \r\nagenda which I co-chaired with Ms. Patricia Balbuena, \r\nVice-Minister for Interculturality of Peru. We had three \r\npanel speakers, Mr. Wo Hongbo, from the Department \r\nof Economic and Social Affairs, Ms. Saudata \r\nAboubacrine, representative of the African Indigenous \r\nRegion, and Mr. Albert Deterville, from the Expert \r\nMechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. \r\nDespite our long list of speakers, we managed to hear \r\nfrom almost all of them in the panel discussion, thanks \r\nto their sticking to the three-minute time limit. \r\nI will be brief. I am just going to present some \r\nbullet points on the discussion and the conclusions that \r\nwe have reached.\r\nAmong the important aspects that are necessary \r\nwith respect to indigenous peoples and their priorities \r\nin the post-2015 sustainable development agenda is to \r\nsecure the adequate inclusion of the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples in the post-2015 development agenda. The \r\nrights enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples should be the basis for \r\ntheir inclusion. Indigenous peoples should participate \r\nactively in the development of policies and programmes \r\nand in the implementation of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda at the national and international levels. Specific \r\nindicators on indigenous peoples should be included in \r\nthat agenda. It is not enough to simply add them to the \r\nlist of vulnerable groups.\r\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, it \r\nis imperative to be respectful of indigenous peoples’ \r\ndevelopment according to their own aspirations and to be \r\nrespectful of their cultures and identities. The post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda should also reflect what Member \r\nStates agreed at this World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeoples, in particular what we have committed to in the \r\noutcome document (resolution 69/2), that is, respect for \r\nthe rights of indigenous peoples, including indigenous \r\nknowledge to sustain the environment and to combat \r\nclimate change.\r\nIt is also very important to recognize the rights \r\nto lands, territories and resources, the right to self-\r\ndetermination and the principle of free, prior and \r\ninformed consent as some of the main pillars for \r\nachieving sustainable development for indigenous \r\npeoples. The participation of indigenous youth, women \r\nand persons with disabilities should be guaranteed in \r\nany process related to development, and the human-\r\nrights-based approach to development should be \r\nincorporated in the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nOther points were brought up by the speakers, \r\nincluding the need to develop specific indicators \r\n6/9 14-54561\r\nA/69/PV.5 23/09/2014\r\non indigenous peoples’ well-being in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Some speakers pointed out that \r\nthe data with respect to indigenous peoples shows that \r\nthey are lagging behind in many aspects and that it \r\nis necessary to take action to improve their situation. \r\nDevelopment should therefore be according to their \r\nown aspirations and needs.\r\nAnother point made was that there cannot be \r\ndevelopment if indigenous peoples’ rights are not \r\nincluded. It is difficult to talk about the development \r\nof indigenous peoples if, on a daily basis, they become \r\nvictims of displacement from their lands and their \r\nterritories.\r\nThose brief and salient points summarize what was \r\ndiscussed during our panel discussion.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nMs. Joan Carling, representative of the Asia Indigenous \r\nRegion and co-chair of interactive round table \r\ndiscussion 3.\r\nMs. Carling: First of all, I feel privileged to have \r\nco-chaired round table 3 with Mr. Pita Sharples of \r\nNew Zealand. During round table 3, on the theme of \r\nindigenous peoples’ lands, territories and resources, \r\nrepresentatives made statements on the following \r\nsubjects.\r\nFirst, indigenous peoples have a close relationship \r\nwith their lands, territories and resources. It constitutes \r\nthe heart of their collective survival and development and \r\nis linked to the survival of their identity and spiritual and \r\ncultural well-being. Indigenous peoples’ relationship \r\nto their lands, territories and resources is outlined in \r\nvarious articles of the United Nations Declaration on \r\nthe Rights of Indigenous Peoples (resolution 61/295) \r\nand in various paragraphs of the outcome document of \r\nthe World Conference on Indigenous Peoples (resolution \r\n69/2). However, speakers pointed out that there is a lack \r\nof recognition of indigenous peoples’ lands, territories \r\nand resources and a lack of recognition of indigenous \r\npeoples in general.\r\nThe second point concerns the action of States \r\nand United Nations agencies. Some States have legally \r\nrecognized indigenous peoples’ collective land rights \r\nand have taken measures to protect sacred sites and \r\nheritage areas. There are also efforts to provide \r\ncompensation for lands, territories and resources taken \r\naway from indigenous peoples.\r\nThe third point has to do with the implementation \r\nof United Nations agencies’ programmes that address \r\nindigenous peoples’ sustainable resource management \r\nof lands, territories and resources and food resources \r\nand with the enhancement of biodiversity and food \r\nsecurity. Those lands, territories and resources are \r\nthreatened. Indigenous peoples have now reached a \r\ntipping point in their continuing collective survival as \r\ndistinct peoples, along with their distinct identities and \r\ncultural heritage, due to dispossession, destruction, \r\nmilitarization and continuing threats to their lands, \r\nterritories and resources.\r\nColonization has affected indigenous peoples’ \r\nguardianship of their lands, territories and resources. \r\nFor many decades, those issues have been the primary \r\nand most urgent concern for indigenous peoples. In \r\nmany instances, national laws allow for the occupation \r\nof indigenous peoples’ lands, territories and resources, \r\nand that has led to forced evictions, land-grabbing, \r\nconcession permits for timber plantations and mining \r\nand other extractive industries and the delineation of \r\nnational parks and protected areas without the free, \r\nprior and informed consent of indigenous peoples. The \r\ncontinuing violation of the principle of free, prior and \r\ninformed consent in relation to lands, territories and \r\nresources is causing more poverty, marginalization and \r\nconflicts.\r\nFinally, there is the call for action. First, there \r\nmust be legal security for the lands, territories and \r\nresources of indigenous peoples as a precondition to \r\nachieving sustainable development, and that includes \r\nthe protection of their traditional occupations, \r\nlivelihoods and sustainable resource management \r\nsystems. Partnerships are needed between indigenous \r\npeoples and Governments at the global and national \r\nlevels. The principle of free, prior and informed \r\nconsent must be immediately implemented, on the basis \r\nof the Declaration and the World Conference outcome \r\ndocument. There must be compensation and redress \r\nfor lands illegally taken from indigenous peoples and \r\nregulation of corporations that are violating indigenous \r\npeoples’ rights to their lands, territories and resources.\r\nStates are called upon to immediately establish \r\nindependent and impartial processes to adjudicate and \r\nadvance indigenous peoples’ rights over their lands, \r\nterritories, waters and natural resources, as reflected in \r\nthe outcome document. States were called upon to take \r\nmeasures, including legislative measures, to implement \r\nthe rights enshrined in the Declaration. There is an \r\n14-54561 7/9\r\n23/09/2014 A/69/PV.5\r\nurgent need to protect the remaining traditional grazing \r\nlands, hunting grounds, fishing waters, including coastal \r\nwaters, and gathering areas, and to give priority to laws \r\npertaining to lands, waters, territories and resources. \r\nThe same recommendation applies to the commitment \r\nto develop and implement national action plans aimed \r\nat implementing the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: I should now like to consult \r\nmembers with a view to giving the f loor to Mr. Setareki \r\nMacanawai, Indigenous Disabilities Representative. If \r\nthere is no objection, may I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and without setting a precedent, to \r\ninvite Mr. Setareki Macanawai, Indigenous Disabilities \r\nRepresentative, to make a statement at this meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with \r\nthe decision just taken, I now give the f loor to \r\nMr. Macanawai.\r\nMr. Macanawai: I am speaking today on behalf \r\nof the Indigenous Persons with Disabilities Global \r\nNetwork and the Global Disability Caucus, a Network \r\nrepresenting indigenous persons with disabilities from \r\nall seven geopolitical regions of the indigenous peoples. \r\nAt this juncture I wish to thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the opportunity to address this \r\nforum to be the voice of the voiceless. \r\nThose of us who have been at the margins of society \r\nfor a long time have been excluded and forgotten at the \r\nclosing this historic conference. Indigenous persons \r\nwith disabilities face multiple types of discrimination \r\nand barriers to participation in society, including \r\nwith regard to access to development programmes \r\nand funding, education, employment, health care \r\ncommunication and transport services. As indigenous \r\npersons with disabilities, we are overrepresented among \r\nthose living in absolute poverty, and we continue to \r\nexist as one of the world’s most vulnerable populations. \r\nIt is for that reason that we, both the Global \r\nDisabilities Network and the Global Disability Caucus, \r\napplaud Member States for adopting the outcome \r\ndocument of the World Conference on Indigenous \r\nPeople (resolution 69/2), which includes vital references \r\nto indigenous persons with disabilities in paragraphs 9, \r\n10 and 18. The inclusion of indigenous persons with \r\ndisabilities in legislation programmes, disaggregation \r\nof data by disability status and a commitment to \r\nthe elimination of violence and discrimination are \r\nkey challenges faced by us indigenous people with \r\ndisabilities today. The participation and inclusion \r\nof persons with disabilities should be central to \r\npolicymaking, programme implementation, monitoring \r\nand evaluation of mechanisms addressing the rights of \r\nindigenous people. \r\nOnly an inclusive and empowered society will \r\nensure that no one is left behind. The commitment by \r\nMember States, enshrined in the outcome document, to \r\nensure that national legislative forces and institutional \r\nstructures relating to indigenous peoples are inclusive \r\nof indigenous persons with disabilities is indeed a strong \r\nstep forward and in the right direction in recognizing \r\nand promoting those rights. The development of the \r\nrights of indigenous persons with disabilities means that \r\ndecisions are not taken without our full consultation and \r\nparticipation through our representative organizations. \r\nThat development must also be in accordance with the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous \r\nPeoples and the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities. \r\nI would like to stress again the importance of a \r\nstand-alone paragraph on indigenous persons with \r\ndisabilities in the outcome document. I call for the \r\ndisaggregation of data on disability status, which is \r\ncurrently recognized in the work leading to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. In the new development \r\nagenda, in the new world that we are building, \r\nindigenous people and persons with disabilities must be \r\nincluded. To ensure that and to guarantee that we are not \r\nleft behind once again, the future development goals, \r\ntargets and indicators must be inclusive of indigenous \r\npeoples and indigenous persons with disabilities. \r\nI close with the words of Desmond Tutu: “My \r\nhumanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be \r\nhuman together.” \r\nThe Acting President: I will now read out a \r\nstatement on behalf of His Excellency Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa, President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session.\r\n“As we come to the closing meeting of the \r\nhistoric World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, \r\nI am heartened to note the critical successes of this \r\nConference, which would not have been possible \r\nwithout the inclusive way in which indigenous \r\npeoples of the world and Member States approached \r\nthese discussions.\r\n8/9 14-54561\r\nA/69/PV.5 23/09/2014\r\n“At the outset, I would like to extend my deep \r\nappreciation to all Conference participants for \r\ntheir valuable contributions, including Heads of \r\nState and Government, Member State delegations, \r\nindigenous elders, representatives of tribal \r\ngovernments and indigenous organizations, United \r\nNations system representatives and civil society. \r\nWithout your active engagement and commitment \r\nto this endeavour, the Conference surely would not \r\nhave yielded such positive results.\r\n“Yesterday’s adoption by the General Assembly \r\nof the outcome document (resolution 69/2) \r\nsignified a new chapter in the ongoing dialogue \r\nand engagement between indigenous peoples and \r\nMember States. It will serve as a guiding document \r\ngoing forward, building on the commitments \r\nthe international community previously made \r\nin the foundation document, the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\r\n“There have been many outcomes from United \r\nNations conferences, but this document is unique \r\nbecause of the inclusive way in which indigenous \r\npeoples and Member States turned their shared \r\ngoals into a reality. Indigenous peoples insisted on \r\nsuch an inclusive process from the very beginning, \r\nand thanks to our collective efforts, we successfully \r\nmet that aspiration. It was this inclusive approach \r\nthat has made this Conference a success.\r\n“The outcome document represents a balance \r\nbetween what indigenous peoples sought as further \r\ncommitments towards more effective realization of \r\ntheir rights and what Member States could agree \r\nupon. I am convinced that its action-oriented \r\nprovisions, when implemented, will bring about \r\nsweeping changes for current and future generations \r\nof indigenous peoples.\r\n“The outcome document accords importance \r\nto national actions plans and to a system-wide \r\naction plan for greater coherence within the United \r\nNations system. The document also focuses on \r\nthe rights of indigenous women and addresses the \r\nintractable problem of violence against women, \r\nwhich must be at the top of the agenda. The \r\ndocument speaks eloquently to the challenges faced \r\nby indigenous youth, the difficulty in sustaining \r\nindigenous languages, the need to preserve \r\nindigenous knowledge and the requirement to \r\nensure sustainable livelihoods. All those issues \r\nform the core of the broad and integrated agenda \r\nwhich indigenous people have called for over the \r\nlast two decades.\r\n“In the round-table discussions, speakers \r\nstressed the vital importance of implementing the \r\nprovisions of the Declaration. Let me echo that call \r\nto action. Within the framework of the emerging \r\ndevelopment paradigm, Member States, the United \r\nNations system, civil society and the private sector \r\nmust join in a collective endeavour to make a \r\ndifference for indigenous peoples worldwide.\r\n“I wish to thank the four advisers to the \r\nPresident who facilitated this conference. The \r\nunwavering commitment and determination \r\nshown by Ambassador Andrej Logar of Slovenia, \r\nAmbassador Marjon Kamara of Liberia, and the \r\ntwo indigenous advisers, Mr. Les Malezer and \r\nMs. Mirna Cunningham, were exemplary. As we \r\nconclude this Conference here today, I urge each \r\nand every one of you to do your part to keep the \r\nmomentum of our discussions moving forward in \r\na positive and productive manner. The signing of \r\nthe outcome document is a pivotal moment for our \r\nwork and should stand as a beacon of our renewed \r\ncommitment to ensuring the inclusion of indigenous \r\nissues in the future work of the United Nations.”\r\nI now give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Pita \r\nSharples, Minister of Maori Affairs of New Zealand, \r\nwho will deliver the closing prayer for this high-level \r\nmeeting.\r\nMr. Sharples (New Zealand): I should note that I \r\nhave just resigned from the New Zealand Government \r\nas Minister of Maori Affairs, so this is probably my last \r\nofficial act as Minister, but perhaps I can come back \r\nnext year to do the prayer.\r\nTo all those who were present at the meetings \r\nI co-chaired, and whom I asked to hurry up, stop \r\nspeaking and all those things, I promise I will take less \r\nthan three minutes. Let us pray.\r\nWe thank you for your presence and your blessings \r\nupon us throughout this Conference. It is now with some \r\nhumility that we ask for your guidance to advance this \r\nventure, to protect and promote the rights of indigenous \r\npersons within their respective nations to confront their \r\nchallenges and meet those who would put barriers in \r\ntheir way. Where there is darkness, bring light; where \r\nthere is ignorance, bring understanding; where there is \r\narrogance, bring humility, so that indigenous persons \r\ncan walk free and tall in their own cultural norms, and \r\n14-54561 9/9\r\n23/09/2014 A/69/PV.5\r\nparticipate fully in the life of their nations. And as we \r\nreturn home, we ask for your blessings so that we may \r\nbe happily reunited with our families awaiting us.\r\nThe Acting President: The high-level plenary \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to be known as the \r\nWorld Conference on Indigenous Peoples is now ended. \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 65.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.\r\n"
