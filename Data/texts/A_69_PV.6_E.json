I give the \r\nf loor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: It is a great honour to \r\nwelcome everyone to this renovated General Assembly \r\nHall. This great Hall is home to “We the peoples”. It has \r\nbeen restored, renewed and reinvented for the twenty-\r\nfirst century. I thank all present for making it possible. \r\nThe Capital Master Plan was not an easy project. But \r\nthe Member States embraced the vision. They made \r\nthe investment. Now we see the wonderful results: a \r\nstate-of-the-art space in which we shall work together \r\nto improve the state of the world.\r\nWe wanted to have a grand opening ceremony. \r\nBut because of frugality and time we decided to have \r\na virtual grand opening ceremony. In the name of all \r\npeoples and all nations, I am now proud to officially \r\ndeclare this General Assembly Hall open for business. \r\nMembers saved a lot of money by having this virtual \r\nopening ceremony. I thank them very much for their \r\nunderstanding.\r\nEvery year at this time, hope fills this Hall — the \r\nhope embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe hopes of leaders who speak from this rostrum, \r\nthe hopes of people across the world who hear those \r\npromises. This year, the horizon of hope has darkened. \r\nOur hearts have been made very heavy by unspeakable \r\nacts and the deaths of innocents. Cold War ghosts have \r\nreturned to haunt our times. We have seen so much of \r\nthe Arab Spring go violently wrong.\r\nNot since the end of the Second World War have \r\nthere been so many refugees, displaced people and \r\nasylum seekers. Never before has the United Nations \r\nbeen asked to reach so many people with emergency \r\nfood assistance and other life-saving supplies. \r\nDiplomacy is on the defensive, undermined by those \r\nwho believe in violence. Diversity is under assault by \r\nextremists who insist that their way is the only way. \r\nDisarmament is viewed as a distant dream, sabotaged \r\nby profiteers of perpetual warfare.\r\nIt may seem as if the world is falling apart, as \r\ncrises pile up and diseases spread. But leadership is \r\nprecisely about finding the seeds of hope and nurturing \r\nthem into something bigger. That is our duty. That \r\nis my call on members today. It has been a terrible \r\nyear for the principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. From barrel bombs to beheadings, \r\nfrom the deliberate starvation of civilians to assaults \r\non hospitals, United Nations shelters and aid convoys, \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law are under attack.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAfter the latest tragedy in Gaza, Palestinians and \r\nIsraelis seem more polarized than ever. If we do not \r\nsave the two-State solution, we will be left in a state \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.6\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n6th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 24 September 2014, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nof permanent hostilities. The situation in and around \r\nUkraine remains unstable. In South Sudan, the struggle \r\nfor political power has killed thousands of people and \r\nexposed millions to the threat of famine. The Central \r\nAfrican Republic is fractured and traumatized. Mali \r\nand the Sahel continue to suffer from insurgency, \r\nterrorism, the drug trade and organized crime. In \r\nSomalia, a coalition of African States confronts the \r\nterrorist group Al-Shabaab. In Nigeria, Boko Haram’s \r\nmurderous onslaught gained strength, with shocking \r\nconsequences for women and girls.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn Iraq and Syria, we see new depths of barbarity \r\nwith each passing day and devastating spillover effects \r\nacross the region. As Muslim leaders around the \r\nworld have repeatedly said, there is nothing Islamic \r\nabout the terrorist organizations wreaking havoc in \r\nthe region. Those extremist groups are a clear threat \r\nto international peace and security that requires a \r\nmultifaceted international response. We need decisive \r\naction to stop atrocity crimes and frank discussions on \r\nwhat created the threat in the first place. The people \r\nof the region have been forced to walk on the broken \r\nshards of bad governance and bad decisions that fail to \r\nrespect international law and basic human rights.\r\nAcross the world, the fragility of States and \r\ninstitutions has never been more apparent. Some have \r\nbeen hollowed out by corruption; others have pursued \r\npolicies of exclusion that drive the victims towards \r\nanger, despair and violence. States must uphold their \r\nresponsibility to govern — and govern for all their \r\npeople.\r\nEven where there is no overt warfare, violence \r\nstill mars lives. Men prey on women across the globe, \r\nfrom battlefields to streets, from public spaces to \r\nthe privacy of the home. Migrants face increasingly \r\nperilous journeys, and closed doors upon arrival. In \r\nmany countries seen as models of integration, divisive \r\npolitics are on the rise. People are very good at seeing \r\nprejudice in others, but less so in themselves. The trends \r\nthat bring people together — instant communications, \r\nfree trade and ease of travel — are also being exploited \r\nby forces that keep them apart. The world’s “fasten \r\nseat belt” light is illuminated. Turbulence is testing the \r\nmultilateral system, national institutions and people’s \r\nlives.\r\nHuman rights provide one touchstone for our \r\nresponse. The Rights Up Front initiative aims to place \r\nhuman rights at the centre of our thinking and our \r\nefforts in the field. The protection of nearly 100,000 \r\npeople at United Nations bases throughout South Sudan \r\nhas been an early milestone of that new approach. \r\nThe international community needs to be similarly \r\nsensitized to the value of human rights violations as \r\nan early-warning mechanism. I urge Member States \r\nto fulfil their responsibilities to their populations. \r\nStates also need to be open to discussing their own \r\nvulnerabilities. Let us recall that the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights not only proclaims a set \r\nof freedoms; it also warns that people will not stand \r\nidle if they are not protected. We need to do far more to \r\nanticipate problems and reach early political consensus.\r\nTo better meet the challenges before us, I have called \r\nfor a review of the United Nations peace operations and \r\nwill appoint a high-level review panel in the coming \r\nweeks. The unity of the Security Council is crucial. \r\nWhen the Security Council acts as one, we see results, \r\nsuch as the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons \r\nprogramme, agreement on a peacekeeping operation \r\nfor the Central African Republic, timely support for the \r\npeace framework in the Great Lakes region of Africa. \r\nBy contrast, continued disunity over Syria has resulted \r\nin grave human suffering and loss of credibility for the \r\nCouncil and our Organization. The General Assembly \r\nmust also uphold its responsibilities and play its rightful \r\nrole.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe must not let the smoke from today’s fires \r\nblind us to longer-term challenges and opportunities. \r\nHope may be hard to discern, but it is there. In clinics, \r\nclassrooms and other places far from the spotlight, the \r\ndevelopment agenda is making remarkable progress. \r\nPoverty, child mortality and maternal deaths have been \r\ncut in half. More remains to be done, but those and other \r\ngains show the power of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and what we can do when we work together.\r\nToday, an inspiring global conversation is taking \r\nplace on an agenda for the next 15 years. Earlier this \r\nmonth, small island developing States added their voices \r\nwith the adoption of the Samoa Pathway, a far-reaching \r\nplan for addressing their unique vulnerabilities. Two \r\ndays ago, in this Hall, we heard the appeals of the world’s \r\nindigenous peoples for an end to marginalization (see \r\nA/69/PV.4). That same day, world leaders reaffirmed \r\nthe importance of continuing to implement the \r\ngroundbreaking consensus of the Cairo International \r\nConference on Population and Development.\r\n14-54711 3/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nThe conversation for the future that we want is \r\none of the most inclusive initiatives in United Nations \r\nhistory. More than 5 million people have now voted \r\nin the “My World” survey. I hope millions more will \r\ngo on line to give their opinion. What is emerging \r\nfrom our dialogue is a remarkable project, a universal \r\nagenda that applies to all countries, a witness to the \r\ndetermination not to reduce but to eradicate extreme \r\npoverty and hunger, and to allow all countries and all \r\ncommunities to set out on the path of truly sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe General Assembly’s Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals has just placed before \r\nus a proposed set of sustainable development goals \r\nthat will allow us to complete the unfinished business \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals, overcome \r\ninequalities, protect the planet and build the future we \r\nwant. At the end of the year, at members’ request, I \r\nwill provide a synthesis report that will set the stage as \r\nMember States begin their negotiations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nTransformation is our goal. I can think of no better \r\nplace to start than with opening doors and shattering \r\nceilings for women and girls. Stereotypes continue to \r\nbe deeply entrenched. Look at any crisis, from poverty \r\nto disaster, from disease to illiteracy, and you will see \r\nwomen and girls suffering the most. We cannot fulfil \r\n100 per cent of the world’s potential by excluding 50 per \r\ncent of the world’s people.\r\nClimate action is integral to all our hopes. Three \r\ndays ago, in the streets of our host city, New York, I \r\njoined hundreds of thousands of people in marching \r\nfor a cleaner, greener future. They sent a powerful \r\nmessage to the leaders of their impatience, but \r\nalso of opportunity. Yesterday’s Climate Summit \r\nwas a landmark event. We saw a great coming \r\ntogether of countries, capitals, CEOs and citizens. \r\nMultistakeholder coalitions took unprecedented action \r\nto reduce emissions, build resilience and finance the \r\ntransformation of our economies and societies. We must \r\nconvert this momentum into a meaningful, universal \r\nclimate agreement in Lima this December and in Paris \r\nnext year. As one of the banners in the march said, we \r\nhave a duty to do what must be done.\r\nFunding is crucial for the credibility of climate \r\nand post-2015 development efforts. Now is the time \r\nto more properly match global wealth with global \r\nneed. All resources — public and private, domestic \r\nand international — need to be tapped. When budgets \r\nare cut to the bone, people bleed. When resources are \r\ndevoted to ever more sophisticated arms instead of \r\never-greater human potential, we are all less secure. \r\nLeadership is also about getting our priorities straight, \r\nour policies right and our investments working for \r\npeople. The next 15 months will be a defining period \r\nfor global prosperity and stability. I urge all present to \r\nkeep their ambitions high.\r\nThe outbreak of Ebola in West Africa is an \r\nunprecedented crisis. That is why I have established \r\nan unprecedented health operation — the United \r\nNations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response \r\n(UNMEER) — to mobilize all the resources needed \r\nto reinforce work being done by the countries and \r\ncommunities affected. The Mission combines the \r\nexpertise of the World Health Organization with the \r\nlogistical capacities of the United Nations. UNMEER \r\npersonnel arrived in Ghana two days ago to establish \r\nthe Mission’s headquarters.\r\nThe international community is rallying to assist \r\nlocal health workers. Now we need a twentyfold surge in \r\ncare, tracking, transport and equipment. Food security \r\nis a growing concern, as food prices have gone up and \r\nfood systems are in danger of breaking down. We must \r\nalso fight the virus of fear and misinformation. Bans \r\non travel or transport will not keep Ebola from getting \r\nout but will keep medical personnel and supplies from \r\ngetting in. We need to isolate people affected by Ebola, \r\nbut not the nations struggling to cope with it. With \r\nleadership and solidarity, we can help the people of \r\nGuinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone bring the outbreak to \r\nan end and regain the path to a better future.\r\nThe world recently marked the 100th anniversary \r\nof the outbreak of the First World War. Like so many \r\nconflicts, that war started less from grand design than \r\nfrom small problems badly handled. After the Second \r\nWorld War, the founding of the United Nations was \r\na feat of global resolve. The post-war planners were \r\ndriven not only by the idea of “never again” but by \r\na vision of what the world could be if we “unite our \r\nstrength”. Today we face a profusion of mounting \r\nchallenges. People are crying out for protection from \r\ngreed and inequality. The United Nations must answer \r\nthat call.\r\nWe are a century removed from the First World \r\nWar and have 70 years of experience with the United \r\nNations, yt the world is still not as peaceful as it could \r\nand should be. Today we face far more man-made \r\n4/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ncrises than natural calamities. We may not control \r\nMother Nature, but who else but us is responsible for \r\nsecuring peace and justice in our world? War, poverty, \r\nignorance — crises caused by people can be stopped by \r\npeople. I do not think we can yet feel comfortable about \r\nthe world our generation is leaving to our children. \r\nStill, I have hope. I draw it from our Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, our enduring guide in times of dramatic \r\nchallenge and change. I am continually inspired by the \r\nstaff, peacekeepers, humanitarian workers, human \r\nrights defenders and others who bring our document, \r\nthis Charter, to life.\r\nJust as we have renovated this great Hall for a \r\nnew age, I look the Heads of State and Government \r\nto rebuild leadership and restore unity of purpose. We \r\ncan tackle any challenge — and we will, as the United \r\nNations. I thank them for their leadership.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I will now deliver my statement in \r\nmy capacity as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session.\r\nI am honoured and humbled by the trust and \r\nconfidence Member States have bestowed on me and my \r\ncountry, Uganda, in electing me to serve as President \r\nof the General Assembly during its sixty-ninth session. \r\nMy thanks go to my President, who nominated me, \r\nmy continent, which endorsed me, and the General \r\nAssembly, which elected me by acclamation.\r\nThis session and the coming year will be momentous. \r\nWe will commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations. We will also commemorate 20 years \r\nsince the ground-breaking Fourth World Conference on \r\nWomen, reach the target date for the achievement of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and formulate \r\nand adopt the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nWhen the United Nations was founded nearly \r\n69 years ago, it was an untested vision that was \r\npreoccupied with efforts to heal a world that had \r\nbeen ravaged by the scourge of war. It included only \r\n51 countries, which is a tiny fraction of the 193 Member \r\nStates that make up its membership today. It is therefore \r\nfitting that the Charter stresses the determination by \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations to reaffirm their faith \r\nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \r\nof the human person and in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen and of nations large and small, and to promote \r\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom. We have collectively achieved a lot as Member \r\nStates over the past seven decades in maintaining peace \r\nand security, promoting human rights and fostering \r\ndevelopment, but a lot more remains to be done.\r\nThe world today is vastly different from what \r\nit was in 1945, but one thing remains constant: the \r\nneed to work together to harness opportunities for \r\nprosperity and find solutions to the global challenges \r\nconfronting humanity. We need to strengthen further \r\nthis cooperation among Member States and promote \r\npeace, tolerance and compromise.\r\nWe are gathered here today at a time of \r\nunprecedented historic opportunity to improve the \r\nlivelihoods of all people and set the world on a path \r\ntowards achieving sustainable development. That \r\ndevelopment must be achieved in both the economic \r\nand the social and environmental dimensions of our \r\nworld. I am reminded of the wise saying of Mahatma \r\nGandhi, who exhorted all of us to be the change that \r\nwe want to see in the world. It will take our collective \r\nefforts and action to attain that goal.\r\nSince the adoption of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) nearly 15 years ago, the lives of \r\nmillions of people worldwide have undoubtedly \r\nchanged. A number of MDG targets have been met, \r\nothers are on course to be met, and a number will likely \r\nnot be met by the target date. We must continue to \r\nbuild on the foundation laid by the MDGs, with nearly \r\n1 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty, increased \r\nuniversal primary education, maternal and infant \r\nmortality reduced by nearly 50 per cent and increased \r\naccess to clean drinking water, to mention some of the \r\nsignificant achievements. Yet a lot remains to be done. \r\nThe sanitation target lags far behind, too many women \r\nstill die in labour and inequalities within and among \r\ncountries remain very high. With fewer than 470 days \r\nto the MDG target date, we must intensify our efforts to \r\naccelerate progress and achieve as many MDG targets \r\nas possible in the remaining period.\r\nIn the coming months, we will be preoccupied \r\nwith formulating the new agenda, which should be \r\nambitious, transformative and produce tangible benefits \r\nand improved livelihoods for all. With the eradication \r\nof poverty and hunger at its core, the new agenda \r\nshould promote sustained and inclusive economic \r\n14-54711 5/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\ngrowth, safeguard the future of our planet and lead to \r\nthe achievement of sustainable development.\r\nWe will use the outcomes of the intergovernmental \r\nprocesses, namely, the proposal on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, the report of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing, the recommendations from the structured \r\ndialogues on a technology facilitation mechanism and \r\nthe forthcoming Secretary-General’s synthesis report. \r\nThe outcome of the third Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, which will be held in July 2015 in Addis \r\nAbaba, will also be vital.\r\nOur greatest responsibility will be to ensure \r\nthat adequate means for implementing the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda in terms of finances, technology \r\ndevelopment and transfer, and capacity-building are \r\nmobilized and effectively utilized. That is why I chose \r\nas the theme for the general debate of this session \r\n“Delivering on and implementing a transformative \r\npost-2015 development agenda”.\r\nOne of the key issues we must pay particular \r\nattention to is infrastructure development. It will \r\nbe pivotal in accelerating economic growth and \r\ndevelopment, expanding opportunities and improving \r\nlives. It is therefore essential to prioritize investments \r\nin infrastructure, especially energy, roads, railways, \r\nwaterways, airports, ports, border-crossing facilities \r\nand information and communications technology. \r\nSignificant infrastructure deficits in many developing \r\ncountries, particularly countries in special situations, \r\nAfrica, least developed countries, landlocked least \r\ndeveloped countries and small island developing States, \r\nresult in increased production and transaction costs and \r\nreduce their competitiveness.\r\nI call upon all Member States and all stakeholders to \r\nwork tirelessly over the next 12 months to formulate and \r\nagree on a truly transformative agenda, to be adopted \r\nin September next year. Let us always remember that \r\nwe carry the expectations of millions and millions of \r\npeople who yearn for a better future. Many issues and \r\nchallenges will require our attention and efforts during \r\nthis session. Allow me to highlight a few of them.\r\nWhile a lot of progress has been made towards \r\nthe eradication of extreme poverty, we still have \r\nnearly a billion people trapped in poverty. We must \r\ntherefore put poverty eradication at the forefront \r\nof the development agenda. We need to address the \r\nrising inequality within and between countries, which \r\ncontinues to pose formidable challenges to our efforts \r\nto improve the life of every human being. For many \r\ndeveloping countries, improved market access, debt \r\nsustainability and access to essential medicines for the \r\npoor remain persistent challenges. We must continue \r\nto advance gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen. We must do more to increase the access of \r\ngirls to education, increase women’s participation in \r\nleadership and decision-making positions, and enhance \r\ntheir economic empowerment. I will be convening a \r\nhigh-level thematic debate on the topic in February \r\nnext year.\r\nOn health, we need to step up efforts to \r\ncombat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other \r\ncommunicable and non-communicable diseases. We \r\nhave seen in recent months the loss of lives and the \r\ndire effects caused by the Ebola outbreak in some West \r\nAfrican countries, whose health systems have been \r\noverwhelmed. I also thank the Secretary-General and \r\nMembers of the United Nations for the Mission that has \r\nbeen set up to combat the outbreak of that epidemic. \r\nGlobally, hundreds of thousands of women continue \r\nto die from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes. \r\nIn many developing countries, preventable medical \r\nconditions are still the main killer of children under the \r\nage of 5\r\nThe outlook for education is equally mixed. While \r\nunder the Millennium Development Goals campaign \r\nprimary-school enrolment increased exponentially, the \r\nissue of quality also needs to be addressed. For tertiary \r\neducation, skills development needs greater attention.\r\nOne of the most pressing challenges we face is the \r\nincreasing level of unemployment. The rate of youth \r\nunemployment is almost three times higher than that for \r\nadult unemployment and in some cases exceeds 50 per \r\ncent. That puts in sharp focus the need to ensure that the \r\npost-2015 development agenda is truly transformative \r\nand leads to increased job opportunities.\r\nAs yesterday’s Climate Summit highlighted, \r\nclimate change is a defining challenge of our times. \r\nWe are witnessing the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, including rising sea levels, land degradation, \r\ndesertification and changing weather patterns, among \r\nothers. As demonstrated during the recent United \r\nNations Conference on Small Island Developing States \r\n(SIDS), held in Samoa, SIDS and the least developed \r\ncountries are particularly vulnerable to the effects of \r\nclimate change. I intend to convene a high-level event \r\non combating climate change in June 2015 to further \r\n6/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ngalvanize political support for efforts to reach a global \r\nagreement in 2015 under the auspices of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nWe have recently witnessed an alarming increase in \r\nthe number of violent conflicts and new threats posed \r\nby terrorist activities, extremism and intolerance. \r\nWe need to intensify efforts to achieve the peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts. In that context, strengthening \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations is essential, and I will be convening \r\na high-level thematic debate on that important issue. \r\nThe international community must stand united and \r\nmust resolve to combat such challenges, which threaten \r\nthe stability not only of individual States but of entire \r\nregions. We must speak with one voice to reiterate that \r\nthe killing of innocent civilians under any pretext is \r\nunacceptable.\r\nWe should continue to focus on the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly and the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. While some progress has been made towards \r\nmaking the General Assembly more effective and \r\nefficient, we need to do more. The need to reform the \r\nSecurity Council is urgent, as reflected in the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit Outcome document, which was adopted \r\nas resolution 60/1. As I said earlier, the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations were set up soon after the Second World \r\nWar by only 51 countries. We are now 193 countries. \r\nClearly, the need to change things is very pressing. \r\nWe need to find a way of making progress in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process, and I call upon \r\nMember States to redouble their efforts.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers for the general debate has been established \r\non the agreed basis that statements should be no longer \r\nthan 15 minutes to enable all the speakers to be heard \r\nat a given meeting. Within that time frame, I would like \r\nto appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nnormal speed so that interpretation in the six official \r\nUnited Nations languages may be provided properly.\r\nI would like also to draw attention to the decision \r\ntaken by the General Assembly at previous sessions \r\nthat the practice of expressing congratulations inside \r\nthe General Assembly Hall after a speech has been \r\ndelivered is strongly discouraged. In that connection, \r\nafter delivering their statements, speakers are invited to \r\nexit the Hall through room GA-200, located behind the \r\nrostrum, before returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees \r\nto proceed in the manner outlined during the general \r\ndebate of the sixty-ninth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Finally, I should like to draw to the \r\nattention of members to the fact that, during the general \r\ndebate, official photos of all the speakers are taken \r\nby the Department of Public Information. Members \r\ninterested in obtaining those photos are requested to \r\ncontact the Photo Library of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rousseff (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is a great \r\nsatisfaction for Brazil, which has the honour and \r\nprivilege of opening this debate, to have as the President \r\nof this session of the General Assembly a son of Africa. \r\nAs Brazilians we are united by ties of history, culture \r\nand friendship with the African continent, whose \r\nlegacy was and always will be decisive for my country’s \r\nnational identity.\r\nI open this general debate on the eve of elections \r\nin Brazil that will determine the President of the \r\nRepublic, State governors and a significant portion of \r\nour Congress. Those elections represent the celebration \r\nof a democracy we achieved almost 30 years ago, after \r\ntwo decades of dictatorial rule. Through democracy we \r\nalso advanced towards the country’s economic stability.\r\nDuring the past 12 years in particular, we have \r\nconsolidated those achievements by building an \r\ninclusive society based on equal opportunity. The great \r\ntransformation to which we are committed has resulted \r\nin a modern economy and a more egalitarian society. At \r\nthe same time it has required strong civic participation, \r\n14-54711 7/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nrespect for human rights and a sustainable vision of \r\ndevelopment. Lastly, it has also required an engagement \r\non the world stage characterized by a multilateral \r\napproach, respect for international law, the quest for \r\npeace and a culture of solidarity.\r\nA few days ago, the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations announced that \r\nBrazil is no longer on the World Hunger Map. That \r\ntransformation is the result of economic policies that \r\nhave generated 21 million jobs, raised the minimum \r\nwage and increased its purchasing power by 71 per cent \r\nin the past 12 years. Those policies have also reduced \r\ninequality. Since 2003, 36 million Brazilians have been \r\nlifted out of extreme poverty, 22 million of them during \r\nmy Administration alone. Social policies and income- \r\ntransfer programmes, coordinated within our plan for a \r\nBrazil without extreme poverty, have also contributed \r\nto those results. On the health-care front, we have been \r\nable to meet our target for reduced child mortality \r\nbefore the deadline set by the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.\r\nWe have also made access to basic primary and \r\nmiddle-school education universally available, and we \r\nare now pursuing the same goal for secondary education. \r\nWe are equally committed to enhancing the quality of \r\neducation by, inter alia, improving curriculums and \r\nraising the profile of teachers. Vocational education \r\nhas made strides, with the creation of hundreds of new \r\nschools and the professional training and development \r\nof 8 million young people over the past four years. \r\nThere has been an unprecedented expansion of higher \r\neducation, with the establishment of new publicly \r\nfunded universities and of scholarships and financial \r\naid that has given 3 million students access to private \r\nuniversities. Affirmative-action policies have enabled \r\npoor, black and indigenous students to enrol in \r\nuniversities on a massive scale.\r\nFinally, our efforts to tackle the challenges \r\nof building a knowledge-based society have led \r\nto the creation of a programme known as Science \r\nWithout Borders, which has sent more than 100,000 \r\nundergraduate and graduate students to the world’s \r\nbest universities. Through a presidential initiative, our \r\nNational Congress has enacted legislation allocating \r\nto education 75 per cent of the royalties earned from \r\npre-salt oil exploration and 50 per cent of the social \r\nfund generated by pre-salt oil revenues, with 25 per \r\ncent of pre-salt oil exploration royalties going to health \r\ncare. We will thus be able to transform finite resources \r\nsuch as oil and gas into permanent assets — education, \r\nscience and technology, and innovation. That will be \r\nour passport to the future.\r\nWe have not neglected fiscal discipline and \r\nmonetary stability, and we have striven to protect \r\nBrazil from external volatility. We were thus able to \r\novercome the challenges arising from the major global \r\neconomic crisis, triggered in 2008 by the collapse of \r\nLehman Brothers, which subsequently developed into \r\nnational sovereign debt crises affecting many countries. \r\nWe resisted its worst consequences — unemployment, \r\nwage depreciation, erosion of social rights and \r\nstalled investment. We followed through with income \r\ndistribution by stimulating growth and employment and \r\nmaintaining our investment in infrastructure. Brazil \r\njumped from the thirteenth- to the seventh-largest \r\neconomy in the world. Our per capita income more than \r\ntripled, and inequality fell sharply. In 2002, more than \r\nhalf of Brazil’s population was poor or living below the \r\npoverty line; today three out of every four Brazilians \r\nare firmly in the middle-class and upper-income \r\nranges. During the economic crisis, when hundreds of \r\nmillions around the world were left unemployed, Brazil \r\ncreated 12 million new jobs. In addition, we became \r\na primary destination for foreign investment, and we \r\nresumed our investment in infrastructure through \r\nstrong partnerships with the private sector.\r\nAll of those gains have occurred within the context \r\nof a sound fiscal environment. We have reduced our \r\nnet ratio of public debt to gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) from about 60 per cent to 35 per cent. Our gross \r\nexternal debt in relation to GDP fell from 42 per cent \r\nto 14 per cent. Our international reserves increased \r\ntenfold, making Brazil an international creditor. Our \r\nannual inflation rate has also remained within the \r\nmaximum and minimum range fixed by our current \r\nnational targets.\r\nAlthough we have managed to fend off the most \r\nharmful consequences of the global crisis, we have \r\nnonetheless been acutely affected by it in the past \r\nfew years, owing to the persistence all over the world \r\nof substantial economic difficulties that have had a \r\nnegative effect on our growth. Here I would like to \r\nreiterate what I said at the opening of last year’s general \r\ndebate (see A/68/PV.5). It is vital and urgent that we \r\nrestore the momentum of the global economy, which \r\nshould work to drive investment and international \r\ntrade and reduce inequalities between countries, and \r\nnot become a factor that ultimately slows economic \r\n8/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ndevelopment and income distribution in society as a \r\nwhole.\r\nRegarding international trade, there must be a \r\nunanimous commitment to an action plan leading to the \r\nconclusion of the Doha Round. It is also imperative that \r\nwe end the disparity between the growing importance \r\nof developing countries to the global economy and their \r\ninsufficient representation and participation in the \r\ndecision-making processes of international financial \r\ninstitutions such as the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank. The delay in expanding \r\ndeveloping countries’ voting rights in those institutions \r\nis unacceptable. The risk to those institutions is that \r\ncould lose their legitimacy and effectiveness.\r\nIn July Brazil had the pleasure of hosting the \r\nsixth Summit of the BRICS countries, namely, Brazil, \r\nRussia, India, China and South Africa. We welcomed \r\ntheir leaders in a fraternal and fruitful meeting that \r\npointed to important possibilities for the future. We \r\nsigned agreements establishing a new development \r\nbank and a contingent reserve arrangement. The bank \r\nwill cater to the infrastructure financing needs of the \r\nBRICS and other developing countries. The contingent \r\nreserve arrangement will protect them from financial \r\nvolatility. Each instrument will have a capital injection \r\nof $100 billion.\r\nThe current generation of world leaders — our \r\ngeneration — is also being called on to deal with significant \r\nchallenges to peace, collective security and the \r\nenvironment. We have been unable either to solve old \r\ndisputes or to prevent new threats. It is impossible to \r\neliminate the underlying causes of conflict through the \r\nuse of force. That has been made clear by the persistence \r\nof the Palestine question, the systematic massacre of \r\nthe Syrian people, the tragic national fragmentation of \r\nIraq, the serious insecurity in Libya, the conflicts in the \r\nSahel and the clashes in Ukraine. Instead of leading to \r\npeace, every military intervention has worsened those \r\nconflicts. We are witnessing the tragic proliferation \r\nof civilian victims and humanitarian disasters. We \r\ncannot allow such barbaric acts to increase and violate \r\nour ethical, moral and civilizational values. Nor can \r\nwe remain indifferent to the spread of the Ebola virus \r\nin West Africa. We therefore support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposal to establish a United Nations \r\nMission for Ebola Emergency Response. Brazil is \r\nsolidly in favour of it.\r\nThe Security Council has had some difficulties \r\nin promoting peaceful solutions to those conflicts. \r\nTo overcome such stalemates, a genuine reform of \r\nthe Council will be required, a process that has been \r\ndragging on for quite some time. The coming seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations, in 2015, appears to \r\nbe an occasion conducive to achieving the progress \r\nthat the situation currently calls for. I am quite certain \r\nthat we all understand the serious risks arising from \r\nparalysis and inaction in the Security Council. A more \r\nrepresentative and legitimate Security Council would \r\nalso be more effective.\r\nI wish to underscore that we cannot possibly remain \r\nindifferent to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, particularly \r\nafter the recent dramatic events in Gaza. We condemn \r\nthe disproportionate use of force that has strongly \r\nvictimized the civilian population, especially women \r\nand children. The conflict must be properly resolved, \r\nnot precariously managed, as has been the case up to \r\nnow. Effective negotiations between the parties must \r\nultimately lead to a two-State solution with Palestine \r\nand Israel living side by side in security within \r\ninternationally recognized borders.\r\nAmid so many conflict situations, Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean seek to face up to the main problem \r\nthat has marked our region for centuries. I am talking \r\nabout social inequality. Democratic roots have become \r\nstronger, and the demand for more just, inclusive and \r\nsustainable growth has grown ever stronger. Through \r\nthe Union of South American Nations, the Common \r\nMarket of the South, and the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, integration efforts \r\nhave made tremendous headway.\r\nClimate change is one of the greatest challenges of \r\nour times. To overcome that challenge, we need a sense \r\nof urgency, political courage and a keen understanding \r\nthat actors have to contribute according to the \r\nprinciples of equity and common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. The recent Climate Summit, which was \r\nconvened in a very timely manner by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, further invigorated negotiations at the level of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange.\r\nThe Brazilian Government will strive to ensure \r\nthat the outcome of the negotiations will lead to a \r\nbalanced, fair and effective agreement. Brazil has been \r\ndoing its part to face up to the challenge of climate \r\nchange. In 2009, during the Copenhagen Conference, \r\nwe committed to a voluntary reduction of 36 to 39 per \r\ncent of our projected emissions by 2020. Between 2010 \r\nand 2013, we avoided releasing into the atmosphere an \r\n14-54711 9/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\naverage of 650 million tons of carbon dioxide every \r\nyear. Throughout those years, we achieved the lowest \r\ndeforestation rates in our history. In the past decade, \r\nwe have reduced deforestation by 79 per cent, without \r\ngiving up our agenda of economic development and \r\nsocial inclusion.\r\nWe have therefore shown that it is possible to \r\ngrow, to include, to preserve and to protect. Such an \r\nachievement stems from the continuous and steadfast \r\ncommitment of the Brazilian Government, civil society \r\nand other public and private stakeholders. We hope \r\nthat developed countries, which have not only the \r\nlegal but also a political obligation to lead by example, \r\nwill unequivocally and concretely demonstrate their \r\ncommitment to combat this problem that affects us all.\r\nAt the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, we were proud to set \r\nthe foundations for a new development agenda, based \r\non sustainable development goals applicable to both \r\ndeveloping and developed nations. It will be crucial \r\nfor us to identify the means of implementation that \r\ncorrespond to the magnitude of the challenges that we \r\nhave committed ourselves to overcoming. We must be \r\nambitious when it comes to financing, cooperation, \r\nnational capacity-building and technology transfer, \r\nespecially to ensure that the least developed countries \r\nbenefit. Let me underscore, in that context, the need to \r\nestablish a mechanism for the development, transfer and \r\ndissemination of clean, environmentally sustainable \r\ntechnologies.\r\nIn addition to sustainable development and peace, \r\nthe international order that we seek to build must be \r\nanchored on fundamental values. Among those values, \r\nemphasis should be put on efforts to combat all forms \r\nof discrimination and exclusion. We have a clear-cut \r\ncommitment to the empowerment of women in the \r\nlabour market, liberal professions, entrepreneurship, \r\npolitical activity and access to education, among others. \r\nMy Administration has tirelessly fought violence \r\nagainst women in all its forms. We consider the twenty-\r\nfirst century to be the century of women.\r\nBy the same token, the promotion of racial equality \r\nseeks to compensate Brazilians of African descent for \r\nthe consequences of the centuries of slavery to which \r\nthey were subjected. Today, those Brazilians account \r\nfor more than half of our population. We owe them our \r\nrich and permanent legacy of cultural, religious and \r\nhuman wealth and values. For us, racial miscegenation \r\nis a matter of pride. Racism is not only a heinous and \r\nextremely serious crime, but it is also a scourge that we \r\nhave not hesitated to fight, punish and eradicate.\r\nThe same commitment that we have had to combat \r\nviolence against women and African Brazilians, we \r\nhave also had against homophobia. My country’s \r\nSupreme Court has recognized same-sex civil unions, \r\nthereby ensuring them the full range of civil rights \r\narising therefrom. We firmly believe in the dignity of \r\nall human beings and in the universal nature of their \r\nfundamental rights. Those rights must be protected \r\nfrom all double standards and all forms of politicization, \r\nboth domestically and internationally.\r\nYet another fundamental value is the respect for \r\npublic good. We all face a relentless fight against \r\ncorruption. History has shown that there is only one \r\ncorrect and efficient way to tackle corruption; that is \r\nby ending impunity, thereby strengthening institutions \r\nthat oversee, investigate and punish acts of corruption, \r\nmoney-laundering and other financial crimes. That is \r\na responsibility incumbent upon each Government, a \r\nresponsibility that Brazil has fulfilled by strengthening \r\nour institutions.\r\nIn Brazil, we have designed and built a Government \r\ntransparency portal website that gives citizens access \r\nto all information on Government spending within 24 \r\nhours after monies are spent. We have also adopted \r\na law on access to information, which allows all \r\nBrazilian citizens the right to access Government \r\ndata, except for that related to the country’s national \r\nsovereignty. We have strengthened and given autonomy \r\nto investigators as well as to those in charge of internal \r\nGovernment controls. We have passed laws that punish \r\nnot only those who actively engage in corruption but \r\nalso those who passively agree with acts of corruption. \r\nStrengthening those institutions is absolutely crucial \r\nfor strengthening open and democratic governance. \r\nBrazil’s recent re-election to the Executive Committee \r\nof the Open Government Partnership will also allow \r\nus to contribute to promoting more transparent \r\nGovernments worldwide.\r\nIt is essential that measures be taken to effectively \r\nprotect human rights, not only in the real world but \r\nalso in the virtual world, as stated in resolution 68/167 \r\non privacy in the digital age, adopted by the General \r\nAssembly in the past year. Brazil and Germany \r\npromoted an important discussion on the matter in \r\n2013. We intend to deepen that discussion during this \r\nsixty-ninth session. For our review of such matters, the \r\n2013 annual report of the Office of the United Nations \r\n10/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, published in \r\nMay 2014, can provide significant inputs. In September \r\n2013, I proposed from this rostrum (see A/68/PV.5) that \r\na civil framework be development for the governance \r\nand use of the Internet, a framework based on the \r\nprinciples of freedom of expression, privacy, network \r\nneutrality and cultural diversity. \r\nI am pleased to note that the international community \r\nhas, since then, mobilized its efforts to enhance the \r\ncurrent Internet governance architecture. Brazil’s \r\ninitiative to hold the Global Multistakeholder Meeting \r\non the Future of Internet Governance, NETmundial, in \r\nSão Paulo in April was an important step in the process. \r\nThe Meeting brought together stakeholders from \r\nvarious regions of the world and from multiple sectors. \r\nDiscussions were held on the principles that should be \r\nfollowed and the actions to be undertaken in order to \r\nensure that the Internet will continue to develop in an \r\nopen, democratic, free, multisectoral and multilateral \r\nmanner.\r\nThe United Nations and its Member States have \r\nbefore them today challenges of great magnitude, which \r\nshould be the priorities of this session of the General \r\nAssembly. The year 2015 must be a turning point. I am \r\ncertain that we will not shy away from fulfilling, with a \r\nsense of courage and insight, our lofty responsibilities \r\nto build an international order founded on the promotion \r\nof peace, sustainable development, poverty eradication \r\nand the reduction of inequality. Brazil stands ready and \r\nis fully determined to contribute to that end.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federative Republic \r\nof Brazil for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Barack Obama, President of the \r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Obama: We come together at a \r\ncrossroads between war and peace, between disorder \r\nand integration, between fear and hope. Around the \r\nglobe, there are signposts of progress. The shadow of \r\nthe Second World War that existed at the founding of \r\nthis institution has been lifted, and the prospect of war \r\nbetween major Powers reduced. The ranks of Member \r\nStates have more than tripled, and more people live \r\nunder Governments that they elected. Hundreds of \r\nmillions of human beings have been freed from the \r\nprison of poverty, with the proportion of those living \r\nin extreme poverty cut in half. And the world economy \r\ncontinues to strengthen after the worst financial crisis \r\nof our lives.\r\nToday, whether you live in downtown Manhattan or \r\nin my grandmother’s village more than 200 miles from \r\nNairobi, you can hold in your hand more information \r\nthan the world’s greatest libraries. Together, we have \r\nlearned how to cure disease and harness the power \r\nof the wind and the sun. The very existence of this \r\nOrganization is a unique achievement, with the people \r\nof the world committing to resolve their differences \r\npeacefully and to solve their problems together. I often \r\ntell young people in the United States that, despite \r\nthe headlines, this is the best time in human history \r\nto be born, for you are more likely than ever before to \r\nbe literate, to be healthy and to be free to pursue your \r\ndreams.\r\nAnd yet there is a pervasive unease in our world — a \r\nsense that the very forces that have brought us together \r\nhave created new dangers and made it difficult for any \r\nsingle nation to insulate itself from global forces. As we \r\ngather here, an outbreak of Ebola overwhelms public \r\nhealth systems in West Africa and threatens to move \r\nrapidly across borders. Russian aggression in Europe \r\nrecalls the days when large nations trampled small \r\nones in pursuit of territorial ambitions. The brutality \r\nof terrorists in Syria and Iraq forces us to look into the \r\nheart of darkness.\r\nEach of those problems demands urgent attention. \r\nBut they are also symptoms of a broader problem: \r\nthe failure of our international system to keep pace \r\nwith an interconnected world. We, collectively, have \r\nnot invested adequately in the public health capacity \r\nof developing countries. Too often, we have failed \r\nto enforce international norms when it has been \r\n14-54711 11/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\ninconvenient to do so. And we have not confronted \r\nforcefully enough the intolerance, sectarianism and \r\nhopelessness that feeds violent extremism in too many \r\nparts of the globe.\r\nFellow representatives, we come together as \r\nUnited Nations with a choice to make. We can renew \r\nthe international system that has enabled so much \r\nprogress, or we can allow ourselves to be pulled back \r\nby an undertow of instability. We can reaffirm our \r\ncollective responsibility to confront global problems, or \r\nbe swamped by more and more outbreaks of instability. \r\nAnd for America, the choice is clear — we choose hope \r\nover fear. We see the future not as something out of our \r\ncontrol, but as something we can shape for the better \r\nthrough concerted and collective effort. We reject \r\nfatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs. \r\nWe choose to work for the world as it should be, as our \r\nchildren deserve it to be.\r\nThere is much that must be done to meet the test \r\nof this moment. But today I would like to focus on \r\ntwo defining questions at the root of so many of our \r\nchallenges. Will the nations represented here today \r\nbe able to renew the purpose of the United Nations \r\nfounding, and will we come together to reject the cancer \r\nof violent extremism?\r\nFirst, all of us — big nations and small — must meet \r\nour responsibility to observe and enforce international \r\nnorms. We are here because others realized that we \r\ngain more from cooperation than from conquest. One \r\nhundred years ago, a World War claimed the lives of \r\nmany millions, proving that with the terrible power of \r\nmodern weaponry, the cause of empire ultimately leads \r\nto the graveyard. It would then take another World War \r\nto roll back the forces of fascism, the notions of racial \r\nsupremacy, and form the United Nations to ensure that \r\nno nation can subjugate its neighbours and claim their \r\nterritory.\r\nRecently, Russia’s actions in Ukraine have \r\nchallenged that post-war order. Here are the facts. After \r\nthe people of Ukraine mobilized popular protests and \r\ncalls for reform, their corrupt President f led. Against \r\nthe will of the Government in Kyiv, Crimea was annexed \r\nby Russia. Russia poured arms into eastern Ukraine, \r\nfuelling violent separatists and a conflict that has killed \r\nthousands. When a civilian airliner was shot down from \r\nareas that those proxy forces controlled, those forces \r\nrefused to allow access to the crash site for days. When \r\nUkraine started to reassert control over its territory, \r\nRussia gave up the pretence of merely supporting the \r\nseparatists and moved troops across the border.\r\nThat reflects a vision of a world in which might \r\nmakes right; a world in which one nation’s borders \r\ncan be redrawn by another and civilized people are \r\nnot allowed to recover the remains of their loved ones \r\nbecause of the truth that might be revealed.\r\nAmerica stands for something different. We believe \r\nthat right makes might, that bigger nations should not \r\nbe able to bully smaller ones and that people should \r\nbe able to choose their own future. Those are simple \r\ntruths, but they must be defended. America and our \r\nallies will support the people of Ukraine as they develop \r\ntheir democracy and economy. We will reinforce our \r\nNATO allies and uphold our commitment to collective \r\nself-defence. We will impose a cost on Russia for its \r\naggression, and we will counter falsehoods with the \r\ntruth. And we call upon others to join us on the right \r\nside of history, for while small gains can be won at the \r\nbarrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if \r\nenough voices support the freedom of nations and the \r\nright of peoples to make their own decisions.\r\nMoreover, a different path is available — the path of \r\ndiplomacy and peace, and the ideals that this institution \r\nis designed to uphold. The recent ceasefire agreement in \r\nUkraine offers an opening to achieve those objectives. \r\nIf Russia takes that path — a path that for stretches of \r\nthe post-Cold War period resulted in prosperity for the \r\nRussian people — then we will lift our sanctions and \r\nwelcome Russia’s role in addressing common challenges. \r\nThat is, after all, what the United States and Russia \r\nhave been able to do in past years — from reducing our \r\nnuclear stockpiles to meeting our obligations under the \r\nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to cooperating to \r\nremove and destroy Syria’s declared chemical weapons. \r\nThat is the kind of cooperation we are prepared to \r\npursue again, if Russia changes course.\r\nThat speaks to a central question of our global \r\nage — will we solve our problems together in a spirit of \r\nmutual interest and mutual respect, or will we descend \r\ninto the destructive rivalries of the past? When nations \r\nfind common ground — not simply based on power, but \r\non principle — then we can make enormous progress. \r\nAnd I stand before the Assembly today committed to \r\ninvesting American strength and to working with all \r\nnations to address the problems we face in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nAs we speak, America is deploying our doctors and \r\nscientists, supported by our military, to help contain \r\nthe outbreak of Ebola and pursue new treatments. But \r\nwe need a broader effort to stop a disease that could \r\nkill hundreds of thousands, inflict horrific suffering, \r\n12/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ndestabilize economies and move rapidly across borders. \r\nIt is easy to see that problem as a distant problem, \r\nuntil it is not. And that is why we will continue to \r\nmobilize other countries to join us in making concrete \r\ncommitments, significant commitments to fight the \r\noutbreak and enhance our system of global health \r\nsecurity for the long term.\r\nAmerica is pursuing a diplomatic resolution to the \r\nIranian nuclear issue, as part of our commitment to stop \r\nthe spread of nuclear weapons and pursue the peace \r\nand security of a world without them. But that can take \r\nplace only if Iran seizes this historic opportunity. My \r\nmessage to Iran’s leaders and people has been simple \r\nand consistent: do not let this opportunity pass. We can \r\nreach a solution that meets Iran’s energy needs while \r\nassuring the world that Iran’s nuclear programme is \r\npeaceful.\r\nAmerica is and will continue to be a Pacific \r\nPower, promoting peace, stability, and the free f low \r\nof commerce among nations. But we will insist that \r\nall nations abide by the rules of the road and resolve \r\ntheir territorial disputes peacefully, consistent with \r\ninternational law. That is how the Asia-Pacific region \r\nhas grown. And that is the only way to protect the \r\nprogress going forward.\r\nAmerica is committed to a development agenda that \r\neradicates extreme poverty by 2030. We will do our part \r\nto help people feed themselves, power their economies \r\nand care for their sick. If the world acts together, we \r\ncan make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of \r\nopportunity and dignity.\r\nAmerica is pursuing ambitious reductions in \r\nits carbon emissions, and we have increased our \r\ninvestments in clean energy. We will do our part and \r\nhelp developing nations do theirs. But the science tells \r\nus that we can succeed in combating climate change \r\nonly if we are joined in that effort by every other nation, \r\nby every major Power. That is how we can protect the \r\nplanet for our children and our grandchildren.\r\nIn other words, on issue after issue, we cannot rely \r\non a rule book written for a different century. If we lift \r\nour eyes beyond our borders, if we think globally and \r\nif we act cooperatively, we can shape the course of this \r\ncentury as our predecessors shaped the post-World War \r\nTwo age.\r\nBut as we look to the future, one issue risks starting \r\na cycle of conflict that could derail so much progress. \r\nThat is the cancer of violent extremism, which has \r\nravaged so many parts of the Muslim world. Of course, \r\nterrorism is not new. Speaking before the Assembly, \r\nPresident Kennedy put it well:\r\n“Terror is not a new weapon. Throughout \r\nhistory it has been used by those who could not \r\nprevail either by persuasion or by example.” \r\n(A/PV.1013, para. 96)\r\nIn the twentieth century, terror was used by all \r\nmanner of groups who failed to come to power through \r\npublic support. But in this century, we have faced a \r\nmore lethal and ideological brand of terrorists who have \r\nperverted one of the world’s great religions. With access \r\nto technology that allows small groups to do great harm, \r\nthey have embraced a nightmarish vision that would \r\ndivide the world into adherents and infidels — killing \r\nas many innocent civilians as possible and employing \r\nthe most brutal methods to intimidate people within \r\ntheir communities.\r\nI have made it clear that America will not base its \r\nentire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Instead, \r\nwe have waged a focused campaign against Al-Qaida \r\nand its associated forces — taking out their leaders \r\nand denying them the safe havens they rely on. At the \r\nsame time, we have reaffirmed again and again that the \r\nUnited States is not and never will be at war with Islam. \r\nIslam teaches peace. Muslims the world over aspire to \r\nlive with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it \r\ncomes to America and Islam, there is no us and them, \r\nthere is only us, because millions of Muslim Americans \r\nare part of the fabric of our country.\r\nSo we reject any suggestion of a clash of \r\ncivilizations. Belief in permanent religious war is the \r\nmisguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or \r\ncreate anything and therefore peddle only fanaticism \r\nand hate. And it is no exaggeration to say that the future \r\nof humankind depends on our uniting against those \r\nwho would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or \r\nsect, race or religion.\r\nBut this is not simply a matter of words. Collectively, \r\nwe must take concrete steps to address the danger posed \r\nby religiously motivated fanatics and the trends that \r\nfuel their recruitment. Moreover, the campaign against \r\nextremism goes beyond a narrow security challenge. \r\nFor while we have worked methodically to degrade \r\nAl-Qaida at its core and have supported a transition to \r\na sovereign Afghan Government, extremist ideology \r\nhas shifted to other places, particularly in the Middle \r\nEast and North Africa, where a quarter of the young \r\n14-54711 13/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\npeople have no job, where food and water could grow \r\nscarce, and where corruption is rampant and sectarian \r\nconflicts have become increasingly hard to contain.\r\nAs an international community, we must meet this \r\nchallenge with a focus on four areas. First, the terrorist \r\ngroup known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \r\n(ISIL) must be degraded and ultimately destroyed. It \r\nhas terrorized all those whom it has come across in Iraq \r\nand Syria. Mothers, sisters and daughters have been \r\nsubjected to rape as a weapon of war. Innocent children \r\nhave been gunned down. Bodies have been dumped into \r\nmass graves. Religious minorities have been starved to \r\ndeath. In the most horrific crimes imaginable, innocent \r\nhuman beings have been beheaded, with videos of \r\nthe atrocity distributed to shock the conscience of the \r\nworld.\r\nNo god condones such terror. No grievance \r\njustifies such actions. There can be no reasoning or \r\nnegotiation with that brand of evil. The only language \r\nunderstood by killers of that kind is the language of \r\nforce. So the United States of America will work with \r\na broad coalition to dismantle that network of death. In \r\nthis effort, we do not act alone, nor do we intend to send \r\nUnited States troops to occupy foreign lands. Instead, \r\nwe will support Iraqis and Syrians fighting to reclaim \r\ntheir communities. We will use our military might to \r\nroll back ISIL in a campaign of air strikes. We will train \r\nand equip forces fighting those terrorists on the ground. \r\nWe will work to cut off their financing and stop the f low \r\nof fighters into and out of the region. And more than \r\n40 nations have already offered to join the coalition. \r\nToday, I ask the world to join in this effort. Those who \r\nhave joined ISIL should leave the battlefield while they \r\ncan. Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause \r\nwill find that they are increasingly alone. For we will \r\nnot succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that \r\nthe future belongs to those who build, not to those who \r\ndestroy. So that is an immediate challenge, the first one \r\nwe must meet.\r\nThe second challenge is that it is time for the \r\nworld, especially Muslim communities, to explicitly, \r\nforcefully and consistently reject the ideology of \r\norganizations such as Al-Qaida and ISIL. It is one of \r\nthe tasks of all great religions to accommodate devout \r\nfaith with a modern, multicultural world. No children \r\nare born hating, and no children anywhere should be \r\neducated to hate other people. There should be no \r\nfurther tolerance of so-called clerics who call on people \r\nto harm innocents because they are Jewish or Christian \r\nor Muslim. It is time for a new compact among the \r\ncivilized peoples of this world to eradicate war at its \r\nmost fundamental source, and that is the corruption of \r\nyoung minds by violent ideology.\r\nThat means cutting off the funding that fuels such \r\nhatred. It is time to end the hypocrisy of those who \r\naccumulate wealth through the global economy and \r\nthen siphon funds to those who teach children to tear \r\nit down. That means contesting the space that terrorists \r\noccupy, including the Internet and social media. Their \r\npropaganda has coerced young people to travel abroad \r\nto fight their wars and has turned students — young \r\npeople full of potential — into suicide bombers. We \r\nmust offer an alternative vision. That means bringing \r\npeople of different faiths together. All religions have \r\nbeen attacked by extremists from within at some point, \r\nand all people of faith have a responsibility to lift up the \r\nvalue at the heart of all great religions. Do unto your \r\nneighbour as you would do — as you would have others \r\ndo — unto yourself.\r\nThe ideology of ISIL or Al-Qaida or Boko \r\nHaram will wilt and die if it is consistently exposed \r\nand confronted and refuted in the light of day. Look \r\nat the new Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim \r\nSocieties, whose purpose Sheikh Abdallah Bin Bayyah \r\nhas described as “We must declare war on war, so \r\nthe outcome will be peace upon peace”. Look at the \r\nyoung British Muslims who have responded to terrorist \r\npropaganda by starting the #notinmyname campaign, \r\ndeclaring that ISIL is hiding behind a false Islam. Look \r\nat the Christian and Muslim leaders who came together \r\nin the Central African Republic to reject violence; listen \r\nto the imam there who said that, while politics may try \r\nto divide the religious in that country, religion should \r\nnot be a cause of hate, war, or strife.\r\nLater today, the Security Council will adopt a \r\nresolution that underscores the responsibility of States \r\nto counter violent extremism. But resolutions must \r\nbe followed by tangible commitments, so that we are \r\naccountable when we fall short. Next year, we should \r\nall be prepared to announce the concrete steps that \r\nwe have taken to counter extremist ideologies in our \r\nown countries — by getting intolerance out of schools, \r\nstopping radicalization before it spreads and promoting \r\ninstitutions and programmes that build new bridges of \r\nunderstanding.\r\nThirdly, we must address the cycle of conflict, \r\nespecially sectarian conflict, that creates the conditions \r\nthat terrorists prey upon. There is nothing new about \r\n14/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nwars within religions. Christianity endured centuries of \r\nvicious sectarian conflict. Today it is violence within \r\nMuslim communities that has become the source \r\nof so much human misery. It is time to acknowledge \r\nthe destruction wrought by proxy wars and terror \r\ncampaigns between Sunni and Shia across the Middle \r\nEast. And it is time that political, civic and religious \r\nleaders rejected sectarian strife. So let us be clear. This \r\nis a fight that no one is winning. A brutal civil war in \r\nSyria has already killed nearly 200,000 people and has \r\ndisplaced millions. Iraq has come perilously close to \r\nplunging back into the abyss. The conflict has created \r\na fertile recruiting ground for terrorists, who inevitably \r\nexport such violence.\r\nThe good news is that we also see signs that the tide \r\ncan be reversed. We have a new, inclusive Government \r\nin Baghdad and a new Iraqi Prime Minister welcomed \r\nby his neighbours; we see Lebanese factions that reject \r\nthose who try to provoke war. Such steps must be followed \r\nby a broader truce. Nowhere is that more necessary \r\nthan in Syria. Together with our partners, America is \r\ntraining and equipping the Syrian opposition to be a \r\ncounterweight to the terrorists of ISIL and the brutality \r\nof the Al-Assad regime. But the only lasting solution \r\nto Syria’s civil war is political — an inclusive political \r\ntransition that responds to the legitimate aspirations of \r\nall Syrian citizens, regardless of ethnicity, regardless \r\nof creed.\r\nCynics may argue that such an outcome can never \r\ncome to pass. But there is no other way for the madness \r\nin Syria to end, whether one year from now or 10. And it \r\npoints to the fact that it is time for a broader negotiation \r\nin the region, in which major Powers address their \r\ndifferences directly, honestly and peacefully across \r\nthe table from one another, rather than through gun-\r\nwielding proxies. I can promise the international \r\ncommunity that America will remain engaged in the \r\nregion, and we are prepared to engage in that effort.\r\nMy fourth and final point is a simple one. The \r\ncountries of the Arab and Muslim world must focus on \r\nthe extraordinary potential of their people, especially \r\nthe youth. And here I would like to speak directly to \r\nyoung people across the Muslim world. You come \r\nfrom a great tradition that stands for education, not \r\nignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of \r\nlife, not murder. Those who call you away from that \r\npath are betraying that tradition, not defending it. You \r\nhave demonstrated that when young people have the \r\ntools to succeed — good schools, education in math \r\nand science, an economy that nurtures creativity and \r\nentrepreneurship — then societies will f lourish. So, \r\nAmerica will partner with those who promote that \r\nvision.\r\nWhere women are full participants in a country’s \r\npolitics or economy, societies are more likely to \r\nsucceed. And that is why we support the participation of \r\nwomen in parliaments and peace processes, schools and \r\nthe economy. If young people live in places where the \r\nonly option is between the dictates of a State or the lure \r\nof an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism \r\nstrategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society \r\nis allowed to f lourish — where people can express their \r\nviews and organize peacefully for a better life — then \r\nyou dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.\r\nAnd such positive change need not come at the \r\nexpense of tradition and faith. We see that in Iraq, where \r\na young man started a library for his peers. “We link \r\nIraq’s heritage to their hearts”, he said, and “give them \r\na reason to stay”. We see it in Tunisia, where secular \r\nand Islamist parties worked together through a political \r\nprocess to produce a new constitution. We see it in \r\nSenegal, where civil society thrives alongside a strong \r\ndemocratic Government. We see it in Malaysia, where \r\nvibrant entrepreneurship is propelling a former colony \r\ninto the ranks of advanced economies. And we see it in \r\nIndonesia, where what began as a violent transition has \r\nevolved into a genuine democracy.\r\nUltimately the task of rejecting sectarianism and \r\nrejecting extremism is a generational one, and a task \r\nfor the people of the Middle East themselves. No \r\nexternal power can bring about a transformation of \r\nhearts and minds. But America will be a respectful \r\nand constructive partner. We will neither tolerate \r\nterrorist safe havens nor act as an occupying Power. \r\nWe will take action against threats to our security and \r\nour allies, while building an architecture of counter-\r\nterrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift \r\nup those who counter extremist ideologies and who \r\nseek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand \r\nour programmes to support entrepreneurship and civil \r\nsociety, education and youth, because ultimately those \r\ninvestments are the best antidote to violence.\r\nWe recognize as well that leadership will be \r\nnecessary to address the conflict between Palestinians \r\nand Israelis. As bleak as the landscape appears, America \r\nwill not give up on the pursuit of peace. Understand that \r\nthe situation in Iraq and Syria and Libya should cure \r\nanybody of the illusion that the Arab-Israeli conflict \r\n14-54711 15/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nis the main source of problems in the region. For far \r\ntoo long that has been used as an excuse to distract \r\npeople from problems at home. The violence engulfing \r\nthe region today has made too many Israelis ready to \r\nabandon the hard work of peace. And that is something \r\nworthy of reflection within Israel. Because let us be \r\nclear: the status quo in the West Bank and Gaza is not \r\nsustainable. We cannot afford to turn away from that \r\neffort — not when rockets are fired at innocent Israelis, \r\nor when the lives of so many Palestinian children are \r\ntaken from us in Gaza. So long as I am President, we \r\nwill stand up for the principle that Israelis, Palestinians, \r\nthe region and the world will be more just and more \r\nsafe with two States living side by side, in peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nSo this is what America is prepared to do: take \r\naction against immediate threats, while pursuing a \r\nworld in which the need for such action is diminished. \r\nThe United States will never shy away from defending \r\nour interests, but we will also not shy away from the \r\npromise of this institution and its Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights — the notion that peace is not merely \r\nthe absence of war, but the presence of a better life.\r\nI realize that America’s critics will be quick to point \r\nout that at times we too have failed to live up to our \r\nideals and that America has plenty of problems within \r\nits own borders. That is true. In a summer marked by \r\ninstability in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, I \r\nknow the world also took notice of the small American \r\ncity of Ferguson, Missouri, where a young man was \r\nkilled and a community was divided. So, yes, we have \r\nour own racial and ethnic tensions. And, like every \r\ncountry, we continually wrestle with how to reconcile \r\nthe vast changes wrought by globalization and greater \r\ndiversity with the traditions that we hold dear.\r\nBut we welcome the scrutiny of the world, because \r\nwhat you see in America is a country that has steadily \r\nworked to address our problems, to make our union \r\nmore perfect, to bridge the divides that existed at the \r\nfounding of this nation. America is not the same as it \r\nwas 100 years ago or 50 years ago or even a decade ago. \r\nWe fight for our ideals and we are willing to criticize \r\nourselves when we fall short. We hold our leaders \r\naccountable and insist on a free press and an independent \r\njudiciary. We address our differences in the open space \r\nof democracy, with respect for the rule of law, with a \r\nplace for people of every race and every religion and \r\nwith an unyielding belief in the ability of individual \r\nmen and women to change their communities and their \r\ncircumstances and their countries for the better.\r\nAfter nearly six years as President, I believe that that \r\npromise can help light the world. I have seen a longing \r\nfor positive change — for peace and for freedom and for \r\nopportunity and for an end to bigotry — in the eyes of \r\nyoung people whom I have met around the globe. They \r\nremind me that no matter who you are or where you \r\ncome from or what you look like or what God you pray \r\nto or whom you love, there is something fundamental \r\nthat we all share. \r\nEleanor Roosevelt, a champion of the United \r\nNations and America’s role in it, once asked, \r\n“Where, after all, do universal human rights \r\nbegin? In small places, close to home — so close \r\nand so small that they cannot be seen on any maps \r\nof the world. Yet they are the world of the individual \r\nperson; the neighbourhood he lives in; the school or \r\ncollege he attends; the factory, farm or office where \r\nhe works.”\r\nAround the world, young people are moving forward, \r\nhungry for a better world. Around the world, in small \r\nplaces, they are overcoming hatred and bigotry and \r\nsectarianism. And they are learning to respect each \r\nother, despite differences.\r\nThe people of the world now look to us, here, to \r\nbe as decent and dignified and courageous as they are \r\ntrying to be in their daily lives. And at this crossroads, \r\nI can promise the Assembly that the United States \r\nof America will not be distracted or deterred from \r\nwhat must be done. We are heirs to a proud legacy of \r\nfreedom, and we are prepared to do what is necessary \r\nto secure that legacy for generations to come. I ask \r\nthat the Assembly join us in this common mission, for \r\ntoday’s children and tomorrow’s.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n16/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of \r\nthe Republic of Uganda, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Museveni: First of all, I thank the \r\nGeneral Assembly for electing His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. \r\nAs the Assembly knows, the United Nations system \r\nneeds reform to reflect the new needs and realities in the \r\nworld today. Uganda will use the time of its presidency \r\nto make a small contribution towards the reform of \r\nthe United Nations and its organs by pushing for the \r\nAfrican agenda on that issue. Those reforms, as will be \r\nagreed by all of us, will strengthen the United Nations, \r\nnot otherwise.\r\nAfrica, Uganda included, is at long last emerging \r\nfrom the long night of decline that the continent has \r\nbeen through in the last 500 years — ever since 1472, \r\nwhen the Portuguese started encroaching on the African \r\ncoastline. Those 500 years witnessed great traumas \r\ninflicted on the African continent, including the slave \r\ntrade, colonialism, neocolonialism, plunder, human \r\nhaemorrhage and, in some cases, even genocide. Those \r\ntraumas resulted in the haemorrhage of the population \r\nand the depopulation of the African continent to \r\nthe extent that by 1900 the population of the whole \r\nof Africa was only 133 million people, while that of \r\nChina, which is only one quarter of the land area of \r\nAfrica, was 489,000 million people. In other words, by \r\n1990, the population of the whole of Africa was only a \r\nquarter of that of China, in a land area four times larger. \r\nSuch traumas were possible in Africa owing not \r\nonly to internal weaknesses but also external factors. \r\nForeign aggression caused serious distortions in \r\nAfrican societies. There was, for instance, the very-\r\nwell-organized Kingdom of Kongo on the Atlantic \r\ncoast at the time the first Portuguese explorer, Diego \r\nCão, arrived there in 1483. The Kingdom covered parts \r\nof northern Angola, Cabinda, parts of the Republic \r\nof Congo and the western parts of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. As a consequence of the actions \r\nof colonialism, that polity, that Kingdom, declined and \r\ndisintegrated. \r\nIt is only now that the modern countries of that \r\narea are regenerating that portion of Africa. It is those \r\ndistortions and the original endogenous weaknesses of \r\nAfrica that the present generation of African leaders \r\nhave been addressing. In many African countries, \r\npositive results are beginning to manifest themselves. \r\nThe middle class in Africa is now of the magnitude of \r\n313 million people, and that has boosted the purchasing \r\npower of Africa to $2.5 trillion. That purchasing power \r\nis growing at the rate of 3.2 per cent per annum. That \r\ngrowth and expansion of the African gross domestic \r\nproduct and purchasing power has happened despite \r\ninadequate roads, inadequate railways, inadequate \r\nelectricity, and so on. Once those strategic bottlenecks \r\nare addressed, the sky will be the limit as far as Africa’s \r\npotential is concerned. \r\nOne bottleneck that has bedevilled Africa has been \r\nthe espousing of the pseudo-ideology of religious or \r\ntribal sectarianism, as well as chauvinism vis-à-vis \r\nwomen. When President Obama was walking out, I met \r\nhim at the door and told him that he had copied some of \r\nmy statement. That pseudo-ideology has fuelled most \r\nof the conflicts in Africa. We are also witnessing the \r\nsame pseudo-ideology causing havoc in the Middle East \r\nand North Africa. When uninformed outsiders link up \r\nwith those pseudo-ideologists, the permutation is most \r\ntragic. Sectarian ideology is pseudo and bankrupt \r\nbecause it is at variance with the people’s real interests \r\nof symbiosis and the exchange of goods and services, \r\nas well as integration for mutual benefit. Only parasites \r\nrevel in such schemes. That pseudo-ideology should be \r\nbanished and treated with the contempt that it deserves.\r\nWith regard to socioeconomic transformation, \r\nUganda is busy building hard-surface roads, electricity \r\nnetworks, railways, information and communication \r\ntechnology networks, a universal education system \r\nand a pan-Ugandan health-care system. Together with \r\nour neighbours, we have integrated our markets in the \r\nEast African Community and the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa. We also partner with \r\nothers on common security solutions. Africa and the \r\nindividual African countries are therefore becoming \r\nmore credible partners with all serious actors beyond \r\nour shores. \r\nUganda needs and welcomes investment, trade \r\naccess, tourists and, in some cases, security partnerships \r\nthat are approved by the African Union with our \r\npartners in the world, many of whom are Members of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Uganda \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\n14-54711 17/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAddress by His Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of Spain \r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Majesty the King of Spain. \r\nHis Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of Spain, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nMajesty Don Felipe VI, King of Spain, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Felipe (spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour \r\nand privilege to address the General Assembly as the \r\nKing of Spain at the start of my reign.\r\nI appear before the Assembly to share with the \r\ninternational community my country’s commitment \r\nto the universal principles and values that best define \r\nhumanity. Today I have the pleasure to present what \r\nSpain — renewed but remaining true to itself and to \r\nits international commitments — can offer for peace, \r\nliberty, justice and human rights in all nations and for \r\nall persons, along with well-being and prosperity.\r\nAs a nation with ancient roots and a clear global \r\ncalling, Spain has contributed intensely and decisively \r\nto shaping world history. Let us recall that Spain was \r\npresent at the genesis of globalization and of international \r\nlaw, as well as of medieval parliamentarianism and \r\ncontemporary liberal democracy. With that perspective \r\nof centuries, we see clearly that our best contributions \r\ncome about when we move forward while opening up \r\nto the world.\r\nSincerely, despite our problems, I see Spanish \r\nsociety today as exemplary in its commitment to human \r\ndignity, in solidarity with the most marginalized. \r\nSpaniards harbour a profound sense of equality. They \r\nreject fanaticism, violence and intolerance and love \r\npeace. Spanish society is culturally and linguistically \r\ndiverse, capable of overcoming difficulties responsibly \r\nand with integrity while demanding integrity and \r\nexcellence as civic values intrinsic to democracy. Spain \r\nis a strong, generous and vigorous country, and I feel \r\ntruly proud of it.\r\nTherefore, today we Spaniards look to the future \r\nwith a firm will to share and to help to build a better \r\nreality for all peoples. Our foundations are solid, forged \r\nover centuries and strengthened especially in recent \r\ndecades. The commitments Spain has made with the \r\nrest of the international community are established on \r\nthose foundations.\r\nDemocracy is today the essential guide of our \r\ncollective coexistence. It will soon be four decades \r\nsince the beginning of Spain’s political transition, \r\nwhich allowed us to move from a dictatorship to a \r\npolitical system based on freedoms and rights and \r\nmarked by a desire for historical reconciliation and a \r\ntrue spirit of harmony. Allow me, therefore, to lay claim \r\nSpain’s political masterpiece with pride and emotion, \r\nan example for many in the world. We Spaniards have \r\nbuilt a social and democratic order based on the rule \r\nof law that protects all citizens and Spain’s various \r\nterritories in their political, geographic, cultural and \r\nlinguistic diversity. Thus Spain’s firm commitment \r\nto promoting and defending democratic values in the \r\nworld can always be counted on.\r\nWithout forgetting the impact of the crisis, Spain’s \r\neconomic development, particularly since the second \r\nhalf of the past century, has placed our economy among \r\nthe first in the world and among the most open and \r\ncompetitive. Today we have achieved global leadership \r\nrankings in various sectors with a high added value \r\nand significant social impact. Bearing that in mind, \r\nSpain strongly supports a global and sustainable way \r\nof economic development that makes possible material \r\nprogress and well-being, that generates employment \r\nand protects individuals and their social rights, a \r\nsustainable development model respectful of the \r\nenvironment, respecting international norms and with \r\nhigh, ethical economic values.\r\nSpain has always been a major cultural Power. \r\nWe understand that in all societies, culture shapes our \r\nidentity and is a source of material and non-material \r\nwealth. The strength of Spanish, a universal language \r\nshared by dozens of countries and hundreds of millions \r\nof people on all continents, decisively contributes to \r\nguaranteeing greater cultural and linguistic diversity in \r\nthe international arena. That is clearly an objective of \r\nthe human community, so widely diverse, represented \r\nhere. The Spanish language must therefore fully \r\nassume its formal position as an official language of \r\nthe United Nations and as a working language that is \r\nfully used and represented. Given the scope and depth \r\nof our cultural base, we affirm Spain’s commitment \r\nto defending cultural diversity in all of its aspects and \r\nmanifestations.\r\n18/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nSpain’s history and privileged geographic position \r\nat a crossroads of continents, seas and civilizations \r\nhave led it to develop a solid, universal perspective \r\nand a special connection to some regions in the world. \r\nAmong them, Europe represents an obvious dimension. \r\nThe process of continental integration around the \r\nEuropean Union today is part of the national project of \r\nthe Kingdom of Spain. We call for a Europe of greater \r\nunity and cohesiveness that preserves and extends the \r\ndemocratic and civic values that inspired its creation \r\nand that works to guarantee the prosperity of all of its \r\ncitizens. We also defend a Europe that is marked by \r\nstrength and solidarity that generously and effectively \r\ncontributes to the peaceful progress of all regions of \r\nthe world.\r\nDue to its history and culture, the Ibero-American \r\ncommunity of nations is a substantial part of our \r\ncollective identity and represents for us a true \r\nbrotherhood. That sentiment extends to other areas, \r\nthanks to the cultural, historic and linguistic \r\nconnections that we also maintain with other nations \r\nand peoples in the rest of the Americas, in Africa, Asia \r\nand Oceania.\r\nThe Mediterranean, with its northern and southern \r\nshores, together with the Middle East and the entire \r\nArab world, are areas very close to Spain, not only \r\ngeographically, but also culturally and emotionally. \r\nThat is why we affirm our will and interest in \r\ncontributing to the stability of the region, as something \r\nfundamental for achieving peace in the world. It is a \r\nregion in which some societies suffer the scourge of an \r\nintolerable barbarism, a criminal and atrocious violence \r\nthat threatens all societies of the planet and the very \r\nvalues of universal human civilization.\r\nSpain’s global vocation and its commitments in \r\ndemocratic, economic and cultural matters that I have \r\njust mentioned are summarized by its full commitment \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations, on behalf of which \r\nwe are convened here. The Charter represents one of \r\nthe greatest achievements of humankind; we must \r\ntherefore preserve, respect and enforce it. Thus Spain \r\nfirmly believes in the United Nations and its multilateral \r\nmechanisms for preserving international peace and \r\nsecurity and for contributing to the development of \r\nsocieties.\r\nWe live in times marked by a proliferation of \r\nconflicts, some of which are especially devastating and \r\nhave indiscriminate impacts on civilians. Our primary \r\nobjective must be to prevent war, and when we fail, we \r\nmust protect and assist the innocent and the injured. \r\nWe must never relent in our efforts to resolve conflict \r\nthrough diplomacy and all of the instruments bestowed \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations. Above all, we \r\nmust not lose hope, and we must remember that in spite \r\nof everything, the longing for harmony can and must \r\nprevail over even the most entrenched hatreds.\r\nA tapestry version of Guernica — a work by the \r\nuniversal Spaniard, Pablo Picasso — hangs outside the \r\nentrance to the Security Council Chamber. The scene \r\ndepicted in this art icon still stirs our conscience and \r\nreminds us of the fatal consequences of our inability to \r\nprevent and resolve conflicts that aff lict us all. It is a \r\nmistake to think that wars or man-made disasters affect \r\nonly one community or one region without any impact \r\non the others. When barbarism triumphs in one part of \r\nthe world, no one is beyond its reach; we are all victims.\r\nBut armed conflicts are not the only threats to the \r\ninternational community. Evil takes many forms and \r\ntheir victims have many faces: every child caught in \r\na crisis situation or in violence, every woman who is \r\nmolested or whose rights are limited simply because \r\nshe is a woman, every patient who dies for lack of \r\nmedicine or every abandoned elderly person, every \r\nfamily without food and without hope because of an \r\nunjust distribution of wealth, every journalist murdered \r\nfor doing his or her duty to inform — all of these are \r\nso many appeals to our conscience and to our sense of \r\nduty, and so many calls to action.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly can count \r\non Spain as we confront, together and in the framework \r\nof international law, those who seek to destroy, through \r\ntheir intolerance, violence or sectarianism, the values \r\nand principles that underlie our United Nations. Spain \r\nhas always demonstrated its unconditional support for \r\nthe United Nations system and its active responsibility \r\nwith regard to the principles that we all recognize in \r\nthis Assembly: freedom, justice, equality, national \r\nsovereignty, independence and the integrity of States. \r\nSpain will continue to assume, as it has, its full \r\nresponsibilities as a Member of United Nations.\r\nAgainst this background, Spain is taking another \r\nstep forward as a candidate for a non-permanent seat \r\non the Security Council for the 2015-2016 biennium. \r\nOur candidacy is an integral part of my country’s solid \r\ncommitment to serve the international community \r\nmore, and to serve it better. That is what we have done \r\n14-54711 19/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nin the Security Council once every decade over the past \r\n40 years, because the Assembly has trusted us. I only \r\nask that that trust be renewed.\r\nIn the past 25 years, 130,000 members of the \r\nSpanish armed forces have participated in peacekeeping \r\noperations and humanitarian aid missions in all regions \r\nof the world. They have been — and, above all, have \r\nfelt — part of a great collective effort to which many \r\nof the countries represented here have contributed. \r\nSimilarly, in recent decades Spain has consolidated its \r\nstatus as one of the leading contributors to development \r\ncooperation. There is no lasting peace without lasting \r\nsecurity, without sustainable development. There is \r\nno sustainable development without greater solidarity, \r\nboth among and within nations. Furthermore, \r\ndevelopment must be accompanied by policies of \r\ninclusion that envisage the full equality of women and \r\ntheir incorporation in all spheres of political, social and \r\neconomic life.\r\nAs we can see, Spain has a spirit of solidarity. In \r\nthe past 14 years, my compatriots have contributed \r\n$30 billion to global development. Of this contribution, \r\nnearly $1 billion has been earmarked for achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, through a fund set up \r\nby Spain and co-led by the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme. That is the largest contribution made by a \r\nsingle country. Specifically, one of the most important \r\ntasks of the General Assembly at this session will be to \r\nfinalize the negotiations for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and to establish the sustainable development \r\ngoals. Here, too, Spain has taken a step forward by \r\ncreating the first fund that is already functioning for \r\nthese sustainable development goals.\r\nTo a large extent, achieving sustainability involves \r\nfighting the harmful effects of climate change. The \r\nClimate Summit held yesterday and the recent Third \r\nInternational Conference on Small Island Developing \r\nStates, held in Samoa — whose organization Spain \r\ncontributed to — have raised our awareness even \r\nfurther on this issue. They also enable us to improve \r\nour response and resilience in the face of restricted \r\nsituations, especially as regards the most vulnerable \r\nStates whose very survival is at risk.\r\nThe sustainable development goals that we have \r\nset for ourselves are within our reach. Again, there \r\nare reasons for hope. I am thinking in particular of the \r\nprogress made in Africa, a continent that is so close \r\nto Spain and where new examples of innovation and \r\ncreativity are found everywhere. Africa is a continent \r\nof the present and future, where over the past decade we \r\nhave seen some of the fastest-growing economies. But \r\nit is crucial to put an end to the conflicts that still aff lict \r\nparts of the region and hold back its development. From \r\nthe Sahel to the Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes \r\nregion, Spain contributes to ending these conflicts \r\nby meeting its commitments, which are born out of \r\nsolidarity and proximity.\r\nWe believe in Africa and we are demonstrating that \r\nbelief, for instance when acute crises arise such as the \r\nEbola epidemic, which is affecting a major and growing \r\npart of the central region. I want to express the Spanish \r\npeople’s solidarity with the victims and our support for \r\nthose who are doing everything possible to assist them, \r\nsometimes at the cost of their own lives. And I offer my \r\nown heartfelt tribute to the humanitarian aid workers of \r\nthe United Nations, whose vocation leads them to leave \r\neverything behind for the most vulnerable, wherever \r\nthey may be.\r\nIt has been almost 30 years since my father, \r\nKing Juan Carlos, addressed this General Assembly for \r\nthe first time (see A/41/PV.4). Today, as then, Spain is \r\nopen to a new age. Today, as then, we take our place \r\nas active and responsible members of international \r\ncommunity represented here. I can assure those present \r\nhere that the international community, represented \r\ntoday in the General Assembly, can continue to count \r\non Spain’s support and active participation in the \r\nunwavering protection of the values  and interests of \r\nhumankind in peace, peace that is ever more prosperous \r\nand just. Spain supports a United Nations that is not \r\nonly stronger but, above all, more united — more \r\nunited against bigotry, intolerance and barbarism, more \r\nunited in fighting poverty, hunger and marginalization, \r\nmore united so that education and health can reach all, \r\nand more united in firmly defending the dignity of all \r\nhuman beings.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the King of Spain for the statement  he \r\nhas just made.\r\nHis Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of Spain, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel \r\nAziz, President of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nMauritania.\r\n20/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ould Abdel Aziz (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the African Union and of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Mauritania, I am pleased to express to you, Sir, my \r\nwarmest congratulations and my best wishes on the \r\noccasion of your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. I trust that your \r\ngood judgement and your competence, as well as your \r\nextensive experience in the diplomatic leadership of \r\nyour brotherly country, Uganda, constitute the best \r\nguarantee for the good conduct and success of the work \r\nof our current session.\r\nI am also pleased to point out the remarkable \r\nwork of your predecessor, Mr. John Ashe, during his \r\nleadership of the proceedings of the previous session. \r\nI would also like to express my warmest thanks to His \r\nExcellency the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his tireless efforts for international peace and \r\nsecurity and for his approach in support of dialogue as \r\nthe best way to address the current international issues.\r\nThe General Assembly has always been a forum \r\nfor the exchange of opinions and the discussion of \r\nimportant international issues that affect the lives of \r\nnations and people. That explains the privileged status \r\nthat it has gained within the different institutions of the \r\nUnited Nations system. This annual meeting, which \r\nbrings leaders together, is a valuable opportunity to \r\nseek a common understanding for a global vision, \r\nensuring proposals for efficient solutions to the current \r\ninternational problems that respond to the expectations \r\nof people around the world.\r\nIn that regard, I am pleased to address this audience \r\nand to present to the world, through this forum, what \r\nwe Africans have done in terms of achievements and \r\ndevelopment, the challenges facing our young continent, \r\nour expectations of the international community and \r\nour aspirations in terms of an effective contribution \r\nto addressing the current situation, humanity and the \r\nbuilding of its future.\r\nSeveral countries of the African continent have \r\nexperienced high levels of growth despite the severe \r\neconomic crisis that still prevails in the world. The \r\naverage growth rate in the continent has reached 5 per \r\ncent and is nearing 6 per cent. That economic recovery \r\nis the result, among other factors, of the wise economic \r\npolicies adopted by African Governments. The \r\npromotion of local and foreign investment, the building \r\nof new infrastructure and greater attention to the most \r\nvulnerable members of society have therefore been \r\nencouraged. Similarly, projects and income-generating \r\nactivities have been supported, thereby contributing \r\nefficiently to the reduction of unemployment, in \r\nparticular among young people and women. Africa is \r\nworking tirelessly to change from a consumption space \r\nto a production zone in order to ensure employment \r\nopportunities for millions of its people.\r\nThe achievement of food self-sufficiency, the \r\ndevelopment of agricultural industries and poverty \r\nreduction in rural areas are core objectives of the \r\nAfrican Union. In that regard, the agriculture and \r\nanimal resources sector has received great interest \r\nduring successive African summits. The year 2014 has \r\ntherefore been declared the Year of Agriculture and \r\nFood Security in Africa. The agriculture sector employs \r\nsome 60 per cent of the workforce and represents one \r\nthird of the gross domestic product of the continent.\r\nIn that context, the African summit recommended \r\nthat 10 per cent of the budget of African States be \r\nallocated to the development of the agriculture sector. \r\nAfrican Governments have recognized the importance \r\nof food security and adopted efficient policies for the \r\ndevelopment of that vital sector. Such policies have \r\nachieved their objectives and have enabled some \r\nAfrican countries to be self-sufficient in various \r\nagricultural products, while other countries are making \r\nsteady progress on that path. They, too, are therefore \r\nbecoming self-sufficient.\r\nIn Africa, we seek fruitful cooperation with our \r\npartners, thereby opening international markets to \r\nour agricultural products and, in that way, developing \r\nour capacities for agricultural research and providing \r\naccess to developed technologies and techniques for the \r\npreservation of the environment.\r\nWhen the Millennium Development Goals were \r\nadopted in 2000, Africa did not have a common \r\nvision for the major development issues. Its voice was \r\ntherefore not adequately heard. Despite that, we have \r\nworked seriously and energetically to achieve those \r\nGoals. Today, Africa speaks with one voice and seeks \r\nto promote development in order to become a healthy \r\n14-54711 21/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nregion free of scourges, wars and conflicts, where \r\njustice, good governance and respect for human rights \r\nprevail.\r\nIn that regard, African leaders have taken important \r\ndecisions on core issues for the continent, including \r\nthe vision of the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, which focuses on the \r\ndevelopment of human resources and the eradication \r\nof poverty, epidemics and deadly diseases. It must be \r\npointed out that the fight against AIDS, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis has been strengthened through the many \r\nprogrammes that have helped to promote actions to \r\nreduce the effects of such scourges.\r\nDespite such efforts, the indicators in the health \r\nsector lead us to exert every effort to strengthen our \r\nhealth-care system, to improve access to its services and \r\nto develop its human resources and infrastructure. In \r\nthat context, African Heads of State recently launched \r\na strong initiative to fight AIDS. The sudden outbreak \r\nof the Ebola virus in West Africa constitutes a major \r\nchallenge owing to the rapid spread of the disease and \r\nthe tragic fate of its victims. The steps taken to contain \r\nthe spread of that scourge remain inadequate and are \r\nnot sufficiently effective. Every day that passes until \r\nan appropriate treatment for the disease is discovered \r\nincreases the number of victims and causes it to \r\nspread to new areas. Despite the measures adopted and \r\nthe efforts made, to date, Africa has not managed to \r\nsuccessfully deal with the epidemic.\r\nI therefore appeal to the international community \r\nfrom this rostrum to work efficiently to provide \r\nnecessary vaccines for people affected by the Ebola \r\nvirus, to support measures to control its prevention \r\nand spread, and to increase investments in the field of \r\nscientific research in virology and endemic diseases, as \r\nwell as to provide assistance to countries affected by \r\nthat scourge. In this context, we welcome the actions \r\nand initiatives taken by some States and international \r\norganizations on behalf of the countries affected by the \r\nspread of this disease.\r\nThe phenomenon of illegal immigration and the \r\ntragedies it engenders daily prompt us to take strong \r\naction to find efficient and rapid solutions. We cannot \r\nsimply count the bodies that wash up onto the beaches \r\nor undertake rescue operations at sea for thousands of \r\nmigrants crammed in unsafe boats. Illegal immigration \r\nis a complex phenomenon. It is the cumulative result \r\nof economic factors and practices linked to organized \r\ncrime. Consequently, no matter how closely we patrol \r\nour borders and no matter how rigorous our laws, we \r\nwill not be able to prevent waves of migrants from \r\nmoving from south to north. Appropriate solutions \r\nmust be found that take into account the real causes \r\nof the phenomenon and that guarantee African youth \r\nincreased employment opportunities and a dignified \r\nlife.\r\nGood governance is a necessary precondition for \r\nsuccessful development efforts. The African political \r\nelite is fully aware of that fact and is committed \r\nto promoting collective freedom and consolidating \r\ndemocracy as the best means for managing public affairs. \r\nThe African Union has taken preventive measures \r\nagainst attempts at usurping power by non-democratic \r\nmeans, including by encouraging democratic practices, \r\nestablishing pluralism and organizing many transparent \r\nelections.\r\nIn its very essence, democracy implies the \r\nparticipation of all sectors of civil society. The nature \r\nof African societies has therefore required positive \r\ndiscrimination on behalf of women, allowing them \r\naccess to elective office and leadership positions in \r\norder to ensure gener equality. In the same context, \r\nyouth enjoys priority in development plans and in \r\nthe political, social and economic policies of African \r\ncountries. It is estimated that the population of the \r\ncontinent will reach 3 billion at the threshold of 2050; \r\ntwo thirds of that total will be youth. That demographic, \r\nspecific to the continent, calls for a new focus on \r\ninvestments in infrastructure and social services, and \r\nfor prioritizing such sectors as housing, employment, \r\nhuman resources, diversification of energy sources and \r\nhealth. Focus must also be placed on aligning teaching \r\nand vocational training with market needs, which will \r\ncontribute to controlling unemployment and allowing \r\nyouth to showcase their talents. In fact, unemployment \r\nin our societies stems less from inadequate employment \r\nopportunities than from the gap between the numbers \r\nof those trained and the actual needs of the job market.\r\nWith respect to security, we are currently facing \r\nmany dangers, including the multiplication of hot spots, \r\nterrorism, organized crime and trafficking in drugs, \r\narms and people — not only in Africa, but throughout \r\nthe world. All those dangers have a cross-border nature. \r\nSome African regions have been particularly vulnerable \r\ndue to the weakness of their democratic practice, the \r\nspread of ethnic conflicts, economic crises with their \r\nattendant social tensions, and the precarious situation \r\n22/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nof their educational systems, which exercerbates youth \r\nunemployment and deviation.\r\nIn order to address such challenges, the African \r\nUnion has established efficient mechanisms that rely on \r\nthe African peace and security architecture, including \r\nthe Peace and Security Council and the African \r\nCapacity for Immediate Response to Crises. Despite \r\nthose efforts and achievements, the fight against \r\nterrorism remains an international responsibility that \r\ncalls for close cooperation among all members of the \r\ninternational community. It is clear that no country \r\nalone can eradicate the phenomenon of terrorism.\r\nThe fruitful cooperation between the United \r\nNations Security Council and the African Council for \r\nPeace and Security has proved effective in resolving \r\nmany of the armed conflicts on our continent. Despite \r\nsuch efforts, however, the resolution of the situation \r\nin Somalia remains complex. Similarly, the situations \r\nin Libya, northern Nigeria and Central Africa are \r\ncause for genuine concern. In Libya, unfortunately, \r\nthe situation continues to deteriorate, foreshadowing \r\na civil war that could split the country apart, driving \r\nits people into exile and threatening to spill over into \r\nneighbouring countries. The international community \r\nmust intercede to help the Libyans reach a peaceful and \r\nconsensual solution that guarantees that country’s unity \r\nand stability. In northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram \r\nmovement continues to murder innocent people, kidnap \r\nwomen and destroy entire villages. Africa and the rest \r\nof the international community must join forces and \r\ntake decisive action to eliminate that terrorist group, \r\nwhich threatens the whole region.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, the efforts of \r\nthe African peacekeeping force, with the support of \r\nfriendly forces, helped stop the massacres and prevented \r\nthe conflict from evolving into a full-f ledged civil \r\nwar. However, persistent tension between the factions \r\nrequires us to encourage Central African stakeholders \r\nto use this stage of the transition build trust and to \r\novercome the remaining obstacles to that country’s \r\npeace and stability.\r\nSuch situations should not lead us to overlook \r\nthe peacebuilding progress that has been achieved in \r\nmany conflict regions. In that regard, we commend and \r\nwelcome the advances registered in the region of the \r\nGreat Lakes, in northern Mali and in the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan.\r\nThe Sahel was one of the first African regions to \r\nexperience the phenomenon of terrorism. But thanks to \r\nthe close security cooperation among the countries of the \r\nregion and to international solidarity, the terrorists were \r\nrepelled and the activities of illegal trafficking networks \r\nwere paralysed. In North Mali, too, Africans have \r\nrobustly addressed a difficult situation. Thus, several \r\ncountries of the continent, along with international \r\nfriendly forces, deterred terrorist groups. The risk of \r\nterrorism was eliminated from key areas from which \r\ncriminal terrorist operations had been launched. The \r\nFrench intervention was decisive and timely. Likewise, \r\nhistory will remember the great sacrifices that continue \r\nto be made by the brave soldiers of Chad.\r\nHowever, the region is still exposed to security \r\nrisks, which for the moment are relatively contained. \r\nThe eradication of terrorism in the Sahel region \r\nconstitutes a major challenge additional to those \r\nimpeding development and poverty reduction. There is \r\na close correlation between development and security, \r\nbecause it is impossible to conceive of sustainable \r\ndevelopment without security, or security without \r\nintegrated development.\r\nIn that regard, the countries of the region are \r\naware of the need, on the one hand, to create a regional \r\nframework to coordinate development efforts and, on \r\nthe other, to combat the dangers of terrorism and cross-\r\nborder crime. Therefore, the Group of Five countries \r\nof the Sahel was created at the summit meeting of \r\nmember States held in Nouakchott in February. The \r\ninternational community is invited to join Africans \r\nin their hopes and legitimate aspirations for peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development.\r\nThe conflict in the Middle East, which escalates \r\nfrom time to time, with no hope of achieving a clear \r\nand definite solution despite multiple Arab and \r\ninternational initiatives, constitutes an ongoing danger \r\nto world peace. The parties in conflict must agree to \r\nmake sacrifices, even painful ones. The international \r\ncommunity must also ramp up pressure and act swiftly \r\nto find a fair solution to the conflict on the basis of \r\nrelevant international resolutions, including those that \r\nguarantee the Palestinian people the establishment of \r\nan independent State, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its \r\ncapital.\r\nFurthermore, the dangerous situations in Syria \r\nand Iraq that have been created by the expansion \r\nof terrorism are causes of grave concern for the \r\ninternational community. We welcome the recent \r\nmeasures taken to combat terrorist groups in Iraq, and \r\nwe invite the parties to the Syrian conflict to renounce \r\n14-54711 23/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nviolence and engage in negotiations to avoid further \r\ndestruction to their country. The crisis in Ukraine must \r\nlikewise be resolved peacefully and quickly in order to \r\npreserve global peace and to prevent the situation from \r\ngenerating tensions between the major Powers.\r\nThe African continent seeks to strengthen its \r\npresence in international forums and institutions, \r\ncommensurate with its size and role, in order to make \r\nthem more representative of its peoples and nations. \r\nAlthough the General Assembly is an international \r\ninstitution in which all countries are represented \r\nequally, the status of permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil remains the monopoly of a restricted number \r\nof countries. That privilege, which dates back to the \r\nSecond World War of the last century, no longer reflects \r\ninternational geopolitical reality and does not take into \r\naccount the profound transformations that have taken \r\nplace throughout the world. Today, Africa occupies an \r\nimportant position in the world and plays a distinctive \r\nrole within the international community, making it a \r\ncandidate for permanent representation on the Security \r\nCouncil. It is therefore critical to engage as soon as \r\npossible in negotiations on the rules for expanding both \r\npermanent and non-permanent representation on the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe establishment of justice at the international \r\nlevel also entails reform of the world economic system \r\nto make it more equitable through greater promotion \r\nof the role of the United Nations in efforts to increase \r\ntransparency, improve regulation of the financial system \r\nand promote the investment necessary to sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFinally, I offer my sincere thanks for the efforts \r\nmade to ensure the success of this session. Attaining the \r\nlofty aims for which the United Nations was established \r\nremains dependent on the freedom of the world’s people \r\nto exercise their right to development, advancement \r\nand progress so that all humankind may live in dignity, \r\nfreedom, justice and equality.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nMauritania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Ms. Michelle Bachelet \r\nJeria, President of the Republic of Chile\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of \r\nthe Republic of Chile, and to invite her to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe end of the twentieth century, we imagined that the \r\ntwenty-first century would bring greater progress and \r\npeace for all and that it would be free of the tragedies \r\nthat had convulsed the world. Indeed, we have seen \r\nhopeful signs of development in many dimensions. Yet \r\nparadoxically, we see all around us the symptoms of \r\ncrises that, while they may be more localized, have \r\nmore devastating humanitarian consequences. These \r\nchallenges include regional wars, ethnic and religious \r\ntensions, humanitarian crises, the trampling of human \r\nrights, the break-up of several States, climate change, \r\ndeepening inequality, cross-border terrorism and the \r\nspread of terrible pandemics such as Ebola, all of \r\nwhich require a firm, urgent response on the part of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThat instability, along with a lack of social \r\ncohesion, poses a threat to peace, security, human \r\nrights, development and democracy. This affects not \r\nonly countries or States, but the actual men and women \r\nwho inhabit them. In other words, it is a threat to all we \r\nbelieve in — everything that constitutes the basis of the \r\nagreement on which the United Nations was founded \r\nand everything that is our raison d’être as leaders of \r\nour societies. That is why the United Nations remains \r\nirreplaceable as an institution for addressing global \r\nchallenges and for agreeing on the actions needed to \r\nresolve them, even if some of those actions have not \r\nproduced the desired results.\r\nThe Security Council has contributed to addressing \r\nand preventing crises. One response has been the \r\ndesign of robust peacekeeping operations with a strong \r\nemphasis on the protection of civilians. However, on \r\nmany occasions Council members have been unable \r\nto act with unity. That undoubtedly undermines the \r\n24/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nlegitimacy and credibility of the principal organ \r\nresponsible for international peace and security.\r\nThis year has seen a significant rise in the number \r\nof humanitarian crises around the world, in particular \r\nin the number of complex emergencies with regional \r\nimpacts that indirectly affect already-fragile States. We \r\nare concerned about the 3 million refugees created by \r\nthe crisis in Syria; about the actions of terrorist groups \r\nsuch as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant; about the \r\ncruel violence that the world has witnessed in Gaza. We \r\nexpress our solidarity with the victims and categorically \r\ncondemn the use of violence. Any action in this area \r\nmust be taken within the context of international law. \r\nWe believe that the international community should \r\nseek political solutions and inclusive negotiations \r\nto facilitate action by the Security Council. For our \r\npart, we are prepared to increase our humanitarian \r\ncommitments and shall consider accepting refugees \r\nfrom those conflict zones.\r\nWe are also concerned about the situation in \r\nUkraine. Here the position of Chile is clear. We \r\nbelieve that the principle of territorial integrity must \r\nbe respected and that, at the same time, the rights of \r\nminorities must be protected. We believe that a solution \r\ncan be found to prevent an escalation of violence, \r\nsanctions and tensions that may well spread throughout \r\nthe planet.\r\nGenerally speaking, we wish to reaffirm our belief \r\nin the need to respect the integrity of State borders. \r\nInternational law is clear and unambiguous. Any \r\naction designed to affect existing boundary treaties \r\ncreates room for legal uncertainty and could jeopardize \r\ninternational peace and stability. In that context, we \r\ncontinue to believe that reform of the Security Council \r\nis a pending issue requiring political decision and swift \r\naction. We reiterate our support for the enlargement of \r\nthe Council and for the aspirations of Germany, Brazil, \r\nJapan and India to become permanent members. In \r\naddition, Chile favours a serious debate on the French \r\nproposal to limit the right to veto in the case of crimes \r\ninvolving the responsibility to protect.\r\nWe acknowledge the Secretary-General’s efforts to \r\nachieve a more inclusive global governance in which \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda and the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals occupy a central place and require \r\nthe political support of Governments and societies in \r\nall regions. The post-2015 process provides a great \r\nopportunity to tackle the social and development \r\nissues common to all societies and regions, using \r\na comprehensive approach, through specific and \r\nmeasurable goals. Women and peace and security is an \r\nitem on the agenda of the Security Council to which \r\nChile, as a member of the Council, attaches priority. \r\nSince the adoption of resolution 1325 (2000), the world \r\nhas made progress in the protection of women and girls \r\nin armed conflicts.\r\nOur efforts to empower women and promote \r\ninitiatives to combat violence against women and girls \r\nhave been tireless. Thanks to those efforts, today women \r\nare at the centre of the new development and peace \r\narchitecture. We believe that the full incorporation \r\nof women in every area of society — including the \r\neconomy, politics, and culture — is a prerequisite for \r\ntheir full development. It, therefore, should also be a \r\npriority in the post-2015 development agenda, as should \r\nearly childhood development, which is something that \r\nhas to do with the future of our societies.\r\nI come from Latin America, a region of \r\nmiddle-income countries that has its own dreams, \r\nchallenges and tasks. For us, sustainable development, \r\nsecurity, the quality of governance and, above all, \r\ninequality and social cohesion are the most pressing \r\nproblems. We want those challenges to appear in the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, which must be inclusive \r\nand reflect the situation in all regions of the world.\r\nWe believe that inequality is one of the greatest \r\nthreats to countries’ development and international \r\nsecurity. It fosters social unrest and prevents us all \r\nfrom moving towards inclusive development and \r\nending exclusion and poverty, which in turn can lead \r\nto resentment and violence. Therefore, overcoming \r\ninequality, with its many faces, must occupy a central \r\nplace among the post-2015 development goals. We also \r\nbelieve that the United Nations system should have the \r\ntools for measuring specific progress in a universal \r\nagenda to combat inequality.\r\nChile is dealing with the challenge of inequality \r\ndecisively and over the long term. Today in Chile, there \r\nis a common belief in the need for change — change \r\nspecifically designed to substantially improve equity \r\nand inclusion. Having made great progress, Chile would \r\nlike to consolidate and move ahead but recognizes that a \r\nsociety that has undergone profound and rapid changes \r\nfaces new challenges.\r\nPublic opinion and political evolution tell us that \r\nthe time has come to take meaningful steps through \r\n14-54711 25/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nsubstantive reforms providing the essential basis \r\nfor moving towards a more dynamic, inclusive and \r\nequitable development. That is a basic condition for \r\nmoving towards a better society for all. To that end, we \r\nhave recently adopted a tax reform to ensure greater \r\nequity, fiscal sustainability and the resources necessary \r\nto carry out an education reform that will ensure a \r\nquality education, free of charge, and opportunities for \r\nall. Chile will not achieve development while dragging \r\nthe burden of inequality. We all know that, which is \r\nwhy the tax reform has received cross-cutting support.\r\nWe are also introducing long-awaited political \r\nreforms to enhance our democracy and institutional \r\nlegitimacy. We have already adopted a law allowing \r\nChileans residing abroad to vote. Progress is being made \r\non the reform to alter the electoral system by eliminating \r\nthe existing bias and motivating citizens to participate, \r\nsince now every vote will count. And we want to move \r\ntowards a new Constitution with fully democratic \r\nfoundations and content. We launched a productivity \r\nand growth agenda to stimulate the economy, promote \r\nsustainable development and create decent jobs, as a \r\nbasic prerequisite for achieving a lasting reduction in \r\ninequality and enhancing opportunities. Ultimately, we \r\nwant to broaden the scope of rights to bring them into \r\nline with our enhanced capability as a country.\r\nClimate change exacerbates inequalities and \r\nintensifies threats. There is a collective duty to act, \r\nand Chile is convinced that Latin America has a big \r\ncontribution to make in this debate. Climate change \r\naggravates inequalities because it has the greatest \r\nimpact on the most vulnerable. Chile has only a marginal \r\neffect on the problem, since it accounts for only 0.25 per \r\ncent of carbon emissions, but it undoubtedly suffers the \r\nconsequences of climate change, as do many others. \r\nTherefore, we want to be part of the solution. Since \r\nwe understand that this entails a global commitment, \r\ndifferentiated actions and binding obligations, we \r\nvoluntarily made a commitment to reduce our emissions \r\nby 20 per cent by 2020. Several other Latin American \r\ncountries have made similar voluntary commitments. \r\nWe should like to propose here that there be some type \r\nof accountability, which would facilitate compliance \r\nand would help to set an example for the countries that \r\nare lagging behind.\r\nThe Organization must ensure the efficiency and \r\nconsistency of multilateralism as a special forum \r\nfor tackling the major global issues in an inclusive \r\nmanner, creating international regimes and promoting \r\ncooperation arrangements in priority areas for our \r\npeoples. Our country trusts multilateralism, and \r\nwe believe that participating in the system involves \r\nboth rights and responsibilities. Because we want to \r\ncontribute to the solution of global problems, we are a \r\nmember of the Security Council and the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, we aspire to membership in the Economic \r\nand Social Council, and we are contributing to \r\npeacekeeping operations, including the United Nations \r\nStabilization Mission in Haiti. That Mission, in which \r\na number of Latin American countries are engaged, is \r\na tangible action of solidarity to support the democratic \r\nconsolidation of a sister country.\r\nWe believe, therefore, that it is a political imperative \r\nto strengthen multilateralism in three fundamental \r\nways. The first is by enhancing the Secretary-General’s \r\nability to take initiatives. In the context of the functions \r\nenvisaged in the Charter, it is essential to continue \r\nsupport for the political leadership of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to take preventive action and respond to urgent \r\nsituations that jeopardize the dignity of people and \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe second relates to fieldwork. The ability of the \r\nsystem to take action in the field is a basic prerequisite \r\nin order for the Organization to be relevant to people’s \r\ndemands and real problems. As the former Executive \r\nDirector of UN-Women, I had the privilege of seeing the \r\nconviction, solidarity and dedication with which United \r\nNations staff help to promote the ideals, principles and \r\nmandates of the system.\r\nThe third area of focus is development and \r\ncooperation. The process of constructing a post-\r\n2015 development agenda requires renewed efforts to \r\nprovide official development assistance and to promote \r\ninnovative financing mechanisms, encouraging \r\npartnerships between countries, international bodies, \r\ncivil society and the private sector.\r\nChile is interested in a greater coordination of \r\ninitiatives and instruments to facilitate South-South \r\ncooperation between middle-income countries while \r\nseeking out ways in which their essential contribution \r\ncan be made effective. I would also like to note that \r\nin Chile we have enacted legal provisions to open our \r\neconomy fully to imports from the 48 least developed \r\ncountries, without duties or quotas.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the irrevocable \r\ncommitments made by Chile’s successive democratic \r\nGovernments to the work of the United Nations. Those \r\n26/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ncommitments reflect universal principles and values, as \r\nthey promote the protection, dignity and fundamental \r\nrights of all individuals and contribute to crisis \r\nprevention, dialogue, reconciliation and post-conflict \r\nmanagement. Our convictions and efforts will always \r\nbe aimed at enhancing the legitimacy of collective \r\naction to meet people’s concerns and demands. We \r\nbelieve that, with an effective and real effort on the \r\npart of the international community, we will be able \r\nto deal successfully with exceptional crises and, first \r\nand foremost, build a world in which all inhabitants live \r\ntogether in peace and dignity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Chile \r\nfor the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Park Geun-Hye, President of the \r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMs. Park Geun-Hye, President of the Republic of \r\nKorea, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Park Geun-Hye, President of the \r\nRepublic of Korea, and to invite her to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Park Geun-Hye (spoke in Korean; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Let me start \r\nby congratulating you, Mr. Kutesa, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. I am confident that the Assembly will \r\nmake meaningful progress during this session under \r\nyour able leadership. I would also like to express my \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ntireless efforts to tackle the numerous crises breaking \r\nout around the globe.\r\nNext year marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the United Nations. I am prompted by the \r\nstate of our world today to reflect once again upon the \r\nnoble dreams and ideals that inspired the founders of \r\nthe United Nations 70 years ago. The founders aspired \r\nto build a new world that places people at the centre, as \r\nthe opening words of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\n“We the peoples”, remind us. Throughout the ensuing \r\ndecades of the Cold War and the post-Cold-War era, the \r\nUnited Nations tackled countless crises, striving, as it \r\ndid so, to fulfil its purpose of maintaining international \r\npeace, promoting development and upholding human \r\nrights.\r\nYet our world continues to be beset by widespread \r\ndisputes and conflicts, both large and small, despite \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations. The civil conflicts \r\nraging on in Syria, Libya and South Sudan are causing \r\nthe deaths of untold numbers of innocent women and \r\nchildren. In Iraq and surrounding areas, the activities \r\nof foreign terrorist fighters are posing new threats to \r\npeace internationally, not to mention in the Middle \r\nEast. The fragile ceasefires in Gaza and Ukraine call \r\nfor more fundamental and lasting solutions. The recent \r\nEbola outbreak in Africa, widespread poverty and \r\nnatural disasters underscore the scope of the threat \r\nfrom multiple challenges.\r\nIn order to push back against those challenges \r\nto peace and development, we need to return to the \r\nfounding spirit of the United Nations by putting people \r\nfirst and promotinge cooperation among the Members \r\nof the family of nations. To meet the aspirations of \r\nthe international community for justice and common \r\nprosperity, the United Nations needs to continue to \r\nplay a central role in arranging more rapid and efficient \r\nresponses.\r\nThe Republic of Korea was founded in 1948 with the \r\nblessing of the United Nations. It was able to safeguard \r\nfreedom and democracy during the Korean war that \r\nbroke out two years later, again with the help of the \r\nUnited Nations. Once a country that barely managed to \r\nsurvive with United Nations assistance, the Republic \r\nof Korea is today a nation that has achieved both an \r\nadvanced market economy and democracy. In the course \r\nof that journey, the Republic of Korea came to espouse \r\nthe values upheld by the United Nations — peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights — as its own vision.\r\nGiven its history, the Republic of Korea is no \r\nstranger to the agonies of the civil wars, aggression, \r\npoverty and humanitarian disasters that are unfolding \r\naround the world. That is why the Republic of Korea \r\nis actively working to serve international peace and \r\npromote human rights and sustainable development \r\nas a member of the three major Councils of the United \r\nNations: the Security Council, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council.\r\n14-54711 27/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nThe developments unfolding in the Middle East, \r\nEurasia, and North-East Asia are a far cry from the \r\npeaceful and just world that was envisioned by the \r\nUnited Nations founders. Overcoming the instability \r\nand chaos we see today must start with our adherence \r\nto the fundamental order and norms of the international \r\ncommunity, namely, respect for sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity; refraining from the threat or use of \r\nforce in violation of the Charter; and respect for human \r\nrights and humanitarian values.\r\nWe need to prevent the development and \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as \r\nnuclear weapons, which pose a fundamental threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. In that regard, we \r\nwelcome the elimination of Syria’s chemical weapons \r\nthrough the joint efforts of the United Nations and the \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons \r\nand the progress being made in addressing the Iranian \r\nnuclear issue.\r\nBy the same token, I would underline the urgency \r\nof resolving the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nnuclear issue, which presents the single greatest threat \r\nto peace on the Korean peninsula and in North-East \r\nAsia. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is \r\nthe only country to have conducted a nuclear test in \r\nthe twenty-first century. Its nuclear programme not \r\nonly is a serious threat to international peace, but \r\nalso amounts to a total rejection of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which is the \r\nbackbone of the global nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nmust make the decision to give up its nuclear weapons. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea should \r\nfollow in the footsteps of other countries that have \r\nabandoned their nuclear weapons in favour of reform \r\nand opening-up, and it must choose a different path that \r\nsupports its economic development and improves the \r\nlives of its people. Should it do this, the Republic of \r\nKorea, together with the international community, will \r\nprovide our strong support for developing the economy \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nIn addition to that serious challenge on the Korean \r\nPeninsula, North-East Asia is undergoing a difficult \r\ntransition. There are growing tensions in the region \r\nsurrounding issues of history, territory and maritime \r\nsecurity. Yet, unlike other regions, North-East Asia \r\nlacks a mechanism for dealing with those problems \r\nthrough multilateral consultations. It is against that \r\nbackdrop that I am seeking to advance a North-East \r\nAsia peace and cooperation initiative that is aimed \r\nat building an order of trust and cooperation in the \r\nregion. In my view, building up habits of cooperation in \r\npractical areas, such as climate action, disaster relief, \r\nnuclear safety and tackling transnational crime, can \r\nmaterialize into a multilateral process of cooperation \r\nalong the lines of what we see in Europe.\r\nIn that context, I have also proposed creating a \r\nNorth-East Asia nuclear safety consultative body to \r\ndiscuss nuclear safety issues, a topic of shared interest \r\nfor the countries in the region. At the same time, we \r\nare reaching beyond North-East Asia and seeking to \r\nbuild transportation and energy networks across an \r\neconomically interdependent Eurasia, which would \r\nhelp strengthen political trust and security across the \r\ncontinent.\r\nThis year marks 20 years since the Rwandan \r\ngenocide, the world’s greatest humanitarian tragedy of \r\nthe late twentieth century. The international community \r\nhad pledged “never again” in the aftermath of the \r\ngenocides in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the \r\n1990s. Yet, we are witnessing today a different type of \r\nhumanitarian disaster unfolding in Syria and Iraq. The \r\nRepublic of Korea is actively participating in the efforts \r\nof the United Nations to prevent such humanitarian \r\ntragedies. The Republic of Korea strongly supports \r\nUnited Nations policies to protect human rights, such \r\nas the Rights Up Front initiative and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s “open gate” policy. Even as we speak, Korean \r\ntroops are taking part in United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions in South Sudan and Lebanon, helping with \r\npeacebuilding, reconstruction and the protection of \r\ncivilians and human rights.\r\nThe Republic of Korea also attaches great \r\nimportance to preventing human suffering, particularly \r\nof women and children, who are most vulnerable, \r\nin conflict situations. In that context, during its \r\npresidency of the Security Council in February 2013, \r\nKorea presided over an open debate (see S/PV.6917) on \r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict and helped \r\nraise global awareness. Korea is also participating in and \r\nchampioning the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. \r\nSexual violence against women during armed conflicts \r\nis a clear violation of human rights and humanitarian \r\nnorms, regardless of how long ago or where it occurred.\r\nThe human rights situation in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is also the subject of \r\nprofound interest and concern for the international \r\n28/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ncommunity. In March, the Human Rights Council \r\nadopted recommendations proposed by the Commission \r\nof Inquiry on Human Rights in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. The Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and the international community should \r\ntake the necessary measures to implement those \r\nrecommendations. In that regard, the United Nations \r\noffice that will soon be set up in the Republic of Korea \r\nto investigate human rights abuses in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is expected to reinforce such \r\nefforts. The international community should also pay \r\ngreater attention to the human rights situation of North \r\nKorean defectors. The relevant United Nations agencies \r\nand countries should provide the necessary support \r\nso that defectors can freely choose their resettlement \r\ndestination.\r\nThe challenges facing humankind today, such as \r\nabsolute poverty and climate change, can be addressed \r\nonly through a concerted international response, given \r\ntheir complexity and intertwined character. Less than \r\n500 days remain until the target date of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which was launched with the \r\naim of eradicating absolute poverty and increasing \r\nsocial and economic opportunities. The Republic of \r\nKorea is ready, by harnessing our unique historical \r\nexperience, to play a bridging role between developed \r\nand developing countries as the post-2015 development \r\ngoals are set. In that regard, the decision was made as \r\na result of the Busan Partnership agreement, adopted \r\nat the Ministerial Meeting in April in Mexico, to turn \r\nthe Global Partnership for Effective Development \r\nCooperation into an international development \r\ncooperative mechanism.\r\nThe Republic of Korea will seek to enhance the \r\nquality of its overseas assistance. We will continue \r\nto share our development experience, by globally \r\npromoting the Saemaul movement model, which was \r\nconducive to eradicating rural poverty in Korea through \r\nthe spirit of diligence, self-reliance and cooperation. \r\nHaving seen the power of education in propelling its \r\nown development, the Republic of Korea strongly \r\nsupports and is championing the Secretary-General’s \r\nGlobal Education First Initiative. Korea will share its \r\nlessons learned and provide substantive support to the \r\nUnited Nations initiatives on education, which is one of \r\nthe main themes of the post-2015 development goals. To \r\nthat end, Korea will host the World Education Forum \r\nin 2015 and make efforts to reach an agreement on the \r\nnew education objectives for the next 15 years.\r\nClimate change is no less an existential threat \r\nto humanity than the question of war and peace. At \r\nthe Climate Summit 2014 held at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters yesterday, 23 September, leaders \r\nproclaimed their collective resolve to reach a consensus \r\non the post-2020 new climate regime. Going forward, \r\nan agreement must be reached on a new climate regime \r\nby the 2015 Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nParis. As the host country of the Green Climate Fund \r\n(GCF) and the Green Growth Global Institute (GGGI), \r\nKorea is committed to supporting international efforts \r\nto strengthen developing countries’ mitigation and \r\nadaptation capacities. Above all, we will continue to \r\nwork for the full and early operationalization of the GCF \r\nand for the expansion of GGGI assistance to developing \r\ncountries. Korea views the climate challenge not as a \r\nburden but as an opportunity to unleash new value, \r\nmarkets and jobs through technological innovation. \r\nWe are nurturing new energy industries. And we hope \r\nto share the fruits of our efforts with other developing \r\ncountries.\r\nThe Korean people gained independence 69 years \r\nago, but the subsequent division of the Korean peninsula \r\nprecluded its membership in the United Nations as a \r\nsingle sovereign State. The two Koreas were admitted \r\nseparately as Member States to the United Nations \r\nin 1991. Having two separate seats despite a single \r\nlanguage, culture and history is clearly not normal. \r\nThis year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the fall \r\nof the Berlin Wall, but the Korean peninsula remains \r\nstif led by a wall of division. Countless separated \r\nfamilies have been spending decades in agony, longing \r\nto see their loved ones. Every year, many leave for a \r\nplace where they will never be able to meet their loved \r\nones in person. I call on the international community to \r\nstand with us in tearing down the world’s last remaining \r\nwall of division.\r\nNot long ago, I proposed to the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea that we build corridors that \r\ncan connect our environment, our livelihoods and our \r\nculture. In my view, a genuine community that can heal \r\nthe wounds of division and move both sides forward \r\ntogether will come about only when people from the \r\nSouth and the North are able to live in natural harmony \r\nwithin a single ecosystem, when separated families are \r\nable to come together and ease their agony, and when \r\nculture is shared.\r\nToday, the Korean peninsula is divided by a \r\n4-kilometre wide, 250-kilometre long demilitarized \r\n14-54711 29/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nzone (DMZ). The DMZ, built around the military \r\ndemarcation line to prevent renewed conflict, has \r\nin reality ended up preventing the back-and-forth \r\nmovement of people for some 60 years. But from the \r\nstretches of the DMZ would emerge, in those decades, a \r\ntreasure trove of nature’s wildlife. The DMZ ecosystem \r\nis a testament to the fact that the South and North are \r\npart of a single whole, one which both sides should \r\nwork together to restore. And so I hope to build inside \r\nthe very symbol of our division a world ecopeace park \r\nthat would begin to reconnect the Peninsula’s divided \r\nnature and divided people. If we can sweep away the \r\nbarbed-wire fences from small areas inside the DMZ \r\nand thereby allow people from both sides to live in \r\nnatural harmony, such a park could emerge as a corridor \r\nof life and peace.\r\nI call on the United Nations to spearhead these \r\nefforts. Building a park that embodies respect for \r\ninternational standards and values, and doing so under \r\nUnited Nations auspices, with all the parties to the \r\nwar on board — the two Koreas, the United States and \r\nChina — would serve to ease tensions and promote the \r\npeaceful reunification of the two Koreas. A unified \r\nKorea would be a starting point for a world without \r\nnuclear weapons, offer a fundamental solution to the \r\nNorth Korean human rights issue and help unlock a \r\nstable and cooperative North-East Asia. Just as the \r\nunification of Germany laid the ground for a new Europe \r\nby integrating that continent, a unified Korea could set \r\nin motion a new North-East Asia. I am confident that a \r\npeacefully reunified Korean peninsula will contribute \r\nto realizing the founding purposes and values espoused \r\nby the United Nations.\r\nMrs. Baaro (Kiribati), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe founders of the United Nations were not \r\ndeterred by the heat of war from looking to the future and \r\nplanning for a peaceful post-war world. The Republic \r\nof Korea is committed to a vision of diplomacy that \r\nseeks lasting peace and unification on the peninsula \r\nand peace and development in North-East Asia and \r\ncontributes to building a happier world. The Republic \r\nof Korea will do its part in that noble undertaking to \r\nensure that the United Nations continues to safeguard \r\nour common values and cements its place at the centre \r\nof global governance.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Korea for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Park Geun-hye, President of the Republic of \r\nKorea, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Amir of the Republic of Qatar.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad \r\nAl-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We wish him \r\nsuccess in his mission. I would also like to thank His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Ashe for his work during his \r\npresidency. And I thank His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his efforts to promote and \r\noperationalize the role of the United Nations.\r\nThe start of this year’s session comes at a time \r\nwhen recent international developments are affecting \r\nthe security and safety of all humankind. In that \r\nregard, it is essential that the United Nations live up \r\nto its role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security through all the mechanisms and means \r\nprovided for in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nexplore every possible way of preventing conflicts and \r\naddressing their root causes, and work to settle them \r\nby peaceful means. We cannot achieve international \r\npeace and security without a dialogue based on the \r\nprinciple of equality and compliance with international \r\nlaw, implementation of the resolutions of international \r\nlegality and respect for the principles of human rights \r\nand the rights of peoples.\r\nThe Middle East went through an extremely \r\ndangerous phase during the recent war on our \r\nPalestinian brothers. There are no guarantees that it \r\nwill not recur. Israel continues to persist in its policies \r\nof occupation and to defy the will of the international \r\ncommunity by confiscating land in the West Bank and \r\nbuilding settlements in an effort to perpetuate that \r\noccupation. Humankind was shocked by the tragic \r\n30/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nscenes and unprecedented images of destruction during \r\nthe latest round of aggression targeting civilians in \r\nGaza. Babies were killed in their mothers’ arms, almost \r\nhalf a million Palestinians were displaced and the Gaza \r\nStrip was virtually destroyed when people had hardly \r\nmanaged to rebuild after the destruction inflicted on \r\nGaza during the previous war. Under international \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law, such acts are \r\ndefined as crimes against humanity. The arrogance \r\nof power will not prevail over the resistance of the \r\nPalestinian people. I salute their steadfast resistance in \r\nthe face of the occupation in Gaza and their insistence \r\non regaining their legitimate rights. May the souls of \r\nthe Palestinian martyrs rest in peace.\r\nIsrael must realize that it can achieve security for \r\nits people only through peace, and that the occupation \r\nis bound to end. The damage caused by Israel’s repeated \r\nacts of aggression in the Gaza Strip in recent years, \r\nthe unjust blockade imposed on it and the destruction \r\nwreaked on its infrastructure make it incumbent \r\non the international community to compel Israel to \r\nimplement internationally agreed-on resolutions, fulfil \r\nits obligations and hasten to remove every obstacle \r\nto lifting the blockade and launching the process of \r\nreconstructionn. The State of Qatar will spare no effort \r\nto provide assistance for the reconstruction of the Gaza \r\nStrip, and we urge every country to follow suit.\r\nThe international community’s response to the \r\naspirations of the Palestinian people to freedom \r\nand national independence is vital to affirming the \r\njustice of international legality, especially since the \r\nquestion of Palestine is the last remaining issue on \r\nthe decolonization agenda. In that context, temporary \r\nsolutions and piecemeal settlements have proved useless \r\nand unacceptable. Israel’s intransigence compels us to \r\nresort to the United Nations as a framework that can \r\naccommodate all parties. \r\nThe Security Council should shoulder its moral \r\nand legal responsibilities by upholding the principles \r\nof international legality and human rights and avoiding \r\nthe selectivity that has characterized its approach to \r\nthis issue in recent times. It should adopt a resolution, \r\nunder Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nforcing Israel to end its occupation of the lands it seized \r\nin 1967 and to implement the two-State solution agreed \r\non by the international community, according to a clear \r\nand time-bound political plan, within the framework of \r\npeace negotiations leading to a permanent settlement of \r\nthe Palestinian question through a two-State solution, \r\nin accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative and the \r\nrelevant internationally legitimate resolutions. The \r\nworld is duty-bound to persuade the Palestinians that \r\nthose who killed their children in Gaza will not be \r\nreceived in diplomatic forums as if they had carried \r\nout a civilized action because they had bombed \r\nPalestinians from the air without staining their hands \r\nwith Palestinian blood.\r\nThe tragedy of the Syrian people, now in its fourth \r\nyear, represents one of the major challenges in the Middle \r\nEast. This humanitarian disaster has been exacerbated \r\nand is becoming increasingly dangerous by the lack of \r\na clear vision for a solution to the crisis, continued acts \r\nof murder and destruction, violations of human rights, \r\nthe terrible human suffering and the displacement \r\nof nearly half of the Syrian people. This makes it \r\nincumbent on the international community to strive \r\nto end the bloodshed and the systematic destruction of \r\nSyria by a regime that forces its people to choose \r\nbetween accepting its presence or burning down their \r\ncountry.\r\nWe have already warned that the continuation of the \r\nregime’s policy of terrorism, genocide and displacement, \r\nas well as the failure to provide support to the Syrian \r\nrevolution when it was still a civilian revolution \r\ndemanding freedom and dignity, would push many \r\nSyrians to opt for self-defence. We have also warned \r\nthe international community from the outset that if no \r\naction were taken about the situation in Syria, we would \r\nreach the point at which we now find ourselves. When \r\nthe Syrian people defended themselves with weapons, \r\nwe advocated providing them with support before the \r\nregime destroyed their country and before extremist \r\norganizations arose and f lourished. No red lines were \r\ndrawn to stop the actions of the Syrian regime. The \r\nworld remained silent even when Syrian children and \r\nwomen were killed with chemical weapons and when \r\nits populated neighbourhoods were levelled with barrel \r\nbombs. Eventually, the Syrian people found themselves \r\nstuck between the grip of terrorism of the regime and \r\nthat of extremist forces that thrived in the swamp of \r\nviolence. The war of genocide waged and the deliberate \r\ndisplacement carried out by the regime remain major \r\ncrimes.\r\nConfronted by this grim reality, the international \r\ncommunity needs to provide all aspects of humanitarian \r\naid to the Syrian people inside and outside their areas \r\nof refuge. We reiterate our call on the Security Council \r\nto promptly shoulder its legal and humanitarian \r\n14-54711 31/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nresponsibilities. It must support the Syrian people \r\nagainst the two dangers posed by the terrorism and \r\ncrimes of genocide of the regime, and by the terrorist \r\nforces that have taken advantage of the prevailing \r\nmisery, bitterness and the absence of the State and the \r\ninternational community. The first danger has begotten \r\nthe second.\r\nMany areas of the world suffer from the terrorism \r\nbeing perpetrated under different pretexts and slogans \r\nthat threaten the security and stability of the world and \r\nhamper the achievement of the desired development. No \r\ncivilization has been spared terrorism in the modern era. \r\nThere is no doubt that the most affected communities \r\nare those in which this evil seed had grown. This \r\nphenomenon is hostile to the diversity and pluralism \r\nthat enrich communities. In the case of the affected \r\nArab and Islamic societies, terrorism affects innocent \r\npeople, impoverishes our societies by depriving them \r\nof humanitarian and religious diversity, muzzles the \r\nreal demands of the peoples, and offends religion with \r\nits superficial and apostatic interpretations.\r\nTherefore we must all redouble our efforts to fight \r\nthis phenomenon whatever its forms, target or source \r\nmight be. It has been proved beyond any doubt that \r\nterrorism can be defeated only in its social environment. \r\nIf societies are to stand with us in the fight against \r\nterrorism, we need to be fair and not push them to \r\nchoose between terrorism and tyranny, or between \r\nterrorism and sectarian discrimination. We cannot win \r\nthe war on terror if peoples are not satisfied that it is \r\ntheir war and not a war to stabilize a regime that is \r\noppressing them.\r\nThe Syrian people have suffered from tyranny and \r\nterrorism. The international community did not heed \r\nthe cries for help of the Iraqi people, who have been the \r\nfirst victims of terrorism in Iraq. But those who fought \r\nterrorism and defeated it found themselves prone \r\nto marginalization and abuse by terrorist sectarian \r\nmilitias. It is therefore imperative to persuade the Iraqi \r\npeople that they will not pay the a thousandfold price, \r\nand that when they defend their homeland they are \r\nmerely defending their rights, dignity and freedoms, \r\nwhich must be guaranteed. This is what the majority \r\nof the Syrian people must be persuaded of after being \r\nsoaked in the blood spilled by the Syrian regime for \r\ndaring to demand freedom and dignity.\r\nIn this context, the international community \r\nneeds to stand firmly by brotherly Iraq in confronting \r\nterrorism and ending its ordeal. Preserving its \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the diversity of \r\nits sects can be achieved only by defusing sectarian \r\nconflict and achieving Iraqi reconciliation that lays the \r\nfoundations for a society free from sectarian and ethnic \r\nconflicts, with the participation of all political forces, \r\nwithout exclusion.\r\nIn this context, the international community must \r\nalso assist fraternal Libya in ending its current ordeal \r\nby making a serious effort to respect the will of the \r\nLibyan people and meet their legitimate aspirations \r\nfor security and stability through reconciliation and \r\nthe inclusion of all Libyan factions. From this rostrum, \r\nI call on all Libyan political forces to follow the path \r\nof national dialogue and to hammer out a formula for \r\ngovernance that meets the aspirations of the Libyan \r\npeople, who have sacrificed so much for their freedom.\r\nOn this occasion, I cannot but hail the nascent \r\nTunisian experience, which augurs well for our future \r\nand owes its progress to the awareness and unity of the \r\nTunisians and their insistence on the success of their \r\nexperiment, despite continuous attempts by Powers that \r\ndo not want pluralism to succeed in our region. Another \r\nsuccessful instance of the peaceful transfer of power \r\nhas been seen in Yemen. We were encouraged by the \r\noutcome of the national dialogue under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations and with the support of the Security \r\nCouncil, which adopted a resolution emphasizing \r\ncommitment to the process and condemning those \r\nundermining its implementation.\r\nBut it would seem that there are forces who are \r\njoining ranks in an attempt to thwart that experiment. \r\nSome oppose any change at all and would prefer to turn \r\nback the hands of the clock; others prefer sectarian \r\nconflict and sectarian and factional interests over \r\njustice and good governance for Yemen. Experience \r\nhas shown that the use of violence and political action \r\nfrom a factional or sectarian perspective does not lead \r\nto a change towards a better system of governance, but \r\nposes a threat to the political entity itself.\r\nWe call on our Yemeni brothers to preserve the \r\nachievements of the young people of Yemen, and \r\nthose of national dialogue and wisdom, and not to \r\nabandon what they have accomplished. They must not \r\nallow anyone to drag them onto the path of sectarian \r\nviolence. We also call on the United Nations to work \r\non implementing its decisions on the achievements of \r\nthe national dialogue, including rebuilding the army so \r\nthat it can defend the legitimate institutions and stop \r\nthe phenomenon of armed militias in Yemen. It has \r\n32/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nbecome clear that such forces would lead to civil strife \r\nand derail the process of peaceful transition.\r\nMany countries of the world still suffer from \r\npoverty and face difficulties in promoting their \r\ndevelopment at the desired pace. This holds true for the \r\nnew post-2015 sustainable development goals, which \r\nconstitute a common vision for future generations. I \r\nstress that the State of Qatar will pursue its efforts to \r\nbuild a partnership with the United Nations in order \r\nto adopt a post-2015 development plan that meets the \r\naspirations of the peoples of all countries and regional \r\nblocs.\r\nI would also like to note that the State of Qatar \r\nhas made progress in its national development plans \r\nand strengthened its regional and global partnerships, \r\nas confirmed by the United Nations 2014 Human \r\nDevelopment Index. The State of Qatar has been \r\nranked thirty-first globally, and today we continue the \r\nimplementation of the comprehensive national strategy \r\nfor human development based on the Qatar Vision 2030, \r\naimed at achieving development in various fields.\r\nThe State of Qatar will pursue its active policy \r\nof providing a space for dialogue in areas of conflict \r\nand for mediation between the various parties, as we \r\nbelieve in solving conflicts by peaceful means and \r\nhave established a tradition of peaceful mediation. We \r\nwill continue to provide a platform for dialogue among \r\npolitical currents, cultures and religions.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of the State of Qatar to work with the \r\nUnited Nations to address common challenges and \r\nachieve the goals we all seek.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank His Highness the Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar for the statement he has just made.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Armenia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nArmenia.\r\nMr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the Republic of \r\nArmenia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Serzh Sargsyan, President \r\nof the Republic of Armenia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Sargsyan (spoke in Armenian; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): We are \r\nmeeting at a symbolically significant time, between \r\nthe 100th anniversary of the First World War and the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the end of the Second World \r\nWar. Seven decades ago, at the end of the Second World \r\nWar, the United Nations was established. Its mission \r\nwas to form a new environment for civilization and \r\nculture in order to prevent the repetition of the previous \r\ntragic events of history.\r\nThe year 2015 is of particular significance \r\nfor all Armenians around the world. On 24 April, \r\nArmenians around the globe will commemorate \r\nthe 100th anniversary of the most tragic page in the \r\nnation’s history: the Armenian genocide. It was an \r\nunprecedented crime, the objective of which was to \r\neliminate the nation and deprive it of its homeland, \r\nand it remains an unhealed wound for every Armenian. \r\nThe 1915 genocide was a crime against civilization and \r\nhumanity, and its inadequate condemnation paved the \r\nway for similar crimes of mass murder in the future.\r\nAddressing the Assembly ahead of that 100th \r\nanniversary of the Armenian genocide from this \r\nrostrum, which I would call the podium of honour \r\nand responsibility, I declare our profound thanks \r\nto Uruguay, France, Russia, Italy, Belgium, the \r\nNetherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Germany, Poland, \r\nLithuania, Greece, Slovakia, Cyprus, Lebanon, \r\nArgentina, Venezuela, Chile, Canada and the Holy See. \r\nWe thank them for their recognition and condemnation \r\nof the Armenian genocide, regardless of the form it \r\ntook or the language used to express it. I thank the \r\nUnited States of America, the European Union and all \r\nthose personalities, State bodies, territorial units and \r\norganizations in many countries that publicly called \r\nthings by their proper name. That is indeed extremely \r\nimportant, since denial is an integral part of the crime \r\nof genocide.\r\nFor an entire century now, Armenians around \r\nthe globe and the entire progressive international \r\ncommunity have been waiting for Turkey to show \r\ncourage and face its own history by recognizing the \r\nArmenian genocide, thus relieving future generations \r\nof the heavy burden of the past. Alas, instead, we \r\n14-54711 33/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\ncontinue to hear ambiguous and messages with ulterior \r\nmotives, in which the victim and the slaughterer are set \r\non equal footing and history is falsified.\r\nArmenia has never made recognition of the \r\nArmenian genocide a condition for the normalization \r\nof bilateral relations with Turkey. In fact, Armenia was \r\nthe party that initiated that process of normalization, \r\nwhich in 2009 culminated in the signing of the Zurich \r\nprotocols. However, those protocols have been shelved \r\nfor years now, awaiting ratification in the Turkish \r\nParliament. Ankara has declared publicly that it will \r\nratify the protocols only if Armenians cede Nagorny \r\nKarabakh and Artsakh to Azerbaijan. In Armenia \r\nand Artsakh, ordinary people often simply retort: “To \r\nhell with your ratification.” This vernacular phrase \r\nsummarizes the age-old struggle of the entire nation \r\nand unequivocally explains to those who attempt to \r\nbargain with others’ homeland that the motherland is \r\nsacrosanct and they had better stay away from us with \r\ntheir bargain. It is in these circumstances that, currently, \r\nYerevan is seriously considering the issue of recalling \r\nthe Armenian-Turkish protocols from Parliament.\r\nThe tragic events in Syria and Iraq that we are \r\ncurrently witnessing demonstrate how groups whose \r\ncreed is hatred are targeting religious and national \r\nminorities. Two days ago, on Armenia’s independence \r\nday, the Saint Martyrs Armenian Church in Dayr \r\nAl-Zour, Syria, dedicated to the memory of the victims \r\nof the Armenian genocide, was mined and blown \r\nup by the terrorists. Such barbarity is a criminal \r\ndemonstration of godlessness, which is in no way or \r\nshape related to any faith. The catastrophic situation in \r\nSyria and northern Iraq continues to deteriorate, and \r\ntoday hundreds of thousands of people are directly in \r\nperil. Among them are tens of thousands of Armenians \r\nin Aleppo, Syria. It is one instance to consider in the \r\ncontext of our joint commitment to preventing crimes \r\nagainst humanity. Armenia has voiced on numerous \r\noccasions the need to defend the Armenian population \r\nof Syria and the Yazidi population of north-western \r\nIraq, and we are encouraged by the unified stance of \r\nthe international community in that regard.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity is the essence of our Organization. In recent \r\nyears, Armenia has consistently consolidated its \r\npeacekeeping capabilities thereby preparing ourselves \r\nfor more proactive engagement in that field. Armenian \r\npeacekeepers will very soon be dispatched to the south \r\nof Lebanon in the context of the United Nations Interim \r\nForce in Lebanon. The close collaboration we enjoy \r\nwith our Italian colleagues enabled our participation in \r\nthat endeavour. I strongly believe that our servicemen \r\nwill fulfil their mission with dignity and a high level of \r\nprofessionalism and will use the extensive experience \r\nthey have garnered in the last decade in Kosovo, Iraq \r\nand Afghanistan.\r\nIt has been more than 20 years that our neighbouring \r\nState, through its unconstructive and maximalist \r\nstance, has thwarted the international community’s \r\nefforts aimed at the just and peaceful settlement of the \r\nNagorno Karabakh conflict. The bellicose declarations \r\nand various threats made at the highest level in \r\nAzerbaijan have been completely tolerated on account \r\nof the international community’s failure to correctly \r\nassess them. The President of Azerbaijan has designated \r\nthe entire Armenian nation as enemy number one, and \r\nwhat is considered in the rest of the world to be a crime, \r\nin Azerbaijan is considered to be a heroic act.\r\nDespite the fact that each conflict is unique, \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, including \r\npeoples’ right to freely express their will and self-\r\ndetermination, continue to evolve as a determinant \r\nin their resolution. The vote held a few days ago in \r\nScotland once again proved that nowadays referendums \r\nare more and more widely perceived as a legal model \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of ethnic conflicts. It was \r\nno coincidence that the right to decide one’s own fate \r\nthrough a referendum is at the core of the proposal put \r\nforward by the co-Chairs of the Minsk Group of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) for the settlement of the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nconflict.\r\nWhile discussing the Nagorno Karabakh conflict \r\nsettlement, I must address the four Security Council \r\nresolutions — resolutions 822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 \r\n(1993) and 884 (1993) — adopted during the war, \r\nwhich every so often are exploited by the Azerbaijani \r\nauthorities in order to justify their obstructionist policy. \r\nThose four resolutions demand, as a matter of priority, \r\nthe unconditional cessation of all military hostilities. \r\nAzerbaijan has failed to comply. Azerbaijan’s own \r\nnon-compliance with the fundamental demands of the \r\nresolutions make their full implementation impossible. \r\nThe resolutions call on the parties to cease their \r\nbombardments and air strikes targeting the peaceful \r\ncivilian population and to refrain from violating \r\nthe principles of international humanitarian law. \r\nHowever, Azerbaijan has continued its indiscriminate \r\n34/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nbombardments of the civilian population. Azerbaijan \r\nhas not spared children, women or the elderly, \r\nthereby gravely violating all legal and moral norms \r\nof international humanitarian law. Now Azerbaijan \r\ncynically refers to those resolutions selectively — citing \r\nthem out of context as a prerequisite for the settlement \r\nof the conflict. An adequate interpretation of the \r\nSecurity Council resolutions is not possible without a \r\ncorrect understanding of the hierarchy of the demands \r\nset therein.\r\nThe resolutions, inter alia, request the restoration \r\nof economic, transport and energy links in the region \r\nand the removal of all obstacles to communications \r\nand transportation. It is no secret that Azerbaijan and \r\nTurkey imposed a blockade on Nagorno Karabakh and \r\nthe Republic of Armenia at the outset of the conflict. \r\nIn his statements, the Azerbaijani President even takes \r\npride in that fact, promising his public that such action \r\nwould remain the priority of Azerbaijan’s foreign \r\npolicy.\r\nThe aforementioned Security Council resolutions \r\ncall on Azerbaijan to establish direct contacts with \r\nNagorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan has refused to establish \r\nany direct contacts with Nagorno Karabakh, which \r\nwas a legally equal party to the ceasefire agreement \r\nconcluded in 1994, as well as a number of other \r\ninternational agreements. Moreover, Azerbaijan \r\npreaches hatred towards the people it claims it wants to \r\nsee as a part of its State.\r\nNone of the Security Council resolutions identifies \r\nArmenia as a conflicting party. Our country is called \r\nupon only to continue to exert its influence over the \r\nNagorno Karabakh Armenians in order to put an end \r\nto the conflict. Armenia has fully complied, and due \r\nto its efforts a ceasefire agreement was concluded in \r\n1994. All Security Council resolutions refer to Nagorno \r\nKarabakh as a party to the conflict.\r\nThe Azerbaijani authorities have failed to \r\nimplement the fundamental demands of the Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, including abiding by and adhering \r\nto the humanitarian norms. Incidentally, Azerbaijan has \r\noccasionally gravely violated that demand. Azerbaijan’s \r\ncruel and inhumane treatment of Armenian civilian \r\nprisoners of war regularly results in their deaths, \r\nalthough I imagine that no one would be surprised about \r\nthat, since Azerbaijan is the very State that suppresses \r\nand exercises the most inhumane treatment of its own \r\npeople. A clear proof of that was the decision of the \r\nSubcommittee on Prevention of Torture to suspend its \r\nvisit to Azerbaijan due to the obstructions it encountered \r\nin the conduct of the official Baku.\r\nThe OSCE Minsk Group is the only specialized \r\nstructure that has been dealing with the Nagorno \r\nKarabakh issue according to the mandate granted \r\nby the international community. While Azerbaijan \r\nknows that it could not possibly deceive or misinform \r\nthe Minsk Group, which is well aware of the essence \r\nof the problem, it attempts to transpose the conflict \r\nsettlement to other platforms by trying to depict it as \r\na territorial dispute or exploiting the factor of religious \r\nsolidarity. That is ironic, since Armenia traditionally \r\nenjoys very warm relations with the Islamic nations, \r\nboth in the Arabic-speaking world or, for instance, with \r\nour immediate neighbour Iran.\r\nWe highly value the indispensable role of the \r\nUnited Nations in the adjustment and implementation \r\nof the development goals. I strongly believe that, \r\nthrough the new post-2015 development agenda, we will \r\ncontinue our efforts to seek solutions and respond to \r\nglobal challenges, in accordance with the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline that we \r\nhave covered a substantial part of the path towards the \r\nshaping of the post-2015 development agenda and we \r\nwill continue our endeavours in that regard, displaying \r\nthe f lexibility necessary to bring the process to its \r\nlogical conclusion.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Armenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the Republic of \r\nArmenia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Arab Republic \r\nof Egypt.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, \r\n14-54711 35/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nPresident of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Al Sisi (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nit gives me pleasure to congratulate the President of the \r\nAssembly and his friendly country on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. We are confident that he will lead its \r\nwork wisely, and we will lend him our support as \r\nhe undertakes his duties. I take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my sincere appreciation to his predecessor for \r\nhis untiring efforts as President of the Assembly at its \r\nprevious session. I also reiterate our full support to the \r\nSecretary-General as he strives to realize the purposes \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI stand before the Assembly today as one of the sons \r\nof Egypt, from the cradle of human civilization. From \r\nthis rostrum, I first salute the great people of Egypt. \r\nAllow me to also salute the thousands of Egyptians who \r\ntravelled from Egypt and various parts of the United \r\nStates and who are in the city today to say that the \r\nnew Egypt is coming. From this rostrum, I salute the \r\ngreat people of Egypt, who have made history twice \r\nin the past few years: first, when they revolted against \r\ncorruption and despotism and claimed their right to \r\nfreedom, dignity and social justice; and then when they \r\nheld fast to their identity and, energized by patriotism, \r\nrose up against exclusion, refusing to succumb to the \r\ntyranny of a faction which, in the name of religion, put \r\nits narrow interests before the interests of the people.\r\nThose are simply snapshots of the defining \r\nmoments Egypt has witnessed recently. They are only \r\nmilestones in the longer journey that Egyptians, fuelled \r\nby their dreams and aspirations, have embarked upon, \r\ntowards a better day and a more prosperous future. The \r\nworld is starting to grasp the reality of what happened \r\nin Egypt and to understand the circumstances that \r\ndrove Egyptians to intuitively take to the streets to \r\nrebel against the forces of extremism and darkness \r\nthat, once in power, undermined the foundations of the \r\ndemocratic process and national institutions and sought \r\nto impose a state of polarization in order to break the \r\nunity of the people.\r\nThe upsurge in extremism and violence perpetrated \r\nin the name of religion that the region is currently \r\nwitnessing is evidence of the true objectives of those \r\ngroups that exploit religion. We have warned against \r\nthem over and over again. They have transformed the \r\nvalues of justice, compassion and mercy, which are \r\ntreasured by Judaism, Christianity and Islam, into grim \r\nsectarianism and destructive civil and regional wars \r\nthat continue to claim the lives of innocent people of \r\ndifferent religions.\r\nThe Egyptian people understand — as do I, given \r\nthe responsibilities that I have shouldered since my \r\nelection as President — that the path towards achieving \r\nour goals began with the building of a civil democratic \r\nState, guided by the principles we sought to embody \r\nand adhering to the road map for the future agreed upon \r\nby the Egyptian national powers. That road map will \r\nbe completed when parliamentary elections are held, \r\nfollowing the presidential election and constitutional \r\nreferendum through which Egyptians expressed their \r\nfree will. Our aim is to build a new Egypt — a State \r\nthat respects rights and freedoms, honours its duties \r\nand ensures the coexistence of its citizens without \r\nexclusion or discrimination; a State that respects and \r\nenforces the rule of law, guarantees freedom of opinion \r\nfor all and ensures freedom of belief and worship for \r\nits people; and a State that is determined to achieve \r\ngrowth, prosperity and a promising future that meets \r\nthe aspirations of its people.\r\nTo that end, Egypt began implementing an ambitious \r\ncomprehensive programme to spur development \r\nuntil 2030, with the aim of laying the foundations of \r\na free-market economy that is capable of attracting \r\ninvestments in a secure and stable environment. The \r\nNew Suez Canal project, a gift from Egyptians to the \r\nworld, is proof of the seriousness of our intent and of the \r\nresolve of the new Egypt to forge a better tomorrow for \r\nits youth. That is why I invite members to participate \r\nin the economic conference that will be held in Egypt \r\nin February 2015 to achieve development and build the \r\nfuture, not only for Egypt, but for the entire region.\r\nThose steps briefly reflect the gist of the social \r\ncontract embraced by Egyptians in their new \r\nConstitution. It is to build a better today and a brighter \r\ntomorrow for our youth and to establish a State that is \r\narmed with strong institutions and governed by the rule \r\nof law; a State that respects the judiciary and ensures its \r\nindependence and applies the principle of the separation \r\nof powers; and a State that is not held back by a form \r\nof terrorism that thinks that it can conquer and repress \r\nour nation.\r\nEgypt has suffered from the scourge of that \r\nterrorism since the 1920s, when it concealed its \r\npoisonous viewpoints behind religion to reach power \r\n36/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nand establish the caliphate state, relying on armed \r\nviolence and terror to achieve its objectives and in \r\nthe process giving rise to a handful of extremists who \r\ncommit atrocities in the name of religion. Here I stress \r\nthat we should not allow them to abuse Islam and offend \r\nthe 1.5 billion Muslims who cherish its noble values. \r\nReligion, by virtue of its holiness and sanctity, cannot \r\nbe put to the test by humans and judged whether it has \r\nsucceeded or failed.\r\nTerrorism is a plague that does not differentiate \r\nbetween developing and developed societies as it \r\nspreads. Terrorists come from different societies. They \r\nare not bound together by any true religious faith. \r\nThat is why it is imperative that we all intensify our \r\ncooperation and coordination efforts, pursuant to the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and in \r\nfulfilment of its objectives, to end the support provided \r\nto those terrorist organizations that enables them to \r\ncontinue perpetrating crimes.\r\nThe problems facing our region emanate from \r\nthe space provided to the local and regional forces of \r\nextremism and the state of polarization that often leads \r\nto division and strife. They have become a serious \r\ndanger that threatens the very existence of the State and \r\nattacks its identity. That has produced fertile ground \r\nfor terrorism and its organizations to grow and gain \r\ninfluence.\r\nIn this regard, the crises facing some countries \r\nof the region could be resolved by following a two-\r\npronged approach aimed at building the nation State. \r\nThe first is the application of the principles of equality \r\nof all citizens and respect for the rule of law, based on a \r\nsocial contract and national consensus, while ensuring \r\nthe enjoyment by all of all rights, especially the right \r\nto development. That will safeguard societies from \r\nexploitation and prevent them from succumbing to \r\nextremism. The second aspect is a decisive confrontation \r\nwith the forces of extremism and terrorism and with \r\nany attempt to impose opinions through intimidation \r\nand violence or to force exclusion through rejection in \r\nall its forms.\r\nEgypt, in agreement with Libya’s neighbouring \r\ncountries, has actually put forward an initiative that \r\nsets specific steps and a clear vision to end the plight \r\nof that kindred country. We can build on that initiative \r\nto achieve a comprehensive political solution that \r\nstrengthens Libya’s elected institutions and ensures an \r\nend to the bloodshed, while preserving its territorial \r\nintegrity. Success requires effectively halting arms \r\ntrafficking into Libya and dealing relentlessly with \r\nthe extremist movements that resort to weapons and \r\nviolence and do not recognize the democratic process.\r\nDespite the heartrending humanitarian situation in \r\nfraternal Syria and the destruction and loss of innocent \r\nlives resulting from the crisis, I am confident that it \r\nis possible to establish a political framework that will \r\nensure that the aspirations of the Syrian people are met \r\nwithout compromising with terrorism or replicating the \r\ncircumstances that the Syrians initially rebelled against. \r\nI emphasize that Egypt supports the Syrian people’s \r\naspirations to a safe and secure life that ensures Syria’s \r\nstability and the unity of its people and preserves its \r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nThe formation in the brotherly country of Iraq \r\nof a new Government approved by the Parliament is \r\na significant development that restores hope in the \r\npossibility of improving the situation and for success \r\nin internal and external attempts to achieve stability, \r\nrestore the areas that have fallen under the control of \r\nthe terrorist group Daesh, maintain Iraq’s territorial \r\nintegrity, end the bloodshed.\r\nDespite the multitude of crises threatening our \r\nregion, some of which I have mentioned, the Palestinian \r\nissue remains a top priority for Egypt. Palestinians \r\nstill aspire to establish their independent State on the \r\nterritories occupied in 1967, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, on the basis of the principles of the peace \r\nprocess that was established in the 1970s, following \r\nan Egyptian initiative. Those principles are not up for \r\ncompromise; otherwise the basis of a comprehensive \r\npeace in the region would erode and the values of \r\njustice and humanity would vanish. The continued \r\ndeprivation of the Palestinian people of their rights is \r\nundoubtedly exploited by some to inflame other crises, \r\nachieve hidden goals, fragment Arab unity and impose \r\ntrusteeship on Palestinians under the guise of realizing \r\ntheir aspirations.\r\nI am confident that certain challenges will \r\nrequire us to work seriously and with a clear vision \r\nto achieve the ambitions of our people for democracy, \r\ndevelopment and human dignity and for our youth and \r\ntheir aspirations for a brighter future. Our success will \r\nguarantee the future of our people.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I call upon everyone to address \r\nthe Ebola epidemic. In many African countries, \r\ncombatting the disease is a collective responsibility. We \r\nmust be able to assist those countries that need help, \r\n14-54711 37/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nwhile providing protection to our own people. Distances \r\nhave become shorter, due to modern advances, thus \r\nincreasing the threat. As a strong State, Egypt bears a \r\nspecial responsibility. In the 1990s, Egypt confronted \r\nterrorism and extremism. I am confident that it will \r\nsucceed in uprooting terrorism by virtue of its national \r\nidentity. Egypt will always be a beacon of civilization, \r\nsupporting cohesion in the region. Egyptians will never \r\nhesitate to assume their role to that effect.\r\nEgypt considers the security of the Arab States \r\nintegral to its national security, on the basis of our \r\ncommon heritage and destiny and our longing for the \r\nstability of a region that is important and crucial to \r\nthe world. Egypt’s vision of international relations is \r\nfounded on respect for the principles of international \r\nlaw, treaties and conventions, based on mutual respect \r\nand mutual interests and benefits.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, Egypt was a founding \r\nMember of the United Nations and has ever since \r\nstrongly contributed to realizing its goals, especially in \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding and development. From \r\nthat standpoint, Egypt’s aspiration to a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council in 2016 and 2017 stems \r\nfrom its desire to use its membership to achieve the \r\npurposes of the Organization and protect the interests \r\nof developing countries, especially in Africa, as well as \r\nto accelerate the reform of the United Nations system \r\nas part of a broader vision based on the principle of \r\nequality of all nations. I therefore invite Member States \r\nto support Egypt’s candidature for the Security Council.\r\nI have conveyed in all humility the message of the \r\nEgyptian people, women, men, youth and the elderly. \r\nIt is a message of hope, of will and of determination to \r\nwork. It is a message of openness, calling for cooperation \r\nwith all, to overcome all obstacles and difficulties. I \r\nwish to assure the Assembly that the Egyptian people, \r\nafter their two revolutions, have become the sole source \r\nof our internal and external policies in pursuit of \r\nstability and development.\r\nEgypt today has regained its self-confidence and is \r\nupholding the principles of law and freedom. With its \r\nArab identity and African roots, it is the cradle of the \r\nMediterranean civilization and the beacon of moderate \r\nIslam. Egypt aspires to resolve regional disputes and \r\nuphold the principles of justice and humanity in today’s \r\nworld. I am confident that Egyptians have an infinite \r\ncapacity to give. We have inherited that gift from our \r\nancestors and will remain ever generous, God willing.\r\nLong live Egypt. Long live the peace-loving peoples \r\nof the world. Long live the principles of humanity and \r\nthe values of tolerance and coexistence. May peace be \r\nupon the Assembly, and the mercy and blessings of God \r\nas well.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al \r\nHussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the King of the Hashemite Kingdom \r\nof Jordan.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, \r\nKing of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Abdullah (spoke in Arabic): What and where \r\nis global power? I say that global power is here in this \r\nHall, and it is ours if our countries work as one. That is \r\nthe great promise of the General Assembly. The times \r\ndemand that we exercise that power now and to the full.\r\nIn my region, the challenges have grown significantly \r\nsince I spoke here last year (see A/68/PV.5). Those \r\nwho say “This is not our business” are wrong. The \r\nsecurity of every nation will be shaped by the fate of \r\nthe Middle East. Together, we can and must undertake \r\nurgent humanitarian and security measures, create \r\ndurable solutions for today’s crises and provide new \r\nopportunities for dialogue, reconciliation, prosperity \r\nand peace.\r\nThe terrorists and criminals targeting Syria, Iraq \r\nand other countries today are extreme reflections of \r\na global threat. Our international community needs a \r\ncollective strategy to contain and to defeat those groups. \r\nMy country is at the forefront of that effort. We are \r\nleading a number of initiatives to counter extremism. \r\nAs the representative of the Asia-Pacific bloc on the \r\nSecurity Council, we seek a strong outcome of the \r\n38/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nSecurity Council summit on threats to international \r\npeace and security caused by terrorist acts, to be \r\nchaired by President Obama this afternoon.\r\nAnother critical global focus must be a decisive \r\naffirmation of mutual respect within and among \r\nreligions and peoples. The teachings of true Islam \r\nare clear: sectarian conflict and strife are utterly \r\ncondemned. Islam prohibits violence against Christians \r\nand the other communities that make up each country. \r\nLet me say once again that Arab Christians are an \r\nintegral part of my region’s past, present and future. \r\nI call on Muslim and other leaders to work together \r\nagainst falsehoods and divisive actions.\r\nJordan is honoured to have spearheaded global \r\ninterfaith and intrareligious initiatives. Building on \r\nthat, Jordan will introduce a draft resolution covering \r\nthe general proposal that a new international offence, \r\nfalling under the crimes of genocide and crimes against \r\nhumanity, be considered on the basis of the aberrant \r\nnew crimes against religious communities seen recently \r\nin Syria and in Iraq.\r\nTogether, let us also address the conditions that \r\nextremists exploit. Radicalization thrives on injustice, \r\ninsecurity and marginalization. The Assembly’s \r\ntransformative development agenda can give the \r\nworld’s people a better way forward through concrete \r\nprogrammes and investments that will change lives.\r\nWe must also work actively for consensus-driven \r\npolitical solutions to regional crises. The security \r\nsituation in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon must be addressed \r\ncomprehensively. Jordan supports a united and stable \r\nIraq with an inclusive national political process. In \r\nSyria, there must be a political solution based on \r\nreforms that give all communities a role in rebuilding \r\ntheir country. International influence is vital to bring \r\nthe moderate opposition and the regime back to the \r\nnegotiating table immediately.\r\nThe heavy f low of Syrian refugees continues. My \r\ncountry is sheltering nearly 1.4 million Syrians. We \r\nare now host to the world’s third-largest number of \r\nrefugees, and that is placing an overwhelming burden \r\non Jordan’s people, infrastructure and already limited \r\nresources. The refugee crisis is a recognized global \r\nresponsibility and demands a global solution. To date, \r\nthe response has not kept pace with the real needs. \r\nThere must be a concerted effort to get humanitarian \r\nassistance f lowing inside Syria and to support host \r\ncountries and communities, including Jordan.\r\nWe cannot address the future of my region without \r\naddressing its central conflict: the denial of Palestinian \r\nrights and statehood. This year, yet again, we have \r\nseen a dangerous halt in the progress towards peace \r\nand a Palestinian State. Instead, in Gaza, we have seen \r\nanother violent detour into conflict. How shall we heal \r\nthe families who have lost so much? How shall we offer \r\nhope to young people whose futures are at risk? A first \r\nimperative step is to mobilize international efforts to \r\nrebuild Gaza. As we do so, we must also marshal the \r\nunited global response needed to achieve a once-and-\r\nfor-all lasting settlement. Such action can create the \r\nenvironment necessary to relaunch the final status \r\nnegotiations on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nThat approach offers a clear path — the only \r\npath — to a comprehensive settlement based on the \r\ntwo-State solution, international legitimacy and the \r\nterms of reference. For Israel, it offers security and \r\nnormal diplomatic and economic relations with Arab \r\nand Muslim States and, for Palestinians, a viable and \r\nindependent sovereign State, within the 1967 lines, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. Unilateral actions \r\nthat seek to pre-empt negotiations must end. Jordan \r\nstrongly opposes threats to the Arab, Muslim and \r\nChristian identity of Jerusalem. As the Hashemite \r\ncustodian of Jerusalem’s Muslim and Christian Holy \r\nSites, I will continue to oppose any violation of the \r\nsanctity of the Al-Aqsa mosque.\r\nThe people of Palestine seek what all humans \r\nseek. It is the common cause of the General Assembly: \r\njustice, dignity, opportunity and hope. That is our \r\nglobal responsibility. It is in our global power, and we \r\nmust make it our global reality. Jordan stands ready to \r\ndo its part.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank His Majesty the King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. François Hollande, President of the \r\nFrench Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the French Republic.\r\n14-54711 39/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. François Hollande, \r\nPresident of the French Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Hollande (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will understand that I am speaking today \r\nwith particular emotion, because one of my compatriots \r\nhas just been the subject of a cowardly assassination in \r\nAlgeria by a terrorist group linked to Daesh. His name \r\nwas Hervé Gourdel. He was a man full of enthusiasm \r\nwho loved mountains and thought that he would be able \r\nto pursue his passion by going to the Djurdjura area in \r\nAlgeria. He was captured, and he was decapitated. That \r\nis what terrorism does. And it does not do that only to \r\nFrance. Several days ago it was American and British \r\nindividuals subjected to the same barbarity.\r\nThat group — Daesh — does not strike only those \r\nwho think differently from themselves; they also strike \r\nMuslims, they strike civilian populations, and they \r\nstrike minorities. They rape, they kill. That is why \r\nthe battle that the international community must wage \r\nagainst terrorism knows no borders. The same flag must \r\nbe carried, that of the United Nations, that of the values \r\nfor which this Organization was founded — human \r\ndignity, freedom, the vision we must have of a world of \r\ntomorrow, a world of justice.\r\nFrance is fully engaged in this battle. That was \r\nthe case in Africa when it was called to Mali, where, \r\nfortunately, it was joined by many African and European \r\ncountries and now by the United Nations. France has \r\nbeen engaged whenever there is a risk. But today it is \r\nin Iraq and Syria where that threat exists. But it does \r\nnot concern that region alone, because the Daesh group \r\nhas decided not only to conquer territory, imagining \r\nthat it will found a State; it threatens the entire world \r\nby provoking attacks, organizing kidnappings and \r\nrecruiting fighters from around the world to train them \r\nand show them the barbarity of which the group is \r\ncapable, so they may reproduce that horrific terrorist \r\nmovement in our own countries.\r\nIt is because this threat exists not only for the \r\nregion but for the world that France responded to the \r\nIraqi authorities’ appeal to provide them first with \r\nmilitary aid through the delivery of weapons this past \r\nAugust and also with aerial support to keep the Daesh \r\ngroup from being able to continue its advance. We want \r\nto weaken it. We want to quash it.\r\nBut we also know that as long as there is no \r\nsettlement of the Syrian crisis, all our efforts risk being \r\nundermined. So the challenge is not only to act against \r\nDaesh, but also to achieve a political solution. We in \r\nFrance support the democratic Syrian opposition. We \r\nconsider it the sole legitimate representative of the \r\nSyrian people. In that case, too, we will not back down; \r\nwe will not compromise because of threats. The Bashar \r\nAl-Assad regime deserves to be condemned because \r\nthey are complicit in what has been going on for the \r\npast three years in Syria — 200,000 deaths and so \r\nmany displaced persons.\r\nThis is a sad time for France, with the death — the \r\nmurder — of one of our citizens, but France will never \r\ngive in to blackmail, pressure or barbarous acts. On the \r\ncontrary, France knows what is expected of it. France \r\nknows that it upholds values, France knows it has a role \r\nto play and will never abandon that role, and that the \r\nfight against terrorism will be continued and expanded \r\nas much as necessary within respect for the rule of law \r\nand the sovereignty of States, for we make no mistake \r\nwhen we act. We will always act with respect for the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nI also wanted to talk to about other things, but \r\nit must be understood that a great question is being \r\nasked of my country and also of the Assembly. When \r\nfaced with barbarism, with terrorism, will we remain \r\nspectators, or will we be actors together in what should \r\nbe a just international order? The question, if we do \r\nnot respond to it, or if we respond too weakly, then \r\nterrorists will continue their business of recruitment \r\nand indoctrination. It is not weakness that will be the \r\nresponse to terrorism; it is force — the force of law, \r\nthe force of the United Nations. At a certain point also, \r\nit will be the force of military action when it becomes \r\nnecessary.\r\nI also wanted to talk about other regions of the \r\nworld that are facing threats that also affect our own \r\nsecurity. I want to talk to the Assembly about the Ebola \r\nepidemic, because I know just how much it is affecting \r\nour African friends. But again, let us look beyond those \r\nwho are affected. Who can imagine that the epidemic \r\nwill remain confined to just a few countries if we do \r\nnot intervene? It is also a global threat. Again, the \r\nresponse must be a global. Therefore, France, Europe \r\n40/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nand the world must provide to the countries affected by \r\nthe epidemic the necessary medical care, indispensable \r\nprotection and economic assistance that is expected. \r\nBecause again, if there is the slightest weakness, the \r\nslightest failure to show solidarity, all of our countries \r\nwill be affected.\r\nI have also come here before the General Assembly \r\nto speak about what is happening in Europe and next to \r\nEurope, to speak about what occurred in Ukraine and \r\nthe failures there to uphold principles of international \r\nlaw. But what is at stake today, even in Europe, is peace \r\nand ensuring that the ceasefire that was agreed can be \r\ntransformed into a lasting solution to the conflict.\r\nNo continent has been spared from any threat. \r\nEverything is fragile, everything is precarious, \r\neverything is vulnerable. We have to have the same \r\nawareness of the risks, the dangers and the perils that \r\nwe had right after the Second World War. We must not \r\nthink that all we have to do is remember; we have to \r\nthink of the future, of the world we want. The world \r\nthat we want is the final subject I wish to address here.\r\nThe world that we want has to be one of profound \r\nchange. The present disorder also threatens not only \r\nour generation but naturally those that will follow \r\nus. It threatens our very security, as there are more \r\ndisplaced persons resulting from climate imbalance \r\nthan from wars, which are sadly so intense and deadly \r\non our planet. France has lived up to its responsibilities \r\nin that area too. We decided to organize the climate \r\nconference in December 2015. I am pleased that thanks \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, there was a summit \r\nhere that mobilized awareness, States, financial \r\ninstitutions, businesses and civil society. Many events \r\ntook place. We have to succeed at the Paris conference, \r\nnot because it will take place in Paris, but because it is \r\nthe world’s appointment with itself.\r\nThere are periods in history when we have the \r\npower to decide, and decide not just for ourselves but \r\nfor humankind. This is one of those moments. Therefore \r\nin Paris, we have to do everything can be done to reach \r\na comprehensive, binding agreement that differentiates \r\naccording to levels of development, everything so that \r\nthere can be that Green Climate Fund, to which France \r\nhas contributed $1 billion for the coming years. I hope \r\nthat other countries follow our example, because we \r\nneed that Green Fund to allow less developed countries \r\nto grow and to succeed in their energy transition at the \r\nsame time.\r\nThis is a sad moment that I am living today on \r\nbehalf of France, that the French are experiencing, but \r\nit is also a moment of awakening and responsibility. For \r\nthe world, for the planet, we must fight terrorism, we \r\nmust act in favour of peace, we must reduce inequalities, \r\nwe must also do our duty for future generations. We \r\nmust ensure that the Paris conference is successful \r\nfor the sake of the climate. We must make certain that \r\nthe United Nations can remain faithful to the mandate \r\ngiven to it after a war — a terrible war. We are still \r\nfacing challenges, but we are certain to meet them if we \r\nare united and come together to claim victory.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the French \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Enrique Peña Nieto, \r\nPresident of the United Mexican States\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the United Mexican \r\nStates.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto, \r\nPresident of the United Mexican States, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Peña Nieto (spoke in Spanish): As \r\nPresident of Mexico, it is a high honour for me to \r\nparticipate for the first time in the General Assembly, \r\nthe greatest symbol of unity among nations. Mexico \r\nreiterates its historic commitment to this universal \r\nforum of dialogue, understanding and cooperation.\r\nToday’s world could not be imagined without \r\nthe United Nations. Its positive influence is present \r\nin all realms of our lives. The United Nations leads \r\ninternational efforts to combat hunger, pandemics and \r\nclimate change. It protects our children, preserves the \r\nheritage of humanity and furthers the empowerment \r\nand advancement of women around the world. The \r\nOrganization promotes trade and global communications \r\nas well as human rights and peace. Thanks to the United \r\n14-54711 41/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nNations, our world today enjoys greater freedom and is \r\nmore democratic and more developed.\r\nWhile United Nations contributions to the well-\r\nbeing of millions of people are indeed evident, one \r\ncannot deny the multiple challenges that every country \r\nof this planet is currently facing. From the global \r\neconomy that has yet to recover its dynamism, to \r\nregional conflicts that have caused deaths and forced \r\nmigration f lows, to climate change triggering natural \r\ndisasters, it is clear that the world requires multilateral \r\nresponses that are more effective.\r\nIn a world with so many phenomena that transcend \r\nborders, international cooperation is more necessary \r\nthan ever, and the sum of global efforts can emerge only \r\nhere, at the United Nations. Today, our planet needs \r\nto be able to depend on a more effective, efficient, \r\ntransparent and representative United Nations, where \r\nall societies of the world have greater participation. The \r\nUnited Nations must dare to change in order to improve.\r\nIn Mexico, we firmly believe that the United \r\nNations has all the attributes to be more daring and self-\r\nrenewing. With respect to institutional change, we need \r\na Security Council that evolves and that truly represents \r\nthe new world equilibrium. It is important to reform \r\nthe Council in order to strengthen its transparency, \r\naccountability and capacity to respond. We believe that \r\nthe Security Council should be enlarged by increasing \r\nthe number of non-permanent members, creating long-\r\nterm seats with the possibility of immediate re-election \r\nas part of a more equitable geographic representation. \r\nThe world needs a United Nations where the permanent \r\nmembers of the Council refrain from using the veto in \r\ncases of grave violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw.\r\nWith respect to international peace and security, \r\nthe United Nations must prevent arms trafficking \r\nand the serious damage that phenomenon inflicts on \r\nour societies. The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) provides \r\nthe tools to tackle that growing challenge. However, \r\nit is vital that all nations sign the Treaty, but, more \r\nimportantly, that they all ratify it. The First Conference \r\nof States Parties to the ATT will be held in Mexico next \r\nyear. It will be a great opportunity for all nations to \r\nwork together to prevent arms from hurting children or \r\nvulnerable populations around the world.\r\nSimilarly, we must also strengthen the United \r\nNations so that it can effectively combat terrorism, \r\nwhich is lacerating societies around the world.\r\nIn addition, we need the United Nations to renew \r\nits efforts for nuclear disarmament. We must prevent \r\nmore countries or non-State actors from having that \r\ndestructive capacity within reach, and we must also \r\ndemand that those already possessing it reduce and \r\neliminate those weapons. If we want a safer world, \r\nno one should use or threaten to use nuclear power to \r\nendanger the very survival of humankind itself.\r\nI turn next to the development agenda. Now that \r\nthe date is approaching to define the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, we need a United Nations with a \r\nbroader vision of the well-being of individuals. The \r\npost-2015 development agenda must recognize that \r\npoverty is not determined solely by insufficient income, \r\nbut also by other scarcities that impede personal and \r\ncollective development. Furthermore, we believe that \r\neconomic and social inclusion should be one of the \r\nprincipal points of the agenda.\r\nThe United Nations also needs to update its \r\ncommitment to the rights of girls, boys and adolescents, \r\naddressing new challenges that threaten their integrity. \r\nWe should initiate at the global level a joint initiative \r\nto combat harassment at school, or psychological \r\nharassment like bullying, and at the same time reinforce \r\nbasic values among our children and youths. If we want \r\nfor tomorrow a world in which adults have a spirit of \r\nempathy, understanding, friendship among peoples, \r\npeace and universal brotherhood, we need to act now \r\nwith more determination so that our children and our \r\nyouth can live free from any type of abuse.\r\nIn short, to address the challenges of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, we need a United Nations with a new \r\ninstitutional design, with a renewed commitment to \r\npeace and security and, above all, with a comprehensive \r\nand inclusive development agenda. Change is never \r\neasy, especially when it demands a fundamental \r\ntransformation and when it depends on the cooperation \r\nof multiple actors, each with its own priorities and \r\ninterests. In the specific case of the United Nations, \r\nmultiple voices acknowledge the need for a change, but \r\nat the same time, they believe it is an impossible task \r\nbecause no one is willing to yield.\r\nIn Mexico, we experienced a similar situation. \r\nThere were those who agreed on the urgency of \r\npromoting structural changes domestically, but they \r\nalso warned that it would not be possible to carry \r\nthem out. Those voices affirmed that political groups \r\nand the Government of the republic would not be able \r\nto reach agreement in order to transform our nation. \r\n42/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nNonetheless, Mexico demonstrated that it is possible to \r\nbuild with a plurality, that diversity is a strength when \r\nthere is a readiness for a constructive dialogue. The \r\nfoundation for achieving that was the Pact for Mexico, \r\nan agreement under which all essential commitments \r\nwere formed in order to advance a broad agenda for \r\nreforms in a various spheres of the national life.\r\nBuilding upon that innovative political instrument, \r\nMexicans dared to improve the quality of education, \r\nto make the job market more f lexible and to combat \r\nmonopolies and anti-competitive practices. We dared \r\nto modernize the telecommunications sector, to \r\nincrease the opportunities for credit and reduce its \r\ncost, to strengthen public finances and to initiate a \r\nnew model for energy development for the country. We \r\nMexicans held dialogues and agreed on the renewal \r\nof our political and electoral institutions and of our \r\njustice system and accountability system. We decided \r\nto transform ourselves. Those profound changes were \r\ndecades overdue, because no political party has held \r\na majority in Congress in past years. Nevertheless, \r\nthrough dialogue and consensus it was possible to \r\nachieve those changes in just 20 months.\r\nWhat was the principal difference from the \r\npast? It was the will of an entire nation that dared to \r\nchange. Mexico acted decisively and wisely. It dared \r\nto transform itself and to set itself in motion. On the \r\nbasis of that experience, I am convinced that the United \r\nNations can also change.\r\nAlmost 70 years after its creation, the United \r\nNations must evolve, as the world has evolved. I know \r\nit will not be easy to build consensus to succeed, \r\nbecause inertia must be broken and paradigms must \r\nbe changed. But I also know that the talent, the vision \r\nand the audicity needed to achieve that do exist. It is \r\ntime to build a new United Nations for a new century. \r\nThat will require that all States have the will to listen, \r\ndiscuss and tolerate and the capacity to yield. At the \r\nend of that process, the world will have more a efficient \r\nOrganization, a United Nations that is able to work \r\nsuccessfully in favour of the peace and development of \r\nthe planet. My country is ready to play an active role in \r\nthe transformation. It is determined to evolve with the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMexico supports and values peacekeeping \r\noperations, a United Nations instrument that assists \r\ncountries to overcome conflicts and create conditions \r\nfor sustainable peace by providing the means for \r\nreconstruction, humanitarian aid and security. That is \r\nwhy Mexico has decided to participate in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, providing humanitarian work \r\nto benefit civilian populations. Our participation will \r\nbe in keeping with a clear mandate from the Security \r\nCouncil and with the foreign-policy norms established \r\nin our Constitution. With such determination, Mexico, \r\nas a responsible stakeholder, will take a historic step in \r\nits commitment to the United Nations.\r\nNext year, the Organization will reach its seventieth \r\nanniversary. That will offer us a great opportunity to \r\nmake our plurality both an asset and a strength for \r\nchange. With the participation of all, with the drive and \r\nthe boldness of the Member States, the United Nations \r\ncan transform itself to benefit the whole of humanity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nMexican States for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sauli Niinistő, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nFinland.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of \r\nthe Republic of Finland, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Niinistö: The events of the past months \r\nfill us with sadness. We have entered another grim \r\nera of conflicts. What has happened in Ukraine and \r\nin Syria and Iraq illustrates that. The core values and \r\nrules on which the United Nations is based have been \r\nviolated. The crisis in Ukraine has a deep impact on \r\nthe security of Europe. We have not experienced such \r\nbreakdown since the tragedy of the Balkan wars. But I \r\nwant to stress that Ukraine is not only a question limited \r\nto Europe. It should — and eventually will — concern \r\nall of us.\r\n14-54711 43/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nA rule-based international system is a precondition \r\nfor peace and security, for human rights and \r\ndevelopment. If we cease to protect this system, it \r\nwill cease to protect us. It would be a dramatic and \r\nfar-reaching mistake to let our rule-based order slip \r\ntowards chaos and the law of the jungle. Unfortunately, \r\nthe Security Council has not been able to uphold its \r\nresponsibilities either in Ukraine or in Syria. We need \r\nto reform the Security Council. Finland supports the \r\nefforts to restrict the use of veto.\r\nI am pleased that the General Assembly adopted \r\nresolution 68/262, entitled “Territorial integrity of \r\nUkraine”, on 27 March, by a clear majority. Yet the \r\nvoice of this important body should have been even \r\nstronger, condemning Russia’s actions and charting \r\na way towards ending violence and restoring peace. \r\nWhen the territorial integrity of a Member State \r\nis violated and it loses control over a part of its own \r\narea through an illegal annexation, the Member State \r\nshould be able to turn to the United Nations for justice \r\nand remedy. De-escalation in Ukraine cannot happen \r\nwithout Russia’s active steps. Russia should control its \r\nborder and prevent the f low of arms and fighters and \r\nthereby contribute to stabilization of the situation in \r\neastern Ukraine. Only a political solution can solve this \r\ncrisis. We have recently seen some steps towards that, \r\nbut a lot still remains to be done.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has reminded us, the \r\ninternational community must not abandon the people \r\nof Syria. We cannot forget those who have died or those \r\ndriven from their homes — half of the population of \r\nSyria. Three million Syrians have been received as \r\nrefugees in the neighbouring countries. The Syrian \r\nconflict can be solved only by political means. Finland \r\ncontinues to give its full support to the United Nations \r\nSpecial Envoy for Syria. Women in Syria, as in other \r\nconflict-driven countries, must be included in the \r\npeace process. We welcome women’s active efforts to \r\nstrengthen their voices in Syria and eslewhere.\r\nThe war in Syria has severely affected the \r\nsecurity situation in the whole region. The geographic \r\nexpansion of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \r\norganization, with its horrendous terror, is a by-product \r\nof the conflict. That situation has serious consequences \r\nlocally, regionally and internationally. That challenge \r\nmust be tackled together through wide-ranging \r\ninternational cooperation. Finland will contribute to \r\nthose common efforts.\r\nThe international community showed determination \r\nlast autumn after the chemical attacks in Syria. The \r\nOrganization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-\r\nUnited Nations Joint Mission for the Elimination of \r\nthe Chemical Weapons Programme of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic focused on the verification and destruction \r\nof Syria’s chemical weapons programme. Finland has \r\nworked alongside the Joint Mission in that demanding \r\noperation. We must remain vigilant. In order to fulfil \r\nits United Nations commitments as well as to comply \r\nwith the Chemical Weapons Convention, Syria must \r\ntake further action. We must show that determination \r\nagain. I strongly reiterate the appeal to the Security \r\nCouncil to refer the Syrian situation to the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). The ICC must be used when the \r\nnational justice system is not able to deliver.\r\nMrs. Perceval (Argentina), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThose conflicts are unfolding at a time when \r\ncooperation and common efforts are more needed \r\nthan ever. We share the same global challenges, such \r\nas climate change. Ebola is another serious threat. To \r\nhelp, Finland will double its assistance. It is critically \r\nimportant to us and our planet that we address them \r\ntogether. Here, I want to express my gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for his leadership in addressing \r\nthose challenges.\r\nIntergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \r\nagenda will commence soon. We should aspire to a new \r\nkind of global commitment to fulfil both the needs of \r\nmankind and planet Earth. We owe this to our children \r\nand their children. To achieve sustainable development, \r\nwe need clear objectives. We need to be able to monitor \r\nour commitments in an efficient way. All resources \r\nand means should be mobilized. We cannot rely only \r\non traditional resources any more. Public funding for \r\ndevelopment is still important for the poorest and those \r\naffected by conflicts. But at the same time, domestic \r\nresource mobilization, innovation, trade and technology \r\nand investments must play a stronger role in sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nMany countries of the global South enjoy a robust \r\neconomic growth. That provides an opportunity to \r\ninvest in tax systems, which in turn generates public \r\nresources for sustainable development. A just tax and \r\nredistribution policy is one of the most efficient ways \r\nto reduce inequalities and fight marginalization. The \r\nrule of law and the fight against corruption play a huge \r\nrole as well.\r\n44/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nI trust the Secretary-General to be both \r\nvisionary and concrete when setting the scene for \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. This process \r\nwill culminate next year in this very Hall. The best \r\nway to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations next year is to adopt transformative \r\ncommitments that set us on a path towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nI started by describing the grim state of international \r\nrelations. My analysis is not an excuse for inaction, but \r\na call to redouble our diplomatic efforts. We must act \r\nwith determination, and we must act now. Finland will \r\nsupport efforts to restore peace and prevent further \r\ndamage to our rule-based international system. We \r\nmust also aim high in addressing together the broader \r\nglobal challenges of climate change and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Finland for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Indonesia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Susilo \r\nBambang Yudhoyono, President of the Republic of \r\nIndonesia, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Yudhoyono: It is a great honour for \r\nme to stand once again before the Assembly — the \r\nlast time I shall do so in my two terms as President of \r\nIndonesia. I could not agree more with the theme chosen \r\nfor this session, “Delivering on and implementing a \r\ntransformative post-2015 development agenda”, which \r\nis very much in line with the work of the High-level \r\nPanel I have been privileged to co-chair.\r\nFor the past 15 years, the international community \r\nhas been working on a grand and ambitious project \r\nfor humankind, the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Our hard work over the years has produced \r\nachievements that include breakthroughs in combating \r\npoverty, increasing school enrolment and improving \r\npublic health. Those achievements are encouraging and, \r\nin some instances, inspiring. But humankind as a whole \r\nhas not achieved all the MDG targets. The successes \r\nhave been uneven, differing between regions, within \r\nregions and even within countries. We have come a \r\nlong way, yet we still have a long way to go.\r\nFor those who have made it, as well as for those \r\nwho have yet to make it, I have learned one great lesson, \r\nwhich is that the most important driver of change \r\nlies in governance — not just good governance, but \r\nsmart governance. Smart governance usually involves \r\ninnovative leadership and active public participation. \r\nWithout at least those two elements, all the hard work \r\nwe put in will not produce the desired results. And with \r\nsmart governance, nations can exceed their potential \r\nand leapfrog over others ahead of them. In Indonesia we \r\nhave managed to increase our national per capita income \r\nby 400 per cent within just one decade, something that \r\nwas beyond our wildest imagination.\r\nThe quest to achieve the MDGs over the past \r\n15 years has also reinforced the need for a more robust \r\nglobal partnership. There has certainly been much \r\nactivity. But somehow, our efforts in the World Trade \r\nOrganization, on the post-Kyoto climate, on reforming \r\nthe global financial architecture and the United Nations \r\nand in many other areas have proved painfully slow.\r\nAs we set forth a new global agenda for development, \r\nI believe we can draw on those years of trial and error to \r\nbecome more acutely aware of the promises and pitfalls \r\nof development, and of what we want and what we do \r\nnot want. We do not want development that measures \r\nprogress in terms of material possessions alone and \r\nends up dehumanizing and marginalizing our citizens. \r\nWhat we want is sustainable development with equity.\r\nYet the importance of our work lies beyond the \r\nissue of development, since we are now also confronted \r\nwith yet another major problem. We are witnessing a \r\nworrying deterioration in the relations between the \r\nmajor Powers. None of us, certainly not the United \r\nNations, can afford to bury our heads in the sand about \r\nthat grim development.\r\n14-54711 45/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nIt is especially worrying, given that for more than \r\ntwo decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world \r\nactually witnessed a series of promising events. Most \r\nfundamental was the fact that improved relations among \r\nthe major Powers created ample space for new strategic \r\nand economic opportunities. Global trade totals have \r\nreached $23 trillion, an almost six-fold expansion since \r\nthe year after the Cold War ended in 1990. The fastest \r\ngrowth — one and a half times as fast as during the \r\npreceding two decades — was from 2000 to 2013, the \r\nperiod that coincided with our work on the MDGs. The \r\nvalue of global investments reached almost $1.5 trillion \r\nin 2013 for a near seven-fold increase since 1990.\r\nIn South-East Asia, that positive geopolitical \r\ndevelopment has allowed us to develop stronger \r\ncooperation and to develop the region’s architecture. \r\nIt led to the establishment of the East Asia Summit, a \r\nvision for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) community, a progressive ASEAN Charter, \r\na more active ASEAN Regional Forum and other \r\ninstitutions. And Indonesia has also been able to develop \r\nstrategic partnerships with all the major Powers as well \r\nas with many emerging Powers.\r\nToday I see that the international community \r\nis concerned about the danger of the old Cold War \r\nreturning. Major-Power relations are worsening, \r\nfuelled by mutual suspicion. Relationships that were \r\npreviously stable and cooperative are now marked by \r\nvolatility and tension. That benefits no one, and we \r\nshould therefore not let it become permanent. The \r\nmajor Powers — indeed, all of us — have an obligation \r\nto work together to resolve the major issues of our time. \r\nTo mention only a few, we must end the suffering of \r\nthe Palestinians in Gaza and the rest of the occupied \r\nterritory and deliver the still elusive two-State solution. \r\nWe must resolve the conflict in Ukraine that is now \r\nupsetting relations between Russia and the West. And \r\nwe must find an effective and durable solution to the \r\nongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq.\r\nTo do all of this, there must be mutual \r\naccommodation. There must be a forward-looking \r\nattitude that embraces a win-win predisposition \r\nrather than a zero-sum attitude. Diplomacy must take \r\nprecedence. The deficit of trust must be transformed \r\ninto strategic opportunities and confidence-building. \r\nIt is not enough just to call for peaceful coexistence. \r\nThat is so twentieth century. Here in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, we need much more than conditions in which \r\nworld Powers merely peacefully coexist. We need those \r\nPowers to work passionately together in order to foster \r\nstrategic cooperation and to tackle global issues. They \r\nmust begin to turn the trust deficit into a new strategic \r\ntrust not only among themselves but also with emerging \r\nPowers and with all nations of the United Nations. Is \r\nthat possible? I would say a resolute yes, for that is \r\nwhat has transpired in South-East Asia. In the second \r\nhalf of the 1960s, South-East Asian nations were poor, \r\ndivided and insecure, threatened by a war raging in \r\ntheir neighbourhood and ignorant of one another after \r\ncenturies of separation during the colonial past.\r\nThe establishment of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations enabled countries in the region to form \r\nthe habit of dialogue and consultation with one another \r\nand to learn to trust one another. Today, we can proudly \r\nsay that the once-divided 10 South-East Asian nations \r\nnow belong to ASEAN-10. Together, they are all drivers \r\nof regional affairs and masters of their own destiny. A \r\nnumber of sensitive inter-State and intra-State conflicts \r\nhave been peacefully resolved. Those that remain are \r\nbeing addressed through dialogue and negotiation. \r\nEconomic interdependence has become the norm of the \r\nday.\r\nMoreover, South-East Asia is on the verge of \r\nbecoming a true community. We regard that as the apex \r\nof strategic trust, which we believe can be replicated \r\neverywhere. The culture of peace and coexistence \r\nthat we are trying to attain in Indonesia and in the \r\nASEAN region is clearly the antidote to the poison \r\nof fundamentalist prejudice and deep intolerance, as \r\npractised by a terrorist group in Iraq and Syria that \r\nfalsely defines itself as the Islamic State. The ideology \r\nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant not only \r\nbetrays the true teaching of Islam as a religion of peace \r\nbut also harms and seriously upsets the Islamic Ummah \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIt has been a great privilege to forge closer bonds \r\nbetween Indonesia and all nations represented in this \r\ngreat assembly, the United Nations. As I look back, \r\nI must admit that there remain many challenges that \r\nIndonesia must resolve. Some of our efforts are already \r\non the right track. In a world desperately grappling \r\nwith climate change, we are progressively and boldly \r\napplying a moratorium on deforestation — our \r\nimportant contribution to reducing carbon emission. In \r\na world of economic uncertainty, we have increased our \r\nnational income per capita by 400 per cent within just \r\na short decade.\r\n46/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nIn a world witnessing rising extremism, Indonesia \r\ncontinues to hold firm to the values of freedom, \r\ntolerance, moderation and multiculturalism, which \r\nform the basis of our nationhood. In a world still \r\nburdened by insurgencies, we have managed to find \r\na permanent peaceful political solution to end the \r\n30-year conflict in Aceh province. In a world marked \r\nby turbulent transitions in the Middle East, time and \r\nagain we have shown to our people and to the world \r\nthat, in Indonesia, democracy, Islam, modernity and \r\nhuman rights go together.\r\nIn a world often stigmatized by the past, Indonesia \r\nhas opened a entire new chapter of peaceful relations \r\nwith Timor-Leste on the basis on equality and mutual \r\nrespect. In a world where territorial disputes often \r\nerupt into open conflicts, Indonesia has continued to \r\npeacefully resolve, one by one, the overlapping maritime \r\nborders with Vietnam, the Philippines, Singapore and \r\nother nations.\r\nThe Indonesian and South-East Asian experiences \r\nunderscore the dawn of a new age of globalism for the \r\ntwenty-first century — a world that openly embraces \r\nchange as opposed to being intimidated by it. What the \r\nworld so desperately needs today is a pioneering spirit: \r\nthe boldness to break old boundaries and to create new \r\nfrontiers. Given that spirit, I believe that humankind \r\ncan overcome the challenge of climate change, conquer \r\npoverty, eradicate social injustice, hasten the global \r\neconomic recovery and create a culture of peace among \r\nall religions, including the Abrahamic faiths. In that \r\nspirit, we can, hopefully, end the cycle of violence, \r\nhatred, fear and humiliation that has made so many \r\nconflicts around the world seem intractable for decades \r\nand centuries.\r\nIn saying that, I am neither a Utopian nor a blind \r\nidealist in understanding international relations. \r\nHowever, I believe that, with a strong commitment and \r\npolitical will, we can make the impossible possible. As \r\nwe say in Indonesia, where there is a will, there is a \r\nway. We must drive the frontiers of nationalism into \r\na new globalism, where we can devise solutions to \r\nnational, regional and global issues at the same time. \r\nWe must achieve a new globalism, where no nation is \r\nleft behind and no nation dominates and where rights \r\nare protected and responsibilities are met. In the world \r\nof a new globalism, wars are unthinkable. In the first \r\nplace, wars are fought because nations play a zero-\r\nsum game, where the winners take all and the losers \r\nweep — the game of us against them, which the “us” \r\nmust win and the “them” must lose. Winners today are \r\nlosers tomorrow.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that now is the time for \r\nall of us to start the serious business of building a new \r\nworld of peace, prosperity and justice and of making \r\neverybody a winner by creating and nurturing the new \r\nall-inclusive “we” that leaves no one behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Indonesia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Cristina Fernández, President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic.\r\nMs. Cristina Fernández, President of Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Cristina \r\nFernández, President of the Argentine Republic, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Fernández (spoke in Spanish): I address \r\nthe General Assembly at a very special moment, not \r\nonly for the world but also for my country. I would \r\nlike to begin by reflecting on the words with which \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon opened this sixty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly. He went over \r\nmany of the problems, tragedies and calamities that are \r\nunsettling the world today, and I think, if I remember \r\ncorrectly, that he literally confirmed that the turmoil, \r\nas he defined it, that is upsetting the world today is \r\nendangering multilateralism.\r\nI sincerely believe that most of the problems that \r\nthe planet has today economically and financially, with \r\nrespect to terrorism and security, in terms of force and \r\nterritorial integrity, of war and peace, are the result \r\nof the exact opposite: the absence of an effective, \r\npractical and democratic multilateralism. That is why, \r\nI would like to begin today in particular by thanking \r\nand congratulating the General Assembly for adopting \r\n14-54711 47/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nresolution 68/304, on 9 September, by which it finally \r\ndecided by a wide majority of 124 votes to dedicate \r\nitself to drafting a multilateral convention which will \r\nbe a regulatory legal framework for restructuring the \r\nsovereign debts of all countries, a task that we needed \r\nto take on.\r\nI have been coming to the General Assembly since \r\n2003, first as a Senator, and then, starting in 2007, as \r\nPresident. We always came calling for reform of the \r\nSecurity Council and of the International Monetary \r\nFund. Our point of departure was the experience we had \r\nin my country, the Argentine Republic. Today, I would \r\ngo so far as to say in this international context that my \r\ncountry, the Argentine Republic, is a triple leading \r\ncase in terms of economics and finance, terrorism and \r\nsecurity, and force and territorial integrity.\r\nThe first area is the economic and financial crisis \r\nthat spread throughout the world starting in 2008, \r\nwhich persists to this day and which is beginning to \r\nthreaten emerging economies whose greater economic \r\ngrowth we have supported over the past decade. The \r\n2008 crisis was experienced by my country in 2001, \r\nwhen the largest default on sovereign debt in living \r\nmemory occurred. At the time, the Argentine Republic \r\nhad accrued debt representing 160 per cent of the gross \r\ndomestic product, with the consent of multilateral \r\norganizations, because when one is speaking about that \r\nlevel of debt, the problem is not just that of the debtor, \r\nbut also of the creditors.\r\nStarting with the dictatorship on 24 March 1976, \r\nand through the neoliberal period, Argentina was a \r\nfavourite of the International Monetary Fund. In the \r\nend, Argentina accumulated an unprecedented debt \r\nthat caused the country to implode, not just in economic \r\nterms but also in political terms. We had five presidents \r\nin a single week. At that point, nobody claimed \r\nresponsibility for what had taken place in Argentina. \r\nArgentina had to resolve its problems as best it could, \r\nand in 2003, a few months after taking office, a President \r\nwho had come to head the Government with only 22 per \r\ncent of the vote came to speak at the General Assembly \r\n(see A/58/PV.11) and maintained that it was necessary \r\nto generate a model of development and growth for the \r\ncountry so that the country could shoulder its debt. \r\nHe maintained, in a rather interesting metaphor, that \r\ndead people do not pay their debts and that countries \r\nhave to live, develop and grow in order to meet their \r\nobligations.\r\nBut he also said that the level of debt — 160 per cent \r\nof the gross domestic product — was not our country’s \r\nresponsibility alone; that we as a country were accepting \r\nresponsibility for having adopted policies that had \r\nbeen forced upon us; that while we were shouldering \r\nour responsibility, we were also requesting and calling \r\nfor the multilateral organizations like the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the creditors themselves, which \r\nhad lent money at usurious rates — at that time as high \r\nas 14 per cent in United States dollars — which were \r\nreceiving payments in the Argentine Republic, to also \r\nassume part of the responsibility for that indebtedness.\r\nAnd with that man — who took over with 22 per \r\ncent of the vote, with 25 per cent unemployment, a \r\n54 per cent poverty rate and 27 per cent of extreme \r\npoverty, without education, without health, without \r\nsocial security, over time, with a model of development \r\nand growth — we were able not only to create millions \r\nof jobs, millions of people becoming integrated in \r\nthe social security system, including retirees and \r\npensioners, but also to invest 6 per cent of the gross \r\ndomestic product in education, and set aside enormous \r\namounts of money for the country’s infrastructure, \r\nbuilding roads, schools, nuclear plants, hydroelectric \r\nplants, water, gas and electricity plants that now cover \r\nthe entire country, in an unprecedented programme of \r\nsocial inclusion that has allowed to reduce poverty and \r\nextreme poverty to single digits.\r\nToday, the International Monetary Fund itself \r\nrecognizes that Argentina’s economic growth between \r\n2004 and 2011 is the third-largest globally in terms of \r\nquality of growth. Only Bulgaria and China are ahead \r\nof us. In Latin America, we have the greatest quality of \r\ngrowth and the best purchasing power for our workers \r\nand salaried employees and the highest social security \r\ndeposits.\r\nWe have been able to achieve all of that while \r\nalso dealing with debt that others had generated. It is \r\nworth repeating that our Governments were not the \r\nones that declared a default, nor were they the ones \r\nthat had assumed the debt; we were simply the ones \r\nwho shouldered the debt, as appropriate, and paid, from \r\n2003 to today, more than $190 billion — I repeat, more \r\nthan $190 billion — by restructuring the defaulted debt \r\nwith 92.4 per cent of creditors through two debt swaps, \r\none carried out by President Kirchner in 2005 and the \r\nother carried out by me in 2010.\r\nWhat is certain is that we were successful. We \r\nsucceeded because 92.4 per cent of Argentina’s \r\n48/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\ncreditors regularized their situation. We began to \r\nmake regular payments, and not only to them. We \r\nalso fully paid our debt to the International Monetary \r\nFund through so-called stand-by arrangements. We \r\nwere able to completely cancel our debt with the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund. A few months ago, we \r\nalso concluded negotiations with the Paris Club on \r\na debt dating back to 1956. It was so long ago that I \r\nwas three years old when that debt was created and the \r\nMinister of the Economy of my country, who discussed \r\nthe restructuring and renegotiation of the debt with \r\nthe Paris Club, was not even born. Yet we reached an \r\nagreement with 19 European Union finance ministers \r\nto finally restructure the debt. We are now paying the \r\nfirst phase of $642 million.\r\nThis does not end there. We also regularized the \r\nsituation with the rulings of the International Centre \r\nfor Settlement of Investment Disputes at the World \r\nBank, which has begun hearings not for acts or actions \r\ncommitted by our Government, but for the actions \r\nof previous Governments that ended up in the World \r\nBank tribunal. We have also resolved that issue, just \r\nas we arrived at an arrangement with Repsol when we \r\ndecided to regain control of our energy resources and \r\nexpropriated 51 per cent of the oil company’s shares. We \r\nalso restructured that debt and reached an agreement.\r\nWe have done all this with our own resources, \r\nwithout access to capital markets because Argentina, \r\ndue to the default of 2001, was denied access to capital \r\nmarkets. This represents a process of unprecedented \r\nsocial inclusion. Why do I say “unprecedented”? \r\nDuring the 1950s there were similar inclusion \r\nprocesses in my country, but the difference is that we \r\ninitiated this process of inclusion after complete and \r\nutter bankruptcy. At the peak of default, we were able \r\nto overcome default, to include the people of Argentina \r\nand to enjoy social growth with inclusion. And today \r\nArgentina is extricating itself, and in addition we have \r\none of the lowest debt ratios in the world.\r\nThe other leading case to which I referred and now \r\nwish to discuss is the emergence of the so-called vulture \r\nfunds. That is not a term used by any popular South \r\nAmerican leader or by any African ruler, although \r\nAfrican countries have also been major victims of \r\nthese vulture funds. One of the first global leaders to \r\nmention them was the former English Prime Minister \r\nGordon Brown at the General Assembly in 2002. This \r\nexpression became the copyrighted shorthand for \r\nsomething unworthy and immoral that kept countries \r\nfrom addressing the genuine problems of education, \r\nhealth and poverty. Today, with the support of the \r\njudicial system of this country, Argentina is now being \r\nassaulted by these vulture funds.\r\nWhat are these vulture funds? They represent the \r\n1 per cent of debt-holders that did not take part in the \r\n2005 restructuring. They could not participate because \r\nthey had purchased bonds in 2008. As everyone knows, \r\nthese are specialized funds, as indicated by their \r\nnames, that purchased funds or shares of countries \r\nthat had defaulted on their debt or were about to do \r\nso. Subsequently, they did not revert to the country in \r\nquestion for the payment of that debt, but brought suits \r\nin various jurisdictions in order to make exorbitant \r\nprofits. “Profits” is hardly the right word, because what \r\nhas been recognized in a judgment passed down here \r\nin the jurisdiction of New York is that this 1 per cent \r\ngrew at a rate of 1,608 per cent in a five-year period. \r\nIs there any business, undertaking or investor earning \r\n1,600 per cent in just five years? That is why they are \r\ncalled vulture funds. Today, they are obstructing the \r\nrecovery of that 92.4 per cent who trusted in Argentina.\r\nI am therefore pleased that the Assembly has taken \r\nthe bull by the horns, and I hope that between this year \r\nand next — before the General Assembly holds its new \r\nsession in 2015 — we will have arrived at a regulatory \r\nframework to restructure sovereign debts. The point \r\nis to engage in an exercise in active and constructive \r\nmultilateralism so that no other country will have to \r\nexperience what Argentina — a country that has the \r\nability and willingness to pay its debts despite the \r\nharassment of these vulture funds — has been through.\r\nThese vulture funds also threaten and hold the \r\neconomy of our country hostage by provoking rumours, \r\nslander and libel from the personal to the economic and \r\nfinancial, so that they sometimes act as a destabilizing \r\nfactor in the economy. Those who set bombs are not the \r\nonly terrorists; those who destabilize the economy of a \r\ncountry and create poverty, misery and hunger through \r\nthe sin of speculation are economic terrorists. That is \r\nwhat we want to spell out. That is why we strongly \r\nadvocate the establishment of a multilateral convention \r\nsoon and expeditiously, not just for Argentina, but \r\nfor the rest of the world. We believe that a financial \r\nand economic balance that addresses the social and \r\neconomic disparities among countries and within \r\nsocieties will also be a great antidote to those who \r\nrecruit young people who have no hope in the future \r\nand enrol them in crazy crusades. We must all lament \r\n14-54711 49/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nthat. We can see only the surface of the phenomenon; we \r\nalso have to delve deeply into the causes that mobilize \r\npeople.\r\nWe also talked about my country as a triple leading \r\ncase on terrorism and security. My country is the only \r\ncountry of the Americas other than the United States of \r\nAmerica that was the target of terrorist attacks: one in \r\n1992 when the embassy of Israel was blown up, and the \r\nsecond in 1994 when the headquarters of the Asociación \r\nMutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA) was bombed. This \r\nyear marks the twentieth anniversary of the bombing \r\nof AMIA. I dare say before this Assembly — in the \r\npresence of some of the family members of the victims \r\nwho have always been with us — that the Government \r\nheaded by President Kirchner did the utmost and went \r\nthe greatest lengths to uncover the real culprits, not \r\nonly because it opened all my country’s intelligence \r\nfiles and created a special prosecutor investigation unit, \r\nbut also because, when in 2006 the justice system of \r\nmy country accused Iranian citizens of involvement in \r\nthe bombing of AMIA, I myself was the only President \r\nwho dared to propose asking the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to cooperate with and assist in the investigation.\r\nThat request was made intermittently from 2007 to \r\n2011, until the Islamic Republic of Iran finally agreed \r\nto a bilateral meeting, allowing it to be included in \r\nthe agenda. That meeting led to the signing by both \r\ncountries of a memorandum of understanding on \r\nlegal cooperation that allowed for the Iranian citizens \r\nwho had been accused, and who live in Tehran, to be \r\ndeposed before the judge.\r\nBut what happened when we signed that \r\nmemorandum? It seemed as if all hell had broken \r\nout, both nationally and internationally. The Jewish \r\nassociations that had sought our support for so many \r\nyears and that had come here with us to ask for help \r\nturned against us, and when an agreement was finally \r\nreached on legal cooperation they accused us of \r\ncomplicity with the State of Iran.\r\nThe same thing happened here in the United States. \r\nWhen the vulture funds lobbied before the United \r\nStates Congress, they accused us of collaborating \r\nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran, which at the time \r\nwas known as the Terrorist State of Iran. They even \r\nlobbied on their websites, posting pictures of me on the \r\nInternet with former President Ahmadinejad as if we \r\nwere business partners. Just this week, we learned that \r\nthe iconic Waldorf Astoria hotel, in this city, was the \r\nsetting for a meeting between the Secretary of State of \r\nthis country and his Iranian counterpart.\r\nWe are not criticizing them. Quite the contrary, \r\nanything that represents dialogue and understanding \r\nseems very good to us. But we wish to ask those who \r\nhave been accusing Iran of being a terrorist State — and \r\nI am not speaking here of the last century, but of last \r\nyear — what they would say today about the members \r\nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), \r\nmany of whom not so long ago were called freedom \r\nfighters when they were fighting in Syria against the \r\nGovernment of Bashar Al-Assad. And this is where \r\nI believe we have another problem with respect to \r\nsecurity and terrorism. The major Powers too often and \r\ntoo easily seesaw from the concept of friend to enemy, \r\nand terrorist to non-terrorist. We need to agree once and \r\nfor all not to use international politics or geopolitical \r\npositions to determine positions of power. I say that as \r\na militant opponent of international terrorism.\r\nBy the way, just to add a touch of color, ISIS has \r\napparently issued a threat against me that is under legal \r\ninvestigation in my country. The threat apparently has \r\ntwo justifications: first, because of my close relationship \r\nwith His Holiness Pope Francis, and secondly, because \r\nI recognize the need for two States, Israel and Palestine. \r\nWhile I am at it, let me reiterate my call on the Assembly \r\nto recognize Palestine once and for all as a State with \r\nfull membership in this body. We have to begin to undo \r\nsome of the Gordian knots — because there is not just \r\none Gordian knot but several — regarding the situation \r\nin the Middle East, which involves recognizing the \r\nState of Palestine, Israel’s right to live securely within \r\nits borders, and Palestine’s right not to be subjected to \r\nthe kind of disproportionate use of force that led to the \r\ndeaths of hundreds of women and children, which we \r\ncondemn just as we also condemn those who attack \r\nIsrael with missiles.\r\nIn a time of economic vultures and hawks of war, \r\nwe need more doves of peace to build a safer world. We \r\nneed more respect for international law and more equal \r\ntreatment of those seated in this Hall. Just this morning, \r\nI overheard one leader refer to the use of force to attack \r\nthe territorial integrity of a country.\r\nHere too, the Republic of Argentina is a leading \r\ncase. For more than 100 years, we have had a claim \r\nagainst the United Kingdom on a matter of sovereignty. \r\nWe once again ask the Assembly to call on the United \r\nKingdom to sit down with Argentina to discuss the \r\n50/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nmatter of the sovereignty of the Malvinas. No one \r\ncares and there is not a single veto from the Security \r\nCouncil, because Argentina is not a member of the \r\nSecurity Council and is not even among the countries \r\nthat decide what happens in the world. So long as \r\nthat continues, and so long as the votes of the five \r\npermanent members of the Security Council are worth \r\nmore than the votes of Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, \r\nEgypt, Uganda, Argentina, Bahrain or the United Arab \r\nEmirates, nothing will be resolved. We will just have \r\nthe same speeches we hear every year without arriving \r\nat a resolution.\r\nThe Assembly must fight to take back the \r\npowers it delegated to the Council, since —almost \r\nparadoxically — the Assembly has to ask the Council \r\nfor permission on its decisions or on whether to admit \r\na member. We need to reassert that the Assembly is a \r\nsovereign body of the United Nations, and that each of \r\nus is worth one vote in a true global democracy. Not \r\neverything will be resolved when that global democracy \r\nis respected to the letter, but I do believe it will mark \r\nthe beginning of a solution. I am neither a pessimist \r\nnor an optimist; I consider myself to be a realist. In any \r\nevent, the child of pessimism and optimism is always \r\noptimism, but with realism. Optimism without realism \r\nis either ingenuity or cynicism. I do not wish to appear \r\ningenuous or cynical before this audience.\r\nI want to convey what we really think in my country. \r\nWe have long demanded reform of the Security Council \r\nand of the International Monetary Fund. In 2003, \r\nreform the International Monetary Fund seemed almost \r\ninevitable; today, hardly anyone remembers the idea of \r\nreforming the International Monetary Fund, because \r\nit no longer plays a central role in decisions. Even the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund itself and both its current \r\nhead and former leaders, including Anne Krueger, are \r\nalso calling for reforms with respect to the restructuring \r\nof sovereign debts. So long as there is no international \r\ntreaty approved by this Assembly, no matter how many \r\nclauses are imposed by the restructuring, there will \r\nalways be a Judge Griesa somewhere in the world who \r\nsays that they are meaningless, and who will end up \r\napplying usurious taxes to bleed some poor country to \r\ndeath. That is what is happening, because it seems to \r\nme that they are trying to overturn the restructuring of \r\nsovereign debt for which the Argentine people worked \r\nso hard.\r\nBefore coming here I was in Rome, meeting with \r\na fellow countryman who today occupies a strong, \r\nexemplary religious and moral leadership. I would like \r\nto offer a message of peace and of peacebuilding. If \r\nwe truly wish to fight terrorism, then let us work for \r\npeace. We cannot fight the terrorists by beating the \r\ndrums of war. Quite the contrary, that is exactly what \r\nthey want — a symmetrical reaction so that the wheel \r\nagain begins to turn and a price is paid in blood.\r\nThat is why I think it is important for us to think \r\ndeeply about those issues. Above all, I want to bring \r\nto the table the certainty that if the United Nations \r\nrecovers its leadership, if the Assembly resumes its \r\nmandate, when too many countries fail to comply with \r\ninternational law, even though they require others to do \r\nso, then I am certain that we will have made a major \r\ncontribution to peacebuilding and the fight against \r\nterrorism from which no one would have been left out. \r\nBut we have to leave to our children a much better \r\nworld than the one we have today.\r\nFinally, I wish to recall that a year ago the problems \r\nwere different. A year ago, we were discussing other \r\nproblems, other threats to security. Times have \r\nchanged. The wrongdoers of yesterday do not seem so \r\nbad today. Those who should have been invaded and \r\ncrushed a year ago, today seem to be cooperating to \r\nfight the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). \r\nFirst, it was Al-Qaida, and, I wonder, where did \r\nAl-Qaida and the Taliban spring from? Where do they \r\nget their weapons and resources? My country does not \r\nproduce weapons. Who sells arms to those groups? \r\nThen there was the Arab Spring, which ended up by \r\nbeing not so much a spring as a fall and even a winter. \r\nThose involved went from being freedom-fighters to \r\nbeing persecuted or imprisoned. Now there is ISIS, a \r\nnew terrorist organization that carries out beheadings \r\non television on a carefully set stage. What is causing \r\nall this, I wonder? Where is this coming from? I have \r\nbecome really distrustful of everything after seeing \r\nwhat is happening in the world today — real-life scenes \r\nthat make fictional series look trivial.\r\nIt is therefore worth asking ourselves why it is that \r\nwe are facing ever-greater problems — problems that \r\ncaused the Pope to comment that there is practically a \r\nthird world war. That is true. It is a world war but not \r\nalong the lines of the more conventional wars of the \r\ntwentieth century. There are hotspots where the only \r\nvictims are civilian populations. That is why, a few \r\nminutes from now in the Security Council, of which \r\nArgentina is a non-permanent member, we wish to raise \r\nsome of those issues. We have no certainties, no absolute \r\n14-54711 51/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\ntruths, but we have many questions. We want to put \r\nthem to those who possess a lot more information than \r\nwe do, far more data and far more extensive networks of \r\ninformation than my country has. Heaven forbid that, \r\nwith all those data, they have a wealth of information \r\nbut can understand little of what is happening. For they \r\nhave to be able to comprehend what is happening if they \r\nare to come up with a definitive solution.\r\nI deeply appreciate once again the political will of \r\nthe 124 countries that supported resolution 68/304. As \r\neveryone knows, there was pressure to keep us from \r\ngetting that number of supporters or having a vote, \r\nbut I think that the exercise of practical, effective and \r\ndemocratic multilateralism that the adoption of the \r\nresolution represents demonstrates that all is not lost. \r\nOn the contrary, it is in the hands of each and every one \r\nof us, each of our countries, to find real and effective \r\nsolutions to the problems the world has today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Argentine Republic for the statement she has just \r\nmade.\r\nMs. Cristina Fernández, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoǧan, President \r\nof the Republic of Turkey\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Turkey.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Erdoǧan (spoke in Turkish; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I greet \r\nthe Assembly respectfully, and I hope that its sixty-\r\nninth session will provide favourable results for all \r\ncountries, peoples and humankind. I would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as the President \r\nof the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to thank \r\nMr. John William Ashe for his work as President at the \r\nsixty-eighth session.\r\nThe sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly \r\nis being held on the hundredth anniversary of the \r\nFirst World War, which broke out in 1914. We sadly \r\nsee that lands affected by the First World War are still \r\ndeprived of stability, peace and prosperity even after \r\na century. A wide area — ranging from Iraq to Syria, \r\nfrom Palestine to Yemen, from Libya to Afghanistan \r\nand to Ukraine — is witnessing scenes that leave deep \r\nscars on the conscience of humankind. People still \r\ndie from hunger and communicable diseases in the \r\ntwenty-first century. Children and women are brutally \r\nmurdered in wars. The poor countries struggle with \r\nhunger, malnutrition, communicable diseases and lack \r\nof education, while the rich countries of the world \r\nenjoy prosperity. Climate change poses a major threat \r\nto the future of our world and that of our children. That \r\nsituation, which is a stain on human dignity, directly \r\nconcerns all of humankind and therefore, of course, the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nLet me again, at this sixty-ninth session, stress \r\nthat no one is innocent in a world in which children are \r\nkilled, no one is safe, and no one can enjoy peace and \r\nprosperity. In the past year alone, 6.3 million children \r\nunder five years of age lost their lives worldwide. As \r\na result of the war in Syria, 17,000 children have died, \r\n375,000 have been injured, and 19,000 have lost at least \r\none body part.\r\nThis year 490 children were killed and 3,000 \r\nwere injured as direct targets of the most modern \r\nand murderous weapons used against the Gaza Strip \r\nin Palestine. As they played on a beach, ran around \r\nin a park, took refuge in a mosque or school, or were \r\ncomforted in their mothers’ laps, they were mercilessly \r\nkilled in front of cameras and before the eyes of the \r\nworld. We also see that those attempting to draw the \r\nworld’s attention to the deaths of women, children and \r\nthe disabled in Palestine are being variously labelled by \r\nothers. Those objecting to the murders in Iraq and Syria \r\nand the murder of democracy in Egypt are again being \r\nsubjected to certain unfair and groundless accusations \r\nand almost immediately accused of supporting \r\nterrorism.\r\nThe global conscience is aware that those who \r\nare ruthlessly criticizing some countries for lack of \r\nfreedom of the press are ignoring the 16 journalists \r\nkilled in Palestine and the pressure put on members of \r\nthe media. I will speak very clearly. Those who stand \r\nby and remain unresponsive to the killing of children, \r\n52/53 14-54711\r\nA/69/PV.6 24/09/2014\r\nthe vicious murder of women and the overthrow with \r\nweapons and tanks of Governments that have come \r\nto power through the will of the people are openly \r\nparticipating in those crimes against humanity.\r\nEven more significant, the modern world’s double \r\nstandard leads to substantial and serious distrust \r\namong many people. That feeling of distrust affects \r\nthe United Nations — where we are today — and other \r\ninternational organizations and threatens the sense of \r\njustice, while filling millions of people with despair. \r\nThat distrust plays a principal role in fuelling the growth \r\nof international terrorism today. The double standard \r\nwith regard to the oppressed and the indifference to the \r\nkilling of children help to foment terrorism around the \r\nworld. Those who lose hope in the United Nations and \r\nother international organizations are desperate and are \r\nhelpless to resist the clutches of terrorists.\r\nThe problems in Iraq have wrought havoc among \r\nthe Iraqi people. More recently, the difficulties have \r\nspread beyond Iraq’s borders. Unfortunately, Iraq has \r\nnow become a haven for terrorist organizations. The \r\ncurrent crisis in Iraq directly affects the countries in the \r\nregion, particularly Turkey. Given the newly established \r\nGovernment in Iraq, it is our hope that Iraq will make \r\na fresh start. Turkey will stand by the Iraqi people in \r\ntheir search for peace and stability. Likewise, the Syrian \r\ncrisis is spilling over the borders of that country. The \r\nunresolved issue of half a century — Palestine — is \r\nalready a root cause of many problems in the region.\r\nImplementing a two-State solution, lifting the \r\nblockade against Gaza and establishing an independent, \r\nviable State of Palestine alongside Israel is a political, \r\nhuman and moral necessity. Many have spoken about \r\na two-State solution from this rostrum. However, \r\nspeaking about it is not sufficient. It is high time to \r\nact. It is no longer appropriate simply to talk about the \r\nissue — we must advance beyond that. Thousands of \r\npeople are dying while we talk instead of acting. I think, \r\nat this point, it is a sad indication of the limits of our \r\nsense of responsibility here at the United Nations. We \r\nmust therefore move forward. We must address these \r\nproblems at the United Nations without any further \r\ndelay in order to prevent more deaths of innocent people \r\nand arrive at a solution.\r\nLet me also say that the world is larger than the five \r\npermanent members of the Security Council. The fact \r\nthat they have rendered the United Nations ineffective, \r\ndespite the situation in the world, must not be accepted \r\nby the global conscience. Otherwise, decisions taken \r\nat the United Nations will depend on a single country. \r\nThat is, if one country disagrees, then a decision will not \r\nbe taken or implemented. The United Nations failed to \r\nfind a solution as more than 2,000 innocent people were \r\nkilled within only two months in Palestine. In Syria, \r\nthe United Nations failed to find effective solutions as \r\nmore than 200,000 people were killed and more than \r\n9 million people were displaced in the past four years.\r\nI find it strange that we focus on issues selectively. \r\nIf 2,000 people are killed by chemical weapons, then \r\nwe focus on chemical weapons, and we consider the \r\nkilling of 2,000 people by chemical weapons to be a \r\ncrime. But what about the killing of 200,000 people by \r\nconventional weapons — is that not a crime? I cannot \r\nunderstand such an approach or such a mentality. Let us \r\nclarify our thinking. Let it be understood that the use \r\nof any kind of weapon leading to the deaths of people \r\nis a crime, whether by chemical or conventional means.\r\nThe elected President in Egypt was overthrown \r\nby a coup. Thousands of people wanted to defend \r\ntheir electoral choice and were killed. Yet, the United \r\nNations and democratic countries have done nothing \r\nbut stand by while those events unfolded and the person \r\nwho conducted the coup was legitimized. If we wish \r\nto speak meaningfully of democracy, then we should \r\nrespect the choice of the people at the ballot box. If, on \r\nthe other hand, we intend to defend people who come \r\nto power via a coup, then I must call into question the \r\nwhole existence of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations is also unable to take an \r\neffective stance in the face of uncontrolled events, \r\nsuch as terrorism and migration in Iraq. This \r\nsilence, desperation and unresponsiveness can no \r\nlonger continue. We need more efficient and speedy \r\ndecision-making mechanisms if we are to be able to \r\naddress global and regional problems. Furthermore, \r\nthe United Nations should act more courageously in \r\nstanding up for the right side of the issues.\r\nLet me point out another problem. We do not \r\napprove of any kind of terrorism that is supposedly \r\ncarried out in the name of religion, and we believe that \r\nsuch acts are hugely disrespectful to all religions. We \r\nstrongly condemn tying Islam, which means peace, to \r\nterrorism. It is highly offensive that Islam and terror \r\nare spoken of together. Similarly, those who call their \r\ninhuman acts Islamic are offending the religion of \r\nIslam, every other religion, and humankind generally.\r\n14-54711 53/53\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.6\r\nTurkey has been trying very hard to build peace \r\nand prosperity in the region. We do not interfere in the \r\ninternal affairs of any country; we respect and support \r\nthe territorial integrity of every country in the region. \r\nRegarding the question of Palestine and Israel, we have \r\nbeen working to try to achieve a two-State solution \r\nbased on peace and mutual respect. Our sensitivity to \r\nthis issue is based on the principle that the right to live \r\nof every human being is sacred.\r\nWe have approached the problems in our region \r\non humanitarian and moral grounds alone, heedless \r\nof race, religion, sect or interests. Our country is \r\nsheltering 1.5 million people who have had to leave \r\nSyria, and mostly from our own resources. Let me \r\nrepeat, 1.5 million refugees are in my country. As the \r\nhost country, we are providing them with food, medicine \r\nand education. As for support from the rest of the world, \r\nthere has not been much, unfortunately. So far we have \r\nspent more than $3.5 billion on the Syrian refugees in \r\nour country. Of the roughly 4 million Syrian refugees \r\nin the world, 1.5 million are in Turkey, with the rest \r\nin Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and other countries. \r\nBy contrast, I would like to ask what the strong and \r\nrich countries of Europe are doing. So far they have \r\nsheltered only 130,000 Syrian refugees — 130,00 in all \r\nof Europe, while in Turkey alone we have 1.5 million, \r\nplus the 2.5 million in the other countries I just \r\nmentioned.\r\nThe crisis in Syria has become a regional and \r\nglobal issue, so much so that it is impossible to remain \r\nindifferent to it, whether for political or humanitarian \r\nreasons. On top of this, we have treated 102 injured \r\ncivilians from Gaza in our hospitals. Turkey has also \r\ntaken in 30,000 Yazidis f leeing Iraq, and, just before \r\nI came to New York, we opened our borders to Kurds \r\nf leeing Syria. It was Turkey who gave them humanitarian \r\naid. In the past five days alone, the number of Syrian \r\nrefugees entering our country exceeded 150,000.\r\nFive hundred years ago, we opened our doors to \r\nJews who had been expelled from Europe. We have \r\nalways protected the rights of Christians in Europe, and \r\ntoday we are still opening our arms to those in need, \r\nregardless of their religion, race or sect. I am proud \r\nto say that Turkey allocates 2.1 per cent of its national \r\nincome to humanitarian aid, and as such has become \r\none of the most generous countries in the world. In \r\naddition, thanks to the experience we have gained \r\nthroughout history, we have always maintained our \r\nobjectivity regarding terrorism, sectarian conflicts and \r\nother crises, and we have always based our approach on \r\nthe defence and protection of people’s rights.\r\nI would like to point out here that Turkey is not \r\na country that supports or condones terrorism. We \r\nhave fought terrorism, because we suffered from it \r\nfor 30 years, and are still suffering from it. Turkey \r\nis also strongly against every kind of anti-Semitism, \r\nIslamophobia and racism. I have said myself that \r\nanti-Semitism is a crime against humanity, and I may \r\nbe one of the few political leaders who has so clearly \r\nexpressed this to the world. Similarly, the whole world \r\nshould accept that Islamophobia is also a crime against \r\nhumanity.\r\nTurkey would like to see a solution to the problem in \r\nCyprus. We would like to see an end to the occupation \r\nof territories in Azerbaijan. We have always voiced our \r\nstrong support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. \r\nWe stand ready to support regional and global peace \r\nat all costs, and we will continue to be a unique friend \r\nto our friends. We will always stand firm against \r\nterrorists, oppressors and killers, especially the killers \r\nof children. We will fight for democracy and prosperity \r\nwith all our heart and soul. We are always ready to \r\njoin forces with other countries within the framework \r\nof those ideals and on this common path, and that, of \r\ncourse, is the kind of cooperation that humankind is \r\nseeking today.\r\nIn that context, I should also say that we look to the \r\nGeneral Assembly to support Turkey in its candidacy \r\nfor a non-permanent seat on the Security Council, and \r\nwe thank the countries that are backing us. To that end, \r\nI hope that the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly will \r\nbegin the work of wiping away the tears, blood, poverty \r\nand injustice staining the face of the Earth. I wish the \r\nAssembly and its President, Mr. Kutesa, every success, \r\nand I would like to convey my country’s sincerest \r\ngreetings to all the nations represented here.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Turkey \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.35 p.m.\r\n"
