That is not a matter of a simple \r\npolitical statement. It is a commitment shared with \r\nthe entire world to change our visions of development \r\nto a more comprehensive, holistic vision. What we \r\npropose to the world is living well, in harmony with \r\nMother Earth, and the construction of a culture of life, \r\ncomplementarity, solidarity and peace.\r\nRespect for Mother Earth has been lost. Today \r\nshe is being marketed and manipulated, causing grave \r\ndanger to life. Now as at no other time, the premise \r\nthat man believes himself to be the lord and master of \r\nnature is more true than ever. Humankind, encouraged \r\nby capitalism, has turned everything into a market, \r\nincluding genetic manipulation and the destruction of \r\nhuman beings.\r\nHuman and natural life and their happiness \r\nshould be the reason why any vision, tool or focus for \r\ndevelopment exists. No vision of development makes \r\nsense if it does not respect or strengthen life. Economic \r\ngrowth does not in itself lead to the realization of \r\nsocial rights and good living. The horizon of equality \r\ncalls for the distribution of wealth and the economic \r\nand political empowerment of the poor, the excluded \r\nand the marginalized. It calls for strengthening \r\ncommunities and building societies with solidarity, not \r\nexclusive societies based on the accumulation of wealth \r\nand governed by money, covetousness and the avarice \r\nof the market.\r\nTogether with the Group of 77 and China, I must \r\nstate the fundamental importance of recovering the \r\nsovereignty of our countries and peoples over our natural \r\nresources. It is only by recovering control of our natural \r\nresources that we will be able to garner greater benefits \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.7\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n7th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 24 September 2014, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nfor our peoples, in particular to eliminate poverty and \r\nto invest in economic diversification, industrialization \r\nand social programmes.\r\nEach country has the right to decide on its priorities \r\nand strategies for development, but it is important that \r\nthose strategies strengthen the environmental functions \r\nand the ecosystems of Mother Earth in the framework \r\nof complementarity and mutual support between \r\nproductive systems, communities and nature. It is vital \r\nto strike a balance between the rights of Mother Earth, \r\nthe right to development, the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples and social, economic and cultural rights, as \r\nwell as the right of the poor to emerge from poverty. \r\nComplementarity and mutual support, not commercial \r\nincentives, are instruments to preserve Mother Earth. \r\nOn this point we differ from the followers of the so-\r\ncalled green economy.\r\nAn important issue to be promoted in the framework \r\nof the post-2015 agenda is the human right to water and \r\nthe right of Mother Earth to enjoy water for regenerating \r\nand reproducing life. Three billion people today live in \r\nareas or regions where the demand for water exceeds \r\nits availability, and that reality will worsen as years \r\npass. By 2030 the demand for water will have increased \r\nby 30 per cent. In 2050, four billion people will suffer \r\nfrom critical scarcity of water in the context of climate \r\nchange.\r\nIn Bolivia, in accordance with human right to \r\nwater and with our Constitution, and thanks to the \r\nnational programme known as My Water, we have \r\nalready reached the Millennium Goals. We did so three \r\nyears ahead of schedule. Declaring the human right to \r\nwater means it cannot be privatized. Water is life, and \r\nit cannot be an object of profit or commercialization. \r\nLikewise, to resolve serious social inequalities, basic \r\nservices such as water, electricity, telecommunications \r\nand basic sanitation, as well as education and health, \r\nmust be a human right.\r\nWe have a pending agenda to eradicate poverty \r\nand hunger, but for that we must also fight the pitiless, \r\ninhumane forces of capital and the market, the \r\nomnipresent power of banks and usurers who profit \r\nfrom consumerism and hunger. The so-called vulture \r\nfunds are an expression of that. They are agents of \r\nfinancial rapine who live off speculation, stealing from \r\ndeveloping countries with impunity, taking the bread \r\nfrom the poor, extorting and defrauding with the help \r\nof the legal systems of capitalism. They caused the \r\nfinancial crisis and profited from it.\r\nWe must profoundly change the exclusionary \r\nstructures of financial institutions, such as the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. \r\nThat should be part of the transformation of the world \r\nfinancial architecture. Those organizations cannot be \r\ngoverned only by developed countries, which, through \r\nclever financial strategies, blackmail and oppress \r\ndeveloping countries, especially the poorest. That is \r\nwhat we call eradicating financial colonialism.\r\nIn the world there still exists an offensive, abusive \r\nreality — the 1.3 billion poor people and more than \r\n800 million who are chronically malnourished — as \r\nwell as the gaps between the rich and the poor. That \r\nis due to an unequal distribution of income, but also \r\nto an unequal and discriminatory access to wealth, to \r\nthe means and factors to live well and to enjoy basic \r\nservices. The increase in the number of hungry people \r\nin the world is due, without doubt, to the financial \r\ncrisis. If not for that, there would now be 413 million \r\nfewer hungry people in the world. But the eradication \r\nof hunger and poverty is unthinkable without changing \r\nthe international financial architecture.\r\nThe violence of war feeds the darkest interests, \r\nsuch as the geopolitical control of the great Powers and \r\ncorporations that promote conflicts in order to ensure \r\ntheir imperial or neocolonial interests. Today, it is the \r\neconomic interests of capital that promote neocolonial \r\nwars. With the expense required for war campaigns, \r\nhumankind could overcome many of its problems, \r\nincluding the Ebola virus, tuberculosis, AIDS or \r\ndengue.\r\nWe have again witnessed the cruelty and barbarity \r\nof the genocidal actions of the Government of Israel \r\nagainst the Palestinian civilian population. We have \r\ntherefore denounced Israel for violating international \r\nhumanitarian law and universal human rights. We \r\ndemand an investigation of the crimes committed by \r\nIsrael in the Gaza Strip. The Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia, like other Latin American countries, agrees on \r\nthe profound need to reiterate the legitimacy of United \r\nNations resolutions demanding the end of the occupation \r\nof the Palestinian territories and the construction of an \r\nindependent State within the borders existing prior to \r\n4 June 1967. That is why we again reiterate the need \r\nto recognize Palestine as a full-f ledged Member of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs Chair of the Group of 77 and China, I cannot \r\nfail to mention the important commemoration of the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the creation of the Group of 77, \r\n14-54765 3/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nheld on 14 and 15 June in the city of Santa Cruz de \r\nla Sierra, Bolivia. The Summit of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the Group of 77 and China adopted a \r\ndeclaration entitled “For a new world order for living \r\nwell” (see A/68/948), which confirms the principles of \r\nunity, complementarity and solidarity and the building \r\nof a new world order that establishes a more just and \r\ndemocratic system for the benefit of our peoples.\r\nWe commend the Bolivarian Alliance for the \r\nPeoples of Our America-Peoples’ Trade Agreement \r\n(ALBA-TCP) on completing 10 years of tireless work \r\ntowards the integration of peoples. That work goes \r\nbeyond commercial profit and focuses on promoting the \r\nvalues of cooperation, solidarity and complementarity. \r\nIn its 10 years, ALBA-TCP has become a major player \r\nin Latin America and the world.\r\nSince March 2011, 150,000 people have died in \r\nSyria and 3 million people have f led as refugees to \r\nneighbouring countries. Bolivia agrees that the future \r\nand destiny of Syria must be determined by the Syrian \r\npeople themselves in the full exercise of democracy, in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nBolivia condemns and rejects the interference by \r\nthe United States of America in Iraq that triggered the \r\ncurrent crisis in the country. The war unleashed in 2003 \r\nagainst Iraq destabilized the entire region. It was said \r\nthat Iraq possessed large quantities of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. That argument remains one of the biggest \r\nlies ever told in the history of imperialism. On the basis \r\nof that lie, peaceful coexistence among social, ethnic \r\nand religious groups has been destroyed. The situation \r\nhas given rise to a terrorist group called the Islamic \r\nState that is imposing a new war that threatens the entire \r\nregion. Bolivia rejects the extreme violence with which \r\nthat terrorist group has acted against civil society and \r\nwholeheartedly affirms that nothing justifies fratricidal \r\nviolence.\r\nThe invasion of Iraq, together with other historical \r\nevents, has taught us a lesson that wherever the United \r\nStates of America intervenes, it leaves destruction, \r\nhatred, misery and death in its wake, but it also leaves \r\nwealth in the hands of those who profit from the wars: \r\nthe transnational corporations of the arms industry and \r\nthe oil industry. We must make use of the culture of \r\npeace to eradicate extremist fanaticism, but also the \r\nimperial warmongering promoted by the United States, \r\nwhich, faced with war, threatens more war. The United \r\nNations was created to build and promote peace, not to \r\njustify wars and invasions.\r\nUsing war against war is not the same as peace. \r\nThat is a perverse formula — the formula for death and \r\nendless confrontation. We must resolve the structural \r\ncauses of war: marginalization, poverty, lack of \r\nopportunities, cultural and political exclusion, social \r\ndiscrimination, inequality, usurpation and territorial \r\ndispossession, ruthless capitalism and dictatorship of \r\nthe interests of transnational corporations. Every year \r\nhere we hear Mr. Obama deliver a discourse on war, \r\narrogance and threats against the peoples of the world. \r\nIt is also a discourse of extremist fanaticism.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nimposed by the Government of the United States \r\nagainst Cuba is the main tool of United States policy \r\nin its eagerness to destroy the revolution and restore its \r\nhegemony over Cuban territory. The blockade against \r\nCuba is the most unjust, severe and prolonged system of \r\nunilateral sanctions that has ever been applied against \r\nany country. The blockade qualifies an act of genocide. \r\nThat colonial blockade must be ended immediately.\r\nWe want to affirm before this Assembly the historic \r\nright of the Bolivian people to their access to the sea — a \r\nright that was trampled by a brutal invasion promoted \r\nby colonial business interests. The colonial imposition, \r\nthe absence of genuine participatory democracy and the \r\ninterests of foreign companies were interposed between \r\nthe Bolivian and Chilean peoples, fraternal peoples who \r\nwere led to a war favouring the transnationals. Because \r\nmy country firmly believes in and promotes peace and \r\nharmony in our relations with all of our neighbours, we \r\nturned to the International Court of Justice in search \r\nof dialogue to resolve, peacefully and in good faith, \r\na prolonged dispute over our sovereign access to the \r\nPacific Ocean.\r\nOur demand does not seek to alter the international \r\norder of the limits and boundaries or to threaten \r\ninternational treaties, as the the Government of Chile \r\nwould have people believe. On the contrary, Bolivia has \r\ninvoked international law and its principles to resolve, \r\nmethodically and in good faith, the issue of its sovereign \r\naccess to the Pacific Ocean. An effective and peaceful \r\nsolution regarding Bolivia’s sovereign access to the \r\nsea would be in the interests of our peoples, the new \r\ngenerations, the region and the whole world. I therefore \r\ncall on all countries of the United Nations system at \r\nthis sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly to join \r\nus, not only Bolivia, but our neighbour Chile, in this \r\nchallenge to peace, justice and rule of law.\r\nWe must eradicate violence and war and denounce \r\nthe imperialist warmongering of the world Powers that \r\n4/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\narrogantly believe they embody the ideals of freedom. \r\nThe imperial Powers use their communication media \r\nto manipulate the wills and the emotions of the people. \r\nThey lie and deceive with impunity. They divide and \r\npit nations and communities against one another to \r\npromote wars, control strategic resources and put them \r\nat the service of their foreign capitals.\r\nThis is the century of peace, but peace with \r\nsovereignty, with freedom for peoples and not with a \r\nfree market. This is the century of agreements on liberty, \r\nlife and peace and not for agreements on free trade \r\nin life. There will be no harmony if the arrogance of \r\nempires and their renewed colonialism harass, oppress \r\nand kill human beings, cultures and the peoples of the \r\nworld. The empire of finance, the empire of markets, \r\nthe empire of the arms industry must all fall to give way \r\nto the wisdom of life and life in peace and harmony.\r\nTo summarize with the greatest respect and \r\nadmiration for the Assembly, I would like to say that if \r\nwe want to put an end to poverty, if we want to defend \r\nlife and Mother Earth, our only path is to put an end \r\nto the capitalist system and imperious thinking for the \r\nwell-being of humanity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Constitutional President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of \r\nthe Dominican Republic, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Medina Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): It \r\nis an honour to participate in the sixty-ninth session \r\nof the General Assembly of the United Nations by \r\nrepresenting the people and the Government of the \r\nDominican Republic. I wish to express my sincere \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \r\nPresident at the current session. I wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the honour \r\nbestowed on our country by inviting us to participate \r\nin the Education First initiative. As I hope that he \r\nwas able to note in his recent visit to our country, the \r\npriority that education is being given in the Dominican \r\nRepublic is perhaps the best indicator of the new hopes \r\nspringing up in our country. It is true that news of hope \r\nis especially valuable these days when it is not very \r\nabundant.\r\nGenerally speaking, the times we live in \r\nraise major challenges for the mission of the \r\nOrganization — preserving peace, encouraging \r\ndevelopment, making education and health the \r\nentitlement of all inhabitants of the Earth. As we are \r\nall aware, about six years ago, a crisis that began in \r\nthe financial sector of developed countries quickly \r\nspread to all productive sectors and has affected the \r\nentire planet. The consequences of the economic shock \r\ncontinue to be felt and were translated into tens of \r\nmillions of unemployed, millions of evictions and deep \r\ncuts in social benefits in our countries.\r\nThe welfare State, the instrument which produced \r\nsome of the greatest advances in development and \r\nsecurity in history, was jeopardized. Today, we live \r\nthe paradox of seeing how that ideal of sustainable \r\ngrowth and social justice becomes more fragile in \r\nthe countries of origin, while it is being reborn in \r\nemerging countries. While developed countries adopt \r\npolicies of austerity and structural adjustments, which \r\nare concepts sadly familiar to Latin Americans, we \r\nsee how social programmes proliferate in different \r\ncorners of the planet, lifting millions out of poverty and \r\nmitigating inequality.\r\nIn the Dominican Republic, we still have a long \r\nroad ahead of us, but we are taking firm steps in the \r\nfight against poverty and inequality. We are a small \r\ncountry but we do not lack ambition. We have made \r\nthe commitment to our people, our citizens, to put \r\nthem at the centre of our public policy. And we have \r\nset ourselves the goal to become a developed and \r\nprosperous country, where equal opportunities will be, \r\nnot an ideal, but an everyday reality.\r\nTo achieve this, we have established a major \r\ndomestic compact, which will be our top priority as a \r\nnation: namely, education. That is why we have doubled \r\nthe current budget for public education and allocated \r\n14-54765 5/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nto it 4 per cent of our gross domestic product. This \r\nwill enable us to carry out the largest expansion of \r\nschool infrastructure ever in our history and ensure \r\nthat all girls and boys, without exception, will have \r\naccess to quality public education. I am also proud to \r\ntell the Assembly that at the end of this year, thanks to \r\nthe efforts of thousands of volunteers, we will be in a \r\nposition to declare our country free of illiteracy.\r\nIn health, that second pillar essential to the welfare \r\nState, we are also making significant progress. We \r\nhave eliminated the co-payment for all public hospitals. \r\nEvery year, we add 450,000 participants to the \r\nsubsidized health insurance system.\r\nWe are also giving priority to supporting small \r\nagricultural producers. We have been visiting rural \r\ncommunities every week for two years now, listening \r\nto people and seeking ways of helping them, such as \r\nby providing credits, training and infrastructure. The \r\nresult of this, which is being monitored by the United \r\nNations Development Programme, is a rebirth of the \r\nDominican countryside, including improving its ability \r\nto feed the country and creating employment in rural \r\ncommunities. Thanks to that and other measures, over \r\nthe past 18 months in the Dominican Republic overall \r\npoverty has been reduced by 6 per cent and poverty \r\nin rural areas by 9 per cent. In other words, in 18 \r\nmonths we have lifted more than half a million people \r\nout of poverty. We will continue to work tirelessly, \r\nimplementing policies that put the economy at the \r\nservice of the people and taking measures to combat \r\npoverty and inequality in a sustainable manner, and we \r\nwill continue to create the basis of what one day will be \r\na full welfare State in the Dominican Republic.\r\nIt is an honour for us to be one of the signatory \r\nnations of the founding Charter of the United \r\nNations, which, as everyone knows, assigned to the \r\nOrganization its purpose of saving future generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war. We should recognize that 2014 \r\nis presenting major challenges to that noble purpose. In \r\ndifferent latitudes of the world, there have been violent \r\nconflicts between communities, peoples or States. The \r\ncontexts of those conflicts are varied, but one thing \r\nremains constant — the extent to which past grievances \r\nshape our identities today, and how dangerous it is to \r\nallow oneself to be submerged by them. We watch in \r\nperplexity and indignation the virulence with which \r\nthese violent conflicts are waged in different parts of \r\nthe world.\r\nThe Middle East is once again the scene of the \r\nbloodiest sectarianism, which we condemn from this \r\nrostrum in all its manifestations. In the history of all \r\nnations or communities, without exception, there is \r\na long history of disagreements, misunderstandings \r\nand quarrels that, at times, can be used to stir up the \r\nworst passions. They can be manipulated by individuals \r\nseeking to consolidate power or inflamed by extremist \r\ngroups that feel that they have nothing to lose. There will \r\nalways be someone who keeps old disputes alive. There \r\nwill always be someone who does not mind sacrificing \r\nthe true interests of the people at the time because of \r\nthe wrongs of the past recorded in the history books.\r\nHowever, there are plenty of examples to the \r\ncontrary. Throughout the world, there are people and \r\ncountries that have managed to leave their past behind \r\nin order to focus on building the future that they want \r\nfor their children and new generations. Whether it is \r\nbuilding bridges between countries once in conflict, as \r\nthe European Union did, or among communities that \r\ndecided to share the same nation, as in the case of South \r\nAfrica. Hope can and must find its way.\r\nI would also like, if I may, to bring a note of \r\noptimism from our Caribbean region. In the past year, \r\nwe started a dialogue process with neighbouring Haiti \r\nthat can rightly be regarded as historic. Our situation is \r\nof course unique but not to the degree that it cannot be \r\nechoed in other parts of the world. As members perhaps \r\nknow, since the birth of our two Republics, there has \r\nbeen a long history of misunderstanding and disputes, \r\nwhich led to each of our countries having a distorted \r\npicture of the other.\r\nIt is true that in our past there were a couple of \r\npainful chapters, which are part of our identity. \r\nHowever, if we limit our identity to those few chapters, \r\nit will be impoverished. Our history is very rich. It has \r\nhundreds of chapters. In many of them, we can find the \r\ninspiration to guide us towards a better future and a \r\nmore complete, richer and more human identity because \r\nthat is clearly an excellent basis for understanding. In \r\nboth countries, there are millions of people who want \r\nbetter development, education, health care, security \r\nand jobs and more opportunities. Those are concrete \r\ndemands that require specific measures. The truth is \r\nthat, by responding to them and reaching agreements \r\nin each of those areas, in a few months we were able to \r\nachieve the progress that we had not made  in decades.\r\nLittle by little, we are moving forward. We are \r\ndiscovering that old wounds do not impede advancing \r\non that path, but that they heal as we move forward. \r\nOur peoples demanded that we exercise the necessary \r\n6/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\ncourage to take the first step. We will continue to take \r\nsteps until we achieve our goal of two free, sovereign \r\nand independent nations that, on the basis of their \r\nsovereignty, cooperate for the benefit of their respective \r\npeoples.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity from this rostrum \r\nat the General Assembly to make an appeal. As I have \r\nsaid, a new era in Dominican-Haitian relations has \r\nbegun. In that new phase, we would like to enjoy the \r\nsupport of the international community. One of our \r\nmain actions to strengthen Dominican sovereignty and \r\nto ensure the rights of people living in our territory \r\nis to provide them all the relevant documentation. As \r\nmembers know, many of those people are Haitian. In \r\norder to regularize their status in the territory of the \r\nDominican Republic, they must first have identity \r\npapers from their country of origin, which many of them \r\nunfortunately lack. Haiti is making an effort to reach \r\nthose Haitians and to provide them with documents \r\nthat recognize them as its nationals. However, Haiti’s \r\ntechnical and economic resources are limited. In the \r\npast, a number of international organizations and \r\ncountries have expressed their concern about the \r\nfate of Haitian migrants. We share that concern for \r\nhumanitarian reasons and because it affects us as the \r\nmain host country.\r\nI would therefore note that now is an excellent \r\ntime to move from words to actions. With specific and \r\nrelatively simple actions, the international community \r\ncan have a major and lasting impact on the lives of those \r\npeople. I appeal for help for Haiti. May the international \r\ncommunity help Haiti to document its people in its \r\nterritory and in ours, since documentation is the first \r\nessential step for the enjoyment of a wide-ranging body \r\nof rights. Let us not allow a few technical shortcomings \r\nto be an obstacle to such a hopeful and necessary process \r\nwith as much potential as that new stage of cooperation \r\nbetween the Dominican Republic and Haiti.\r\nThere are times when our best aspirations seem \r\nfragile. There are times when cynical people point out, \r\nunder I do not know what law of the economy or in \r\nhistory, that we are bound to repeat the mistakes of \r\nthe past. They say that poverty cannot be overcome, \r\nthat the gap of inequality will always grow and that \r\npast grievances will be reborn in each new generation. \r\nHowever, we know that none of that is true. We know \r\nwhere to look to find the path of hope. We have only to \r\nlook at those who are closest, that is, our own people, \r\ntheir basic daily needs and the hopes that motivate them \r\nto continue the struggle. If we look carefully, we see \r\nthat the economy is not a prison but can be a tool for \r\nimproving the lives of people. We find that the people \r\nare free. They are free to know which parts of their past \r\nthey wish to use as a guide to their future and which \r\nthey wish to leave aside.\r\nWe will find a way to work together, as we have \r\ndone with the neighbours with whom we share an island, \r\nor as we found yesterday, during the climate summit, \r\nwith the other countries with which we share the planet. \r\nThe citizens that we represent, increasingly better \r\ninformed, demand that we live up to our responsibility \r\nand our declared commitment: to preserve peace, to \r\npromote development and to make education and health \r\ncare the right of all inhabitants of the planet.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Dominican Republic \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President and Commander-in-Chief of \r\nthe Defence Forces of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Kenyatta: It is a great pleasure to address \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. As the \r\ncurrent Chairman of the East African Community, I am \r\nparticularly pleased to see The Honourable Sam Kutesa \r\npreside over the General Assembly. I assure you, \r\nMr. President, of the full support of my Government \r\nduring your presidency.\r\nI would like to begin by lending my voice to all of \r\nthose who have called for urgent and sustained attention \r\n14-54765 7/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nto the devastating Ebola crisis in Liberia, Sierra Leone \r\nand Guinea. Beyond the tragedy of the thousands who \r\nhave lost lives and loved ones and the many more \r\nliving with that threat, livelihoods and businesses have \r\ncollapsed and aspirations for shared prosperity continue \r\nto shrink day by day. Kenya stands in solidarity with \r\nthe countries affected by this devastating virus.\r\nEarlier this month the Kenyan people gave \r\n$1 million to the effort to bring the crisis under control, \r\nand we stand ready to do more. Last week, ministers \r\nof health from the East Africa region converged in \r\nNairobi and agreed on measures to safeguard our \r\npopulations and ensure that the virus does not spread \r\nin our region. The suspension of international f lights \r\ninto Monrovia and other affected capitals, including \r\nby Kenya Airways, followed a stark warning from the \r\nWorld Health Organization (WHO). Those measures, \r\namong others, have isolated the affected countries and \r\nfurther hurt the people and economies of the region.\r\nWith regard to Kenya, our intention was not to \r\ndo harm, but the warning from the WHO left us, as \r\na regional hub, with few options. We stand ready \r\nto resume Kenya Airways f lights once appropriate \r\nmeasures are put in place. Kenya believes that nothing \r\nin the immediate future requires more attention and \r\ndetermined response from the international community \r\nthan the effort to stop and contain that devastating \r\nvirus. I therefore welcome the establishment by the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations Mission for \r\nEbola Emergency Response, which I am sure will guide \r\na collective global response.\r\nThe Ebola crisis underlines the imperative to build \r\nstrong States that can withstand crisis and respond to \r\nemergencies. State weakness in many African countries \r\ncomes from a history of development paradigms and \r\npractices that weakened the State. We must commit \r\nto building strong, resilient and accountable States \r\nthat can effectively respond to shocks, adversities and \r\nemergencies in the future.\r\nYou, Sir, are presiding over a session of the General \r\nAssembly of historic significance to humankind. The \r\nsixty-ninth session will oversee the development and \r\nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda. This \r\neffort will build on the work of the Open Working Group \r\non Sustainable Development Goals, which developed \r\nthose goals. Kenya is indeed proud to have been at the \r\nforefront of driving the Open Working Group process.\r\nThe new world development agenda must address \r\nitself to the entire cross-section of social, economic \r\nand environmental challenges that face the world in \r\nthe twenty-first century. Issues of sustained economic \r\ndevelopment, equality among nations, climate change, \r\nindustrialization, biodiversity loss and environmental \r\nprotection must now go hand in glove with the traditional \r\nchallenges of poverty, disease, hunger and inequality \r\nwithin nations. The new agenda must therefore be \r\nuniversal and comprehensive and responsive to all \r\nnations equally in order to be transformative in its \r\nimpact.\r\nWe in Kenya recognize, however, that a number \r\nof obstacles stand in the way of achieving the new \r\ndevelopment agenda. The most immediate of these are \r\nterrorism and violent extremism. In Kenya, we stand \r\nat a critical moment. As we deepen our democracy, we \r\nfind our nation thrust onto the front line of a regional \r\nand global war against terror. We have become acutely \r\naware that the interplay between democratization, on \r\nthe one hand, and effective counter-terrorism, on the \r\nother, presents severe challenges to our security and \r\nour governance institutions. Increasingly, terrorist \r\nactors are exploiting the expanded democratic space, \r\nsometimes feeding into and even influencing local \r\npolitics. Unless we can provide an effective buffer to \r\nfight back against that tendency, Kenya and indeed other \r\ncountries will find it difficult to entrench democracy \r\nand the post-2015 development agenda.\r\nBesides the immediate threat of terrorism, the state \r\nof economic and social well-being is also affected by \r\nthe lack of sustainable peace and security in many \r\nof our countries. From the Central African Republic \r\nto Mali, Libya and even as far afield as the Middle \r\nEast and Europe, we see new conflicts and crises that \r\ncould derail or delay development. In Kenya, we are \r\nparticularly concerned by the perennial fragility that \r\nhas come to characterize the greater Horn of Africa.\r\nIn Somalia, Kenya continues to sacrifice lives \r\nand resources in an effort to bring peace to our \r\nneighbour. We do this trusting that the international \r\ncommunity will stay the course in Somalia. This \r\ninvolves consolidating peace and investing in stable, \r\nresponsive national institutions that guarantee public \r\nsafety, promote democracy and civil liberties, as well \r\nas development and peace in the country and region.\r\nAs we meet here, South Sudan also remains \r\nin turmoil. Kenya and other countries of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \r\nhave invested considerable effort in ending that tragedy \r\nand sparing the people of South Sudan further suffering. \r\n8/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nRegrettably, however, progress has been slow. We \r\ncannot let that young nation and its people down. At \r\nthis session of the Assembly, I make a special plea for \r\nSouth Sudan, for no nation has, over the years, suffered \r\nas much neglect from the international community.\r\nSimilarly, no country today remains as desperately \r\nin need of rapid and transformative economic and \r\nsocial development as South Sudan. We cannot allow \r\na return to political chaos, economic collapse or social \r\ndesperation. I implore the leaders of that young nation \r\nto demonstrate determined and enlightened leadership \r\nand to make peace without further delay. Such action \r\nwill save the people of the nation enormous suffering \r\nand offer hope of a better future. I thank the Security \r\nCouncil for its continued cooperation with IGAD in the \r\nsearch for peace in South Sudan. It is this concert of \r\naction that will help to bring about lasting peace, which \r\nin turn will form the basis for a transformative post-\r\n2015 development agenda for South Sudan and all of its \r\nneighbours.\r\nOn the continent of Africa the development \r\nmodel of the past 50 years has run its course. That \r\noutmoded model was defined by negative trade \r\nrelations, paternalistic global governance regimes \r\nand overreliance on official development assistance. \r\nMoreover, it was driven by external prescriptions for \r\ndevelopment that were heavy on political instruction, \r\nbut light on economic and social transformation.\r\nWe now know better. We know that our social \r\nand economic transformation shall come first from \r\nwithin our nations, our region and our continent, and \r\nonly secondly from the complement of external ideas \r\nand resources. Equally important, those external \r\ncontributions must recognize the primacy of our \r\naspirations and ideas. They must value and safeguard, \r\nrather than simply exploit and consume, our domestic \r\nresources and the product of our people’s labour. For \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda to be transformative, \r\ntherefore, it must first embrace the primacy of \r\ndeveloping countries whose people seek sustained \r\ndevelopment most. Anything less will be a recipe for \r\nfailure.\r\nWe cannot speak of development or of \r\ntransformation when millions of the world’s people \r\nare mired in and are broken by unrelenting poverty, \r\ndisease and hunger. The business of ridding the world \r\nof those plagues, touched upon but not fully embraced \r\nby the Millennium Development Goals, must be the \r\nfirst of the aspirations of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. Equally important, it must be fully financed \r\nand accelerated, if we are to lay the groundwork for a \r\ntransformative agenda for the next generation. I cannot \r\nemphasize that point enough. The scourge and shame of \r\ndebilitating poverty, preventable diseases and chronic \r\nhunger must be erased from our global civilization. In \r\nreaching the sustainable development goals we have set \r\nourselves, within a time frame of 15 years, we must not \r\nfail.\r\nThis year, at the United Nations, Kenya is proud \r\nto have presided over the Conference of States Parties \r\nto the Convention on the Rights for Persons with \r\nDisabilities. Kenya also presided over the United \r\nNations Forum on Forests and co-chaired the Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nKenya is currently presiding over the UNICEF Board, \r\nas it seeks to provide global leadership for issues of \r\nconcern to the world’s children and their well-being.\r\nKenya is a member in good standing of the \r\ninternational community and it intends to continue to \r\nshoulder its global and regional responsibilities. Kenya \r\nis especially proud of the scores of Kenyans who work \r\nfor the United Nations here in New York, but also further \r\nafield in peacemaking, peacekeeping, peacebuilding \r\nand in many United Nations organizations in various \r\nUnited Nations stations around the world, including \r\nNairobi. I salute all those Kenyans — every single one \r\nof them — for their dedication and commitment. We in \r\nKenya believe that no nation is too poor or too rich, too \r\nbig or too small to play its rightful role in making the \r\nworld a better place for all.\r\nAt the national level, Kenya grounds her \r\ntransformative agenda on a strategic vision — our Vision \r\n2030. Importantly, in 2010 we adopted a new democratic \r\nConstitution, which expanded and guaranteed a \r\nwider range of rights for our people and defined \r\nnew institutions for the advancement of those rights. \r\nDrawing on that, we have re-engineered our system \r\nof governance, making it more democratic, inclusive, \r\ndevolved and responsive. We have also significantly \r\nexpanded participation in political and development \r\ndecision-making.\r\nIn four short years, we have begun to witness the \r\nfruits of those foundational changes. Aware of the \r\nimperative to carry along all our people in development, \r\nmy Government launched targeted interventions for the \r\nmost vulnerable in society. Those include a number \r\nof financial initiatives and training programmes \r\nfor women and youth. We have also prioritized the \r\n14-54765 9/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nadvancement of children’s rights and welfare through \r\ninitiatives that reduce mortality and morbidity. Chief \r\namong them are universal immunization coverage, the \r\npromotion of breast-feeding for the first six months \r\nof a child’s life, the provision of fortified foods and \r\ninsecticide-treated mosquito nets, as well as free care \r\nfor mothers and children in all government hospitals.\r\nIn that respect, I wish to commend the first Lady \r\nof Kenya, Ms. Margaret Kenyatta, for successfully \r\nlaunching the Beyond Zero Campaign that is tapping \r\ninto private sector financing to bolster the management \r\nof chronic preventable diseases, including HIV/AIDS, \r\nand to improve maternal and child health throughout \r\nthe country.\r\nKenya is today on track to achieve universal \r\nprimary education. Based on that, we have expanded \r\nour vision to include universal secondary education. We \r\nare seeking to build a more inclusive society, and strive \r\nto leave no one behind. It is for that reason that my \r\nGovernment has implemented a social protection cash \r\ntransfer programme to orphans and vulnerable children, \r\npersons with severe disabilities and our elderly citizens. \r\nThe programme targets 450,000 households throughout \r\nKenya. Impact evaluations indicate that the programme \r\nhas reduced poverty, improved family health and raised \r\nschool enrolment.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, Kenya is a leading \r\ntourist destination. We are also endowed with a number \r\nof rare species, some endangered, which we hold in \r\ntrust for humankind. My Government attaches great \r\nvalue to conservation. We continue to raise awareness \r\nof the need to step up the fight against poaching and \r\nillicit wildlife trafficking. We have enacted laws to \r\nhelp fight the scourge, and continue to work with other \r\ncountries and organizations to enhance the protection \r\nof our fauna and f lora. Similarly, Kenya remains at the \r\nheart of international efforts to mitigate and adapt to \r\nchallenges relating to climate change. We continue to \r\nwork towards achieving 10-per cent forest cover; we are \r\nwell above global targets for renewable energy use, and \r\nfully support all measures agreed upon at the recent \r\nUnited Nations Environmental Assembly in Nairobi.\r\nRecognizing that our prosperity is linked to that \r\nof our neighbours, Kenya is engaged in a range of \r\nprogrammes and activities to hasten eastern African \r\nintegration. We have eased the movement of goods \r\nand services across our borders. More importantly, our \r\npeople can travel, work and settle across east Africa. \r\nWe have also grown our trade volumes and are looking \r\nto closer integration across a range of other sectors.\r\nThose are a few highlights of my Government’s \r\ntransformative agenda. We are committed to \r\nsafeguarding and expanding those initiatives by creating \r\nan enabling and secure environment. In light of that, \r\nmy Government continues to invest heavily to combat \r\nextremists and terrorists. The global effort needs to be \r\nreinforced because, as we know, the intent of terrorists \r\nis to destroy free, secure and democratic nations and \r\npeople. As long as international terrorism exploits our \r\nopen, multicultural and multi-religious society and \r\ngravely harms our social fabric, our progress towards \r\nachieving the goals of a transformative agenda will no \r\ndoubt be slowed.\r\nKenya believes in a better, happier and more \r\nprosperous future for all. It is my hope that the confluence \r\nof forces that have come together to continually make \r\nour development efforts unnecessarily difficult will \r\nbe persuaded with urgency, to reassess their motives \r\nand hopefully re-engage within the global community \r\nand with our country and region in a more positive, \r\nconstructive and humane manner; recognizing that, in \r\nthe end, no one people, nor one country, not even any \r\none continent, can inhabit the world peaceably alone \r\nin isolation from the rest of the globe. We are in this \r\nworld together to succeed together, to win together and \r\nto build a better future for all everywhere, together.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President and Commander-in-Chief \r\nof the Defence Forces of the Republic of Kenya for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President \r\n10/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Solís Rivera (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, former \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Uganda, on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly. We wish \r\nhim the greatest success in carrying out his duties.\r\nWhirlwinds of oppression and violence, anxiety, \r\ndesperation and the systematic violation of human rights \r\naffect many corners of the world. We are witnessing an \r\nupsurge in violence and armed confrontations and an \r\nincrease in atrocious crimes and extremism with an ever \r\nincreasing number of displaced persons, humanitarian \r\ncrises and deplorable acts that remain unpunished.\r\nWe are also concerned in particular about the \r\nuniversal dimension of the crisis caused by the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). That reality requires \r\nthe coordinated and forceful multilateral action of \r\nthe international community in accordance with the \r\nrelevant bodies of the Organization. We have seen \r\nthe images and heard the screams of pain and distress \r\nrising out of Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Afghanistan, \r\nMali, Libya, the Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia and the \r\nCentral African Republic. The cries can also be heard \r\nin Central America, where thousands of children and \r\nyoung people cross borders alone heading towards the \r\nUnited States of America, f leeing violence and a lack \r\nof opportunities in pursuit of dreams that can turn into \r\nnightmares. The Assembly can never put aside the \r\nfuture of those children because, in many ways, the \r\ngirls and boys of Central America who travel alone are \r\nalso our sons and daughters.\r\nCosta Ricans are not indifferent to the terror \r\nof armed conflicts, less still to the suffering of the \r\nmillions of victims of its most abject manifestations. As \r\na nation, we have always stood with our sister nations \r\nin our efforts to bring an end to war and to establish \r\npeace. The conflicts that torment us often emerge from \r\nthe fragile situations of States and their institutions: \r\nextreme poverty, corruption and impunity. In all of \r\nthem, serious human rights violations have occurred. \r\nNone of those conflicts broke out without prior \r\nwarning. Ther were clear warning signs. In some cases, \r\nthe threat was identified but no action was taken, as in \r\nSyria. In other cases, the danger was not acknowledged \r\nin time, as in South Sudan. However, in all such cases, \r\nthe victims are those who are most vulnerable and most \r\nneed our help but who cannot make their voice heard. \r\nThey are the reason that we are here today.\r\nFaced with the loss of human lives, we have reason \r\nto ask ourselves if we have kept the solemn promise \r\nthat accompanied the founding of the United Nations \r\n69 years ago. Do all Members of the Organization refrain \r\nfrom resorting to the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of other \r\nStates? In some cases, that is so, in others not, but the \r\nfailure to act is unacceptable. When States disregard \r\nthat promise, the system of the United Nations is called \r\nto action. Otherwise, it becomes weak. It loses its \r\nessence. It loses its spirit.\r\nThe greatest challenge facing the international \r\ncommunity, the United Nations and the Security \r\nCouncil — the challenge I wish to talk about \r\ntoday — is maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity as essential common goods. If we want peace, \r\nwe must prepare for peace. Maintaining international \r\npeace and security begins with a culture of peace. As \r\nan unarmed democracy and home to the University for \r\nPeace, the Inter-American Institute of Human Rights \r\nand the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Costa \r\nRica believes that the culture of peace and education for \r\npeace must be an absolute priority. We are convinced \r\nthat peace, like war, is not the product of a human or an \r\nhistoric destiny but is borne of the very freedom of the \r\nhuman being.\r\nMaintaining international peace and security is not \r\nrestricted to dealing with conflicts. The Organization \r\nwas founded on the ashes of two world wars precisely \r\nin order to prevent them. Prevention begins at the \r\nState level, with the strengthening of democracy and \r\nits institutions, good governance and a social welfare \r\nState founded of the rule of law as a basic prerequisite \r\nfor the promotion of development and fair and inclusive \r\nsocieties. Prevention is also founded on a solid and \r\nfunctioning multilateral system. Costa Rica values \r\nand encourages the preventive diplomatic measures \r\nprovided for in Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which include mediation, good offices and \r\nearly warning.\r\nMr. Aslov, (Tajikistan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nAs part of the Group of Friends of Mediation, \r\nI would like to highlight Costa Rica’s leadership in \r\nnegotiating General Assembly resolution 68/303, \r\nwhich seeks to acknowledge the key role that regional \r\nand subregional organizations play in mediating and \r\nmanaging conflicts. To date, that is the first General \r\nAssembly resolution on mediation to recognize that \r\n14-54765 11/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nrole. Its inclusion is therefore a true achievement of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMaintaining international peace and security \r\nrequires all States to resolve our disputes peacefully in \r\nline with the Charter of the United Nations and in strict \r\naccordance with international law and agreements. Costa \r\nRica firmly believes in and implements all aspects of \r\ninternational law. We therefore underscore in particular \r\nthe role of the International Court of Justice and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Peace cannot take root \r\nwhere there is impunity. When war crimes, genocide \r\nand crimes against humanity have been committed, \r\nthose responsible must be investigated and put on trial, \r\nincluding by the International Criminal Court when the \r\nnational jurisdiction proves insufficient.\r\nOur country opposes the weakening of the Rome \r\nStatute and any proposed reform that could promote \r\ntolerance for impunity. Once again, we remind the \r\nSecurity Council of its authority and responsibility \r\nto refer to the International Criminal Court cases that \r\noccur in non-States parties. That is the only approach \r\nwe recognize. Our only weapon is and will always be \r\ninternational law.\r\nMaintaining international peace and security \r\nalso necessitates strengthening the single global \r\nOrganization charged with defending them. The \r\nSecurity Council must progress from a reaction \r\nmentality towards one of action, and reaffirm its moral \r\nand political commitment to all humankind. It must be \r\nvigilant, strategic and proactive. It must be democratic, \r\nefficient, transparent and inclusive. My country has \r\nobjected to the use of the veto to obstruct measures \r\naimed at preventing or resolving conflict. Costa Ricans \r\nare amazed by the way some permanent Council \r\nmembers have invoked the principal of sovereignty to \r\nblock intervention by the Council at a moment when it \r\nshould have acted to prevent rivers from turning red \r\nwith the blood of innocent victims.\r\nWe reiterate our call on the permanent members \r\nto refrain from using the veto, especially in situations \r\nof genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and \r\nmass human rights violations. We therefore welcome \r\nthe French proposal for a code of conduct addressing \r\nthe use of the veto. In that spirit, Costa Rica supports \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Rights Up Front Action \r\nPlan so as to place human rights at the centre of the \r\nprevention activities of the United Nations. Given our \r\nserious and unshakeable commitment to human rights, \r\nI respectfully ask the Assembly to back Costa Rica’s \r\nre-election to the Human Rights Council in October.\r\nOur poet Jorge Debravo said that we Costa Ricans\r\n“have the obligation to fight for a better future for \r\nman, for a wonderful future. It is not an option for \r\nus to remain silent. It is not an option for us to be \r\nobservers or simple witnesses to the struggles of \r\nour nations. In a time like this, remaining neutral is \r\nto betray humanity’s future”.\r\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we condemn \r\nthe indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israel by Hamas \r\nand its use of human shields, just as we condemn the use \r\nof disproportionate force in military operations carried \r\nout by the Israel Defense Forces. We demand respect \r\nfor the ceasefire and the negotiation of a permanent \r\nsolution based on two States living side by side in peace \r\nand harmony.\r\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we reject the \r\ntransfer of conventional weapons to existing conflict \r\nzones. As one of the world leaders in the negotiations \r\nthat led to the Arms Trade Treaty — an idea originally \r\nproposed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former-\r\nPresident Óscar Arias Sánchez — we urge States to \r\nreconsider their laws and policies regulating the transfer \r\nand availability of arms and munitions, with a view \r\nto preventing access by those who would use them in \r\nviolating human rights and international humanitarian \r\nlaw. To trade in death is to become an accomplice to \r\natrocities. In that context, it would be appropriate to \r\nask the Assembly: What is the ethical — not legal or \r\nregulatory — difference between trafficking arms \r\nthat kill young people in less-developed countries and \r\ntrafficking in drugs that lead to the same result in the \r\nplanet’s richest countries?\r\nBecause silence is not an option for us, Costa \r\nRica rejects the use of explosive weapons in densely \r\npopulated areas of Syria, Gaza and eastern Ukraine. \r\nCosta Rica urgently calls on Member States to develop \r\nstricter rules and commitments to prohibit and restrict \r\ntheir use, not only because they violate international \r\nhumanitarian law, but also because taking action on that \r\nissue, here and now, is critical to reducing incentives to \r\nnon-combatants to take up arms and join the extremists.\r\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we also \r\ncondemn the use of cluster munitions in Syria, South \r\nSudan and eastern Ukraine. As the host of the Fifth \r\nMeeting of States Parties to the Convention on Cluster \r\n12/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nMunitions, which took place in San Jose from 2 to \r\n5 September, my country will continue to reject the \r\nmanufacture, use and trade of those weapons. We \r\nrejoice that our beloved Central America has become \r\nthe first region of the world to be declared free of cluster \r\nmunitions, and reiterate our commitment to continuing \r\nto promote the Convention’s universalization.\r\nBecause silence is not an option for us, we reiterate \r\nour rejection of nuclear weapons. No State should \r\ndevelop or possess nuclear weapons. Maintaining and \r\nupdating nuclear weapons requires immense economic \r\nand human resources that are necessary for responding \r\nto the key challenges of our time, such as achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals. Costa Rica is ready to negotiate a \r\nnew, legally binding instrument on nuclear disarmament \r\nand calls on States to honour their commitments in that \r\nregard.\r\nThere can be no peace without sustainable \r\ndevelopment. There can be no peace in the world so \r\nlong as there is poverty. There can be no peace in the \r\npresence of extreme wealth disparity. There can be no \r\npeace while we destroy humankind’s habitat. There \r\ncan be no peace while large sectors of humankind \r\nlack guaranteed access to drinking water. There can \r\nbe no peace so long as we fail to understand that all \r\nof humankind and Planet Earth’s biodiversity can and \r\nmust thrive and live together. There can be no peace \r\nwhile we fail to guarantee all human rights — civil, \r\ncultural, economic, political and social — and in \r\nparticular the right to development.\r\nBecause we yearn for peace, we call on the \r\nnations of the world to join us in defining the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. In just one year’s time, \r\nthe General Assembly will be tasked with adopting \r\nthe international framework for achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The challenge we will face is colossal; \r\nwe must therefore humbly acknowledge that, despite \r\nprogress, the implementation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals has been, at best, insufficient.\r\nI am convinced that the new sustainable development \r\nagenda must be a tool primed for action, with precise \r\nobjectives, clear targets and indicators that will allow us \r\nto measure and monitor its success. In addition, it must \r\nresult from a broad international consensus, including \r\nopen and transparent negotiation processes that involve \r\nnot only the Member States, but also other international \r\nactors and civil society organizations whose experience \r\nwill significantly enrich the final agreement.\r\nWe are facing the most serious threat in our \r\nhistory — the very survival of our species. Actions \r\ntaken to confront it must not be timid. On the contrary, \r\nevery public policy, national and international alike, \r\nmust take climate change into account as a determining \r\nfactor. Costa Rica celebrates the vision of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in convening the Climate Summit at the \r\nopening of this session. Now is the time to demonstrate \r\nour political commitment to achieving a legally binding \r\ninstrument on climate change by 2015. In addition, we \r\ndemand robust action on the part of those countries that \r\ncontribute most to global warming. Their production \r\nand consumption methods must be completely revised \r\nas their impact on the planet’s most impoverished \r\npeople — the ones most affected by climate change — is \r\nundeniable. If humankind is to survive, we must reverse \r\nthe current trend.\r\nThree years ago, 33 countries came together to \r\nestablish the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States (CELAC). Its agenda is underpinned \r\nby full respect for the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nIts objective is to build diverse, equitable, fair and \r\negalitarian societies, where eradicating poverty and \r\nhunger are given priority status. I salute the nations, \r\nmembers of this community.\r\nIn an international context of increasing military \r\ntension and armed conflict, and with the realization \r\nthat a region’s prosperity and stability can contribute \r\nto international peace and security, CELAC member \r\nStates have declared Latin America and the Caribbean \r\na zone of peace. As President Pro Tempore of CELAC, \r\nCosta Rica reiterates its commitment to preventive \r\ndiplomacy and the peaceful resolution of disputes, \r\nwith the aim of forever eradicating both the use and the \r\nthreat of force from our region.\r\nCosta Rica trusts that the United Nations will \r\nmaintain international peace and security in order to \r\npromote sustainable development and ensure genuine \r\nrespect for all human rights. At a time when we must \r\ncontrol the reflexive use of coercive measures as a \r\nfirst course of action, when anxiety and despair are \r\nunsettling many, it is essential to re-establish hope. \r\nWhen faced with fear, we must have confidence. When \r\nfaced with conflict, we must turn to peace. When faced \r\nwith rejection and prejudice on the part of others, we \r\nmust offer a caring and fraternal embrace. When faced \r\nwith death, we must think of life.\r\nWith faith in dialogue and consultation, I have \r\ncome to the General Assembly to ask that we declare \r\n14-54765 13/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\npeace — that we conscientiously and decisively work \r\ntogether towards a culture and education for peace; \r\ntowards strengthening of the social State based on \r\nthe rule of law, as well as its institutions and our \r\neconomies; towards conflict prevention and resolution \r\nof international controversies by peaceful means; \r\ntowards a renewed role for the Security Council; \r\ntowards an end to and a reversal of climate change; and \r\ntowards sustainable development from which not one \r\nperson in the world is excluded.\r\nI have come to tell the Assembly that silence is \r\nnot an option for us. We must raise our voices when \r\nconfronted with actions and situations that go against \r\nthe universal principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. I have come to inspire us to work \r\ntogether on new paradigms for sustainable development, \r\nhuman security and peace for the whole world.\r\nThe Costa Rican poet Julieta Dobles Yzaguirre \r\nwondered: “Will the Earth in the new millennium/ \r\nbecome that common home?” I would like to respond to \r\nthe poet with her own words: “No one is saved alone./ \r\nPerhaps in sharing words and actions/ peace will finally \r\nbreak out.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Costa Rica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President \r\nof Mongolia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, \r\nPresident of Mongolia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Tsakhia: At the outset, Sir, may I join \r\nothers in extending our heartfelt congratulations to \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa on his unanimous election as President \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Mr. Kutesa \r\ncan count on my delegation’s full support in the \r\ndischarge of his enormous responsibilities in steering \r\nour work in the months ahead.\r\nThe world is faced with multiple crises — violent \r\nconflicts in various parts of the world, terrorist activities \r\nby extremist groups, unprecedented epidemics and \r\nnatural calamities. At this time of turmoil, we, as \r\na family of nations, must rally around this world \r\nOrganization as a centre of multilateralism, upholding \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the universal \r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nWe need peace and development. We need to do \r\nour utmost to implement the right of peoples to peace \r\nas emphasized by the Declaration on the Right of \r\nPeoples to Peace, adopted 30 years ago at the initiative \r\nof Mongolia. We have consistently supported the \r\njoint efforts of the international community against \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Mongolia \r\nis a party to the majority of international counter-\r\nterrorism instruments. The seemingly unthinkable \r\natrocities committed by the terrorist group called the \r\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant pose alarming \r\nthreats to regional peace and security. The international \r\ncommunity must take resolute action to defeat these \r\nthreats comprehensively and in compliance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nMongolia commends the Secretary-General’s \r\nleadership in rallying international support and \r\nestablishing the United Nations Mission for Ebola \r\nEmergency Response to ensure a rapid, effective and \r\ncoherent response to the Ebola crisis. We support the \r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions to \r\nthat effect.\r\nThe situation in Ukraine should be resolved only \r\nthrough political dialogue, without the use of force. The \r\ncurrent ceasefire needs to be made more sustainable; all \r\nefforts towards finding a solution, including the Putin \r\nplan outlined in Ulaanbaatar earlier this month, as well \r\nas the Minsk protocol of 5 September and its follow-up \r\nmemorandum, should be taken into account.\r\nMr. Sirodjidin Aslov (Tajikistan), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nJust 25 years ago, Mongolia chose its development \r\npath, deciding to embrace the rule of law, democratic \r\ngovernance, a market economy and an open society. \r\nAlthough we are among the countries known as \r\nthe third wave of democratization, the transition to \r\ndemocracy was in many respects unique in Mongolia. \r\n14/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nWe made a simultaneous transition to democracy and a \r\nmarket economy. We made that transition peacefully. In \r\n1990, democratic parliamentary elections were not only \r\nthe first of their kind in the region, but they were fully \r\nfree and fair. To ensure inclusive growth and citizens’ \r\nparticipation, a national policy on decentralization \r\nthrough direct democracy was introduced. As a \r\nresult, citizens are now able to directly participate in \r\nidentifying development priorities and allocations and \r\nmonitoring local budgets.\r\nTo identify a long-term development pathway \r\nand regain the confidence of investors, a number \r\nof multi-stakeholder events have been held in \r\nMongolia — the Economic Forum, the Business \r\nSummit and Discover Mongolia. In addition, new \r\nlaws, particularly on investment, investment funding \r\nand petroleum, and budget transparency, have been \r\nadopted.\r\nAt the international level, Mongolia served as \r\nthe Chair of the Fifth International Conference of \r\nNew or Restored Democracies and the Community of \r\nDemocracies. We currently chair the Freedom Online \r\nCoalition. It is the first time that an Asian country \r\nleads the Coalition. We support the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s decision that Internet freedom is a basic \r\nhuman right. As a staunch advocate of democracy \r\nand freedom, Mongolia will use its opportunity as \r\nchair of the Coalition to promote, both nationally and \r\ninternationally, an Internet that is free and secure for \r\nall.\r\nTo support emerging democracies, Mongolia has set \r\nup an international cooperation fund. We have nothing \r\nto preach, but we have experience and lessons learned. \r\nWe therefore shared with Kyrgyzstan our experience in \r\nparliamentary democracy and legal reform, and we held \r\ntraining sessions for Afghan diplomats and Myanmar \r\njournalists.\r\nMongolia highly commends the Secretary-General’s \r\nleadership in galvanizing and catalysing global action \r\non climate change. Climate change is not a challenge \r\nfor the future; it is a matter of urgent Permanent \r\nRepresentativeiority today. Yesterday’s United Nations \r\nClimate Change Summit 2014 offered world leaders a \r\nunique opportunity to voice their commitments to cut \r\nthe emission gap and to pledge their commitment to the \r\ntwo-degree scenario in the lead-up to the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate, to be held \r\nin Paris next year.\r\nBut that pledge will remain a mere ambition if it \r\nis not backed up by bold action and strong political \r\nwill. We are running out of time, but we cannot run \r\nout of planet Earth. The time to act is now. Moreover, \r\nthe Green Climate Fund needs to be made fully \r\noperational. If resources are actually transferred as \r\nan incentive to countries that reduce their emission of \r\ngreenhouse gases, that will have a multiplier effect. No \r\none country is immune to climate change. Even my own \r\ncountry, Mongolia, which has a centuries-old tradition \r\nof living in harmony with nature, is experiencing its \r\ndisproportionate effect. Conscious of that reality, \r\nMongolia has recently adopted a green development \r\npolicy. We expressed our support for the statement on \r\ncarbon pricing, and for the New York Declaration on \r\nForests to combat deforestation.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly has the \r\nimportant task of articulating the post-2015 development \r\nagenda based on the legacy of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). In that regard, we look \r\nforward to a synthesis report by the Secretary-General \r\nPermanent Representativeior to the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations for the sustainable development goals \r\n(SDGs) during this General Assembly session. We \r\nalso welcome the outcome of the Open Working \r\nGroup on SDGs and commend its hard work over the \r\npast 18 months. The United Nations Conference on \r\nSustainable Development underscored the special \r\nchallenges facing the most vulnerable countries, \r\nincluding landlocked developing countries (LLDCs). \r\nHowever, we believe that the outcome document of the \r\nOpen Working Group could have better reflected the \r\nspecial needs of landlocked developing countries. We \r\nhope that the upcoming intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwill redress that situation.\r\nIn the run-up to the 10-year review of the Almaty \r\nProgramme of Action, in June 2014 we hosted a \r\nhigh- level international workshop, “The World \r\nTrade Organization Agreement on Trade Facilitation: \r\nImplications for LLDCs.” We also joined the \r\nIntergovernmental Agreement on Dry Ports in order to \r\nbecome involved in regional connectivity. Facilitation \r\nof transit transportation, infrastructure development \r\nand reduction of trade barriers were among the issues \r\ndiscussed during the recent visits to Mongolia by \r\nPresident Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin. We \r\nagreed to expand our cooperation in those areas. Those \r\nagreements were reiterated at the first ever trilateral \r\nsummit that brought together Mongolia, China and \r\nRussia on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation \r\n14-54765 15/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nSummit in Dushanbe earlier this month. The expansion \r\nof our cooperation with those two neighbours augurs \r\nwell for regional trade and investment and paves the \r\nway for enhanced economic collaboration with our \r\nother neighbours.\r\nMongolia is redoubling its efforts to join the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation, to become a dialogue \r\npartner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\nand to constructively engage in the East Asia Summit. \r\nLast July we also signed an economic partnership \r\nagreement with Japan. Strengthening peace and \r\nstability in North-East Asia is one of our national \r\nsecurity Permanent Representativeiorities. We firmly \r\nbelieve that dialogue and open discussions enhance \r\nconfidence among nations. Following up on the \r\nUlaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security, we \r\nhave successfully hosted a series of fruitful platforms, \r\nincluding a meeting of women parliamentarians, an \r\ninternational research conference and a meeting of \r\nmayors from cities in North-East Asian countries.\r\nStability on the Korean peninsula is crucial for \r\nmaintaining regional peace and security. We support \r\nan early resumption of the Six-Party talks. As a country \r\nwith a declared nuclear-weapon-free status, Mongolia \r\nfirmly believes that the Korean Peninsula must be \r\nnuclear-weapon-free.\r\nIn a time of major geopolitical change, the United \r\nNations system must reflect new economic and political \r\nrealities. We need to accelerate the reform process, \r\nincluding the long-overdue expansion of Security \r\nCouncil membership in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories. The issue of the Council’s \r\nworking method is also important for all small States, \r\nwhich make up a majority in the United Nations.\r\nOut of 193 States Members, 105 belong to the \r\nForum of Small States. Of the 70 States that have never \r\nbeen elected as members of the Security Council, \r\n50 are small States, including my own country, \r\nMongolia. As a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity, Mongolia has put forward its candidacy for \r\na non-permanent seat on the Security Council in the \r\nelections to be held in 2022, and is seeking the valuable \r\nsupport of its fellow members.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my \r\nconfidence that this session of the General Assembly \r\nwill be able to deliver a common development strategy \r\nbeyond 2015, a strategy that will inspire and guide us \r\nto work collectively towards a safer, more equitable and \r\nprosperous future in the years to come.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of Mongolia for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Jonathan: Let me begin, Sir, by \r\nexpressing the best wishes of the Government and the \r\npeople of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on Mr. Kutesa’s \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. His election is a fitting \r\ntribute to his invaluable and inspiring contribution to \r\ninternational diplomacy. I would also like to express \r\nmy warm appreciation to his predecessor, Ambassador \r\nJohn Ashe, for the astute and steadfast manner in which \r\nhe steered the affairs of the sixty-eighth session of the \r\nAssembly. I thank Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon not \r\nonly for his relentless commitment to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations, but especially for his tireless efforts \r\nto address the challenges of world peace and security.\r\nWe are meeting at a time when the world looks with \r\nexpectation towards 2015, which marks the end of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the launch \r\nof their successors, the sustainable development goals \r\n(SDGs). We must ensure, at all levels, that the SDGs \r\nreflect the goals and aspirations of all the regions of the \r\nworld. Indeed, if the SDGs are to drive development and \r\nalso meet the aspirations of developing countries for \r\npoverty elimination and sustainable growth, collective \r\nownership of the emerging process must be our \r\npriority. We in Africa expect that the new SDGs will be \r\npeople-centred. They must promote peace and security, \r\nstructural economic transformation, inclusive growth, \r\nfood security for all, environmental sustainability and \r\nthe shared benefits of science and technology. Indeed, \r\n16/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nthe gains of the MDGs must be incorporated into the \r\nemerging mechanism.\r\nWe applaud the wide-ranging recommendations \r\nof the report of the Intergovernmental Committee \r\nof Experts on Sustainable Development Financing \r\non domestic resource mobilization, international \r\ndevelopment assistance, private sector finance and a \r\nsupportive global enabling environment. My country is \r\nhonoured to have been accorded the privilege, jointly \r\nwith Finland, of leading that work as co-Chair of the \r\nIntergovernmental Committee of Experts, as mandated \r\nby the Heads of State and Government at the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development in \r\nRio. Along with the work of the Open Working Group \r\non sustainable development goals, the report provides \r\na solid basis for intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda. Nigeria is aware of \r\nthe need to create an enabling environment for rapid \r\ndevelopment. We are committed to strengthening \r\ninstitutions and improving governance systems, in \r\norder to ensure an efficient use of resources and the \r\nprocess itself.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe year 2015 also marks the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the establishment of the United Nations. Even \r\nthough the Charter of the United Nations underlines \r\nthe imperative to spare succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war, the world continues to witness the \r\nravages of war and human suffering. Today’s terrorism, \r\nmanifested sometimes in insurgency, is vicious and \r\naimless. Its consequences are agonizing, marked \r\nby a tendency to annihilate victims and completely \r\ndestroy infrastructure and properties. The involvement \r\nof foreign fighters remains a common feature of \r\nterrorist groups, whether Al-Qaida in the Maghreb, \r\nAl-Shabaab in Somalia, Boko Haram in Nigeria or the \r\nnewly emerging Islamic State (IS). The new dimension \r\nintroduced by IS — namely, the goal of conquering \r\nterritory and establishing its destructive ideology — is \r\na major challenge that must be collectively halted before \r\nit becomes the norm. That challenge focuses renewed \r\nattention on the need to review the existing tools for \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nThe violent and criminal activities of Boko \r\nHaram have continued to pose a potent challenge to \r\nthe Government and people of Nigeria. Through a \r\nwave of terror, assassinations, bombings and now \r\nabductions and kidnappings, predominantly in the \r\nnorth-east of the country, Boko Haram is attempting \r\nto truncate development in those areas through murder \r\nand mayhem. In April, our innocent daughters were \r\nabducted from a secondary school in Chibok, in the \r\nnorth-east. That callous and criminal act has attracted \r\nempathy for Nigeria across the globe.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank all \r\nthe countries and organizations that have expressed \r\nsolidarity with us and have continued to support our \r\ndetermined efforts to free our daughters. Although it \r\nhas been over three months since they were abducted, \r\nwe have never relented in our efforts to see them safely \r\nfree. Together with our partners, we are working \r\nassiduously to free our daughters and reunite them \r\nwith their families. To that end, I wish to thank the \r\nGovernment of France for organizing and hosting the \r\nspecial summit on security in Nigeria that was held in \r\nParis in May. I also wish to express my appreciation \r\nto the Governments of Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and \r\nGuinea for their committed efforts in support of the \r\nfight against Boko Haram. The outcome of the French \r\nprocess and the follow-up in London, Washington, D.C., \r\nand Abuja have helped to galvanize regional action and \r\nare already yielding positive results. Let me underline \r\ntoday that we shall not waver until we end this mindless \r\nwar on the innocent and bring all the perpetrators to \r\njustice. We will triumph over terrorism.\r\nThe failure of the Security Council to agree on \r\nunanimous action over pressing challenges to global \r\npeace and security in Syria and Iraq and the conflict in \r\nUkraine, as well as with regard to the renewed aggression \r\nbetween Israel and Palestine, has strengthened the case \r\nfor Security Council reform. Today’s challenges can \r\nbe resolved only by a Security Council whose working \r\nmethods engender transparency, inclusivity and \r\ncommon ownership through equitable representation \r\nof all regions in the decision-making process. It is \r\nimperative that we take advantage of 2015, which also \r\nmarks the fiftieth anniversary of the 1965 reform, to \r\nmake concrete progress on reforming the Security \r\nCouncil. We believe that there needs to be a fast-track \r\nprocess in line with the initiative of Mr. John Ashe, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth \r\nsession, for establishing a working group on reform. \r\nIndeed, the Security Council requires the collective \r\nresolve of all Member States to ensure that 2015 brings \r\ndecisive progress.\r\nEven as Africa, and in particular West Africa, \r\nbattles conflicts and terrorism, with progressive \r\n14-54765 17/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nresults, the region is being devastated by the outbreak \r\nof the deadly Ebola virus. While Nigeria was able to \r\nrespond effectively to control the spread of the disease, \r\nthe situation in Liberia and Sierra Leone requires \r\nsustainable collective global action if it is to be \r\ncontained. Through the concerted efforts of our health-\r\ncare professionals, the World Health Organization and \r\nour international partners, we have been able to contain \r\nthe virus, and we can confidently say that Nigeria today \r\nis Ebola-free.\r\nHowever, we have continued to support efforts \r\nto contain the spread of the disease in Sierra Leone, \r\nLiberia and Guinea. In addition to a direct donation \r\ntotalling $3.5 million, we have provided training and \r\ncapacity-building support to the three countries. It \r\nis pertinent to stress the need for the international \r\ncommunity to properly appreciate the magnitude of \r\nthe Ebola challenge. Indulging in isolationist and \r\ndiscriminatory tendencies, as some countries are doing, \r\nwill only worsen an already critical situation. To prevent \r\nthe disease from becoming a global catastrophe, the \r\nUnited Nations must accord it the maximum priority \r\nit deserves.\r\nCertainly, there has been much discussion on \r\nlimiting ozone layer depletion since the commencement \r\nof negotiations under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change in 1994. However, the \r\nextent of progress in key areas, particularly in limiting \r\nthe contribution of man-made activities to greenhouse \r\ngas emission, has yet to be determined.\r\nNigeria appreciates the indispensable role of the \r\nUnited Nations in its search for solutions to all those \r\nchallenges: terrorism, global peace and security, \r\nthe environment, and forging sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment. We have been and will remain a reliable \r\nand active partner, especially as we collectively work \r\nto resolve the new and emerging threats to global peace \r\nand security. The world must come together and win the \r\nwar against terror.\r\nOn 29 May 1999, Nigeria ended its military rule after \r\nthe inauguration of a democratically elected President. \r\nCome February 2015, the country will conduct its fifth \r\npost-military-rule general election. In keeping with \r\nmy election as President by the people of Nigeria, we \r\nshall conduct elections based on global best practices to \r\nfurther strengthen our democratic institutions.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federal Republic of \r\nNigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Kagame, President of the \r\nRepublic of Rwanda\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Rwanda.\r\nMr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Paul Kagame, President of \r\nthe Republic of Rwanda, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Kagame: I want to start by congratulating \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nWe are living through a period of unprecedented \r\nprogress in human development. The success of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals framework \r\ndemonstrates that international cooperation remains \r\nstrong, though we wish the expected results would \r\ncome faster. Even on climate change, if the public and \r\nprivate sectors work together to increase investment \r\nin scientific research, we can look forward to a future \r\nwhere countries no longer have to choose between \r\ngreen energy and economic growth.\r\nWhile we work on building peace and well-being \r\nin Africa, crises elsewhere in the world have aroused \r\ngrave concern. Efforts to address them seem to have \r\nlittle effect, and in some cases they may even make \r\nthings worse.\r\nTwo critically important public goods have been \r\nconsistently undervalued by the international system in \r\nits approach to conflict resolution and peacebuilding. \r\nThey are physical security and national identity. When \r\nsecurity breaks down, the human costs are enormous. \r\nExtremists and opportunists are empowered. Citizens \r\nlose faith in public institutions, as grievances are \r\nsettled in the street. As a result, sustainable gains in \r\ngood governance cannot be made. It takes time and \r\npatience to build a better political system. There are \r\nno shortcuts. We are dealing with real people who want \r\nchange, but with continuity and safety. They must be \r\nfully included in the process of consensus-building. \r\n18/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nThat is because structures of governance that are not \r\ndeveloped from within will not take root. We should \r\nencourage full ownership and partnership, and the \r\napproach of international institutions and Member \r\nStates should take those realities into account. In \r\ncountries that have known only peace, such arguments \r\nmay sound self-serving. But they are not, because lives \r\nare at stake.\r\nThe second neglected element is national identity. \r\nThat is just as important. To manage the diversity in our \r\nsocieties, politics must be national in scope. Whatever \r\ndifferences we may have, our common citizenship \r\nis a bond that unites us. The negative experiences \r\nof nationalism have created doubt about affirming \r\npatriotism and national identity. However, what we see \r\naround the world today is that national identities are too \r\nweak, not that they are too strong. As a result, ethnicity, \r\nregion and religion become the dominant currency \r\nof politics, and nations are torn apart. International \r\nsystems should encourage efforts by Governments and \r\ncivil society to strengthen national unity.\r\nIn Rwanda, we have focused on building \r\naccountable governance institutions and renewing our \r\ndignity as a nation. As a result, Rwandans today are \r\namong the most optimistic and civic-minded people \r\nin the world. For us, stability is not an abstraction, it \r\nis a reality that abides in the minds and hearts of the \r\npeople and the institutions they build to sustain it. Once \r\nachieved, the horizon expands from poverty reduction \r\nto wealth creation and the attainment of ever higher \r\nmeasures of human development.\r\nTherefore, our task in the international community \r\nis not to manage conflicts, but to help prevent and end \r\nthose conflicts. If we focus on keeping people safe and \r\nbringing them together to solve their problems, we will \r\nbe able to do so.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Rwanda \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Honduras.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Honduras, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Hernández Alvarado (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I am Juan Orlando Hernández. I was born in \r\na humble village called Rio Grande, in the department \r\nof Lempira, a region with very high rates of inequality \r\nand poverty, although that is now changing, as is my \r\nwhole country. I am here in my capacity as President \r\nof Honduras, a country located in the heart of the \r\nAmericas. It is a country small in size, but with a great \r\ndesire to achieve development based on its own identity, \r\nand with a people who struggle daily to advance and \r\nprogress, and who aspire to better living conditions.\r\nIn 2009, our country suffered one of the worst \r\npolitical crises in its history. It led to several hundred \r\nmillion dollars in losses, and most unfortunately, to \r\nthousands of divided families and more poverty. That \r\ncrisis caused more damage than any hurricane or \r\nnatural disaster. However, today we can say that we \r\nhave overcome the political crisis.\r\nHonduras is a country where full democracy is \r\npractised and there is complete freedom to choose its \r\nleaders. In addition to representative democracy, we \r\npractice participatory democracy. Proof of that is the \r\ndialogue that will lead to a compact for Honduras that \r\nwill be the result of listening to the views of different \r\nsectors of society on central issues for our people. Our \r\nEveryone for a Better Life Plan includes four basic \r\npillars: restoring peace, generating investment and \r\nlarge-scale employment opportunities, supporting \r\nfamilies living in extreme poverty, and combatting \r\ncorruption and promoting greater transparency in the \r\nculture of the Honduran people.\r\nSince taking office eight months ago, I have been \r\ncompletely devoted to recovering and maintaining \r\npeace and tranquillity, creating opportunities with fairer \r\nconditions for everybody. We need more investment to \r\ncome to our country in order to create jobs that will \r\ntranslate into greater income for our families. To that \r\nend, Honduras has amended its Constitution to create \r\none of the best platforms in the world for investment and \r\nemployment. It is a very innovative. I am referring to \r\n14-54765 19/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nthe Zone for Employment and Economic Development, \r\nwhich is better known by its acronym ZEDE.\r\nThe Honduras ZEDE model is not just another free \r\ntrade zone, similar to the 3,500 that already exist in the \r\nworld. Ours is different because it is comprehensive. It \r\nis a jurisdiction with four dimensions: legal, economic, \r\nadministrative and political. The Honduran ZEDE \r\nis a L.E.A.P. zone, which in English means “to jump \r\nforward”. In Honduras, the ZEDE will help us take a \r\ncompetitive leap forward towards greater well-being. \r\nRather than joining the race to the bottom, Honduras \r\nhas decided to compete upwards, welcoming global \r\ninvestment through a special jurisdiction of the highest \r\nlevel to employ the most productive and profitable \r\nworkforce in a highly favourable location at the centre \r\nof the Americas, bringing the Pacific and the Atlantic \r\ntogether.\r\nIn the legal dimension, ZEDE offers a common law \r\nsystem, with compulsory arbitration and international \r\njudges. Economically speaking, we are competitive in \r\nan open market, with a series of agile simple regulations, \r\nwith highly attractive and sustainable incentives for the \r\ncreation of good jobs under decent conditions. In the \r\nadministrative dimension, ZEDE provides a technical, \r\nnon-political structure without bureaucratic obstacles \r\nthat is effective for companies that must operate at the \r\nspeed of the markets and technology in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, and with full guarantees of transparency \r\nand security within the rule of law. Finally, to attract \r\nlong-term investment and ensure good jobs, we \r\nguarantee political stability and transparency based \r\non international treaties and agreements, with the \r\nsupport of an international commission of 21 trustees to \r\nensure compliance with best practices for workers and \r\nthe investors. I invite everyone to discover the great \r\nopportunity Honduras offers the world.\r\nWe have also created a participatory model \r\nof Government enterprises and the private sector, \r\nwith mixed capital — in other words public-private \r\npartnerships. We are building an interoceanic logistical \r\ncorridor linking the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean, \r\nallowing us to move cargo between both Oceans in less \r\nthan six hours — I repeat, less than six hours. Our hope \r\nis to capture at least 5 per cent of the demand to move \r\ngoods from one ocean to another.\r\nWe have made progress, but we also recognize that \r\nmuch remains to be done. For example, there has been a \r\nrise in the number of Hondurans going abroad, including \r\nan unusual migration of children and vulnerable youth \r\nto North America, many unaccompanied by an adult. \r\nThis migration is the result of the violence created by \r\nthe movement of drugs through our territory, poverty \r\nand the lack of opportunities. Special attention must be \r\ndedicated to this phenomenon, especially in countries \r\nthat are responsible for the problem either because \r\nthey produce the drugs or because they are the market \r\nwhere the drug is consumed. We believe that this is a \r\nshared responsibility. Faced with the scant interest in \r\nsolving the problem shown but those who created it, we \r\nHondurans must stress this issue in every forum that \r\nwe possibly can, because we must speak clearly and \r\nforcefully about that issue.\r\nHonduran territory is today one of the main \r\nbattlefields of a war that is not our own. We did not start \r\nthis war. Its strategies are decided outside Honduras, \r\nand it involves drug-consuming countries in the North \r\nand drug producing countries in the South. It is a real \r\nmonster — a multinational, criminal octopus without \r\nnationalities, borders or scruples, which is dedicated \r\nto the trafficking, trade and consumption of drugs and \r\nto encouraging demand, especially in the wealthiest \r\nsocieties.\r\nThe drugs transiting through Honduras and \r\nCentral America destroy the lives and peace of our \r\npeople, our youth, our children and our women. From \r\nthose who orchestrate and organize the transnational \r\nactivity within our territory to ordinary citizens and the \r\nchildren involved as pawns in drug dealing and addicts, \r\nall are affected. They are all embarking on the path of \r\nno return, which will tear apart our society, destroy \r\nfamilies, corrupt officials and destroy institutions. I \r\ninvite members to ask themselves: Who are the real \r\nculprits in this cycle of death, misfortune, mourning, \r\nstruggle, blood and pain? It is not Hondurans, I can \r\nassure the Assembly of that.\r\nIn forums such as this, we need to agree on the \r\nbasic contours of the issue and the facts. We cannot, \r\nin the midst of crisis and without coming to useful or \r\nconcrete conclusions, put forward proposals based on \r\nlegalizing production and consumption, on the one \r\nhand, and on waging a merciless war on trafficking and \r\nillegal drug use, on all fronts and regardless of cost, \r\non the other. I ask myself, and I invite members to ask \r\nthemselves: Who are the true victims of this tragedy? \r\nAll those who cannot live in peace in modern society \r\nare victims, as are those who cannot live in society \r\nwithout using drugs. Society itself is a victim, as it is \r\nunable to organize its efforts and manage its resources \r\nin a rational manner so as to create new opportunities.\r\n20/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nHonduras produces and consumes practically no \r\ndrugs. We are a transit country. Unfortunately, we \r\nprovide only the battlefield and the dead. We provide \r\nthe resources to combat drugs’ transit through our \r\nterritory, and those are resources that we are prevented \r\nfrom investing in meeting our development problems \r\nand challenges. I repeat: we are not responsible for the \r\nwar.\r\nI think it is time to do what we have to do: respect \r\nhuman rights; follow what experts and our common \r\nsense are telling us; attack the problem at its root, \r\nonce and for all; and do it together and throughout the \r\naffected region. We must create a multinational force \r\ncapable of dealing successfully with a phenomenon \r\nthat is transnational in terms of its organization, its \r\nmarket, its projections and its financing. This morning, \r\nPresident Obama called for such unity in fighting radical \r\nfundamentalists. I would ask: What is the difference \r\nbetween the effects of terrorist acts perpetrated by \r\nradical fundamentalists and the effects of the terrorist \r\nacts perpetrated by those who traffic in drugs? What is \r\nthe difference?\r\nToday the international community is discussing \r\nwhat happens in other regions of the world when \r\nchildren, young people and families are displaced by \r\nwar, violence and radical extremists. Those are all \r\nsituations that we as a nation also condemn. Of course \r\nwe do. However, little is being said and about the \r\nthousands of families living in the northern triangle \r\nof Central America. I do not want to believe that this \r\nissue will simply be forgotten. As human beings, we \r\ncannot allow that to happen. I would once again ask \r\nthe Assembly: What is the difference between those \r\ndisplaced by violence in other regions and those \r\ndisplaced by the violence committed by drug traffickers \r\nand transnational criminals? What is the difference?\r\nOne difference is that those displaced — those \r\nthousands of families and individual children — come \r\nknocking on the doors of the United States of America. \r\nAs a region, we cannot continue to ignore this human \r\ndrama, which affects thousands of Central Americans, \r\nespecially unaccompanied migrant minors who, on \r\ntheir way to the United States, have been the victims of \r\nviolence, transnational crime, rape, human trafficking \r\nand the organ trade. Many have died or disappeared \r\nin the desert. We cannot forget that. Those children \r\ndeserve to be treated with dignity and respect. They \r\nare innocent victims. We are talking about innocent \r\nchildren just like our children and grandchildren. They \r\nare vulnerable human beings.\r\nI would like to inform the Assembly that yesterday, \r\nthe Secretary-General kindly agreed to have me, along \r\nwith the ministers of Guatemala and El Salvador, \r\npresent to him the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in \r\nthe Northern Triangle, which maps out an initiative to \r\nsupport and create opportunities so that our countrymen \r\nare able to stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity \r\nwith everyone in our region — and I repeat, everyone, \r\nbecause this cause is our common responsibility.\r\nAn important part of the solution to the child \r\nmigration problem is to create job opportunities for \r\ntheir parents there, in Central America, and to improve \r\nsecurity for young people there, in Central America. \r\nBoth issues are closely linked to the trade policies \r\nof the United States. We are not asking for financial \r\nassistance or charity. What we are asking for is just and \r\nequitable trade treatment, as is already given to other \r\ncountries in the world. What we want is to jobs, to create \r\nthose opportunities. Honduras supports efforts to unite \r\nthe world in peace and prosperity through just trade \r\nand better access to major world markets. Within that \r\nvision, and in the context of the current negotiations, \r\nwe demand that Honduras and Central America receive \r\nthe same commercial treatment as Asian countries do, \r\nin order to enable us to compete.\r\nTo be frank, the United States giving preferential \r\ntariffs and rules of origin to other countries and leaving \r\nHonduras and Central America out of that would lead \r\nto thousands of jobs being lost in our region and would \r\nlead more children to illegally cross the border. I say to \r\nPresident Obama, Congress, the North American people \r\nand the people of the world: Honduras is committed to \r\nsolving the child migration issue and to fighting drug \r\ntrafficking. Many of them know this, clearly, given our \r\ndetermination. But if there is not a reasonable degree of \r\ncoherence in our countries’ trade policies, as partners, \r\nwhat is the real message to our people in Central \r\nAmerica? What should Honduran children and their \r\nparents expect, in Central America?\r\nGiven the many problems we face as Hondurans, \r\nwe have learned to see every crisis as an opportunity, \r\nand my Government follows the Christian principles of \r\nsolidarity and the common good. We are promoting a \r\nvery ambitious programme called A Better Life, through \r\nwhich we are making small changes and solving big \r\nproblems. I am pleased to note that, now, some of those \r\nwith the biggest fortunes are also promoting solidarity. \r\nI invite us all to ask: How much money is enough for a \r\nhuman being to feel fulfilled?\r\n14-54765 21/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nHow much money is good enough?\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nA few days ago we read about the humanitarian \r\naction being undertaken by one of the world’s richest \r\nmen, Mr. Bill Gates, who, through his foundation, is \r\nseeking A Better Life in terms of health for thousands of \r\npoor families by promoting scientific research into new \r\ndesigns for basic sanitation systems. I think Mr. Bill \r\nGates found the answer to the question.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nHow much money is good enough?\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nAs we are working on the same issue, I take this \r\nopportunity, with the Assembly’s permission, to invite \r\nMr. Bill Gates, a citizen of the world, to my country to \r\nwork on this common endeavour.\r\nIt is very encouraging that some of the wealthiest \r\npeople in the world are not seeking the secret of eternal \r\nyouth, or trying to send expeditions to other planets \r\nwhile our brothers are dying on this one. On the \r\ncontrary, they are aware of the problems of their poorer \r\nbrethren. This is going on in many countries, including \r\nHonduras, where many good businesspeople have \r\nsigned on to work with our A Better Life programme \r\nand are demonstrating social responsibility by creating \r\njobs. And that is what this is all about — solidarity \r\nand social responsibility, but not romantic social \r\nresponsibility. In that regard, I would like to quote Pope \r\nFrancis, a citizen of the world, whose words I hope will \r\nring in our ears.\r\n“I have never seen a moving van following a funeral \r\nprocession, but there is a treasure we can take with \r\nus, a treasure that no one can take away — not \r\nthose things we have kept for ourselves, but what \r\nwe have given to others”.\r\nWe should think about that and consider those \r\nwords. Honduras is a country where 43 per cent of the \r\npopulation lives on less than a dollar a day, which is not \r\nenough to pay for a person’s basic nutritional needs. \r\nThat is why we are making a major effort to respond to \r\nthese people’s needs through the Better Life programme, \r\nthus enabling them to live with dignity. The Better \r\nLife programme is designed to respond to the needs of \r\n835,000 families, who are getting help in improving \r\ntheir homes, including providing access to drinking \r\nwater and basic sanitation, decent roofs overhead and \r\nf loors underfoot, family gardens and monetary support \r\nto ensure that children attend school, have improved \r\nhealth care and change their living conditions so as to \r\nachieve a better life.\r\nOur housing improvements include the use of \r\nclean stoves, reducing wood consumption and smoke, \r\nwhich is harmful to women and children’s health and \r\nwhich, according to the World Health Organization, \r\nkills 500,000 women around the world every year. In \r\nCentral America alone, about 35,000 people die from \r\nthe wood smoke emitted from dirty cooking stoves \r\nevery year. With every eco or clean stove installed, we \r\nmake a contribution to the rest of humankind by saving \r\n15 medium-sized trees every year, thus helping to \r\nprotect the environment. In that regard, I would like to \r\nhighlight the work of former United States Secretary of \r\nState Hillary Clinton for her Global Alliance for Clean \r\nCookstoves initiative, whose goal is to put clean stoves \r\nin 100 million households by 2020. On this subject we \r\nshare Mrs. Clinton’s vision and are working hard to \r\nachieve it.\r\nWhen presidents come to the General Assembly of \r\nthe United Nations, they often prepare speeches they \r\ndeem most appropriate and specific to the lofty heights \r\nof this great forum, but beyond the words themselves, \r\nthe message I want to convey is that the most important \r\nthing is for all of us to be accepted as citizens of the \r\nworld, with the same duty to fight and defend our \r\nterritory, our families and our planet, with the same \r\nright to aspire to a better life, and that what is vital is \r\nthe support of those who have the most to those who \r\nhave the least. If my message today can reach and move \r\na few to act, I think it will have been worth coming. I \r\nwould like to remind the Assembly that if we are part of \r\nthe largest forum in the world, it is because we consider \r\nourselves to be citizens of the world, human beings \r\nwith the same dignity, and therefore all of us, everyone \r\nof us, equal. Honduras is making progress; Honduras is \r\nchanging; Honduras sends its greetings to all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Honduras \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Filip Vujanović, President \r\nof Montenegro\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of Montenegro.\r\n22/23 14-54765\r\nA/69/PV.7 24/09/2014\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Filip Vujanović, President of \r\nMontenegro, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vujanović: I would first like to express \r\nmy great appreciation for the efforts of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon to promote and achieve peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity in the world. I would also like \r\nto duly acknowledge the work of Mr. John William \r\nAshe, President of the General Assembly at its previous \r\nsession, to offer my best wishes to President Kutesa \r\nfor his stewardship of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession, and to confirm Montenegro’s willingness to \r\ncooperate fully with him in his accomplishment of \r\nhis important duties. I emphasize the relevance of the \r\ntheme of the current session, since it is highly pertinent \r\nto our efforts to meet the Millennium Development \r\nGoals with the imminent arrival of 2015.\r\nAs ever, Montenegro remains committed to an \r\neffective multilateral system, resting on a strong United \r\nNations. As a responsible Member of the United Nations, \r\nMontenegro is therefore committed to continuing \r\nto contribute to strengthening the Organization and \r\nbuilding a functional, integrated system that promotes \r\nrespect for human rights, democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw, while devising and implementing global responses \r\nto global challenges. In that regard, we will continue to \r\nsupport the process of general reform and of system-\r\nwide coherence, as well as the integrated Delivering \r\nas One programme of action, based on successful \r\nimplementation at the national level. I am proud to \r\npoint out here that in March, in the most beautiful part \r\nof Montenegro’s capital city, Podgorica, we opened the \r\nUnited Nations Eco building, host to all the specialized \r\nUnited Nations agencies, and offering the best possible \r\nconditions for their work and their implementation of \r\nthe Delivering as One concept. I see this project as a \r\nstrong tool of reliable partnership for Montenegro in \r\nachieving fundamental United Nations goals.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMontenegro will continue to fully support the integration \r\nof human rights dimensions into all aspects of the work \r\nof the United Nations and to further strengthen the role \r\nof the Council in response to violations of human rights, \r\nwhile preserving the universality of international \r\nhuman rights law and the independence of the United \r\nNations human rights system. In our approach, the \r\nkey priority is to promote the rights of vulnerable \r\ngroups — children, youth, the elderly, persons with \r\ndisabilities, and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \r\npersons — and to promote gender equality and the fight \r\nagainst discrimination.\r\nPeace and stability, as preconditions for prosperous \r\ndevelopment, can be ensured through positive activism \r\nin global international organizations, primarily in \r\nthe United Nations, and the constructive approach of \r\nevery country in the sphere of regional policy, as well \r\nas a commitment to good-neighbourly cooperation. \r\nTherefore, Montenegro strongly promotes this \r\napproach in bilateral relations and regional initiatives \r\nin South-East Europe. We are certain that the success \r\nof Montenegro in the process of integration into \r\nthe European Union and NATO represents a major \r\ncontribution to the stability and opening up of prospects \r\nfor development of the wider Balkans region.\r\nMontenegro strongly supports global efforts \r\ntowards disarmament and non-proliferation. This year, \r\nwe ratified the Arms Trade Treaty, becoming the forty-\r\nfourth country to do so. Our ratification represents \r\nour contribution towards the entry into force of that \r\nhistoric Treaty, as well as an illustration of our firm \r\ncommitment to a responsible global arms trade.\r\nOpen and frozen conflicts, from Ukraine across the \r\nMiddle East to Africa, pose a threat to durable global \r\nstability. Of particular concern is the fact that the \r\nescalation of violence typically causes humanitarian \r\ndisasters and massive human rights violations. We \r\nfully advocate an urgent end to violence and a political \r\ndialogue that would lead to solutions in accordance with \r\ninternational law, the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. In that context, \r\nwe believe that the United Nations and international \r\ncommunity’s activities should place stronger emphasis \r\non better utilizing preventive measures under Chapter \r\nVI of the Charter, with a special focus on mediation as \r\na highly cost-effective tool for conflict prevention and \r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts.\r\nI would like to reaffirm Montenegro’s strong \r\ncommitment to the responsibility to protect as a matter \r\nof national priority. Montenegro welcomes the French \r\ninitiative to seek a code of conduct on the use of the veto \r\nin situations of genocide, war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and ethnic cleansing, and remains keen on \r\nputting that proposal into operation.\r\n14-54765 23/23\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.7\r\nThe rule of law and the protection of civilians in \r\npeacekeeping missions are of particular importance, \r\nand we stand for the consistent implementation of the \r\nmandates of United Nations peacekeeping missions, \r\nto which we are ready to contribute. Unfortunately, \r\nterrorism still poses an enormous threat to international \r\npeace and security, as evidenced by current events in the \r\nMiddle East. I consider it necessary to step up efforts \r\nat all levels in preventing terrorism, in accordance \r\nwith international instruments and the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\r\nMontenegro strongly promotes a sustainable \r\ndevelopment policy and, in line with our active \r\nparticipation in the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, we are committed to further \r\ncontribute towards the elaboration of a transformative \r\nand ambitious post-2015 development framework. I \r\nthink that the post-2015 development agenda must be \r\nbased on an approach of respect for and the promotion \r\nof human rights, where human development will truly \r\nensure that no one is neglected. Poverty eradication and \r\nsustainable prosperity for the benefit of all people and \r\nthe planet must be the overarching objective and guide \r\nthe design of a transformative development agenda.\r\nWe strongly support the important United \r\nNations mission implemented by the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) relating to human \r\ndevelopment, which essentially affirms fundamental \r\nhuman values. We are proud that two weeks ago, \r\nUNDP chose Montenegro to host the presentation of \r\nthis year’s Human Development Report for the South-\r\nEast Europe and Central Asia regions. We see this as \r\na recognition of Montenegro’s progress, affirmation of \r\nhuman development, and proof of a reliable partnership \r\nbetween Montenegro and the United Nations.\r\nFinally, I wish to emphasize the fact that the United \r\nNations has a responsible partner in Montenegro, which \r\nwill continue to promote and pursue the goals and \r\nvalues fostered by the Charter.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of Montenegro for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
