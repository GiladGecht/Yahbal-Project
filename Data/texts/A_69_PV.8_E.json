The theme that you have chosen for this general \r\ndebate and the sixty-ninth session, namely, “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”, is timely and most appropriate.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\ngalvanized and mobilized the international community \r\nand the United Nations in a manner never seen before. \r\nWe have good stories to tell about the journey of the \r\npast 15 years of implementing the MDGS. In Africa, \r\nwe seized the opportunity and adopted the New \r\nPartnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), our \r\nsociodevelopment blueprint. The African Union’s \r\nVision 2063 will, together with NEPAD and other \r\nsocioeconomic development programmes, be the \r\ncornerstone and foundation of Africa’s development \r\nagenda going forward. South Africa has also made \r\nsignificant progress in achieving the MDGs. Reducing \r\nby half the number of people earning less than a dollar \r\na day has been achieved, while the proportion of those \r\nexperiencing hunger has also been halved. South \r\nAfrica has attained Goal 2, namely, to provide access \r\nto primary education for all.\r\nBy official international indicators, South Africa is \r\nalso doing well on MDG 3 to promote and empower \r\nwomen. South Africa has recorded impressive progress \r\nthrough the expansion of its health infrastructure \r\nand improved access to health services for all South \r\nAfricans.\r\nOn the reduction of child mortality, MDG 4, and the \r\nimprovement of maternal health, MDG 5, significant \r\nprogress has also been recorded, but more work remains \r\nto be done. In fact. more work remains worldwide to \r\nfully achieve those goals, especially in the developing \r\nworld. We have to confront the underlying root causes \r\nthat continue to make it impossible for our people to \r\nhave a better life.\r\nIn spite of the progress that we have made thus far, \r\nreports continue to show that Africa is lagging behind \r\nin the attainment of some of the MDGs. It is for that \r\nreason that we appreciate the crafting of a post-2015 \r\nglobal development agenda that will carry forward the \r\nunfinished business of the MDGs. The post-2015 global \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.8\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n8th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 24 September 2014, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\ndevelopment agenda will provide a frame of reference \r\nfor our collective agreement on what has to be done. \r\nWe reiterate that developed countries should be reliable \r\npartners and meet their commitments to development \r\ngoals, such as contributing 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross national income towards official development \r\nassistance. We say that because it does not matter \r\nwhat the great Organization has achieved in the past \r\nsix decades if we do not deal comprehensively with the \r\nscourge of poverty, unemployment and diseases. The \r\npoor of the world will then consider everything done \r\nto have been a failure. Indeed, we would have failed in \r\nour duty if we succeed in preventing another world war \r\nbut continue to have children dying of malnutrition and \r\ntreatable diseases.\r\nThe recent outbreak of Ebola in some West \r\nAfrican States and the number of lives that have \r\nbeen unnecessarily lost provide a clear example of \r\nthe challenges that developing countries continue to \r\ncontend with. We believe that Ebola would have been \r\ncontained within a few days had the outbreak been in \r\nthe developed world. But now it has become a pandemic \r\nthat threatens the economies of affected African States.\r\nThe outbreak has thus exposed the challenges \r\nresulting from lack of capacity, lack of infrastructure \r\nand other limited resources in Africa. We are pleased \r\nthat the United Nations, under the leadership of the \r\nSecretary-General, is deploying a mission to coordinate \r\nefforts to combat the virus. South Africa stands ready to \r\ncontinue to provide whatever resources we have at our \r\ndisposal to assist the people and Governments of our \r\nsister countries of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. \r\nWe add our voice in calling for more resources to be \r\ndeployed so as to ensure that the virus is contained.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in supporting the \r\nstruggles of self-determination and freedom has been \r\nremarkable. South Africa is a shining example. Twenty \r\nyears ago, President Nelson Mandela thanked all \r\nnations for support from this very podium when South \r\nAfrica was readmitted to the United Nations as a free \r\nand democratic State. We are reminded of that fact on \r\nthis important day, which is National Heritage Day in \r\nmy country.\r\nSince 1994, South Africa has made significant \r\nprogress in transforming the apartheid State into a \r\ndemocratic one, founded on the values of human dignity, \r\nnon-discrimination, non-racialism and non-sexism, the \r\nrule of law and universal adult suffrage, as enshrined in \r\nthe Constitution. Given our history and heritage, we are \r\nmindful of our historic and moral responsibility in the \r\nglobal struggle against racism, racial discrimination \r\nand other intolerances. We will, in this regard, continue \r\nto be at the forefront of efforts to eliminate all forms of \r\nracism, racial discrimination and any other intolerance, \r\nincluding xenophobia and anti-Semitism.\r\nThe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nremain the primary framework adopted by a United \r\nNations conference in the fight against racism. We \r\nwill continue to support the struggles for freedom \r\nand self-determination, including the struggles of the \r\npeoples of Palestine and Western Sahara, who continue \r\nto experience occupation and colonialism of different \r\nforms. The people of Cuba also hold a special place \r\nin our hearts because of that country’s sacrifice for \r\nAfrican freedom. We will therefore continue to support \r\ntheir struggle for economic liberation.\r\nWhile the United Nations has done remarkably well \r\nin supporting self-determination, when it celebrates 70 \r\nyears of existence next year, this body may be found \r\nwanting by the people of Palestine. The Israeli-Palestine \r\nquestion is one of the oldest items on the United \r\nNations agenda, but progress remains elusive. In the \r\npast few months in particular, the world has witnessed \r\na devastating conflict that left a humanitarian crisis \r\nof shocking proportions. People in Palestine were left \r\nhomeless, with no medical facilities, no safe drinking \r\nwater, bereaved and having to care for the wounded \r\nafter a trail of destructive military actions by Israel.\r\nSouth Africa has condemned the actions of both \r\nIsrael and Hamas, and we have called for an immediate \r\ncessation of hostilities. Our strongly held view is \r\nthat there can be no military solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian question. We should all remain committed \r\nto the two-State solution, based on the 1967 borders, \r\nwith Palestine and Israel coexisting side by side in \r\npeace.\r\nOf concern in this matter has been the helplessness \r\ndisplayed by the United Nations, especially the Security \r\nCouncil during the current conflict. The United \r\nNations has the moral authority and legitimacy to unite \r\nthe world in promoting the quest for peace, justice and \r\nself-determination for the people of Palestine, while \r\naddressing whatever security concerns Israel may have. \r\nThis body must play its role without fear or favour and \r\nbe a beacon for all who suffer oppression in the world.\r\n14-54835 3/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nLet me reiterate that the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations next year provides an opportunity \r\nfor us seriously to reflect on the need to reform this \r\naugust body, moving beyond words to action. Ten years \r\nago, world leaders celebrating the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations agreed on the need for reform \r\nof the Security Council in particular. The decision \r\nremains valid and must be implemented. When we \r\nconvene here next year, in the seventieth year of the \r\nUnited Nations, we should be able to adopt a concrete \r\nprogramme that will guide us towards a strengthened \r\nUnited Nations and a reformed Security Council. Some \r\ncontentious aspects of the United Nations system, \r\nincluding the power of veto and the exclusion of regions \r\nsuch as Africa from the Security Council, are some of \r\nthe critical matters that cannot be ignored in the quest \r\nfor transformation.\r\nAmong the achievements of the Organization in its \r\nrecent history is the cooperation between the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations, particularly since the \r\nformation of the African Union Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture. In this regard, the full implementation \r\nof Security Council resolutions 1809 (2008) and 2033 \r\n(2012), on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations, particularly the African \r\nUnion, remains crucial. Progress has been made in a \r\nnumber of areas where this cooperation is in place, for \r\nexample in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The \r\ntwo affected subregional organizations, the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community and the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region, continue to \r\ntake significant strides with the support of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThis body celebrated the formation of a new State \r\nof South Sudan not long ago. Recent developments and \r\nthe ongoing conflict in South Sudan have resulted in \r\nloss of life and other dire humanitarian consequences. \r\nWe will continue to contribute as much as we can to \r\nfinding solutions working with the African Union and \r\nthis body. South Sudan should not be allowed to regress.\r\nNext year marks 20 years since the the Fourth \r\nWorld Conference on Women adopted the Beijing \r\nPlatform for Action. The anniversary provides an \r\nopportunity for the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to reflect and take forward the struggle \r\nfor the emancipation of women from all forms of \r\ndiscrimination.\r\nLast December, the world descended on South \r\nAfrica to pay last respects to our beloved Madiba. \r\nThose who did not come to South Africa honoured \r\nMadiba in various ways. We will continue to work with \r\nthe world to promote Madiba’s legacy and passion for \r\njustice, freedom, equality and human rights. We are \r\ngrateful to the General Assembly and the President of \r\nthe Assembly at the sixty-eighth session for the decision \r\nto establish the United Nations Nelson Rolihlahla \r\nMandela Prize that will be awarded to an outstanding \r\nindividual who will have demonstrated a commitment \r\nto the aims, objectives and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter. The Prize is a great testament to the \r\noutstanding individual that Madiba was and will always \r\nbe.\r\nAs we recommit to the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, let me once again borrow from the words of \r\nMadiba uttered on his historic inauguration day in 1994 \r\nwhen he said:\r\n“We understand it still that there is no easy \r\nroad to freedom. We know it well that none of \r\nus acting alone can achieve success. We must \r\ntherefore act together as a united people, for \r\nnational reconciliation, for nation building, for the \r\nbirth of a new world. Let there be justice for all. \r\nLet there be peace for all. Let there be work, bread, \r\nwater and salt for all. Let each know that for each \r\nthe body, the mind and the soul have been freed to \r\nfulfil themselves.”\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Didier Burkhalter, President of the \r\nSwiss Confederation\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Swiss Confederation.\r\nMr. Didier Burkhalter, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Didier Burkhalter, President of the \r\n4/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nSwiss Confederation, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Burkhalter (spoke in French):\r\n“A world in which people know how to solve \r\ntheir problems in peace without violence; a world \r\nof freedom and mutual respect; a world where all \r\nyoung people can look forward to finding work that \r\nallows them to live a happy life.”\r\nThat, in his own words, is the world that a young man \r\nfrom my country would like to see. His name is Damian \r\nVogt. He is in this Hall and represents Switzerland’s \r\nyouth at the United Nations. This week we work here \r\ntogether to make that world a reality.\r\nA little more than a year ago, another young person \r\nstood in this very place and addressed the world. She \r\nsaid:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“I speak not for myself, but for all girls and \r\nboys ... Those who have fought for their rights: \r\ntheir right to live in peace; their right to be treated \r\nwith dignity; their right to equality of opportunity; \r\ntheir right to be educated.”\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe entire world still remembers the words of \r\nMalala Yousafzai. The entire world still remembers \r\nher courage. What a difference in the lives that Malala \r\nand Damian have known. What a difference between \r\ngoing to school only at the risk of your life and going \r\nto school as a right — the right to a better life. And yet, \r\nMalala and Damian, like millions of other young people \r\naround the globe, want exactly the same thing: peace, \r\nhuman dignity, freedom and equality, an education, and \r\nan opportunity to work. The youth of today have a right \r\nto expect from all of us, we who represent the nations, \r\nthat we truly will be united in our commitment to do \r\neverything within our power to place in their hands \r\ntomorrow a world where humanity is synonymous with \r\nsecurity, freedom and prosperity.\r\nIt is a century now since the outbreak of the First \r\nWorld War, and 75 years since the beginning of the \r\nSecond World War. The memory of those cataclysmic \r\nevents imposes a duty on humankind to work towards \r\ngreater security and freedom, to bring about the \r\nconditions for prosperity, and to become an Organization \r\nof genuinely united nations that is effective as a true \r\nassembly of States at the service of the people. Here \r\nat the heart of the United Nations, Switzerland wishes \r\nto do its part by making the following twin objectives \r\na priority: strengthening international security and \r\nreforming the United Nations.\r\nThe security challenges are immense. At no time \r\nsince the Second World War has humankind seen so \r\nmany people displaced. More than 50 million men, \r\nwomen and children have been torn from their homes. \r\nThe story of each and every one of them is a human \r\ntragedy. Caught up in this current of insecurity are \r\nalso 75 million young people who, without work, face \r\na future without prospects. We are talking about one \r\nyoung person in 10 in the world, and in certain regions \r\none in two. Worse still, in ever more regions throughout \r\nthe globe there are waves of instability assailing the rule \r\nof international law and, in particular the principles of \r\nhumanitarian law, which are being ignored, violated, \r\nand swept away in the deluge.\r\nThis is extremely worrisome in the Middle East, \r\nabove all in Syria and Iraq. Switzerland condemns in \r\nthe strongest terms the brutal acts of the self-proclaimed \r\nIslamic State and the groups that have allied themselves \r\nwith it. Islam can, and must, like other religions, be a \r\nmessenger of peace, humanity and fraternity. As for the \r\nnations, they can and must be truly united as a constant \r\nreminder at all times and in all places of the supremacy \r\nof law over force.\r\nWhere serious violations occur, investigations must \r\nbe carried out. Here, the independent commissions of \r\ninquiry play an essential role, especially that of the \r\nIndependent International Commission of Inquiry \r\non the Syrian Arab Republic, to allow for genuine \r\nreconciliation and lasting peace. Switzerland and 60 \r\nother States have requested the Security Council to \r\nrefer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal \r\nCourt. We have also committed ourselves to an increase \r\nin our humanitarian aid in the region. The crisis in \r\nSyria must be dealt with as a whole, and we call on the \r\nparties to return to the negotiating table and to work \r\ntowards a political solution.\r\nSwitzerland calls on the Iraqi Government to \r\nensure accountability. It joins the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights in calling on Iraq to \r\nconsider accession to the Rome Statute.\r\nWith regard to all forms of extremism that can \r\nlead to acts of terrorism, it is important also to address \r\ntheir root causes to show young people that violence \r\nholds out no promise for the future. The establishment \r\n14-54835 5/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nin Geneva of the Global Community Engagement and \r\nResilience Fund was an important step in this direction.\r\nThe world in 2014 has witnessed a conjunction of \r\nmany crises — in the Middle East, in the Maghreb, in \r\nAfrica, and also in Europe, where war returned this \r\nyear with the crisis in Ukraine. This situation weakens \r\nthe security of the entire continent.Violations of the \r\nHelsinki principles and of international law, whether \r\nin the form of an illegal annexation of territory, such \r\nas that of Crimea by Russia, or of military incursions \r\nin eastern Ukraine, demand a firm response from the \r\ninternational community. But such a response must also \r\nbe balanced, leaving room for dialogue and cooperation \r\nso that open discussion remains possible. To simply \r\nisolate Russia from the rest of Europe will not solve \r\nany problems and will only create more, in Europe and \r\nbeyond. Stability can be restored in Ukraine and in \r\nEurope if we succeed in resolving this crisis by working \r\nwith Russia, not against it.\r\nThat stability will be all the more sustainable if the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) — of which Switzerland this year holds the \r\nchairmanship — is able to re-establish a firm basis for \r\nsecurity cooperation between the Euro-Atlantic and \r\nEurasian regions. Switzerland, in its capacity as current \r\nchair of the OSCE, fully supports the vital work of the \r\ncontact group for Ukraine and Russia. We are currently \r\ntaking steps to increase funding for the special civil \r\nmonitoring mission, that will also require additional \r\nsupport from the participating States, and we welcome \r\nthe excellent cooperation with the United Nations.\r\nIn today’s unstable world, Switzerland has made \r\nan active commitment to achieving greater security \r\nby focusing its efforts there where it can make the \r\ngreatest contribution — the prevention of conflicts. \r\nThe prevention of violence means, first and foremost \r\nmaking certain that a proper education is available to all \r\nand that there are opportunities for every young person. \r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s Global Education \r\nFirst Initiative. Switzerland is working to promote \r\neducation through massive open online courses and \r\nseeks to encourage the development of dual vocational \r\ntraining, combining school studies with on-the-job \r\napprenticeships. This calls for a joint commitment on \r\nthe part of the State and the social partners.\r\nIn addition, preventing tensions from arising \r\nrequires knowing how to give everyone a voice. At the \r\nheart of Switzerland’s history lies a willingness to share \r\npower, to engage in direct dialogue with minorities, \r\nand to distribute authority between central and local \r\ngovernment — an emphasis on consultation rather than \r\non confrontation. In order to better prevent and manage \r\ntensions in the world, we must strengthen the mediation \r\ncapacities of both the United Nations and regional \r\nsecurity organizations, particularly those of the largest \r\namong them, the OSCE.\r\nSwitzerland has decided to augment its \r\ncontributions to international development and \r\nhumanitarian cooperation. In the coming year we will \r\nbe allocating funds for this purpose amounting to the \r\nequivalent of 0.5 per cent of our gross national income. \r\nIn other words, to help the neediest inhabitants of our \r\nplanet, each person in Switzerland will be contributing \r\na little over one dollar every day.\r\nThe post-2015 process provides us with the chance \r\nto transform the world’s challenges into opportunities. \r\nThere must be a single agenda for universal sustainable \r\ndevelopment, with shared objectives. We must all act \r\nto ensure that they are truly achieved. If all nations \r\nare genuinely united, it lies within our power to \r\nmake certain that no one in the world need face a \r\nfuture of destitute poverty. It is within our power to \r\nmake certain that the creation of jobs and wealth, and \r\nthus also companies doing business contribute to the \r\ndevelopment of human rights and help to foster respect \r\nfor the limited resources of this Earth.\r\nToday there are crises that cannot wait for the \r\noutcome of discussions on an agenda, no matter how \r\nsustainable it may be. Switzerland has increased its \r\nhumanitarian commitment to the fight against the \r\nhorror of Ebola. Swiss-based research centres, among \r\nthe best in the world, are working to arrange for the \r\nclinical testing of vaccines. Similarly, we must also do \r\nall we can every day to protect the world’s youth from \r\nthe horrors of war. The place of children and young \r\npeople is in school and with their families and not on \r\nthe battlefield. Switzerland is intensifying its efforts to \r\nprovide better health protection for women, especially \r\nyoung girls, and has also launched an action plan to \r\ncombat the phenomenon of child soldiers, who are \r\nbeing deprived ofthe right to be simply children.\r\nIn order to meet these challenges we will need not \r\nonly the common will of the United Nations but also an \r\norganization that functions in an effective, transparent, \r\nand democratic fashion. “We the peoples of the United \r\nNations” are the opening words of the United Nations \r\nCharter. They are a reminder that the United Nations \r\nmust first listen to and serve the people of this world. \r\n6/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nIn concrete terms, this means that it must strengthen \r\nbodies that are dedicated to the prevention of conflicts. \r\nSwitzerland applauds the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to strengthen the commitment of the United \r\nNations to human rights, particularly in sensitive \r\nregions. My country has launched an appeal for the \r\nallocation of additional funds for those important \r\nactivities.\r\nThere is also a need to strengthen the United Nations \r\nspecial political missions to prevent conflicts and \r\nreinforce the activity of the Peacebuilding Commission. \r\nThe United Nations must devote all its energy to its \r\nwork in the field to serve the people. It must avoid \r\ngetting lost in an administrative maze. Together with \r\neight other countries, Switzerland has commissioned \r\na group of experts to draft recommendations for the \r\nreform of planning and budgeting processes.\r\nLastly, the ability of the United Nations to be \r\neffective in dealing with the challenges it faces depends \r\non the legitimacy it enjoys as well as its ability to be \r\ntransparent and inclusive in the Security Council. The \r\npermanent members ought not to use their veto to block \r\naction designed to prevent or put an end to genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity, or war crimes. Switzerland \r\nwelcomes the French initiative for a voluntary \r\nagreement by the five permanent members to restrain \r\ntheir veto power in cases of mass atrocities.\r\nOne day, many years ago, a young man travelling \r\nacross the north of Italy was horrified by the suffering \r\nhe witnessed on the battlefield at Solferino in the 1800s. \r\nThe young man’s name was Henri Dunant. With the \r\nhelp of local women, he cared for the wounded soldiers. \r\nLater, when he returned home to Geneva, he dedicated \r\nhimself to raising public awareness of the tragedy that \r\nhad taken place. Through his commitment, the Red Cross \r\nMovement was born. Through his persistence, the first \r\nGeneva Convention was signed, 150 years ago in 1864. \r\nThis document — which I am holding up here and will \r\ngive to the President of the General Assembly — is a \r\nreproduction of the original, in which States committed \r\nthemselves to providing assistance to wounded soldiers \r\nand ensuring respect for humanitarian principles. Thus, \r\ninternational humanitarian law was born.\r\nYet today, 150 years later, humanitarian law is \r\ntoo often violated or ignored. Switzerland and the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross were \r\ngiven a mandate to consult States and to issue \r\nrecommendations. We will present next year a specific \r\nproposal to strengthen respect for humanitarian \r\nlaw and to put in place some joint machinery and an \r\ninstitutional framework. For the past 150 years, the \r\nspirit of Geneva, the spirit of international law, has \r\nshone forth throughout the world like a beacon, a place \r\nof peace, a home to humanitarianism and a refuge for \r\nhumankind. Geneva is a gift, both for Switzerland and \r\nfor the world, and we would like to strengthen its role \r\nfurther by finding useful solutions for humankind. Like \r\nMalala and Damian, Henri Dunant dreamed of peace, \r\nfreedom and prosperity for the world. His story — the \r\nstory of the Red Cross and the Geneva Conventions — is \r\na message of commitment. The action of each one of us \r\ncan make a difference.\r\nIn a few days, Switzerland will rename one of the \r\nhighest mountain peaks in the Alps. It will henceforth \r\nbe known as Dunant Peak, after Henri Dunant, the \r\nfirst recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. Here, where \r\nthe nations come together, we have the power to \r\nmove mountains, as long as we stand united, working \r\ntogether to make the dreams of Damian and Malala and \r\nall young people in the world a reality. We owe them \r\na better world. We are capable of building that world \r\ntogether, if we find the will to work as nations truly \r\nunited in dialogue and action — united nations, whose \r\nGovernments draw their strength from the people, for \r\nthe people; united nations who draw their inspiration \r\nfrom the youth for the youth.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Swiss Confederation \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Didier Burkhalter, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chad\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chad.\r\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chad, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Deby Itno (spoke in French): The sixty-\r\nninth session offers us a theme that invites us to deepen \r\n14-54835 7/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nexchanges on the development model that we want for \r\nthe world post-2015. The theme, “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”, is perfectly in line with the theme of the sixty-\r\neighth session, “The post-2015 development agenda: \r\nsetting the stage”.\r\nAt previous sessions, we have acknowledged that \r\ndevelopment through the achievement the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) has not produced the \r\nexpected results for many States. Among the main \r\ncauses for this are the weakness of solidarity in financing \r\nthe Goals; their poor adaptation to the concerns and \r\nrealities of Africa; and the many global financial, \r\nfood, environmental and security crises that arose. The \r\nunanimously welcomed drafting of a post-2015 agenda \r\ngave us the opportunity to review the MDGs in greater \r\ndepth and to respond relevantly. Africa, for its part, has \r\nadopted a Common Position that requires the adherence \r\nof all States and their partners. This Common African \r\nPosition is part of the Africa Vision 2063. That is why \r\nmy country, Chad, fully supports it and hopes that \r\nthis approach will figure prominently in the post-2015 \r\nagenda.\r\nUnfortunately, we note that on the eve of the \r\nimportant post-2015 meeting, the same security risks \r\nremain. Armed conflicts and the phenomenon of \r\nterrorism are becoming persistant threats in several \r\nareas of Africa. They are aggravated by the migratory \r\nphenomenon that deprives our continent, Africa, of its \r\nworkforce. We must therefore join our efforts to bring \r\nadequate and energetic responses to these phenomena, \r\nwhich dangerously compromise the future of our \r\ncontinent.\r\nI take this occasion to hail the upsurge of \r\nsolidarity that we are witnessing on the part of the \r\ninternational community in combating terrorism \r\nand underdevelopment. Africa remains in favour of \r\nvarious strategies for security and development in the \r\nSahel initiated by the United Nations, the European \r\nUnion and many other organizations. We hope that the \r\nimplementation of these programmes will be effective \r\nso as to allow our continent to effectively combat these \r\nongoing phenomena.\r\nBeyond international support, these security \r\nchallenges require African countries to take their \r\nsecurity into their own hands by implementing laws \r\nthat will ensure security at the national, regional and \r\ncontinental levels. The countries of the Sahel — Burkina \r\nFaso, Mali, Mauritania, the Niger and Chad — have \r\nmobilized through the Group of Five countries of the \r\nSahel to combine their efforts in building a strong \r\nsystem of resilience, good governance, security and \r\npeace. It is well known that the security of one country \r\nor region is directly linked to its development, that of its \r\nneighbours, and thereby to that of the entire continent.\r\nThe terrorism summit convened by the African \r\nUnion Peace and Security Council, over which we \r\npresided on 2 September in Nairobi, was a part of \r\nthese constant efforts. It sought to consider in depth \r\nthe terrorist threat and to agree specific and concrete \r\nmeasures to consolidate the efficacy of collective \r\nactions against this scourge. The summit also gave us \r\nthe opportunity to highlight our solidarity with Kenya \r\nin particular, and more generally with the East African \r\nregion, which is facing the threat of the terrorist \r\nAl-Shabaab group.\r\nThe decision to create such mechanisms as the \r\nAfrican Capacity for Immediate Response to Crises \r\nor the African regional force for the Sahel-Sahara \r\nand Central Africa, was the fruit of this regional \r\nand continental resolve to respond appropriately to \r\nterrorism, which is progressively gaining ground in \r\nAfrica. We call on the countries of the Lake Chad Basin \r\nCommission to take the necessary measures to bring \r\nthe joint multinational force into operation in order to \r\ncombat the terrorist activities of Boko Haram.\r\nWith respect to conflict resolution, Chad continues \r\nto contribute to peace and reconciliation in Africa. \r\nThis goodwill is borne out by the organization on its \r\nterritory, at Amdjarass in the north, of a forum of peace \r\nand reconciliation between the warring brothers of \r\nDarfur. Chad welcomes the holding of the Brazzaville \r\nforum on reconciliation and inclusive dialogue between \r\nCentral African brothers, where it played an active part \r\nin seeking solutions to Central African crises.\r\nMy country welcomes the inter-Malian dialogue \r\ntowards a definitive return to peace and security in that \r\ncountry. It welcomes the reconciliation process under \r\nway in South Sudan to persuade the South Sudanese \r\nto take up the peace pipe. We are convinced that \r\nsincere dialogue and surpassing ourselves are virtues \r\nthat can assist in resolving these issues. My country \r\nwill continue to support this process of dialogue and \r\nreconciliation.\r\nRegarding the new Libya — a country that has barely \r\nbegun to exist as a homogenous entity after the fall of \r\nthe Al-Qadhafi’s regime and his assassination — the \r\n8/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nviolence has intensified and the people live in constant \r\nfear. Libya’s neighbours are striving to assist that \r\nbrotherly country to recover its stability. The entire \r\ninternational community is called upon to act on \r\nthe severe security situation in that country. Libyan \r\nbrothers of different political and social beliefs must \r\nunderstand that peace can come only from the Libyans \r\nthemselves. They must therefore resolutely commit to \r\na political settlement, the only proper path to ensure \r\npeace, unity and territorial integrity for Libya.\r\nChad, a neighbouring country of Libya, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, the Sudan and Nigeria, is hosting \r\nhundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced \r\npersons who have f led armed conflicts or terrorist \r\nthreats. Since 2003, we have welcomed more than \r\n500,000 refugees from these neighbouring countries \r\nand more than 200,000 Chadians repatriated from \r\nLibya and the Central African Republic for security \r\nreasons, including displaced Chadians. A national plan \r\nfor global response developed by the Government and \r\nits technical and financial partners has been adopted \r\nand is being implemented, but it requires the financial \r\nand material support of the international community.\r\nThese various conflict situations are compounded \r\nby other, no less important challenges such as poverty, \r\nunderdevelopment and illnesses. I note in particular the \r\nsevere Ebola crisis affecting certain countries on the \r\nAfrican continent, ravaging populations and gravely \r\naffecting the economies concerned. Chad will make \r\nits financial contributions to these countries. The \r\ninternational community must act, and act quickly, \r\nin a coordinated manner as the Ebola virus knows no \r\nborders. I commend the upsurge of solidarity on the \r\npart of the international community in containing the \r\nspread of this scourge.\r\nBeyond Africa, we call for a peaceful resolution \r\nto the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, and between \r\nIsrael and Palestine, to name but a few. On Palestine \r\nspecifically, we feel that the disproportionate use of \r\nforce and the human and material damage incurred \r\nin Gaza are unacceptable and challenge the human \r\nconscience. It is extremely urgent to find a solution \r\nto this conflict, which has lasted for far too long. We \r\ntherefore call on all parties for restraint and dialogue in \r\norder to reach a just, global and lasting solution.\r\nRegarding the embargo to which Cuba has been \r\nsubject for many years, we once again reiterate our call \r\nfor it to be lifted, pure and simple.\r\nPeace, stability and development are intrinsically \r\nlinked to respect for laws and universal shared values, \r\nof which justice is the basis. Nevertheless, we note \r\nwith regret that these universal principles are not often \r\nrespected, especially by the powerful of this world. This \r\nis the case for the International Criminal Court, which, \r\ninstead of being neutral, impartial and independent, \r\nseems more to practise double standards and only \r\npursues the weak. Some 90 per cent of indictees are \r\nAfricans.\r\nThe debate on the reform of the Security Council \r\nmust be concluded, taking into account the interests and \r\nconcerns of all States so that it ref lects the actual makeup \r\nof the world. It is unjust that a billion inhabitants live in \r\nthe only continent without a permanent representative \r\nin that organ.\r\nAt the national level Chad has a national development \r\nplan for 2013-2015 and a national programme for food \r\nsecurity which seek to ensure resilient and emerging \r\ndevelopment by 2025, supported by sustainable and \r\ndiversified sources of growth that create added value \r\nand employment. The plan ensures that each Chadian \r\nhas appropriate access to basic social services, decent \r\nhousing and to adequate training opportunities. I \r\nagain thank all our partners who announced their \r\nparticipation in financing these two programmes at the \r\nParis conference in June.\r\nIn order to promote a serene climate in national \r\npolitical life Chad has implemented mechanisms for \r\npolitical governance, the latest of which is the national \r\nframework for political dialogue created in April 2013. \r\nThis mechanism is better adapted to current political \r\nevents as it includes civil society along with political \r\nparties. These mechanisms have led to stability \r\nconducive to economic and social development in a \r\ncountry where challenges remain considerable.\r\nTo improve governance, Chad has adhered to the \r\nmonitoring mechanism of the African Union and the \r\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative. That \r\nadherence clearly demonstrates our resolve to manage \r\nour national resources in complete transparency. Chad \r\nwill continue to work to consolidate the rule of law and \r\ngood governance through substantial reforms of its \r\ninstitutions, to combat unemployment by creating jobs \r\nfor youth, and to combat poverty and food insecurity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Chad \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\n14-54835 9/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Ilves: In the 364 days since I last had \r\nthe honour to address this Assembly, the world has \r\nchanged dramatically. We have seen a profound change \r\nin the global security situation. We see unprecedented \r\nthreats to peace and security in post-Second World War \r\nEurope and the world, while terrorism, climate change, \r\nhuman rights violations and the spread of the Ebola \r\nvirus continue to be global challenges.\r\nWe need a concerted effort to achieve peace and \r\nstability in Europe and the Middle East, and to restore \r\nthe credibility of international law. No circumstances \r\ncan ever justify terrorism in any form. By signing \r\nUnited Nations anti-terrorism conventions States have \r\npromised to prevent and investigate terrorist crimes as \r\nwell as to refrain from supporting or tacitly tolerating \r\nthose crimes.\r\nThe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) \r\nposes a serious threat to the people of Iraq and Syria \r\nas well as the broader Middle East. This terrorist \r\norganization executes prisoners, kills civilians and \r\ncommits genocidal acts against religious and national \r\nminorities. Its brutality, barbarous crimes and extreme \r\nideology threaten all of humanity. It challenges the \r\nuniversal human values enshrined in United Nations \r\ndocuments. We must stop the terrorists. Estonia \r\ncommends all global efforts to fight the ISIL and other \r\nterrorist organizations and stands ready to contribute \r\nto those efforts. I should like to welcome the adoption \r\ntoday of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014), on \r\nforeign terrorist fighters.\r\nA quarter of a century ago in the annus mirabilis \r\n1989, Europe and the democratic world celebrated an \r\nhistorical sea change. The Berlin Wall fell. The Cold \r\nWar that had divided the world into hostile camps for \r\nhalf a century ended. This year we should celebrate an \r\nanniversary of the triumph of freedom and democracy. \r\nInstead, 2014 has turned out to be a year when the \r\ninternational order as we have known it since the \r\ncold war, has been violated and put in doubt. Cynical \r\ngeopolitics in international relations has once again \r\ncome to the fore. The international agreements upon \r\nwhich the stability of the post-Second World War \r\nsecurity architecture relied, have been compromised.\r\nLet me recall what we have collectively agreed \r\nupon. The Charter of the United Nations of 1945 \r\ndeclares:\r\n“All Members shall refrain in their international \r\nrelations from the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity or political independence of \r\nany state”.\r\nIn the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, all trans-Atlantic \r\ncountries agreed not to use force to change borders \r\nor challenge the political independence of any State. \r\nStates agreed to regard one another’s frontiers as \r\ninviolable; to refrain from making each other’s territory \r\nthe object of military organized occupation. No such \r\noccupation or acquisition would be recognized as legal. \r\nIn the 1990 Conference on Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope (CSCE) Charter of Paris for a New Europe, all \r\nsignatories, from Vancouver to Vladivostok, agreed to \r\n“fully recognize the freedom of States to choose their \r\nown security arrangements”.\r\nBy annexing Crimea and invading Eastern \r\nUkraine, one of the signatories has violated all of these \r\nagreements. Thus, we find ourselves in a completely \r\nnew and unforeseen security environment. We must \r\nenforce the fundamental agreements upon which our \r\npeace and security rely.\r\nThe Ukrainian crisis is not solely a conflict \r\nbetween two countries. It is not even solely a European \r\nissue. If instead of agreements and laws raw brute force \r\nwill apply in international relations; if changing State \r\nborders by force will become an accepted norm, then the \r\nstability of the whole world is threatened. As President \r\nObama said this morning, “This is a vision of the world \r\nin which might makes right” (A/69/PV.6, p. 11). And he \r\nadded, “We believe that right makes might” (ibid.). So \r\ndoes Estonia. We believe that too.\r\n10/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nSuch developments must be firmly condemned. \r\nThe international community cannot leave Crimea as \r\nit is now. We cannot accept frozen conflicts created for \r\ngeopolitical ends. Referendums that are in agreement \r\nwith international law cannot be arranged in two weeks in \r\nthe presence of foreign armed forces. The results of such \r\nreferendums cannot be considered valid. Independence, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity must remain the \r\nfundamental rights of States and nations. That includes \r\ntheir right to direct their own future and to choose their \r\nallies, as stated in the CSCE Paris Charter. Such free \r\nchoices by sovereign nations cannot be accepted as an \r\nexcuse for aggression. However, it was not Ukraine’s \r\nwish even to choose its security arrangements that was \r\nused as justification for aggression. Its mere desire to \r\nenhance trade and political relations with the European \r\nUnion, which is not a security arrangement, led to the \r\ncountry’s dismemberment.\r\nWhat can we do, then, to restore the validity of \r\ninternational agreements? There were warning signs \r\nof current events in Ukraine earlier. Alarm bells rang \r\nalready six years ago in Georgia, but few bothered to \r\nhear the wake-up call. We must take, therefore, conflict \r\nprevention more seriously. We must support States in \r\ntheir choice of democracy, the rule of law and human \r\nrights and decisions that follow from that. These recent \r\ndevelopments force us seriously to reconsider the role \r\nof the United Nations. How can one of the fundamental \r\ngoals of the United Nations, global peace and security, \r\nbe promoted when basic international agreements are \r\nignored, State borders are changed, and territories are \r\nannexed through force?\r\nWe cannot ignore that the Security Council has been \r\nparalysed as international justice has been manipulated \r\nand multiple crises have escalated. The Security Council \r\nneeds to be reformed. Its work methods and principles \r\nmust be revised, with special attention on the openness, \r\naccountability and transparency of its processes. The \r\npermanent members of the Security Council bear \r\nenormous responsibility in guaranteeing international \r\npeace. No permanent member should abuse the veto to \r\ncircumvent the principles of the United Nations Charter.\r\nHuman rights remain the most cherished of values \r\nof the United Nations. Unfortunately, respect for \r\nhuman rights can still not be assumed to be the norm. \r\nWe cannot accept arguments that for some countries \r\nhuman rights do not apply for cultural reasons. Human \r\nrights, as stated in the Universal Declaration, are \r\nuniversal, inalienable and inviolable. They are based \r\non the humanity and dignity of each and every person.\r\nNo peace or justice, stability or security can \r\nbe guaranteed unless the basic rights of all human \r\nbeings are respected and protected in every country \r\nby all Governments. We must, moreover, pay special \r\nattention to the rights of the most vulnerable groups. \r\nWomen’s rights must be protected everywhere. It is \r\ncrucial that empowering women and action against \r\ngender-based violence be implemented in accordance \r\nwith Security Council resolution 1325 (2000). We must \r\nrespect the rights of children and minorities, as well as \r\nthose of indigenous people. We must care for people \r\nwith special needs.\r\nFree speech remains a crucial right. Some States \r\nhave made efforts to stop the free f low of information \r\non the Internet and to divide cyberspace along State \r\nborders. This we must avoid. The Internet must remain \r\na universal platform for the uninhibited exchange of \r\ninformation. Estonia is proud to be a founding member \r\nof the Freedom Online Coalition, a community of 23 \r\nnations committed to promoting free speech online, and \r\nthe multi-stakeholder model of a free and open Internet. \r\nIt is a global initiative that brings together Governments, \r\nnon-governmental organizations, entrepreneurs and \r\nthink tanks.\r\nIn April, the Freedom Online Coalition gathered in \r\nour capital and issued the Tallinn Agenda, a statement \r\nexpressing our strongly shared conviction that all people \r\nare entitled to the same rights and freedoms, online as \r\nwell as off line. This is not a lifestyle question. The \r\nInternet is a driver of economic growth and a key tool \r\nfor development. Since the 1990s it has blossomed into a \r\nglobal network of nearly three billion users. Most of the \r\nnext billion Internet users will come from developing \r\ncountries. The United Nations post-2015 development \r\nagenda should recognize the importance of new \r\ntechnologies and e-services as a major contribution to \r\nthe security and prosperity of the world. As we grow \r\nmore dependent on digital services in our daily lives, \r\nwe become more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Cyber \r\nsecurity is essential, not just for protecting rights, \r\nbut also for economic prosperity. Cyberattacks can \r\nparalyse crucial services or infrastructure. They can \r\ncause enormous economic damage. Limiting access to, \r\nor censoring the contents of the Internet, however, is \r\nnot the answer to cyber insecurity.\r\n14-54835 11/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nAchieving sustainable development is essential in \r\norder to tackle some of the challenges we face. Even \r\nin the current fragile security environment, we must \r\ntake care of the future of the planet and work towards \r\na world where everyone can live a dignified life, \r\nfree from poverty, violence and exclusion. In today’s \r\ninterdependent world, this is hard to achieve without \r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe world today also faces the outbreak of a \r\ndeadly virus. This is no longer a local concern of a \r\nfew countries. Ebola has become an international \r\npublic health emergency. Despite efforts already made \r\nby Governments and international organizations the \r\noutbreak races ahead. We support the efforts of the \r\nGlobal Ebola Response Coalition tasked to contain and \r\nstop the spread of the virus.\r\nClimate change is already an existential threat \r\nto some countries. It has a dramatic impact on their \r\nliving conditions and their security. The small island \r\ndeveloping States are most vulnerable. If we do not act \r\nsoon enough other countries will be threatened as well. \r\nWe must see this problem globally, not just from the \r\nperspective of short-term national or economic interest.\r\nThe risks of conflict, violence, insecurity, financial \r\nand economic collapse, climate change, lack of resources \r\nand natural disasters are inextricably intertwined and \r\nneed to be addressed comprehensively. The new post-\r\n2015 development agenda must be truly universal. \r\nSustainable development goals are best addressed \r\ntogether. Progress in these fields will be guaranteed by \r\ngood governance, transparency of decision-making and \r\nlow corruption. Effective and accountable institutions \r\nare powerful enablers of sustainable development, and \r\nmodern digital technology helps us to create them. In \r\nEstonia, we have developed an e-governance system \r\nthat increases transparency and limits corruption. \r\nWe have been sharing the system with all interested \r\npartners and we continue to be willing to do so.\r\nSince 8 May 1945, we have believed that we had \r\nbeen freed of certain ideological demons for good. Yet \r\ntoday we see the return of long-discredited ideas dating \r\nback to 1938. The existence of co-ethnics abroad has \r\nbeen used as a justification to annex territory. This is in \r\n2014, not in 1938. So, too, we have seen a return to the \r\nideologies of hatred, lies and propaganda. We must be \r\nclear in condemning extreme nationalism, homophobia, \r\nxenophobia and religious extremism. We need to recall \r\nand reaffirm the values that the United Nations was \r\ncreated to protect. The United Nations, a unique global \r\ninstrument of security and peace, must succeed where \r\nthe League of Nations once failed.\r\nLet us not forget that 75 years ago, on 23 August \r\n1939, a pact was signed between Hitler’s Germany \r\nand Stalin’s Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to \r\ndivide Eastern Europe into their spheres of influence. \r\nA week later, on 1 September, Hitler attacked Poland. \r\nOn 17 September, two and a half weeks later, Hitler’s \r\nerstwhile ally, the Soviet Union, also attacked Poland, \r\nand the Second World War had begun.\r\nThe date of 31 August this year marked 20 years \r\nsince the occupation forces left Estonia — troops that \r\nwere there as a result of that same Stalin-Hitler pact. Yet \r\njust a few days later on 5 September, an Estonian police \r\nofficer was abducted by foreign security services on \r\nEstonian territory and taken by force to Moscow, where \r\nhe is still being held in the infamous Lefortovo prison.\r\nWe cannot allow anyone ever to divide countries \r\ninto spheres of influence. The community of nations is \r\nonly secure when its smallest members can feel secure. \r\nWe cannot and will not accept threats and intimidation \r\nin twenty-first century international relations. We \r\ncannot have peace, security or prosperity in Europe, or \r\nin the world, unless we again find a way to enforce and \r\nrevalidate the agreements that we have all signed and \r\nare parties to.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Estonia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\n12/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke \r\nin Spanish): I bring with me to this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly greetings of peace, friendship and \r\nsolidarity from the people of Equatorial Guinea and \r\nthe full readiness of their Government to contribute to \r\nour common task of maintaining peace and stability \r\nthroughout the world, and promoting the harmonious \r\ndevelopment of humankind.\r\nAllow me at the outset to congratulate you, Sir, on \r\nyour brilliant election to preside over the work of this \r\nsixty-ninth ordinary session of the General Assembly. \r\nYour well-deserved election is justified by the policy \r\nof peace, respect for the principles of international \r\nlaw and the promotion of development advocated by \r\nyour country, the Republic of Uganda. Indeed, your \r\ndecision to devote this session of the General Assembly \r\nto the theme “Delivering on and implementing a \r\ntransformative post-2015 development agenda” is \r\ntestament to Uganda’s interest in overcoming the \r\ncurrent problems of underdevelopment throughout the \r\nworld.\r\nEquatorial Guinea recognizes the relevance and \r\nimportance of the topics to be debated at the two high-\r\nlevel meetings proposed for 2015 — one in February, \r\nto consider ways of implementing the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, and the other in March, on gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women.\r\nWe also wish to convey our sincere appreciation and \r\ncongratulations to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\noutstanding work at the head of the global Organization \r\nin very difficult international circumstances marked \r\nby terrorism, piracy, mercenary activities and major \r\nepidemics affecting the world today. Indeed, this session \r\nof the General Assembly bears the heavy responsibility \r\nof finding solutions to the problems of the poverty \r\nand hunger prevalent throughout the world, violence \r\nand armed conflicts, terrorism, piracy and mercenary \r\nactivity, and major epidemics, such as the recent Ebola \r\nepidemic that is now laying waste to some countries \r\nin Africa. Given Ebola’s deadly effects and the lack \r\nof adequate resources to combat it, on the occasion of \r\nthe award of the second UNESCO Equatorial Guinea \r\nInternational Prize for Research in Life Sciences, the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea \r\nannounced a donation of $2 million to the World Health \r\nOrganization to finance programmes to combat Ebola.\r\nThe United Nations will not be able to find solutions \r\nto these thorny problems unless the role of the General \r\nAssembly, which in recent years has grown routine, is \r\nstrengthened and revitalized. The United Nations will \r\nnever be able to find lasting solutions to these problems \r\nif the Security Council is not governed by rules that \r\nrespect the spirit of democracy and international \r\njustice. Ultimately, the United Nations will not be able \r\nto find satisfactory solutions to these problems as long \r\nas the current system of the rule of force in international \r\nrelations persists.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea is therefore very \r\nconcerned by the proliferation of acts of intervention \r\nthat do not respect the principle of non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States. These interventions \r\ninterrupt the process of genuine democracy in the \r\naffected countries in that they ignore the essential \r\ncharacteristics and idiosyncracies of those societies, \r\nthereby further fuelling divisions and the sociopolitical \r\ninstability of nations. We must distinguish clearly \r\nbetween support for a genuine internal democratic \r\nprocess and interference perpetrated through pressures \r\nthat lead to misunderstandings, intolerance, exclusion, \r\nresentment, hatred among citizens and fratricidal wars.\r\nIn Equatorial Guinea we say that democracy is \r\nnot an imported product and cannot be designed in \r\nthe offices of other countries. Democracy is shaped by \r\nthe application of the positive values characterizing a \r\nsociety, and only the people are entitled to define the \r\nmodel that best suits them and to beat their own path \r\ntowards their own development. With this as our vision, \r\nin 1982 the Republic of Equatorial Guinea adopted the \r\ntheory of democratic experimentation, which gave our \r\nown citizens, through community councils, a hand \r\nin designing their own political development, the \r\nimplementation of which has given rise to the current \r\nclimate of peace, stability and economic prosperity \r\nthrough successive political reforms.\r\nThe latest of these reforms is making Equatorial \r\nGuinea a modern democratic State in which popular \r\nparticipation and representational politics are ensured \r\nat the highest possible level. The transfer of power is \r\nguaranteed by equal rights for all political options. \r\nPublic affairs are administered with the utmost \r\ntransparency, accountability and responsibility, and \r\nhuman rights are protected and monitored by reliable \r\ninstitutions.\r\nIn this spirit of ensuring the participation of all \r\ncitizens of Equatorial Guineans in the management and \r\nadministration of public affairs, our Government has \r\nextended an invitation to all political parties — those \r\nwithin the country and those in the diaspora alike — to \r\n14-54835 13/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nattend a national dialogue that will be held in November \r\nas an opportunity to strengthen democracy in our \r\ncountry as a positive experience in our democratic \r\nexperiment, which has yielded fruit since its inception \r\nin 1982.\r\nConcurrently with this political process, and thanks \r\nto the peace and political stability that we have achieved, \r\nour Government has undertaken economic initiatives to \r\ndevelop our natural resources and position Equatorial \r\nGuinea as an economically emerging country by 2020. \r\nOn behalf of the people of Equatorial Guinea, I wish to \r\nthank those countries that have been cooperating with \r\nmy Government in developing our economic and trade \r\nrelations, in particular the United States of America, \r\nthe People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba, \r\nFrance, Brazil, Russia and Morocco.\r\nIn conclusion, and with the fervent wish to see the \r\nUnited Nations recover its leading role in delivering \r\npeace, security and global development, I wish the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly every \r\nsuccess.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Socialist \r\nRepublic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajapaksa: I congratulate you, Sir, on \r\nbeing elected as the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session. We wish you success and \r\nassure you of our fullest cooperation.\r\nThe theme for this session “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda”, is timely. The world has undergone many \r\nchanges since the United Nations was created, and \r\nsince the year 2000 much progress has been made \r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nHowever, there are multiple challenges that still remain \r\nto be addressed. The moral and practical importance of \r\ncreating an equitable world and a sustainable planet for \r\nthis purpose cannot be ignored.\r\nThe Commonwealth, of which Sri Lanka is the current \r\nChair-in-Office, accounts for more than one-quarter \r\nof the United Nations membership. In November 2013 \r\nthe Commonwealth Heads of Government agreed \r\nin Colombo to contribute to the process of evolving \r\nthe new post-2015 global development agenda. They \r\nhave endorsed the central focus on the eradication \r\nof extreme poverty and reaffirmed commitments to \r\nsustainable development. The perspective on the post-\r\n2015 development agenda is based on shared values \r\nand principles contained in the Commonwealth Charter \r\nand individual experiences. The Commonwealth \r\nleaders encourage others to approach the forthcoming \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in a collaborative spirit \r\nto achieve a balanced post-2015 development agenda.\r\nReducing inequality within and among countries \r\nis one of the most transformative goals that have been \r\nproposed by the Open Working Group on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We hope that this goal will serve \r\nto enhance the voice and representation of developing \r\ncountries in decision-making. The post-2015 agenda \r\nmust focus on implementation. Achieving the \r\nsustainable development goals would be impossible \r\nwithout the political will and dedication of all countries. \r\nIt must be ensured that the failure of the developed \r\ncountries to fulfil Millennium Goal 8 that called for a \r\nglobal partnership for development is not repeated. \r\nIn determining goals, countries must not be \r\ndeprived of policy space to set their own domestic \r\npriorities. Instead of asking countries to reprioritize \r\ndomestic spending, the focus should be on a \r\nstrengthened partnership between developed and \r\ndeveloping countries, backed by sincere commitment. \r\nThat is essential for countries in the South to access \r\nfinancial resources and technology that are essential for \r\ncapacity building.  It is vital that we also address \r\nstructural obstacles and political barriers that prevented \r\nthe realization of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nsuch as unfair trade and investment rules. Creating \r\n14/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\na supportive international economic environment, \r\nenhanced investment f lows, including from multilateral \r\ndevelopment banks, and an open multilateral trading \r\nregime, are important.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in advancing \r\ninternational peace, security and prosperity is crucial \r\nin the contemporary world. However, in order to gain \r\nthe confidence and good will of the international \r\ncommunity as a whole, one of the essential requirements \r\nis consistency of standards across the board without \r\nany perception of selectivity or discrimination. It is in \r\nthis context that the current functioning of the system \r\nneeds examination in order to enhance its credibility. \r\nHuman rights are used as a tool to implement motivated \r\nagendas with no understanding or appreciation of \r\nthe complexity of issues in the countries concerned. \r\nHuman rights should be recognized by all as a moral \r\nand ethical concept rather than as a political tool. \r\nExternal intervention without adequate consideration \r\nof the structures in a society and cultural traditions \r\nof countries where such intervention takes place, \r\ninevitably results in destabilization, which is very much \r\nin evidence today in most parts of the world.\r\nMs. Gunnarsdóttir (Iceland), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nPost-conflict Sri Lanka has also become an \r\nunfortunate victim of ill-conceived agendas of some \r\nin the Human Rights Council who pay scant regard \r\nto the substantial progress achieved by Sri Lanka in \r\nreconstruction, rehabilitation and reconciliation within \r\na short span of five years. There is an obvious lack \r\nof balance and proportion in the manner in which my \r\ncountry is being targeted today, disregarding these \r\nsignificant achievements. That is in sharp contrast to \r\nthe approach to deeply disturbing situations involving \r\nhumanitarian emergencies elsewhere.\r\nIf multilateralism is to remain relevant and \r\neffective, reform of the institutions concerned is \r\nessential. To be successful this process must involve \r\nde-politicization of the United Nations systems and \r\nmechanisms and they must stop being a hostage to \r\ndifferent forms of funding. United Nations bodies must \r\nfind ways to work with governments through dialogue, \r\ngreater understanding of situations, and cooperation, \r\nincluding assistance to strengthen national institutions. \r\nThis approach, instead of strong-arm tactics, must form \r\nthe heart of multilateral diplomacy in the search for \r\nsustainable solutions to global challenges.\r\nThe seventieth year of the United Nations in 2015 \r\nalso marks the tenth anniversary of the 2005 World \r\nSummit where global leaders agreed to support early \r\nreform of the Security Council. Concrete results in this \r\nregard should be achieved next year at least.\r\nClimate change is one of the defining challenges of \r\nour times. A robust global response needs to be arrived \r\nat in 2015 on the basis of equity and the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities.\r\nThe increase in violence in the Middle East is \r\ndeeply distressing. I reiterate Sri Lanka’s support for \r\nthe early realization of a sovereign, independent, viable \r\nand united State of Palestine, existing within secure \r\nand recognized borders, side by side and at peace \r\nwith Israel. We look forward to welcoming Palestine \r\nas a full Member of the United Nations at the earliest. \r\nThe international community must assist Palestine to \r\nrebuild the country.\r\nSri Lanka firmly believes in the need for solidarity \r\nbetween Asia and Africa. Admiring the efforts of the \r\npeople of Africa to achieve socioeconomic development, \r\nSri Lanka has begun a process of reaching out to \r\ncountries in Africa for an exchange of knowledge and \r\nexpertise in areas of importance. The international \r\ncommunity must strongly support the early eradication \r\nof deadly diseases in Africa.\r\nSri Lanka remains committed to supporting all \r\nmultilateral efforts to counter terrorism deriving from \r\nextreme ideologies impacting on people across national \r\nfrontiers. Terrorism continues to be a grave threat to the \r\nsecurity and stability of nations throughout the globe. \r\nHaving suffered at the hands of terrorism, Sri Lanka \r\nknows well its drastic impact on societies, communities \r\nand institutions founded on democratic traditions and \r\nideals. The international community must strengthen \r\nmultilateral action on terrorism, including the early \r\nfinalization and adoption of the United Nations \r\nComprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.\r\nSri Lanka is also committed to supporting all \r\nmultilateral efforts to counter terrorism financing, \r\npiracy and all forms of international organized crime. \r\nWe wish to recall our appeal to the international \r\ncommunity not to support terrorist groups in any way, \r\neither directly or indirectly. Sri Lanka expresses its \r\nconcern regarding bombings that kill innocent civilians \r\nand even unborn children in many situations across the \r\nworld.\r\n14-54835 15/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nSri Lanka expresses deep concern regarding \r\nunilateral economic measures against developing \r\ncountries and is a consistent supporter of the call of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for an end to the unjust economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba. \r\nUnilateral sanctions of this nature, which impact on a \r\ncountry’s innocent population, are unethical.\r\nDespite being affected by terrorism, Sri Lanka has \r\nachieved most Millennium Development Goals. Sri \r\nLanka has succeeded in being ranked ahead of all South \r\nAsian countries in the 2013 Human Development Index. \r\nThrough the adoption of the National Development \r\nStrategy — the Mahinda Chinthana, or Vision for the \r\nFuture — the Government of Sri Lanka embarked on \r\nan inclusive and rural-centric development programme. \r\nThat involved bold policy decisions connected with \r\nmacroeconomic management, revitalization of \r\nagriculture, infrastructure development, including \r\nroads and expressways, ports and airports, irrigation and \r\nwater distribution, a strong telecommunication network \r\nand well-distributed urban and township development \r\nresulting in 7.8 per cent gross domestic product growth \r\nthis year and per capita income of $3,280 in 2013. It \r\nis also a matter of deep satisfaction to recognize that \r\nthe economic and political empowerment of the people \r\nof the North, supported by massive investment in \r\ninfrastructure and livelihoods, have also contributed to \r\nthis growth.\r\nSri Lanka’s information technology literacy grew \r\nsteadily from a mere 3 per cent in 2005 to almost \r\n50 per cent in 2014. Sri Lanka’s Nenasala Programme \r\nwas awarded the prestigious Bill and Melinda Gates \r\nFoundation Award as the best rural information \r\ntechnologyaccess programme in the world.\r\nWith the end of terrorism in May 2009, in keeping \r\nwith my responsibilities to my people, large-scale post-\r\nconflict reconstruction, rehabilitation and resettlement \r\ninitiatives were implemented in the north in a relatively \r\nshort period of four years. Most importantly, democratic \r\nstructures in the North have been re-established. \r\nElections to the Northern Provincial Council were held \r\nin September 2013 after a lapse of 28 years, upholding \r\nthe democratic tradition in Sri Lanka which has been \r\nconsistently protected since 1931, the year we attained \r\nuniversal franchise.\r\nI recall in this context the visit to Sri Lanka of the \r\nSecretary-General just a week after the conclusion of \r\nthe conflict, when a new era of peace had dawned. That \r\nwas a manifestation of the close cooperation between \r\nmy country and the United Nations and our commitment \r\nto working together in the future.\r\nWe continue on a deeply satisfying and transformative \r\njourney in the interests of all the people of Sri Lanka. In \r\ncarrying out this task we work in accordance with our \r\ntraditional foreign policy of friendship towards all and \r\nenmity towards none. We hope that the international \r\ncommunity will reciprocate and assist Sri Lanka in \r\nits domestic process of reconciliation and economic \r\ndevelopment without exerting undue pressure on us.\r\nWe have gained inspiration from the words of \r\nGautama the Buddha who said that the purpose of all \r\nhuman endeavour must be to construct order out of \r\nchaos and harmony out of strife. True to these words \r\nof wisdom, the Government of Sri Lanka remains \r\ncommitted to its objective of pursuing the processes of \r\nreconciliation and nation building, undeterred by ill-\r\nmotivated criticism.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahinda Rajapaksa, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President \r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Maduro Moros (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, as this is the first time that I am attending in \r\nmy capacity as the President of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela, I wish to thank the General Assembly, \r\nall its representative Governments and the various \r\nbodies of the United Nations system for the heartfelt \r\ntribute that was paid simultaneously at United Nations \r\nHeadquarters in New York, in Geneva and other \r\n16/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nplaces in the world to an extraordinary human being, \r\nCommander Hugo Chávez, who always carried the \r\nbanners of peace, equality and respect for our peoples. \r\nThat is the first thing I wish to convey from my heart \r\non behalf of the people of Venezuela and to recall and \r\ninvoke his spirit of tackling imperialism and injustice.\r\nWe have had debates for several decades now on the \r\nneed to reform the Organization, and various Presidents \r\nthat have presided over the Assembly. This morning, I \r\nstrongly reminded Presidents Dilma Rousseff, Cristina \r\nFernández, Evo Morales Ayma and other Presidents \r\nof the Americas of the need to reorient, readjust and \r\ntweak the entire United Nations system. This system \r\nhas been in place for 70 years since the end of the so-\r\ncalled Second World War, which took place in Europe \r\nand other parts of the world between 1939 and 1945.\r\nThe United Nations Charter is one of the most \r\nbeautiful poems that we could ever read. It has well \r\nand truly become an instrument that has been set \r\naside, overlooked and consistently f louted in terms of \r\nits fundamental objectives are concerned. The United \r\nNations is an historic human experiment that has become \r\na landmark because never before has humankind had \r\na forum to meet to address issues of peace, affecting \r\nlife and death, and to negotiate solutions to conflicts. \r\nAfter 7,000 years of civilization as we know it — a \r\nreview of which reveals a history of empires and the \r\nongoing battle to distribute the wealth and territory of \r\nthe world — only with the establishment of this system \r\nin 1945 did we begin to get a glimpse of future light \r\nat the end of a long tunnel of battles, wars and global \r\nconflicts.\r\nWe call for the renewed relevance of the United \r\nNations, above and beyond any criticism that may be \r\nlevelled against it. Given the human importance of \r\nthis institution, we insist on the need for an in-depth \r\ntransformation, as Commander Hugo Chávez said on \r\nmany occasions right here in this Hall. In his famous \r\nstatements in defence of the causes of humankind, \r\nhe stressed the need for a far-reaching democratic \r\noverhaul of the United Nations system. As President \r\nJacob Zuma of our sister country South Africa said, we \r\nmust democratize and overhaul the Security Council.\r\nThe role of the regions today is different from \r\nwhat it was in 1945. This is another world. The United \r\nNations was born to deal with post-war reconstruction \r\nand the issues that had given rise to conflicts. The \r\nUnited Nations has to deal today with a multicentric, \r\nmultipolar world of numerous actors, with emerging \r\ncountries and regions that have their own thoughts, \r\naspirations and desire to be respected in this world. The \r\nUnited Nations has to adapt and submit to the broader \r\nsovereignty of the peoples of this world, who are crying \r\nout for their voices to be heard, heeded and respected.\r\nWe have heard speeches today at the start of this \r\nsixty-ninth session. We also believe in strengthening the \r\nrole of the Secretary-General. As we have said so many \r\ntimes we must have a Secretary-General who represents \r\nall of us and who has the political and institutional \r\nclout to find solutions to the world’s conflicts. We must \r\nreconfigure the system and functions of the General \r\nAssembly. We must democratize it and give it a leading \r\nrole to ensure that the great debates that take place here \r\ncan always successfully address the major issues facing \r\nthe world. That is why we believe that we must build a \r\nnew United Nations in a bid for a new multipolar world \r\nof peace where there no empire can impose its will on a \r\nunipolar world. This is urgent for the entire world.\r\nAbove and beyond what officials of the various \r\nGovernments represented in this Hall may believe, \r\nwe already have another world where we all wish to \r\nspeak, think and decide our own fate and to achieve \r\npeace for our peoples. A new regionalism has come to \r\nthe fore. In the late 1940s and the 1950s, we saw the \r\nbirth of the European Union as an experiment in the \r\nnew regionalism that is admired and emulated by many \r\nthroughout the world. In the 1970s and 1980s, we saw \r\nthe emergence of the Organization of African Unity, an \r\nextraordinary system to organize the brotherly African \r\ncontinent to address the issues of development and \r\nlife. Our mother Africa was one of the most suffering \r\nregions the world.\r\nNow as we embark on the twenty-first century, \r\nLatin America is taking its place. We have seen new \r\norganizations arise in Latin America. On 14 December, \r\nwe will commemorate in Havana, Cuba, a heroic \r\nisland and great homeland, the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas. We have \r\nassumed an important role in building a new social \r\nand economic order in defence of such major causes \r\nas climate change. In existence for 10 years now, that \r\nyouthful organization, partnership or alliance is now \r\nlooking forward to the rest of the twenty-first century.\r\nI would also mention Petrocaribe and its \r\n18 brotherly member States. I hope I may be forgiven if \r\nI seem immodest, but PetroCaribe is a model that best \r\nshows how we can have a new world of peace, justice, \r\nsolidarity, cooperation and complementarity among \r\n14-54835 17/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nnations. To the powerful of the world, those who wield \r\nall the capital and all the economic power, I say that we \r\ncan have another world. We are starting to build it in \r\nthe Americas.\r\nAlso emerging is the Union of South American \r\nNations (UNASUR), representing a new southern \r\nregionalism that was founded on 16 April 2007 with the \r\nparticipation of new leaders in Latin America and our \r\nCommander Hugo Chávez. It is a most interesting and \r\nimportant bloc that is now starting to forge ties with the \r\nrest of the emerging world.\r\nWe recently held a very interesting and important \r\nmeeting for the remainder of the decade between the \r\nBRICS countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China and \r\nSouth Africa, who represent the hope for development \r\nthrough new mechanisms — and UNASUR in Brasilia, \r\nand we decided to share our experiences. The BRICS \r\nBank and the Banco del Sur would be a new financial \r\narchitecture for the world that must emerge from this \r\nnew regionalism. The Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States (CELAC) was established on \r\n3 December 2011 in Caracas, and is already growing \r\nstrong. We have held summits in Santiago de Chile and \r\nHavana and will hold another in San José in January. \r\nAll of Latin America is coming together optimistically \r\nin this new regionalism.\r\nBased on this experience, we are seeing new \r\nstructures arise towards the establishment of a road \r\nmap for overhauling the United Nations system. Let \r\nthe call for reform of the Organization not fall through \r\nthe cracks here in this Hall. We must find the way. \r\nWe must try to come up with a common road map for \r\nhumankding because we need it if we are to tackle the \r\nmajor issues before us.\r\nFor 22 years, the United Nations has customarily \r\nvoted with record insistence for a cause that is not \r\njust a cause of the Americas but one espoused by the \r\npeoples and Governments of this world. I speak of the \r\nrejection of the economic embargo against our brother \r\nRepublic of Cuba — an anachronistic vestige of the \r\nCold War. The President of Estonia spoke earlier about \r\nthe anachronisms of the Cold War and the systems of \r\neconomic persecution used to impose political regimes \r\nand subjugate peoples. We are here on behalf of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela to confirm our support \r\nfor the 50-year struggle of the people and Government \r\nof Cuba against the criminal blockade. I ask President \r\nObama: When will you seize the opportunity to go \r\ndown in history by putting an end once and for all to the \r\ncriminal economic and trade embargo and persecution \r\nof our brother country of Cuba?\r\nWe also see new causes arise in the current \r\nstruggles facing our region. We have taken them on in \r\nunison. I wish here to recognize as a great step forward \r\nthe decision taken by the General Assembly two weeks \r\nago in support of the Argentine Republic and President \r\nCristina Fernández in her struggle against the financial \r\nplundering of the vulture funds. We want to support her \r\nin every way we can to ensure that the General Assembly, \r\nin accordance with the proposal of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and in as timely and efficient a manner as \r\npossible, drafts a high-quality document mandating the \r\ndefence of the nations represented by the Organization, \r\nespecially the poor countries of the developing world, \r\nagainst vulture funds that seek to plunder our economies \r\nand impose detrimental economic, institutional and \r\npolitical systems. We confirm the full solidarity of the \r\npeople of Venezuela with the people of Argentina, and \r\nindeed the solidarity of the CELAC countries. Let us \r\nmove towards this historic decision. We received 124 \r\nvotes in favour last week.\r\nAs we did at the CELAC summit in Havana, \r\nVenezuela also calls on the United Nations to support as \r\nclosely and warmly as it can and enforce the decisions \r\ncalling on the United States of America to enforce and \r\nexecute a decolonization plan for Puerto Rico. Puerto \r\nRico was invited to join CELAC because it is Caribbean \r\nand it is ours. We raise our voice to make it heard in this \r\nHall to call for the release of a man whose name many \r\nhere will hear for the first time. President Jacob Zuma \r\nof South Africa spoke of the great Madiba, Nelson \r\nMandela, who was forgotten for many years, despite \r\nthe fact that many now claim him as a representative \r\nof their causes. That is fine. Nelson Mandela represents \r\nthe human capacity of resilience and resistance enjoyed \r\nby people as they seek to achieve the objectives of \r\njustice and peace.\r\nThat is why I raise the name of a man who almost \r\n35 years ago was imprisoned and has been subjected \r\nto torture — a man with a family, a man from Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, a man like us. We are \r\ntalking about the Puerto Rican Oscar López Rivera, the \r\nlongest-held political prisoner who remains in a United \r\nStates prison to this day. We demand his immediate \r\nrelease. His only sin was to fight for independence and \r\nto defend the beautiful f lag and star of the dignity of \r\nour sister country of Puerto Rico. These are the causes \r\nof this historic moment.\r\n18/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nVenezuela is in the midst of a people’s democratic \r\nrevolution that began with an unimpeachable \r\nconstitutional event. For the first time in the history \r\nof our country, the Constitution of the Republic was \r\ndebated by the people and approved by a referendum \r\nwith the participation of the sovereign vote of the \r\npeople of Venezuela in 1999. Since then, we have been \r\ndeveloping and carrying out a process of political and \r\nsocial liberation.\r\nWe are trying to overcome poverty. In 2015, we \r\nwill have the post-2015 development agenda and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) will be over. \r\nThrough great effort, the Bolivarian Venezuela led \r\nby our Commander Hugo Chávez, was fortunately \r\nable achieve practically all the MDGs. We have an \r\nenrolment rate of more than 90 per cent in almost all \r\nschools, and we offer free, quality education from basic \r\nschools through to universities. We have lowered the \r\nunemployment rate from 20 per cent five years ago to \r\n5.5 per cent at the end of last year. We have changed \r\nthe curves. We had vulnerable employment to the \r\ntune of 60 per cent; now, 60 per cent of those jobs are \r\nprotected by social security, and are remunerated at a \r\nfair, regulated rate.\r\nI could spend hours here talking of the progress we \r\nhave made towards the MDGs. We have been able to \r\nsalvage our oil wealth. I am sure Members will know \r\nthat we have the largest oil reserves on the planet in \r\nthe beautiful Orinoco basin, and we have the largest oil \r\nfields there. For the first time in 90 years, we recovered \r\nfull control over our own petroleum resources as the \r\nanchor for our economic and social development. \r\nVenezuela has had to suffer ongoing harassment and \r\npersecution at the hands of the imperial forces and the \r\nallies of the United States empire, who have sought \r\nagain and again to undermine our democracy. One such \r\nattempt was the attempted coup against Hugo Chávez. \r\nFollowing his death on 5 March 2013, those forces \r\nresumed their activities to undermine our country. I \r\nthank the Governments of the world for their solidarity \r\nwith Venezuela, which has been struggling and \r\nresisting. They could not prevail against Hugo Chávez \r\nand they cannot prevail against us. We are still on the \r\npath towards revolution, democracy, independence and \r\ndignity, with our own voice speaking to the world.\r\nThere are major problems that we now have \r\nto address at this point. As members well know, \r\none such problem — perhaps the greatest threat of \r\nall — is the virus that causes Ebola haemorrhagic fever. \r\nIf this world and our United Nations system had been \r\nsomewhat more humane, we would have focused on \r\nlending our support to tackling this real threat instead \r\nof sending drones, missiles and bombs to destroy the \r\npeople of Gaza or to bomb the people of Iraq and Syria. \r\nThe President of Chad announced that his country had \r\ndecided to donate $2 million to the Ebola fund. The \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela is going to be giving \r\n$5 million to the fund to support Africa and the needy \r\npeople of the world.\r\nLet us be clear. We should be discussing the \r\nscientific reports here and taking decisions based \r\non those reports. We should be focused on another \r\nimportant issue affecting the survival of humankind on \r\nthis Earth — climate change. A poem of the indigenous \r\npeoples of the Americas, which was read out yesterday, \r\nsays that after they can no longer poison the rivers, \r\nafter they have poisoned our lakes, once there is not \r\neven one fish left to eat, then the powerful of the \r\nworld will have to eat each other. They want to create \r\nextraneous formulas when all they need to do is to make \r\nan extraordinary effort and recognize climate change \r\nas a climatic emergency. We should not just make \r\nspeeches and vague offers; we must restore sanity to \r\nthe Organization if we are to strengthen it, and place at \r\nthe forefront of our agenda the real common problems \r\nfacing us.\r\nToday in the Security Council, they adopted a \r\nseries of decisions in a bid to combat terrorism. Let \r\nus be clear: we must combat terrorism. The Bolivarian \r\nAlliance for the Peoples of Our America has been \r\ncondemning terrorism for more than a year and a \r\nhalf. We are deeply pained by the murder of Western \r\njournalists and the dastardly acts of these terrorists, but \r\na year and a half ago when boys and girls were captured \r\nby these terrorist and other groups in Syria, we were not \r\nthat pained at that time. They were beheading women \r\nin mosques. The pain should be the same.\r\nShould our pain be greater depending on the colour \r\nor origin of the skin of a person or the origin of that \r\nperson? The loss of human lives should pain us all, and \r\nwe therefore condemn the terrorist attack perpetrated \r\nby NATO and its allies to change the regime in Syria. \r\nI am here to say, with force of truth, on behalf of the \r\nBolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \r\nand my Government, that if the Government of Syria \r\nhad been overthrown by those imperial attacks, today \r\nin that entire region of Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Jordan \r\nwe would see the power of those terrorists take root.\r\n14-54835 19/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nAs painful as it may be, we have to say that President \r\nBashar Al-Assad and the democratic and constitutional \r\nGovernment of Syria has always combated terrorism \r\nand has suffered thousands of deaths. We believe that \r\ninstead of the continual, demented bombing, must \r\nstrike a great alliance of peace against terrorism, \r\nrespecting the sovereignty of countries and sovereign \r\nGovernments throughout that region. I would ask the \r\ndelegation of the United States take note of this message \r\nand convey it to President Obama.\r\nOnly an alliance that respects the sovereignty \r\nof those nations, along with the cooperation of \r\ntheir Governments, peoples and armed forces, will \r\noverthrow the Islamic State and the terrorist forces \r\nadvancing like monster against the West. There is no \r\nother way to overthrow them — certainly not with \r\nbombs that kill mostly the innocent. They never kill the \r\narmed forces; they always kill the innocent. After so \r\nmuch death and bombing of the brotherly Arab people \r\nof Iraq, we have to invite the sovereign Governments \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, \r\nJordan and Egypt and indeed the entire region to come \r\nup with a comprehensive political, military, cultural \r\nand communication strategy that can be supported by \r\nthe Security Council. Anything else is crazy.\r\nLet us consider what happened in Libya, as noted \r\nby the President of Chad. It only fomented hatred and \r\nan anti-Al-Qadhafi front. What is happening in Libya? \r\nIt has become a territory for trafficking in arms and \r\nexplosives by terrorist groups fighting for scraps of \r\nterritory. We have seen the end of the beautiful history \r\nof the people of our brother country of Libya. It is a \r\ncrazy race towards more violence and terrorism. A \r\nmore dangerous world has emerged from the demented \r\nwork of those who lead and make decisions in the \r\nOrganization.\r\nWe humbly lend our voice and our proposal to the \r\ntable, and we do so with genuine love. That is how we \r\nshow our solidarity with the people of Palestine. We in \r\nthe Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America \r\nwill continue to show our solidarity with them. \r\nVenezuela, as Members know, has opened a modest \r\nair-bridge to provide logistical support, food, blankets \r\nand medicines in support of the people of Palestine who \r\nrecently suffered a brutal attack. We want peace, total \r\npeace. Our Organization needs to be overhauled so that \r\neveryone can enjoy total peace. It is not through the \r\nthreat of the use of force, or the use of force, or internal \r\ncompetition to overthrow Governments such as the \r\none that I lead, that we will have stable peace. No, it \r\nis respect for international law that will lead to stable \r\npeace and full security.\r\nLastly, I wish to thank the General Assembly for \r\nits support. Next year, 2015, Venezuela, with members’ \r\nsupport, will assume leadership of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement for the next three years. We humbly aspire \r\nto play a genuine role in mobilizing and revitalizing the \r\nentire process of United Nations reform. The process \r\nmust include the elaboration of an agenda of world \r\npriorities in which we will all have a voice and a vote, \r\nand no one can impose their will on the others. Next \r\nyear, delegations from throughout the world will be \r\nwelcome at the historic Summit of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement in Caracas.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by The Right Honourable David \r\nCameron, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nThe Right Honourable David Cameron, Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency, David Cameron, Prime \r\nMinister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Cameron (United Kingdom): This year we \r\nface extraordinary tests of our values and our resolve. \r\nIn responding to the aggression against one of our \r\nMember States, Ukraine; in seeking peace in the Middle \r\nEast; in dealing with the terrifying spread of the Ebola \r\nvirus in West Africa; and in overcoming what I want to \r\nfocus on today, which is the mortal threat we all face \r\n20/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nfrom the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \r\n(ISIL) in Syria and Iraq. Deir ez-Zor is a province in \r\neastern Syria. Home to the Al-Sheitaat tribe it was \r\ncaptured by ISIL last month. Seven hundred tribesmen \r\nwere executed; many were beheaded. The vast majority \r\nwere civilians, Muslims who refused to take an oath of \r\nallegiance to ISIL’s sick extremist world view and who \r\npaid for this with their lives. They are not alone. Across \r\nSyria and northern Iraq thousands have suffered the \r\nsame fate — Muslims, both Sunni and Shia; Christians; \r\nYazidis; people of every faith and none.\r\nISIL is not a problem restricted to just one region. It \r\nhas murderous plans to expand its borders well beyond \r\nIraq and Syria and to carry out terrorist atrocities right \r\nacross the world. It is recruiting new fighters from all \r\nover the world. Five hundred have gone there from \r\nmy country, Britain, and one of them almost certainly \r\nbrutally murdered two American journalists and a \r\nBritish aid worker. This is a problem that affects us all \r\nand we must tackle it together.\r\nThere is not one person in this Hall who will view \r\nthis challenge without reference to the past, whether in \r\nIraq or in Afghanistan. Of course it is absolutely right \r\nthat we should learn the lessons of the past, especially \r\nwhat happened in Iraq a decade ago. But we have to \r\nlearn the right lessons — yes to careful preparation; \r\nno to rushing to join a conflict without a clear plan. \r\nBut we must not be so frozen with fear that we do not \r\ndo anything at all. Isolation and withdrawing from a \r\nproblem like ISIL will only make matters worse.\r\nWe must not allow past mistakes to become an \r\nexcuse for indifference or inaction. The right lesson is \r\nthat we should act, but act differently. We should be \r\ncomprehensive, defeating the ideology of extremism \r\nthat is the root cause of this terrorism, so that we win the \r\nbattle of ideas and not just the battle of military might. \r\nWe should be intelligent, supporting representative and \r\naccountable Governments and working with them at \r\ntheir request, not going in over their heads. We should \r\nbe inclusive, working with partners in the region who \r\nare prepared to be part of the solution, potentially \r\nincluding Iran. We should be uncompromising, using \r\nall the means at our disposal, including military force, \r\nto hunt down these extremists. Let me take each of \r\nthese in turn.\r\nThe root cause of this terrorist threat is a poisonous \r\nideology of Islamist extremism. This has nothing \r\nto do with Islam, which is a peaceful religion that \r\ninspires countless acts of generosity every day. Islamist \r\nextremism on the other hand believes in using the most \r\nbrutal forms of terrorism to force people to accept a \r\nwarped world view and to live in a quasi-mediaeval \r\nstate. To defeat ISIL, and organizations like it, we must \r\ndefeat this ideology in all its forms.\r\nAs evidence emerges about the backgrounds of \r\nthose convicted of terrorist offences, it is clear that \r\nmany of them were initially influenced by preachers \r\nwho claim not to encourage violence but whose world \r\nview can be used as a justification for it. We know \r\nthis world view. The peddling of lies — that 9/11 was \r\nsomehow a Jewish plot, or that the 7/7 London attacks \r\nwere staged; the idea that Muslims are persecuted all \r\nover the world as a deliberate act of Western policy; and \r\nthe concept of an inevitable clash of civilizations.\r\nWe must be clear. To defeat the ideology of \r\nextremism we need to deal with all forms of extremism, \r\nnot just violent extremism. For governments there \r\nare some obvious ways we can do this. We must ban \r\npreachers of hate from coming to our countries. We must \r\nproscribe organizations that incite terrorism against \r\npeople at home and abroad. We must work together \r\nto take down illegal online material like the recent \r\nvideos of ISIL murdering hostages. We must stop the \r\nso-called non-violent extremists from inciting hatred \r\nand intolerance in our schools, universities and even \r\nour prisons. Of course, some will argue that this is not \r\ncompatible with free speech and intellectual inquiry. \r\nBut I ask “Would we sit back and allow right-wing \r\nextremists, Nazis or Ku Klux Klansmen to recruit on \r\nour university campuses?” No, so we should not stand \r\nby and just allow any form of non-violent extremism.\r\nWe need to argue that prophecies of a global war \r\nof religion pitting Muslims against the rest of the world \r\nare nonsense. We need Muslims and their Governments \r\nthroughout the world to reclaim their religion from \r\nthese sick terrorists as so many are doing, and quite \r\nrightly doing, today. We all need to help them with \r\nprogrammes that channel young people away from \r\nthese poisonous ideologues, and we need the strongest \r\npossible international focus on tackling this ideology, \r\nwhich is why here at the United Nations the United \r\nKingdom is calling for a new Special Representative \r\non extremism.\r\nBut fighting extremism will never be enough. \r\nCommunism was defeated not simply by pointing out its \r\nf laws, but by showing that the alternative of economic \r\nfreedoms, democracy and the rule of law could build a \r\nbetter society and a better world. Young people need \r\n14-54835 21/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nto see the power of a different, better, more open, \r\nmore democratic path. The twentieth century taught \r\nus the vital role of representative and accountable \r\nGovernments in offering their people opportunity, hope \r\nand dignity.\r\nOf course we should not be naïve. Not every \r\ncountry can move at the same speed or even reach the \r\nsame destination. We should respect different cultures, \r\ntraditions and histories. But let us be clear — the failure \r\nto meet people’s aspirations can create a breeding \r\nground where extremist and even terrorist insurgency \r\ncan take root. Governments that only govern for some \r\nof their people cause deep resentment. In Iraq, the \r\nfailure of the Al-Maliki Government to represent all of \r\nthe people has driven some of them into the arms of the \r\nextremists.\r\nToo often, people have been faced with a false choice \r\nbetween an autocratic and unrepresentative government \r\non the one hand and a brutal insurgency, with religion \r\nmisused as its rallying call, on the other. To combat this \r\nwe must support the building blocks of free and open \r\nsocieties. In Iraq this means supporting the creation of \r\na new and genuinely inclusive Government capable of \r\nuniting all Iraqis — Sunnis, Shia, Kurd, Christians and \r\nothers. In Syria, it must mean a political transition and \r\nan end to Al-Assad’s brutality.\r\nI know there are some who think that we should \r\ndo a deal with Al-Assad in order to defeat ISIL. But I \r\nthink this view is dangerously misguided. Our enemies’ \r\nenemy is not our friend; it is another enemy. Doing a \r\ndeal with Al-Assad will not defeat ISIL because the \r\nbias and the brutality of the Al-Assad regime were and \r\nare one of the most powerful recruiting tools for the \r\nextremists. Syria needs what Iraq needs — an inclusive, \r\nrepresentative, democratic Government that can look \r\nafter the interests of all its peoples.\r\nTo those who have backed Al-Assad or who have \r\nstood on the sidelines, I would say this: “We are ready \r\nto join with you in a new political effort to secure \r\na representative and accountable Government in \r\nDamascus that can take the fight to ISIL”. It is simply \r\nnot credible for Al-Assad to lead such a government \r\nalthough we are prepared to look at every practical \r\noption to find a way forward.\r\nWe must be inclusive, engaging the widest possible \r\ncoalition of countries in this international effort. ISIL is \r\na threat to us all, but the greatest threat is to the region. \r\nIt is very welcome that a number of Arab countries \r\nhave already taken part in the action to degrade ISIL. \r\nThey have shown courage and leadership. Iran should \r\nalso be given the chance to show it can be part of the \r\nsolution, not part of the problem. Earlier today I met \r\nwith President Rouhani. We have severe disagreements. \r\nIran’s support for terrorist organizations, its nuclear \r\nprogramme, and its treatment of its people all need to \r\nchange. But Iran’s leaders could help in defeating the \r\nthreat from ISIL. They could help to secure a more \r\nstable, inclusive Iraq, and a more stable and inclusive \r\nSyria. If they are prepared to do this, we should \r\nwelcome their engagement.\r\nFinally, when the safety and security of our \r\npeople are at stake, we must be uncompromising in \r\nour response. That starts at home. For our part, in \r\nthe United Kingdom we are introducing new powers \r\nto strengthen our ability to seize passports and stop \r\nsuspects from travelling; to allow us to strip British \r\nidentity from dual nationals and temporarily prevent \r\nsome British nationals getting back into our country; \r\nto ensure that airlines comply with our no f ly lists \r\nand security screening requirements; and to enable \r\nour police and security services to apply for stronger \r\nlocational constraints on those in the United Kingdom \r\nwho pose a risk. Here at the United Nations we have \r\nled in the adoption of a Security Council resolution to \r\ndisrupt the f lows of finance to ISIL, to sanction those \r\nwho are seeking to recruit to ISIL and to encourage \r\ncountries to do all they can to prevent foreign fighters \r\njoining the extremist cause.\r\nWhat about the role of our military? I do not believe \r\nthat the treat of Islamist extremism will best be solved \r\nby Western ground troops directly trying to pacify or \r\nreconstruct Middle Eastern or African countries. But, \r\npursuing an intelligent and comprehensive approach \r\nshould include a place for our military. Our military \r\ncan support the enormous humanitarian efforts that \r\nare necessary, as our Royal Air Force did in helping \r\nthe millions of people who fled from ISIL. We should, \r\ntogether, do more to build the capability of the legitimate \r\nauthorities that are fighting the extremists. That can \r\nmean training, equipping and advising, and providing \r\ntechnology and the other assets necessary for success. \r\nWhether it is supporting action against Boko Haram in \r\nNigeria, against Al-Shabaab in Somalia, against Ansar \r\nal-Sharia in Libya, or against Al-Qaida in Yemen, it is \r\nright to help those who are fighting on the front line for \r\ntheir societies, their countries and their freedom.\r\n22/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nAlong with our European partners, we have already \r\nbeen supplying equipment directly to Kurdish forces. \r\nWe are strengthening the resilience of the military \r\nforces in neighbouring Lebanon and Jordan, and \r\nBritish Tornado and surveillance aircraft have already \r\nbeen helping with intelligence gathering and logistics \r\nsupport to help those taking on ISIL in Iraq.\r\nWe now have a substantial international coalition in \r\nplace, including Arab nations, committed to confronting \r\nand defeating ISIL. We have a comprehensive strategy \r\nto do that, with the political, diplomatic, humanitarian \r\nand military components that are needed to succeed \r\nover time. The Security Council has now received a \r\nclear request from the Iraqi Government to support it \r\nin its military action against ISIL. So we have a clear \r\nbasis in international law for action, and we have a need \r\nto act in our own national interest to protect our people \r\nand our society. It is right that Britain should now move \r\nto a new phase of action. I am therefore recalling the \r\nBritish Parliament on Friday to secure approval for the \r\nUnited Kingdom to take part in international air strikes \r\nagainst ISIL in Iraq.\r\nMy message today is simple. We are facing an evil \r\nagainst which the whole world should unite. As ever, in \r\nthe cause of freedom, democracy and justice, Britain \r\nwill play its part.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. David Cameron, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Prime \r\nMinister of Denmark\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Denmark.\r\nMs. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Prime Minister of \r\nDenmark, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Helle Thorning-\r\nSchmidt, Prime Minister of Denmark, and inviting her \r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Thorning-Schmidt (Denmark): Despite our \r\naspirations to create a more just and peaceful world, \r\natrocities continue to take place. Every day we witness \r\nexpressions of the darker side of human nature: \r\nthousands of innocent civilians besieged on a mountain \r\nin northern Iraq by heavily armed extremists; a Syrian \r\ndictator who bombs and starves his own people, \r\nleaving more than 10 million people in need of urgent \r\nhumanitarian assistance; the persecution of people \r\nbecause of their religious or political beliefs, their \r\ngender or sexual orientation; disrespect for national \r\nborders, challenging the basic principles on which our \r\nrules-based international order is built; climate change \r\ncausing great risks to human health, global food security \r\nand economic development and to the natural resources \r\non which so much of our prosperity depends; and a \r\nworld of more than 7 billion people with an increasing \r\ndemand for key resources and an unsustainable pattern \r\nof consumption and production.\r\nThe challenges we face are complex. There are \r\nno simple solutions. What is required of us is strong, \r\ncollective international action, not only to manage \r\nthe crises and conflicts of today but to prevent the \r\ncrises and conflicts of tomorrow. I am a true believer \r\nin international cooperation and in the virtues of the \r\nUnited Nations, but as the world changes and we are \r\nfaced with new challenges, we must find new ways to \r\nadapt.\r\nMr. Dabbashi (Libya), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nI am also confident that we will adapt, but only if \r\nwe have a strong United Nations, and only if we act \r\ntogether. As Member States each one of us must fulfil \r\nour obligations under the Charter. That is our common \r\ncommitment and our shared responsibility. I see three \r\nchallenges where we, the United Nations, should act \r\nand should act now. Urgency is key.\r\nFirst, we need stronger international cooperation \r\nand action on peace and security. Secondly, we have to \r\nreach an ambitious international agreement on climate \r\nchange next year in Paris. Thirdly, we have to agree on \r\nthe post-2015 agenda for sustainable development.\r\nOf the three challenges, the first is international \r\npeace and security. This past year, we have seen the \r\nrise of a violent and intensifying conflict fuelled by \r\nextremism, in particular the horrific and brutal terrorist \r\norganization, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \r\n(ISIL). ISIL represents a distorted political ideology \r\nthat must be confronted, degraded and defeated by the \r\nentire international community, including, of course, \r\ncountries in the region. As we are gathered this week, \r\n14-54835 23/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nthe States Members of the United Nations are sending a \r\nclear message that we utterly condemn ISIL’s cowardly \r\nacts of terror and that we are unified in our firm \r\nresolve to oppose and confront its violent and extremist \r\nideology. Let it be clear that we are determined to \r\nsupport the Iraqi Government in protecting its people.\r\nDenmark will stand up for our common values as \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter, and Denmark \r\nwill support the victims of ISIL’S atrocities. We are \r\ntaking part in the humanitarian relief efforts in northern \r\nIraq, and we will continue our active contribution to the \r\ninternational efforts to support Iraq in the fight against \r\nISIL. To stop the advance of ISIL, it is imperative to end \r\nthe f low of foreign fighters and financing from outside. \r\nThat indeed is a common obligation. It is also critical \r\nthat we address the root causes of violent extremism \r\nand improve the conditions in Syria that ISIL has been \r\nable to exploit.\r\nThe humanitarian situation in Syria continues to be \r\nof great concern. Though progress is difficult, we must \r\nspare no effort to seek a political solution leading to a \r\ntransition from the current regime. There will always \r\nbe a risk that political transition will be exploited by \r\nviolent extremists. Still, history shows that democratic \r\nand inclusive Governments, open societies and a \r\nfundamental respect for human rights remain the only \r\nviable path towards stability, security and prosperity \r\nfor our citizens.\r\nBringing an end to the violence in the region will \r\nrequire a sustained and comprehensive contribution \r\nfrom every one of us. The successful removal of \r\nAl-Assad’s chemical weapons clearly demonstrated \r\nwhat can be achieved when we join forces in decisive \r\ninternational action. A coalition of Denmark, Norway, \r\nRussia, China, Finland, the United Kingdom and the \r\nUnited States effectively secured and destroyed those \r\nhorrendous weapons of war.\r\nOur united response is also required against another \r\ngrowing threat. The Ebola epidemic has become a severe \r\nhumanitarian, social and economic crisis for countries \r\nin West Africa. If we fail to act now, it may develop into \r\na global health crisis, impacting millions of people. If \r\nso, we will not only be confronted with a health crisis \r\nbut also with a threat to international peace, prosperity \r\nand security. It is very clear that this challenge cannot \r\nbe tackled by any one nation alone. That is why we \r\nmust all lend our support. The United Nations and its \r\nMember States have a common responsibility to bring \r\nEbola under control.\r\nEbola is not just a regional challenge; it has now \r\nbecome a global crisis. Denmark is committed to that \r\ncause. We have already contributed to the international \r\nresponse, including the United Nations humanitarian air \r\nservice, and we will now increase our support. Today, \r\nI can announce that Denmark will provide a maritime \r\ntransport capacity to the United Nations. With that, \r\nwe will support the construction of needed housing \r\nfacilities for the international health personnel in the \r\naffected areas. We will provide additional funding to \r\nthe World Health Organization. As the situation evolves, \r\nwe will stand ready to consider additional steps.\r\nThe global community is based on international law. \r\nThat law must be respected and not blatantly violated, as \r\nwe have seen done in the past year. We have witnessed \r\nan unacceptable foreign intervention in Ukraine. \r\nFundamental principles of national sovereignty and \r\nnon-interference have been disrespected. The recent \r\nceasefire is an important step on the only viable way \r\nforward, namely, a political solution. Yet, we have \r\nto see Russia’s commitment to a political solution \r\ndemonstrated in action, not only in words. Throughout \r\nthe conflict Russia’s self-proclaimed support to the \r\npeace process has been in stark contrast to realities on \r\nthe ground.\r\nWe remain fully committed to a political solution \r\nthat respects Ukraine’s territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty. Respect for international law and human \r\nrights should always be at the very core of peace \r\nand development, as should the rule of law and good \r\ngovernance. That is why Denmark strongly supports \r\nbold and significant new steps in the United Nations, \r\nsuch as the Secretary-General’s recent Rights Up Front \r\ninitiative.\r\nThis year also marks the thirtieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the United Nations Convention against \r\nTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading \r\nTreatment or Punishment. Together with Chile, Ghana, \r\nIndonesia and Morocco, Denmark has launched a \r\nlong-term initiative for the universal ratification and \r\nimplementation of that Convention. We have made \r\nsignificant progress, but we also need to do more to \r\nprotect men and women in all parts of the world from \r\ntorture and ill-treatment.\r\nMy second point is about the need to advance our \r\ncollective answer to the challenges posed by climate \r\nchange. Earlier this year I had the privilege, together \r\nwith the Premier of Greenland, of hosting a visit by \r\nthe Secretary-General to Greenland. We travelled \r\n24/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\ntogether by dog sleigh on the receding ice, and we \r\nheard the stories told by the local population about how \r\nthe changes are affecting local livelihoods. Climate \r\nchange is painfully visible in the Arctic. That is beyond \r\ndiscussion. Let there be no illusion that climate change \r\nwill have only regional impacts. The changes will affect \r\neach and every one of us on this planet. That is why \r\nambitious action is required of us now. One crucial step \r\nwould be a binding global agreement to reduce carbon \r\ndioxide emissions in Paris next year.\r\nSince 2010, Denmark has dedicated $350 million \r\nto climate action. This year alone, we will commit \r\nmore than $100 million. But Governments cannot do \r\nthis alone. We need to engage the private sector and \r\nother partners to commit to action and ensure adequate \r\nclimate finance and foster innovation and green \r\nsolutions. Some still might fear that the green transition \r\nwill limit economic growth. That is not necessarily \r\nso. For example, the Danish economy has grown \r\nby 40 per cent since 1990, while our total emissions \r\nhave decreased by 20 per cent in that same period. In \r\nother words, it is possible to de-link economic growth \r\nfrom increased emissions. At the Secretary-General’s \r\nClimate Summit yesterday, world leaders expressed \r\ntheir commitment to address those issues. Now is the \r\ntime to deliver on that commitment.\r\nThe third and final area where Denmark sees an \r\nurgent need for action is on the post-2015 agenda for \r\nsustainable development. As stated by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral: “Ours is the first generation that can wipe \r\npoverty from the face of the Earth” (A/68/PV.5, p. 1). \r\nThat is not a message based on wishful thinking. It \r\nis based on the facts. It is within our reach and it has \r\nto be done. Over a 20-year period, from 1990-2010, \r\n700 million people have been lifted out of extreme \r\npoverty. Child mortality has been reduced by almost \r\n50 per cent. Ninety per cent of children in developing \r\nregions now attend primary schools. That represents \r\ntruly historic progress. But still we need to do more.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals were \r\nformulated almost 15 years ago, and the world has, as \r\nwe know, developed rapidly since. Clearly, the new \r\nset of sustainable development goals must address \r\nand integrate the economic, social, and environmental \r\ndimensions of development.\r\nAnother important factor is to ensure women’s \r\nempowerment, gender equality and the rights of women \r\nand girls. That includes sexual and reproductive health \r\nrights. In too many places those fundamental rights are \r\nstill not observed. Women and young girls must have \r\nthe right to decide freely whether they want to have \r\nchildren, when, how many, and with whom.\r\nAll young people must have access to proper \r\neducation. Two hundred years ago, compulsory \r\neducation was introduced in my country. Education for \r\nthe many and not just for the few has been a primary \r\ndriver in transforming Denmark into a democratic and \r\nprosperous nation. Education has also been a driver of \r\ngender equality, and still is. That is one aspect of the \r\npost-2015 agenda that is particularly close to my heart. \r\nI have been very proud to be one of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Champions for his Global Education First \r\nInitiative. One of our key priorities must be to ensure \r\nquality education also for the most disadvantaged \r\ngroups and in the most vulnerable countries.\r\nAs we look at the global landscape today, insecurity \r\nis sadly on the rise. We all know who is paying the \r\nhighest price. Today for the first time since the Second \r\nWorld War, more than 50 million people throughout \r\nthe world have been displaced owing to conflict and \r\nviolence. Far too many of those people are children.\r\nWe need a United Nations that can help mediate, \r\nprevent and resolve armed conflicts and promote \r\nuniversal respect for human rights. We need a United \r\nNations that is committed to act against climate change. \r\nAnd we need a United Nations that can help deliver \r\nsustainable development for all and provide effective \r\nassistance to countries suffering from the Ebola virus.\r\nBut the United Nations can do nothing without the \r\ncollective political will of all of us, its Member States. \r\nThe world needs a United Nations that adapts to new \r\nchallenges and reflects the changing global political \r\nrealities. Denmark supports a reformed Security Council \r\nthat fulfils its primary purpose and responsibility when \r\npeace and security is threatened. We need a United \r\nNations based on the strong values and obligations \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter. More than \r\never, we need a United Nations that acts.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Denmark for the statement she has just \r\nmade.\r\nMs. Helle Thorning-Schmidt, Prime Minister of \r\nDenmark, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n14-54835 25/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nAddress by Mr. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Prime \r\nMinister of Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Prime Minister of Ukraine, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Arseniy \r\nYatsenyuk, Prime Minister of Ukraine, and inviting \r\nhim to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Yatsenyuk (Ukraine): Ukraine, as a co-founder \r\nof the United Nations, knows why we established this \r\nOrganization — for peace and stability. Do we have \r\nthis peace and stability? No, and yet our global aim and \r\nglobal target is to do everything we can to protect our \r\ncitizens and to deliver peace to our nations. The global \r\nagenda today consists of a number of things. Everyone \r\nhas mentioned the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, \r\neveryone has mentioned Ebola, and everyone has \r\nmentioned Ukraine. Frankly speaking I would be happy \r\nnot to be in this situation, but we are a country that \r\nknows what terrorism means, and not in words but in \r\ndeeds, in practice.\r\nLet me remind Members of the origin of the conflict \r\nthat is evolving in Ukraine. Is it a domestic conflict? \r\nNo. It is true that my country has some internal \r\ndifferences, but every country has differences and we \r\nare ready to handle and tackle those differences inside \r\nour country. The origin of the conflict is an invasion \r\nby the Russian Federation. A permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council has violated the United Nations \r\nCharter, which is absolutely and entirely unacceptable \r\nbehaviour, especially on the part of a permanent \r\nmember of the Council. It would be better for Russia to \r\nbe an “insecurity” member rather than a security one.\r\nTwenty years ago, Ukraine abandoned its nuclear \r\nweapons. We possessed the third-biggest arsenal in \r\nthe world. When we agreed to relinquish our nuclear \r\npower arsenal in Budapest, Ukraine got guarantees \r\nof territorial integrity and sovereignty. Russia was a \r\nco-signer of and co-contributor to that memorandum. \r\nInstead of security guarantees, 20 years later we \r\nreceived Russian military boots on Ukrainian soil. It \r\nseems that it is difficult to convince another country \r\nto stop nuclear proliferation. We are committed to our \r\nnuclear non-proliferation programme, but we need \r\nto have valid guarantees of our territorial integrity, \r\nsecurity and independence.\r\nA few months ago, the Russian Federation \r\nannexed Crimea. One country, which is a Member \r\nState of the United Nations and a permanent member \r\nof the Security Council, a country that is armed to the \r\nteeth, just decided to grab the land of its neighbour, \r\nindependent Ukraine. Let me commend the efforts of \r\nUnited Nations Member States that overwhelmingly \r\nsupported the resolution supporting Ukraine’s \r\nterritorial integrity and condemning the illegal \r\nannexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation. They \r\nmoved further. For today we can state that Russian \r\ntroops are deployed in the east of Ukraine. The Russian \r\nFederation violated a number of bilateral and \r\nmultilateral international agreements, starting with the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and ending with the resolutions \r\non counter-terrorism that were adopted at the United \r\nNations.\r\nWe know what terrorism means, and we urge Russia \r\nto pull back its forces, to pull back its artillery, to stop \r\nsupplying Russian-led terrorists, to restore control over \r\nthe Ukrainian-Russian border, and to start real talks, \r\npeace talks. We are the country that needs peace. It is \r\ndifficult to hammer out any kind of peace deal at the \r\nbarrel of a gun made in Russia.\r\nLet me remind members of a tragedy that happened \r\nbecause of the Russian invasion. A few months ago, a \r\ncivilian aircraft, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17, was \r\ndowned by a Russian-made surface-to-air missile, and \r\n298 innocent civilians were killed. Ukraine mourns the \r\nvictims. We pray together with the families from the \r\nNetherlands, Australia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, \r\nIndonesia, the Philippines and Germany. Ukraine \r\nhanded over the investigation to an independent body \r\nwhich is Dutch-led. We urge everyone to help us to \r\nbring to justice those responsible for this despicable \r\ncrime, a crime against humanity.\r\nEvery day, despite the ceasefire, we are losing \r\nUkrainian soldiers and civilians, and the shelling \r\nis still going on. I reiterate once again that we need \r\npeace. What is the formula for this peace? The military \r\noption is definitely not the best option. It has to be a \r\ncomprehensive approach which comprises diplomatic, \r\nfinancial, political and, only at the last, military options.\r\nThe United States and the European Union \r\nimposed a number of sanctions against Russia. We do \r\nunderstand that sanctions are the way to start real talks \r\n26/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nand to hammer out a peace deal. We have no trust in \r\nwords. We have trust only in deeds and actions. Once \r\nagain we reiterate our commitment to restore law and \r\norder. We urge the Russian Federation to stick to its \r\ninternational obligation to execute everything that was \r\nwritten in Minsk. This is not a menu where one can \r\npick the cherry. It means that Russia is to execute all \r\n12 points of this memorandum. We ask our partners not \r\nto lift sanctions until Ukraine takes over control of its \r\nentire territory, starting with the east of Ukraine and \r\nending with Crimea. Crimea was, is and will be a part \r\nof Ukraine.\r\nLet me end with a direct message to the Russian \r\nPresident. Mr. Putin can win the fight against the \r\ntroops, but he will never win the fight against a united \r\nUkrainian nation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Ukraine for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, Prime Minister of Ukraine, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Rashid Meredov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Turkmenistan.\r\nMr. Meredov (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nFirst, I have the honour to convey words of greeting \r\nand wishes of peace and prosperity to the Member \r\nStates and their people on behalf of the President of \r\nTurkmenistan, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow. I should \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election \r\nto the post of President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session and wish him success in his \r\nforthcoming responsibilities. I should also like to \r\nexpress my appreciation to Mr. John Ashe, President \r\nat the sixty-eighth session, for his skillful and effective \r\nwork in this post.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly \r\nis taking place against the background of difficult \r\nprocesses that we see in various regions of the world. \r\nAssessment of these processes and their causal \r\nrelationships may differ, but it is apparent that in view \r\nof prevailing conditions the world community needs to \r\napply balanced, sober and a highly responsible approach \r\nto emerging and potential challenges and threats.\r\nThe peaceful resolution of these conflicts must be \r\nachieved by diplomatic approaches. It is an objective \r\nand imperative requirement of our times. Experience \r\nonce again vividly demonstrates that there is no military \r\nsolution to the international and internal conflicts in \r\ntoday’s world. It is our firm conviction that the role of \r\nthe United Nations is acquiring decisive importance. \r\nThe United Nations must play the leading role in \r\nreconciling contradictions, preserving global stability, \r\nand strengthening peoples’ faith in international \r\ninstitutions and legal frameworks.\r\nThe Security Council is called on to assume a \r\nspecial responsibility. Its functions and authority \r\nunder the United Nations Charter cannot be questioned \r\nor used to satisfy some individual or group interest. \r\nThe Security Council is and must remain the only \r\nuniversal legitimate body for maintaining global peace \r\nand stability and safeguardingthe political and moral \r\nfoundations of the modern global architecture.\r\nTurkmenistan has unceasingly and consistently \r\nadvocated the expansion and maximum use of the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping potential. Today, the \r\nneed for this is especially relevant. Therefore, our \r\ncountry proposes to actively begin the development \r\nof common approaches with a view to reducing and, \r\nin future, completely eliminating all potential risks of \r\nconfrontation.\r\nAs the Assembly will recall, the President of \r\nTurkmenistan stated at the sixty-sixth session that it \r\nwas necessary to adopt a United Nations declaration \r\non the priority use of political and diplomatic means \r\nto solve international problems and their further \r\nconsideration at the General Assembly. We are ready \r\nto engage in meaningful and constructive discussions \r\nwith all interested parties on this issue.\r\nThe logic of the development of global processes in \r\nthe sphere of security dictates the need for fundamental \r\nstrengthening of regional cooperation mechanisms. \r\nFor Central Asia, such cooperation should ensure \r\nfavourable conditions for preserving and maintaining \r\nlasting peace and stability and for successful responses \r\nto terrorist threats, extremism, organized crime and \r\ndrug trafficking.\r\nIn this connection, we consider it relevant to create \r\na standing mechanism of political consultations to \r\ncoordinate steps aimed at maintaining security in this \r\narea, as well as preventing and neutralizing conflict \r\nsituations and combating new threats. We propose that \r\nserious consideration be given to the idea of convening \r\na forum on security and cooperation in Central Asia \r\n14-54835 27/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations as a starting \r\nplatform for further work in this area.\r\nWe stand ready to host such a forum in 2015 in \r\nTurkmenistan’s capital, Ashgabat. As the host country \r\nof the United Nations Regional Centre for Preventive \r\nDiplomacy for Central Asia, Turkmenistan advocates \r\nmultilateral support for its work, which has proven to \r\nbe highly effective. It is not by chance that in August \r\n2012 the United Nations Security Council emphasized \r\nthe great importance of preventive diplomacy and \r\nearly settlement of disputes and in this connection \r\nsupported the efforts of the United Nations Regional \r\nCentre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia. We \r\nare convinced that in the context of current and future \r\ndevelopments of political, economic, environmental \r\nand humanitarian processes in the Central Asian region \r\nand neighbouring areas, the mandate of the Centre will \r\nbe especially relevant and necessary. We therefore call \r\nfor more active involvement of that Centre in various \r\naspects of regional problems with the support of \r\nMember States.\r\nTurkmenistan also believes that it is essential to \r\nestablish a more focused and substantive interaction \r\nbetween the Regional Centre and international \r\norganizations, including the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, the Commonwealth \r\nof Independent States, and other bodies, with a view \r\nto elaborating common approaches to such current \r\nissues as transnational threats, terrorism, illegal drug \r\ntrafficking, environmental challenges, management of \r\ntransboundary water and energy resources, and regional \r\nsecurity in the context of the situation in Afghanistan.\r\nIn speaking of this, I wish to underline that the \r\nsettlement of the situation in Afghanistan is a key \r\nfactor in achieving regional peace and stability. It is \r\nessential to support the positive processes that are \r\ntaking place in this country and to provide the Afghan \r\npeople with real assistance in achieving reconciliation \r\nand accord. That can be achieved only through peaceful \r\nnegotiation. There are no other options here.\r\nAs a neutral country and Afghanistan’s immediate \r\nneighbour, Turkmenistan offered its political space for \r\nthe organization of a broad-based inter-Afghan national \r\ndialogue under the auspices and active involvement of \r\nthe United Nations. We already have joint experience \r\nin conducting negotiations in such a format. We believe \r\nthat it could be used today as well. Such dialogue, \r\nin addition to purely political aspects, implies the \r\ndiscussion of a full set of measures aimed at providing \r\nspecific economic support to Afghanistan and the \r\ninvolvement of that country in regional integration \r\nprocesses and future infrastructure projects.\r\nFor many years Turkmenistan has provided \r\nassistance to its neighbour in building social facilities \r\nand initiated the implementation of major transport \r\nand energy projects with Afghanistan’s participation. \r\nIn particular, I note the project envisaging construction \r\nof the Turkmenistan/Pakistan/India gas pipeline, \r\npreparations for which are nearing the final stages. \r\nAnother major project, which was launched in May \r\nlast year, involves the construction of a Turkmenistan/\r\nAfghanistan/Tajikstan railway. We consider these \r\nprojects to be key in rebuilding the economy and \r\nsocial spheres of Afghanistan, and enabling it to make \r\nthetransition to a peaceful and creative existence.\r\nFor a number of years our country has consistently \r\nsupplied electric power to Afghanistan on highly \r\nfavourable terms. In the near future, thanks to the \r\ncommissioning of new power-generating capacities \r\nin Turkmenistan, we are prepared to increase the \r\nvolume of power supplied to Afghanistan many-fold. \r\nAs in the past, we provide purpose-oriented training \r\nof specialists for the Afghan economy, health care \r\nand social spheres. We will continue to provide all-\r\nencompassing help to the fraternal Afghan people. It is \r\nour principled position.\r\nTurkmenistan believes that the irreversible nature \r\nof the disarmament process is the most important \r\nprerequisite for the peaceful and creative development \r\nof the region and the establishment of a climate of trust, \r\nopenness and cooperation in Central Asia. Our country \r\nproceeds from the assumption that the inert model of the \r\npast century, which was based on the constant build-up \r\nof armaments, has become irrelevant in today’s world. \r\nFurthermore, it considerably hampers and sometimes \r\ndirectly undermines efforts by States towards social \r\nand economic development, the enhancement of \r\npeople’s standards of living, and the development of \r\nsuccessful economic cooperation. It is our conviction \r\nthat the fewer weapons there are in the world, the more \r\nstable and peaceful its development will be, and the \r\nmore trust and understanding among countries and \r\npeoples will deepen.\r\nWe call for consistent strengthening of international \r\nand regional cooperation in reducing the arsenals \r\nof weapons of mass destruction and the effective \r\nimplementation of the non-proliferation regime. As a \r\n28/29 14-54835\r\nA/69/PV.8 24/09/2014\r\nparty to the basic disarmament treaties and conventions \r\nof the United Nations, Turkmenistan intends to continue \r\nto provide support to all the relevant processes.In this \r\nconnection, while emphasizing the landmark nature of \r\nthe first session of the Preparatory Committee for the \r\n2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons that was \r\nheld in Vienna in 2012, Turkmenistan believes that it \r\nis key to continue the current dialogue on measures \r\naimed at expanding the international legal framework \r\nof non-proliferation.\r\nThis dialogue becomes especially relevant in view \r\nof the practical steps that are being taken in order to \r\nimplement the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone \r\nin Central Asia. Our country stands ready to engage in \r\nconstructive disarmament cooperation with the Office \r\nof the Deputy Secretary-General and to participate in \r\nthe implementation of a number of initiatives in this \r\nregard. One of the practical steps in the implementation \r\nof measures for disarmament could be the improvement \r\nof existing United Nations structures. In this \r\ncontext, we believe that it will be useful to consider \r\nthe establishment of a United Nations subregional \r\ndisarmament centre in Central Asia.\r\nTurkmenistan looks forward to the logical \r\ncontinuation at this session of the broad-based dialogue \r\non energy security as one of the fundamental elements \r\nof the United Nations sustainable development strategy \r\ninitiated by the President of Turkmenistan. As is well \r\nknown, in May 2013 the General Assembly unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 67/263 entitled “Reliable and stable \r\ntransit of energy and its role in ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment and international cooperation”. The \r\nresolution was sponsored by 71 Member States. The \r\nadoption of the resolution was yet another major and \r\nconsecutive step in advancing international cooperation \r\nin the sphere of energy. We believe that adherence to \r\nthe letter and spirit of that document should acquire a \r\nsubstantive and purpose-oriented nature.\r\nIn this connection, we call on Member States and \r\nthe Secretariat to actively undertake consultations on \r\nthe practical implementation of the provisions of this \r\nresolution. In particular, we note the institutionalization \r\nof the work of the international group of experts on \r\nenergy cooperation and nominating representatives \r\nof Member States to that group. In December, the \r\nfirst international meeting of experts will take place \r\nin Turkmenistan. It is designed to launch systematic \r\nwork on the establishment of a new legal framework of \r\ncooperation in sustainable energy. We invite Member \r\nStates and all interested parties to take part in it.\r\nThe outcome document of the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio de \r\nJaneiro, entitled “The future we want” (resolution \r\n66/288, annex), emphasizes the central role of transport \r\nand mobility in sustainable development. We fully \r\nshare that approach. Moreover, Turkmenistan is \r\nconvinced that it is high time to undertake systematic \r\nglobal cooperation and strategic planning in transport \r\nas a separate, long-term area of United Nations activity.\r\nIn early September, Turkmenistan’s capital hosted \r\na high-level international conference dedicated to \r\nthe role of transport and transit corridors in ensuring \r\ninternational cooperation, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The Ashgabat Declaration adopted at \r\nthe end of the Conference reflects the need to develop \r\nnew modern criteria for cooperation in this sphere \r\nthat are oriented towards diversification, security, \r\naccessibility, environmental safety of the transportation \r\ninfrastructure, and its maximum correspondence to the \r\nrealities of current global development, taking into \r\naccount the needs of developing countries, including \r\nlandlocked States. As the President of Turkmenistan \r\nemphasized in his address to the participants at that \r\nconference, the global transport strategy of the twenty-\r\nfirst century is a strategy for integration, combining \r\ngeographical and infrastructural opportunities with \r\nthe technical and technological potentials of States and \r\nregions.\r\nThe very fact of the convening of that conference \r\nwas a momentous event, signalling a comprehensive \r\napproach to the development of transport and transit \r\ncorridors based on constructive and real partnerships. \r\nOur country has submitted the Ashgabat Declaration \r\nto the Secretariat for its distribution among Member \r\nStates as an official document. We hope that it will be \r\nstudied with interest and that there will be further use of \r\nthis Declaration in international agreements, including \r\nthose of the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly.\r\nWith a view to the accelerated development of \r\ninternational transport infrastructure, Turkmenistan \r\nadvocates closer cooperation and partnerships with \r\nspecialized bodies of the United Nations, first and \r\nforemost the Economic Commission for Europe and \r\nthe Economic and Social Commission for Asia and \r\nthe Pacific. We are convinced that such cooperation \r\ncorresponds to the logic of modern development and \r\n14-54835 29/29\r\n24/09/2014 A/69/PV.8\r\ninternational cooperation in transport in the Eurasian \r\ncontinent.\r\nTurkmenistan fully supports the decisions taken \r\nduring the Summits on Climate Change held in \r\nCopenhagen and Cancún, at the seventeenth Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change held in Durban, and \r\nat the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We look forward to the continuation of \r\nconstructive international dialogue on these issues. We \r\nare convinced that it is necessary to consistently combine \r\nefforts at the international, regional and national levels. \r\nIn this context, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to implement the agreed-upon decisions and \r\nhis sense of utmost responsibility in his approach \r\nto international cooperation with respect to climate \r\nchange issues. Our country recently launched a number \r\nof specific initiatives aimed at enhancing regional and \r\nglobal cooperation in this sphere.\r\nI wish to single out Turkmenistan’s humanitarian \r\nefforts as a member of major United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies. Turkmenistan takes practical \r\nsteps to ensure the rights and freedoms of its citizens. \r\nIn particular, our country devotes major attention \r\nto solving issues relating to the rights of refugees, \r\nmigrants and stateless persons. Last June, in our \r\ncapital, the Government of Turkmenistan, along with \r\nthe International Organization for Migration (IOM) and \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees, organized the International Conference \r\non Migration and Statelessness. Upon its conclusion, \r\nthe Conference adopted a declaration that spells out \r\nurgent tasks to improve multilateral cooperation, \r\nstrengthen international legal frameworks, and reform \r\nnational legislation on migrants andstateless persons \r\nand their legal and social protection, material support \r\nand adaptation. Turkmenistan will endeavour at this \r\nsession to translate the main provisions of this outcome \r\ndocument into reality. We reaffirm our desire and \r\nreadiness to continue close cooperation with the IOM, \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees, Member States and all stakeholders.\r\nOur country views the sixty-ninth session as a \r\nmajor step towards consolidating international efforts \r\nto resolve key issues on the global agenda, to reaffirm \r\nthe leading role of the United Nations in maintaining \r\nand strengthening universal peace and stability and to \r\nagree on sustainable development goals. We reaffirm \r\nour strong commitment to cooperation with the United \r\nNations, our readiness to actively participate and \r\npromote its peacekeeping, political and diplomatic \r\nendeavours and to implement its projects and \r\nprogrammes in the economic, social, environmental, \r\nhumanitarian and other spheres.\r\nFor Turkmenistan, partnership with the United \r\nNations has been and continues to be a strategic priority, \r\na conceptual and practical foundation for our activities \r\nin the international arena.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10 p.m.\r\n"
