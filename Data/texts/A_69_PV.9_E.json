That gives us an opportunity \r\nonce again to further explore the questions that are \r\nof concern to all of us. It is nearly post-2015 already, \r\nand crafting a programme that goes beyond that date \r\nrequires that we take stock of the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nDespite the remarkable progress in the \r\nimplementation of some of those goals, it is now clear \r\nthat there are still vast gaps in other goals, which will \r\npersist when the programme is concluded. With respect \r\nto the Niger, for example, the implementation of the 3N \r\nInitiative, “Les Nigériens nourrissent les Nigériens”, \r\nhas already allowed us to achieve target C of MDG 1, \r\nwhich has to do with reducing by half the number of \r\npeople who are suffering from hunger. The Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations has \r\nrecognized that, in that area, the Niger has achieved \r\nimpressive results in record time. Our country has \r\nalso achieved target A of MDG 6, with an HIV/AIDS \r\nprevalence rate of 0.4 per cent in 2012, as compared \r\nwith a target of 0.7 per cent in 2015.\r\nWith respect to reducing by half the proportion of \r\npeople whose income is less than $1 per day, ensuring \r\nprimary education for all, strengthening gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women, dealing with \r\nthe mortality of children under five years, reducing \r\nmaternal mortality and promoting a sustainable \r\nenvironment, major efforts have ben undertaken. Still, \r\nthose goals will most likely not be achieved, despite the \r\nUnited Nations A/69/PV.9\r\nasdf\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSixty-ninth session\r\n9th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 25 September 2014, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Kutesa . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Uganda)\r\n2/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nimplementation of the programme of recovery currently \r\nunder way since my election in 2011.\r\nIn drafting the new post-2015 agenda, we naturally \r\nneed to maintain all of the unachieved MDGs and \r\nprovide for measures to avoid a deterioration in \r\nareas where the goals have already been achieved. \r\nFor example, the issue of the demographic dividend \r\nshould be a priority on the agenda. The demographic \r\ndividend, the Assembly will recall, consists of both \r\nthe demographic transition and inclusive economic \r\ngrowth. More specifically, the demographic dividend \r\nmeans, on the one hand, reducing maternal, infant and \r\njuvenile mortality and controlling birth and, on the \r\nother hand, providing for sustainable development with \r\nits three pillars: economic, social and environmental. \r\nThe demographic transition is needed to strengthen \r\nsustained growth, which in turn should accelerate \r\nthe demographic transition. I continue to believe that \r\nthe best contraceptive method, the best condom, is \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe post-2015 agenda will be dominated by what \r\nI would call the three D’s — defence or security, \r\ndemocracy and development. It is fortunate that the \r\ninternational community has now established a close \r\ncorrelation among those three fundamental challenges, \r\nwhich are interconnected. Global peace and security \r\ntoday are, however, threatened by terrorism, by \r\norganized crime, by demands based on identity and \r\nby the growth of inequality, which have led to the \r\nworsening of poverty around the world, from Iraq to \r\nLibya, from Syria to Nigeria and from Mali to Somalia.\r\nThe enemies who embody that terrorist threat \r\nare engaged in an unconventional and asymmetrical \r\ncombat. They are sending out propaganda through their \r\nactions and seek to control populations through terror, \r\nincluding rape; kidnapping young girls, as in Chibok, \r\nNigeria; taking hostages in exchange for ransom: and \r\nmurder. The war pursued against them is no longer \r\na conventional, industrial war of the kind for which \r\nour armies have been trained. Warfare among our \r\npopulations is not a new phenomenon, but in recent \r\nyears, it has taken on an exceptional dimension. To deal \r\nwith that situation, we need to change the paradigm and \r\nmove from a paradigm of classic conventional war to \r\nthat of the war that takes place among our populations, \r\nwhich, in turn, presupposes that our countries reform \r\ntheir armies. That also presupposes that our countries \r\ntrain special forces that are capable of adapting to the \r\nmethods of the enemy.\r\nIn order to eradicate the Islamic State or the \r\nAl-Nusra Front in Iraq and Syria, neutralize the jihadist \r\norganizations in Libya, overcome Al-Qaida in the Islamic \r\nMaghreb and Al-Mourabitoun in the Sahel, particularly \r\nin Mali, and oust the Al-Shabaab from Somalia and \r\nBoko Haram in Nigeria, the international community \r\nneeds to establish a shared goal and strategy, working \r\nwith the countries involved. The common political aim \r\nis to defend our democratic institutions and protect our \r\npeoples. The strategy would then necessarily have to \r\ndo with cutting off the sources financing terrorism, \r\nwhether those sources are States or the drug trade or \r\nthe payment of ransom. The strategy also needs to deal \r\nwith the terrorist strategy, which generates propaganda \r\nthrough its actions, and unfortunately, its propaganda \r\nis heavily covered by the media and social media on the \r\nInternet. In addition, a just settlement of the Palestinian \r\nissue could certainly contribute to the fight against this \r\nscourge.\r\nAs a neighbour of Libya, Nigeria and Mali, the \r\nNiger is deeply concerned by the situation prevailing in \r\nthose countries. In Libya, the international community, \r\ntogether with neighbouring countries, must establish the \r\nconditions that would enable it to neutralize the militias, \r\nreconcile all Libyans without exception and form a \r\nGovernment of union that would organize elections \r\nunder the guidance of the international community. The \r\ncurrent United Nations Support Mission in Libya must \r\nbe replaced by a more robust structure, and in this case, \r\na stabilization and institution-building mission. The \r\ninternational community will then have to undertake \r\na vast diplomatic initiative under the auspices of the \r\nSecretary-General to promote national reconciliation, \r\nwhich is needed to bring about the end of violence and \r\nchaos as well as to assist in the emergence of the true \r\nrule of law.\r\nWhatever the case may be, as the leader of a country \r\nthat is a neighbour of Libya and whose economy and \r\nsecurity have been seriously affected by what has been \r\ntaking place there for three years, my belief is that it is \r\ndangerous to leave the current state of affairs in play as \r\nit is. We therefore need to have the courage to radically \r\nchange our perspective and act so as to help Libyans \r\nrealize their sole aspiration, which is to live in peace.\r\nWith respect to Nigeria, Boko Haram has been \r\nextremely aggressive and has demonstrated a barbarism \r\nnever seen before, with its recent incursions into \r\nCameroon and the occupation of ever more territory, \r\ngoing so far as to threaten Maiduguri, the capital of \r\n14-54841 3/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nthe federated state of Borno in Nigeria. It is evident \r\nthat that terrorist group has aims that are much \r\nlarger than had been thought. That means that more \r\neffort and cooperation are needed at the regional and \r\ninternational levels in order to deal with the problem \r\neffectively. It is in that perspective that the heads of \r\nState and Government of Cameroon, the Niger, Nigeria \r\nand Chad — the members of the Lake Chad Basin \r\nCommission — and Benin, will meet in Niamey on \r\n7 October 2014 to pool their efforts in the fight against \r\nthis serious threat.\r\nRegarding Mali, I welcome the inclusive inter-Malian \r\ndialogue that is currently taking place under the auspices \r\nof Algeria. I express the hope that the dialogue will lead \r\nto an agreement that respects the unity and integrity \r\nof Mali. In Mali, as in the Central African Republic, \r\nthe question of unity is essential. The Pandora’s box \r\nof Balkanization, which has been opened elsewhere in \r\nAfrica, must be closed again if we do not want the rest \r\nof the continent to catch fire. The future of Africa is \r\nin its unity. The best way to do away with the borders \r\ninherited from colonization is not to create new borders \r\nalong ethnic or religious lines, but to go beyond current \r\nborders through integration.\r\nGlobal security can be ensured only by States with \r\nstrong and stable democratic institutions. The post-\r\n2015 programme must be a priority. Global security \r\ncan also not be guaranteed as long as inequalities in \r\ntrade between nations and income inequality within \r\nnations persist. Inequalities are morally unacceptable \r\nand economically inefficient. Therefore, the struggle \r\nagainst inequality has always been an essential question \r\nand one that we must stop avoiding, if we want a more \r\njust, humane and prosperous world. That struggle must \r\nbe central to the post-2015 programme.\r\nObservers are unanimous in saying that Africa, \r\nwith its high rates of economic growth, is the continent \r\nof the twenty-first century. That is true, but only if our \r\ncontinent definitively emerges from the unequal trade \r\nsituation and from the colonial pact that has always \r\ntreated Africa as merely a reservoir of raw materials, \r\noften sold cheaply, as in the old days when slaves or \r\nvast territories were acquired in exchange for mirrors, \r\npins, needles and other junk. The African continent \r\nwill actually be the continent of the twenty-first \r\ncentury when it, itself, works with its raw materials, \r\nthat is to say once it takes the place that it deserves \r\nin world industrial production. Africa will be the \r\ncontinent of the twenty-first century once its relations \r\nwith other nations are governed by equitable trade and \r\nnot by official development assistance. Africa will be \r\nthe continent of the twenty-first century when there \r\nis a huge middle class arising from good political and \r\neconomic governance, including a better distribution of \r\nincome to reduce poverty.\r\nCurrently, according to a study by the African \r\nDevelopment Bank, the African middle class, which is \r\ndefined as the proportion of Africans with an income \r\nbetween $2 and $20 a day, represents about 30 per cent \r\nof the population. Our ambition should be to increase \r\nthat number to 80 per cent. The vision contained in the \r\n2063 agenda of the African Union suggests that we are \r\non the right track. It is in the interest of the international \r\ncommunity to include priorities that are on the agenda \r\nof our continent in the post-2015 programme.\r\nThe twenty-first century must be the century when \r\nAfrica equips itself with roads and rail and energy \r\ninfrastructure and new information and communication \r\ntechnologies. It will also be the century of an agriculture \r\nthat feeds our population, which is growing larger, and \r\nthe century of access to water and sanitation services \r\nand to education, including vocational and technical \r\ntraining to enable each young person to have a trade.\r\nHowever, if our children and grandchildren are to \r\nhave a chance at having a better quality of life, we must \r\nmeet the challenge of climate change. In that regard, \r\nwe must congratulate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\non his initiative to convene the Climate Summit. That \r\nconference’s outcome will be the basis for the decisions \r\nthat the international community is called upon to \r\ntake at the climate conference to be held in Paris in \r\nDecember 2015.\r\nWe have the imperative duty to save our planet. The \r\nglobal temperature is increasing owing to greenhouse \r\ngases, which have led, to take the example of the Sahel \r\nregion, to a decrease in rainfall and reduced water \r\nf lows, with the silting up of waterways, as in the case of \r\nthe Niger River; the drying up of Lake Chad, which has \r\nlost 90 per cent of its area in 50 years, shrinking from \r\n25,000 square kilometres to 2,500; extreme flooding \r\nand drought; reduced plant cover, including forest loss; \r\nreduced biodiversity; reduced crop yields; and thus the \r\nimpoverishment of the population, whose young people \r\nthen become an easy target for recruitment by terrorists \r\nand organized crime.\r\nHowever, since the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference in Copenhagen, we have seen not a decrease \r\n4/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nbut an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. If nothing \r\nis done, the temperature increase may surpass 2 degrees \r\ncentigrade in 20 to 30 years and reach 4 degrees by the \r\nend of the century. We must therefore regroup and focus \r\non promoting clean energy, such as hydro-electricity, \r\nnuclear energy and solar energy, provided that, in the \r\nlatter case, we create competitive conditions for it. We \r\nalso need to promote what is called smart agriculture \r\nand make adjustments in the industrial, transport and \r\nconstruction sectors.\r\nI hope that humanity will not squander the \r\nopportunity that will be provided in Paris. I hope that \r\nwe will implement a development model that will \r\nenable us to save our planet. I hope that we will be able \r\nto build a more just and humane world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Niger \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Niger, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrej Kiska, President of the \r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak Republic, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kiska: At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session and to \r\nwish you every success in your important duties.\r\nLet me begin with a quote by Edward Wilson:\r\n“The great challenge of the twenty-first century \r\nis to raise people everywhere to a decent standard \r\nof living, while preserving as much of the rest of \r\nlife as possible.”\r\nTo preserve life and the sustainability of the planet \r\nfor every human is not pure theory. It is a practical \r\nquestion for our future and for that of our children. \r\nThe Millennium Development Goals, the post-2015 \r\nframework and the challenge of climate change must \r\nform much more than the theoretical basis for our \r\ndiscussions. Those goals must identify, address, offer \r\na solution to and solve problems that in one or two \r\ngenerations may bring the human race to the brink of \r\nits own existence.\r\nSeventy years ago, when the Second World War \r\ncaused tens of millions of deaths, consuming all of \r\nthe principles of humanity, the patriots and democrats \r\nin my country, Slovakia, took up arms and put their \r\nlives at risk to fight against evil and for liberty and \r\ndemocratic values. They fought together with many \r\nother nations to establish the foundation for new global \r\ncooperation, given shape a year later with the adoption \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. The horrors of \r\nthe Second World War, the failure of the international \r\ncommunity to maintain world peace, the direct threat \r\non the part of larger countries to use force against \r\nsmaller ones and the absence of an international order \r\nand rules that are be universally accepted and respected \r\nwere a painful lesson for us all.\r\nCooperation among nations has come a long way in \r\nthe past seven decades. The United Nations has played \r\nan important role on that road, but we have not gathered \r\nhere to celebrate a false sense of success. We have to \r\ngo much further than simply to identify challenges. It \r\nwould be a lost opportunity if political correctness and \r\ndiplomatic language were to limit us from openly and \r\nfreely naming and discussing the problems that plague \r\nour world and the continents, countries and citizens that \r\nwe represent. We must not betray the commitments that \r\nwe all made to the principles of democracy, peace and \r\nsecurity for every single citizen of our planet. We must \r\nlook into the mirror to see what we are doing, how we do \r\nit, what we are doing or have done wrong and what we \r\ncan do better. We believed that the number of conflicts \r\nwould gradually decrease as our civilization matured \r\nand developed. However, today, we are confronted \r\nwith the opposite reality. Instability is increasingly \r\nbecoming the new status quo. Instability, poverty and \r\nhatred are the fertilizers and catalysts of terrorism, and \r\nterrorism is a threat to which no one is immune.\r\nA year ago, we Europeans could hardly imagine \r\nthat, after investing so much effort in achieving peace \r\nand stability in our continent, a new armed conflict \r\nwould arise in our neighbourhood. Conflict is dangerous \r\nboth in its nature and in its consequences. Twenty \r\nyears ago, Ukraine abandoned its nuclear programme \r\nin exchange for the security and territorial integrity \r\nguarantees granted by the United States, the United \r\n14-54841 5/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nKingdom, China, France and the Russian Federation. \r\nToday, instead of marking a major anniversary of \r\nachievement in the area of security and stability on the \r\nEuropean continent, we are witnessing armed conflict \r\nand political instability. Instead of building a world \r\nwithout weapons of mass destruction, we encourage \r\nthose countries that seek security under the lethal \r\nnuclear umbrella.\r\nSlovakia strongly denounces violations of the \r\nterritorial integrity of any State. That is a trademark \r\nof our foreign policy. It is a pillar for the stability of \r\nthe geopolitical architecture. We support that principle, \r\nand Ukraine and the annexation of the Crimea are \r\nnot an exception. We are nevertheless convinced that \r\ndialogue and diplomatic efforts, with the participation \r\nof Russia, will lead to sustainable peace in Ukraine. \r\nWe must respect the territorial integrity of Ukraine and \r\nthe sovereign right of its people to decide their fate in a \r\nfree and independent manner. The United Nations plays \r\na crucial role in that matter. What Ukraine needs today \r\nis to restore peace and stability, implement reforms \r\nand be reassured of the strength of the guarantees for \r\nthe inviolability of its territory. Slovakia is ready to \r\nparticipate in that process.\r\nDiplomatic language is full of allegories, but \r\neven the nicest language cannot hide the naked truth \r\nwhen people are being killed. Acts of barbarism and \r\ncruelty have become a freely available article. They are \r\nbroadcast live to our homes. They make us insensitive \r\nto violence far away. At the same time, they create the \r\nfeeling of having being born into an unsafe world, in \r\nwhich people ask: where is the effective protective \r\numbrella of the United Nations?\r\nA year ago, we could not imagine the sudden rise \r\nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), \r\nwhich has become a global threat in a short time. It has \r\novershadowed the long-term effort of the international \r\ncommunity in Iraq. The ideology and acts of ISIL \r\nrepresent an unprecedented level of brutality and the \r\ntwisted use of the media for their self-promotion. It \r\nrepresents the dangerous ideology of forcing violent \r\nchanges to State borders. It embodies ethnic and \r\nreligious cleansing, which will not stop at the borders \r\nof Iraq, Syria or the neighbouring countries, but has the \r\nambition to spread beyond the region of the Middle East. \r\nThe entire global community has the responsibility to \r\nact in order to end the suffering of the innocent victims \r\nof violence and to protect children and women. Today, \r\nwe must to stand united in Iraq and prevent ISIL from \r\ntaking root in the territory it has occupied and from \r\nconsolidating its military and economic power.\r\nAutocratic and totalitarian ideologies always bring \r\nsuffering, the restriction of rights, internal conflict, \r\ninjustice and death. We are all too familiar with \r\ntheir ultimate price and catastrophic consequences. \r\nAmong the many tasks facing the United Nations \r\nare the prevention of such ideologies from becoming \r\nsuccessful, the protection of human rights, the adoption \r\nof every possible preventive measures to prevent \r\nconflict and the establishment of sustainable peace.\r\nSlovakia, with its own first-hand experience of \r\ntransitioning from a totalitarian regime to democracy, \r\nsupports efforts to create the conditions necessary for \r\nsustainable peace. We promote security sector reform \r\nas one of the key factors for success in the peaceful \r\ndevelopment in regions emerging from conflict, as \r\nwell as for States going through a regime change to \r\ndemocracy. Stable security institutions such as the police \r\nand military can better fulfil their duties to safeguard \r\nhuman rights and protect their citizens, especially \r\nsociety’s most vulnerable members, including women \r\nand girls.\r\nThe Slovak Republic actively fulfils its commitments \r\nto Afghanistan. The United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nin Afghanistan is led by a diplomat from Slovakia. We \r\nremain convinced that in the aftermath of the recent \r\npresidential election, the new Afghan leadership will \r\nbe able to create the conditions needed to achieve \r\nnational and social unity and to continue supporting \r\ninternational assistance. I am pleased to note that the \r\ntwo former presidential candidates have reached an \r\nagreement, and we believe that that will contribute to \r\nAfghanistan’s stability. Slovakia is ready to continue \r\nto do its part in assisting the Afghan people in that \r\nendeavour.\r\nDisarmament is key to eliminating potential \r\nsources of tension and conflict. Last year’s signing of \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty was an important step towards \r\nestablishing common legal standards for regulating \r\nand monitoring international trade in conventional \r\nweapons. The Slovak Republic was among the first 50 \r\ncountries to ratify the Treaty, and we are hopeful that \r\nits implementation will contribute to eliminating the \r\ndangers of the illegal arms trade and thus strengthen \r\nglobal security.\r\nLast but not least, peace, security and stability \r\nare preconditions for development. The rule of law, \r\n6/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\ndemocratic governance and human rights are essential \r\nfor every single citizen. But we must address, respond \r\nto and solve the global issues that may be as deadly \r\nfor humankind as a nuclear war — the changes that \r\nare occurring on our planet. Globalization has created \r\nborderless opportunities for entrepreneurship, but it has \r\nalso created new challenges that we must deal with if we \r\nare to make life on Earth sustainable — climate change, \r\ninequalities in development and in the distribution of \r\ngoods and services, poverty and unequal access to \r\nhealth and education.\r\nSlovakia is and will remain a responsible member of \r\nthe global community. We participate in the discussion \r\non financing sustainable development, offering our own \r\nexperience of economic transition. Global challenges \r\nrequire global action and national responsibility. We \r\nare ready to do our share.\r\nThe peoples of the world have vested in the United \r\nNations an exclusive and global responsibility: to \r\nrespond to violations of peace, ensusre respect for \r\ninternational law, protect human rights and deal with \r\nthreats to humanity. Let us all make sure that it is able \r\nto continue to carry out those responsibilities. For \r\ndecades, the Organization has been the forum where we \r\ncan name those responsible for the murder of their own \r\ncitizens on a massive scale, the leaders who worship a \r\ncult of hatred and intolerance, and those who favour \r\narms over agreements and international law. But in the \r\ncases where we have failed, our failure has caused the \r\nsuffering and death of innocent people.\r\nWe, the United Nations, should not give up on \r\nthe ideal of being the conscience of the world. Our \r\nOrganization should be the authority with the ability \r\nto define, prevent and solve conflicts and problems. \r\nTogether we must convince people around the world \r\nthat we are safeguarding the international norms and \r\nprinciples that the United Nations is built on. If we fail \r\nto accomplish that within the United Nations itself, \r\nwe will not be able to guarantee to humankind that \r\ntotalitarianism, injustice, impunity and amorality will \r\nnot prevail.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Slovak Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak Republic, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. John Dramani Mahama, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Dramani Mahama, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mahama: Change has become an \r\noverriding theme in the language of today`s social and \r\npolitical landscape. We speak of the need to change \r\nbehaviours, attitudes and laws. We speak of the need \r\nto effect change in the areas of human rights and social \r\njustice, in education and health administration. We \r\nhave come to understand the concept of change as a \r\nconstant in our lives as human beings and as citizens \r\nof this world. But the question we are asking is, does \r\nchange automatically signify progress?\r\nThere is an old saying with which I am sure everyone \r\nhere is familiar: the more things change, the more they \r\nstay the same. Sometimes, when I find myself listening \r\nto reports of the many recent developments taking place \r\nin the world, that saying comes to mind again, and I am \r\novercome with a strong sense of déjà vu, as though we \r\nhad been here before.\r\nWhen I hear reports about the taking of hostages \r\nand the savagery of beheadings, it is 2004 all over \r\nagain, and week after week there is news of the killing \r\nof foreign hostages in Iraq. When I hear reports about \r\nIsrael and Gaza, it is 2005 all over again, and Israel \r\nhas launched Operation Summer Rain, immediately \r\nfollowed by Operation Autumn Clouds. The resulting \r\ndeath toll in the Gaza Strip was in the hundreds, and \r\nmany of the dead were children. Similarly, in the United \r\nStates, reports of police brutality against an unarmed \r\nblack man take me back to 1999, when 23-year-old \r\nGuinea-born Amadou Diallo was shot 19 times by four \r\nNew York City police officers, or to 1991, when Rodney \r\nKing was brutally beaten by five Los Angeles police \r\nofficers. Both of those incidents caused a tremendous \r\npublic outcry, as did this year’s shooting death of \r\n18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, \r\nwith the singular message of “no justice, no peace”.\r\n14-54841 7/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nDo such events indicate an outright regression? \r\nDoes the uncomfortable familiarity of some current \r\nworld events mean that, despite the changes so many \r\nindividuals and organizations have worked to achieve, \r\nwe have made little or no progress? I would like to \r\nbelieve that this is not so. I would like to believe those \r\nevents of recent times are merely setbacks that will \r\nmotivate us to find more sustainable solutions; they \r\nare just slight reversals on the sinuous path toward true \r\nprogress.\r\nDag Hammarskjöld, who served as the second \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, from 1953 \r\nuntil his untimely death in a plane crash in 1961, said,\r\n“The pursuit of peace and progress cannot \r\nend in a few years in either victory or defeat. The \r\npursuit of peace and progress, with its trials and its \r\nerrors, its successes and its setbacks, can never be \r\nrelaxed and never abandoned.”\r\nIn the course of the past several months, since \r\nthe beginning of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, \r\nI have been reminded of both the importance and \r\nthe practicality of those words. True progress relies \r\non neither victory nor defeat; true progress relies on \r\npersistence, on perseverance. Just last week, on Monday, \r\nin my capacity as the Chair of Economic Community of \r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), I travelled to Liberia, \r\nSierra Leone and Guinea — the three countries that \r\nhave been most affected by the outbreak of Ebola. They \r\nare nations that are recovering from conflict. The civil \r\nwars in Liberia and Sierra Leone also adversely affected \r\nGuinea, which shares borders with both countries. \r\nThey are nations that were struggling to rebuild their \r\nsocial and economic infrastructure. Even before the \r\noutbreak of Ebola, they were already operating with \r\nlimited resources, an insufficient number of treatment \r\nfacilities and a shortage of qualified medical personnel.\r\nSo far, there have been 5,843 recorded cases of Ebola, \r\nincluding 2,803 deaths. The World Health Organization \r\npredicts that if the disease is not brought under control, \r\nthe number of cases could easily rise to 20,000 by as \r\nearly as November. What makes Ebola so dangerous is \r\nthat the virus dares us to compromise the impulses that \r\nexist at the very core of our humanity — our impulse \r\nto comfort one another with love, to care for each other \r\nwith the healing power of touch and to maintain the \r\ndignity of our loved ones even in death, with a public \r\nfuneral and a properly marked grave.\r\nEbola is a disease of isolation. It leaves family \r\nmembers afraid to embrace one another. It leaves \r\nhealth-care workers afraid to attend to their patients. \r\nIt forces the living to abandon the cultural rites of \r\nwashing, embalming and burying their dead. Instead, \r\nthe dead are zipped into a secure body bag, carried on \r\na stretcher by makeshift pallbearers in protective wear, \r\nand then tossed into a freshly dug grave.\r\nJust as individuals with Ebola are often shunned and \r\nostracized by their communities, the initial slowness of \r\nresponse by the international community in many ways \r\nhas left the affected countries to suffer their fate alone \r\nand in isolation. In my travels to those three countries, \r\nalthough I was aware that some airlines had suspended \r\nf lights, I was shocked to find the airports completely \r\nvacant. Ebola is not just a Liberian problem, nor is it a \r\nSierra Leonean or Guinean problem; it is not just a West \r\nAfrican problem. Ebola is a problem that belongs to the \r\nworld because it is a disease that knows no boundaries.\r\nWe cannot afford to let fear keep us away or to let \r\nit compromise the very impulses that not only define \r\nbut sustain our humanity. We must erase the stigma. To \r\nthat end, my country, Ghana, has offered the use of its \r\ncapital city, Accra, as a base of operations for activities \r\ngeared towards the containment of the disease. I would \r\nlike to commend Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nthe Security Council for establishing the United Nations \r\nMission for Ebola Emergency Response. I would also \r\nlike to acknowledge and commend President Barack \r\nObama and the people of the United States of America \r\nfor their enormous commitment to the fight against \r\nEbola.\r\nHealth officials have announced numerous times \r\nthat in theory, it is relatively easy to stop the spread \r\nof Ebola because it is transmitted through contact \r\nwith bodily f luids. It has been suggested that through \r\nchanges in our behaviour and practices the public could \r\npotentially reduce, if not eliminate, their exposure \r\nto the virus. Yet in reality, the Ebola virus was able \r\nto spread so quickly throughout the West African \r\nsubregion because of the f luidity of our borders.\r\nThe free movement of people, goods and services \r\nthroughout the West African subregion is something \r\nthat ECOWAS has been promoting for the last several \r\ndecades. It allows interaction and increased trade \r\nbetween our 15 member States. However, without the \r\nproper preventive measures in place, such f luidity can \r\nalso enable the free movement of disease, drugs, arms, \r\nhuman traffickers and terrorists.\r\n8/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nUnfortunately. Africa is especially vulnerable to \r\nterrorism because its sheer size and vast terrain offers \r\nmyriad places for terrorists to hide and create safe \r\nhavens. With over 60 per cent of Africa’s population \r\nunder the age of 35 and a significant number living in \r\nextreme poverty, terrorists also have the opportunity to \r\nrecruit new members by exploiting the ignorance and \r\ndisillusionment of young people who lack the skills, \r\neducation and opportunity to find gainful employment.\r\nThe proliferation of technology has made even \r\nthe most remote areas of the continent accessible \r\nthrough a phone call or keystroke. What that does is \r\nfacilitate communication within terrorist cells and \r\nbetween terrorist organizations. It would now be far \r\ntoo simplistic, not to mention myopic, for a nation \r\nto believe that it is dealing with any one terrorist \r\norganization, such as Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab. Ansar \r\nAl-Dine, Al-Qaida, Hizbullah, the Taliban, the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant or, recently, the Khorasan \r\ngroup. Because of the assistance and cooperation that \r\nexist among them, they have in fact become different \r\ntentacles of a single organism. So too must we come \r\ntogether as one cohesive body, united in our battle \r\nto defend our freedoms and values. We too must \r\ncommunicate within and among ourselves. We must \r\ncooperate and lend assistance and resources to fight \r\nand conquer the common threat we face.\r\nSince the start of the global recession, economic \r\ngrowth rates have generally declined and people have, \r\nby and large, become pessimistic about their future. \r\nThis month, the Pew Research Center published the \r\nresults of a 44-country survey conducted in the spring of \r\n2014 to assess public views of major economic changes \r\nin the world. According to the results, a global median \r\nof 69 per cent are not pleased with the way things are \r\ngoing in their countries. That includes both advanced \r\nand developing economies. The concerns expressed \r\ncut across a wide spectrum of issues, such as inflation, \r\nunemployment, income inequality and public debt.\r\nMy country, Ghana, is no exception. Over the \r\npast year, the public has seen an increase in the cost \r\nof living. Falling commodity prices led not only to a \r\nfall in tax revenues from companies that operate in \r\nGhana, but they also led to a massive decline in our \r\nexport earnings. That contributed to a general sense of \r\nmacroeconomic instability and placed a great deal of \r\npressure on our domestic currency, the cedi.\r\nFor the past 22 years, Ghanaians have witnessed \r\na steady improvement in the circumstances of our \r\nnation. With the return of democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw, six successful elections and peaceful transitions \r\nof power, Ghana became an example for other African \r\nnations turning towards democracy and constitutional \r\nrule. The stability inspired investor confidence and \r\nincreased growth. Soon Ghana was deemed one of the \r\nfastest-growing economies in the world.\r\nThat did not make us immune to the economic \r\nchallenges that many nations were facing across the \r\nglobe — quite the opposite. Instability in the global \r\ncommodity markets has a direct bearing on our budgets \r\nand hence on our ability to finance our development. \r\nThe global downturn exposed the weaknesses in our \r\nfoundation. It alerted us to the need for change, the \r\nneed to establish the proper institutions for effective \r\neconomic management, institutions that will foster \r\nresilience and an ability to better absorb the blows of \r\nunexpected occurrences or outcomes.\r\nThe anxieties and concerns of the Ghanaian public \r\nare understandable. Like so many African countries, \r\nGhana has been through dark economic times, and our \r\nseemingly changing fortunes, with their uncomfortable \r\nfamiliarity, brought on a fear of regression. But this \r\nwas merely a setback, only a slight reversal. Already, \r\nthe home-grown measures of fiscal stabilization that \r\nwe have taken are yielding results. Only this month, \r\nGhana surprised its most ardent critics when it launched \r\nits third Eurobond for an amount of $1 billion. That \r\nsuccessful f lotation represents a return of investor \r\nconfidence in the prospects of the Ghanaian economy. \r\nThat confidence is apparent in the recent rebound of \r\nour domestic currency, the cedi, which in the last two \r\nweeks has appreciated significantly against its major \r\ntrading currencies.\r\nLast year when I addressed the Assembly (see \r\nA/68/PV.12), I explained that it is not sympathy we \r\nwant in Africa; it is partnership, the ability to stand \r\non our own feet. In an attempt to establish such a \r\npartnership, we have entered into discussions with the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), an organization \r\nthat is no stranger to the process of self-assessment \r\nand the implementation of change in the pursuit of \r\ntrue progress. Indeed, both Ghana and the IMF have \r\nevolved, and the partnership has the potential to bring \r\nabout the sort of transformation that will move Ghana \r\nfrom the ranks of the low middle-income countries into \r\na fully f ledged middle-income country.\r\nThe coming year will mark the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Fourth World Conference on \r\n14-54841 9/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nWomen, which was held in Beijing in 1995. I would \r\nlike to note with pride that it will also mark the fortieth \r\nanniversary of Ghana’s establishment of the National \r\nCouncil on Women and Development, which has since \r\nbeen renamed the Department of Gender. Ghana has \r\na long-held commitment to the betterment of women’s \r\nlives, and my Administration has made it a priority to \r\ncarry on with that tradition. In fact, much, if not all, of \r\nwhat we are doing falls directly in line with the areas \r\nof concern enumerated in the Beijing Platform for \r\nAction of the World Conference. My Administration \r\nboasts one of the highest number of women appointed \r\nto public office in the history of Ghana. Seven of our \r\nCabinet ministers are women, as are the holders of \r\nseveral senior public service posts, and I hope that the \r\nfact that they are too numerous to list is an indication \r\nthat we are reaching towards the ideal.\r\nWe have submitted to Parliament an intestate \r\nsuccession bill, which ensures that if a spouse dies \r\nwithout having written a will, the surviving spouse will \r\nnot be dispossessed of their marital assets. We have also \r\nsubmitted to Parliament a bill on the property rights of \r\nspouses, which ensures that spouses are entitled to a fair \r\nportion of property acquired during the union. There \r\narea also several other pieces of legislation designed \r\nto offer protection for and empowerment of women, \r\nsuch as the Domestic Violence Act, the Anti-Human-\r\nTrafficking Act, an affirmative action bill and a gender \r\npolicy.\r\nI spoke earlier of isolation. Very few nations have \r\nexperienced the sort of exclusion that Cuba has suffered \r\nfor the last several decades as a result of the United \r\nStates embargo on that country. Ghana reaffirms its \r\nposition that this embargo should be lifted. Ghana also \r\ncalls for a halt to the establishment of settlements in the \r\nPalestinian territories. We have consistently expressed \r\nour support for a two-State solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian question, with the two nations coexisting \r\npeacefully.\r\nThis year the world’s attention has been drawn \r\nto the urgency of addressing the growing problem of \r\ninequality and the threats that it poses to our unrelenting \r\npursuit of peace. I would also like to draw attention \r\nto the pervasive presence of religious intolerance. At \r\nthe root of all of the world’s major religions is the call \r\nfor compassion, forgiveness, tolerance, peace and love. \r\nNevertheless, the use of religious dogma and extremism \r\nas a weapon of violence persists.\r\nIn this age of terrorism and political turmoil, of \r\nnational, regional and ethnic conflict, it may be tempting \r\nto use the actions of a few to justify prejudice toward \r\nmany. It may be tempting to combine the faithful with \r\nthe fanatical. But those of us who envision a just and \r\npeaceful world cannot, and should not, yield to those \r\ntemptations. Time and time again, history has shown us \r\nthat the changing of a world begins with the power that \r\nrests in the hands of the people, ordinary individuals. \r\nOr, in the words of one of the greatest teachers and \r\nleaders of non-violence, Mahatma Gandhi, “You must \r\nbe the change you wish to see in the world’’.\r\nToday our Jewish brothers and sisters are \r\ncelebrating Rosh Hashanah, their New Year. To them, \r\nI say, “L’shana Tova.” Next week, our Muslim brothers \r\nand sisters will be celebrating Eid al-Adha, the Festival \r\nof the Sacrifice. To them, I say, “Eid Mubarak.” And, \r\nto you, Mr. President, I say, “Many thanks for the \r\nopportunity and for your kind attention”.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Ghana \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Excellency, Mr. John Dramani Mahama, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Rouhani (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): At the \r\noutset, Mr. President, I would like to extend my sincere \r\ncongratulations on your well-deserved election as \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. I also express my appreciation to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon for all his efforts. It is \r\nmy genuine hope that this year’s session of the General \r\nAssembly brings the world, in its current critical \r\n10/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nsituation, a step closer to security and tranquility for \r\nhuman beings, which is of course a fundamental goal \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nI am from a region of the world whose many parts \r\nare currently burning in the fire of extremism and \r\nradicalism. To the east and to the west of my country, \r\nextremists threaten our neighbours, resort to violence \r\nand shed blood. They do not speak a single language; \r\nthey are not of a single skin colour and not of a single \r\nnationality — they have come to the Middle East from \r\naround the world. They do, however, have a single \r\nideology: violence and extremism. They also have a \r\nsingle goal: the destruction of civilization, thus giving \r\nrise to Islamophobia and creating a fertile ground for \r\nfurther intervention of foreign forces in our region.\r\nI deeply regret to say that terrorism has become \r\nglobalized from New York to Mosul, from Damascus \r\nto Baghdad, from the easternmost to the westernmost \r\nparts of the world, and from Al-Qaida to Daesh. The \r\nextremists of the world have found each other and have \r\nput out the call: “Extremists of the world, unite”. But \r\nare we united against the extremists?\r\nExtremism is not a regional issue with which only \r\nthe nations of our region have to grapple. Extremism \r\nis a global issue. Certain States have helped to create \r\nit and now fail to withstand it. Our peoples are \r\ncurrently paying the price. Today’s anti-Westernism \r\nis the offspring of yesterday’s colonialism. Today’s \r\nanti-Westernism is a reaction to yesterday’s racism. \r\nCertain intelligence agencies have put blades in the \r\nhand of madmen, who now spare no one. All those that \r\nhave played a role in founding and supporting those \r\nterror groups must acknowledge their errors that have \r\nled to extremism. They need to apologize not only to \r\nthe past generations but also to the next.\r\nTo fight the underlying causes of terrorism, one \r\nmust identify its roots and dry up its sources. Terrorism \r\ngerminates in poverty, unemployment, discrimination, \r\nhumiliation and injustice, and it grows in the culture of \r\nviolence. To uproot extremism, we must spread justice \r\nand development and not allow the distortion of divine \r\nteachings to justify brutality and cruelty. The pain is \r\nexacerbated when such terrorists spill blood in the \r\nname of religion and behead in the name of Islam. They \r\nseek to keep hidden the incontrovertible truth of history \r\nthat, on the basis of the teachings of all divine prophets, \r\nfrom Abraham to Moses, from Jesus to Muhammad, \r\ntaking the life of a human being is akin to killing all \r\nhumankind.\r\nI am astonished that those murderous groups call \r\nthemselves Islamic. What is more astonishing is that \r\nthe Western media, in line with them, repeat that \r\nfalse claim, which provokes the hatred of all Muslims. \r\nMuslim people, who daily recall their God as merciful \r\nand compassionate and have learned the lessons of \r\nkindness and empathy from their Prophet’s teachings, \r\nsee such defamation as part of an Islamophobic scheme.\r\nThe strategic blunders of the West in the Middle \r\nEast, Central Asia and the Caucuses have turned \r\nthose parts of the world into a haven for terrorists \r\nand extremists. The military aggression against \r\nAfghanistan and Iraq and inappropriate interference \r\nin the developments in Syria are clear examples of \r\nthat erroneous strategic approach in the Middle East. \r\nAs part of a non-peaceful approach, aggression and \r\noccupation target the lives and livelihoods of ordinary \r\npeople. They result in various adverse psychological \r\nand behavioral consequences that are today manifested \r\nin the form of violence and murder in the Middle East \r\nand North Africa, even attracting some citizens from \r\nother parts of the world.\r\nToday, violence is being spread to other parts of \r\nthe world like a contagious disease. We have always \r\nbelieved that democracy cannot be transplanted from \r\nabroad. Democracy is the product of growth and \r\ndevelopment, not war and aggression. Democracy is not \r\nan export product that can be commercially imported \r\nfrom the West to the East. In an underdeveloped \r\nsociety, imported democracy leads only to a weak and \r\nvulnerable Government.\r\nWhen commanding generals set foot in a region, \r\ndo not expect diplomats to greet them warmly. When \r\nwar begins, diplomacy tends to end. When sanctions \r\nset in, deep hatred for those imposing them also begins. \r\nWhen the atmosphere of the Middle East becomes \r\nsecuritized, there will be a similar response. The \r\ninterests of Western countries in our region are tied to \r\ntheir recognition of beliefs and the desire of the people \r\nfor democratic governance in the region.\r\nThe establishment of Al-Qaida, the Taliban and \r\nmodern extremist groups has demonstrated that one \r\ncannot use extremist groups to counter an opposing \r\nState and remain impervious to the consequences of \r\nrising extremism. The repetition of such mistakes, \r\ndespite the many costly experiences, is perplexing. Let \r\nus recall that Iran had invited everyone to dialogue \r\nbefore the criminal act of 11 September. We also called \r\n14-54841 11/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nfor a world against violence and extremism before the \r\noutbreak of the current violent atrocities.\r\nIn the past year, perhaps few people could have \r\nforecast the fire that rages today, but now uninhibited \r\nviolence and extremism present an imminent threat to \r\nthe world. It is self-evident that without an accurate \r\nunderstanding of the causes of the current situation, \r\nwe will not be able to find the right solutions. Today, \r\nI shall again warn against the spread of extremism and \r\nthe danger posed by the inadequate understanding of \r\nand incorrect approach to that phenomenon.\r\nThe Middle East longs for development and is \r\nweary of war. It is the natural right of the peoples of \r\nthe fertile lands of the Middle East to live in peace and \r\nprosperity. In the past, colonialism denied them that \r\nright. Today, the shadow of war and violence threatens \r\ntheir security.\r\nThere are moderate politicians and elites in our \r\nregion who enjoy the confidence of their peoples. They \r\nare neither anti- nor pro-Western. Aware of the role of \r\ncolonialism in the backwardness of their nations, they \r\ndo not neglect the role of their nations in reaching the \r\ndevelopment that they seek. They do not absolve the \r\nWest of its misdeeds, but they are also aware of their \r\nown failings. Those leaders can assume positions of \r\nactive leadership by attracting the confidence of the \r\npeople in their societies and can establish the strongest \r\nnational and international coalitions against violence.\r\nThe voices of such leaders are the true voices of \r\nmoderation in the Islamic world. They represent the \r\nfamiliar voice of an Afghan weary of war, of an Iraqi \r\nvictim of extremism, of a Syrian fearful of terrorism and \r\nof a Lebanese worried about violence and sectarianism. \r\nI believe that if countries that claim to lead the coalition \r\ndo so to continue their hegemony in the region, they \r\nare making a strategic mistake. Obviously, since the \r\npain is better known by the countries of the region, \r\nthose countries can better form a coalition and agree to \r\nshoulder the responsibility of leadership in countering \r\nviolence and terrorism. If other nations wish to take \r\naction against terrorism, they must come to their support. \r\nI warn that if we do not muster all our strengths against \r\nextremism and violence, and if we fail to entrust the \r\ntask to those in the region who can succeed, tomorrow \r\nthe world will not be safe for anyone.\r\nLast year I tried to fulfil my country’s role in \r\nthe realization of peace at both the regional and \r\ninternational levels by putting forward a proposal about \r\na world against violence and extremism, which met with \r\ngeneral support. In the tumultuous and chaotic region \r\nof the Middle East, Iran is one of the most tranquil, \r\nsecure and stable nations. All the nations of the region \r\nhave to keep in mind that we are in the same boat. \r\nThus, we need broad cooperation with regard to social \r\nand political issues, as well as security and defence \r\nissues, with a view to reaching common and durable \r\nunderstandings. Had we had greater cooperation and \r\ncoordination in the Middle East, thousands of innocent \r\nPalestinians in Gaza would not have fallen victim to the \r\naggressions of the Zionist regime.\r\nWe in the Islamic Republic of Iran consider \r\ninteraction and confidence-building among the States \r\nof the region as fundamentally essential for conflict \r\nresolution. We support any measure to promote \r\ncooperation among Islamic nations to combat extremism \r\nand threats and aggression, and in that connection we \r\nare prepared to play our permanent constructive and \r\npositive role.\r\nThe oppressive sanctions against Iran go on, in \r\ncontinuation of a strategic mistake against a moderate \r\nand independent nation in the current sensitive \r\nconditions in our region. During the past year, we have \r\nengaged in the most transparent possible dialogue to \r\nbuild confidence regarding Iran’s peaceful nuclear \r\nprogramme. We placed serious and honest negotiations \r\non the agenda, not as a result of sanctions or threats but \r\nrather because of the will of our people. We are of the \r\nview that the nuclear issue can be resolved only through \r\nnegotiation, and those who may think of other solutions \r\nwould be commiting a grave mistake. Any delay in \r\nreaching final agreement only raises the costs — not \r\nonly for us but also for the economies and trade of \r\nthe other parties, as well as for the development and \r\nsecurity prospects of our region. No one should doubt \r\nthat compromise and agreement on that issue are in \r\neveryone’s best interest, especially that of the nations \r\nof the region.\r\nThe nuclear negotiations between Iran and the 5+1 \r\nGroup have continued during the past year and the past \r\nfew months, with seriousness and optimism on both \r\nsides. According to all international observers, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran has carried out its commitments \r\nin good faith. Although some of the observations and \r\nactions of our counterparts have created certain doubts \r\nregarding their determination and realism, we hope that \r\nthe current negotiations will lead to a final accord in \r\nthe short time that remains.\r\n12/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nWe are committed to continuing our peaceful \r\nnuclear programme, including enrichment, and to \r\nenjoy our full nuclear rights on Iranian soil within the \r\nframework of international law. We are determined to \r\ncontinue negotiations with our interlocutors in earnest \r\ngood faith and on an equal footing, based on mutual \r\nrespect and confidence and on recognized international \r\nnorms and principles, removing concerns of both \r\nsides. I believe that mutual adherence to the strict \r\nimplementation of commitments and obligations and \r\navoidance of excessive demands in the negotiations by \r\nour counterparts are the prerequisites for the success \r\nof the negotiations. A final accord regarding Iran’s \r\npeaceful nuclear programme can serve as the beginning \r\nof multilateral collaboration aimed at promoting \r\nsecurity, peace and development in our region and \r\nbeyond.\r\nThe people of Iran, who have been subjected to \r\npressures especially during the past three years as a \r\nresult of continued sanctions, cannot trust any security \r\ncooperation between their Government and those \r\nwho have imposed sanctions and created obstacles to \r\ntheir ability to satisfy even their primary needs, such \r\nas food and medicine. Sanctions only create further \r\nimpediments to long-term cooperation in the future. \r\nThe people of Iran are devoted to certain principles \r\nand values, at the apex of which are independence, \r\ndevelopment and national pride. If that obvious fact \r\nabout the nation is not understood by our negotiating \r\npartners and they commit grievous miscalculations in \r\nthe process, a historic and exceptional opportunity will \r\nbe lost.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, during the ongoing nuclear \r\nnegotiations this year, the Iranian Government took \r\nsome initiatives that created favourable conditions, \r\nwhich resulted in the new phase, the Geneva Joint \r\nPlan of Action. We are determined to continue our \r\nconfidence-building approach and transparency in \r\nthat process. If our interlocutors are equally motivated \r\nand f lexible, and if we can overcome the problems \r\nand reach long-standing agreement within the time \r\nremaining, then an entirely different environment will \r\nemerge for cooperation at the regional and international \r\nlevels. That would allow for greater focus on some very \r\nimportant regional issues such as combating violence \r\nand extremism in the region.\r\nMrs. Al-Mughairy (Oman), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nArriving at a final, comprehensive nuclear \r\nagreement with Iran will be an historic opportunity for \r\nthe West to show that it does not oppose the advancement \r\nand development of others and does not discriminate \r\nwhen it comes to adhering to international rules and \r\nregulations. Such an agreement could bear a global \r\nmessage of peace and security, indicating that the only \r\nway to attain conflict resolution is through negotiation \r\nand respect, not through conflict and sanctions.\r\nLast year, the great nation of Iran broadly \r\nparticipated in the calm and impressive presidential \r\nelection and endorsed the discourse of foresight, hope \r\nand prudent moderation. Thereafter, they support their \r\nelected Government in its effort in building the country. \r\nWhile some of Iran’s neighbours have fallen prey to \r\nwar and turmoil, Iran remains secure, stable and calm.\r\nMy Government’s principled policy is to work \r\ntowards constructive interactions with our neighbors \r\non the basis of mutual respect and with emphasis on \r\ncommon interests. The notion that Iran seeks to control \r\nother Muslim countries in the region is a myth fanned \r\nin recent years in the context of an Iranophobic project. \r\nThose who make such claims need imaginary enemies \r\nto sustain tensions and sow division and conflict, \r\nthereby pushing for the redeployment of national \r\nresources away from development. We work to put an \r\nend to delusional Iranophobia, setting the stage for \r\nbuilding strategic partnerships with our neighbours.\r\nLast year I warned against the expansion of violence \r\nand extremism. This year too I warn that if the right \r\napproach is not taken in dealing with the issue at hand, \r\nwe will get closer to having a turbulent and tumultuous \r\nregion with repercussions for the whole world. The \r\nright solution to that quandary comes from within \r\nthe region, not from outside, and must be a regionally \r\nprovided solution with international support.\r\nIn the Holy Koran, God the Almighty has promised \r\nthose who have believed and done righteous deeds that \r\nHe will surely grant them succession to authority upon \r\nthe Earth and that their fears will turn into peace and \r\nsecurity. It is my sincerest hope that our generation will \r\nendeavour to leave a more secure and developed Earth \r\nas its legacy for the next generation. I wish all present \r\nmuch success and many blessings.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran for the statement he has just made.\r\n14-54841 13/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mohamed Moncef Marzouki, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Tunisia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nTunisia.\r\nMr. Mohamed Moncef Marzouki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Moncef \r\nMarzouki, President of the Republic of Tunisia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Marzouki (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend my warm congratulations \r\nto Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, representative of the \r\nfriendly nation of Uganda, on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. I would also like to express my thanks and \r\nappreciation to Mr. John Ashe and his team, as well as \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\r\nIn this world, where a surfeit of bad news \r\novershadows the good work of creativity, reform \r\nand recovery, we continue our peaceful transition to \r\ndemocracy. We have managed to eliminate a dictatorial \r\nregime at the least possible human cost. We have begun \r\na difficult transitional stage with a comprehensive \r\nnational dialogue, and we have written a consensual \r\nconstitution and built democratic State institutions. \r\nWe are now preparing for legislative and presidential \r\nelections to be held before the end of the year in order \r\nto transform Tunisia into a stable, democratic, forward-\r\nlooking State. Internal and external forces continue to \r\nundermine our democratic, peaceful transition through \r\nterrorist acts and political assassinations. However, our \r\npeople are resolved to pursue their efforts to achieve \r\nsuccess, despite the aggression of diabolical forces.\r\nTunisia today is a test for a peaceful democratic \r\ntransition in an Arab country that lived for too long under \r\ndespotism. We are attempting to reconcile democracy \r\nand political Islam. We are pursuing an ongoing national \r\ndialogue. We are distributing authority between secular \r\nmodernists and Islamists. We are using moderation to \r\ngrapple with the counter-revolution and to eliminate \r\nthe residues of despotism through a just transition. We \r\nare also testing new socioeconomic approaches. We are \r\npromoting comprehensive development initiatives that \r\nwill combat poverty and that will be in harmony with \r\nthe environment. We have a broader social vision in line \r\nwith the policies and vision of the United Nations with \r\nregard to addressing global warming, climate change \r\nand the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, as \r\nwell as the Secretary-General’s Global Education First \r\nInitiative. We are also committed to our own policies \r\nthat aim to achieve world peace, especially within the \r\nArab world to which we belong, and on the African \r\ncontinent, where we seek to definitively overcome the \r\npast and look to the future.\r\nTunisia’s development process is unfolding in the \r\nheart of a region that is currently witnessing political \r\nupheavals that, in some cases, have had painful \r\nconsequences for us too. Transnational radical armed \r\ngroups have since the beginning of the revolution  been \r\ntargeting us and have killed many of our soldiers and \r\nsecurity personnel, hindering our security apparatus \r\nin an attempt to abort the drive for democracy and \r\nto impose alternatives rejected by the majority of our \r\npeople.\r\nThe volatile situation in Libya is cause for concern \r\nbecause the stability of that sister neighbouring \r\ncountry affects our own stability. We hope that the \r\nLibyans will, through national  dialogue, achieve an \r\nadvanced, democratic stable State without outside \r\nmilitary intervention, which would only add insult \r\nto injury. We encourage the wise men of Libya, both \r\nwithin and outside that country, to preserve broad \r\nnational consensus and the security, unity, stability and \r\nprosperity of their country through a peaceful, political \r\nsolution. We hope from the bottom of our hearts that \r\nour brothers will manage to achieve that.\r\nWe are concerned by the spread of violence \r\non the eastern front of the Arab world, which has \r\nreached unprecedented levels of brutality, including \r\ndecapitation, the chopping off of hands and the \r\nexecution of prisoners. We are appalled by such \r\nviolence and attacks on our Christian brothers and \r\nother religious minorities, who form an integral part \r\nof our Arab and Islamic heritage and culture. We are \r\nashamed of such practices in the name of our Allah, \r\nwho defines himself as the compassionate and the \r\nmerciful. According to the Koran, whoever kills an \r\ninnocent soul kills all humankind, and whoever gives a \r\nnew life to such a person saves all humankind. That has \r\n14/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nhappened all too frequently of late. Nothing can justify \r\nthe indiscriminate violence at such unprecedented and \r\nhorrific levels. We condemn the execution of prisoners, \r\nbe they Arab, Muslim, French, American or British. We \r\nare all human beings and belong to one human family. \r\nWe seek to understand this phenomenon so as to be able \r\nto address its root causes.\r\nThe violence and counter-violence we are \r\nwitnessing today are the cumulative result of five \r\ndecades of misguided policies of despotism that denied \r\npeople their rights and basic freedoms, distributed \r\nwealth to some and consigned others to poverty. Such \r\npolicies, which have exploited religion in the service \r\nof politics, are like magic that has now turned against \r\nthe magician. They run counter to Arab and Islamic \r\ncivilization. The problem cannot be solved by entrusting \r\nit to the police and army. The situation demands bold \r\npolicies that take into account all those levels and that \r\nestablishes regimes that are in harmony with their \r\npeople. All political prisoners should be released and \r\nthere should be an ongoing national dialogue with the \r\nparticipation of all moderate political sectors that are \r\ncommitted to peace. The economy needs to serve the \r\ninterests of the majority, with an emphasis on advanced \r\neducation under the banner of freedom and respect for \r\nthe values of the Arab and Muslim countries. Only such \r\npolicies will lead to united, peace-abiding societies. \r\nOur people yearn to improve their standard of living \r\nand to broaden the vistas for future generations.\r\nFor many decades, some of the major Powers \r\nsupported despotic regimes in our country on the \r\npretext of maintaining stability. If the same problems \r\nare not to be repeated, they must help to achieve internal \r\nreconciliation. Resorting to military solutions may lead \r\nto meaningless wars that could endanger the whole \r\nworld. We therefore strongly call for the blockade of \r\nGaza to be lifted in order to enable it to build a port and \r\nairport, and not just to open the border crossings but also \r\nto fulfil the political right of the Palestinian people to a \r\ngeographically contiguous, secure, independent State, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. The Gazans who are \r\nliving without shelter are pleading to our consciences \r\nfor the reconstruction of Gaza and return children to \r\ntheir destroyed schools’ classrooms and playgrounds. \r\nWe pray to God to end the nightmare engulfing the \r\npeople of Syria through the banishment of its dictator \r\nand the formation of a Government of national unity.\r\nTunisia, as a Member of the United Nations, \r\nunderstands how important it is that the Organization \r\nbe capable of dealing with such huge global changes. \r\nWe support the granting of permanent membership in \r\nthe Security Council to Brazil, Germany, Japan and \r\nIndia, to be followed by permanent-member status for \r\nan African country, to enable it to deal with the world \r\nof today, which is no longer that which existed at the \r\nend of the Second World War. That war ended with \r\nthe defeat of fascism, dictatorship and Nazism and, \r\neventually, Communist totalitarianism. While so much \r\nof today’s world has been democratizing so rapidly, it \r\nis now threatened with climate, economic and political \r\nproblems. To deal with them, every country must \r\npreserve its gains and create the machinery needed for \r\nprevention, protection and commitment.\r\nIt is good that we have the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for punishing despots who abuse their \r\npeoples’ rights; we should also have a tool that prevents \r\nthem from surviving and staying in power. Tunisia \r\nhas therefore proposed establishing an international \r\nconstitutional court that could advise all liberated \r\npeoples and hand down decisions on illegitimate, \r\nbogus elections that lead to Government by force, \r\nwhich clearly runs contrary to international legitimacy \r\nand the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This \r\nidea has been well received in academic circles and \r\ninternational symposiums. We reiterate our call for \r\nsupport for such democratic institutions so that this \r\nproposal can be presented to the Legal Committee.\r\nWe hope that an international court such as this can \r\nbe realized and could enable us to deter despots, support \r\nfreedom and democracy and eradicate the sources \r\nof violence and conflicts among peoples. I hope that \r\nestablishing such a court will not require the decades \r\nthat it took to bring about the birth of the ICC, and we \r\nhope that Tunis, our capital, can have the honour of \r\nhosting one of the United Nations institutions that have \r\nso far been the preserve of the advanced countries of \r\nthe northern hemisphere. It is high time to give some \r\nthought to allowing the liberated cities of the South to \r\nhost such institutions.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Tunisia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mohamed Moncef Marzouki, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n14-54841 15/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nColombia.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst, on behalf of the Government of Colombia, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Kutesa for his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly and to express \r\nColombia’s support for his work in promoting a post-\r\n2015 development agenda that responds to humankind’s \r\ncurrent challenges. The sustainable development \r\ngoals recently adopted after an open, transparent and \r\ninclusive negotiation process should be at the centre of \r\nthat agenda.\r\nIn a world full of bad news, war, terrorism and \r\ndisease, I would like to bring a ray of hope to the \r\nAssembly: that, after more than half a century of \r\nconflict, Colombia will soon enjoy peace. If we achieve \r\nthis goal, which Colombians have unsuccessfully \r\nsought for so long, there is hope for peace anywhere in \r\nthe world, despite how difficult things may seem right \r\nnow. Today, I can say to the international community \r\nthat we are closer than ever before to achieving that \r\npeace. The process that has been taking place in \r\nHavana over the past two years with the guerrilla group \r\nknown as the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de \r\nColombia (FARC) has been serious, realistic, credible \r\nand effective and has produced concrete results.\r\nWe agreed on an agenda with five substantive \r\npoints, of which we have achieved agreements on \r\nthree: comprehensive rural development, political \r\nparticipation and the illicit drug problem. In the first \r\nof those areas, we have agreed to unprecedented \r\ninvestment in agricultural development, working to \r\ngive farmers access to land and to generate a better \r\nstandard of living for farming families. Regarding \r\npolitical participation, what we are striving for is very \r\nsimple. We want to broaden our democracy in order \r\nto build peace and promote citizen participation, and \r\nto forever sever the link between politics and arms. \r\nRegarding the illicit drug problem, we have agreed \r\nto continue dismantling the drug mafia structures, \r\npromote a national crop substitution and alternative \r\ndevelopment programme and address the issue of \r\nconsumption from a public health perspective. The \r\nagreement also includes a commitment on the part \r\nof FARC to contributing effectively to a definitive \r\nsolution to the illicit drug problem and to ending any \r\nrelationship it may have had with it.\r\nA Colombia without coca and without conflict \r\nwas an impossible dream just a few years or decades \r\nago. Today, I can affirm that it is a real possibility. \r\nWe have already begun discussions on the last two \r\nsubstantive points of the plan: the victims and the end \r\nof the conflict. This war has left in its wake millions of \r\nvictims who never had a voice before and who are now \r\nat the centre of the process. We are working to fulfil \r\nthe rights of victims to justice, truth, reparations and \r\nnon-recurrence. Above all, we are working to ensure \r\nthat there are no more victims.\r\nIn an act that I believe to be without precedent in \r\nthe history of the world, representatives of the victims \r\nare explaining their situations, exposing their pain and \r\nsetting out their expectations before the Government \r\nand guerrillas. The victims are the main protagonists \r\nand the main beneficiaries of the peace that we seek. \r\nConstanza Turbay, who represents the courage of our \r\nwomen and who lost most of her family at the hands \r\nof the guerrillas, had the opportunity to confront her \r\nvictimizers, look them in the eye and to directly hear \r\ntheir expressions of sincere remorse. In her own words, \r\nMs. Turbay stated that the victims are “replacing \r\ntheir pain with the hope of peace”. Another woman, \r\nMs. Juanita Barragan, who spent several years of her \r\nyouth within the ranks of the FARC, was able to tell her \r\nformer leaders in Havana: “Please do not enlist more \r\nchildren to fight your war”. Today, Ms. Barragan wants \r\nto be a lawyer and to work for children. There are so \r\nmany cases and so many voices that are finally being \r\nheard.\r\nWe have also created a subcommittee that \r\nincludes active military and police personnel. This \r\nsubcommittee is beginning to consider the details of \r\na definitive bilateral ceasefire process, as well as the \r\ndemobilization and disarmament of guerrillas upon \r\nsignature of the final agreement. I can therefore now \r\nreport to the international community that Colombia has \r\nmade substantial progress in its effort to end the armed \r\n16/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nconflict that has affected us to such a great extent, and, \r\ninevitably, impacted the region and the world.\r\nWhen the post-conflict phase begins, we will face \r\nimmense challenges in reintegrating those who have \r\ndemobilized, ensuring a State presence in conflict-\r\naffected areas, and guaranteeing civic security. \r\nThe support and contributions of the international \r\ncommunity are key in that regard, and we call for \r\nthat support. I take this opportunity to express \r\nour gratitude to the many nations and multilateral \r\nagencies — especially the United Nations — for their \r\ncommitment to the peace process and their willingness \r\nto provide all manner of support, not only now but also \r\nin the future as we implement those agreements in the \r\npost-conflict stage.\r\nIn my inaugural speech upon taking office for a \r\nsecond term as President of Colombia on 7 August, \r\nI stated the following, and repeat it today before the \r\nworld’s nations. While conflicts rage around the world, \r\nColombia aspires to bring the good news for humankind \r\nthat the final armed conflict in the western hemisphere \r\nis coming to an end. If we are successful, as we truly \r\nexpect to be, we will be ready to share our experience \r\nwith other countries. We are sure that our case can \r\nbecome a model and a beacon of hope for the world’s \r\nother conflicts.\r\nIn Colombia, we seek peace because the suffering \r\nof our fellow citizens pains us. We do not want any \r\nmore victims, or women or children involved in war. \r\nWe therefore understand the pain of and express our \r\nsolidarity with the many nations that today are suffering \r\nfrom war and unutterable atrocities, due — it must be \r\nsaid — to the impotence of the international community \r\nWe are not oblivious to the suffering of those who \r\nlive in such countries such as Syria, Iraq, Libya and \r\nUkraine and in regions like the Sahel. We condemn \r\nthe ruthless terrorism of the Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nthe Sham. We are not indifferent to the suffering of the \r\nmany families in Palestine and Israel who are victims \r\nof armed confrontations, or to the loss of life due to \r\nepidemics, such as Ebola in Africa.\r\nAs we approach the Organization’s seventieth \r\nanniversary, we find ourselves at a defining moment in \r\nthe consolidation of the international system embodied \r\nby the United Nations. Full respect for international \r\nlaw and the purposes and principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter is essential to attaining lasting solutions to \r\novercome conflict and achieve progress in fulfilling the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the people. In confrontations, \r\nwe must restore the ethical principles that are \r\nfundamental to the human condition, and children, \r\nwomen and civilians must be spared such tragedies.\r\nColombia favours negotiated political solutions. \r\nToday, we must ask questions that are not only rhetorical \r\nbut also true. Why are there people who stand against \r\npeace? Why do some see war as the only way out? \r\nPerhaps they do so because without war they would lose \r\ntheir power, accustomed as they are to making a living \r\nand profiting from it, and unable as they are to imagine \r\nlife without it. We have to convince the promoters of \r\nwar that this is not the way, and convert them into \r\npromoters of peace. We are doing just that in Colombia, \r\nand we must do the same in every corner of the planet. \r\nThe United Nations was established precisely to prevent \r\nconflict and to seek peace.\r\nUndoubtedly, the drug trade and drug trafficking \r\nare fuelling the conflicts in Colombia and elsewhere in \r\nthe world. Colombia has promoted a serious, technical \r\nand objective discussion of the methods and results \r\nof the so-called war on drugs. This war has not been \r\nwon, but we have had some success at the hemispheric \r\nlevel. Last week, at the Special General Assembly of \r\nthe Organization of American States in Guatemala, we \r\nachieved hemispheric consensus on several positions \r\nand adopted a resolution that shows that we can move \r\nforward together on this issue. Those results will help \r\nus to be more prepared to be able to achieve progress \r\nat the United Nations special session on drugs that has \r\nbeen called for 2016.\r\nLast month, in the inaugural speech of my second \r\nmandate, I set out for Colombians the vision that will \r\nguide our actions. I want to make Colombia a country \r\nof peace, a country with equality, and the most educated \r\ncountry in Latin America by 2025. At the same time, \r\nthis vision also draws us towards the future sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals for the post-2015 period — ambitious \r\ngoals that address humankind’s most pressing social, \r\neconomic and environmental problems.\r\nThe good economic climate that Colombia is \r\nexperiencing, progress in the social indicators, \r\nparticularly poverty reduction and job creation, and the \r\npeace process itself allow us to believe in the possibility \r\nof achieving this vision. It is this Colombia, the one \r\nthat is overcoming poverty, has regained control of its \r\nterritory, is growing at the world’s highest levels and \r\n14-54841 17/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nhas successful social equality policies in order to find \r\nmore fairness, which is also searching for peace.\r\nI envisage the same things for Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean as I envisage for my country — that \r\nwe can be a region at peace, with greater equality and \r\nbetter education; a region that makes the transition \r\nfrom resource-based economies to knowledge-based \r\neconomies; a region in which entrepreneurship and \r\ninnovation are the engines of development; a region with \r\nsocially and environmentally responsible companies \r\nthat transform our future.\r\nAs I said in the Assembly in 2010 (see A/65/PV.15), \r\nthis should be the decade of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. And now, before the world’s nations, \r\nI reiterate the call on my region, Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean, to remain true to that intention. To the \r\ninternational community, I make an impassioned appeal \r\nfor us to put everything we can — everything — into \r\nensuring that the sense of humanity overcomes war. We \r\nare losing our way when we look at the tragedies that \r\nhumankind is suffering without being pained by them, \r\nwithout the world waking up and taking decisive action \r\nto address them. We cannot allow ourselves to lose the \r\ncapacity to be shocked by war. It is time to wake up. It \r\nis time to act.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Colombia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Hery Martial \r\nRajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, President \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana \r\n(spoke in French): Like my predecessors, I would like \r\nfirst of all, on behalf of the delegation of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar and on my own behalf, to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. He is a credit to his country, the Republic of \r\nUganda, and the pride of the entire African continent.\r\nAllow me next to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his commitment to peace and development \r\nin the world and for his actions at the head of the \r\nOrganization. I also take this opportunity to solemnly \r\nreiterate to him and his team the gratitude of the \r\nMalagasy people for the special attention and resources \r\nthat the United Nations system has mobilized in order \r\nto contribute to the culmination of the process that \r\nbrought the crisis in Madagascar to an end. We are also \r\ngrateful for the important role that the United Nations \r\ncontinues to play in working together with Madagascar \r\nand its people. I naturally extend that gratitude to the \r\nentire international community, whose support has \r\nbeen decisive in the peaceful resolution of the Malagasy \r\ncrisis.\r\nBy choosing to return to constitutional order \r\nthrough the ballot box, the Malagasy people confirmed \r\nits commitment to stability and security. In so doing, it is \r\nparticipating in building peace and security in the region \r\nand thus throughout the world. Strengthened by those \r\nvalues , we have made national reconciliation, which \r\nis the foundation of social cohesion, the cornerstone \r\nof our development policy. We are convinced that \r\nwithout social peace, there can be no development and \r\nvice versa. We have already taken important steps in \r\nthat process and we intend to move forward. But our \r\nresources are not yet commensurate with the scale of \r\nthe tasks that remain. That is why Madagascar wishes \r\nto gain access to the Peacebuilding Fund, which is \r\nbeing made available through the Organization.\r\nFive per cent of the world’s biodiversity is found \r\nin Madagascar. It behoves us, therefore, to take \r\nresponsibility for preserving that resource and ensure \r\nbetter management for future generations. Upon taking \r\noffice in January 2014, I declared war on traffickers \r\nin rosewood and all those who engage in the illegal \r\ntrade in protected species. The establishment of good \r\nforest governance was the first act in a whole series \r\n18/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nof concrete measures to that end. An interdepartmental \r\ncommittee for restructuring the sector was established. \r\nThe authorities are working hard to achieve the policy \r\nof zero tolerance against trafficking of all kinds related \r\nto natural resources and protected species. However, \r\ndespite our efforts, we must note that traffickers still \r\nmanage to evade surveillance measures, due to the lack \r\nof resources at our disposal to deal with traffickers, \r\nwho have ample resources.\r\nMadagascar’s strategic location in the Indian \r\nOcean, at the crossroads of various maritime routes \r\nthat are vital to global trade, means that we must work \r\nto preserve our fishing areas and our marine reserves. \r\nThe risk of piracy, terrorism and trafficking of all kinds \r\nis high. Measures must be taken in that regard, within \r\nthe framework of an active international cooperation to \r\nprotect the area.\r\nThe Malagasy Government has also increased the \r\nextent of protected areas to cover more than 10 per cent \r\nof the country, or at least 6 million hectares, with the \r\ncooperation of its partners. A large-scale reforestation \r\nproject aimed at sustaining the long-term production of \r\ntimber and firewood is included in the Government’s \r\nagenda in terms of commitments. We are also \r\nstrengthening our legal arsenal by ratifying several \r\nmultilateral environmental agreements, including the \r\nDoha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the Minamata Convention on Mercury.\r\nAfter over five years of political crisis, including \r\nsanctions and suspension measures of all kinds, it is \r\nclear that the majority of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals will not be met in Madagascar by 2015. However, \r\nthe country is committed to focusing its development \r\nefforts on its population and has initiated major \r\nprojects in some key sectors such as education, health, \r\nemployment, security, access to new information and \r\ncommunication technologies and infrastructure. Thus, \r\nschool enrolment for girls has far exceeded that for \r\nboys. Similarly, nearly 500,000 children and youth have \r\nbeen enrolled in educational and socio-professional \r\ninstitutions for the year 2014-2015. Over 100 basic \r\nhealth centres have been opened in recent months \r\nacross the country. In the framework of our fight against \r\nmalaria, Madagascar’s efforts have been recognized \r\nat the continental level, including our achievement of \r\n95 per cent of households owning at least one mosquito \r\nnet impregnated with long-lasting insecticide and our \r\nintra-residential spraying campaign, which are the most \r\nimportant tools for the prevention of malaria. Moreover, \r\nMadagascar has demonstrated its solidarity with the \r\nworld’s fight against Ebola.\r\nIn terms of security, tangible results have been \r\nachieved in recent months with Operation First Strike, \r\nwhich is aimed at eradicating the massive theft of \r\nzebus in the south and west of the country. Finally, \r\nMadagascar’s renewed adherence to the African \r\nGrowth and Opportunity Act should give new impetus \r\nto the country’s economic and social fabric with the \r\nmassive job creation.\r\nWhen it comes to climate change, the stakes are \r\nhigh for Madagascar, since our economy is based on \r\ndeveloping sectors that are sensitive to climate change. \r\nThe numbers are telling in that regard — 75 per cent \r\nof Madagascar’s population lives in rural areas, of \r\nwhich 4 million are in vulnerable areas, and 28 per cent \r\nof the rural population are food-insecure. Although \r\nwe do not have the means to adequately mitigate the \r\nnegative effects of climate change on the country’s \r\nsocio-economic activities, we have nevertheless taken \r\naction. Measures range from the development of legal \r\nframeworks such as the national policy for the fight \r\nagainst climate change, the national strategy for a \r\nclean development mechanism and the establishment of \r\nan energy transition policy that is based on the use of \r\nrenewable energy. We are also implementing a national \r\naction plan for adaptation and have created various \r\nstructures to coordinate activities related to climate \r\nchange.\r\nWe fully support the theme of this session, \r\n“Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-\r\n2015 development agenda”. Our country is committed \r\nto creating the conditions to establish a prosperous and \r\nmodern nation. That is the whole purpose of the actions \r\nwe have undertaken on the basis of the principles of \r\ntransparency, good governance, respect for the rights of \r\nothers, democracy and human rights. With this vision \r\nof a modern and prosperous nation, our main objective \r\nis to allow the people to emerge from their precarious \r\nsituation. To do so, we have decided on a policy of \r\nimproving production to increase productivity and \r\ndeveloping a reliable agricultural sector. That will help \r\nthe country to achieve food self-sufficiency and allow \r\nMadagascar to become the backbone of food security in \r\nthe Indian Ocean.\r\nWe have also decided to undertake major public \r\ninfrastructure works, including structural work, the \r\nconstruction of highways and roads, works of art, \r\n14-54841 19/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nbuilding construction and embellishment, dams, \r\nwater purification and improvements to the energy \r\nsector. In that regard, we are developing an innovative \r\npartnership for finance structuring and partnerships. \r\nIn addition to conventional financing from traditional \r\ndonors, we have used a public-private partnership \r\nsystem. It is aimed at establishing a mutually beneficial \r\npartnership for Malagasy and investors alike. Particular \r\nattention is being paid to promoting youth employment, \r\nand companies that fulfil the required conditions will \r\nbenefit from strong incentives and tax benefits.\r\nAnother priority area is tourism. Tourist facilities \r\nare still limited in number and need to be developed. \r\nMadagascar today is the ideal destination for such \r\ninvestment, in particular in growth sectors. We \r\nmust meet the challenges of growth and ensure that \r\nGovernment actions have a positive and tangible \r\nimpact on the lives of the 22 million Malagasy through \r\ninclusive and sustainable development. Madagascar \r\nhas adopted a transformative agenda for its future. The \r\ndrafting of the national development plan reflects the \r\ndetermination of the State to establish the principles \r\nof good governance and economic recovery. The Plan \r\nis to be a central frame of reference for private-sector \r\nengagement with civil society, decentralized local \r\nauthorities and technical and financial partners. The \r\nimplementation of the national development plan will \r\npromote and ensure the security of domestic and foreign \r\ninvestment and the updating of regulatory frameworks \r\nrelating thereto.\r\nBefore concluding, I reiterate my country’s \r\ndetermination to renew and strengthen its commitments \r\nto the various activities of the United Nations, in \r\naddition to our effective participation in the regular \r\nwork of the committees and in various conferences \r\nheld under the auspices of the Organization. We point \r\nout the deployment every year of contingents from our \r\nnational gendarmerie, national police and the Malagasy \r\npenitentiary administration within various United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Africa. Most \r\nrecently, the Government of Madagascar has responded \r\npositively to the United Nations request for 140 officers \r\nin formed police units to serve in the Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African \r\nRepublic.\r\nMs. Rambally (Saint Lucia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nMadagascar also continues to advocate for equitable \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council so that countries \r\ndirectly involved in crises and conflicts can fully take \r\npart in the process of the adoption of resolutions.\r\nMadagascar aspires to move rapidly from its current \r\nstatus to that of a growing country with an expanding, \r\nvibrant middle class and that will see its income quickly \r\nrise to match those of emerging countries. I know that \r\nthis is possible and achievable. I have made a moral \r\ncontract with the people of Madagascar to optimize our \r\nuse of our natural and human resources to enable our \r\ncountry to achieve a solid place within the globalization \r\nnetwork, to rebuild itself and to contribute in a positive \r\nway to the resolution of the major problems of this \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampiania \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ivo Josipović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia.\r\nMr. Ivo Josipović, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ivo Josipović, President of \r\nthe Republic of Croatia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Josipović: The topic of this general debate, \r\n“Delivering on and implementing a transformative post-\r\n2015 development agenda”, most fittingly depicts our \r\ncommon priority before the Organization’s seventieth \r\nanniversary next autumn. We are about to set the stage \r\nfor strategic decisions and concrete actions that should \r\ndeliver comprehensive and transformational changes at \r\nthe global and national levels.\r\nWars and armed conflicts, natural diseases, \r\npandemic diseases, lingering poverty and many other \r\nexisting or potential threats to human lives and human \r\nrights keep on emerging. If we do not react adamantly \r\nand swiftly to tackle those perils early enough in their \r\n20/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nemerging phases, we run the risk that they will increase \r\nexponentially and beyond our control. More than ever \r\nbefore, we must face the fact that security, development \r\nand human rights are interdependent and mutually \r\nreinforcing. They demand to be at the very heart of the \r\npost-2015 agenda.\r\nAt this time, we are also witnessing a type of \r\ndangerous discord that spreads a fear of the worst \r\npossible outcome — the same kind of fear that preceded \r\nthe birth of the Organization. The Charter of the United \r\nNations provides us with so much wisdom; its words \r\ncame with the experience of the scourge of war and \r\nmisery. What we need at this point is to reinvigorate \r\nthe same level of determination we had almost seven \r\ndecades ago and to do everything we can to avoid \r\nregression.\r\nCroatia is deeply concerned about the situation \r\nin Ukraine. There is none but a peaceful solution \r\nto the conflict. The suffering of so many people is \r\nunfortunately all too familiar. Croatia echoes the call \r\nto stop the violence and to reach a political solution. \r\nCroatia strongly supports the principles of international \r\nlaw concerning the sovereignty and territorial integrity \r\nof Ukraine.\r\nSimilarly, we share the grave concern over the \r\nterrorism and violence spreading around the world, \r\nmost notably in the Middle East and Africa. The \r\nsheer magnitude of destruction, the loss of lives and \r\nunspeakable atrocities, most notably those committed \r\nby the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham, can be \r\novershadowed only by the growing threat that they \r\nwill not stop soon or at any border, and that they will \r\ncontinue to grow and devour everything our civilization \r\nstands for. A zero-tolerance policy towards terrorism \r\nand a joint global effort are needed to prevent that from \r\nhappening. Croatia supports all ongoing efforts to form \r\na coalition against the so-called Islamic State. We stand \r\nready to make a contribution to Iraqi and Iraqi Kurdish \r\nforces.\r\nAlso, although it is a difficult task, achieving \r\na stable and sustainable peace agreement between \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians is an imperative. We hope that \r\nhonest and serious efforts will be resumed to negotiate \r\na comprehensive and sustainable peace agreement that \r\nwill establish the grounds for a two-State solution, \r\nliving in peace and security, mutually recognizing \r\nand respecting each other, and gradually transforming \r\nthe entire Middle East into a region of peace and \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe situation in the world brings the need for \r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nto the centre of our attention. In that regard, the \r\n2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons will \r\nbe of particular importance, and Croatia hopes that \r\nthe Treaty will be reinforced and strengthened as an \r\noutcome of the Conference. Croatia also commends \r\nthe unprecedented international effort aimed at the \r\ndestruction of the chemical weapons of the Syrian \r\nArab Republic. The Organization for the Prohibition \r\nof Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Mission’s \r\nsuccessful work demonstrates the indispensable role of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIt is truly unnerving to be confronted with the \r\nproblems and crises that I have mentioned, while our \r\nvery best effort is needed to overcome obstacles such as \r\nclimate change, natural disasters and the scarcity and \r\ndegradation of resources, especially food and drinking \r\nwater. The crises are interlinked. Therefore, we need an \r\ninterlinked and integrated response to them. Again, no \r\nserious thought can be given to sustainable development \r\nwithout ensuring peace and security.\r\nSome conflicts could have been foreseen, prevented \r\nand even averted if the international community had \r\nacted in a timely and decisive way. While, indeed, the \r\nprimary responsibility lies with the sovereign State \r\nitself, regional and global organizations have the tools, \r\nand therefore also the obligation, to assist those States. \r\nOne effective method in that regard is peacebuilding, \r\nwhere we help post-conflict societies to stand on \r\ntheir own. There is a vast pool of global experience in \r\npeacebuilding that could be applied, including that of \r\nmy own country. We therefore hope that the upcoming \r\nreview of the United Nations peacebuilding architecture \r\nwill consolidate the existing knowledge and experience \r\nand bring fresh ideas as to how to improve the overall \r\npeacebuilding process.\r\nA special role in maintaining peace and advancing \r\ndevelopment lies with women. In particular, we see \r\nthe role of women in achieving successful conflict \r\nresolution and the sustainable development of post-\r\nconflict societies. We strongly advocate women’s \r\neconomic empowerment for peacebuilding and \r\ndevelopment. That is why we are organizing a high-\r\nlevel meeting at United Nations Headquarters on the \r\ngender dimension of sustainable development within \r\nthe context of post-conflict recovery on 26 September.\r\n14-54841 21/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nThis week, we started discussing climate \r\nchange — the pressing issue of today. Croatia is as \r\nvulnerable as any other country. The devastating and \r\nunprecedented f loods that we are witnessing now \r\nare proof of that. Yesterday, we all renewed our vow \r\nto boldly and ambitiously tackle that global issue, \r\nwhich is clearly of great importance. Croatia hopes \r\nthat the upcoming Lima and Paris conferences will \r\nlead us to a global agreement in key areas, including \r\nclimate financing and the reduction of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. That remains one of the main pillars of the \r\ntransformative post-2015 development agenda.\r\nBearing in mind the need for progress, we have \r\ncommitted ourselves to implementing the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. That is our unfinished business. \r\nThe implementation and evaluation of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals have made us all conscious of the \r\nfact that such a vital process needs to be continued. \r\nCroatia is pleased that, in that regard, we have been \r\nbuilding the truly transformative and people-centred \r\nframework of the sustainable development goals \r\n(SDGs). Those goals represent the central investment in \r\nour common future. We must put the maximum effort \r\ninto making the SDGs a reality and into supporting their \r\ncontinuous implementation at all levels. Those goals \r\nrepresent an opportunity for long-term development \r\nthat humankind cannot afford to miss. In that vein, we \r\nhave supported the importance of good governance and \r\nthe rule of law as the enablers and an inseparable part \r\nof sustainable development. Everyone has a role to play: \r\nnational Governments, international organizations, the \r\nprivate sector, civil society, academia, the media and \r\nthe various other stakeholders.\r\nA key principle that matters to my country is \r\nequality among all human beings, regardless of their \r\nbeliefs, race, gender, national origin, ethnicity, religion, \r\ndisability, sexual orientation or other status. Croatia \r\nfully supports the pivotal role of the United Nations \r\nand its human rights mechanisms, in particular the \r\nHuman Rights Council, on the two tracks, namely, to \r\nfurther develop and strengthen the protection of human \r\nrights and to effectively respond in a timely way to \r\nthe challenges of the gross violation and systematic \r\nabuse of human rights worldwide. We firmly believe \r\nthat sustainable development goes hand in hand \r\nwith democracy, which should be approached in a \r\nholistic manner. That said, a number of international \r\nmechanisms ensure stable democracies and sustainable \r\ndevelopment by eliminating double standards, \r\ninsecurity and impunity. We therefore add our voice to \r\nthe calls for universal adherence to the Rome Statute \r\nand the universal jurisdiction of the International \r\nCriminal Court.\r\nAs I have already mentioned, we have recently \r\nwitnessed all kinds of natural disasters. Such situations \r\ndemand swift and prompt national and international \r\nactions, first and foremost, to mitigate the immediate \r\nthreat, as the same time as taking care of victims and \r\ndelivering humanitarian aid. The outbreak of epidemic \r\ndiseases also has a similar effect. A recent example is \r\nthe Ebola epidemic in some West African nations. It \r\ndenotes a matter for solidarity and understanding and \r\ndemands the world’s immediate and comprehensive \r\nresponse to the multifaceted medical, social, economic \r\nand security crisis.\r\nCroatia will continue to provide assistance to \r\nthe most vulnerable people, especially considering \r\nthat we have rich expertise in the area of capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes in a humanitarian crisis, in \r\nraising awareness of the dangers of landmines and \r\nother unexploded ordnance of war and in providing \r\npsychosocial support to victims of violence. In addition, \r\nlet me point out that Croatia was dedicated and active \r\nin delivering humanitarian aid to the f looded regions \r\nof its neighbouring countries of Serbia and Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina this spring, while we ourselves also faced \r\ngrave f loods and their consequences in Croatia. We \r\nall need more solidarity at the regional and the global \r\nlevels.\r\nOne of the most important goals of my presidency \r\nhas been and continues to be the promotion of dialogue \r\nand cooperation instead of conflict as a means of \r\nachieving security and stability for Croatia, as well as \r\nevery other country in the world. I am proud to say that \r\nCroatia has come a long way in that respect.\r\nWith the World Summit in 2005, we started \r\nreforming the United Nations system. Despite all \r\nthe progress made, we have not managed to achieve \r\nconcrete results with regard to the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Moreover, we would like to see the \r\nCouncil more engaged in preventing crises and its \r\nongoing dedication to its Charter duties rather than \r\nto any particular interest. In order to maintain the \r\nCouncil’s authority, relevance and indispensability in \r\nmaintaining global peace and security, its reform needs \r\nto be comprehensive and without further delay.\r\nOn numerous occasions, Croatia has stated its \r\nposition on Security Council reform. In our view, the \r\n22/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nenlargement should happen in both the permanent \r\nand the non-permanent categories of membership, \r\nincluding one additional non-permanent seat for the \r\nEastern European States. The enlargement is closely \r\nlinked to the reform of the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council, including the question of the use \r\nof the veto power. Croatia welcomes and supports the \r\ninitiative to establish a code of conduct with regard to \r\nthe suspension of the use of the veto in cases relating to \r\na mass crime.\r\nOn another note, we strongly believe that the \r\nconsolidation of the European space will be possible \r\nonly through the further stabilization and security \r\nof South-Eastern Europe. We look forward to the \r\nday when all countries of the region will finally be \r\nadmitted to the European Union. Croatia has been and \r\nwill continue to be an advocate for a continuous and \r\nstrong focus on South-Eastern Europe. The countries \r\nof the region are finding an increasing number of ways \r\nto cooperate together and to lay the foundation for the \r\njoint development of sustainable peace and stability, \r\nbe it with regard to the recent devastating f loods or to \r\ndealing with a difficult past, while achieving truth and \r\njustice on the issues of missing persons or of setting the \r\nstage for major infrastructure and transport projects.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to address an issue that \r\nI personally believe can be one of the best remedies \r\nfor achieving social improvement, economic advance \r\nand, consequently, political stability — education. \r\nThat is why I strongly support the Secretary-General’s \r\nGlobal Education First Initiative. Knowledge and \r\neducation are major driving forces of societies and one \r\nof the most important preconditions for success and \r\nsustainable development. Disparities in knowledge and \r\nits distribution, access and application have become \r\nmajor factors in determining the overall success of a \r\nnation and the level of its development. It is the best \r\nguarantee that the world’s development and stability \r\nwill go hand in hand and that global peace and security \r\nwith thus become stronger than ever.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ivo Josipović, President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah \r\nMu’izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di \r\nPertuan of Negara Brunei Darussalam\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of \r\nNegara Brunei Darussalam.\r\nHis Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin \r\nWaddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of Negara \r\nBrunei Darussalam, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah \r\nMu’izzaddin Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan \r\nof Negara Brunei Darussalam, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nSultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah: \r\nAllow me to join earlier speakers in offering my \r\ncongratulations to Mr. Sam Kutesa on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession. My thanks also go to our outgoing President, \r\nMr. John Ashe, for his excellent work over the past \r\nyear, especially his contribution to the discussions on \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda. I offer my profound \r\nappreciation to the many United Nations officials, \r\npeacekeepers and volunteers in the field who often \r\nwork in the most difficult conditions and put their lives \r\nat risk.\r\nIt is also fitting to offer our thanks and gratitude \r\nto the Secretary-General and his team for tirelessly \r\npromoting the cause of this world body, especially with \r\nrespect to urgent matters affecting the livelihoods and \r\nsecurity of our peoples. I also deeply appreciate his \r\npersonal support at the fifth summit of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the United \r\nNations held in Brunei Darussalam last year.\r\nToday is a special occasion for me personally and \r\nfor Brunei Darussalam as a nation. It marks the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of our membership in the Organization. \r\nLooking back, the world then was ideologically divided. \r\nNow we are linked by globalization and interdependence, \r\nsearching for a united approach to addressing the many \r\nchallenges faced by the human race. As we confront old \r\nand new problems, I believe the United Nations is best \r\nplaced to address them collectively. That is its strength, \r\na fact that is evident today as we strive to realize the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\n14-54841 23/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nWe are fast approaching the deadline of the MDGs, \r\nand we in Brunei Darussalam are pleased to see that \r\nthere is concerted global commitment and consensus \r\nwith respect to eradicating extreme poverty and \r\nfurther promoting peace and sustainable development. \r\nBrunei Damssalam actively contributes to regional \r\nand international efforts in the areas of training and \r\ncapacity-building through the Initiative for ASEAN \r\nIntegration and through collaboration with the United \r\nStates in an English enrichment programme for \r\nASEAN. Similar undertakings have also been carried \r\nout through the Commonwealth Fund for Technical \r\nCooperation.\r\nThe work of the United Nations and its relevant \r\nstakeholders in leading the way forward beyond 2015 \r\nis indeed laudable. I am encouraged by the fact that we \r\nhave accomplished a great deal in the current initiative. \r\nWe have also learned many valuable lessons that will \r\nhelp carry us through our journey in the coming decades. \r\nIt is reassuring to know that extensive discussions \r\nand wide-ranging consultations have been conducted \r\nto shape a universal framework for delivering and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda. I therefore welcome the new development \r\nagenda and its emphasis on the importance of a human \r\ndevelopment process that is inclusive, people-centred \r\nand sustainable.\r\nThose elements are also integral to Brunei \r\nDarussalam’s National Vision 2035, which is dedicated \r\nto improving the welfare of our people and ensuring \r\na high quality of life. I am also pleased that there is \r\nunanimous agreement on the importance of protecting \r\nthe environment. In that regard, I greatly value the \r\nconvening of the United Nations climate summit to \r\ngalvanize support for addressing the impact of climate \r\nchange and in ensuring a dynamic and sustainable post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nHowever, the full realization of our noble \r\nexpressions for the near future and the decades to come \r\nfaces many obstacles. The international and regional \r\nsituation continues to be threatened by instability, \r\ninjustices, social and economic inequalities and \r\nincreasingly frequent occurrences of natural disasters. \r\nWhile there is relative peace and stability in the world, \r\ndevelopments over the past year have reminded us \r\nof how complex security issues can cause turmoil \r\nand instability that threaten progress in long-term \r\ndevelopment. We are gravely concerned with security \r\ndevelopments in many parts of the world. Further \r\nescalation of conflicts can weaken the international \r\ncommunity’s resolve and ability to work together to \r\nachieve our worldwide initiatives.\r\nFor its part, Brunei Darussalam has participated \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping, specifically in the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and other \r\ninternational peace monitoring missions, such as our \r\nwork in the southern Philippines. We remain committed \r\nto such endeavours.\r\nThe overall outlook is further complicated by \r\nchallenges that are global in nature, ranging from the \r\nimpact of climate change, extremism and terrorism \r\nto the serious repercussions of pandemic diseases. \r\nBrunei Darussalam stands united with the international \r\ncommunity in combating terrorism in all its forms \r\nand in rejecting extremism. We support all regional \r\nand international efforts to counter terrorism, and we \r\nwill continue to participate in global initiatives such as \r\ninterfaith dialogues and dialogues among civilizations \r\ndesigned to promote understanding, tolerance and \r\nrespect among world communities.\r\nI call on every nation to take concerted action in \r\nworking to ensure that the rapid pace of globalization \r\nand interconnectedness brings wide-ranging benefits \r\nto all our peoples and communities. In securing the \r\npositive aspects of globalization, as a community \r\nof nations we must work closely together. We must \r\nrenew our approach to governance and strengthen \r\nour cooperation, especially in resolving new issues \r\nthat require collective global action and unity of \r\npurpose. I would like to emphasize the importance of \r\na comprehensive approach, especially when it comes \r\nto ensuring peace and security. Our peoples’ quality \r\nof life can be further enhanced only through inclusive \r\neconomic development and equitable social progress.\r\nAt the same time, all our efforts to develop our \r\neconomies should not work to the detriment of our \r\nnatural environment. These are areas that demand \r\nrenewed commitment, partnership and creativity on \r\nthe part of our global community. I would also like \r\nto underscore the importance of strengthening our \r\ncapabilities in disaster management. The frequent \r\nrecurrence and growing intensity of natural disasters in \r\nrecent years have caused great destruction and hardship \r\nto many communities around the world. Last year, \r\nBrunei Darussalam hosted a humanitarian assistance \r\nand disaster relief exercise for military personnel from \r\nacross the Asia-Pacific region, the first such event of \r\nits kind under the auspices of the ASEAN Defence \r\n24/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nMinisters Meeting Plus process. During the exercise, I \r\nwas very inspired as I witnessed the close cooperation \r\nand unity shown by the diverse range of participants \r\nfrom different nations, cultures and backgrounds, all \r\nstriving together to practise saving lives.\r\nSuch regional efforts are just a modest step. More \r\nimportant, the fundamental principles of mutual respect \r\nand trust, putting aside differences, upholding the rule \r\nof law and justice and promoting cooperation should \r\nserve as the basis for resolving conflicts, so that we \r\ncan all enjoy continued peace and stability. In the same \r\nspirit, I also hope that we can overcome our differences \r\nand move forward in further opening up global trade.\r\nAll our efforts to achieve the MDGs will be in \r\nvain if, at the same time, we disregard our commitment \r\nto pursuing peaceful means of settling disputes, as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nescalation of disputes and threats to international peace \r\nand security has resulted in appalling human tragedies \r\nsuch as the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-\r\n17 and the current dire situation in Gaza. Although the \r\nprospects of all-out war seem remote today, instances \r\nof worsening situations, skirmishes and brinkmanship \r\nhave shown us all too well how threats of conflict \r\nand violence remain an obstacle to our long-term \r\naspirations for a better world. For Palestine, freedom \r\nand justice are long overdue. The cycle of suffering \r\nexperienced by our Palestinian brothers and sisters is a \r\nstark example of how little our development goals mean \r\nif there is no peace or stability. The Palestinian people \r\nmust be granted their basic right to live in dignity and \r\nenjoy economic development. We are encouraged by \r\nthe observance of the current ceasefire by the parties \r\ninvolved, and I greatly appreciate the efforts of other \r\ncountries that have made that possible.\r\nLooking to the future, I remain hopeful. I still \r\nfirmly believe that we need this Organization in \r\norder to ensure that generations to come will enjoy a \r\nsecure and prosperous future. The world has changed \r\nfundamentally since the adoption of the MDGs, and \r\nI am confident that the United Nations will continue \r\nto be a source of hope. It is important that all States \r\ndo everything they can to contribute positively to our \r\nOrganization.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Sultan and Yang Di \r\nPertuan of Negara Brunei Darussalam for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nHis Majesty Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin \r\nWaddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of Negara \r\nBrunei Darussalam, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert Mugabe, President \r\nof the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Kutesa on assuming the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session. We are indeed \r\nproud of the honour that has been bestowed upon the \r\nAfrican continent as a result of his election. The theme \r\nhe has chosen for this session, that is, “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”, is pertinent, appropriate and \r\ntimely. It is relevant in our efforts to achieve a seamless \r\ntransition from the Millennium Development Goals to \r\nthe sustainable development goals and the broader post-\r\n2015 development agenda. We look forward to having a \r\ncandid and comprehensive debate on the challenges we \r\ncontinue to face at the domestic and international levels \r\nin our efforts to eradicate poverty.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nhelped to focus and mobilize global development \r\nefforts in order to achieve progress in the social sectors. \r\nHowever, despite the significant achievements within \r\nthe framework of the MDGs, progress was uneven \r\nbetween goals, among regions and within countries. \r\nConsequently, we cannot remain complacent when some \r\nsections of the global community are marginalized or \r\neven left behind. We are therefore gratified that the \r\nproposed sustainable development goals have taken \r\non board the unfinished business of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Part of that unfinished business \r\nconcerns the critical issue of poverty eradication, which \r\nremains the greatest global challenge. That issue should \r\n14-54841 25/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\ntherefore be the top priority and overarching objective \r\nof the development agenda for the future.\r\nWe in the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity share the view that the post-MDG agenda \r\nmust be informed by national development priorities and \r\nthat the new targets must better reflect local conditions. \r\nIn that regard, Zimbabwe adopted its own economic \r\nblueprint, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Socio-\r\nEconomic Transformation. It is a bold and achievable \r\ndevelopment programme that has the objective of \r\nensuring inclusive economic growth, decent jobs \r\nfor all, affordable and reliable energy, food security, \r\nsustainable agriculture and the development of reliable \r\nmodern infrastructure. Through the programme, we \r\nalso aim to expand the industrial base, which is key to \r\nthe sustained overall economic development and human \r\ndevelopment of our country. We continue to push for \r\nthe leveraging of our diverse and abundant resources \r\nthrough beneficiation and value addition. We therefore \r\nexpect that the proposals in the sustainable development \r\ngoals, which complement those elements of our national \r\naspirations, will be endorsed and integrated into the \r\npost-2015 development agenda framework.\r\nSocial justice, political stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in African countries can best be achieved \r\nthrough genuine and committed support for the \r\nownership of means of production that favour the poor, \r\nwho are in the majority. In Zimbabwe, my Government \r\nhas gone a long way in laying the foundation for \r\nsustained food production through our land reform \r\nprogramme. The majority of the rural people have been \r\nempowered to contribute to household and national \r\nfood security. The possession and exploitation of land \r\nhas also turned them into masters of their own destiny, \r\nthus giving true meaning to our national independence \r\nand unquestioned sovereignty.\r\nBecause Zimbabwe has thus been preoccupied with \r\nthe empowerment of its people economically, it has \r\nbecome a victim of the evil machinations of Western \r\ncountries, namely, the United States and States members \r\nof the European Union, which continue to apply \r\nunilateral and illegal sanctions as a foreign-policy tool \r\nto achieve short-term political objectives, particularly \r\nregime change. Regime change is a diabolical and \r\nillegal policy of interference in the domestic affairs of \r\nmy country, and no good can come from undermining \r\nour economy or depriving our citizens of the necessities \r\nof life. Why, I ask, should Zimbabweans continue to \r\nsuffer under the American and European yoke of \r\nunjustified and unwarranted illegal sanctions? Those \r\nevil sanctions violate the fundamental principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and should be condemned \r\nby the international community. We once again call for \r\ntheir immediate and unconditional removal.\r\nWe are a peaceful and peace-loving nation, ready to \r\nengage in constructive dialogue for mutually beneficial \r\nrelations. We call on those who continue to harbour \r\nill will against us to cast away their hegemony-driven \r\nhostility, as we appeal to them to review their hard-\r\nline and cruel positions and open a new chapter in their \r\nrelations with us based on mutual respect and friendly \r\ncooperation.\r\nTo support the implementation of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, we call for an expeditious reform \r\nof the Bretton Woods institutions, particularly their \r\ngovernance structures. It is high time that we addressed \r\nthe democratic deficit in those institutions and improved \r\ntheir legitimacy. Those reforms must reflect current \r\nrealities and ensure the full voice and participation of \r\ndeveloping countries in the decision-making and norm-\r\nsetting activities.\r\nZimbabwe firmly believes that the United Nations \r\nshould promote dialogue to achieve peace, the rule of \r\nlaw and common understanding among States. The \r\npeace, security, stability and welfare of Africa and our \r\nsubregion is vital for us. In Africa, the African Union is \r\nworking tirelessly to push for peace in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, South Sudan, the Central African \r\nRepublic and Somalia. The international community \r\nmust remain intensively engaged and support Africa \r\nin the maintenance of peace and stability, thereby \r\nenhancing its peacekeeping-capacity needs through \r\ntraining and logistical and financial support. Africa also \r\nremains seized of the issue of Western Sahara, the last \r\ncolonial vestige in Africa. The United Nations should \r\nnot shake off its responsibility to ensure the realization \r\nof self-determination by the people of Western Sahara.\r\nWe continue to witness the suffering and persecution \r\nof the people of Palestine at the hands of Israel. We have \r\nwitnessed the callous murder of women and children in \r\nshelters, where they seek refuge from Israel’s bombs. \r\nWe have witnessed the brutal and random destruction \r\nof infrastructure in the Gaza Strip. While those heinous \r\nacts were being perpetrated by Israel, the so-called \r\ncivilized world maintained a deafening silence. And we \r\nask, why?\r\n26/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nLasting peace in the Middle East can be achieved \r\nonly through a two-State solution based on the 1967 \r\nborders. Any other manoeuvres to change demographic \r\nrealities through settlements or the use of force will \r\nonly prolong the suffering of the Palestinians.\r\nIn conclusion, as we move forward, it is important \r\nto muster the necessary political will to create a \r\ndevelopment-oriented international environment that \r\nfacilitates the eradication of poverty and enhances \r\nthe sound management of our natural resources for \r\neconomic and social development, under a renewed and \r\nreal global partnership.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of Peru.\r\nMr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Humala Tasso (spoke in Spanish): My \r\nGovernment warmly welcomes the theme proposed for \r\nthis debate regarding the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nsince it directly addresses the most pressing problems \r\nfacing humanity, namely, inequality, hunger, poverty, \r\ninjustice and underdevelopment, factors that create \r\nsituations that our community of the United Nations \r\ncannot and should not tolerate. We must address our \r\ntask decisively, and in doing so we must be guided by \r\nthe principles set forth in our Charter, but above all, we \r\nmust have the firm commitment of all members of the \r\ninternational community. Our peoples, who are calling \r\nfor the implementation of a truly transformational \r\nglobal development agenda, expect nothing else from \r\nus.\r\nIn that regard, I wish to point out that, by virtue of \r\nthe universal, comprehensive and ambitious nature of \r\nour goals, the consensus achieved so far in the effort to \r\ndefine the sustainable development goals of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda constitutes an essential point \r\nof departure for that purpose. In that regard, I think that \r\nthe process in question deserves our strong support and \r\nmust be allocated the requisite resources in a timely \r\nmanner to ensure full implementation. Consistent with \r\nthat principle, Peru fully supports this process and is \r\nconfident that the adoption next year of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda will lead to the establishment of a \r\ngenuine global partnership for sustainable development. \r\nThe process will have participatory monitoring \r\nmechanisms so as to ensure appropriate follow-up and \r\nmonitoring.\r\nI wish to highlight that a clear-cut convergence \r\nexists between the guidelines promoted by Peru \r\nthrough its public policies on social inclusion and the \r\ngoals agreed upon by the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In both cases, priority \r\nis placed on initiatives to reduce poverty and inequality \r\nin all its forms, and to eradicate extreme poverty and \r\nhunger, once and for all. Similarly, emphasis is placed \r\non the struggle for equality, the empowerment of \r\nwomen, access to quality education and the elimination \r\nof all forms of gender-based violence and violence \r\nagainst children. It is also worth highlighting the \r\nimportance of continuing sustainable economic growth \r\nand promoting formal and decent employment. Those \r\nissues, among others, are of vital importance to Peru.\r\nTo that end, we must reflect on what type of State \r\nwe have today and move forward to meet the challenge. \r\nIn the case of Peru, we are pleased to highlight that we \r\nhave implemented a set of State reforms geared towards \r\nattaining those objectives. Peru has been working hard \r\nto consolidate and build upon the foundations for \r\nsustainable development. Our nation is a clear example \r\nof how it is possible to achieve substantial progress in \r\njust a few years, without straying from the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Charter, such as peace and security, \r\nhuman rights and development. In fact, Peru is one of \r\nthe countries that has made the most sustained progress \r\nin achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nsome of which will have been attained even before the \r\n2015 deadline. Thus, thanks to economic growth and a \r\ncoordinated and comprehensive social policy, we have \r\nachieved significant progress in fighting poverty, given \r\nthat we had set ourselves the goal for 2016 — the end of \r\n14-54841 27/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nmy term in office — to reduce that figure to under one \r\nfifth of the population.\r\nIn just one generation, Peruvians have implemented \r\na deep transformation based on the pacification of the \r\ncountry, the consolidation of democracy, stability, \r\nthe opening of its economy, as well as the creation \r\nand development of a social inclusion policy. That is \r\nprecisely why our aspirations, objectives and goals are \r\nincreasingly ambitious.\r\nWith that perspective, we see ourselves as an \r\nemerging country with strong institutions that is proud \r\nof its cultural diversity and of the skills of its people. \r\nWe have made significant progress in the reduction of \r\npoverty and child malnutrition. Our country is built \r\non an inclusive social platform that promotes equal \r\nopportunities, gender equality, justice and security.\r\nMy Administration is undertaking extraordinary \r\nefforts in that direction and has prioritized its action to \r\nfocus on the fields of health care, education, security \r\nand social welfare. On previous occasions, I have \r\ntalked about the body of first- and second-generation \r\nsocial programmes that we have been implementing, \r\namong which Qali Warma, which provides free meals \r\nin public schools, Juntos, a conditional cash-transfer \r\nprogramme, Pension 65, a non-contributory pension \r\nplan, and the Beca 18 scholarship programme are worth \r\nhighlighting. All of those programmes are coordinated \r\nunder a multisectoral strategy that prioritizes the \r\nhuman being and the family throughout their life cycle. \r\nThat strategy, which we call “include to grow”, is \r\nintended not only to alleviate the immediate needs of \r\nthe poor and extremely poor people but also to build \r\nthe capacities of individuals and to create opportunities \r\nfor all.\r\nThe Government of Peru has been increasing \r\nits budget for investment in social policies annually, \r\nreaching unprecedented figures. By way of example, I \r\ncan point out that the budget for 2015 has increased by \r\n12 per cent over that of last year, and that approximately \r\nhalf of that increase has been allocated to education \r\nand health care. The remainder is primarily for the \r\nexpansion of social programmes, the development of \r\ninfrastructure and the improvement of public safety, \r\nsince public safety is another major priority of my \r\nAdministration. Given that challenge, we constantly \r\nmonitor citizens’ demands and organize State action \r\nto effectively address those requests robustly and \r\neffectively in order to generate the climate of peace and \r\ntrust much needed by our families.\r\nHistorically, Peru has faced another impediment \r\nto development: corruption. That is why we are \r\ntaking drastic measures against those people who, in \r\nshameful exercise of their duties and public functions, \r\nbetray citizens’ trust. In that regard, in Peru, we are \r\nimplementing a concept of education and public and \r\npolitical ethics to be followed not only by those who \r\ngovern Peru but by all citizens, with a major emphasis \r\non those who implement and enforce the law. We are \r\nalso considering barring from public office for life \r\nthose who commit acts of corruption while carrying out \r\ntheir public duty.\r\nI would now like to talk about another major \r\nchallenge that we must overcome, namely, the world \r\ndrug problem. I would appeal to the international \r\ncommunity to continue to strengthen dialogue and \r\ncooperation so as to counter that scourge. We therefore \r\nbelieve that the special session of the General Assembly \r\nwill be an opportunity for the international community \r\nto jointly address that issue in a cooperative way. The \r\nscope of the threat is clearly global, and our response \r\nmust incorporate that dimension. We have given \r\npriority to a comprehensive strategy to implement \r\nalternative development and to support social inclusion \r\nprogrammes. In that way, we are regaining not only the \r\nterritory but also, most importantly, the people.\r\nHowever, in order to ultimately overcome that \r\nchallenge successfully, all relevant actors must \r\nparticipate actively. The joint and shared responsibility \r\nof producers and users, as well as the transit and \r\nfinancing countries, must facilitate the establishment \r\nof a comprehensive strategy, in which all those involved \r\nassume their responsibilities and adopt binding \r\nsolutions.\r\nOn the economic front, the recent adoption of \r\na national production diversification programme to \r\nexpand our production base, bring about a historical \r\nchange in the country’s economic structure and create \r\nformal employment seeks to leverage our capabilities and \r\nresources by promoting sustainable industrialization, \r\nentrepreneurship and access to science and technology. \r\nWe are thereby adding value to our production and \r\nmaking our growth and development sustainable.\r\nWe seek to continue expanding and deepening \r\nour trade relations, improve the existing 17 trade \r\nagreements that cover approximately 95 per cent of \r\nour foreign trade, while also moving towards the \r\ncompletion of the Doha Round of the World Trade \r\nOrganization. Peru’s aspiration to a more integrated \r\n28/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nworld is widely recognized. We therefore give particular \r\npriority to any participatory forum, such as the Pacific \r\nAlliance, which is an initiative that promotes the free \r\nmovement of persons, goods, services and capital and \r\ncooperation among its members, as well as the Asia-\r\nPacific Economic Cooperation. That aspiration also \r\nincludes the right of all countries to achieve the highest \r\nlevel of social, economic and trade development. \r\nWe therefore reiterate once again the call to end the \r\neconomic blockade against Cuba, which affects that \r\ncountry’s economic growth and delays its social and \r\nhuman development and has an impact on the welfare \r\nof its citizens.\r\nPeru’s relationships with its neighbours are \r\nexcellent. I wish to highlight the recent settlement of \r\nthe maritime dispute with Chile, achieved on the basis \r\nof international law and the principle of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as well as the fact that the \r\nhanding down of the ruling of the International Court \r\nof Justice was the fastest in its history. In general, the \r\nway in which the entire case was conducted makes Peru \r\nand Chile an example for the world.\r\nPeru affirms its active participation in the \r\ninternational community. In that context, we will be the \r\nhost country for the twentieth United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in December. On that occasion, the \r\ndiscussions will be important but national commitments \r\nwill be essential. Today, I say that we need to organize \r\nthe largest alliance in history to address that critical \r\nchallenge, in which the agreements reached will define \r\nthe future of our civilization. As the host country, I urge \r\nthe heads of State and Government to maintain their \r\npolitical will, so as to move forward constructively with \r\nrepresentatives that have the capacity to take decisions. \r\nIt is not only a matter of capitalizing on the Green \r\nClimate Fund but also one of clearly setting out national \r\ncommitments and achieving a binding agreement.\r\nWe must be conscious that, for the first time, \r\nhumankind has achieved the capacity for mass \r\ndestruction without resorting to nuclear energy. In \r\nthat regard, it is vital that the international community \r\nbecome aware that world problems, such as climate \r\nchange, require global, rather than national, responses. \r\nAccording to a 2011 study by the Economic Commission \r\nfor Latin America and the Caribbean, the cost of global \r\nwarming to Peru is revealed in f loods, droughts, thaws \r\nand warming waters and amounts to approximately 4 per \r\ncent of Peru’s annual gross domestic product (GDP). If \r\nwe do not take immediate action, the economic impact \r\nof climate change could be over 5 per cent of GDP by \r\n2030 and 20 per cent by 2050. Peru also recently ratified \r\nthe Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources \r\nand the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising \r\nfrom Their Utilization to the Convention on Biological \r\nDiversity, which will soon be in force to promote such \r\ngenetic resources.\r\nToday’s general debate finds us in a complex \r\nscenario with various severe political, humanitarian \r\nand economic crises. We are faced with major global \r\neconomic challenges regarding international security \r\nand global governance. The Security Council’s ability \r\nto respond to the various crises around the world \r\nhas revealed the need to reform its work methods, \r\nincluding those related to the use of the veto. The \r\nSecurity Council needs to respond in an effective way \r\nto those situations, which requires comprehensive \r\nreform, including increasing the number of permanent \r\nand non-permanent members, making that body more \r\nefficient, democratic, transparent and representative.\r\nSpecifically on the Palestine issue, my Government \r\nconfirms the need to address the root causes of that \r\nconflict through negotiations to achieve a viable and \r\nlasting solution, overcoming the status quo and enabling \r\nPalestinians and Israelis to live in peace and to prosper \r\nin the two States with secure and recognized borders.\r\nThe international community faces various ever-\r\ngrowing phenomena that transcend borders. I am \r\nreferring to terrorism, transnational organized crime, \r\nthe global drug problem, corruption, trafficking in \r\npersons, sexual exploitation, trafficking in young boys \r\nand girls and in adolescents, and arms smuggling, \r\namong others. With regard to acts committed by \r\nterrorist groups all over the world in recent months, my \r\ncountry knows the consequences of such acts very well, \r\nand they have been most energetically rejected by my \r\nGovernment.\r\nCombating terrorism is a responsibility that \r\nthe international community must assume within \r\nthe framework of the law, with full respect for the \r\nfundamental rights of all peoples and the sovereignty \r\nof States. Regarding the condemnable events that \r\nhave occurred in several regions of the world, the \r\nGovernment of Peru has expressed its strong rejection \r\nof such barbaric and terrorist attacks by extremist \r\ngroups against the lives of innocent civilian hostages \r\nand religious and ethnic minorities. Those intolerable \r\nevents deserve the firmest condemnation by the \r\ninternational community.\r\n14-54841 29/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nPeru is not just a country with its own history; it \r\nis also a civilization. Its culture is part of the world \r\nheritage of humankind, as recognized by UNESCO. \r\nThat recognition signifies a universal recognition of \r\nthe extraordinary work of our ancestors, who knew \r\nhow to harmonize development and the environment in \r\na sensible and creative way.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating Peru’s \r\ncommitment to the development and implementation \r\nof the post-2015 agenda, focusing on sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals, and by reiterating my call to \r\nallocate the means required to make them a reality. In \r\nthe context of the upcoming Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP-20) in \r\nLima, I wish to reiterate my commitment and that of the \r\nPeruvian Government to the Conference objectives, and \r\nwe call upon the international community to participate \r\nactively with a constructive spirit for sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the interest of our peoples. Peru, the \r\ncradle of the Inca civilization and the international \r\ncapital of excellent gastronomy, is ready to welcome \r\neveryone.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Peru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, President of the \r\nRepublic of Peru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister \r\nof Japan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan): Humankind faces serious, \r\nunprecedented crises. Now is the time for us to stand \r\nunited beneath the f lag of the United Nations to confront \r\nthose crises together. Japan is resolved to continue to \r\ntake on great responsibility, working hand in hand with \r\nthe international community.\r\nThe Government of Japan is expending its best \r\npossible efforts in the fight against the Ebola virus. \r\nThe international community should come together \r\nto address that crisis, which directly affects the peace \r\nand security of Africa. In that regard, Japan, as one \r\nof its sponsors, has strongly supported the adoption \r\nof Security Council resolution 2177 (2014). Japan has \r\nalso supported the initiative of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon, and His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa, President of the General Assembly, to establish \r\nthe United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency \r\nResponse.\r\nAt the fifth Tokyo International Conference on \r\nAfrican Development, held in Japan in the past year, \r\nthe Government of Japan announced that it would set \r\naside $500 million to address health issues in Africa \r\nand launch training programmes for some 120,000 \r\nhealth and medical-service providers. As a response to \r\nthe Ebola outbreak, we have sent highly knowledgeable \r\nand experienced Japanese experts, as members of \r\nWorld Health Organization missions. We have also \r\nextended a total of $5 million in financial assistance \r\nand will provide $500,000 worth of personal protective \r\nequipment for health-care workers. Furthermore, \r\nwe pledge to extend additional assistance totaling \r\n$40 million in future. We continue to be prepared to \r\ntake any other measures, including the possibility of \r\nsending more experts to Africa and sharing a potentially \r\npromising drug developed by Japan’s Toyama Chemical \r\nCompany and Fujifilm Holdings Corporation, which \r\ncould be effective in the post-exposure phase of Ebola.\r\nThe Middle East is in a state of unrest. In particular, \r\nJapan regards the activities of the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant — which extends across national borders \r\nand has unilaterally declared the establishment of a so-\r\ncalled state — as a serious threat to international order. \r\nWhat is important now is to prevent extremism from \r\ntaking root, while responding swiftly to the region’s \r\nhumanitarian crises. To assist in that, Japan will provide \r\n$50 million of emergency assistance right away.\r\nPlacing great importance on the stability of \r\nUkraine, in March Japan swiftly announced economic \r\nassistance of up to $1.5 billion, which is now being \r\nimplemented. We are also preparing new assistance \r\ntowards reconstruction of the eastern part of Ukraine.\r\n30/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nNext year will be a momentous one for the United \r\nNations. We will celebrate its seventieth anniversary. \r\nAt the time the United Nations was founded, Japan \r\nwas recovering from having been reduced to ashes. \r\nSince then, Japan has never for a moment forgotten the \r\nhorrors of war. It set out on its post-war path abhorring \r\nthe atrocities of a war that brought tragedy to innocent \r\npeople both at home and in other nations and renewing \r\nits pledge towards peace. We have made a wholehearted \r\ncommitment to shoulder United Nations responsibilities \r\nat home and abroad.\r\nJapan’s future lies in a straight extension of our \r\nhistory over the past 70 years. Our pledge to never wage \r\nwar will be handed down and fostered by the Japanese \r\npeople for generations to come. Peace will take root only \r\nwhen conflicts are deprived of places to reside within \r\nour hearts and our way of life. That is precisely why \r\nJapan is working to continue taking action at the grass-\r\nroots level around the world. Japan has been, is now \r\nand will continue to be a force providing momentum for \r\nproactive contributions to peace.\r\nMoreover, I wish to state and to pledge, first of all, \r\nthat Japan is a nation that has worked to eliminate the \r\nwar culture from people’s hearts, and it will spare no \r\neffort in continuing to do so. As early as the mid-1980s, \r\nJapan launched cooperation in Gaza to foster human \r\nresources. A total of more than 400 administrative \r\nofficials and technical experts have come to Japan to \r\nreceive intensive training. One of them is Mr. Najjar \r\nOsama, a young man serving as an official with the \r\nPalestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority. \r\nHe said:\r\n“Gaza has no natural resources whatsoever. \r\nThe only thing we have is people, a situation the \r\nsame as Japan’s. What I learned in Japan is the \r\nspirit of never, ever giving up.”\r\nAfter being educated in Japan for a month, Najjar \r\nOsama brought solar-power technology back to his \r\nhometown, to be attached to the facility in greatest need \r\nof a stand-alone power system. The equipment that he \r\nand his colleagues introduced to the largest hospital \r\nin the Gaza Strip has endured the unrest and kept the \r\nlights on in the hospital’s emergency room.\r\nIt is perhaps more than just a coincidence that the \r\nSomalia story I wish to tell also relates to lighting. \r\nThe most important thing for Hamidah Hassan — a \r\ngirl 10 years of age, living in the camps for internally \r\ndisplaced persons in Mogadishu — was lighting to \r\nilluminate the camp’s tents at night. A lit tent acts as \r\na deterrent to sexual violence. Over the past two years, \r\nJapan has distributed to internally displaced persons, \r\nincluding young girls such as Hamidah, some 2,500 \r\nsmall lanterns, made by Panasonic, that bank electricity \r\ngenerated from sunlight during the day and convert it \r\nto lamplight at night. Hamidah is now working hard, \r\ndreaming that one day she will become a doctor.\r\nWe must continue to clear away anxiety and fear \r\nfrom people’s hearts and cull any shoots of hatred. \r\nJapan and the Japanese people will continue to do \r\nour best to offer our own willingness and capacity, \r\nknowledge and experience, in order to make that a \r\nreality. First and foremost, we will continue to assist \r\nin enhancing education, which will form the basis of \r\neconomic growth for those who need it, from primary \r\neducation to vocational training. Our aim, always, is \r\nto internalize the joy of work in people’s nature. We \r\nhope for people to keenly realize that the sweat brought \r\nabout by their labour is an investment in the future.\r\nExpanding roads, ports and the increasingly \r\nconnected power grids, together with effective \r\ngovernance that is fully in step with those improvements, \r\nwill help to bring about an aff luent and peaceful society \r\nthat values human rights. When that concept receives \r\nbroad-based support, people become the owners of \r\ntheir society in the truest sense of the word. To expand \r\nthat kind of society from a point to a line, and from a \r\nline to a plane, Japan has always sought foundations of \r\npeace. We have always focused our official development \r\nassistance philosophy on that approach.\r\nThe banner of a proactive contribution to peace \r\nborne by the Japanese Government is a f lag planted \r\natop the natural development of conviction and self-\r\nconfidence that we have acquired through many years \r\nof promoting human security, that is, working as hard \r\nas we could for the development of a society that places \r\npeople front and centre. We will carry on with our work, \r\nhoping to create, in time, a fair and just society that \r\nplaces human beings front and centre and a democracy \r\nthat values human rights.\r\nSeventy years ago, the United Nations proclaimed \r\nits determination “to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war” and to “practice tolerance”. The \r\nUnited Nations must not depart from those ideals. It \r\nis with exactly that determination that Japan aspires to \r\njoin the Security Council once again as a non-permanent \r\nmember next year, marking the seventieth year since \r\nthe start of the United Nations.\r\n14-54841 31/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nOver the 58 long years since Japan became a \r\nMember of the United Nations in 1956, as its eightieth \r\nMember, Japan has worked tirelessly for the causes of \r\nthe United Nations. We believe that our efforts have \r\nbeen second to none. It is my wish, with the seventieth \r\nanniversary as a turning point, that countries sharing \r\nthe same aims can all work together to finally resolve \r\nthe long-standing issue of the reform of the United \r\nNations in a way that reflects the realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. In that context, Japan seeks to become a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council and to take \r\non an appropriate role that the status requires.\r\nIt was on the same occasion last year that I spoke \r\nof the significance and importance of enhancing the \r\npower of women and appealed for us to create a society \r\nin which women shine (see A/68/PV.12). Japan has now \r\nbegun to work towards resolving the numerous issues \r\nwe face, together with private industries, in order to \r\nincrease women’s participation in society as soon as \r\npossible. We must foster environments in which it is \r\npossible to balance child care and nursing care on the \r\none hand and work on the other. In addition, eliminating \r\nbiases about the roles of women that still exist in society \r\nwill be basic, more so than anything else.\r\nWe have just held a large-scale international \r\nconference with an aim of promoting the dynamic \r\nparticipation of women. With an eye set on economic \r\ndevelopment and the resolution of global issues, \r\nabout 100 leaders from all sectors of society from \r\naround the world sent out a message to the world of \r\ntheir commitment to bringing the power of women to \r\nfruition. In less than a year, the empowerment of women \r\nhas become a guiding principle that has driven Japan’s \r\npolicies both domestically and overseas. Japan has \r\nfocused on advancing the status of girls and mothers \r\nin Africa, a region that receives emphasis within our \r\nforeign aid.\r\nThe twentieth century had a history of profound \r\nharm to women’s honour and dignity when conflicts \r\nbroke out. Around the globe, we still find abhorrent \r\ncircumstances in which women are denied access \r\nto such basic services as medical care and education \r\nmerely because they were born female, thereby \r\ndepriving them of opportunities to become self-reliant. \r\nJapan seeks to be a country that walks alongside such \r\nwomen throughout the world. We intend to encourage \r\nand support, throughout the world, the self-reliance of \r\nwomen whose hearts have suffered grievous harm.\r\nWe intend to make the twenty-first century a \r\nworld without human rights violations against women. \r\nJapan will stand at the fore and lead the international \r\ncommunity in eliminating sexual violence during \r\nconflicts. Therein lies the reason for Japan to reinforce \r\nits cooperation with Ms. Zainab Bangura’s Office of \r\nthe Special Representative of the Secretary-General on \r\nSexual Violence in Conflict.\r\nFundamental rights such as education and health \r\nmust be ensured everywhere throughout the world. It is \r\nnecessary for the United Nations and, indeed, the world \r\nto come together as one to take action so that girls \r\nand boys can attend school equally and that expectant \r\nmothers can receive medical care with peace of mind. \r\nMoreover, in order for women to lead lives full of pride \r\nand hope, I consider it essential to develop their ability \r\nto be economically self-reliant, above all else. I do not \r\nhave the slightest doubt that the creation of a society \r\nin which women shine holds the key to changing the \r\nwhole of society.\r\nLast year I pledged in my address here, before \r\nthe General Assembly, that Japan would implement \r\nassistance in excess of $3 billion over three years, \r\naimed chiefly at advancing the status of women. The \r\namount already implemented over the past year is \r\n$1.8 billion, more than half the amount pledged. I also \r\nstated Japan respected the activities of UN-Women, \r\nwhich is responsible for women’s issues within the \r\nUnited Nations, and that we intended to become one \r\nof its leading contributors and thus a model country \r\nin that area. Over the past year, Japan increased its \r\ncontributions to UN-Women fivefold, and in the future \r\nwe will further increase the number of projects we \r\nsupport. We are also very pleased that next year UN-\r\nWomen will open its Tokyo office. I expect that Japan \r\nwill further enhance its coordination with the United \r\nNations through that new office.\r\nAs we draw up the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nJapan will continue to be as strongly involved as it \r\nhas been to date. However, I strongly urge that if we \r\nare to truly attain inclusiveness, sustainability and \r\nresilience, as put forth in that agenda, then protection \r\nand empowerment of the vulnerable, irrespective of \r\nrace, gender, or age, is important.\r\nThis year Japan marks the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the start of its official development assistance \r\n(ODA). Having learned from the determination of \r\nour predecessors, who began working to extend ODA \r\n32/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\na mere nine years after suffering total devastation in \r\nwar, the Government of Japan is now in the process of \r\nestablishing new guiding principles for our ODA. We \r\nintend to once more emphasize as priorities objectives \r\nsuch as high-quality economic growth, ensuring rule of \r\nlaw and realizing a peaceful and stable society.\r\nThe objectives that Japan has continuously targeted \r\nthrough its ODA over those 60 years will not change \r\nin the slightest. There will be no change in our deeply \r\nrooted approach in which the most important thing in the \r\nfight against poverty is to cultivate a sense of ownership \r\namong the people concerned and to encourage self-help \r\nefforts. Nor will there be any changes in our efforts to \r\nfully ensure human security. Moreover, as we pursue \r\nenhancing women’s empowerment as the leverage \r\npoint, I consider the attainment of our goals to be that \r\nmuch nearer.\r\nOver the past 20 years Japan has sent about \r\n9,700 people on 13 United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. In the 10 years since the establishment of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission, Japan’s contributions \r\nto the Peacebuilding Fund have surpassed $40 million. \r\nIn the future, we intend to cultivate still further our \r\nhuman resources in terms of both quantity and quality, \r\nto contribute to the area of peacebuilding.\r\nAs the only country ever to have suffered the \r\ndevastation of atomic bombings during wartime, Japan \r\nis prepared to lead discussions in the Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons to be convened next year — the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the atomic bombings.\r\nWith regard to North Korea, Japan will work \r\nin coordination with relevant countries towards the \r\ncomprehensive resolution of outstanding issues, \r\nincluding abduction and nuclear and missile issues.\r\nJapan has been among the biggest beneficiaries of \r\nthe United Nations. Going forward, we will work harder \r\nthan ever to bring about realization of the principles \r\nset forth by the United Nations. Japan is a nation that \r\nimplements its pledges without fail. With that, I will \r\nend my discussion.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Dessalegn (Ethiopia): It is indeed a great \r\npleasure to see a seasoned African diplomat presiding \r\nover the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I \r\nwould like to express my warmest congratulations to \r\nhim on his election to that high office. I know he is \r\naware, as we are, that he is assuming his responsibility \r\nat one of the most critical periods in the history of this \r\nOrganization and that of multilateralism in general. \r\nThose of us in the East African region know him very \r\nwell as a friend and distinguished diplomat. We are \r\nconfident that he will use his wisdom and experience \r\nto build consensus on a range of issues on the agenda \r\nof the General Assembly at this historic session and \r\neffectively guide its work. Let me therefore assure him \r\nof the full support and cooperation of my delegation in \r\nthe successful discharge of his heavy responsibilities. I \r\nalso wish to commend his predecessor for the excellent \r\ncontribution he made to ensuring the success of the \r\nsixty-eighth session of the General Assembly. Indeed, \r\nit was a remarkable session, which laid the foundation \r\nfor the major task that lies ahead.\r\nThis session is being held at a historic time, when \r\nwe have embarked upon a major undertaking to shape \r\nthe future we want for present and future generations. If \r\nwe do what we must, it could be remembered in history \r\nas a session that helped us turn the corner in ensuring \r\neffective custodianship of the environment, economic \r\njustice and social responsibility. What we agreed over \r\ntwo years ago in Rio must be what galvanizes our \r\ncommon effort. We said then that poverty eradication \r\nis the greatest global challenge facing the world today \r\nand an indispensable requirement for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\n14-54841 33/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nLast month, we marked 500 days until the target \r\ndate for the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nwhich we have agreed to achieve by the end of 2015. \r\nIn Africa, robust economic growth has been registered \r\nover the past decade, and the stereotypical narrative \r\nabout the continent is slowly changing. Africa is now \r\nthe rising continent, offering tremendous opportunities \r\nfor trade and investment. Notable progress has also \r\nbeen made towards achieving the MDGs, including in \r\nmy own country, Ethiopia. There are nonetheless many \r\nremaining challenges, such as with respect to reducing \r\nthe maternal death rate.\r\nIt is therefore necessary, as we move forward in the \r\nnegotiations to formulate the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, not to overlook the fact that the MDGs are \r\nstill unfinished business. The post-2015 development \r\nagenda will be complete when it rests on a satisfactory \r\noutcome in terms of the implementation of the MDGs. \r\nAccordingly, the remaining months should be used to \r\naccelerate their implementation. Moreover, the post-\r\n2015 development agenda will need to make provision \r\nfor concluding any aspects of the MDGs that might \r\nhave to be carried beyond 2015.\r\nWhat we have done thus far in connection with \r\nlaying the groundwork for the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, both at the intergovernmental level and that \r\nof the Secretariat, has been encouraging. The Open \r\nWorking Group on Sustainable Development Goals has \r\nsuccessfully completed its work, and the two co-chairs \r\nmust be commended for the contribution they have \r\nmade. It would be proper, as the Assembly decided \r\nat its sixty-eighth session, to use the Open Working \r\nGroup’s proposals as a basis for integrating sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals into the post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nI would also like to express appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for the efforts he has made in that \r\nregard, in conformity with the request contained in the \r\noutcome document (resolution 65/1) of the 2010 MDG \r\nSummit. The work of the High-level Panel of Eminent \r\nPersons on the Post-2015 Development Agenda has \r\nbeen significant. We are particularly appreciative of \r\nthe invaluable contribution made by the United Nations \r\nSystem Task Team on the Post-2015 United Nations \r\nDevelopment Agenda. We look forward to the synthesis \r\nreport by the Secretary-General, which we trust will \r\nhelp facilitate effective conversation among Member \r\nStates and productive intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwith a view to formulating a post-2015 development \r\nagenda that reflects the interests of present and future \r\ngenerations by next year.\r\nWe have no doubt that a post-2015 development \r\nagenda that responds to the major challenges the world \r\nfaces must rest on a readiness to foster cooperation, \r\nbased on the principle of equitable and common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. It is difficult to imagine \r\nthat the difficult but indispensable issues surrounding \r\nthe means of implementation can be resolved unless \r\nthere is f lexibility on the question of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\r\nOne thing is clear in all this. The world has the \r\ncapacity and resources to effectively respond to the \r\npressing needs we see, to eradicate poverty and ensure \r\nsustainable development for all. That has been affirmed \r\nby the advance unedited report of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing. The Committee has not offered us definitive \r\nproposals, but rather recommendations designed, as \r\nthey say, to stimulate discussions. It has nonetheless \r\nexpressed its hope that progress will be made on \r\ndevelopment financing at the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, which is to \r\ntake place in Addis Ababa in July 2015. Let me affirm \r\nour commitment to doing our best to ensure that that \r\nhistoric and extremely critical conference succeeds. It \r\nappears to us to be obvious that the effectiveness of the \r\npost-2015 agenda depends, among other things, on the \r\nsuccess of the Addis Ababa conference. At any rate, it \r\nis with that conviction that we will proceed to discharge \r\nour responsibility as the host country.\r\nThis is also the time when we are striving to achieve \r\nan ambitious target that we have set for ourselves: that \r\nis, to reach a globally binding climate agreement by \r\n2015 that will limit the rise in the global temperature \r\nto below 2 ̊ Celsius. Let me once again express my \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nconvening the Climate Summit two days ago. I hope \r\nthe outcome of the Summit will help us to make \r\nprogress in achieving this fundamental objective by \r\ncatalysing action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \r\nand strengthening climate resilience.\r\nNeedless to say, we in Africa are already facing the \r\nbrunt of climate change, and this is undermining our \r\nefforts to meet our development aspirations, including \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. For us, adaptation \r\nand mitigation remain a priority, and we need urgent \r\ninternational support for our efforts in that regard. \r\nAlthough we have contributed virtually nothing to \r\n34/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nglobal warming, we are indeed playing a leading role \r\nin terms of mitigation by scaling up our efforts in \r\nrenewable energy and promoting energy efficiency. It is \r\nonly fair and proper that that be adequately recognized \r\nand supported.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the challenge posed \r\nby climate change requires leadership and political \r\ncommitment at all levels. We have no choice but to \r\nrise to that challenge by taking concrete actions to \r\nhelp reduce emissions and demonstrating the necessary \r\npolitical will to achieve a globally binding climate \r\nagreement by 2015 in Paris. Failure is not an option.\r\nWhat we see here at the United Nations is a \r\nreadiness on the part of States to think big and focus \r\non what unites us. That is what underlies the complex \r\nnegotiations on the post-2015 development agenda. In \r\nsharp contrast to that, what we are witnessing today is \r\na general deterioration of the global security situation. \r\nThe world is passing through a turbulent period, and \r\nthat is not an exaggeration. The proliferation and \r\nintensity of conflicts have significantly increased.\r\nIn our part of the world, progress made over the past \r\ndecade is being undermined by new cycles of violence \r\nand conflict. The crisis in South Sudan is an example. \r\nWe in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\n(IGAD) region are doing everything we can to resolve \r\nthe South Sudanese crisis through peaceful means with \r\nthe support of the United Nations, the African Union \r\nand international partners. But progress, let alone \r\na breakthrough, has not been easy to come by. The \r\nsituation highlights an often encountered challenge. \r\nProgress in peacemaking can hardly be contemplated \r\nwhen there is a lack of sufficient commitment to \r\na peaceful resolution of a crisis by the parties to the \r\nconflict. But IGAD is determined to expend every \r\npossible effort to find a lasting solution to the crisis \r\nthrough an all-inclusive political dialogue.\r\nIn contrast with the situation in South Sudan and \r\nwith situations in many parts of the world, the situation \r\nin Somalia has been improving over the course of the \r\nyear. Al-Shabaab may not have been entirely removed \r\nas a threat, but it has been greatly degraded. The recent \r\nsetback it suffered is bound to speed up its demise. The \r\nmilitary gains made on the ground cannot, however, \r\nbe sustained without progress on the political track \r\nthrough the establishment of local administrations and \r\nthe maintenance of law and order in the newly liberated \r\nareas. In that regard, we welcome the establishment \r\nof interim local administrations in central and south-\r\nwest Somalia in line with the provisional Federal \r\nConstitution. We need to continue to support Somalia \r\nin its efforts to rebuild itself and make a successful \r\ntransition by 2016.\r\nConflict is not an exclusively African phenomenon. \r\nWhat has become obvious lately is how much the global \r\nsecurity situation is becoming a source of concern. \r\nNever since the end of the cold war has the global \r\nsecurity situation been as fragile as it is today. The threat \r\nof terrorism has affected ever greater and wider areas \r\nof the world. At no time over the past many decades has \r\nthe need for effective cooperation at the international \r\nand regional levels been as pressing and as urgent as it \r\nis today. That the issue of foreign fighters has become \r\na source of major concern to many is obvious. What is \r\nrequired to make progress in addressing the challenge is \r\na readiness to forge cooperation that brooks no double \r\nstandards. We need to be resolute in our determination \r\nto work together.\r\nAll that means that at no time in recent memory \r\nhas multilateralism been as immensely crucial for the \r\nfuture of the world as it is today. The fact that nations \r\nare driven by the pursuit of national interests has \r\nalways been self-evident. But at this juncture in world \r\nhistory and in the light of the many common challenges \r\nthat we all face, we have no more realistic option \r\nthan a commitment to enlightened national interest, \r\nwhich can be promoted only within the framework of \r\nmultilateralism.\r\nThat, in our view, is the sentiment that we should \r\nall share at the beginning of the sixty-ninth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We cannot be oblivious to the \r\nnexus between our sustainable development agenda and \r\nthe global situation of peace and security. “Delivering \r\non and implementing a transformative post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda”, the theme of this session, \r\nrequires a peaceful and stable global environment. It is \r\nalso in that context that the threat of the spread of the \r\nEbola virus should be viewed. It is both a humanitarian \r\nand a security challenge. Containing the spread of the \r\ndeadly virus should be a matter of utmost priority.\r\nLet me reiterate that it is critical that we collectively \r\naddress the myriad of peace and security challenges \r\nfacing our world in order to facilitate progress in the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\nin the remaining period and to lay a solid foundation for \r\nthe realization of our transformative agenda in the post-\r\n2015 era, as well as to achieve a meaningful climate \r\nagreement.\r\n14-54841 35/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nI wish to conclude by stressing Ethiopia’s \r\ncommitment to multilateralism, to joining hands with \r\nall like-minded countries in order to contribute to \r\nregional and international peace and security and to the \r\nsuccessful realization of the major projects that we will \r\nundertake in connection with the post-2015 agenda. \r\nAs a founding member of the Organization and as a \r\nmember of the League of Nations — although Ethiopia \r\nwas abandoned by the League — Ethiopia attaches \r\nthe highest priority to cooperation among peoples \r\nand countries with a view to addressing common \r\nchallenges. It is our conviction that might does not \r\nmake right. There is no substitute for the pursuit of \r\nmutual advantages as a guideline for a realistic and just \r\nforeign policy. That is our guide for all the friendships \r\nand partnerships we have and will continue to develop.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Matteo Renzi, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Republic of Italy\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Matteo Renzi, President \r\nof the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Renzi (Italy) (spoke in Italian; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): I would like to greet the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to confess how deeply moved \r\nI feel to be here. For those who have never spoken in \r\nthe Assembly Hall, it remains a place of extraordinary \r\nfascination and appeal. For those who have become \r\naccustomed to being in such halls, they may consider \r\nit as something already seen and experienced. For \r\nsomeone like me, who is in the Hall for the first time \r\ntoday, the emotion is overwhelming to find oneself in \r\nthe place where there is a sense of still being able to \r\nbuild a horizon of human rights, respect, freedom and \r\npeace. I feel the emotion of the future in a place where \r\na great Secretary-General, Mr. Dag Hammarskjőld, had \r\nthe strength, the vision and the intuition to design a \r\ndifferent world. For those, like us, who grew up with that \r\nmodel, the statement “For all that has been — thanks. \r\nFor all that shall be — yes”, which Dag Hammarskjőld \r\nwrote in his diary, the United Nations was something \r\nmore than a political programme, it was the very idea \r\nof a definition of politics.\r\nYet today, the future appears threatening. The \r\nfuture is frightening. The future is no longer promising. \r\nWe want to believe that it is possible to return to the \r\nidea of tomorrow. It is the dream of the United Nations \r\nto return to the goal of preserving future generations \r\nfrom the horrors of war. Today, however, we must \r\nhave the courage also to say, when looking back at the \r\nhistory of the Organization, that the errors of the past \r\ncannot be erased. The year 2015 is the year in which we \r\nwill recall the twentieth anniversary of what happened \r\nin Srebrenica, when international institutions remained \r\nsilent before one of the worst massacres and genocides \r\nthat still today finds no justification. That is why we \r\nneed to repeat in this Hall today that it is time for \r\npolitics to return to finding a definition of a future of \r\nhope.\r\nMy generation grew up hearing that history had \r\nended, that the century that had just passed was a short \r\ncentury in which we had already seen everything. But \r\nhistory has not ended, the century we have left behind us \r\nwas not short, and today, we must say that the political \r\nway is the only way to prevent the bloodletting that \r\nis causing so much grief in the Mediterranean, in the \r\nMiddle East, in Ukraine and in many regions of Africa.\r\nBecause of its central location, Italy has the will and \r\nthe need to play a greater role in the Mediterranean. Italy, \r\nwhose gift to the world is the image of the city and the \r\npublic square — in the sense of an open gathering place \r\nfor the community — cannot be silent when confronted \r\nwith the transformation of the Mediterranean, which \r\nshould be the heart of Europe and the public square for \r\ndiscussion and confrontation, but has all too often been \r\ntransformed into a cemetery.\r\nI take the f loor today one year after the Italian \r\nGovernment launched an important operation called \r\nMare Nostrum. Thanks to that operation, I can stand \r\nbefore the Assembly and say that the men and women \r\nof the Italian Coast Guard and volunteer services have \r\nsaved 80,000 human lives, 80,000 people who could \r\nbecome doctors, musicians, workers, 80,000 people \r\n36/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nwho were pulled from the Mediterranean as if from a \r\ncemetery, thanks to an operation that we take pride in \r\nbut that cannot be left only to Italy today. We need to \r\nsay forcefully that intervention in the Mediterranean \r\narea is a strategic intervention for the international \r\ncommunity that cannot only be left to a single force.\r\nIn saying that, we need to add that the priority \r\nfor that area today is Libya and our friends, the \r\nLibyan people, who are suffering through a time of \r\ntransition that seems never to end. We are committed \r\nnot to underestimate a hot spot in the midst of the \r\nMediterranean that could reach a point of no return in \r\na spiral of violence and instability in the region. Italy \r\nwill continue to do its part, but we must emphasize \r\nwith decisiveness and intensity in this prestigious \r\nforum that the risk of a gradual fragmentation of \r\nLibya and the negative consequences that that would \r\ntrigger for the entire North African region would be \r\ncatastrophic for peace and stability in the entire region. \r\nWe are committed to supporting a strong and stable \r\nLibya, and we will continue to work with the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for Libya \r\nthrough our embassy, which is still open, but we want \r\nto say with great determination that the situation in \r\nLibya must be a priority for all.\r\nAnother priority, especially for those today who \r\nare preparing for a discussion on the terrorist threat in \r\nthe Middle East and elsewhere, is to be aware that the \r\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as was said \r\nyesterday with great force, is not just a terrorist threat \r\nto a specific region, but a risk for the entire community \r\nof men and women who would call themselves human. \r\nWe are not dealing with a form of religious expression. \r\nReligions can both fuel the fires of a conflict and \r\nprovide water to heal wounds. We believe that ISIL and \r\nthe threat it represents are not connected in the slightest \r\nway with a conflict of religions.\r\nAt the same time, we say forcefully that those of \r\nus who had the duty — or the good fortune, if I may \r\nspeak provocatively — to visit a refugee camp, as I \r\ndid in the second half of August in Erbil, Kurdistan, in \r\nIraq, will realize that we cannot be unresponsive to the \r\ndismayed faces of so many victims of fanaticism. To see \r\nan international aid worker who shows you images on \r\nher cellphone of children who were executed, who were \r\nlined up against a wall and shot; to hear stories about \r\nyoung women taken to barracks in the centre of Mosul \r\nand forced, in silence and powerlessness, to satisfy \r\nall the desires of violent terrorists; to think of what is \r\nhappening to journalists and hostages — requires us \r\nto say what must be said. A genocide is under way, \r\nand in the face of such activities, we know that only a \r\nunified international community can win this battle of \r\ncivilization against evil. That is why I said yesterday \r\nto President Obama that the international coalition can \r\ncount on Italy’s support to eliminate the threat posed \r\nby ISIL, and I continue to insist on the fact that the \r\ncommitment of our country in every region and in \r\nevery area of the region will be resolute and, I hope, \r\ndecisive.\r\nItaly has contributed and will continue to contribute \r\nin Lebanon, through our soldiers and their commitment \r\nto supporting the United Nations peacekeeping mission \r\ndeployed in the south of Lebanon. I would take this \r\nopportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to those \r\nwomen and men who, from Lebanon to Afghanistan, \r\nwear the uniform of our country to make a concrete \r\ncommitment to ensuring stability and peace. But at \r\nthe same time, I know, we know, that there will be \r\nno peace in the region until what a great prophet of \r\nItalian political thought, Giorgio La Pira, called the \r\n“peace of the children of Abraham” has brought an \r\nend to the unresolved conflict between the Israelis and \r\nPalestinians.\r\nWe will never tire of seeking peace for Jerusalem, \r\nand a ceasefire in Gaza will be consolidated and \r\nrespected only if we all recognize the two-State \r\nsolution and the right of the Palestinian people to \r\nfinally have a homeland. As I have said before and I \r\nrepeat here, it is not only a right but a duty for Israel \r\nto exist — for the sake of history, memory, innovation, \r\ndemocracy, freedom, of which the Israeli people give \r\nconstant proof. The entire international community \r\nmust support that process. Those words must be clearly \r\nheard in this Hall, where someone once dared to call \r\ninto question the very right of Israel to exist.\r\nIt is dialogue and politics that can prevent a return \r\nto the dialectics of the cold war. We had thought that \r\nthose times were behind us, but now the tensions on \r\nthe eastern borders of Ukraine risk are jeopardizing \r\nthe greatest achievement of the European integration \r\nprocess — a continent of peace and stability. Never \r\nbefore had there been such a long period of peace as the \r\none we are experiencing today in Europe.\r\nBut the crisis in Ukraine has forced us to confront \r\nunexpected challenges. I believe that there is a \r\nconnection between two fundamental principles — the \r\nright of the Ukrainian people to have the territorial \r\n14-54841 37/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nunity of their country recognized in the face of acts of \r\naggression that have violated its integrity, and at the \r\nsame time, I hope that we can overcome the tensions \r\nwith the Russian Federation, which will, I hope, return \r\nto playing its role as a global stakeholder so needed by \r\nthe international community.\r\nA great expert in politics from the Italian \r\nRenaissance, Niccolò Macchiavelli, wrote, “To know \r\nhow to recognize an opportunity in war and take is \r\nof greater benefit than anything else”. Macchiavelli’s \r\nwords helps us understand in this moment that the Minsk \r\nAgreement is a great opportunity in the war under way \r\nin Ukraine. We must seize this opportunity for the \r\npeople of Ukraine and the international community.\r\nDialogue and reconciliation are indispensable \r\ntools in the Sudan, Somalia and in the Central African \r\nregion. They are the strong point of our community as \r\nit faces newly emerging difficulties, starting with the \r\nEbola virus and its dramatic humanitarian, social and \r\neconomic consequences. Italy is doing its part and will \r\ncontinue to do so, following the Secretary-General’s \r\nleadership and inspiration, whom I thank for his prompt \r\naction.\r\nBut I should also emphasize that political solutions \r\nare the only way forward for the year 2015, although \r\nthey are often marked by complex, difficult challenges. \r\nProblems to be solved include the challenge of achieving \r\nnew global governance of the Internet, as the President \r\nof Brazil mentioned yesterday (see A/69/PV.6), and \r\nthe challenge of finally making a major investment \r\nin gender equality, so that we no longer consider it \r\nnewsworthy when a woman takes on a position of \r\nresponsibility. I am very proud to say that for the first \r\ntime in its history, women make up more than half of \r\nmy Government. I am happy and pleased to say that we \r\nwill never fall short in our commitment to leadership \r\nroles for women, but above all we will fight to ensure \r\nthat young women can be free in developing countries \r\nand nations facing especially difficult situations.\r\nI cannot emphasize strongly enough that 2015 will \r\nbe a very important year in the fight against religious \r\ndiscrimination. Every religious minority has the right \r\nto be defended. Never before have so many Christians \r\nbeen killed in regions around the world because of their \r\nfaith, and never before has one of the genuine tragedies \r\nof our times been so badly underestimated. Within the \r\ninternational community it is especially vital that we \r\nforcefully affirm the values of equality, respect and \r\ntolerance, which are of special relevance for us in Italy \r\nwhen talking about the death penalty. That is why this \r\nnew session of the General Assembly coincides with \r\nthe presentation of a new draft resolution on abolishing \r\ncapital punishment. I hope that the number of countries \r\nsupporting it will continue to grow.\r\nI would like to say that I am especially excited to \r\nbe able to speak about that on behalf of Italy, which \r\nhas always fought at both the governmental and the \r\nnon-governmental levels to make that issue a priority. \r\nEarlier in my career, I was mayor of the city of Florence, \r\nwhich was the first place in history to abolish the death \r\npenalty. A herald descended the steps of the Palazzo \r\nVecchio to announce that in that State, the Grand \r\nDuchy, the death penalty had been abolished. Let us \r\nnot pile more barbarous acts on other ones. I ask every \r\nState to join us in this battle for civilization.\r\nThe year 2015 will also be an important one for \r\nthe Expo in Milan and the United Nations Climate \r\nChange Conference in Paris, which we discussed two \r\ndays ago, and for actions that remind us of the need \r\nfor a turning point, such as in the debate over Security \r\nCouncil reform. We all believe that the Council must \r\nbe made more effective, representative, transparent \r\nand accountable to the members of the international \r\ncommunity. But opinions on how to achieve that goal \r\nstill differ. In order to bring the various reform models \r\ncloser together, the Uniting for Consensus group, to \r\nwhich my country belongs, continues to maintain that \r\ncreating new permanent members would imperil that \r\ngoal, and I reiterate our willingness to find compromise \r\nsolutions.\r\nI believe that it is crucial that all those challenges \r\nbe seen as subsumed within the greatest challenge of \r\nthem all, one in which we must all be on the front lines. \r\nThere can be no peace, no freedom, no respect until \r\nthe international community puts at the centre of its \r\nstrategy a gigantic, grand investment into education, \r\nschools, universities, going from house to house, \r\nvillage to village, piazza to piazza. We say that the \r\nmost powerful weapon in affirming the values of peace \r\nand freedom is the weapon of education, of culture, \r\nof human capital, of investment in people and in the \r\nstories and freedoms of individual women and men.\r\nThat is why I believe that, while we are living in \r\ndifficult times, we are also living in a time when we \r\nmust, as former Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld \r\nput it, say yes to the future. He also said, “We are not \r\npermitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what \r\nwe put into it is ours”. We are not permitted to choose \r\n38/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nthe frame of our destiny. We are living in a time of \r\nthreats and problems. Yet what we can put into it is \r\nentirely ours. Within this frame of our destiny we can \r\nonce again inspire others with the values of education, \r\nfreedom and peace, so long as we are stay true to our \r\nhistory and hopeful for our future.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Council \r\nof Ministers of the Republic of Italy for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nStatement by Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the President of the European \r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Herman Van Rompuy, \r\nPresident of the European Council, and inviting him to \r\nmake a statement.\r\nMr. Van Rompuy (European Council) (spoke in \r\nFrench): The world today is much more dangerous than \r\nwhen we were together here last year. Fear is stronger \r\nthan hope, I’m afraid. Tragic events have marked \r\nus. More than 200 schoolgirls were abducted and \r\nenslaved. An airliner packed with parents, children, \r\nscientists, tourists and crew members was cut down in \r\nmid-flight. A mountain people were hunted, trapped \r\nand slaughtered. And last week, at sea, 500 people were \r\nshipwrecked, the victims of murderous smugglers.\r\nThose dark episodes disturb us in that they seem \r\nto herald deeper changes. Public opinion is beginning \r\nto fear that the world is slipping through our fingers \r\nand turning to evil. It is as if the political foundation \r\nof our very existence together is being challenged, as \r\nif the way individuals and States relate to one another \r\nis threatened. Our citizens see the rise of obscurantism \r\nand the forces of fanaticism; they see the boundaries of \r\na world of yesterday — of the day before yesterday, of \r\nan insane world — reappearing. Yes, as my countryman \r\nPaul-Henri Spaak said 66 years ago before this same \r\nAssembly, we are afraid. Ours is not the fear of a coward, \r\nbut the fear that a man can and should have when he \r\nlooks to the future and considers all that it may hold of \r\nhorror and tragedy, and the terrible responsibilities in \r\nthat future (see A/PV.147, p. 280).\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWhen the values we share are under pressure, when \r\nthe order of things seems to be unravelling, we must \r\nact. We must bring back our girls and free them from \r\nBoko Haram. We must allow the families of the victims \r\nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 to pay their last \r\nrespects to their loved ones, and keep alive the memory \r\nof the hopeful people drowned in the Mediterranean. \r\nAll of us must also mobilize against the barbaric group \r\nthat is the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). \r\nTogether, we can make the world a safer place again.\r\nWhen looking back upon the past year, the most \r\nbewildering act in our region, for us in Europe, was \r\nthe abrupt and illegal annexation of Crimea in March. \r\nThat violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity triggered the gravest threat to the European \r\nsecurity order in decades. It matters beyond the \r\nEuropean continent. It is about rejecting the use of \r\nforce and about defending the rule of law that upholds \r\nour society of nations. The General Assembly assumed \r\nits responsibility by adopting resolution 68/262 on the \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine. Members defended \r\nthose very values that the Charter of the United Nations \r\nwas built upon. The European Union welcomes the \r\nstrong message that the breaking of rules will not be \r\ntolerated. When you tamper with borders, you tamper \r\nwith peace.\r\nThe European Union stands firm in its solidarity \r\nwith Ukraine. It is the Ukrainian people’s right to \r\ndecide their own political destiny. Europe responded \r\nto aggression and the violation of international law \r\nwith a wide range of political, economic and financial \r\nsanctions. We knew that that could hurt our own \r\neconomies in return, but together with our international \r\npartners, we did not relent, since the stability of the \r\nEuropean house itself was at stake. Now all of us \r\nmust ensure that the peace process launched in Minsk \r\nadvances, and that all parties respect the ceasefire \r\nand abide by the peace plan. The sanctions are not a \r\ngoal in themselves, and they can be revised, provided \r\nthat there is tangible progress. We can rebuild trust if \r\ncommitments are met.\r\nAt the same time, it is essential that Ukraine’s \r\nauthorities move firmly forward on the path of \r\n14-54841 39/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nreforms. Those reforms — economic, political and \r\nconstitutional — will determine the success of a lasting \r\npolitical solution. The country’s political life and \r\nprosperity shall belong to all its citizens. An inclusive \r\nUkraine with a new social contract and a fair balance \r\nbetween the parts and the whole is the best way to \r\nsecure the country’s future.\r\nEuropean Union countries and institutions are \r\nfully committed to supporting Ukraine as it follows \r\nthat path. The European Union Association Agreement \r\nwith the Ukraine, which was ratified just last week \r\nby the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada and the European \r\nParliament, is a compass and an opportunity to help \r\nUkraine transform into the dynamic, modern and open \r\ndemocracy its people deserve. The steps ahead in this \r\ncooperation will take place within the wider picture of \r\nthe peace process. With Russia, our biggest neighbour, \r\nwe are ready to engage and re-establish a basis of trust \r\nand of promises kept.\r\nThere are nearly 200 countries in this world, but \r\nmany thousands of minorities. Clearly, there is no other \r\nway than ensuring inclusiveness, respecting identities \r\nand giving people a voice. As a Belgian and a European, \r\nI know it can be a real effort to stay together. It requires \r\nconstant attention, openness, empathy and willingness \r\nto adjust. Countries do not have to break up to allow \r\nfor multiple, often multi-layered, identities to coexist. \r\nUnity in diversity can work.\r\nThe most pressing concern on all our minds today \r\nis Iraq, Syria and the wider Middle East. I need not \r\nsketch the bleak outlook, sinister deeds or unspeakable \r\nsuffering in the region. What we have seen this past \r\nsummer has nothing to do with Islam. It is the return \r\nof barbaric ghosts from a long-forgotten past and \r\nhorrendous deeds rejecting that we are one humankind \r\nand denying the very basic values of civilization.\r\nAs the Grand Mufti of Egypt said to me two weeks \r\nago, ISIL is abusing the name of Islam and the very \r\nvalues of Islam and of every religion. I welcome the \r\nstatements made and measures taken by the League of \r\nArab States, the Organization for Islamic Cooperation \r\nand Muslim nations against ISIL. It is essential that \r\nthe parties and neighbours most concerned be at the \r\nfrontlines of this common fight, but all of us must do \r\nour share to confront and isolate ISIL, block financial \r\nf lows and weapon f lows, cut off illegal oil revenue and \r\nstop the influx of foreign fighters. European Union \r\nGovernments are working hard on all those fronts.\r\nAs we know from our own national experience, \r\nradicalization can strike anywhere: take the young \r\njihadi fanatic from France who turned torturer in Syria \r\nand, back in Europe, murdered four innocent victims \r\nin the Jewish Museum of Belgium, in my hometown of \r\nBrussels. We need urgent collective action to stop those \r\nforeign fighters from joining ISIL’s ranks, as so many \r\nof us underlined in yesterday’s high-level Security \r\nCouncil meeting (see S/PV.7272). We also must work \r\ntogether to help the affected countries. Iraq’s new \r\nGovernment, which is aiming for inclusive leadership, \r\ndeserves everybody’s full support and certainly has \r\nours.\r\nHowever, the crisis cannot be resolved without a \r\npolitical solution for Syria. We owe it to the almost \r\n200,000 victims and the millions who have had to \r\nf lee their homes. It is quite simply a catastrophe and \r\none of the international community’s biggest failures. \r\nWhat is needed is a comprehensive regional solution. \r\nIt must include, as this summer’s tragic events in \r\nGaza underlined once more, a two-State solution with \r\nan independent, democratic, viable Palestinian State \r\nliving side by side and in peace with Israel and its other \r\nneighbours.\r\nThe violent dynamics are spreading instability in \r\nall directions — into the Sahel region and as far south \r\nas Nigeria, but also to the east. Those dynamics are \r\nfostering terrorism, organized crime, arms f lows, drugs \r\ntrafficking, human smuggling and radicalization, as we \r\nalso see in Libya. I want to pay tribute to France for its \r\nefforts to help, upon their requests, the Governments \r\nof Mali and the Central African Republic to restore the \r\nrule of law and instil inclusiveness and reconciliation \r\nin close collaboration with the African Union, the \r\nUnited Nations and the whole of the European Union. \r\nWe are ready to undertake our responsibility, knowing \r\nthat we Europeans have no self-interested geostrategic \r\nobjectives in the area. We turned that page of history \r\ndecades ago.\r\nA collective approach is important to deal with \r\nanother tragic symptom of an imploding Middle \r\nEast: dramatic migration in the Mediterranean. We \r\nhave seen millions of people f leeing the war in Syria \r\ninto countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. \r\nEuropean lifeguards rescue up to 1,000 people a \r\nweek — people who risk their lives on small boats \r\nacross the Mediterranean, looking for a life free from \r\nfear. Many come from countries where the State \r\n40/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nstructures have crumbled, where violence is endemic \r\nand where people’s most basic needs cannot be met.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe only lasting answer to despair is development. \r\nI wish to pay tribute to the tireless commitment of \r\nthe United Nations and of the Secretary-General to \r\npromoting the development goals, including the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, and to maintaining a level \r\nof ambition for our actions that is commensurate with \r\nthe challenges. I also acknowledge their efforts with \r\nregard to climate challenge, where Europe remains \r\ncommitted at the forefront and will demonstrate that \r\ncommitment at the Paris negotiations next year. I hope \r\nthat all nations — large and small, rich and poor — will \r\nassume their responsibility.\r\nThe Ebola crisis cruelly reminds us that just as the \r\nfuture of a country depends on its health facilities, the \r\nhealth of all may ultimately depend on such structures. \r\nEbola is the modern plague. The teams of doctors, \r\nnurses and volunteers must be strengthened. Europe \r\nstands ready, with others, to help, to relieve and to heal.\r\nThis autumn, we commemorate the centenary of a \r\ngreat conflict that was the first to lead the entire world \r\ninto its destructive spiral. It took the Second World War \r\nfor our nations to pull themselves together and to try \r\nand build peace together, making the birth of our union \r\nof nations possible. Although, since then, we have \r\nmanaged to prevent another world war, we have still \r\nnot put an end to violence between or within States. \r\nWe meet today not to lament the unforgivable but to \r\nnurture hope and to achieve what we must do, that is, \r\nto act together.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe must overcome fear. We must overcome fear \r\nby fighting danger, by restoring justice and by striving \r\nfor peace so that next year, when our society of nations \r\nmeets again in New York, we can say, “The spell of that \r\ndreadful summer of 2014 has been broken. Step by step, \r\nwe are making progress. Patiently but relentlessly, we \r\nare restoring a place for hope.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the European \r\nCouncil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the \r\nEuropean Council, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance and \r\nCorporate Governance of Antigua and Barbuda\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Finance and Corporate Governance of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda.\r\nMr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Corporate Governance of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Gaston Alphonso \r\nBrowne, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and \r\nCorporate Governance of Antigua and Barbuda, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Browne (Antigua and Barbuda): At the \r\noutset, I wish to extend heartiest congratulations to \r\nthe President on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda looks forward to his leadership and guidance \r\nthroughout this session. I also offer congratulations \r\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Ambassador John \r\nAshe, on a job well done and on his unrelenting service \r\nto the United Nations community, particularly small \r\nisland developing States.\r\nI stand before the Assembly as, perhaps, the newest \r\nHead of Government at this sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The political party that I have the \r\nhonour to lead was democratically and overwhelmingly \r\nelected as the Government of Antigua and Barbuda a \r\nlittle more than three months ago. I am probably also \r\namong the youngest of the Heads of Government at \r\nthis gathering. However, although I may be relatively \r\nyoung and my Government new, I have been a steadfast \r\nbeliever in the value of the United Nations from the \r\nfirst moment of my adult consciousness. The idea \r\nthat there could be a world without a machinery for \r\nleaders to gather in one place, with the single purpose \r\nof improving the lives of all humankind, conjures \r\nup images of chaos, carnage and catastrophe too \r\nfrightening to contemplate. While some may argue that \r\nthe United Nations has not always lived up to its noble \r\npurposes and that chaos, carnage and catastrophe have \r\nscarred our planet, I am profoundly aware that, without \r\nthe United Nations, the viciousness and the wounds \r\nwould have been significantly worse.\r\n14-54841 41/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nHowever, even as I rejoice in the existence of the \r\nUnited Nations, I also lament that its largest and most \r\npowerful nations have too often used their privileged \r\npositions to weaken the authority of the Organization in \r\nadvancement of their own narrow interests. It has also \r\nbeen a grave sadness that in the past powerful States \r\nhave circumvented this body in pursuit of their national \r\ngoals, even in defiance of the solidarity of the larger \r\nfamily of nations.\r\nFor those reasons, my Government and the people \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda strongly support the reform \r\nof the Organization. We would like to see reform \r\nthat democratizes the United Nations so as to give a \r\ngreater voice to those countries, such as mine, that \r\nare marginalized in decision-making because we are \r\nconsidered too small to make a difference. We would \r\nalso welcome a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil that ends the anachronism of the veto power \r\nof the five permanent members — a system that has no \r\nlegitimacy in fairness and in the global balance and that \r\nhas often prevented the Security Council from acting in \r\na manner that would command worldwide support and \r\nacclamation.\r\nIt is paradoxical that such nations, particularly \r\nthose that most fiercely advocate respect for democracy \r\nand the rule of law, implement those principles at home \r\nbut decline to implement them abroad. Respect for the \r\nrule of law and for the democratic principle that gives \r\nnations rights that are as inalienable as those of the \r\nindividual in powerful States must become integral to \r\nthe process and systems of governance by which the \r\nworld’s affairs are managed. Indeed, small States, such \r\nas mine, rely on the strength of the United Nations and \r\non international respect for democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw to protect us from incursions on our sovereignty and \r\ndisregard for our rights. Centuries ago, the philosopher \r\nAristotle spoke a compelling truth when he said of the \r\nState:\r\n“A State is not a mere society, having a common \r\nplace, established for the prevention of mutual \r\ncrime and for the sake of exchange ... Political \r\nsociety exists for the sake of noble actions, and not \r\nof mere companionship.”\r\nAristotle’s observation concerning the State \r\nremains valid and legitimate in today’s international \r\nsystem of States, which the United Nations represents. \r\nEvery State within the international system must \r\nrecognize that noble action is one of the purposes of a \r\npolitical community.\r\nIn this regard, I draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nthe fact that 10 long years have passed since my small \r\ncountry, with a population of under 100,000 and an \r\neconomy of $1.1 billion, received a favourable decision \r\nby the Dispute Settlement Body of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) in a complaint against the United \r\nStates, a nation of several hundred million inhabitants \r\nwhose economy is valued in the trillions. Despite the \r\nfavourable judgment, against which the losing party has \r\nappealed without success, the United States Government \r\nhas not seen fit to perform the “noble action” of settling \r\nwith my small State in a manner consistent with the \r\nharm done to our economy. My country has been \r\ndenied income that, had we continued to earn it, would \r\nhave contributed significantly to the welfare of my \r\npeople, and to the capacity of our economy to cope with \r\nthe grave effects of climate change and the financial \r\ncrisis to which we became a casualty. I stress that when \r\nmy country took the United States before the WTO’s \r\nDispute Settlement Body, we did not do so as an act of \r\nhostility to a neighbour with whom we have enjoyed a \r\nlong and friendly relationship; we did so because we \r\nhad a duty to care for our people.\r\nMy small State was the victim of a trade violation. \r\nIn good faith, we sought relief within the international \r\nsystem and the democratic principles and rule of law \r\nthat it is meant to uphold. To be fair, the system delivered \r\njustice. But in so doing, its weakness was exposed when \r\njustice could not be enforced because the powerful \r\nparty that was found against would not settle with the \r\nsmall country that was injured. However, if democracy \r\nand the rule of law are to prevail in our international \r\nsystem, they have to be upheld and respected by the \r\npowerful and cannot simply be imposed upon the weak. \r\nOtherwise, there will be resentment, discontent and \r\npossibly conflict.\r\nYesterday, speaking in this very forum, the \r\nPresident of the United States, Barack Obama, said \r\nthat “right makes might... bigger nations should not be \r\nable to bully smaller ones” (A/69/PV.6, p. 11). If this \r\nuniversal truth is a guiding principle of his Government, \r\nthen the United States cannot continue to approbate and \r\nreprobate on this principle. The noble thing is for the \r\nUnited States to settle this long-outstanding judgement \r\nfairly and expeditiously. In another context, but voicing \r\na similar principle, President Obama said the following \r\na year ago: \r\n42/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\n“[T]he principle of sovereignty is at the centre of \r\nour international order. But sovereignty cannot \r\nbe ... an excuse for the international community to \r\nturn a blind eye” (A/68/PV.5, p. 16). \r\nPresident Obama was perfectly right. That is why I \r\nbelieve he will agree that sovereignty and power should \r\nnot be a shield against the fulfilment of obligations \r\nindependently assessed, or an excuse for not settling \r\nthis very vexing issue.\r\nI am sure that President Obama would also agree \r\nthat the international community cannot turn a blind \r\neye to the blockade imposed on Cuba. Antigua and \r\nBarbuda supports the preservation of the sovereignty \r\nof every nation. We are very proud of our long-standing \r\nrelationship with the Republic of Cuba. We therefore \r\njoin with the international community and condemn any \r\ndiscriminatory and retaliatory policies and practices \r\nthat serve to prevent Cuba from exercising its right \r\nto freely participate in the affairs of the hemisphere. \r\nMy Government firmly believes that any application \r\nof unilateral and extraterritorial coercive laws and \r\nmeasures that conflict with international law and the \r\nprinciples of free navigation and international trade is \r\nwrong. We therefore urge our long-standing friend, the \r\nUnited States, to respect and take note of the numerous \r\ncalls by the United Nations to immediately bring an \r\nend to the unjust economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade imposed on our neighbour Cuba.\r\nMy small country has no military might, no \r\neconomic clout. All that we have is membership of the \r\ninternational system as our shield and our voice in this \r\nbody as our sword. That is why we will continue to \r\nuphold the value of the United Nations vigorously, and \r\nwhy we will join the effort for its reform to make it the \r\nguardian of all nations and all peoples.\r\nI want to express my Government’s full agreement \r\nwith the President’s decision to make the theme of \r\nthis General Assembly debate, “Delivering on and \r\nimplementing a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda.” It is well known now that the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Gap Task Force has reported \r\nmixed progress in the achievement of key targets. \r\nAmong the targets on which there has been insufficient \r\nacceleration has been official development assistance. \r\nI congratulate those countries that have reached the \r\npledged target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income. \r\nHowever, the developed world is still not meeting the \r\ntarget of $315 billion. Indeed, it is not even reaching \r\nhalf that amount.\r\nMy own country and the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) region as a whole have witnessed a decline \r\nin bilateral assistance from larger and richer nations \r\nwithin our own hemisphere, and we have relied on \r\nnon-traditional sources, such as the People’s Republic \r\nof China and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nIn regard to energy, the high cost of which cripples \r\nour country, the Venezuelan Petrocaribe arrangement \r\nhas been a lifebelt in a sea of turbulence. We are also \r\ngrateful for the contributions of our other international \r\npartners, including the European Union. However, as we \r\ngo forward, there is clearly a need for increased global \r\nengagement with respect to development assistance, \r\nincluding the presence at the table of recipients as well \r\nas donors.\r\nIn addition — and as a most urgent matter — the \r\ninternational financial institutions must be urged to stop \r\npenalizing small Caribbean States on the basis of their \r\nf lawed per capita income criterion. Our countries are \r\ndenied access to concessional financing because we are \r\nclassified as middle-income countries. This obdurate \r\nattitude of the international financial institutions in \r\nnot devising better criteria for assessing the eligibility \r\nof our small economies for concessionary financing, \r\nforces us into the commercial lending market. The \r\nconsequence of this is that our debt is rising and many \r\nof us are among the most highly indebted countries in \r\nthe world on a per capita basis.\r\nBut I ask, “What is the alternative?” Rhetorically, \r\nI ask again, “What is the alternative?” It is said that \r\nsix years after the global economy collapsed, jobs are \r\nbeing created, global financial systems have stabilized \r\nand people are once again being lifted out of poverty. \r\nBut I say here this afternoon that this is not a universal \r\ntruth. In the case of small States in the Caribbean, the \r\nglobal economic crisis in 2008 in whose creation we \r\nplayed no part, sent our economies into a tailspin. We \r\nhave yet to recover fully from its impact, and we will \r\nprobably never recover the development ground that we \r\nlost. Incredibly, a significant number of our educated \r\nyoung people are unemployed. If we fail to satisfy their \r\naspirations, we condemn them to a life on the margins of \r\nsociety at best, or a life of crime and violence at worst. \r\nNo nation can opt for so devastating an alternative.\r\nThere is now an urgent need for this United \r\nNations body, through one of its appropriate organs, to \r\naddress the large debt that CARICOM countries have \r\naccumulated owing to declining aid, poor terms of \r\ntrade, the high cost of regulating financial services, and \r\n14-54841 43/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nexpenditure on curbing drug trafficking and stopping \r\nrefugees.\r\nThose countries in the Caribbean, including my \r\nown, that are now increasing their debt are not doing so \r\nbecause of poor policies or because we are not focused \r\non increased productivity and growth, nor are we doing \r\nso because of high expenditures on vanity projects or \r\nunsustainable ventures. We are doing so to build the \r\nsocioeconomic infrastructure to facilitate revenue \r\ngeneration.\r\nThe fact of the matter is that the global crisis that \r\nbegan in 2008 has set our economies back to pre-1974 \r\nlevels. While we are tightening our belts, forging \r\nrelations with the private sector and energetically \r\nseeking foreign direct investment in productive \r\nenterprises, we are scraping our way uphill, having \r\nbeen pushed downwards by a deluge of external factors.\r\nThe United Nations cannot step back from those \r\nrealities, and it would be wrong, as it has been wrong \r\nfor some time, for this Organization to abdicate its \r\nresponsibility for action to multilateral organizations \r\nwhose membership is made up only of a few, however \r\npowerful they may be. Indeed, it is precisely because \r\nthe members of those groups are powerful and because \r\nthey reach into a network of economic and political \r\ndecision-making bodies that can easily impose their \r\nwill on the weak and vulnerable that the United Nations \r\nshould not abandon its responsibilities to the weak, who \r\ndepend on this Organization.\r\nI cannot leave this rostrum without addressing the \r\nwar on terror and the issue of the dreaded Ebola disease. \r\nThe threat of Ebola requires a global response, and we \r\nurge the international community to act collectively \r\nand swiftly in combatting what could become a global \r\npandemic with grave socio-economic consequences for \r\nsmall States, especially our fragile, tourism-dependent \r\ncountries in the Caribbean. Antigua and Barbuda \r\ncommends the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for \r\nits pledge of $5 million towards Ebola eradication and \r\nthe Republic of Cuba for sending 165 doctors. We call \r\non the members of the international community to \r\ncontinue to contribute towards that effort.\r\nAntigua and Barbuda condemns the savage and \r\ncruel acts of the jihadists of the Islamic State, who have \r\nbeheaded three civilians. On behalf of the Government \r\nand people of Antigua and Barbuda, I express our \r\ndeepest sympathy to the families of the victims and \r\nto the people of the United States, France and the \r\nUnited Kingdom for those atrocities. There can be no \r\njustification for such barbaric behaviour. We cannot \r\nafford a world that slips back into the dark ages when \r\nviolence, wars and barbarism were the stock-and-trade \r\nof religious intolerance and ethnic divisions.\r\nYet, as we survey the global scene, there are deeply \r\ntroubling instances of such behaviour in Europe, Africa \r\nand the Middle East. In all this, the role of the United \r\nNations becomes critically important. What is required \r\nis not unilateral acts that will embroil specific nations \r\nin cycles of violent retaliation. What is required is a \r\nUnited Nations whose Member States, particularly \r\nthose on the Security Council, act together to defend \r\npeace and security.\r\nAfter only 100 days in office, my Government \r\nhas demonstrated its commitment to building an all-\r\ninclusive, all-empowering and egalitarian society by \r\npromoting the protection of women’s rights, gender \r\nequality and the rights of the disabled. We see those \r\nissues not only as human rights issues, but as essential \r\ncomponents of sustainable development, peace, social \r\njustice and security. At our first session of Parliament, \r\nmy Government ratified the Convention on the Rights \r\nof Persons with Disabilities. We have gone further and \r\nhave appointed a distinguished son of the soil, who is \r\nvisually challenged, to serve as our representative to \r\nthe United Nations. We have also appointed a plethora \r\nof women to serve in the Upper House of Parliament \r\nas ambassadors and in other key positions within \r\nthe public sector. It is my Government’s pledge to \r\ncontinue to work towards full gender equality and the \r\nadvancement and empowerment of women.\r\nWhen the President of the General Assembly opened \r\nthe Assembly’s sixty-ninth session, he remarked that \r\n“to say that we are living in tumultuous times would \r\nseem an understatement” (A/69/PV.1, p. 3). He noted that \r\nthe entire world is facing challenges such as poverty, \r\nhunger, climate change and rising sea levels, persistent \r\nunemployment, armed conflicts and the Ebola virus \r\nepidemic. He called on this global body to tackle those \r\nchallenges “with dedication, single-mindedness of \r\npurpose and compromise” and “a sense of resolve and \r\nresilience” (ibid.) He was right to do so.\r\nCrises are staring human civilization in the face, \r\nincluding climate change, the Ebola virus and the threat \r\nposed by the Islamic State. As a result, we all face a \r\nfuture where those challenges can only be dealt with \r\nthrough joint international action. The United Nations, \r\n44/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nthe parliament of parliaments, is the place where such \r\njoint action is to be decided and implemented. We need \r\nto strengthen the United Nations capacity for such \r\naction, whether military or humanitarian. There is no \r\nsubstitute for the United Nations. Antigua and Barbuda \r\npledges its continued support of and participation in the \r\nwork of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Corporate Governance of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Corporate Governance \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak \r\nAl-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak \r\nAl-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Kuwait, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nSheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, it pleases me to extend, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and people of the State of Kuwait, our \r\nsincere congratulations to the President of the General \r\nAssembly and to his friendly country, Uganda, on \r\nhis election as President of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. We are certain that his vast experience \r\nin international affairs will enable him to conduct the \r\ndeliberations of the Assembly at this session wisely and \r\nably, and we wish him success in that endeavour. We \r\nalso note with praise the successful manner in which his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. John Ashe, conducted \r\nthe deliberations during his presidency of the previous \r\nsession.\r\nIn that regard, I would also like to pay tribute to the \r\ntremendous efforts exerted by His Excellency Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon in leading the Organization, in \r\naccordance with the visions and ideas derived from \r\nthe principles and purposes of the Charter, to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security and achieve its goals in \r\na sustainable manner by confronting the kinds of risks \r\nand challenges engulfing the world, whether they be \r\nchronic or recent.\r\nIn its nearly 70 years of existence and service, the \r\nUnited Nations has witnessed increasing challenges, \r\nas represented by numerous incidents and crises, and \r\nhas overcome exceptional political and economic \r\nmilestones. That has made it a haven and a destination \r\nfor all the peoples and nations of the world, bestowed \r\nupon the Organization a wider scope of action to contain \r\ncrises and given it a more significant role in reaching \r\nsolutions and achieving further accomplishments.\r\nHowever, the deep-rooted and wide-ranging \r\ninternational transformations of the past few years have \r\nmade the continuation of the Organization, based on \r\nits current executive mechanisms and administrative \r\nstructures, an obstacle to achieving its historic mission. \r\nWhen we speak of change for the better, it is crucial \r\nto seek comprehensive reform by proposing scenarios \r\nand solutions aimed at reviving the Organization, its \r\norgans and its specialized agencies in order to ensure \r\nthe enhancement and development of their capacity to \r\nbecome more proactive, in line with modern times, and \r\nto deepen their understanding of the basic requirements \r\nof Member States.\r\nReform should start with the Security Council, as \r\nthe organ entrusted with the maintaining international \r\npeace and security and the closest to reality; it is also \r\nthe most effective and is already predisposed to measure \r\nits accomplishments according to its mandates. The \r\nState of Kuwait, which currently presides over the Arab \r\nSummit and coordinates the Arab Group, would like \r\nto stress the importance of thoroughly and carefully \r\naddressing the structural f laws in the composition \r\nof the Council, in particular the issue of expanding \r\nthe category of permanent membership by ensuring \r\npermanent Arab representation in the Council, based \r\non the demographic dimension of the Arab Members, \r\nwhose population exceeds 350 million and whose \r\nnumber increased from five States in 1945 to 22 at \r\npresent. That represents nearly 12 per cent of the total \r\nnumber of States Members of the United Nations, in \r\naddition to the fact that the issues relating to the Arab \r\nStates and their region top the agenda of the Council.\r\n14-54841 45/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nSeveral countries of the Middle East are facing \r\ntremendous security, political and humanitarian \r\nchallenges and an exceptional situation, due to the \r\ninability of the Security Council to carry out its \r\nfunctions, which has led to the aggravation and \r\ndeterioration of the situation in many States of the \r\nregion. The recent Israeli military aggression against \r\nthe Gaza Strip lasted for 50 consecutive days, during \r\nwhich the non-stop killing and machine of destruction \r\ncontinuously targeted everything human, mowing \r\ndown thousands of unarmed civilians, the majority \r\nof them elderly, women and children. That action \r\nappears to have been emblematic of the series of Israeli \r\nviolations of the most basic rules of international law \r\nand international humanitarian law, and constitutes \r\nyet another addition to its bloody history of rejecting \r\nall regional and international initiatives to lay the \r\nfoundations of a just and lasting peace.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the \r\nceasefire agreement signed on 26 August, as well as the \r\ninternational and regional initiatives undertaken to end \r\nto that crisis and aggression, primarily those promoted \r\nby our sister Arab Republic of Egypt. In that context, \r\nwe renew our call on the Security Council to assume \r\nits responsibility to provide international protection \r\nto the Palestinian people and territory, pursuant to the \r\nprovisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, \r\nand to compel Israel, the occupying Power, to halt its \r\nunilateral practices aimed at imposing a policy of faits \r\naccomplis, such as illegal settlements and the unlawful \r\nsiege of the Gaza Strip, in addition to attempts to \r\nchange the demographic nature of Jerusalem by means \r\nof Judaization. Israel must be compelled to return to the \r\nnegotiating table with a view to ending its occupation \r\nof all Palestinian and Arab lands, as well to achieve the \r\nestablishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, in accordance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, the principle of land for peace, the \r\nroad map and the Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nAs the crisis in Syria, now entering its fourth year, \r\nescalates into a bloodier phase, our concern about the \r\npotential regional and international repercussions of the \r\nfailure of that State has given way to anxiety about the \r\nexacerbation of the cycle of violence, which has already \r\nclaimed the lives of more than 190,000 people, created \r\n3 million refugees and displaced another 6 million \r\npeople. In that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2165 (2014) on opening \r\nnew border crossings to deliver aid to the affected \r\nSyrian people. We hope that all concerned will pool \r\ntheir efforts to ensure the swiftest possible delivery \r\nof humanitarian assistance to the Syrian people in the \r\nbesieged areas and throughout Syrian territory and \r\nbeyond.\r\nIn response to the ripple effects of that intensifying \r\nhumanitarian crisis, the State of Kuwait hosted two \r\ninternational donor conferences, in January 2013 and \r\nJanuary 2014, to support the humanitarian situation in \r\nSyria. Pledges made at those two conferences totaled \r\n$3.8 billion, of which the State of Kuwait contributed \r\n$800 million. That sum was delivered in its entirety to \r\nspecialized United Nations agencies, as well as to other \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nconcerned with humanitarian affairs. In that regard, \r\nwe reiterate the importance of continued regional and \r\ninternational efforts to reach a political solution that \r\nsatisfies the aspirations of the Syrian people for a free \r\nand decent life, according to the Geneva communiqué, \r\nand that preserve Syria’s unity, security and stability.\r\nWith respect to the sisterly Republic of Yemen, \r\nthe State of Kuwait, as the current chair of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council, has sought within its mandate \r\nto establish peace and stability in Yemen, and to fulfil \r\nthe aspirations of its people for development and \r\nprosperity, in accordance with the Gulf States initiative \r\nand its executive mechanism. However, tensions due \r\nto the continued rivalry between some factions, along \r\nwith the resulting deterioration in the security and \r\npolitical situations, are a source of concern, because \r\nof their potential negative impact on the future of the \r\npolitical process in Yemen. They also pose a threat \r\nto the country’s unity and territorial integrity. We \r\nreiterate our full support for enforcing the outcome \r\nof the national dialogue and for addressing the acts \r\nof violence and terrorism that some separatist groups \r\ncontinue to provoke.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Libya, the State of \r\nKuwait renews its support to the legitimately elected \r\nLibyan Government, as an integral complement to the \r\nprocess of democratic transformation that will ensure \r\nthe security, unity and territorial integrity of Libya. \r\nThe State of Kuwait also emphasizes the need for the \r\ninternational community and the Security Council \r\nto honour their commitments by fully adhering to \r\nresolution 2174 (2014), in order to guarantee a better \r\nfuture for Libya and its people.\r\n46/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nWithin the same region, concerning Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme, the State of Kuwait supports the ongoing \r\nefforts to resolve that issue by peaceful means and in a \r\nmanner that will guarantee the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\nand all the countries of the region the right to use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes, under the supervision and \r\nmonitoring of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA). We also emphasize the importance of reaching \r\ninternational agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme, \r\nbased on full Iranian commitment to cooperating with \r\nthe IAEA, implementing all relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and enforcing the highest standards of \r\nsafety and security in its nuclear facilities.\r\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its principled and \r\nfirm rejection of all forms of terrorism and extremism, \r\nwhatever their reasons, motives or sources. It also \r\nbelieves that promoting the culture of tolerance and \r\ncoexistence among peoples and nations should be a \r\npriority in its internal and external policies, which are \r\nderived from the tolerant teachings of Islamic Sharia. \r\nThe State of Kuwait emphasizes its full support for \r\nall international efforts to combat and put an end to \r\nthe terrorist threats facing the world, which aim to \r\nundermine the elements of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Kuwait welcomes resolution 2178 (2014) \r\nadopted yesterday by the Security Council, reinforcing \r\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism and foreign \r\nfighters.\r\nIn that regard, we denounce the actions of the so-\r\ncalled Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as \r\nwell as its terroristic practices and acts of aggression in \r\nparts of Iraqi and Syrian territory. We equally condemn \r\nISIL’s grave violations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law. We reiterate our commitment \r\nto support the efforts and endeavours of the Iraqi \r\nGovernment to overcome the destructive scourge of \r\nterrorism that currently threatens its security, stability \r\nand territorial integrity and that is adversely and clearly \r\naffecting the political process in that country.\r\nThe giant leap represented by new communications \r\ntechnologies, thanks to which the United Nations has \r\nbeen able to expand the reach of its lofty message, \r\nhas also increased the complexity of monitoring \r\nand assessing the fast-paced global environment, as \r\nwell as handling its output and consequences. The \r\naggregate expertise and experience represented in our \r\nOrganization at the professional, technical and political \r\nlevels is embodied in the United Nations Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). The Declaration’s clearly \r\nidentified priorities and simple terms have played a \r\nmajor and significant role in improving the lives of \r\nmillions of people in many regions of the world. The \r\nDeclaration has also set an example by demonstrating \r\nthe importance of partnership in international \r\nwork, through cooperation and coordination among \r\nGovernments, and the promotion of the role of civil \r\nsociety organizations and the private sector.\r\nBy drawing on modern technology and scientific \r\nadvances, the Millennium Development Goals \r\nhave provided the peoples and nations of the world \r\nwith renewed hope for creating a better world, and \r\nhave created an incentive to achieve them. The \r\nOrganization has encouraged Member States to \r\ndevise a comprehensive and ambitious post-2015 \r\ndevelopment plan with sustainable development \r\nin all three dimensions — economic, social and \r\nenvironmental — at its core. That plan will address \r\nnew dangers and challenges and anticipate future \r\nconditions, which will be different from those we face \r\ntoday.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait welcomes the \r\nClimate Summit that the Secretary-General convened \r\ntwo days ago, and reiterates that climate change has \r\nnegative repercussions on development throughout the \r\nworld and in the Arab region in particular. There is a \r\nclear need for international action and solidarity within \r\nthe framework of the sustainable development goals, \r\naccording to the principle of shared but differentiated \r\nresponsibility, in order to guarantee that all States \r\nbenefit equally from the new agenda. In that regard, \r\nspecial attention and treatment should be provided to \r\nthe developing countries, which are the States most \r\nadversely affected by climate change.\r\nSince winning its independence and joining the \r\nglobal Organization, the State of Kuwait has never \r\nbeen far removed from the crises and challenges \r\nfacing the world. Our founding fathers defined a \r\npurely humanitarian approach to helping the needy \r\nand restoring hope to those who have lost it, bypassing \r\nthe traditional bases for giving, which were largely \r\nrooted in geographic location, ethnic origin or political \r\naffiliation. Their sons have followed that approach, \r\ngiving greater priority to contemporary trends \r\nthrough the pillars that define our foreign policy. That \r\ncommitment rests on devising and developing methods \r\nfor providing assistance and aid to the majority of the \r\nworld’s countries by promoting activities that would \r\nsupport the message of the United Nations in creating \r\n14-54841 47/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\na world in which security and stability prevail, and \r\npeople live in peace and prosperity.\r\nThe establishment in 1961 of the Kuwait Fund \r\nfor Arab Economic Development was an expression \r\nof the sincere desire of the State of Kuwait to support \r\nthe development efforts of Arab States and friendly \r\ncountries by providing soft loans and technical \r\nassistance. In pursuing that approach, and in order to \r\nshow its keen interest in supporting the humanitarian \r\nrole of the United Nations, the State of Kuwait has \r\ndoubled the amount of its fixed annual voluntary \r\ncontributions to a number of international agencies \r\nand organizations, including its recent donation to the \r\nWorld Health Organization to combat the spread of the \r\nEbola virus in West Africa, giving wider horizons and \r\nbroader reach to the humanitarian work of the State of \r\nKuwait.\r\nOur wide-ranging diplomatic efforts at the regional \r\nand international levels, led by His Highness Sheikh \r\nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the \r\nState of Kuwait, were recognized by the international \r\ncommunity with an exceptional and unprecedented \r\ninternational honour when the Secretary-General \r\npresented His Highness with a certificate of appreciation \r\nin recognition of the outstanding role in humanitarian \r\nleadership played by His Highness, the Government \r\nand the people of the State of Kuwait in saving the lives \r\nof millions of people.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to emphasize that the \r\nState of Kuwait adheres to the multilateral international \r\nsystem, as well as to the principles and purposes of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Kuwait believes \r\nin the critical importance of furthering all efforts to \r\nensure the continuity of our venerable Organization \r\nby ensuring that all States fulfil their responsibilities \r\nand commitments under international conventions \r\nand conferences in order to help find just and lasting \r\nsolutions to global threats and challenges, and to reach \r\nthe loftier goal of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait for the statement just made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Victor-Viorel Ponta, Prime \r\nMinister of Romania\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Romania.\r\nMr. Victor-Viorel Ponta, Prime Minister of \r\nRomania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Victor-Viorel Ponta, \r\nPrime Minister of Romania, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Ponta (Romania): It is a great honour for \r\nme to address the General Assembly today on behalf \r\nof the Romanian delegation. At the outset, allow me \r\nto congratulate the Honourable Sam Kutesa on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session and to assure him of the full support \r\nof the Romanian delegation in fulfilling his high \r\nresponsibility and functions.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs this is the first time I have had the honour to \r\nparticipate in this high-level debate, let me reaffirm \r\nmy country’s peaceful mission as a promoter of peace \r\nand international security, the values of democracy, \r\nthe rule of law and respect for human rights. The \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/69/1) over the past year again confirms \r\nthat cooperation among Member States, based on \r\nthe principles of the United Nations and in a spirit \r\nof solidarity, can meet the current challenges of our \r\npeoples.\r\nI would like to address some issues of interest to \r\nmy country in regard to developments in international \r\nrelations. Since the General Assembly’s general debate \r\na year ago, the area of international security has \r\nwitnessed the most complex and serious developments \r\nsince the end of the cold war. In that context, we have \r\na duty to reaffirm our commitment to the principles of \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, \r\nthe non-use of force and the peaceful resolution of \r\nall problems between States, in accordance with \r\ninternational law.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOne of the crises of utmost concern to my country \r\nis the current situation in Ukraine, given its impact \r\non the security of the countries in Eastern Europe. \r\nThe crisis started, as the Assembly knows, with the \r\n48/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nunilateral annexation of Crimea, an integral part of \r\nthe sovereign State of Ukraine. That action on the \r\nEuropean continent, unprecedented in recent decades, \r\nwas followed by an internal conflict in the eastern \r\nregions of Ukraine, generated by forces pursuing \r\nseparatist goals. I wish to reconfirm our clear and firm \r\nnational position on the crisis in Ukraine. Romania \r\nrejects any form of external pressure on States in \r\nEastern Europe with aspirations to achieve integration \r\nwith Europe. Romania firmly supports the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and all countries. \r\nA strong, united and sovereign Ukraine, committed to \r\nits European path and to reforms in the economic and \r\npolitical fields, is in the best interests of Europe and the \r\nwhole world.\r\nThe international community has been involved in \r\nfinding a solution to the crisis from its beginning. We \r\ncommend the United Nations for its constant presence in \r\nthe field and the efforts of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe to monitor the day-by-day \r\ndevelopments on the ground and to support the whole \r\ninternational effort through its specific mechanisms.\r\nFor many years, all countries of Eastern Europe \r\nand the Black Sea region have shared and openly \r\ndeclared the common goals of peace and cooperation. \r\nBut instability and grave security concerns, such as in \r\nUkraine, in Transdnistria, Ossetia and Abkhazia, and \r\nnow in Donetsk, continue to pose obstacles to those \r\ngoals. We must condemn aggression. We should not \r\nlose trust in the rule of international law. We should \r\nnot lose faith in the benefits of cooperation, and we \r\nshould all strive to prevent a spillover of the current \r\ncrisis. The region has always been a bridge between \r\nCentral Asia and Europe. At this juncture, we have \r\na historical responsibility to assume, protect and \r\npreserve the potential for collaboration, cooperation \r\nand development in that part of Europe.\r\nSituated at the crossroads of the Danube and Black \r\nSea regions, as well as serving as a bridge between \r\nNorthern Europe and the Balkans, Romania is fully \r\naware that regional cooperation is key for ensuring \r\nregional stability, for building confidence and for \r\npromoting the universal principles and values of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Joint initiatives on the \r\neconomy, environment, infrastructure and cross-border \r\ncooperation have a long-term impact on all countries in \r\nour region. As a European Union member, Romania is \r\nan active contributor to the European Union Strategy \r\nfor the Danube Region, to the Black Sea Synergy and to \r\nthe South-East European Cooperation Process.\r\nWe praise the solidarity expressed by the European \r\nUnion and transatlantic partners in supporting a \r\nsustainable path for democracy and development in the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia, assisting \r\nthem to freely achieve their European aspirations. \r\nIt was 75 years ago, based on the infamous Molotov-\r\nRibbentrop Pact, that parts of Romania and some other \r\nindependent States were dismantled. We have learned \r\nthat history must not be an excuse for justifying actions \r\nagainst other countries. On the contrary, our answer to \r\nany temptation based on past history is strong support \r\nfor democratic development, respect for the right to \r\ndemocratically choose one’s future, and respect for \r\ninternational law.\r\nI want to state that position clearly, on behalf of \r\nmy country, as an expression of our democratic identity \r\nand responsible conduct in our relations with all our \r\nneighbours, and when speaking about the democratic \r\nfuture of all the countries in those regions, including \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Georgia. The \r\ndesire to turn the extended Black Sea region into an \r\narea of peace, stability and prosperity should continue \r\nto guide our cooperation. We express our support, one \r\nagain, for a democratic, secure and stable region, and \r\nwe encourage our regional and international partners \r\nto broaden our solidarity with Ukraine, Moldova and \r\nGeorgia.\r\nA source of concern to all of us is the multiplication \r\nof political, security and strategic challenges in the \r\nsouthern neighbourhood of the European Union and in \r\nthe Middle East. The proliferation of radical Islamist \r\nmovements and the emergence of new groups, such as \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), have led \r\nto an enhanced terrorist threat. They represent a new \r\nbreed of terrorism, which threatens to destabilize the \r\nentire Middle East and the world. ISIS goes beyond Iraq \r\nand Syria, and therefore represents a major challenge to \r\nthe international order and must be dealt with by all \r\nStates. We must all stand united and fight terrorism \r\nwherever it arises. I want to express my country’s firm \r\nsupport for building solidarity in confronting this new \r\nchallenge.\r\nIn the field of development, we believe that the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly is crucial \r\nfor the preparation of the post-2015 sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda, which will guide our actions in \r\n14-54841 49/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\ncoming decades. As a member of the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals, Romania \r\nmade its contribution to that very important process, in \r\naccordance with the decisions taken at United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development. Our national \r\nvision of the future goals was adopted by the Government \r\nof Romania in December 2013, and we are pleased to \r\nsee that our areas of interest are reflected in the report \r\nof the Open Working Group (see A/67/941). The future \r\ndevelopment agenda should address poverty eradication \r\nand sustainable development, good governance and the \r\nrule of law. However, it should also provide a platform \r\nfor social inclusion and the reduction of unemployment, \r\ngiving our present and future generations of young \r\npeople confidence and hope.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nOver the past year, the number of people in need \r\nof humanitarian assistance, especially the number of \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons, has grown \r\nto unprecedented levels. We commend and support \r\nthe assistance provided to those persons by the United \r\nNations system in close cooperation with international \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and \r\ninternational donors. Despite our limited financial \r\nresources, we have made efforts to contribute to the \r\nprocess of assisting refugees.\r\nIn that respect, I would like to mention the activities \r\nof the emergency transit centre in Timisoara, Romania, \r\nestablished by the Romanian Government, the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nand the International Organization for Migration. The \r\ncentre, the first of its kind in the world, has proved to be a \r\nfeasible mechanism offering safety to persons in urgent \r\nneed of international protection, thereby becoming a \r\npractical expression of the human security concept. \r\nThat contribution reflects the responsible conduct that \r\nRomania has always adopted in facing global challenges. \r\nWe will continue to contribute to international efforts \r\nwith the same dedication and responsibility as our \r\ntroops and civil experts have already shown in several \r\nareas, such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo, or places \r\nin Africa.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe year 2014 has particular resonance for Romania \r\nand brings us closer to our national centennial, \r\nwhich we will celebrate in 2018. In 1989, Romanians \r\nchose democracy and respect for human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. We encountered difficulties, \r\nbut our resolve led us to a successful transition.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our firm \r\nand continuing commitment to the Organization and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and their governing \r\nvalues  and principles. Romania will continue to uphold \r\ninternational law and the principle of the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts, while promoting human rights \r\nin order to achieve prosperity for all.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Romania for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Victor-Viorel Ponta, Prime Minister of \r\nRomania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Commonwealth of Australia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by Mr. Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia.\r\nMr. Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Commonwealth of Australia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Abbott (Australia): In what can seem to be \r\ndarkening times, I want to begin with a message of \r\nhope. Amid all our problems, the murderous rage of \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Syria and \r\nIraq, Russian aggression in Ukraine, the spread of \r\nEbola in West Africa and the stubborn sluggishness of \r\nmany economies, let me start with a small but telling \r\nillustration of nations working together to serve our \r\ncommon humanity. Last March, at the height of the \r\nsearch for the missing Flight MH-70, I went to the Pearce \r\nairbase in Western Australia to thank all the aviators \r\ninvolved. There were personnel from Australia, New \r\nZealand, Malaysia and the United States — countries \r\nthat are accustomed to working together. There were \r\nalso personnel from China, Japan and Korea — countries \r\nwhose relations sometimes labour under the weight of \r\nhistorical grievances.\r\n50/51 14-54841\r\nA/69/PV.9 25/09/2014\r\nOn that occasion, however, the tragedy and a \r\ndaunting challenge drew out the best in everyone. \r\nThe Organization was founded on the principle that \r\nwe should work together for the common good and \r\nthat, over time, talking together and working together \r\nwill improve our capacity for living together. Like \r\nany institution, the United Nations is an imperfect \r\ninstrument. Still, it is better than “might is right”, and \r\nit gives good arguments the best chance to prevail.\r\nDespite faults and failures, the United Nations \r\nhas worked for peace and progress for nearly 70 years. \r\nAustralia has been proud to play its part, starting in \r\n1946, when we held the first presidency of the Security \r\nCouncil and helped to draft the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights. At the heart of the Organization is the \r\nprinciple that we should act towards others as we would \r\nhave them act towards us. For almost seven decades, \r\nAustralia has believed in the potential of the United \r\nNations and supported its work. Keeping commitments, \r\nvaluing human life, protecting property and extending \r\nfreedom are universal aspirations, not only Australian \r\nones.\r\nSince 1947, we have provided more than 65,000 \r\npersonnel to more than 50 multilateral peace and \r\nsecurity operations. We are not a country accustomed to \r\nturning back, once we have put our hand to the plough. \r\nWe have had Blue Beret personnel in the Middle East \r\nsince 1956 and in Cyprus since 1964. When leadership \r\nis needed, we step up, as we did in Bougainville, \r\nin Timor-Leste and in Solomon Islands. In Korea, \r\nCambodia, Kuwait and Afghanistan and in Somalia, \r\nSierra Leone and other troubled places, Australians \r\nhave lent a hand under the United Nations banner. We \r\nhave only 21 personnel in South Sudan now but have \r\nconducted an airlift of equipment that has supported a \r\nmuch larger force.\r\nWith just 24 million people, Australia is a relatively \r\nsmall country, but we have the world’s twelfth- \r\nlargest economy, with global interests and with some \r\nglobal reach. We are strong enough to be useful but \r\npragmatic enough to know our limits. Under successive \r\nGovernments, for more than 100 years, Australia’s \r\ndetermination has been to advance our interests, \r\nto protect our citizens and to uphold our values. \r\nWe have never believed that we can save the world \r\nsingle-handedly, nor have we shrunk from shouldering \r\nour responsibilities. After the 2004 East Asian tsunami, \r\nwe committed $1 billion to Indonesia. We were one of \r\nthe first countries to arrive with help in Japan after the \r\n2011 earthquake and in the Philippines after the 2013 \r\ntyphoon.\r\nTo date, we have pledged $8 million towards \r\ncombating the Ebola outbreak, and dozens of Australian \r\nhealth professionals are working with international \r\nagencies in the region. To us, this is all part of being a \r\ngood global citizen. Last July, we were pleased to sponsor \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2166 (2014) and to work \r\nwith the Dutch and the Malaysians to investigate the \r\ncrash site and recover our dead, after Malaysia Airlines \r\nFlight MH-17 was shot down by Russian-backed rebels \r\nover eastern Ukraine. We are grateful for the help that \r\nUkraine gave us, and are naturally sympathetic to a \r\ncountry struggling to preserve its independence and \r\nterritorial integrity against a bully. With the Dutch and \r\nthe Malaysians, we will do everything we can to ensure \r\nthat the investigation is not undermined, and that the \r\ncrime is not covered up, because that is our duty to the \r\n38 Australians murdered in this atrocity.\r\nRight now, an Australian force has been deployed \r\nto the Middle East, so that we can join a coalition \r\nseeking to disrupt and degrade the Islamic State of \r\nIraq and the Levant terrorist movement at the request \r\nof the Iraqi Government. One of our prime ministers \r\nonce talked about our country’s great objective, “our \r\nlight on the hill,” as he put it, namely, to work for the \r\nbetterment of mankind, not just at home, but wherever \r\nwe can lend a helping hand. To build a better world, \r\nwe need to respond sensibly to the problems before us, \r\nwhether through bodies such as the United Nations, \r\nor in coalitions with like-minded countries. We also \r\nneed to work purposefully to create stronger and more \r\nresilient people and communities. A stronger economy \r\nwill not solve every problem, but it will make almost \r\nevery problem easier to tackle. Richer people are not \r\nnecessarily better people, but the problems of plenty \r\nare invariably easier to deal with than those of want.\r\nAs this year’s Chair of the Group of Twenty (G-\r\n20), Australia is determined to promote private-sector-\r\nled growth: growth, because that is the best way \r\nto generate jobs and improve everyone’s quality of \r\nlife; private-sector-led, because profitable, private \r\nbusinesses are the best source of real, sustainable \r\nwealth. Freer trade, more investment in infrastructure, \r\na modern and fair international tax system, stronger \r\nglobal economic institutions and a more resilient \r\nfinancial sector are all parts of our G-20 agenda to \r\nstrengthen the world economy.\r\n14-54841 51/51\r\n25/09/2014 A/69/PV.9\r\nRather than preaching, we are trying to lead by \r\nexample. Australia has abolished the carbon tax and \r\nthe mining tax, and we have provided environmental \r\napprovals for $800 billion worth of new projects. We \r\nhave also begun the task of eliminating our budget \r\ndeficit within four years. We have finalized a series of \r\ntrade deals, because every time a country trades with \r\nanother, wealth increases, and when wealth increases, \r\ncountries grow stronger. Our G-20 goal is to boost \r\noutput by an extra 2 per cent over the next five years \r\nto create millions of jobs and to generate trillions in \r\nwealth right around the world.\r\nLikewise, the post-2015 development agenda \r\nshould also focus on economic growth, because growth \r\nmakes every other social goal, even tackling climate \r\nchange, easier to accomplish. To people who do not \r\nknow where their next meal is coming from, talk of \r\neconomic growth can seem ignorant or indulgent. But \r\n“economic growth” is really just economists’ shorthand \r\nfor more jobs, higher pay, new industries and the better \r\nlife that only greater wealth can provide. Economic \r\ngrowth might seem a mundane vision, but it allows \r\nmillions more people to create their own vision of how \r\ntheir lives can be better.\r\nTo anyone who doubts that stronger economic \r\ngrowth can be achieved, I say, “Look at the countries \r\nof East Asia”. In scarcely two generations, the rise \r\nof Asia has driven the greatest social and economic \r\ntransformation in history. People live longer, they are \r\nbetter educated, wealthier and, yes, they enjoy a level \r\nof freedom and stability that their parents could only \r\ndream of. In Japan, Korea and now China, in India and \r\nincreasingly in Indonesia, many hundreds of millions \r\nof people have been lifted from poverty to the middle \r\nclass. Almost certainly, that is the greatest and fastest \r\nadvance in human welfare of all time.\r\nWhile all Governments, Australia’s included, could \r\nalways be better, smarter and more compassionate, \r\nno one should be blind to the great progress that has \r\noccurred. We live in the most remarkable age in human \r\nhistory. For all the work that remains to be done, we \r\nhave seen more change for the better than at any other \r\ntime.\r\nAs the General Assembly session meets with \r\nsuch pressing issues before it, our challenge — as \r\nalways — is to realize our best hopes and to be our best \r\nselves. Australians have two defining characteristics: \r\nwe believe in a “fair go”, because innate decency \r\ndemands that every person have a chance to contribute. \r\nWe also believe in “having a go”, because rolling up \r\nyour sleeves will always produce a better result than \r\nstanding on the sidelines complaining. That readiness \r\nto make an effort for a good cause is why Australia \r\nfeels so comfortable in this body and is so ready to \r\ncontribute to its work. We should put no limits on what \r\nwe can achieve, especially when we work together, trust \r\npeople and are faithful to our deepest values.\r\nEvery country counts. Every argument must be \r\nweighed. Every person has equal rights and dignity. \r\nEvery person deserves respect. All people are entitled \r\nto make their own choices — provided they do not \r\ninfringe on the rights of others. Those are the principles \r\nthat this Organization embodies and on which the \r\nfuture of humanity rests.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth \r\nof Australia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tony Abbott, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.20 p.m.\r\n"
