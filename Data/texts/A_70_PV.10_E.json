It is my great pleasure to participate in this \r\nhistoric meeting and to assure the Assembly of Austria’s \r\nfull commitment to this Summit and to the 17 specific \r\nGoals endorsed by the international community in that \r\nimportant document. \r\nOur world has changed significantly since we \r\nadopted the Millennium Development Goals 15 years \r\nago. We are faced with some old challenges and \r\nmany new ones, such as rapid population growth, \r\nthe depletion of natural resources, the serious effects \r\nof climate change and massive refugee f lows. The \r\nquestion of how to ensure sustainable development for \r\nfuture generations has become more urgent than ever.\r\nThe year 2015 is a year for the international \r\ncommunity to take important decisions. Three \r\nmajor conferences will help to shape the path to a \r\nsustainable future. The third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa \r\nin July, provided us with a new global framework for \r\nfinancing sustainable development. The United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference to be held in December in \r\nParis will be critical to our collective efforts in tackling \r\nclimate change. Paris can and must be a success. We \r\nneed a global, comprehensive and legally binding Paris \r\nagreement that reflects the highest level of commitment \r\nfrom everyone to reach our 2° Celsius target. We all \r\nknow that reaching an agreement will not be easy, \r\nbut I can assure the Assembly that in Austria and the \r\nEuropean Union, we will do everything we can to make \r\nthe twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties \r\na success.\r\nToday, I would like to mention the invaluable \r\ncontribution of the Intergovernmental Panel on \r\nClimate Change (IPCC) in providing scientific data \r\nand analysis. In October, it will elect a new Bureau. \r\nI am pleased to announce that Austria has nominated \r\nMr. Nebojša Nakićenović, an internationally renowned \r\nand respected scientist, to chair the IPCC, and I hope \r\nthe Assembly will be able to support that excellent \r\ncandidate.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.10\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n10th plenary meeting\r\nSunday, 27 September 2015, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nNow a summit has convened to adopt the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, a new milestone \r\non the road to global sustainable development. The \r\nAgenda is the outcome of nearly three years of \r\nconsultations among Member States, international \r\norganizations and civil society on an unprecedented \r\nscale. Preparatory conferences, such as the second \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, which Austria was pleased to host in \r\nNovember 2014, helped us to focus our attention on the \r\nmost fragile countries.\r\nThe new 2030 Agenda provides us with a blueprint \r\nof how to achieve a better, more just world for all. The \r\nSustainable Development Goals build on and complete \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, and they are \r\nuniversal and applicable to every single country. The \r\n2030 Agenda makes one thing very clear: no one must be \r\nleft behind. Austria takes that message very seriously, \r\nwhich is why, in addition to providing development \r\naid to other countries, the Austrian Government has \r\nmade education, the rule of law and access to justice \r\npriorities of its national work programme for the years \r\n2013-2018, with a particular focus on youth, women, \r\nthe elderly and persons with disabilities.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda presents us with the opportunity \r\nto make sustainable development a reality. To sum \r\nup, I want to reiterate Austria’s commitment to the \r\nnew Agenda and its successful implementation at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nThe President: I thank the Federal President of the \r\nRepublic of Austria for his statement.\r\nMr. Heinz Fischer, Federal President of the \r\nRepublic of Austria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Rousseff (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) outlines the \r\nfuture we want. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals \r\nreaffirm the basic tenet of the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development, namely, that it is indeed \r\npossible to grow, include, preserve and protect. As \r\nsuch, the Goals are clear-cut and genuinely universal. \r\nThey highlight the need for further cooperation among \r\nthe peoples of the world and point towards a shared path \r\nahead for humankind.\r\nThe innovative Agenda requires global solidarity, \r\ndetermination from each one of us and a commitment \r\nto confronting climate change by overcoming poverty \r\nand creating opportunities for all. We must strengthen \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange by ensuring that its principles are implemented \r\nand respected. Our obligations should be ambitious \r\nand consistent with the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities. The upcoming twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nFramework Convention, to be held in Paris, is a unique \r\nopportunity for us to build a joint common response to \r\nthe global challenge of climate change.\r\nBrazil has been making vigorous efforts to reduce \r\nits greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the \r\nsocial inclusion component of its social and economic \r\ndevelopment. To that end, we continue to diversify the \r\nrenewable sources in our energy mix, which is among \r\nthe cleanest in the world. We are currently investing in \r\nlow-carbon agriculture. We have reduced deforestation \r\nin the Amazon rainforest by 82 per cent. The Assembly \r\ncan rest assured that we will continue to undertake such \r\nambitious actions.\r\nOn this occasion, I would like to announce \r\nthat Brazil intends to contribute to the reduction of \r\ngreenhouse emissions by eliminating 37 per cent of \r\nits emissions by 2025. Our goal is to reduce emissions \r\nby 43 per cent by 2030. May I remind the Assembly \r\nthat the baseline year in both cases is 2005. In the same \r\ncontext, by 2030 Brazil intends to adopt measures with \r\nregard to agriculture, livestock and land use that will \r\neliminate illegal deforestation, restore and reforest \r\n12 million hectares, recover 15 million hectares of \r\ndegraded pastures, and create 5 million hectares of \r\nintegrated agricultural crop, livestock and forested area \r\npractices.\r\nOn the energy front, it is our intention to meet \r\nthe following ambitious objectives. First, we intend \r\nto ensure that the share of renewable resources in the \r\ntotal energy mix is 45 per cent. It should be noted that \r\nthe global average for such a share is just 13 per cent. \r\nFor the countries of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, it has been no greater \r\nthan 7 per cent. Secondly and thirdly on our energy \r\nagenda, we are committed to having a 66 per cent \r\nhydropower component and a 23 per cent renewable \r\nenergy component — wind, solar and biomass \r\n15-29247 3/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\npower — in our total electricity output. Fourthly, \r\nwe intend to increase by 10 per cent our electricity \r\nefficiency rate. Fifthly, we expect ethanol fuel derived \r\nfrom sugarcane biomass sources to provide 16 per cent \r\nof the total energy mix.\r\nIn short, the adaptation measures required to meet \r\nthe challenge of climate change will be accompanied \r\nby significant changes in land use, forestry practices, \r\nlivestock management, agricultural practices and \r\nenergy production and consumption patterns.\r\nWith regard to Goal 13 of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, our stance is such that we will \r\ncertainly contribute to improving the environment. \r\nBrazil is thus decisively helping to ensure that the world \r\nwill be in a position to implement the recommendations \r\nmade by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \r\nChange, which has established a limit of 2° Celsius as \r\nthe maximum temperature increase for this century.\r\nBrazil is one of the few developing countries \r\nto commit to an absolute target for the reduction of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions. We have one of the world’s \r\nlargest populations and gross domestic products, and \r\nour goals and targets are just as ambitious, if not more \r\nso, than those of developed countries. Our intended \r\nnational contribution takes into account mitigation \r\nand adaptation initiatives, as well as specific needs \r\nin the areas of financing, technology transfer and \r\ncapacity-building. It includes actions that increase the \r\nresilience of the environment and reduce the impact of \r\nthe risks associated with the negative effects of climate \r\nchange on the poor and more vulnerable sectors of the \r\npopulation. It puts special emphasis on gender issues \r\nand workers’ rights, as well as on Maroon, indigenous \r\nand other traditional communities. We also recognize \r\nthe importance of South-South cooperation in global \r\nefforts to combat climate change.\r\nWe must underscore that the social and inclusive \r\naspects of these efforts are essential to their success. \r\nSince 2003, social policies and cash transfer \r\nprogrammes have helped lift more than 36 million \r\nBrazilians out of extreme poverty. Last year, Brazil \r\nwas taken off the World Hunger Map. I should note that \r\nwe were able to achieve that status thanks to our zero-\r\nhunger programme, which has now evolved to become \r\none of the Sustainable Development Goals. Recently, \r\nowing to a policy aimed at increasing minimum wages, \r\nthe population’s purchasing power has grown. We have \r\nmade major social progress in areas such as housing \r\nprogrammes, access to basic education, public health \r\nservices and gender equality. We achieved those \r\nresults because we understand clearly that poverty is a \r\nmultidimensional problem.\r\nIn the transition to a low-carbon economy, we \r\nbelieve that everyone should be able to work in decent, \r\nfair conditions. Sustainable development requires that \r\nall of us commit to ensuring dignified conditions, \r\nthe creation of good jobs and opportunities and equal \r\naccess to education and health care. Even if we face \r\ndifficulties, Brazil will not cut back on its social \r\nprogress. That is the future we want and that we are \r\nall working to build. Our efforts to eradicate poverty \r\nand promote development must be collective and global \r\nin scope, hence the importance of the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. In my country, we have learned \r\none lesson very well, which is that the end of extreme \r\npoverty is only the start of a long journey.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil for her statement.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Constitutional President of the Republic \r\nof Ecuador.\r\nMr. Rafael Correa, Constitutional President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Correa (spoke in Spanish): Ecuador will \r\nmeet the 21 targets of the 8 Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). So far we have met 20 of them, some \r\nahead of time and to a higher standard than was \r\noriginally agreed on. The target we are still working on \r\nis the reduction of maternal mortality by at least 75 per \r\ncent. To date, we have achieved a reduction of 68 per \r\ncent, and we are implementing a specific strategy to \r\nmeet the target this year. Those results have been made \r\npossible by an unprecedented public investment, one \r\nof the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\nparticularly in the social sector.\r\nWhen my party came to power in 2007, we reaffirmed \r\nour commitment to the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), but not without questioning the way they were \r\nconceived. Eight years ago, in the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-second session (see A/62/PV.7), I warned about \r\nthe limitations of the underlying concept, since it was \r\nbased on minimum principles that did not grapple with \r\nthe profound social and economic asymmetries of our \r\nworld. We in Ecuador felt that subscribing exclusively \r\n4/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nto a set of minimums was very risky. The MDGs were \r\nsufficient to satisfy consciences, but limited in their \r\nability to generate genuine social change.\r\nOvercoming poverty is a moral imperative for \r\nhumankind because, for the first time in history, \r\nit results not from a scarcity of resources but from \r\nperverse and exclusionary systems. The best strategy \r\nfor reducing poverty is reducing social, economic, \r\nterritorial, environmental and cultural gaps. That \r\nis why we are very pleased that the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) stresses \r\nspecific targets aimed at achieving equitability in all \r\nthose aspects — social, economic, gender, ethnic and \r\nterritorial. All of that implies better income and wealth \r\ndistribution within and among societies, as well as the \r\nelimination of illegitimate ways of accumulating wealth, \r\nsuch as unfair inheritance laws, land speculation, \r\nunexploited capital and profits derived from damage to \r\nthe environment.\r\nDevelopment of public policies in a country that \r\nattempts radical change, such as Ecuador, cannot be \r\nlimited to minimum goals, because we would run the risk \r\nof adopting the view that  human life is simply a process \r\nof resistance, with the goal of extending people’s lives \r\nby a few hours. Therefore, we proposed shared goals \r\nconcerning not only minimum requirements for life but \r\nsocial maximums. A perspective based on minimum \r\ngoals would legitimize our current reality and would \r\nnot seek to bridge the gaps or the power relationships \r\namong people nor among societies. At best, minimum \r\ngoals should be seen as a start and a temporary \r\nobjective, and never as an ongoing modus operandi \r\nof public policy, since that puts the beneficiaries in a \r\nposition of inferiority to the rest.\r\nIn Ecuador, what we understand by development is \r\nachieving well-being for all in peace and in harmony \r\nwith nature and the continued preservation of human \r\ncultures. In that regard, we are particularly pleased that \r\nin the Sustainable Development Goals there is heavy \r\nemphasis on preserving our planet. Ecuador is the only \r\ncountry in the world that grants rights to nature. We \r\nare talking not just about addressing the environmental \r\ndegradation of the Earth, but about introducing \r\na new economic logic in which the creation of \r\nenvironmental value and environmental public goods, \r\nnot just commercial ones, is rewarded. We must create \r\nalternative forms of development rather than alternatives \r\nto development. We must build societies that work with \r\nthe market rather than being owned by the market. We \r\nmust proceed based on the realization that the dominant \r\nforms of production and consumption, which ignore the \r\nlimits of our ecosystem and seek endless growth and \r\naccumulation, are not viable. What we need is for the \r\nmajor countries to spend less time on diagnosing our \r\nunderdevelopment and more on questioning their own \r\nmodel of development. \r\nThat is why we are also very pleased to see that many \r\nof the new Goals — six altogether — are associated \r\nwith care for our planet, the only one we have. The well-\r\nbeing we promote also implies the expansion of the real \r\nfreedoms, opportunities and potentials of individuals. \r\nIn that regard, the immoral paradox that, on the one \r\nhand, we advocate for the free circulation of goods \r\nand capital in search of maximum profit, while, on the \r\nother hand, we punish the free circulation of persons in \r\nsearch of dignified work, becomes simply unacceptable \r\nand unsustainable from an ethical standpoint.\r\nTo the Government of Ecuador, there are no illegal \r\nhuman beings, and the United Nations should insist \r\non that point. The migration policies of the wealthy \r\nnations are frankly shameful. We need an agenda with \r\na focus on rights, one in which human mobility is \r\nnot criminalized and people are not deprived of their \r\nfundamental rights. The absence in the 2030 Agenda \r\nof a specific goal on the free movement of persons is \r\na regrettable omission. We need an agenda that lends \r\nits ear to the words of the young poet Warsan Shire: no \r\none puts their children in a boat unless water is safer \r\nthan land.\r\nWe place our hopes, dear friends of the whole \r\nworld, in a development agenda in which the sense of \r\nhumanity prevails over the rule of capital. Otherwise, \r\nwe will simply continue to affirm goals and targets \r\nwhen what we need is to renew our entire compact as a \r\ncivilization.\r\nThe President: I thank the Constitutional President \r\nof the Republic of Ecuador for his statement.\r\nMr. Rafael Correa, Constitutional President of \r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina.\r\nMr. Dragan Čović, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\n15-29247 5/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nMr. Čović (spoke in Bosnian; English text provided \r\nby the delegation): It is a great honour for me to address \r\nthis historic Summit, which is devoted to issues that are \r\ncrucial for both the present moment and the future of \r\nall the inhabitants of our planet. United by our strong \r\nbelief in the values enshrined in the Organization’s \r\nfounding Charter, we have committed ourselves to \r\ngiving full life and new meaning to the vision of a just \r\nand sustainable world free from poverty, fear and all \r\nforms of oppression.\r\nIn our lifetime, we have witnessed achievements \r\nbeyond anything our ancestors could have imagined. \r\nExtraordinary technological progress has propelled \r\nour economies and our societies. Progress in reducing \r\nhunger has been slow and uneven, but the results to date \r\ngive us reason to hope that the scourge of hunger can be \r\neliminated in our lifetime. Average life expectancy has \r\nmore than doubled over the past century, and we can \r\nproudly say that more children than ever are exactly \r\nwhere they belong — in classrooms. Yet, we should \r\nbe seriously troubled that we have inflicted so much \r\ndamage on both the planet and ourselves during the \r\npast decades.\r\nThe most serious threats facing our world today \r\nare unfortunately all too well known: poverty, \r\nunemployment, natural disasters, violence and \r\nterrorism. Day after day, new reports of unspeakable \r\nhuman suffering from a number of conflict areas, \r\nincluding an immense refugee crisis, demand our \r\nurgent and meaningful response. A rapid and united \r\neffort is required to address all those threats, along with \r\nstronger determination to redress the consequences of \r\nour past mistakes and wrongdoings. We should build \r\nour approach on the positive experiences and lessons \r\nlearned, in order to achieve the comprehensive and \r\nambitious 2030 Agenda. for Sustainable Developmebnt \r\n(resolution 70/1).\r\nThe strongest message we should send at this \r\nhistorical moment is our renewed sense of responsibility \r\nand our resolve to act together with all stakeholders. \r\nSuch an inclusive Agenda is a guarantee that no one will \r\nbe left behind. To that end, an appropriate balance must \r\nbe struck across the economic, social and environmental \r\nspheres. Effective and integrated solutions are possible \r\nonly through a systems-based approach across all three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development. We see no way \r\nto achieve sustainable development in the true sense \r\nof the words except through a positive and constant \r\nchange.\r\nThe world 15 years from now can and should be \r\na place of universal respect for human rights. We \r\nmust continue working to advance the role of women \r\nand their full engagement in the development of our \r\nsocieties, especially in decision-making processes. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina remains committed to the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights and respect \r\nfor the fundamental freedoms of all, without distinction, \r\nas reflected in the Summit outcome document.\r\nThe past five years have demonstrated to the people \r\nof my country the true meaning of climate change, \r\nwhich is not only and exclusively about different \r\nweather conditions. In reality, it is more about not \r\nproducing any food during dry years and people being \r\nforced to leave their homes during f loods. It is about \r\nthe scarcity of clean, safe, potable water, a commodity \r\nand luxury in times of droughts and f loods.\r\nThat is why, along with millions of people around \r\nthe world, we are putting our faith in the forthcoming \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held in Paris in December. We must believe that the \r\noutcome of that session will deliver the progress we so \r\nurgently need. Therefore, we call upon the parties to the \r\nConvention to redouble their efforts to reach a legally \r\nbinding and universal climate change agreement.\r\nThere is without a doubt a strong relationship \r\nlinking peace, stability and sustainable development. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina will continue to work with \r\nour neighbours and international partners, in an \r\natmosphere of mutual respect and tolerance, to take \r\nproactive, strategic steps to strengthen peace, stability \r\nand prosperity in our region. In that regard, I can \r\nassure the Assembly of my country’s strong support \r\nfor the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Our own \r\ndedication to fostering sustainable, effective and steady \r\neconomic growth and, through functional democratic \r\ninstitutions, to build a just social environment is \r\nendorsed in the Bosnia and Herzegovina 2015-2018 \r\nreform agenda that we recently adopted.\r\nEven the best strategies sometimes fail to produce \r\nthe desired outcome if not supported by equally credible \r\nmeans of implementation. Investment in educational, \r\ninstitutional, technological and human capacities is \r\ntherefore of paramount importance for many developing \r\ncountries, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. \r\nDeveloping, implementing and monitoring our national \r\nstrategies must include resources and efforts from all \r\n6/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nstakeholders - parliamentarians, academia, civil society \r\nand the private sector.\r\nAlmost all the troubles we face today recognize \r\nno borders. Neither should solidarity in our world. As \r\nwe see it, solidarity should combine responsibility and \r\nrespect for national ownership of development, on the \r\none hand, and readiness to provide assistance, on the \r\nother.\r\nAn enhanced global partnership for sustainable \r\ndevelopment must be a genuine global platform for the \r\nexchange of best practices in finance, trade, technology \r\nand capacity-building. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, \r\nin its comprehensiveness, has provided us with a strong \r\nfoundation for revitalization and for the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As \r\na first step, we should undoubtedly start with what is \r\ntoday openly recognized as our unfinished business: \r\nthe full realization of all the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. We should keep our promises. \r\nToday, our people not only look up to us. They \r\nbelieve that the world can still change for the better. \r\nEquality, prosperity, dignity and security for every \r\nhuman being are what future generations need from us, \r\nand I am convinced that we can — and must — deliver \r\nthem.\r\nThe President: I thank the Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for his statement.\r\nMr. Dragan Čović, Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nPresident Maduro Moros (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nare witnessing the signs of a new era for humankind. \r\nThe United Nations system is marking its seventieth \r\nanniversary since it began its effort to heal the deep \r\nwounds of the most destructive war that humankind has \r\never known. The Second World War left its physical \r\ntraces on millions of women and men, as well as deep \r\nmoral traces — the marks of the struggle against \r\nfascism and Nazism and their various manifestations of \r\ncontempt for the human essence and the diverse forms \r\nof human culture and civilization. Seventy years ago, \r\nhumankind began to build a system to come together \r\nand, as Pope Francis said just days ago from this very \r\nrostrum (see A/70/PV.3), to map a path towards the \r\nconstruction of our common home, the common home \r\nof humankind.\r\nWe are approaching the end of this Summit, \r\nconvened to set the goals shared by our countries, \r\npeoples and Governments for social development, \r\na Summit whose core purpose is to review the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and define the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. I would like to \r\ncongratulate all the delegations on their work of many \r\nmonths evaluating the Goals for 2000 to 2015, and to \r\nacknowledge their success in integrating proposals from \r\nvarious countries and Governments with their various \r\nvisions to arrive at what we have just adopted, the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nIn Venezuela’s view, the 2030 Agenda is one for \r\nthe development of a world of equals and is designed \r\nto eradicate the inequalities that are the mother and \r\nthe source of all misery and poverty, of discardable \r\ncultures, as Pope Francis said in his visit to Cuba and \r\nthe United States. Poverty is the child of the inequality \r\nimposed by systems of domination that for centuries \r\nenveloped our planet, tore Africa apart and imposed \r\ncolonialism and slavery. Inequality is the child of all \r\nthe forms of domination, exclusion and exploitation \r\nthat devastated the aboriginal and primeval cultures \r\nthat, to our great pride, are represented in our America \r\ntoday by our brother Evo Morales Ayma.\r\nInequality is the mother of all misery and poverty. \r\nIf we wish to set lofty goals, as we are doing, and if we \r\nwish to meet the lofty goals we have set ourselves — the \r\n17 Goals and 169 targets defined by our delegations and \r\nnow established bu us, aimed at making progress on \r\nsuch major issues as overcoming poverty, establishing \r\ninclusive, free and high-quality public education, \r\nuniversal health care, the right to housing and a clean \r\nenvironment, that is, respect for Mother Earth — if we \r\nwish to advance the cause of the lofty Goals and targets \r\nwe have set, there can be no doubt that the world must \r\nplan on building different economic and social models \r\nand a different model for power relationships over the \r\nnext 15 years.\r\nThere is no other way. That is what we say \r\nin Venezuela, where over the past 15 years of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals we have lived through \r\none of the most beautiful, profound and significant \r\nprocesses in our history, in which, together with our \r\n15-29247 7/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nbrothers in Latin America and the Caribbean, we \r\nhave undergone an awakening, a reinvigoration of the \r\nstruggle fought in the past by the poor, the forgotten and \r\nthe wretched of the Earth. In the years between 2000 \r\nand 2015, Venezuela accomplished an economic, social \r\nand political revolution, the Bolivarian revolution, \r\ninspired by the original, fundamental cause of our \r\nliberator Simón Bolívar and designed, directed and led \r\nby our unforgettable leader, Hugo Chávez Frías.\r\nThe first step was regaining our political \r\nindependence, the capacity to make decisions about \r\nour national affairs and plan how to invest our national \r\nwealth. The second was recovering our natural resources, \r\nparticularly the wealth generated by Venezuelan oil, \r\nthrough the nationalization and sovereign management \r\nof the basic resources produced on our land — in this \r\ncase, oil. The third step was constitutionally reinstating \r\nour people’s fundamental rights, which for decades had \r\nbeen denied them by the domestic systems of oppression \r\nthat corresponded to the systems of oppression of world \r\nPowers outside our country.\r\nThat path taken by our people, we humbly say \r\ntoday at this Summit, a path that marked a profound \r\nand genuine revolution, has put us in a position to \r\nbegin to construct and put into practice a system of \r\nredistribution of wealth and to re-establish the elements \r\nof economic and social equality and equal access to \r\nwealth. From the very beginning of the Bolivarian \r\nrevolution, our leader Hugo Chávez said that if we \r\nwished to overcome poverty, we must give power to the \r\npoor and power to the people. And when we speak of \r\npower, we mean national power first of all. When we \r\nspeak of power, we mean power for the citizens and \r\nthe humble: social, economic and civic power. We mean \r\nempowering the people so that they themselves can take \r\ncharge of building their own happiness and overcoming \r\ntheir own situation.\r\nToday, Venezuela can actually present a satisfactory \r\nrecord — a positive balance sheet — to the General \r\nAssembly. Today, Venezuela can say that the immense \r\nwealth of our country has been distributed through our \r\ninvestment in education, housing, health care, the right \r\nto food and the right to life. \r\nWe have managed to reverse the exclusionary trends \r\nof capitalist throwaway culture, to paraphrase Pope \r\nFrancis. Whereas in the past we invested barely 33 per \r\ncent of the national income or national wealth, today \r\nVenezuela invests 62 per cent of its national wealth in \r\nthe development of our people, in promoting equality \r\nand reducing poverty and extreme poverty, with the \r\nresulting indices showing significant improvements \r\nin education, health care, employment and labour \r\nremuneration. \r\nWe have managed to reverse the trends towards \r\nderegulating labour conditions for workers and \r\ncreating precarious employment that exploits workers, \r\nespecially the youngest workers. The right to stable and \r\ndecent work, as proclaimed in various United Nations \r\nsystem instruments, or what we call the right to fair \r\nand egalitarian work, is a fundamental right if we want \r\nthe goal to be our peoples’ proactively overcoming their \r\ndifficulties and lifting themselves out of poverty and \r\nextreme poverty.\r\nWe have fully and wholeheartedly adopted the \r\n17 Goals proposed for the years 2015 to 2030. The 17 \r\nGoals are designed to eradicate poverty, put an end \r\nto hunger, ensure health care, guarantee a quality \r\neducation, attain gender equality, guarantee the \r\navailability and sustainable management of water, \r\nand ensure access to energy on a fair basis, as we are \r\ncurrently doing through the special inclusive projects \r\nbased on solidarity and brotherhood under the auspices \r\nof Petrocaribe. Petrocaribe is sponsoring joint projects \r\nto provide 18 Caribbean States with genuine access to \r\nenergy, an undertaking that I deem worthy of study by \r\nthe committees that will follow up on the Agenda.\r\nThe Agenda is a set of 17 Goals designed to foster \r\nequitable economic growth and the transformation of \r\nan economic model, as provided for in Goal 8. Without \r\nthe transformation of the unfair, single-vision economic \r\nmodel that attempts to impose political and social \r\nconditions that are unacceptable for our peoples — a \r\nmodel imposed by the International Monetary Fund and \r\nthe World Bank on our countries — it will be impossible \r\nto work towards and attain the desired, lofty, necessary \r\nand just Goals for 2015-2030. Only after a profound \r\ntransformation of the economic system and a total and \r\nabsolute change of the system imposed by the one-track, \r\nneoliberal thinking that the International Monetary \r\nFund and the World Bank espouse will the Goals and \r\ntargets for poverty eradication and universal social \r\nhappiness proposed today be economically viable and \r\nsustainable.\r\nThe year 2030 is a target date that must bind us all. \r\nAfter reviewing the history of the past 15 years, and of \r\nthe 70 years of the United Nations system, and the great \r\nchallenges and serious problems faced by humankind \r\nduring those years, we can be sure that the next 15 years \r\n8/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nwill bring great challenges as we seek to consolidate \r\nworld peace, strengthen new, fair, equitable, equality-\r\nbased, inclusive — and non-exclusionary — economic \r\nrelations and construct social and technological models \r\nthat will allow our peoples to gain access to rights that \r\ntoday are denied to over 1.2 billion poor people. These \r\nare important topics that the United Nations will have \r\nto address. While it is true that for the attainment of \r\nthese social goals a new economic model becomes \r\nnecessary and new ways of creating equality must be \r\nconsidered, it is also true — or so we believe in the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela — that a system of \r\nguarantees to safeguard peace and sovereignty for our \r\npeoples is also necessary.\r\nIt is worth taking a look at the tragedies being \r\nendured today by the Arab peoples and our brothers \r\nand sisters in Africa and Asia, as well as at the most \r\ntragic and painful mass migration in the last 70 years \r\nthat is playing out in the Mediterranean and European \r\ncountries. Why is there such mass migration if it is not \r\na f light from misery and pain? There is only one cause: \r\nunfair wars of aggression that are aimed at conquering \r\nentire nations. A review of the 15 years in which the \r\nMillennium Development Goals have been in place \r\nraises the question, why is that region of the world \r\nliving a horror movie? It seems that millions of Muslim \r\nArab brothers and sisters in the Middle East are looking \r\nfor a shred of peace, a beacon of hope. The specific \r\nconcrete cause that has had a negative impact on these \r\nfraternal peoples of Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria \r\nis none other than unfair imperialist wars, the attempt \r\nto control the world by a single hegemonic Power that \r\nwants to dominate people.\r\nWe must put an end to unfair systems and imperialist \r\nwars so that there can be truly humane conditions \r\nfor moving forward to attain the lofty objectives that \r\nhumankind has been able to identify and build during \r\nthe 70 years of existence of the United Nations system. \r\nAs Pope Francis said to a full house, and was greeted \r\nby heartfelt applause by the representatives of all \r\ncultures and peoples, if we wish to have a shared house \r\nby 2030 — and we in Venezuela have that dream and \r\nwill struggle indefatigably to make it come true — we \r\nneed to have a shared house without imperialist wars, \r\nwithout wars of destruction, without racism, without \r\nxenophobia, without contempt and without inequality. \r\nWe must think about a common cause uniting peoples \r\nwhose relations are based on respect for international \r\nlaw and peoples who are committed to the 2030 Agenda \r\nbecause they see it as a great human agenda for building \r\npeace, happiness and universal justice.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela expresses its \r\nhappiness with, and its intention to abide by, the 2030 \r\nAgenda.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela for his statement.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Serbia.\r\nMr. Tomislav Nikolić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Nikolić (spoke in Serbian; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): Here at the Headquarters \r\nof the United Nations, during this Summit, we have \r\nadopted an ambitious transformational agenda, the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), \r\nwith Goals and targets intended to substantively change \r\nour civilization for the better during the next 15 years. \r\nA difficult and unprecedented task lies ahead of us: \r\neradicating poverty — particularly  extreme poverty —\r\nby 2030 and laying the foundations for maintaining the \r\nsustainable development of our planet for the benefit of \r\nfuture generations.\r\nThe positive results of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals — such as the reduction by half of the percentage \r\nof people living in extreme poverty, which we achieved \r\nahead of time — led us to believe that the transformation \r\nof our world is possible. In the twenty-first century, we \r\nlive an era of tremendous technological achievements, \r\nwhich for the first time in human history provide a \r\nrealistic opportunity for not simply each country but \r\neach individual to achieve sustainable development. No \r\none should be left behind or forgotten.\r\nFor more than two years, our diplomats and our \r\ncivil societies, private business sectors and academia \r\nnegotiated a new set of proposals formulated in the \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030. \r\nThey are comprehensive and touch upon almost all \r\nelements of economic, social and environmental \r\ndevelopment. These universal Goals apply to all \r\ncountries, rich and poor, with particular concern for the \r\nsizable part of the population living in extreme poverty \r\non as little as $1.25 a day.\r\n15-29247 9/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nOur generation has a moral obligation to create \r\nin today’s world conditions in which no one goes \r\nhungry, gender equality prevails and women and girls \r\nare empowered. We must end the harmful effects of \r\nthe warming of our planet, which is threatened by \r\nlarge-scale climate change. All too often an alarm bell \r\nrings, and all too often we experience natural disasters, \r\ndroughts and f loods, such as those that, with tragic \r\nconsequences, struck my country and the region hard \r\na year ago.\r\nIt was not easy to reach consensus on the new global \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Yet we all \r\nshare this planet of ours. Not only do we have no other \r\nhome to go to, but we have the duty to do everything we \r\ncan to preserve it and to ensure sustainable development, \r\nincluding for the most vulnerable among us. \r\nOf course, the key question is how to effectively \r\nimplement such an ambitious Agenda. In July, at \r\nthe third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, we reached consensus on sustainable \r\ndevelopment financing modalities through the adoption \r\nof the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We agreed on the \r\nneed to mobilize all financial resources — public, private, \r\ndomestic, international and miscellaneous. We agreed \r\nto fulfil the obligation to commit 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income to official development assistance, and \r\n0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of that amount to the least \r\ndeveloped countries. Technology transfer, indebtedness \r\nand reaching trade agreements were also high on the \r\nConference agenda. We reaffirmed the principle that \r\nevery country has the primary responsibility for its \r\nown development and that it must create conditions \r\nfor progress and prosperity through good governance \r\nand the rule of law, combating corruption and halting \r\nillegal financial f lows.\r\nMr. Rafael Correa (Ecuador), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nSerbia actively participated in the formulation of \r\nthe global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nThe negotiations in the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals, of which my country \r\nwas a member, were kick-started when a Serbian was \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nseventh session. Serbia also took part in the work \r\nof the Intergovernmental Committee of Experts on \r\nSustainable Development Financing.\r\nAs a middle-income, landlocked country in \r\ntransition, Serbia still shoulders the heavy burden \r\nof caring for a large number of refugees and persons \r\ndisplaced in and after the conflicts in our region, while \r\ncoping with the development problems that many other \r\ncountries face. The dramatic and uncontrolled influx \r\nof migrants — who in tens of thousands transit Serbia \r\nin search of shelter and a better life and who wait for \r\ndays to cross the border into the European Union — is \r\na challenge that we must all address together if we are \r\nto achieve a solution.\r\nSerbia firmly believes that development is not \r\npossible without peace and stability. We strongly \r\nsupport Goal 16, on peaceful and inclusive societies, \r\nand in that context we believe in investing continued \r\nefforts in developing good neighbourly relations in the \r\nregion. That is because the process of reconciliation \r\nand cooperation has no alternative.\r\nAs in other countries of the region, the unemployment \r\nrate in Serbia continues to be high, especially for young \r\npeople, and the rate of economic growth is low. As in \r\nmany other countries, the economic recession has \r\nspiralled upward since the onset of the global financial \r\ncrisis. In cooperation with the International Monetary \r\nFund and with its support, we have made considerable \r\nefforts towards fiscal consolidation. With painful cuts \r\nacross the board, we have managed to reduce Serbia’s \r\nfiscal deficit from 7 per cent to its current level of \r\napproximately 3 per cent. We expect that this year the \r\ngross national product will begin to grow.\r\nAs a European Union candidate country, Serbia has \r\nharmonized its legislative system with the European \r\nUnion’s body of law and has taken important steps to \r\nreform its economy, rebuild its infrastructure, tap into \r\nsustainable energy resources and tackle environmental \r\nproblems. We fully understand that success in attaining \r\nsustainable development is not possible without all-\r\nround regional cooperation. We shall therefore hold \r\nconsultations in Belgrade later this year to discuss \r\nwith our regional partners how to work together in \r\nimplementing the Agenda.\r\nWe have embarked upon an ambitious and \r\nunprecedented project. Failure must not, and cannot, \r\nbe an option. Our generation has a historic opportunity \r\nto set our civilization on the course towards achieving \r\nsustainable development, prosperity and peace, and I \r\ntrust that that opportunity will not be ignored.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Serbia for his statement.\r\n10/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nMr. Tomislav Nikolić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Rahmon (spoke in Tajik; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): This year is the final \r\nyear for the implementation of the 2015 Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). The lessons learned \r\nduring their implementation were used as a basis for \r\nthe post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda. The \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals played an important role in the process and, over \r\nthe past two years, managed to identify and agree on 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), to be achieved \r\nby 2030.\r\nWe will soon begin to implement the new 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nWe will do so against the background and increasing \r\nimpact of such global threats and challenges as \r\ninternational terrorism and extremism, illicit drug \r\ntrafficking, transnational organized crime, armed \r\nconflicts and financial, economic, food and energy \r\ncrises, together with the degradation of natural \r\nresources and climate change, natural and human-\r\ncaused disasters and infectious diseases, all of which \r\nseriously undermine security and stability in the \r\nworld and can slow the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn that regard, we believe that the international \r\ncommunity should bolster its efforts to create a global \r\nenvironment that is conducive to the implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. The new Agenda \r\nis unique because it lays down the specific Goals and \r\ntargets for sustainable development in its three key \r\ndimensions — economic, social and environmental — in \r\na balanced and integrated manner. We are convinced \r\nthat the Sustainable Development Goals aimed at \r\naddressing poverty eradication, ensuring food security, \r\nimproving health care and education, ensuring the \r\nsustainable use of water resources, improving access \r\nto cost-effective and reliable energy sources, the \r\nestablishment of advanced infrastructure, the adoption \r\nof urgent measures to combat climate change and its \r\nimpact, the reduction of inequality among countries and \r\nthe achievement of gender equality on a global scale are \r\na logical continuation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.\r\nAs a pilot country for the implementation of the \r\nMDGs, Tajikistan attaches great importance to the \r\nprocess of improving the previous MDG agenda and \r\nrealizing the new post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThe Republic of Tajikistan participated actively in \r\ndeveloping and coordinating the global development \r\nagenda beyond 2015 by taking an active part in and \r\ncontributing to the global dialogue. Our Government \r\nheld a number of national consultations aimed at \r\nreflecting the aspirations of a wide spectrum of the \r\npopulation concerning the future they want. The \r\nGovernment of Tajikistan is currently developing \r\nits new national development strategy 2030 and the \r\nmid-term development programme for the period \r\n2016-2020, which outline the priority areas for the \r\ncountry’s sustainable development and will take into \r\naccount, where possible, the targets identified by the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In that regard, the \r\nUnited Nations country programme action plan for \r\nTajikistan for 2016-2020 will be particularly useful.\r\nThe primary objective of both the programme \r\nand the strategy being developed is to improve the \r\nwell-being of the country’s population through \r\nsustainable social and economic development. In \r\norder to successfully address the set of complex \r\nsocial, economic and environmental issues within the \r\nframework of the country’s 2030 national development \r\nstrategy, we have identified the importance of setting \r\nstrategic goals —, such as ensuring energy security, \r\nbreaking communication deadlocks and ensuring food \r\nsecurity — without which the implementation of the \r\nSDGs would be rather difficult. \r\nTo achieve those goals, we need to implement a \r\nnumber of projects at the national, regional and global \r\nlevels. The priority areas are more efficient use of \r\nnatural resources and human capital, the diversification \r\nof the national economy to enhance its competitiveness, \r\nthe development of the country’s institutions, the \r\nstrengthening of the middle class and the achievement \r\nof equal levels of development in all regions of the \r\ncountry.\r\nIn order to successfully implement those targets, \r\nit is essential to mobilize the necessary resources. \r\nThat remains a challenge because of the ever-changing \r\ndynamics of international relations and the emerging \r\ncrises in various regions of the world. In that context, \r\n15-29247 11/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nincreases in official development assistance, which \r\nforms an important component of financing for \r\ndevelopment, remains critical. Under the current \r\ncircumstances, it is crucial to facilitate international \r\ntrade and investment, which are the main engines of \r\nproductive growth, and to encourage and promote the \r\ntransfer of innovative and environmentally friendly \r\ntechnologies.\r\nIt is obvious that the path towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment is not going to be easy or smooth. For \r\nthat reason, it is important that we show determination \r\nand lend a hand to those countries facing the most \r\ndifficulties. It should be remembered that a number \r\nof countries will start implementing the new Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development in less than favourable \r\nconditions. There is a need to support countries in \r\nspecific situations, in particular the countries with \r\nmountainous and inaccessible terrain and landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that \r\nTajikistan will continue to actively cooperate with \r\nthe international community, the United Nations \r\ninstitutions and programmes and partner countries and \r\norganizations interested in successfully implementing \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Tajikistan for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Bulgaria.\r\nMr. Rosen Plevneliev, President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Plevneliev: We have just adopted a new \r\ndevelopment agenda. The post-2015 process is a unique \r\nglobal effort aimed at ending poverty and achieving \r\nsustainable development for all, while protecting the \r\nplanet and its resources. The United Nations and its \r\nMember States representatives of civil society and \r\nthe private sector and academia all participated in the \r\ndeliberation process.\r\nBulgaria welcomes the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nThis forward-looking and ambitious new Agenda \r\nintegrates the three pillars of sustainable development, \r\nthus outlining the links between poverty eradication, \r\nsustainable economic development and peaceful and \r\nstable societies. It is an impressive and transformative \r\nAgenda in many ways. For the first time in history, a \r\ndocument of global scale places special emphasis on \r\nthe individual, leaving no one behind. The Agenda \r\nis people-centred and based on the principles of \r\nuniversality, inclusiveness and shared responsibilities.\r\nDuring the intergovernmental negotiations, Bulgaria \r\nstrongly advocated, in its national capacity and as part \r\nof the European Union, for the elaboration of a human \r\nrights-based agenda. Every effort has been made to \r\neliminate all forms of inequality and discrimination. \r\nAs one of the co-chairs of the Group of Friends of \r\nChildren and Sustainable Development Goals, Bulgaria \r\nworked for the integration of children’s human rights \r\nin all aspects of development policies, placing children \r\nat the heart of the Agenda. For the first time, children \r\nand youth were considered active participants in all \r\nprocesses that affect their lives.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals that we have \r\nagreed on are ambitious and need bold and determined \r\nactions to be fully implemented. Bulgaria will make \r\nevery effort to implement the new Agenda and \r\nachieve its Goals of eradicating poverty, eliminating \r\ninequalities and fostering a peaceful, just and inclusive \r\nsociety based on the rule of law. Our country will also \r\ncontinue to do its best to help more vulnerable nations \r\nachieve those ambitious Goals.\r\nThe way in which the Agenda was adopted \r\nis indicative of the strong political will for its \r\nimplementation. Balance was achieved between the \r\ncommitments contained in the document and the means \r\nfor their implementation. However, robust national \r\nand international accountability should be sought \r\nthrough the participation of all stakeholders, including \r\nGovernments, civil society, the private sector and \r\nacademia.\r\nThe adoption of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nrepresents a success for the international community. \r\nThe implementation of the new Agenda should be \r\nguided by the principles of accountability, transparency \r\nand inclusiveness. The monitoring and review of its \r\nimplementation should be based on a well-defined set of \r\nglobal indicators, as well as on the timely collection of \r\ndisaggregated data. We welcome the ongoing work on \r\nthe part of the United Nations Statistical Commission \r\nin that regard.\r\n12/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nThe decisions that we make today will affect all \r\nof us over the next 15 years. The Agenda is a joint and \r\nconsensual effort and is, at this point, the only viable \r\nsolution that we have for dealing with the challenges we \r\nface. And we need to deliver.\r\nBulgaria believes the focus should now be on the \r\nimplementation of the new Agenda Goals, and we are \r\nfully committed to contribute to their success.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Bulgaria for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Rosen Plevneliev, President of the Republic of \r\nBulgaria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of South Africa.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Zuma: Seventy years ago, at the birth \r\nof the United Nations, the drafters of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations pledged in the Preamble “To promote \r\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom”. The objective was to save future generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war through the eradication of \r\npoverty and the promotion of an improved quality of \r\nlife for all the peoples of the world, especially the poor.\r\nThe world was very different then from what it is \r\ntoday. Many members of the current Group of 77 and \r\nChina were in fact not free then and were living under \r\nforeign and colonial occupation. In the past 70 years, \r\nthe world has seen many developments, including \r\ndecolonization and the ushering in of freedom and self-\r\ndetermination, and the establishment of new, free and \r\nindependent nations.\r\nHowever, despite such progress, the world has still \r\nnot adequately addressed underdevelopment, inequality, \r\nincreasing poverty and economic exclusion. Fifteen \r\nyears ago, the Millennium Declaration (resolution \r\n55/2) was adopted. The Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) became a clarion call for directing and \r\npromoting global socioeconomic development and for \r\nlifting millions of people out of poverty throughout the \r\nworld. The Secretary-General’s most recent report on \r\nthe MDGs, The Millennium Development Goals Report \r\n2015, indicates that the number of people living in \r\nextreme poverty has declined significantly. Progress \r\nhas been recorded in reaching some of the MDGs.\r\nIn my own country, South Africa, there has been a \r\nhuge increase in a number of areas, such as education, \r\nhealth and gender equality. Primary-school enrolment, \r\nincluding the participation of girls, has increased. \r\nChild and maternal mortality rates have shown a \r\ndecline. Targeted interventions in fighting diseases, \r\nsuch as human-immunodeficiency virus infections and \r\nacquired immune deficiency syndrome, have also saved \r\nthousands of lives.\r\nThe achievement of the MDGs has been uneven \r\nacross geographical regions, with regions such as Africa \r\nlagging behind, owing to historical reasons based on \r\nunderdevelopment. That is the context in which we have \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) on this historic seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Goals and targets in the new Agenda cover \r\nall three dimensions of sustainable development and \r\nenable us to continue seamlessly from the MDGs. \r\nThey range from ending poverty, ensuring healthy \r\nlives, ensuring inclusive and equitable high-quality \r\neducation, achieving gender equality and empowering \r\nall women and girls to conserving and sustainably using \r\nthe oceans and addressing climate change. South Africa \r\nendorses this transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda without any reservations.\r\nThe triple challenges of poverty, unemployment \r\nand inequality, which the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment seeks to address, are the primary focus \r\nof the South African Government and people. The \r\nSustainable Development Goals are also in line with \r\nSouth Africa’s national development plan as well as \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063. More important, \r\nthe outcome document of the post-2015 development \r\nnegotiations at the United Nations represents a victory \r\nfor developing countries, as it affirms that the 2030 \r\nAgenda should build on the unfinished business of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nIn addition, while the 2030 Agenda is universal in \r\nthat the Goals apply to both developed and developing \r\ncountries, there is a clear recognition of the principle of \r\ncommon but differentiated responsibilities. That takes \r\ninto account the different national realities, capacities \r\nand levels of development and also respects national \r\npolicies and priorities.\r\nThe negotiations on the 2030 Agenda took place \r\nagainst the backdrop of the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda, recently concluded at the third International \r\n15-29247 13/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nConference on Financing for Development, as well \r\nas the ongoing negotiations on the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. While \r\nthe new Agenda stands on its own, it will draw on the \r\nsupport of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the \r\noutcome of the negotiations at the Conference of the \r\nParties to the  Climate Change Convention, as well as \r\non the outcomes of other multilateral meetings, both \r\nnow and in the future, to achieve its objectives.\r\nWe are also pleased that the global 2030 Agenda \r\nincludes a specific Goal on achieving gender equality \r\nand empowering all women and girls. All 17 of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, including those on \r\npoverty eradication, education, health, job creation and \r\ninequality, include specific references to the challenges \r\nthat confront women, youth, people with disabilities \r\nand other vulnerable sectors of our society. We are also \r\nparticularly pleased that the 2030 Agenda includes a \r\nstand-alone Goal on the means of implementation, \r\nwhich seeks to ensure that adequate attention is placed \r\non the achievement of the substantive Goals.\r\nEvents in the recent past have demonstrated that \r\nthe countries of the developed North cannot insulate \r\nthemselves from the challenges facing countries of \r\nthe developing South. In that regard, we welcome the \r\ncommitment to the global partnership in order to ensure \r\nthe implementation of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. We call on development partners to not only \r\nmeet their current commitments, but also to enhance \r\ntheir official development assistance (ODA) with \r\nbinding timetables, given the fact that ODA remains \r\nthe main source of development assistance for many \r\ndeveloping countries. We also reiterate that climate \r\nfinancing is new and additional to ODA and cannot be \r\ncounted as ODA, nor should it be mixed with traditional \r\ndevelopment financing.\r\nSignificant work and consultation has gone into \r\nnegotiating the 2030 Agenda. We now have a document \r\nthat we can confidently say reflects our global \r\ndevelopment aspirations while building on the progress \r\nmade in the past 15 years. The full implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda will move the world forward towards \r\nthe realization of the vision of social progress found in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and better standards \r\nof life in larger freedom, as pledged at the founding of \r\nthe United Nations 70 years ago.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of South Africa for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan.\r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Nazarbayev (spoke in Russian): Kazakhstan \r\nhas worked diligently to fulfil the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Today, we can talk about what we \r\nhave accomplished. \r\nFirst of all, we have strengthened the foundations \r\nof governance and created the conditions for the \r\ndevelopment of civil society. Secondly, Kazakhstan’s \r\ngross domestic product has grown 19-fold, and our \r\nannual per capita income has reached $13,000. Thirdly, \r\nthe life expectancy of the people of the country now \r\nexceeds 70 years. The level of poverty has been reduced \r\n11-fold — from 34 to 3 per cent. The level of infant and \r\nmaternal mortality has also been reduced by 65 per cent. \r\nWe have made significant progress in the fight against \r\ndiseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \r\nFourthly, Kazakhstan has cut its greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and focused on maintaining the biodiversity \r\nof our planet. It has also approved a national plan for \r\nthe transition to a green economy.\r\nThe disappearance of the Aral Sea represents a \r\nthreat not only to our region, but to the world as a whole. \r\nAs a result of the drying up of that Sea, the wind picks \r\nup as much as 75 million tons of dust and poisonous \r\ndeposits per annum, which have been detected in \r\nEurope and Antarctica. With the support of the World \r\nBank, we have been able to restore the northern part of \r\nthe Aral Sea. We are also working, together with the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community, to \r\nclean up the zone of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear \r\ntest site. The countries of Central Asia are awaiting \r\nhelp in the fight against the ecological problems in the \r\nregion.\r\nKazakhstan supports the comprehensive new \r\ndocument for the development of our planet, the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which has \r\njust been adopted (resolution 70/1). The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, as set out in the new Agenda, \r\nrepresent a turning point for the countries and peoples \r\nof the world. The outcome document of this Summit \r\n14/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nwill become a truly global road map for development \r\nand prosperity on Earth.\r\nThe main responsibility for the implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals lies with national \r\nGovernments. The Goals and targets of the new \r\nAgenda fully coincide with the priorities and objectives \r\nthat Kazakhstan has established for the future. Our \r\nresponse to those modern challenges, which we have \r\nentitled the Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, will be adopted \r\nin the country. Its aim is to make Kazakhstan one of \r\nthe 30 most developed countries in the world. We are \r\ncarrying out a national plan, including five institutional \r\nreforms aimed at modernizing the State apparatus, \r\nimproving the work of civil and legal institutions, \r\nfurther industrializing our economy and fostering an \r\nopen society.\r\nThe resurrection and modernization of the Silk \r\nRoad economy is important for the countries of Eurasia \r\nand will benefit many countries by maintaining transit \r\nfrom the Asia-Pacific region to Europe. Kazakhstan is \r\nworking on its infrastructure by building railways and \r\nroads that will unite the Pacific with Europe and the \r\nMiddle East across Kazakhstan. Our country, which \r\nhas no access to the sea, has become a transit territory \r\nand has thus gained access.  The time has come for us \r\nto unite around the idea of a greater Eurasia that will \r\nunite into a single integrational twenty-first century \r\nproject — the Eurasian Economic Union, the economic \r\narea of the Silk Road and the European Union. \r\nA gap is growing in the world between the rich and \r\nthe poor. However, a negative trend is being exacerbated \r\nby conflicts in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. The \r\ncurrent migration crisis is the result not only of walls, \r\nbut also of imbalances in development. In the twenty-\r\nfirst century, successful States will be identified not \r\nby their arsenals of weapons, but by their abilities to \r\ndevelop cutting-edge ideas and to lead people towards \r\nthem.\r\nAccording to the Stockholm International Peace \r\nResearch Institute, the total military expenditure of all \r\nStates in 2014 exceeded $1.7 trillion, or approximately \r\n2.3 per cent of the global gross domestic product. \r\nTherefore, in order to guarantee the programmes that \r\nwe have adopted and to ensure them the large-scale \r\nfinancing they need, I once again make a proposal for \r\nthe annual allocation by each State of 1 per cent of its \r\nannual defence budget to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals Fund. That would help us to fulfil the development \r\nplan we have adopted.\r\nMr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nToday, history once again gives us a chance to unite \r\non behalf of a common bright future. The best thing \r\nwe can do is to not allow the hopes of humankind to \r\nrun aground on the reefs of contemporary challenges \r\nand threats. Kazakhstan is ready to make every effort \r\nand to allocate its resources towards the goal of global \r\ndevelopment.\r\nI wish everyone every success, and prosperity to all \r\nthe countries of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan for his statement.\r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Romania.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Iohannais: It gives me great pleasure to \r\nparticipate in this Summit, which has just adopted the \r\nprogrammatic document entitled “Transforming Our \r\nWorld: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” \r\n(resolution 70/1), in this year when the international \r\ncommunity celebrates the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe new Agenda aims to eradicate poverty in \r\nall its forms and to achieve sustainable development \r\nin its three dimensions in a balanced and integrated \r\nmanner. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nthe 169 targets confirm the comprehensiveness of the \r\nnew Agenda. The work ahead of us in the next 15 years \r\nwill demonstrate whether all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations can fully commit themselves to the \r\nachievement of the ambitious and noble aspiration to \r\nfree people from the scourge of poverty.\r\nIt is our common duty to define the proper solutions \r\nfor that quest at a time when science and technology \r\nare full-f ledged assets with outstanding prospects for \r\npromoting economic growth. We should be aware that \r\nthe measures aimed at eradicating poverty represent \r\nnot only a moral commitment but also a means for \r\npromoting international peace and security.\r\nInternational peace and security, a major objective \r\nof the United Nations, cannot be fully promoted without \r\n15-29247 15/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\npaying special attention to development. We should \r\napproach the roots of conflict, which include poverty, \r\nlack of hope, despair and social exclusion. Poverty can \r\nlead to despair and frustration, which can serve as the \r\nseeds of extremism and violence. At the same time, \r\npeace and security, at the international and the national \r\nlevels, are the major prerequisites for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nAs we saw in the past month, hundreds of thousands \r\nof people f leeing war and searching for a better life \r\nhave crossed into Europe, often by risky means. That \r\never-increasing influx of migrants from the Middle \r\nEast and Africa has left European countries struggling \r\nto cope with a growing humanitarian disaster. That \r\ncrisis is complex and has humanitarian aspects, as well \r\nas leading to further crises in the border protection, \r\nintegration and financial areas. If we do not find the \r\nmost adequate means to address each of them, each \r\nwave of migration will be bigger than the previous one. \r\nEvery nation has an obligation to rescue people and to \r\nsupport and protect them.\r\nThe new development Agenda goes far beyond the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, maintaining themes \r\nsuch as poverty eradication, education and health while \r\nintroducing new ones such as the establishment of \r\npeaceful and inclusive societies. The new Agenda has \r\na universal character, maintains a balance among the \r\neconomic, environmental and social goals, addresses \r\nmajor means of implementation and pleads for a global \r\npartnership in its implementation. \r\nAll countries should ensure that appropriate policies \r\nare in place for implementing the Agenda. Countries \r\nshould promote effective and inclusive institutions and \r\ncreate policies based on the rule of law, human rights, the \r\nrights of women, gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women. National ownership and accountability are of \r\nkey importance for the implementation of the Agenda, \r\nin terms of commitments and instruments such as \r\nsustainable development strategies. Each country has \r\nthe primary responsibility for its own development. We \r\nfully support the idea that the new Agenda should be \r\nimplemented by local institutions, responding directly \r\nto citizens’ needs. Their needs, interests and concerns \r\nmust be clearly addressed when local and national \r\nstrategies are defined.\r\nIn the case of Romania, we will revise our national \r\nstrategy on sustainable development in order to integrate \r\nthe new Sustainable Development Goals. Social \r\nexclusion has been identified as a major impediment to \r\nthe local implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. The revised strategy will emphasize supporting \r\nthe inclusion of disabled people, young people and \r\nwomen in development policies. Eradicating poverty \r\nrequires decent employment opportunities, while social \r\ncohesion policies are needed to avoid and prevent social \r\nexclusion. We stand ready to participate in the process \r\nof reviewing and monitoring the implementation of \r\nthe new Agenda, to share our experience with other \r\nMember States and to exchange lessons learned as well \r\nas positive results of the process.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of \r\nRomania for his statement.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Ionannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nBelarus.\r\nMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, President of the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Lukashenka (spoke in Russian): Sustainable \r\ndevelopment is impossible without peace and security. \r\nThe people of Belarus learned to fully appreciate \r\nthat absolute truth through their own fate. In the past \r\ncentury, Belarus became a site for the bloodiest battles \r\nof two World Wars. That is why we attach the utmost \r\nimportance to the prevention of military conflicts and \r\nthreats to people’s lives. After losing one third of its \r\npopulation in the struggle against fascism, Belarus \r\nrose from the ashes and now strives to preserve peace \r\nand social harmony as a sacred task, while seeking to \r\nensure the nation’s well-being and pursue sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nDuring the years of its sovereignty our country \r\nhas honourably achieved the Millennium Development \r\nGoals related to the eradication of hunger and poverty \r\nand has ensured 100 per cent literacy in its population, \r\nalong with equality between men and women, social \r\nand political stability and non-discrimination on ethnic \r\nand religious grounds. We do not have a maternal \r\nmortality problem. Infant mortality in Belarus is the \r\nlowest in the world.\r\nWhat I have described is the result of true \r\ndemocracy, and not what Western teachers try to impose \r\non us. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for our \r\nplanet in general. Unfortunately, the world has come to \r\nthis Summit as dissociated and divided as it has ever \r\n16/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nbeen during the past three decades. The planet is being \r\nshaken by numerous conflicts and acts of terrorism. \r\nRegrettably, no adequate solution has been found to an \r\nincreasing number of global threats.\r\nTo date, we have been unable to restore the balance \r\nof power that was lost with the collapse of the Soviet \r\nUnion. Without such a balance, there can be neither \r\npeace nor stability. There is a systemic crisis. In any \r\nsystem, a single force, if it goes unchecked, seeks \r\nprosperity only for itself at the expense of others. A \r\npolicy of hegemony and national egoism leads to the \r\nwidespread use of pressure, sanctions, restrictions and \r\nmilitary action. Consequently, we are losing trust in \r\none another. Examples of open political skulduggery, \r\nlies and crimes against humanity are all too apparent.\r\nLet us recall some recent facts. On the pretext of the \r\npresence of nuclear weapons in Iraq, certain countries, \r\nwhich are well known, decided to democratize Iraq. \r\nAnd where were those nuclear weapons? Where is \r\ndemocracy now in Iraq? Why was the President of Iraq \r\nmurdered? Where does that country stand today, and \r\nwhere is the future of the Iraqi people? Has life become \r\nbetter for people in that land? We can answer that it has \r\nnot. Those responsible for what happened in Iraq claim \r\nthat they made a mistake. They should have desisted. \r\nbut once again, that was not what happened. They went \r\neven further. They began with Tunis and moved on to \r\nLibya. The scenario was exactly the same. President \r\nAl-Qadhafi was crucified and his State was destroyed. \r\nHas the situation in Libya improved? The answer again \r\nis no. And does Libya exist as a intact State?\r\nThat should have been enough, but then they went \r\ninto Syria. We ask them why? Why are they killing \r\nmore people? Why do they seek to overthrow a sitting \r\nPresident? How does he not suit them? Moreover, in \r\nfacilitating the massacres in Syria, they are erasing the \r\nearliest traces of our common civilization. They should \r\ntell the world what they really want and what they are \r\nstriving for.\r\nNow, about the Ukrainian crisis. If we do not stop \r\nthe bloodshed in Europe, that internecine massacre, \r\nthan we will be facilitating the escalation of a conflict \r\nwith dire results for the civilized world. If we take one \r\nmore step towards global conflict, we might very well \r\nset off a new world war in the heart of the civilized \r\nand progressive world. Can it really be, in this new \r\nmillennium, that we have yet to understand how fragile \r\nthe world and human civilization are?\r\nI say that not just to list well-known world events, \r\nbut so that the powerful of the world might understand \r\nsomething, namely, that today there is no force that will \r\nstop them. But the Heads of State who are carrying out \r\nsuch blasphemy are all believers. Many of them even \r\npray in public, but the Lord sees everything, and he is \r\njust. If he should grow wrathful and punish the guilty, \r\nthen all peoples will suffer innocently because of the \r\ngambles of those leaders. I implore them to stop. We \r\nneed to help the people of the poorer countries to dress \r\nthemselves, to take care of themselves and obtain an \r\neducation. If those leaders feed the hungry and save \r\nchildren from catastrophes, they will receive what is \r\njustly theirs.\r\nBut mutual alienation is typical not only of big \r\ncountries, but also of small countries. There are many \r\nwho do not even have the slightest desire to understand \r\nthe traditions, convictions and cultures of other peoples. \r\nIt is apparent that restoring a balance will take a long \r\ntime in a polarized world. We will get closer to that goal \r\nonly if we take action, rather than sitting and waiting \r\npassively. We need to acknowledge that, in practice, \r\nwe are all different and that every nation has the right \r\nto choose its own path to development. Our diversity \r\ncan ensure a common progress and everyone’s success. \r\nSuch an approach will help us to restore trust in our \r\ninternational relations, but in order to do so, we need \r\nto meet and talk to one another and look for ways for \r\nconstructive interaction. And once we have reached an \r\nagreement, we will need to act.\r\nHistory teaches us that anyone claiming unilateral \r\nleadership, without regard for the interests of others, is \r\nultimately doomed to fail. Any advantage gained at the \r\nexpense of others is short-lived and waning. A popular \r\nfolk saying says that one cannot build one’s happiness \r\non the misfortunes of others.\r\nToday’s world is experiencing a crisis of responsibility. \r\nSelf-interest and momentary advantages are at the \r\ncore of many decisions. In the international arena, the \r\nactions of a number of States often fail to take into \r\naccount the specific realities and particularities of \r\nother countries and societies. I am confident that with \r\na different approach, we would not have seen hundreds \r\nof thousands of victims in Iraq, Libya, Syria and other \r\ncountries, from which refugees are f leeing in an attempt \r\nto escape war. There would have been no Islamic State, \r\nno acts of terror in Europe nor civil war in Ukraine. The \r\nlist of such “would not have beens” could be quite long.\r\n15-29247 17/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nIt is important to speak of this today, because \r\notherwise these countries, these peoples,  will not \r\nunderstand us when we talk about development, given \r\nthat millions if not billions of people lack access to the \r\nconditions that would allow them to live from one day \r\nto the next. Today, we need responsible politicians, \r\ncapable of acting globally and strategically, willing to \r\nmake decisions in the interest of the entire international \r\ncommunity, as well as compromises for the common \r\ngood.\r\nWhile at the United Nations, I cannot help but \r\nmention the crisis affecting international institutions. \r\nIn recent years, one has gained the impression that their \r\nrole has been reduced to that of a mere venue for disputes \r\namong States or for pressuring individual countries \r\nthat do not please the powerful of this world. We need \r\nonly look at the multitude of resolutions adopted at \r\nthe United Nations. Does voting on them help solve \r\nconflicts? Does that voting help unite the international \r\ncommunity? Do those resolutions improve people’s \r\nlives? Let us give an honest answer: no. After taking \r\na vote, we return to being separated into our different \r\ncamps. As a result, there is even more mistrust and \r\ndisengagement.\r\nI am deeply convinced that the United Nations \r\nshould not be used to demonstrate one’s power. \r\nThat behaviour weakens the Organization, destroys \r\nconfidence in it and runs contrary to its very nature \r\nand mission. It is hardly surprising that traditional \r\ninternational organizations have played an insufficient \r\nrole in preventing and settling conflicts. We must put \r\nan end to such deplorable practices. The United Nations \r\nmust be a forum for cooperation among States, not one \r\nfor confrontation.\r\nOnly mutual understanding and responsibility, an \r\nawareness of the diversity of the world community and \r\nthe renewal of trust will help us unite in safeguarding \r\npeace and security and ensure that we can find \r\neffective responses to global challenges and threats. \r\nThe sustainable development of all countries and a \r\nbroadening of the role of the United Nations will be \r\nthe practical result of our common efforts and of the \r\nconsolidation of the Organization’s role in global \r\npolitics.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Belarus for his statement.\r\nMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, President of the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic  Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Sirisena (spoke in Sinhalese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): Since its inception, the \r\nUnited Nations has always striven to make human life \r\nmore rational, meaningful and prosperous. As world \r\nleaders, it is our responsibility and duty to build such \r\na world. \r\nThe Government of Sri Lanka fully supports the \r\npost-2015 sustainable development agenda and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and targets that the \r\nAssembly has just adopted in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). Accordingly, \r\nI declare that the Government of Sri Lanka will act \r\nwith determination as a pioneer of the eco-sensitive \r\ncivilization that is emerging in the twenty-first century.\r\nSustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium \r\nbetween social and economic development and \r\nenvironmental protection. The Government of Sri Lanka \r\nanticipates achieving those Goals fully by 2030. We will \r\nwork to meet the basic needs of the people, progressively \r\nalleviate poverty, eliminate all forms of discrimination \r\nand inequality and establish a society based on social \r\njustice and human security. At the same time, while \r\nemphasizing the protection of our natural resources, \r\nwe will also formulate a State policy on resource \r\nconsumption based on environmental sustainability. We \r\nwill strive to ensure that the relevant policy framework \r\nis implemented within an institutional structure based \r\non the principles of good governance espoused by my \r\nGovernment. Special attention will also be given to \r\nthe concept of environmental good governance as an \r\nintegral part of our governance policies. We will ensure \r\nthat civil society and the business sector, as well the \r\nState sector, participate in those efforts. \r\nSustainable development cannot be achieved by \r\na single country alone. Our strategy will therefore \r\nenvisage a framework for cooperation among the United \r\nNations, regional organizations and other States.\r\nSri Lanka will be fully committed to dealing with \r\nSustainable Development Goal 13, relating to climate \r\nchange. We will strive to minimize the risks of possible \r\nenvironmental hazards. I firmly believe that a proper \r\nstudy is required to ascertain how climate change \r\n18/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\naggravates Sri Lanka’s contemporary development \r\nchallenges, such as poverty alleviation, food security, a \r\ngrowing elderly population and natural disasters.\r\nI wish to affirm that, in the preparation of \r\ndevelopment policies for Sri Lanka as an aspiring \r\nupper-middle income country, our special attention is \r\nfocused on Sustainable Development Goal 1, poverty \r\nalleviation; Goal 2, achieving food security; Goal 7, \r\nenergy; Goal 4, education; Goal 10, minimizing income \r\ndisparity, and Goal 11, urban development. Sri Lanka’s \r\nrich history, dating back beyond 2,500 years, provides \r\nus with inspiration and strength in that endeavour.\r\nI would like to conclude with the English translation \r\nof an ancient Pali blessing that also accompanies the \r\npreamble to the Constitution of Sri Lanka: “May the \r\nrains fall in due season” — signifying environmental \r\nbalance; “may the harvest be bountiful” — signifying \r\neconomic prosperity; “may the world prosper” and \r\n“may the ruler be righteous” — signifying good \r\ngovernance. That shows that, even centuries ago, our \r\nancestors possessed the wisdom and awareness of the \r\nsustainable development triangle. As inheritors of that \r\ntraditional knowledge and influenced by its ancient \r\nwisdom, which it will adapt to meet the requirements of \r\nthe modern era, Sri Lanka stands prepared to meet the \r\nchallenges successfully and march forward gloriously \r\ninto the twenty-first century. May the Noble Triple \r\nGem bless you!\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMalta.\r\nMs. Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Coleiro Preca: We come together at a \r\ncritical moment in our history, a moment that calls more \r\nthan ever for global solidarity, having undertaken a huge \r\ncommitment to safeguarding human dignity and human \r\nrights. This is a moment when we must believe that we \r\nare capable of challenging the boundaries imposed by \r\ndogmatic conventions and narrowness of thought. We \r\nmust believe and manifest the growing commitment felt \r\nso keenly across our nations to building and sustaining \r\ninclusive communities. We must find ways of ensuring \r\nthat meaningful dialogue and shared understanding \r\namong peoples of diverse cultures will enrich and \r\nsupport our commitment.\r\nThis is a moment in which to be mindful of the \r\nfar-reaching and often insidious effects of inequality. \r\nThe cycle of power, privilege and oppression constrains \r\nopportunities, restricts development and limits self-\r\ndetermination for millions of people around the globe. \r\nWe must interrupt those processes and work for social \r\njustice in the knowledge that such systems of inequality \r\ncan never define the human person. Stories of inequality \r\nf lood our media every day. We hear stories of people \r\ndenied their most fundamental rights. We hear stories \r\nof individuals and groups facing discrimination, stories \r\nof extreme poverty and of people suffering from the \r\neffects of climate change, and stories of the vulnerable, \r\nexploited and abused.\r\nThe precariousness of the world calls for us to make \r\na greater effort to address those inequalities, which \r\ncontinue to hinder our progress. But how can we talk \r\nabout progress without talking about the women, girls \r\nand gender minorities who continue to face a multitude \r\nof inequalities on a daily basis? How can we talk about \r\nsustainability without addressing the millions of people \r\nfacing poverty? How can we talk of inclusiveness \r\nwithout reaching out beyond the safety of our centres \r\nof privilege?\r\nIf we are serious about our commitment to securing \r\na sustainable world, we must implement measures that \r\nare capable of taking a critical, ref lective look at the \r\nsystems that underpin and replicate inequalities on \r\na global scale. As leaders, we cannot look away. As \r\nleaders, we must remain steadfast champions of social, \r\neconomic and political inclusion. As leaders, we must \r\nalways give voice to the shared truths of our global \r\ncommunity. As leaders, we must become advocates \r\nfor the peace and well-being of all. Sometimes that \r\nmight not be the most popular position to take. We \r\nmust be bold and defend the rights of vulnerable people \r\nwherever they are found. Human dignity, stability and \r\nfreedom should be at the heart of our concerns. On the \r\nother hand, it is inspiring to see so many of us united in \r\nthis global commitment to improve our world.\r\nOur endorsement of the 2030 Agenda will better \r\nthe lives of many and set in motion the processes of \r\nchange that will encourage deep levels of cultural and \r\nstructural transformation. Our commitment should \r\n15-29247 19/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\ninstil more respect for fundamental human and other \r\nrights. We must take a stand where and when those \r\nrights are violated. The international community must \r\nstand firm in its rights-based approach to effectively \r\naddress these realities. We must collaborate with each \r\nother and with other stakeholders, walking along a \r\nshared path to achieve common objectives. \r\nGovernments are not alone in pursuing their \r\ngoals. The role of civil society is key, and I encourage \r\nnon-governmental and other organizations to actively \r\nparticipate in the global transformation we envision \r\ntoday.\r\nFuture generations will judge us by the efforts we \r\nmake, but efforts alone are not enough. We must come \r\ntogether as peers to deliver results and real change \r\nto benefit all humankind. The poor have waited long \r\nenough. It is time to act.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Malta for her statement.\r\nMs. Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malta, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President and Head of Government of \r\nthe Republic of Djibouti.\r\nMr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and Head \r\nof Government of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Guelleh (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session for \r\nhis leadership and excellent work that enabled us to \r\nsuccessfully conclude two important negotiations \r\nprocesses, namely, the third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development and, yesterday morning, \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda that we have just \r\nadopted (resolution 70/1).\r\nI would also like to welcome and encourage the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession, which marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nour Organization and is historic on several counts. \r\nThe current session will be an opportunity to review \r\nthe achievements and untiring efforts of the United \r\nNations in the areas of peace and security, development \r\nand the promotion of human rights, and it will also see \r\nthe renewed commitment of Member States to a more \r\nsecure and just world that is better preserved for future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe Development Agenda that we have just \r\nadopted, entitled “Transforming our world: the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development”, includes \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 169 \r\nambitious, universal targets aimed at transforming all \r\nsocieties by focusing on sustainable development, to \r\nbe achieved through eradicating poverty and hunger, \r\nfighting inequality, ensuring the empowerment of \r\nwomen and girls and leaving no one behind; through \r\nstrengthening sustainable economic development \r\nwith the transformation and promotion of sustainable \r\npatterns of consumption and production; through the \r\nprotection of our planet by combating climate change; \r\nand, finally, through the establishment of effective, \r\ninclusive and accountable institutions with a view \r\nto realizing sustainable development and thereby \r\nachieving a revitalized global partnership.\r\nMr. Rasmussen (Denmark), Co-Chair, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe new Development Agenda also takes into \r\naccount the gaps and challenges observed during the \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) in a number of countries. It is important \r\nto recognize the tangible progress achieved by the \r\nAfrican countries, including mine, in the achievement \r\nof the MDGs. Although challenges remain, genuine \r\nresults were achieved in education, maternal and child \r\nhealth and in the fight against HIV/AIDS and other \r\ncommunicable diseases.\r\nThe example of which I am most proud, which I \r\nwish to share with the Assembly, is progress in food \r\nsecurity, thanks to national social development policies \r\npaired with regional cooperation strategies, which have \r\nhelped boost agricultural production in our country. \r\nThis has made it possible to reduce by half extreme \r\npoverty and hunger, as well as infant mortality. The \r\nRepublic of Djibouti had the great honour to be among \r\nthe countries rewarded by the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations in June 2015 for \r\nachieving those two MDGs despite drastic climatic \r\nconditions.\r\nIt is important in this pivotal year for sustainable \r\ndevelopment that the challenges and deficits that slowed \r\nthe implementation of the MDGs be duly avoided and \r\ncorrected. The financial resources mobilized both \r\nnationally and through international cooperation \r\nwill be critical to the implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Official development assistance \r\nis crucial for the least developed countries, and it is \r\n20/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nimperative that the commitments made to them by \r\ndevelopment partners be finally honoured.\r\nThe conference to adopt the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda was an important occasion during which \r\nthere were international commitments for increased \r\ndevelopment financing, including through official \r\ndevelopment assistance, the promotion of foreign \r\ndirect investment, and technology transfer, as well as \r\ncommerce. It was also clearly agreed that because of the \r\nhigher estimates of financial requirements necessary to \r\nachieve the SDGs, the financing sources are multiform \r\nand will come from public and private sources, both \r\nnational and international. To me it seems clear that the \r\nSDGs will not be realized by 2030 unless each Goal \r\nis accompanied by adequate funding and by relevant \r\nindicators for each socioeconomic reality that will \r\nenable us to assess the results.\r\nClearly, for successfully achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and financing for development, all \r\ncountries must increase their resilience by adopting a \r\nsustainable development model firmly directed towards \r\na low-carbon future. Although countries like mine \r\ncontribute little to the deterioration of the environment \r\nand climate change, they nevertheless suffer the \r\nconsequences, which include droughts and recurrent \r\nf loods. The effects of climate change primarily affect \r\nwomen, young people, the elderly and particularly \r\nthose living in rural areas.\r\nIt is essential that the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, in Paris, succeed and that all States seize that \r\nopportunity to make a serious, or even legally binding, \r\ncommitment to curb the effects of climate change in the \r\nshort term by slowing down greenhouse gas emissions, \r\non the one hand, and, on the other, by adopting medium- \r\nand long-term policies and programmes for the \r\nreconstruction of ecosystems and by favouring solutions \r\nbased on responsible environmental behaviour. That \r\nwill help us individually and collectively to remedy the \r\ngrowing inequalities among and within States and will \r\nallow for autonomy for all and better social protection.\r\nThere is no doubt that achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals is intrinsically linked to national \r\nownership of this Agenda by our respective countries. \r\nAs African countries, we welcome the Common African \r\nPosition and its six pillars, as well as the priorities of \r\nour continental agenda, Agenda 2063, which have \r\nbeen integrated into the SDGs, as reflected in the 2030 \r\nAgenda. \r\nI want to stress that in the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda — whose motto is “Leave no one \r\nbehind” — it is important that the national priorities \r\nfor sustainable development, the laws and the specific \r\nsocial, cultural, moral and religious characteristics \r\nof each State and each society lie at the heart of this \r\nuniversal and inclusive Agenda, which is based on \r\nuniversally recognized human rights.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming the strong \r\npolitical will of the Republic of Djibouti to continue to \r\nwork so that the socioeconomic development respectful \r\nof the environment as set out in the 2030 Agenda \r\nbecomes the path we follow determinedly in the coming \r\nyears and future generations.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the President and \r\nHead of Government of the Republic of Djibouti for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and Head \r\nof Government of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I now call on the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nMr. James Wani Igga, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Igga (South Sudan): Despite the fact that \r\nSouth Sudan was born 11 years after the Millennium \r\nSummit in New York in September 2000, which set \r\nthe Goals that aimed at improving the environment for \r\nhumankind, the Millennium Development Goals have \r\nbecome benchmarks that will guide our planning for \r\ndecades to come. While we might realistically have been \r\nincluded in the time frame as a country — side-by-side \r\nwith such noble undertakings — but were not simply \r\nbecause we had not yet been born, we have nevertheless \r\nachieved something in that direction, setting our own \r\ntime frames and parameters.\r\nAs for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand their 169 targets, apparently they are going to \r\ncost the world nearly $45 trillion in just one year, and \r\nthey clearly overlap. As uphill as the task may seem, \r\nSouth Sudan has selected and focused on just six \r\nof the Goals, in line with our priorities. Our number \r\none Goal is food security and agriculture; second is \r\ninfrastructure, including roads; third are energy and \r\nhydropower; fourth is health; fifth is education; and \r\nsixth is economic growth, alongside full, productive \r\n15-29247 21/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nemployment. Although the Government has the will \r\nto achieve those Goals, our chief impediment will \r\ncertainly be financial.\r\nThe gap between the industrialized and the \r\ndeveloping worlds could be closed through the simple \r\ninstrument of economic growth, which has damaged the \r\nenvironment. While the developed world remains the \r\nexclusive emitter of greenhouse gases and responsible \r\nfor climate change, we in the Third World must be \r\nhelped in promoting the production of green energy \r\nfor powering our imminent industrial growth, thereby \r\npreventing the negative socioeconomic implications of \r\necological damage.\r\nThe need for energy and the parallel need for \r\nfinancial resources are competing priorities for \r\ncountries emerging from protracted civil wars. One of \r\nthe main triggers of the 21-year war for independence \r\nin South Sudan was related, inter alia, to preventing \r\nthe ecological damage that would have been created by \r\ndraining one of the five largest wetlands in the world, \r\nmeasuring almost 57,000 square kilometres. As large \r\noil deposits have been discovered in the Sudd region, \r\nwe call on the world to help us make the necessary \r\ntrade-off in order to protect the ecology of the vital \r\nglobal resource in the southern part of my country.\r\nIndeed, the conflict between the ecology and the \r\neconomy — the main preoccupation of the agenda \r\nof the United Nations Conference on the Human \r\nEnvironment in Stockholm in 1972 — remains today \r\nthe key challenge to sustainable development in South \r\nSudan. We are more than committed to achieving that \r\nbalance. It is required of us, as members of the global \r\ncommunity. As we do so, we strongly believe in the \r\npositive spirit of the United Nations Conference on the \r\nFinancing for Development, in its call for strong support \r\nfor developing countries in achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nTo that end, there are important prerequisites for \r\nour journey together in achieving those noble Goals. \r\nOne of them is that the region-based intergovernmental \r\ncommittees, which are going to work closely with the \r\nGeneral Assembly in deploying international financial \r\nresources and technical know-how, should be given due \r\nweight. That will generate a cooperative environment in \r\nwhich the obstacles specific to sustainable development \r\nin Africa will be effectively addressed.\r\nIn conclusion, I must underscore that South Sudan \r\nis extremely rich in mineral and other natural resources, \r\nbut they remain untapped. While we remain among the \r\nleast developed countries in the world, services have \r\nimproved in numerous mushrooming urban centres \r\nof the country. We call upon our partners to visit and \r\nhold one of the expected numerous conferences on \r\nsustainable development in South Sudan. Considering \r\nthe fact that my country has zero greenhouse gas \r\nemissions, South Sudan’s rich and untapped natural \r\nresources make it a suitable test case for implementing \r\nthe post-2015 sustainable development agenda. Our \r\nnation, located exactly in the middle of the continent, \r\nstands to be a positive, regular contributor to the 2030 \r\nSustainable Development Agenda (resolution 70/1). We \r\nare firm in our resolve to continue in that direction, \r\nespecially given the favourable climate of peace and \r\nstability that is now being established in my country.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of South Sudan for his statement.\r\nMr. James Wani Igga, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Sharif (Pakistan): I am delighted to be part \r\nof a defining moment in history — the adoption of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda in the form of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1). We, as a global community, are committing \r\nourselves to a shared vision of inclusive growth and \r\ndevelopment, while ensuring that no one is left behind. \r\nOur new Agenda reflects both ambition and action in \r\nour joint effort to combat poverty, hunger and human \r\ndeprivation. \r\nAt the beginning of the century, we committed to \r\na development agenda that brought an international \r\nfocus on poverty, poverty eradication and human \r\ndevelopment. By putting people and their needs \r\nfirst, the Millennium Development Goals reshaped \r\ndecision-making processes and redefined national \r\npriorities. As a result, over a billion people were \r\nrescued from extreme poverty. Substantial gains were \r\nalso made in defeating hunger, illiteracy and disease. \r\nOur accomplishments, though many, were varied and \r\n22/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nunevenly distributed. Poverty, inequality and lack of \r\nopportunity remain stark realities in our time.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda is a collective \r\nresponse to those challenges. It represents a giant leap \r\nforward. The 17 broad and cross-cutting Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and the 169 associated \r\ntargets chart a development-centric and growth-\r\noriented pathway. The new Agenda posits itself on \r\nthe three dimensions of sustainable development, \r\nnamely, social justice, environmental stewardship and \r\neconomic well-being. It is, therefore, an agenda of \r\nchange that enjoys inherent vitality, as well as wide \r\nsocial acceptability. The focus is on transforming our \r\neconomies and livelihoods, building cohesive, just and \r\npeaceful societies and protecting our planet. Poverty \r\neradication remains at its core.\r\nOur journey does not end with the adoption of \r\nthe new Agenda. It has only just begun. The scope \r\nand magnitude of our new development framework is \r\nenormous. Delivering on it will require unwavering \r\npolitical will at both the national and the international \r\nlevels. Its implementation requires a paradigm shift \r\nin our political, social, economic and development \r\noutlook. \r\nWe know from experiences in our own country \r\nthat strong and sustained economic growth has to be \r\nat the heart of any effort to achieve those goals. Social \r\ndevelopment requires synergies among key development \r\npriorities, including employment generation, energy \r\nsecurity, demographic challenges, disaster-risk \r\nreduction and governance. It entails expanding access \r\nto energy and infrastructure and making them available \r\nto a larger proportion of the population.\r\nIt will be equally important to address both \r\nsystemic issues and structural constraints. Credible and \r\ntimely data are needed to underpin our success. They \r\nare critical enablers for success. Most importantly, the \r\nmeaningful implementation of the new Agenda demands \r\nmatching resources. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\non financing for development provides a promising \r\nstart. It complements the means of implementation \r\noutlined in the new development framework. We must \r\ndeliver on those commitments.\r\nDevelopment strategies remain, first and foremost, \r\nnational undertakings. The eradication of poverty and \r\ndisease and the provision of a better standard of living \r\nare among our abiding commitments to our people. \r\nFor Pakistan, the Sustainable Development Goals \r\ncomplement our own development needs and priorities, \r\nwhich are outlined in our Vision 2025. That document \r\nprovides a policy framework for integrating the new \r\nGoals into our national economic and development \r\nplanning. It is also a blueprint of our political \r\ncommitment to the process. The Government has \r\ninitiated a series of wide-ranging reforms aimed, inter \r\nalia, at expanding our resource base, stemming illicit \r\ncapital outf lows and ensuring optimum use of existing \r\nresources. We are equally aware of the importance \r\nof a robust monitoring and follow-up mechanism \r\nfor effective and full implementation of the SDGs \r\nin Pakistan. Elaborate coordination and oversight \r\nprocedures have, accordingly, been put in place at both \r\nthe national and the provincial levels.\r\nWe also have a historic opportunity to reverse the \r\nthreatening tide of climate change. We must therefore \r\nnegotiate an outcome in Paris that is fair, equitable \r\nand guided by the principles of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. As we \r\ndo our part, we look forward to a revitalized global \r\npartnership that promotes and complements domestic \r\npolicies and priorities, in line with our development \r\nneeds.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for his statement.\r\nMr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Bel gium, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): The \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) should provide new impetus for our global \r\ncommitment. We face several challenges, which \r\nare largely interdependent, including climate and \r\nmigration, poverty and hunger, peace and security, \r\nand even extremism. Some of them are the causes \r\nor repercussions of other challenges. Some of them \r\nexacerbate others. In order to overcome those obstacles, \r\nwe need to share a universal and ambitious vision, but \r\nabove all, we need to share a vision to bring about \r\ngenuine transformation for our fellow citizens.\r\n15-29247 23/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nThe time for assessments, reports and studies has \r\npassed. Now, we must act and act in an organized and \r\nconsistent manner. The guiding concept for our action \r\nshould be to successfully meet the needs of current \r\ngenerations without jeopardizing the needs of future \r\ngenerations. The 2030 Agenda can be our compass \r\nfor the next 15 years. It is a universal, integrated and \r\ninterdependent Agenda. Seventy years after the United \r\nNations was established, multilateralism is needed, now \r\nmore than ever, to meet the challenges of this century.\r\nOur action has a solid foundation, namely, human \r\nrights. Belgium advocates for an approach founded on \r\nfundamental freedoms. Gender equality, the freedom of \r\nexpression, the freedom of opinion, the freedom of the \r\npress and the rule of law — they form at every turn the \r\npath to development. Amartya Sen has stated that no \r\nsubstantial famine has ever taken place in a functioning \r\ndemocracy. And I believe deeply in the correctness of \r\nthat assertion. I would ask everybody to think about it.\r\nI want to outline a couple of points that are \r\nimportant to my country.\r\nFirst, as regards peace and security, conflict \r\ndestroys the hopes of women and men for a dignified \r\nlife. Our development efforts will come to nothing \r\nwithout peace and without security. We must mobilize \r\nto push back wars and conflicts. Social inclusion, decent \r\nwork and social protection are essential in guaranteeing \r\nsustainable growth. The fight against inequality is an \r\nintegral part of our aspiration to achieve dignity for all.\r\nThat struggle also applies to non-discrimination, \r\nto which there should be no exception. I condemn \r\nall forms of racism, but I would also like to touch on \r\nother forms of discrimination that we see every day, \r\nbased, for example, on gender or sexual orientation. \r\nAnd from this high rostrum, I would like to launch \r\nan appeal for respect of the rights of homosexuals. \r\nUnder no circumstances anywhere in the world should \r\nhomosexuality be considered a crime. And we will be \r\nthe tireless advocates for the cause of the elimination of \r\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation.\r\nWomen’s rights and their equality with men should \r\nnot just be guaranteed, they should also be a reality. \r\nFull access to education for girls is needed to put an end \r\nto the incredible waste of human resources represented \r\nby women and girls kept in ignorance. Access to \r\nreproductive health, guarantees for sexual rights, \r\naccess to family planning and contraception — those \r\nare issues that I refuse to shy away from simply because \r\nthey make some people uncomfortable. From this \r\nrostrum, I would like to state our wish that all of those \r\nbarriers and taboos should fall.\r\nI would also like to talk about digitalization and \r\naccess to the Internet. That is also an area with potential \r\nfor development. We must, of course, avoid two main \r\npitfalls. Internet access must not be used as a means \r\nfor violating or controlling the private lives of people, \r\nand, on the other, it must not be used as a vehicle for \r\nbroadcasting hatred, extremism and radicalism. \r\nBelgium has also shown its commitment through its \r\ndevelopment aid. We have decided to devote half of our \r\ndevelopment aid to the least developed countries, and \r\nwe made a pledge to that effect at the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development in Addis \r\nAbaba. Besides public development aid, we also need \r\nto mobilize all of the other sources of aid. I am thinking \r\nof the mobilization and effective use of domestic \r\nresources.\r\nOf course, the private sector is a decisive partner in \r\ndevising strategies for facing development challenges. \r\nTransparency, the fight against corruption and the rule \r\nof law are key areas here. The private sector is a driver \r\nof economic growth, and public and private initiatives \r\nshould be mutually reinforcing. In that framework, the \r\nmodification of non-sustainable modes of production \r\nand consumption is also a main objective. Economic \r\ngrowth must go hand in hand with sustainable \r\nproduction and consumption. Today, innovations need \r\nto balance between reducing negative impacts on the \r\nenvironment and improving the quality of life. We \r\nadvocate large-scale investment in such initiatives. \r\nThe real work should start now. The size of the \r\ntask requires commitment on the part of all countries. \r\nBelgium and all of its institutions are committed. And \r\neach needs to take part in that universal vision.\r\nIn that same line of thought, each citizen can \r\ncarry out daily acts that would facilitate human rights \r\nand respect for our planet. Access to information and \r\neducation for sustainable development should also \r\nbe encouraged. We should also work to evaluate the \r\nprogress that has been accomplished and compare what \r\nhas been done with the fundamental indicators.\r\nIn conclusion, I stress the importance of the \r\nwork that has been done within the United Nations \r\nframework We worked together for several months to \r\ndraw up the 2030 Agenda. Each party demonstrated \r\n24/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nits responsibility and solidarity. We are meeting here \r\ntoday at the highest level to commit together.\r\nBelgium has always advocated proactive and \r\neffective multilateralism. I hope that the 2030 Agenda \r\nwill be a major success in this century. But that success \r\nwill depend on us and our tenacity. We must ensure that \r\nthose who succeed us in 15 years will be able to state \r\nwith pride that there was a positive outcome from the \r\nprocess that begins today, and that they can say “We \r\nhave succeeded”!\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Belgium for his statement.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh): We have joined the \r\npeople of the world in adopting a new universal agenda \r\nfor sustainable development. I commend all those who \r\ncontributed to developing the people-centred 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nIn 2000, I joined world leaders in adopting the \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). Over the \r\npast 15 years, we mobilized our people and resources \r\nto realize the commitments that we made then. We are \r\nhappy that we have attained almost all the targets of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), including \r\nthose related to poverty eradication, the reduction \r\nof maternal and child mortality and communicable \r\ndiseases. The realization of the MDGs has helped \r\nBangladesh to graduate to be a middle-income country.\r\nA key to our success has been our political \r\ncommitment and the conducive policy environment \r\nthat we created in Bangladesh. We have mobilized \r\nour national resources, enhanced capabilities and \r\nempowered people. We aligned our development policies \r\nand strategies early. We have engaged in partnerships \r\nwith a wide range of local and international actors. We \r\nalso developed numerous innovations and development \r\nsolutions across sectors. We ensured that inequality \r\ndid not increase and that our actions directly benefited \r\npeople. We are pleased that some of our solutions and \r\nexperiences are now part of the global solutions.\r\nBuilding on our experience, Bangladesh joined the \r\nlong process to craft a transformative agenda for the \r\nfuture. Now, we all must pledge to fully and effectively \r\nrealize the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda. To deliver on the SDGs, robust global \r\ncooperation is critical. In realizing the Agenda, we have \r\nto recognize the diverse national realities, capacities \r\nand levels of development, and respecting national \r\npolicies and priorities will be equally important in \r\nthat connection. We will have to address all forms of \r\ninequality across the Agenda.\r\nIn this collective journey, the international \r\ncommunity must deliver on its pledges to provide the \r\nmeans for implementing each Goal across the Agenda. \r\nWe need support in the areas of finance, technology, \r\ncapacity-building and debt. We must also ensure that \r\nglobal trading and the financial regime and institutions \r\nare fair and just.\r\nThe day before yesterday, the General Assembly \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda with great joy. As part of its \r\nnational preparation, Bangladesh is aligning its seventh \r\nfive-year development plan with that new global Agenda. \r\nWe have decided to set up a new national mechanism \r\nfor coordinating the Agenda’s implementation within \r\nthe Government under the overall supervision of my \r\nOffice.\r\nWe are all looking forward to delivering with \r\nsimilar ambition, focus and commitment on a global \r\ndeal on climate change in Paris in December. Climate \r\nchange is putting Bangladesh’s precious development \r\ngains at risk, and we must therefore ensure that our \r\nnew development agenda and the new climate deal will \r\ndeliver when it comes to protecting and harnessing \r\nthe present and future of humankind. Let us all work \r\ntogether to deliver on our 2030 Agenda.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister \r\nof the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for her statement.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Finance and Energy, Minister for National Security, \r\nPublic Administration, Disaster Management, Home \r\nAffairs, Information and Implementation of Grenada.\r\nMr. Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nFinance and Energy, Minister for National Security, \r\n15-29247 25/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nPublic Administration, Disaster Management, \r\nHome Affairs, Information and Implementation of \r\nGrenada, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Grenada): There is an old African \r\nproverb that says: if you want to travel fast, you go \r\nalone, but if you want to travel far, you go together. In \r\nmany ways, our path as a global civilization since the \r\nIndustrial Revolution has been one focused on speed and \r\nindividualism, as has been well documented in Thomas \r\nPiketty’s award-winning treatise on economics, Capital \r\nin the Twenty-First Century.\r\nThe road straight ahead of us does not go very far. \r\nIt commits all of humankind and its unborn generations \r\nto an inhospitable world where, according to a World \r\nBank report, the temperature will be 4° Celsius above \r\npre-industrial levels. It is a world of f loods, droughts \r\nand famines, a world of mass migrations, in which \r\ncommunities will surely rise up against communities \r\nand nations against nations. In the words of His \r\nHoliness Pope Francis, speaking in this very Hall, “Any \r\nharm done to the environment, therefore, is harm done \r\nto humankind” (A/70/PV.3, p. 3). That world of f loods, \r\ndrought, famine and mass migration is not down the \r\nroad. It is happening right now. This year of 2015 is set \r\nto be the warmest since record-keeping began in 1880.\r\nWe built the United Nations for the express purpose \r\nof avoiding such great calamities. We built it so that we \r\ncan go together and go very far. At this very moment \r\nin history, the entire future of our planet and human \r\ncivilization has come to a fork in the road. It offers a \r\nnew and broader pathway for many, not just for the few. \r\nIt is a pathway to a greener and cleaner world, and a \r\nmore just world, a world where we can travel together \r\nand go very far together. As the late Yogi Berra once \r\nsaid, “When you come to a fork in the road, take it.”\r\nIn my tri-island State of Grenada, Carriacou and \r\nPetite Martinique, ordinary Grenadians are increasingly \r\nseeing themselves as shepherds of the environment. In \r\nrecent history, Grenada, once considered to be below \r\nthe hurricane belt, has seen two successive hurricanes \r\ndevastate our people and cause damage amounting to \r\n200 per cent of our annual gross domestic product.\r\nWhen it comes to greening our economy, we have \r\nworked to pass a new electricity act with a view to \r\nmoving to 100 per cent renewables. That is in line with \r\nSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, on energy, and \r\nSDG 13, on climate. The United States has selected \r\nGrenada as a pilot country for the transformation of \r\nthe power sector in the Caribbean, and we are grateful \r\nfor that help. We are also appreciative of the support of \r\nChina, Venezuela, Germany, New Zealand and others, as \r\nwe seek to manage our energy challenges and transform \r\nthat important sector. SDG 17, on partnerships, is \r\ntherefore deeply ingrained in our approach, and as a \r\nsmall island developing State (SIDS), we also wish to \r\ncommend SIDS DOCK, an international partnership \r\nfor renewable energy in small island developing States. \r\nAs part of our green economy, we have also introduced \r\na price on carbon through a fuel levy, which is helping \r\nto improve our fiscal space. We are also introducing \r\nclimate-smart agriculture, in line with SDGs 13 and 15.\r\nCollectively, Grenada and its islands have 348 \r\nsquare kilometres of territory. But beyond that we have \r\n26,000 square kilometres of blue ocean space. Grenada’s \r\nblue economy is therefore vital and exemplified by \r\nour coastal tourism, the main driver of our economy. \r\nThat is why we have committed to conserving 20 per \r\ncent or more of our near-shore marine resources. And \r\nin line with SDG 14, on oceans, we are pleased to be \r\nworking with the Government of the Netherlands, the \r\nWorld Bank and others on the Global Network for \r\nBlue Growth and Food Security, along with a Blue \r\nGrenada investment strategy. Moreover, in April 2016, \r\nin concert with its partners, Grenada will host a global \r\nblue-growth investment conference designed to move \r\nthe needle on ocean health and wealth. The conference \r\nshould put ocean States in a better position to report \r\npositive results when they meet in Fiji in 2017 to review \r\nprogress on SDG 14. Grenada is also joining with \r\nDominica and the Marshall Islands to promote a new \r\ninitiative, entitled “We Are the Oceans”, which will \r\nbegin by educating our young people.\r\nThat brings me to my final point, concerning SDG \r\n4, on education. Education is critical to the future of \r\nour children and the entire planet. I am standing in \r\nthis Hall today because I was among the fortunate \r\nwho were granted an education. But not enough of our \r\nyoung people, at home or abroad, are getting access to a \r\nquality education. That is why my Government has set \r\naside the largest portion of its operating fiscal budget \r\nfor education. Already, education represents 20 per \r\ncent of Grenada’s gross domestic product. St. George’s \r\nUniversity in Grenada, which is training more and \r\nmore Grenadians, also produces one of every hundred \r\ndoctors practising in the United States.\r\nFinally, as part of my duty as the head of science \r\nand technology for the Caribbean Community, I \r\n26/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nwish to welcome President Obama’s invitation to the \r\nCaribbean States to send representatives to meet with \r\nthe Government of the United States and the United \r\nStates information and communications technology \r\nindustry in Silicon Valley. Such efforts not only \r\nunderscore the spirit of partnership but also point the \r\nway forward towards better education, more innovation \r\nand more jobs, as we seek to reduce global poverty and \r\ninequality in line with the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals on poverty, gender equality, employment, and \r\nindustry and innovation.\r\nIn closing, I wish to applaud the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts in presiding over the United Nations \r\nat a time when we have chosen a new path for a more \r\nsustainable world. With his continued leadership as \r\nwe head towards the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Paris, and beyond, we feel confident that, as \r\na global community, we are making the right move. He \r\ncan be assured of Grenada’s full support as we take this \r\nnew pathway for our people, for our planet, for peace \r\nand for prosperity — a path on which we will embark \r\ntogether and on which we will go far.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Finance and Energy, Minister for \r\nNational Security, Public Administration, Disaster \r\nManagement, Home Affairs, Information and \r\nImplementation of Grenada for his statement.\r\nMr. Keith Mitchell, Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nFinance and Energy, Minister for National Security, \r\nPublic Administration, Disaster Management, \r\nHome Affairs, Information and Implementation of \r\nGrenada, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of Malaysia.\r\nDato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nMr. Razak (Malaysia): The Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) adopted in 2000 set targets to be \r\ndelivered by 2015, and in the past 15 years there have \r\nbeen many significant achievements. The world has \r\nalso become far more inclusive. Access to education, \r\nhealth information, communications technology and job \r\nopportunities has broadened significantly. The MDGs \r\nalso brought national Governments, the international \r\ncommunity, civil society and the private sector together, \r\nall aiming at a common set of goals. It galvanized the \r\nnecessary political commitment, leveraged resources \r\nand spurred actions, and the results show what can be \r\nachieved when we recognize our common humanity \r\nand put our fellow man first.\r\nAt the same time, progress has been uneven. \r\nMillions are still suffering, especially the poorest and the \r\ndisadvantaged, because of their gender, age, disability, \r\nethnicity or even geographic locations. Targeted efforts \r\nwill be needed to reach the most vulnerable. Even \r\ntoday, around 800 million people still live in poverty \r\nand suffer from hunger. We may have met the target of \r\nhalving extreme poverty rates, but the world is still far \r\nfrom reaching the overall goal of eradicating poverty \r\nand hunger. That, then, must remain at the core of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda, and it is imperative that \r\nno one be left behind.\r\nMalaysia is absolutely committed to the post-2015 \r\nagenda, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nand our aspirations to transform the world by 2030. \r\nInclusivity and sustainable development have long \r\nbeen at the heart of our own transformation from a \r\ndeveloping country to one that is on course to achieving \r\nhigh-income status by 2020.\r\nBetween 1970 and 2014, the incidence of poverty in \r\nMalaysia was reduced from 49.3 per cent to 0.6 per cent, \r\nwhile hard-core poverty was eradicated. Mean monthly \r\nhousehold income has increased more than twenty-\r\nfold, from $277 in 1970 to $1,781 in 2014. Malaysia is \r\nnow about to embark on its next five-year development \r\nplan, the Eleventh Malaysia Plan: 2016-2020. In many \r\naspects the Plan mirrors the multidimensional nature of \r\nthe SDGs and has been formulated with the people at \r\nthe centre of all development efforts.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWhat we refer to as the “people economy” will \r\nbe given priority, reinforcing my Government’s \r\ncommitment to bringing further development to our \r\ncitizens by enriching their lives, providing them with \r\ndignity and enhancing their potential to share in \r\ngrowth and the fruits of prosperity. For the first time \r\nin the history of Malaysia, national growth targets will \r\ninclude not only gross domestic production growth \r\nand per capita income but also household income and \r\nthe Malaysian well-being index. We are committed \r\nto ensuring equitable opportunities for all, and the \r\nbottom 40 per cent of households in particular. That \r\nwill be done through initiatives that are focused \r\n15-29247 27/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\non outcome-based support and productivity-linked \r\nsystems and will include training in entrepreneurship \r\nskills, the adoption of technology, asset ownership \r\nand investment in improving connectivity and basic \r\namenities. We aim to double average income for the \r\nbottom 40 per cent of households, from $700 in 2014 \r\nto $1500 by 2020, elevating them to the middle class.\r\nWe will also raise the participation rate of women \r\nin the work force from 53 per cent to 59 per cent by \r\n2020, and we will transform rural areas by improving \r\nconnectivity and mobility and help them to become ever \r\nmore business-friendly environments. We are working \r\ntowards providing equal access to quality health care \r\nand affordable housing and will build more clinics and \r\nhospitals and affordable homes over the next few years.\r\nWe are determined to be good custodians of our \r\nenvironment, so that we preserve our natural resources \r\nand beautiful landscape for future generations. Green \r\ngrowth is no longer an option reserved for idealists, but \r\na practical necessity for us and for other Governments \r\naround the world. All this because we recognize that \r\nhuman capital is the most important resource for \r\ndevelopment, not just in Malaysia but in all our united \r\nnations. \r\nOn that note, allow me to reaffirm Malaysia’s \r\ncommitment to supporting and implementing the 2030 \r\nDevelopment Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nNot only is a better future within our grasp, but it is \r\nalso our duty to fight for it. I urge all those present to \r\njoin us in that noble and necessary endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of Malaysia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nDato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the President of \r\nthe Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nMr. Renzi (Italy): This is the time to erase poverty \r\nand hunger and to guarantee a safe ecosystem for future \r\ngenerations. I would like first of all to commend the \r\naction of the Secretary-General and the Organization’s \r\nelites for moving forward on the new Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. It is an achievement in and \r\nof itself. We have come up with a common Agenda with \r\nuniversal goals to be applied everywhere, without regard \r\nfor the different levels of development — an agenda that \r\nwill promote effective development sustainability and \r\nbreak new ground for the way we will act in the years \r\nto come. It is both an opportunity and a responsibility.\r\nWhat we need now is global action. Every nation \r\nis capable of addressing and meeting that very \r\nimportant challenge. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) envisages a new, truly \r\nglobal partnership, not only among Governments, but \r\namong parliaments, non-governmental organizations, \r\nbusinesses, citizens — every one has a role to play. \r\nThis unequivocally new global deal, based on five \r\nP’s — people, prosperity, partnership, planet and \r\npeace — will be a legacy for the next generation. Italy \r\nis ready to make important strides in this direction.\r\nAlthough Italy is the leading contributor of troops \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations, we know \r\nthat we need something more than just peacekeeping. \r\nBeyond peacekeeping, we need greater investment \r\nin, for example, education initiatives. And the new \r\nframework for sustainable development encompasses \r\npeace and security, the rule of law, the promotion of \r\nhuman rights, and effective and democratic governance \r\nand institutions.\r\nI feel compelled to take the opportunity afforded by \r\nthis special Summit to speak about the tragedy that has \r\nbeen unfolding for too long now in the Mediterranean \r\nSea. Shores that were once the cradle of civilization \r\nhave become the stage on which an undeserved \r\nstruggle, unbelievable suffering and an unacceptable \r\nloss of life are being played out daily. The f low of \r\ncountless desperate people trying to reach Europe to \r\nfulfil their simple aspiration of having a decent life is \r\nwithout precedent. It is the result of poverty and, worse, \r\nlack of development, and extremism.\r\nToo many have died. Many more have been rescued \r\non the open sea, and I am proud of my people for their \r\nefforts in saving so many. But these people without a \r\ncountry — who, as Pope Francis said, have escaped \r\nfrom countries of Africa and elsewhere — need a very \r\nclear answer today. Italy is aware of its own moral \r\nresponsibility and that of all the countries in the European \r\nUnion. We hope that we will succeed in reaching the \r\nvery important result of a common European asylum \r\nsystem. That is the only solution — not the building of \r\nwalls, but a common European asylum system.\r\n28/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nHowever, there is a new strategy before us. Our \r\nnew Agenda is a very good start. We endorse the 2030 \r\nAgenda across every sector, through our national \r\nGreen Act and in initiatives in the food and nutritional \r\nsecurity area, particularly with regard to exports. The \r\ninternational food exhibition in Milan is a platform \r\nthat Italy offers to the world for a global discussion on \r\nnutrition. The vast majority of countries represented \r\nin this Hall participate in it, and we take pride in \r\nthat. I would recall the message that comes from \r\nMilan — “Feeding the planet, energy for life” — which \r\nis a visionary motto, chosen more than eight years ago, \r\nthat touches directly upon our discussion today.\r\nAt the same time, we are ready to work in the right \r\ndirection in every field. I personally participated in \r\nthe third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, in Addis Ababa. I think it is crucial that \r\nwhen Italy heads the Group of Seven in 2017, it should \r\nlead the way by being one of the major international \r\ndonors. Italy is perfectly positioned to foster dialogue \r\nbetween Europe and Africa. Geographically speaking, \r\nItaly is a bridge. We must become a cultural bridge \r\nas well. And we must make significant investments \r\nin energy security, in small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises, in microcredit, and in public programmes \r\nfor development.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to acknowledge the \r\npeople who are suffering today, the countries paying the \r\nhighest price, particularly the small island developing \r\nStates and the countries of Africa. That said, I believe \r\nthat the 2030 Agenda is sending a message of hope. This \r\nnew Agenda, which calls for a new collective effort, \r\ndoes offer new hope for future generations.\r\nI would like to conclude on a personal note. \r\nInternational assistance — cooperation — is the reason \r\nwhy I am a politician. As a young man entering politics \r\nas a volunteer 20 years ago, I was already passionate \r\nabout the impact of development assistance on ordinary \r\npeople. I realized that I wanted to run for office and \r\nmake a difference. Politics is that — the possibility to \r\nmake a difference, not only at the level of Government, \r\nbut also for the people outside the Government. Twenty \r\nyears later, as the Prime Minister of my country, I am \r\nparticularly honoured to be able to say to the General \r\nAssembly that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is not just an opportunity for the official \r\ninternational community to orient itself; it is also the \r\nbest opportunity ever to bring a fairer future and hope \r\nto ordinary people.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Council of Ministers of the Republic \r\nof Italy for his statement.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Habib Essid, Head of Government of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Essid (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank and congratulate Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon and all those who participated in bringing \r\nabout the success of the negotiations on the post-2015 \r\nsustainable development agenda. I wish to express my \r\nesteem for their efforts in this area.\r\nI am more than a little proud to be taking part in this \r\nspecial Summit today, which has been convened by the \r\nUnited Nations to reflect the international community’s \r\nrecognition of how important development is and how \r\nthe issue is linked to the aspirations of all human beings \r\nto happiness, a dignified life, well-being, security and \r\nbalanced development, without discrimination. These \r\nrights apply in all countries.\r\nWorking with civil society, Tunisia adopted an \r\nintegrated development policy — overall and by \r\nsector — based on the complementarity between \r\ndemographic and environmental factors, on the one \r\nhand, and development factors, on the other hand. \r\nTunisia’s success in meeting most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) reflects the seriousness \r\nwith which our country is striving, together with \r\nother countries worldwide, to meet the challenges of \r\ndevelopment around the world. However, ours is only \r\na relative success, since we have recorded failures in \r\nthe form of gaps in development among regions and a \r\npersistently high level of unemployment, which has had \r\na negative impact on economic development.\r\nNotwithstanding the scale of these challenges, \r\npost-revolution Tunisia has adopted some radical \r\npolicy reforms. It has thus managed to consolidate the \r\nprinciples of the Republic, in particular the fundamental \r\nvalues of democracy and human rights, which are now \r\nenshrined in the Constitution of our Second Republic. \r\nWe also are working on a collective approach to reform \r\nbased on a national vision that was developed in a \r\n15-29247 29/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nfive-year development plan with a focus on achieving \r\nmaximum social justice and carrying out affirmative \r\naction policies designed to help those who experienced \r\ndiscrimination and marginalization in the past.\r\nTunisia played an active role in the preliminary \r\nnegotiations and efforts to create the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda as a member of the Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals. As such, \r\nwe were involved in various meetings and actively \r\nparticipated in negotiations among Governments with a \r\nview to their definition. We took a number of initiatives \r\nin Tunisia, such as consultative meetings in Tunis and \r\nin the various regions. We also, in cooperation with \r\nspecialized United Nations agencies, conducted various \r\nsurveys to find out the kind of Tunisia Tunisians \r\nwanted to have. Some of the survey results, drawn from \r\na sample of 10,000 participating citizens, who shared \r\ntheir aspirations and concerns with respect to our \r\nnational development programme, provided the basis \r\nfor our national plan.\r\nWhen preparating to participate in this Summit, we \r\ndecided that we would be forthright in expressing our \r\nviews on current concerns. We would like to reiterate \r\nthat the ongoing plagues affecting societies, such as \r\nterrorism, lack of security, and sectarian and ethnic \r\nconflicts, all require serious efforts on our part to \r\ntake into account the diverse development situations, \r\nespecially those in the most disadvantaged regions \r\nof the world. The achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda will depend on how serious the international \r\ncommunity is in translating those Goals into concrete \r\nreality on the ground so that no one is left behind or \r\nexcluded. \r\nTunisia is concerned about the need to establish a \r\nframework for follow-up mechanisms to ensure that the \r\nGoals are effectively implemented. To that end, we are \r\nestablishing partnerships with all stakeholders in civil \r\nsociety, Government and international organizations in \r\nfull transparency and with credibility and seriousness.\r\nFinally, I cannot conclude without reiterating my \r\ngratitude to all members of the international community \r\nfor working towards the aspiration for well-being of all \r\nhumankind. All such aspirations and principles serve \r\nas the foundation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe Head of Government of the Republic of Tunisia for \r\nhis statement.\r\nMr. Habib Essid, Head of Government of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Hellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Tsipras (Greece): It is very important that our \r\npost-2015 development agenda address the interrelated \r\nchallenges of eradicating poverty and achieving \r\nsustainable development by introducing a signal set \r\nof new Sustainable Development Goals that call for a \r\nbalance among the economic, social and environmental \r\ndimensions of development. But the questions remain. \r\nHow can we ensure that in the next 15 years we do \r\nnot repeat the same mistakes as in the past 15 years \r\nor the 15 before that? Why is it that in the past 30 plus \r\nyears the security, economic, social and environmental \r\nchallenges we face on a global and regional level stay \r\nthe same or get even worse?\r\nOur experience in Greece could be instructive. \r\nGreece is at the centre of three overlapping crises — a \r\neurozone economic crisis, as a result of neoliberal policy \r\nchoices that led to a 25 per cent decrease in our gross \r\ndomestic product in the past five years; a security \r\ncrisis, because of the increasing instability surrounding \r\nGreece in North Africa, the Middle East and the Black \r\nSea; and a refugee crisis, resulting in the mass migration \r\nof hundreds of thousands of people seeking a better life \r\nin Europe.\r\nIn order to face such challenges, we must set and \r\nstrive for goals such as the ones we discuss today, \r\nbut our experience in Greece shows that it will not be \r\nenough. None of the challenges we face in Greece, in \r\nour broader region, in Europe or even on a global level, \r\ncan be dealt with solely by setting goals and leaving \r\nthe framework in which we function untouched and \r\nbeyond dispute. We cannot talk substantially about aid \r\nto developing countries or loans from developed ones \r\nunless we tackle the issue of debt as an international \r\nchallenge at the centre of our global financial system. \r\nIn all competent forums, including this one, we need to \r\ntalk about how the restructuring or reprofiling of public \r\ndebt can be linked with development.\r\n30/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nHistorical experience shows that debt restructuring \r\nis necessary for recovery, even for developed countries, \r\nas was the case for Germany in 1953. We cannot talk \r\nabout the eradication of poverty or unemployment \r\nunless we can discuss how to build or improve welfare \r\nStates instead of destroying them. We must distance \r\nourselves from the neoliberal idea that markets are \r\nthe sole resource allocator in the economy. We also \r\ncannot talk about a solid State tax base when the global \r\nfinancial system supports and encourages tax havens \r\nand the founding of off-shore companies. In just the \r\nsame way, we cannot talk about a solid tax system \r\nunless democratically elected Governments retain the \r\nright to decide on whom they choose to lay the tax \r\nburden.\r\nA substantial development agenda can take root \r\nonly in an economic, financial and political environment \r\nthat fosters development. Greece, as a pillar of stability \r\nin our region, will consistently promote and support all \r\nefforts for such a global and European economic and \r\nfinancial system — a system that will allow our 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development to f lourish in the \r\nnext 15 years, rather than suffocating it as happened \r\nin the past 30 years. Of course, it will not be easy. As \r\nthe great economist John Maynard Keynes said, “The \r\ndifficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as \r\nin escaping from old ones.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe Prime Minister of the Hellenic Republic for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the First \r\nVice-President of the European Union.\r\nMr. Timmermans (European Union): It is \r\nastonishing just how much has happened since the \r\nMillennium Summit. We all know the figures, but if you \r\nactually picture the people behind them, they become \r\nmore than just numbers. Just think about it: a quarter \r\nof the world’s population was born after that Summit. \r\nToday, they are 15 years old or younger. Of all these \r\nkids, 9 out of 10 now get to go to school. Those who \r\nare babies or toddlers are half as likely to die as they \r\nwould have been in 1990, and their mothers are half as \r\nlikely to die in childbirth. For the girls among them, \r\ntheir chances of having real opportunities — even if \r\nby no means equal opportunities yet — have greatly \r\nimproved at school, at work and in life. In short, many \r\nmillions have come into a much better world than the \r\ngeneration before them.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have \r\nindeed made a difference and, as important, they helped \r\nus to unite against indifference. The European Union \r\nhelped to drive this agenda because it believes this is in \r\nessence what the United Nations was set up to achieve: \r\nsocial progress and a fairer future. \r\nWe are now ready for the next chapter. The MDGs \r\nshowed us that the lack of development of some \r\ncountries is a threat to all of us, but so is unsustainable \r\ndevelopment on a global scale. This is the challenge \r\nthat today we commit to overcoming together. \r\nThat makes the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) even more universal \r\nthan the previous one. The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) are not just for some countries, but for all \r\ncountries — rich and poor alike. Yes, the list is long, but \r\nthese Goals are comprehensive because they reflect the \r\nreality of today’s world and the way today’s problems \r\nare daunting, complex and interlinked.\r\nFor the very first time in the history of humankind, \r\nthe boundaries of the planet are actually within sight. \r\nInequalities are increasing and social cohesion is \r\neroding. Global competition for resources is at an \r\nall-time high. The models that worked for so many \r\nof us in the past are not ones that will work for all \r\nof us in the future. We have to redefine our societies \r\nand our relationship with nature. Of course, this \r\nfeels threatening, but fear can be a powerful engine. \r\nWe have to be creative because, fundamentally, this \r\nis about rethinking everything we do. This pertains \r\nto all of us — people, companies, Governments and \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nIn countries like ours, there is no excuse for not \r\nmeeting our 0.7 per cent target for official development \r\nassistance. It is more urgent than ever. But this time \r\nunder the SDGs it is not about just footing the bill. \r\nThose countries fortunate enough to have a developed \r\nor emerging economy are committed to playing a \r\ndifferent role. This is not just about development aid. It \r\nis just as much about change at home.\r\nMy main message, Europe’s message, to all these \r\ncountries is: it is also our turn now to step out of our \r\ncomfort zone. It is about very concrete questions: how \r\nwe have to turn around our economies to make them \r\ncircular, leaving behind our take-make-consume-and-\r\n15-29247 31/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\ndispose growth pattern and how we must mend our \r\nsocieties’ social fabric and how we integrate newcomers, \r\nwhich is all the more important when they come as \r\nrefugees f leeing war and persecution. It is about clean \r\nair, water and oceans. It is about more resilient cities that \r\nare healthy, inclusive and safe. It is about tackling food \r\nwaste. A third of the food worldwide is thrown away, \r\nwhich is frankly shocking beyond belief. It is about our \r\ncollective action to keep the global temperature rise \r\nbelow 2° Celsius.\r\nThese are not impossible goals. We have innovation \r\non our side to find solutions, if we have the will to act. \r\nIn Europe, we are determined to do this jointly and \r\nwe want to fully engage with the United Nations in \r\nexperience-sharing, capacity-building and progress-\r\nmonitoring. We want to do this together. The SDGs \r\nwill shape our development policy and infuse our \r\npolicies abroad and at home. Ultimately, this is all \r\nabout governance and inclusiveness. Societies will \r\naccept transformation only if people feel their voices \r\nhave been heard. It is also about breaking out of silos. \r\nSustainable development is not just an economic or \r\nsocial challenge or an environmental problem; it is all \r\nthree. Our efforts on each need to reinforce, rather than \r\nundermine, one another.\r\nThe Agenda is about eradicating poverty and \r\nputting sustainability at the heart of everything we do. \r\nThis is not just the right thing to do, it is the smart \r\nthing to do: for our economy, for our environment, for \r\nour society and for our children and grandchildren. We \r\nhave a world to transform. This common Agenda shows \r\nthe way how.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nUkraine.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum. \r\nPresident Poroshenko: On behalf of Ukraine, I \r\nexpress my full support for the new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nI would like to recall that back in 1992, Ukraine \r\ntook part in the historic United Nations Conference on \r\nEnvironment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, where \r\nit testified its will to shape the future on the basis of \r\nthe principles of sustainable development. Over the 23 \r\nyears that have passed since then, we have accumulated \r\nextensive positive experience and at the same time have \r\ntasted the bitterness of defeat as proponents of war and \r\nterrorism have been fiercely resisting progress in many \r\nparts of the world. \r\nThe far-reaching Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) and targets, which we declared at this historic \r\nSummit, open up new horizons for humankind and \r\nlay the foundations for the sustainable development \r\nof our planet for the next 15 years. We commend the \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness of the preparatory \r\nprocess, which culminated in the post-2015 development \r\nframework. More than 25,000 Ukrainians took part in \r\nthe global consultations and expressed their own vision \r\nof the SDGs. Working hard to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), which were set up 15 \r\nyears ago, our countries have considerably changed the \r\nlives of millions of people worldwide.\r\nAs for Ukraine, I would like to emphasize that \r\nit has managed to reduce threefold our poverty \r\nrates — but, because of the Russian aggression, we \r\nexpect this rate of reduction to drop; it has managed \r\nto improve the maternal health system; to almost halve \r\nchild mortality; to reduce HIV/AIDS incidence rates; \r\nand to make progress in combating tuberculosis. We \r\nwill keep on working to fulfil our commitments on the \r\nMDGs related to improving the quality of education, \r\npromoting gender equality and ensuring environmental \r\nsustainability. I am convinced that we have to build on \r\nthe momentum generated by the MDGs to make further \r\nprogress in the priority areas set out in the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nThere will be no sustainable development \r\nwithout peace and freedom. The bitter experience of \r\nUkraine reveals that peace and freedom are principal \r\npreconditions for achieving the SDGs. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment is not achievable where explosions are \r\nheard and peaceful people are killed. It is not achievable \r\nwhere aggressive ideologies advocating the suppression \r\nof some nations by other nations reign and key human \r\nrights and freedoms are violated.\r\nStrengthening universal peace and promoting \r\nlarger freedom should become a driving and unifying \r\nforce behind our collective efforts to achieve the SDGs. \r\nToday, Ukraine has to implement much needed systemic \r\nreform while opposing the Russian aggressor, which \r\nis attempting to undermine the democratic European \r\ndevelopment that the Ukrainian people have chosen.\r\nAs a result of Russia’s treacherous annexation of \r\nthe Ukrainian Crimea and its aggression in the Donbas \r\nregion, thousands of people have been killed, critical \r\n32/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\ninfrastructure has been ruined and Ukraine has lost \r\nabout one fifth of its economic potential. Russia’s \r\nmilitary actions against Ukraine have also increased \r\nenvironmental and epidemiological threats, along with \r\nthe risk of social exclusion. Chemical sites in the conflict \r\narea in the eastern part of Ukraine and in the adjacent \r\nterritories represent a particular danger. The threats \r\nof potential man-made technological catastrophes \r\nare severe. In that context, Ukraine believes that it is \r\nhigh time for the United Nations to address the issue \r\nof environmental protection in conflicts, and it will \r\npresent a specific idea to that end.\r\nThe external aggression has led to the emergence \r\nof a new form of poverty — sudden and unexpected \r\npoverty — that affects the lives of some 1.5 million \r\ninternally displaced persons. Each day of the war in \r\nDonbas costs us close to $5 million that we could have \r\ninvested in sustainable development. The crisis of the \r\napproximately 1.5 million internally displaced people \r\nis the biggest problem, not only for Ukraine but for the \r\nwhole region.\r\nUkraine aspires to peace and prosperity and, \r\ntogether with its partner States, is making maximum \r\nefforts to settle the conflict by peaceful diplomatic \r\nmeans. After putting an end to the military aggression, \r\nre-establishing peace and restoring Ukraine’s full \r\nsovereignty over the Donbas region and Crimea, it \r\nwill be essential to return millions of people to normal \r\nlife and to restore economic and social infrastructure \r\non a sustainable development basis. Ukraine stands \r\nready to accomplish that difficult task and calls on all \r\ninternational partners to cooperate towards that end.\r\nUkraine is steadfastly following the path of reform \r\nset out in its Strategy 2020 for sustainable development \r\nDespite existing challenges, we have translated our. \r\nstrategic tasks into tangible actions. Against the \r\nbackdrop of implementing its Association Agreement \r\nwith the European Union, as well as its resisting the \r\nongoing Russian aggression, the focus of Ukrainian \r\nsociety today is first and foremost on fighting \r\ncorruption; ensuring equal opportunities and social \r\njustice; maintaining an effective public health system; \r\npromoting decent work; ensuring affordable education \r\nfor all; promoting innovation, development and the \r\nbuilding of sustainable infrastructure; and ensuring a \r\nsustainable energy supply, food security and a healthy \r\nenvironment.\r\nI would like to assure those present that, in order \r\nto achieve the SDGs at the national level, Ukraine \r\nwill implement new programmes and projects aimed \r\nat ensuring macroeconomic stability, environmental \r\nbalance and social cohesion. The SDGs will serve as \r\nan overarching framework for further transformation in \r\nUkraine, including in the context of implementing our \r\nStrategy 2020.\r\nAs a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity, Ukraine seeks to take an active part in \r\naddressing current global challenges as a prerequisite for \r\nachieving the SDGs. With regard to the environmental \r\ndimension in particular, we need to act vigorously \r\nto prevent the threats posed by climate change and \r\nthe degradation of the environment. Reaching a \r\ncompromise on a balanced climate agreement would \r\nbode well for our collective efforts towards that aim. \r\nImplementing new, expanded models of scientific and \r\ntechnical cooperation among States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular through the establishment \r\nof a universal mechanism for technology transfer, is \r\nkey to bridging many gaps in sustainable development.\r\nI am convinced that by working hand in hand and \r\nimplementing our post-2015 development Goals, as \r\nwell as by jointly tackling existing challenges, we will \r\nensure that humankind successfully negotiates the path \r\nto progress.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of Ukraine for his statement.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The promotion of socioeconomic progress \r\nand prosperity for all countries and peoples lies at the \r\nvery core of our Organization’s mission. Forging a \r\nglobal partnership for development has been one of the \r\nmost significant achievements of the United Nations, \r\nand one of which we can all rightly be proud. \r\nFifteen years ago, it was the United Nations that \r\nmade it possible for the international community \r\nto unite to achieve the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). The joint efforts of Member States, \r\ninternational non-governmental organizations, business \r\nand academia all facilitated considerable progress \r\n15-29247 33/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nin providing access to health care and education for \r\nmillions of people around the world, fighting poverty \r\nand hunger and reducing maternal and child mortality. \r\nThat impressive success in attaining the \r\nMillenniium Development Goals is not, of course,a \r\nreason for complacency. Addressing global challenges \r\nsuch as eradicating extreme poverty, combating \r\ninequality, ensuring food security and healthy \r\nlifestyles, and shifting to more sustainable patterns of \r\nproduction and consumption will require additional \r\nfinancial, industrial and technological resources, \r\nbacked by an environment of constructive cooperation \r\nand mutual assistance and understanding. Many States \r\nstill cannot alone overcome development challenges, \r\nwhich are often accompanied by political instability, \r\ndiscrimination and other constraints, and they need \r\nlarge-scale international support. A good basis for \r\nforging such cooperation is provided by the outcome \r\nof the third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, held in July in Addis Ababa. \r\nRussia welcomes the adoption of the new global \r\nagenda for the period up to 2030. We stand ready to \r\nactively support its successful implementation at \r\nall levels. Guided by the principles of solidarity, our \r\ncountry will continue to make a significant contribution \r\nto building and strengthening the economic, \r\nintellectual, information, scientific and technological \r\ncapacities of partner countries. We will further \r\nfacilitate the effective utilization of the opportunities \r\nprovided by global markets for goods and services, \r\ndiversification of economic ties, active participation \r\nin integration processes. We will utilize the potential \r\nof women and youth and promote a child-friendly \r\nenvironment. Russia intends to use the achievements in \r\nscience and technology, especially in information and \r\ncommunication technologies, which are essential today \r\nfor accelerating global development and for bridging \r\nthe gap between developed and developing countries.\r\nRussia’s development assistance is consistently \r\naimed at resolving the most pressing challenges facing \r\ncountries in need. In our efforts, we neither lecture our \r\npartners on how they should build their lives nor try to \r\nimpose political models or values. Our main purpose \r\nis to eliminate poverty. One of the effective levers \r\nhere is, of course, lightening the debt burden. Within \r\nthe framework of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries \r\n(HIPC) Initiative, our country has written off over \r\n$20 billion of principal debt of African countries alone. \r\nRussia also contributes to reducing the debt burden of \r\nthe poorest countries, beyond the HIPC, by using debt-\r\nfor-aid swaps. \r\nOur country has been funding and implementing \r\naid projects in the fields of health, energy, education, \r\nfood security and infrastructure. We use the potential of \r\nthe United Nations development system organizations \r\nand humanitarian agencies, whose programmes do not \r\nhave conditions or political biases. Despite the current \r\nchallenging economic environment, Russia remains a \r\nresponsible and reliable partner of developing countries \r\nin addressing the most pressing challenges confronting \r\ntheir people, for example, combating the spread of HIV/\r\nAIDs, tuberculosis and malaria; maternal, infant and \r\nchild mortality; and the Ebola outbreak.\r\nOur international development assistance is \r\nincreasing. Last year it grew by more than 20 per \r\ncent. We provided more than $127 million through \r\nthe United Nations system alone, and our overall \r\nofficial development assistance, calculated according \r\nto the methodology of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, exceeded $875 million. \r\nWe will continue to increase our participation in \r\nmultilateral development assistance efforts. In doing so, \r\nwe base our efforts on the belief that helping countries \r\nin need to establish viable social and economic systems \r\nis an investment in global stability, an essential \r\nprecondition for building a more effective and resilient \r\ninternational system and a factor in the well-being and \r\nprosperity of humankind as a whole. \r\nWe often speak of the indivisibility of international \r\npeace and security. The new social and economic agenda \r\nshould also ensure understanding of the indivisibility \r\nof sustainable development. The international \r\ncommunity’s task is to work together to create external \r\nconditions conducive to socioeconomic progress. It is \r\nespecially important to ensure fair trade conditions and \r\ngreater access to cutting-edge technologies.\r\nRussia supports creating an equitable global \r\neconomic order and improving the regulation of \r\nglobal development. We call for action based on the \r\nuniversally recognized standards of international law \r\nand in the spirit of collective decision-making. We will \r\nincrease our cooperation with our partners in useful \r\nformats such as the Group of 20 and the BRICS group \r\nof Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, and \r\nwe are open to dialogue within the framework of other \r\ninformal structures, while, of course, respecting the \r\ncentral coordinating role of the United Nations. \r\n34/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nWe urge that more consistent efforts be made \r\nto reform organizational governance structures, \r\nparticularly of the International Monetary Fund and the \r\nWorld Bank, in order to strengthen developing countries’ \r\npositions. We believe it essential that the interaction of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil with the Bretton Woods institutions and the \r\nWorld Trade Organization be made more effective, \r\nin the interests of harmonizing the governance of our \r\nglobal monetary, financial and trade systems. We also \r\nsee an important role for the specialized United Nations \r\nagencies in those processes.\r\nRussia remains firmly committed to strengthening \r\nregional cooperation, including integration within \r\nEurasia. The recently established Eurasian Economic \r\nUnion is becoming a significant factor in the creation \r\nof conditions conducive to positive, sustained and long-\r\nterm economic growth in participating countries. In \r\ndeveloping it, we have always supported harmonizing \r\nit with various integration mechanisms in both East and \r\nWest.\r\nThe practice of taking unilateral coercive measures \r\nthat violate the Charter of the United Nations runs \r\ndirectly counter to the achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Such illegitimate and restrictive \r\nacts, which also undermine market principles in trade, \r\nfinance, technology and investment, should cease. That \r\nalso applies to lifting the embargo on Cuba and other \r\nsanctions imposed by bypassing the Security Council.\r\nWe consider finding a solution to the problem of \r\nclimate change to be a key precondition for achieving \r\nsustainable development. Our country is a world \r\nleader in the cumulative reduction of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions and compensates for increases in emissions in \r\nother countries and regions around the world. We have \r\nexceeded our commitments under the Kyoto Protocol \r\nby reducing our emissions to 31 per cent below their \r\n1990 levels. In the past 20 years, Russia’s energy sector \r\nemissions have fallen by 37 per cent, comparable to the \r\nfive-year emissions of all European Union countries \r\nand the three-year emissions of the United States.\r\nIn the context of the preparations for the Paris \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nwe have already announced the parameters of our \r\npotential commitments. In that regard, we would like \r\nto highlight the role of Russia’s northern forests, which \r\nabsorb around 600 million tons of carbon dioxide a \r\nyear. We will be adding that factor to those being taken \r\ninto account within the new agreement.\r\nWe propose that consideration be given to \r\nstrengthening our efforts in line with the operating \r\npractices of the United Nations Forum on Forests. \r\nWithin the framework of the Forum, we could discuss \r\nhow to create some kind of United Nations centre \r\nfor planning, protecting and restoring forests with a \r\nview to contributing to sustainable development and \r\ncontrolling climate change. In general, we believe it is \r\nessential that the decisions at the forthcoming session be \r\ncomprehensive, legally binding and universal. Climate \r\nchange is one of the most serious issues of our times, \r\nand the quality and effectiveness of any agreement \r\nshould have top priority.\r\nIn this, its seventieth year, the United Nations \r\nremains the main international forum for developing \r\nbasic principles and standards for socioeconomic, \r\nhumanitarian and environmental cooperation. \r\nMultilateral associations, including informal leadership \r\nalliances, should organize their efforts in line with the \r\nfundamental agreements achieved within this universal \r\nand indisputably legitimate Organization. We are ready \r\nto make a comprehensive contribution to increasing \r\nthe effectiveness of the work of the United Nations. \r\nI believe that together we can achieve effective and \r\ntimely implementation of our new agenda for global \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish):The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the State of Qatar.\r\nMr. Al-Attiyah (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould first like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nconvening this Summit, giving impetus to the post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nThe world has seen profound changes since the \r\nlaunch of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000. \r\nWhile many of those Goals have been met, many have \r\nnot. Today, the international community is committing \r\nto a new post-2015 development agenda, with a view to \r\nrealizing security, stability, prosperity and sustainable \r\ndevelopment for our countries and peoples, based \r\non lessons learned and our willingness to address \r\ncurrent and potential challenges and our shared and \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\r\nEnsuring the successful achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals requires that the \r\n15-29247 35/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\ninternational community tackle and find solutions to \r\nthe obstacles to sustainable development — whether \r\npolitical, structural or related to a lack of capacity — in \r\na practical and realistic way that takes into account \r\nthe basic needs of developing countries, particularly \r\nby assisting them in their efforts to deal with their \r\nincreasing marginalization in the global economy and \r\nto benefit from the economic and scientific potential \r\navailable today.\r\nNational policies should also reflect the \r\nhumanitarian and social aspects of development, \r\nprioritizing the development of strategies that meet \r\npeople’s basic needs and promote democracy and human \r\nrights, together with establishing rules for transparency \r\nand fighting corruption on the road to good governance. \r\nA commitment to the principles of the rule of law and \r\naccountability is essential to any development strategy, \r\nas was reaffirmed at the thirteenth United Nations \r\nCongress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, \r\nheld in Doha in April.\r\nPartnership and international cooperation are \r\ncrucial to sustainable development. They should be \r\nconducted on a basis of effective collaboration among \r\nnations, engaging especially with all sectors, public \r\nand private, and ensuring effective participation on the \r\npart of civil society and all other groups in society. \r\nDevelopment assistance from developed countries \r\nto developing and least developed countries should \r\nalso be provided without restrictions or politicization. \r\nDonor countries should do their utmost to enable \r\ncountries receiving aid to achieve development and \r\nestablish policies that will enable them to provide \r\nfor their people’s basic needs and break the cycles of \r\npoverty and dependence. They should also promote \r\npolicies directed at partnerships, investment and a true \r\nspirit of cooperation. \r\nI should note here that in recent years Qatar has \r\nprovided development assistance to many countries \r\naround the world dealing with economic and \r\nhumanitarian difficulties and natural disasters. In \r\n2014, this assistance amounted to more than 5.9 billion \r\nQatari riyals. That represents 0.76 per cent of our gross \r\ndomestic product, and it complemented the technical \r\nassistance we offered in the fields of education, health \r\nand other areas in accordance with the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2). \r\nIn this context, and proceeding from our keen \r\ninterest in raising the levels of education and providing \r\nequal educational opportunity to all, we have sought \r\nto duplicate our successful experiment in development \r\nassistance and international cooperation with a view \r\nto reducing the number of children deprived of basic \r\neducation all over the world, particularly those living in \r\nconflict zones. Six million children, including 600,000 \r\nchildren from fraternal Syria, have benefitted from the \r\nQatari initiative “Educate A Child”, launched in 2012 \r\nin conjunction with the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees.\r\nRealizing sustainable development at national, \r\nregional and international levels requires political \r\nwill, good faith and a true spirit of cooperation among \r\nnations. In this context, Qatar has been keen to assume \r\nits regional and international responsibilities with regard \r\nto attaining development objectives. In 2012, we hosted \r\nthe eighteenth Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nand we look forward to the Paris Conference. We hope \r\nthat an agreement that embodies our responsibilities in a \r\ncommon and differentiated manner will be reached and \r\nthat it will assist in building the capacity of developing \r\ncountries to adapt to climate change.\r\nOut of our conviction that sustainable development \r\ncannot be achieved without food security, His Highness \r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State \r\nof Qatar, launched a new initiative with regard to \r\ndrylands, desertification and drought all over the world. \r\nWe look forward to seeing the initiative’s positive \r\nimpact in 2015 and beyond. \r\nThe realization of all our objectives cannot be \r\nachieved in occupied territories. Therefore, redoubled \r\nefforts to assist the development process itself should \r\nbe made at the international level for the cause of peace. \r\nProceeding from our firm conviction on this point, \r\nwe have deployed great efforts in favour of young \r\npeople. We have encouraged their role in society and \r\nprovided an enabling environment that permits them to \r\nplay that role fully. In April 2015, in Doha, we held a \r\nyouth forum on crime prevention and criminal justice.\r\nQatar has made great strides in the sustainable \r\ndevelopment process. We are pleased that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda is in line with our objectives at \r\nthe national level and serves the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental targets that we seek to reach, particularly \r\nin the fields of security, health, education, culture and \r\nsports. \r\n36/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nQatar has taken great initiative to invest in its \r\ncitizens. We have laid out a comprehensive development \r\nplan aimed at transforming Qatar into a developed \r\ncountry capable of providing a high standard of living \r\nfor current and future generations.\r\nQatar takes a keen interest in the role of sport in \r\npromoting social cohesion and solidarity. We believe \r\nthat sport helps to teach the virtues of equality, tolerance \r\nand peace to the young generation and therefore has a \r\npositive impact. \r\nQatar also considers culture to be a key element \r\nfor development and an important factor in social \r\ncohesion, economic growth, poverty eradication, peace \r\nand security and human rights. We have therefore \r\ndeployed great efforts in the fields of cultural diversity, \r\nintercultural dialogue and development programmes in \r\nthe belief that culture is of great importance, be it for \r\neducation or the environment.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our commitment to doing \r\nour utmost to help the international community achieve \r\nsustainable development and express our willingness to \r\nprovide whatever material or technical support we can.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Maldives.\r\nMs. Maumoon (Maldives): This is a watershed \r\nmoment in human history. The hallowed halls of this \r\nbuilding have been abuzz with hope. The air is filled \r\nwith excitement. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) has captured the \r\nimagination of every child, every woman and every \r\nman, in every corner of the world. This Agenda has the \r\npotential to truly transform our world. There has never \r\nbeen a time more auspicious, a time when so many \r\nleaders gathered here. We must not squander it.\r\nIt was 15 years ago that we made the solemn pledge \r\nto free the world from poverty, disease, discrimination \r\nand environmental degradation (see resolution 55/2). \r\nFifteen years later, while our successes are many, so \r\nare our challenges. We may have reduced maternal \r\nmortality, but women are still paid 24 per cent less than \r\nmen. We may have reduced the rate of absolute poverty, \r\nyet people living in slum-like conditions are plentiful. \r\nWe may have protected and safeguarded some of our \r\nnatural environment, but carbon emissions keep on \r\nincreasing. There may still be a long way to go, but we \r\nhave the potential to achieve more.\r\nThe Maldives is fully committed to the achievement \r\nof the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with their 169 \r\ntargets. The Maldives is an Millennium Development \r\nGoal (MDGs) success story, and we are proud of it. \r\nWe are fortunate that the MDGs were formulated at a \r\ntime when the Maldives was experiencing phenomenal \r\ngrowth in the economic and social sectors. We \r\nincorporated the Goals into our development planning \r\nand aimed at achieving unprecedented development \r\ngains. \r\nTo sustain that trajectory of growth, the Maldives \r\nhas to overcome several challenges, which is a task \r\nthat will test our perseverance. Adjusting to the unique \r\nvulnerabilities of a small island developing State and \r\nthe different structural conditions of a middle-income \r\ncountry present challenges of unprecedented magnitude \r\nfor a country as small as the Maldives.\r\nIn spite of these challenges, we aim high and dream \r\nbig. Our vision of development is inclusive and holistic. \r\nA key strategy of President Yameen’s Government is \r\ninvesting in youth, including young women, through \r\nskills development and job creation. An ambitious new \r\nset of policies has been launched to enable women — one \r\nhalf of our population — to become productive partners \r\nin national development in whatever capacity they \r\nchoose for themselves, free from coercion or social \r\npressure.\r\nOur vision of development aims to make the \r\nMaldives a resilient, economically diverse, high-income \r\neconomy. We are aiming for economic transformation, \r\nincreased investment, and private-sector-led growth. \r\nWe have intensified our efforts to develop an investor-\r\nfriendly environment through key legislation and \r\nimproved macroeconomic stability.\r\nThe sustainable development of small island \r\ndeveloping States like the Maldives will never be \r\nrealized unless we make meaningful progress in the \r\nfight against climate change. Climate change threatens \r\nmodern civilization as we know it. It threatens the very \r\nexistence of many small island developing States. That \r\nis why we call on emitting countries to reduce their \r\nemissions. That is why we ask that the bold statements \r\nbe matched with legally binding commitments and \r\nactions in Paris later this year.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda is a beautifully drafted document. \r\nIt is an agenda of hope for the hopeless, an agenda to \r\nfight poverty and injustice and an agenda that we hope \r\nwill narrow the gap between the few millions that live \r\n15-29247 37/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nin prosperity and the billions that live in poverty. It is \r\nan agenda that promises to save my country and more \r\nthan 40 other low-lying coastal nations from climate \r\ncalamity; a calamity that, if allowed, would undoubtedly \r\nresult in the painful demise of those nations.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nYet the new Agenda is still only words on paper. \r\nIt is our duty to give meaning to those words and to \r\nrealize the true intention behind every Goal and every \r\ntarget. We can do that only through a commitment \r\nto implementation – backing words not only with \r\nfinancial support, but also with capacity-building, \r\ntechnology transfer, a data revolution, and meaningful \r\ntrade liberalization. Above all, we need an institutional \r\nframework that not only bolsters capacity, but takes in \r\naccount each country’s unique characteristics. It is now \r\nup to us to make the new Agenda a reality for the future \r\nof our people and our common home, planet Earth.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non the Minister for Environment and Water Resources \r\nof the Republic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Balakrishnan (Singapore): Today we celebrate \r\n15 years of significant progress in achieving the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) is built on a \r\nsolid foundation. The new development Agenda sets out \r\na commendable set of goals. It ref lects our most urgent \r\ncollective aspirations. It also gives us the tools to do \r\ndevelopment better. No single model of development \r\nwill be applicable to all countries. Countries will have \r\nto choose from the menu in the Agenda in order to find \r\nappropriate solutions for their own national priorities \r\nand unique circumstances. \r\nSmall States, especially small island developing \r\nStates, are vulnerable and feel the weight of global \r\nchallenges most intensely. Since more than half of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations are small island \r\ndeveloping States, we believe that our views, concerns \r\nand voices should be heard and should be reflected in \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nSingapore is both a small island developing State \r\nand a city-State. Since we became independent 50 \r\nyears ago, we have pursued sustainable development. \r\nDespite, and perhaps because of, our limited natural \r\nresources, we have had to achieve economic growth \r\nwhile preserving a good living environment for our \r\npeople. Although we have one of the world’s highest \r\npopulation densities, we have maintained our greenery \r\nand biodiversity, and we have enhanced our citizens’ \r\nquality of life. This year, we were deeply honoured \r\nthat our Singapore Botanic Gardens were inscribed as \r\na United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization World Heritage Site.\r\nWe believe that a dynamic economy, an inclusive \r\nsociety and a sustainable environment are not zero-\r\nsum trade-offs. They are mutually reinforcing and help \r\ncreate a virtuous cycle of development. We deem such \r\nan approach to be relevant to the 2030 Agenda. \r\nTwo factors are key to Singapore’s development: \r\nfirst, pragmatism in our governance and implementation, \r\nand secondly, partnerships, which have helped to build \r\ncapacity and develop our own human resources, as well \r\nas those of other developing countries that work with \r\nus. \r\nSingapore’s approach to policy-making and \r\ngovernance is based on pragmatism. We focus on \r\noutcomes, not ideologies. Our policies are based on \r\nwhat works — even if they are sometimes initially \r\nunpopular or unfashionable.\r\nTake the example of water. Our tiny island is only \r\n700 square kilometres in area. That severely restricts \r\nour ability to collect and store water. To diversify \r\nour water supply, we have had to expand our water \r\ncatchment areas so that the entire island is a water \r\ncatchment area. That has meant systematically cleaning \r\nup all our rivers, damming them wherever possible, and \r\nimproving our reservoirs. We use membrane technology \r\nextensively to turn even waste water into high-grade \r\nwater, which we call NEWater, for both industrial use \r\nand indirect potable use. Recycled water is now readily \r\naccepted as an integral source of water for our island.\r\nWe do not assume that any solution lasts forever. \r\nWe have to constantly adapt to changing realities. \r\nSingapore recently set up a Smart Nation Programme \r\nOffice. It works across the whole of Government \r\nusing technology to enhance the quality of life, create \r\nmore economic opportunities for all and strengthen \r\ncommunity bonds in the midst of great diversity. \r\nOne project, called Virtual Singapore, offers a \r\nthree-dimensional map of Singapore enriched with \r\nmultiple layers of data about buildings, land and the \r\nenvironment. Citizens, industry, Government and \r\nacademia can work together to monitor and tackle \r\nclimate change and other environmental challenges \r\npromptly and quickly. We even use Twitter and social \r\n38/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nmedia as a platform. For example, we have 200 smart \r\nsensors in our drains, and they automatically tweet if \r\nwater levels or f lood probabilities increase. They are, \r\nperhaps, the world’s first automatic tweeting drains!\r\nThe second factor in Singapore’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment journey has been collaborative \r\npartnerships. Given our lack of natural resources, we \r\nhave had to focus on developing our human capital. We \r\ninvest heavily in education so as to help our children \r\nachieve their full potential and to ensure that our \r\nworkforce remains constantly updated with the skills \r\nneeded for the future. As a f ledgling nation, Singapore \r\nbenefited from technical assistance and cooperation \r\nfrom the World Bank and United Nations agencies in \r\nthe early years of our nationhood. In the 1970s and \r\n1980s, training programmes with companies like Tata \r\nof India, Philips of Holland and Sanwa Bank of Japan \r\nhelped our workers improve their productivity and \r\nknowledge.\r\nTo play the scenario forward, we started the \r\nSingapore Cooperation Programme (SCP) in 1992. Each \r\nyear, we conduct about 300 courses for approximately \r\n7,000 officials from our fellow developing countries. \r\nWe welcomed our 100,000th SCP participant in April \r\nthis year. As a responsible global citizen, Singapore will \r\ncontinue to give back to the international community. \r\nToday, I am pleased to announce the launch of a new \r\nsustainable development programme under the SCP to \r\nsupport the 2030 Agenda. \r\nThrough that programme, Singapore will work \r\nwith our friends to develop capacity at three levels. \r\nFirst, at the senior leadership level, we will partner with \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme Global \r\nCentre for Public Service Excellence to jointly offer \r\nleadership programmes on good governance and public \r\nsector institutions. Secondly, at the policy level, we will \r\ncooperate with United Nations Settlements Programme, \r\nUN-Habitat, to roll out a multi-year programme on \r\nsustainable cities and urbanization for 100 cities in the \r\ndeveloping world. Thirdly, at the ground implementation \r\nlevel, we will work with partners like United Nations \r\nChildren’s Fund and UN-Water to provide training and \r\nconsultancy services focused on delivering practical \r\nlocal solutions in the areas of water and sanitation for \r\ncountries in need. \r\nThe unprecedented scale and ambition of the \r\n2030 Agenda require renewed commitment and \r\nenhanced partnerships among all stakeholders: States, \r\ninternational organizations, international financial \r\ninstitutions, the private sector and civil society. Many \r\nissues of sustainable development cannot be addressed \r\nunilaterally, \r\nFor example, transboundary haze from forest and \r\npeat-land fires in South-East Asia impairs the health \r\nof millions of people in the region. It compromises the \r\nsafety of aircraft and damages our regional economy. \r\nThe large quantities of carbon dioxide released set back \r\nour global efforts to mitigate climate change. The issue \r\nis directly linked to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly Goal 3, on ensuring \r\nhealthy lives and promoting well-being for all, and \r\nGoal 15, on the sustainable management of forests and \r\nthe prevention of land degradation and biodiversity \r\nloss. While individual countries have been tackling \r\nthe problem of transboundary haze, we need closer \r\nregional and international cooperation in order to apply \r\nlegal and commercial pressure on errant companies so \r\nas to prevent them from profiting from unsustainable \r\nland and forest clearing.\r\nThe late Mr. Albert Winsemius, the United Nations \r\neconomic adviser who helped to formulate Singapore’s \r\ndevelopment policies in the early decades of our \r\nindependence, once said that, as a foreigner, he could \r\nadvise but could not steer the ship for Singaporeans. \r\nThe national pride of ownership and the innate \r\nmotivation of our people are the biggest drivers of \r\nsustainable development. We applaud the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development for providing our people \r\nand Governments around the world with the necessary \r\ntools for taking the ownership of our future into our \r\nown hands.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq.\r\nMr. Al-Jaafari (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the people and Government of Iraq, I would like to \r\nconvey my congratulations to the Co-Chairs on their \r\nappointment to preside over this international Summit, \r\nwhich bears the hopes of humankind that we will be able \r\nto overcome the obstacles that prevent countries and \r\nStates from achieving sustainable development in an \r\nintegrated, comprehensive way. At the outset, I would \r\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho presented a comprehensive briefing on the United \r\nNations role for the next 15 years (see A/70/PV.4).\r\nI have travelled to United Nations Headquarters \r\nin New York from my country, Iraq. Ours is a country \r\n15-29247 39/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nthat has wished to promote democracy, free elections \r\nand the participation of all sectors of our country’s \r\npopulation, throughout all the various Governments we \r\nhave had since 2003. Elections have taken place under \r\nthe supervision of the United Nations.\r\nAs a result of the work of the Organization, our \r\nworld today is different from the world that existed \r\n70 years ago, when the United Nations was created. \r\nDespite that, a number of things have remained \r\nthe same. For example, from the point of view of \r\neconomics, the provision of basic services and well-\r\nbeing, there remains inequality among States. Those \r\ninequalities persist in developing countries and in the \r\nleast developed countries. Because of obstacles and \r\nconstraints, a number of States have not yet been able to \r\nachieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nDespite the efforts that Member States have made \r\nover the past 15 years, we continue to face a number of \r\nglobal challenges that require international efforts. They \r\nalso require vigorous partnerships backed by strong \r\ninternational financing and oversight mechanisms to \r\nmeasure progress. Among the security challenges at \r\nthe international level, war and terrorism have turned \r\npeaceful societies into societies where poverty, fear, \r\ndisease and other scourges rage. My country faces \r\nferocious transboundary terrorist attacks. Terrorists \r\ngenerally possess unprecedented financial capacities \r\nthat threaten international peace and security, thereby \r\nundermining the achievements of the MDGs. Thus they \r\nare an obstacle to the elimination and eradication of \r\nextreme poverty.\r\nMy country, Iraq, faces the horror of Daesh and \r\nother terrorist groups, and the international community \r\nmust take into account its special circumstances,  which \r\ndiffer from those of any other country. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the recognition in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) of the \r\nimportance of peace and security for activities and \r\nsustainable development projects in all countries. \r\nOf course, it is difficult to achieve any adopted \r\ndevelopment objectives, including the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), without peace and security. \r\nWe welcome the focus in the SDGs on refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons. Official development assistance can \r\nalso play a decisive role. It is crucial first and foremost \r\nfor building infrastructure projects, especially in those \r\ncountries that suffer from the scourge of conventional \r\nwarfare or global terrorism, which have undermined \r\nthe infrastructures of the cities and regions where they \r\nrage.\r\nWe welcome the bold objectives of the third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \r\nheld in Addis Ababa in July, which demonstrate a good \r\nunderstanding of the challenges facing sustainable \r\ndevelopment. My country believes that we must achieve \r\nthe objectives of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \r\nfinancing for development, especially for countries \r\nexperiencing very difficult security and environmental \r\nsituations that affect their ability to finance the \r\nrebuilding of State infrastructures destroyed by war, \r\nterrorism or natural disasters. \r\nWe must also take into account the refugee and \r\ndisplaced persons crises. \r\nStrengthening the institutions of the United \r\nNations, particularly the specialized agencies and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, is absolutely \r\nessential for the implementation of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nWe face transnational challenges. Given their \r\nnature, we need a more transparent, harmonious and \r\ncohesive world order, based on the individual — on \r\nhumans, on men and women — so as to ensure that we \r\npool all our efforts for the good of development at the \r\nglobal level. We must also have cohesive and integrated \r\ninstitutions that mobilize governmental efforts to meet \r\nthreats in a constructive and sustainable way.\r\nMy country considers trade and industry key \r\nengines for economic development. To achieve their \r\nintegration into a multilateral trade system, there is a \r\nneed to facilitate the membership of the least developed \r\ncountries and the developing States in the World Trade \r\nOrganization. At the same time, in order to diversify \r\nfinancial sources, we must work to strengthen and \r\nbolster national capacities through local industries and \r\nexports. \r\nInternational cooperation in technology transfers \r\nand the dissemination of information through social \r\nnetworks are among the most important tools for \r\nenabling average citizens to enjoy access to reliable \r\ninformation to fight extremism and terrorism and for \r\nstrengthening moderate religious thinking so as to \r\nfight the type of thinking that sows hatred throughout \r\nthe world and prevents countries from achieving \r\ntheir potential. We also wish to stress the importance \r\nof strengthening national capacities through fiscal \r\n40/41 15-29247\r\nA/70/PV.10 27/09/2015\r\nregimes that prevent tax evasion and strengthen and \r\nexpand the tax base.\r\nMy country believes that we have to allocate funds \r\nto implement the SDGs. Furthermore, monitoring \r\nthat implementation will require up-to-date digital \r\ndatabases. There is a need to bolster the capacities \r\nof developing States in the field of statistics by \r\nstrengthening their statistical bodies. That would \r\nenable them to gather the necessary data and all of the \r\nother necessary information. \r\nIraq welcomes the commitments of friendly States \r\nand donors, as well as the United Nations agencies, \r\nespecially the specialized agencies working in the field \r\nof humanitarian emergencies and disasters, by which \r\nI mean mainly the refugee crisis, and, of course, the \r\nattacks by Daesh, which have emptied our cities and \r\nadversely impacted the areas occupied by that terrorist \r\norganization. \r\nOur world faces a number of challenges. However, \r\nStates will have to prevail, with the United Nations at \r\nthe forefront, for it represents international legitimacy \r\nand protects all the peoples of the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia.\r\nMr. Al-Jubeir (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nWe meet today after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). That post-\r\n2015 development agenda is based on our experience in \r\nrealizing the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nand on a positive coalition among Governments, \r\ninternational organizations and specialized agencies \r\naimed at fighting poverty and hunger.\r\nMy country has made every possible effort in \r\nthat regard, based on our conviction of the utmost \r\nimportance of realizing the Millennium Development \r\nGoals starting from 2000 and into the reign of His \r\nMajesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud. We have \r\ndevoted continuous efforts to realizing the development \r\nobjectives and have continually increased allocations \r\nfor that purpose. We have been able to join the list of \r\ncountries that have registered a high rate of progress \r\nand development, and we have become one of the top \r\n20 contributors to development in the world, according \r\nto United Nations statistics. \r\nIt is extremely important to benefit from the lessons \r\nlearned in the work for the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which can assist us when we deploy our efforts \r\nin the post-2015 period for the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, with their social, economic and environmental \r\ndimensions. It is important to note that the realization \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals will remain \r\nextremely difficult for people under occupation. \r\nDevelopment cannot happen under occupation. We \r\nshould therefore reiterate the commitments made by \r\nthe international community in past conferences and \r\nsummits regarding sustainable and comprehensive \r\ndevelopment and the need to remove all hurdles \r\nstanding in the way of people living under occupation, \r\nparticularly in Palestine and other occupied Arab \r\nterritories.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, while participating \r\nin the Summit and associating itself with its objectives \r\nand goals, must make its position clear on certain \r\nparagraphs that may contradict, or run counter to, the \r\ntenets of Islamic law. The mention of sex in the text \r\nmeans to us exactly male and female. The mention of \r\nfamily means a family that consists of a married man \r\nand woman. Any deviations from those understandings \r\nwould force us to emphasize our sovereign right not to \r\nadopt any rules that run counter to Islamic law. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda is extremely \r\nimportant to us. We are committed to its realization for \r\nthe good of the entire world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the Vice Prime Minister of the State of Israel.\r\nMr. Shalom (Israel): The book of Ecclesiastes \r\nin the Bible says: “One generation goes and another \r\ngeneration comes; but the Earth endures forever.” We \r\nare gathered here today to ensure that generations to \r\ncome will inherit the promise of a prosperous planet \r\nand a sustainable world. \r\nWorking in partnership, the international \r\ncommunity has achieved extraordinary things. \r\nHowever, much work remains to be done. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\nmarks a new era of unprecedented global partnership. \r\nToday, we dedicate ourselves to combating the greatest \r\nglobal challenge, namely, the eradication of poverty in \r\nall its forms and dimensions.\r\nI have witnessed at first hand how determination \r\nand innovation can make the desert bloom and society \r\nf lourish. As a child, I lived with my family in Beersheva, \r\na dry and arid town in the middle of the Negev desert in \r\n15-29247 41/41\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.10\r\nIsrael. Today, Beersheva — the city of Abraham, Isaac \r\nand Jacob, the capital of the Negev — is a thriving \r\ncity, home to one of Israel’s leading universities and an \r\nemerging hub for sustainable technology.\r\nIt is hard to believe that from swamplands and \r\nsand dunes, Israel has become a source of innovation \r\nand creativity, known to many as the “start-up nation”. \r\nFrom energy and water to health and education, Israel \r\nhas developed cutting-edge technologies that turn salt \r\nwater into fresh water, convert waste into renewable \r\nenergy and detect preventable diseases with the touch \r\nof a button. \r\nIn Israel, we have learned to make every drop of \r\nwater count. Israel is a world leader in water technology, \r\nhome to one of biggest desalination facilities in the \r\nworld. We reuse 87 per cent of our waste water, ten \r\ntimes more than most other countries. Drip irrigation \r\nwas invented in Israel. We have exported that and other \r\ninnovative technologies to dozens of countries around \r\nthe globe.\r\nFor over 50 years, Israel’s Agency for International \r\nDevelopment Cooperation has deployed Israeli \r\nscientists, doctors, engineers and teachers all over the \r\nworld in order to share their expertise. To date, Israel \r\nhas trained over a quarter-million professionals from \r\n132 countries, helping them become agents of change \r\nin their own communities. Israel’s vision of sustainable \r\ndevelopment stems from the Jewish principle of “being \r\na light unto the nations”, which is well known in the \r\nBible. It is the moral and social obligation to share \r\nour knowledge and experience with others, so that \r\nno nation has to face the overwhelming challenges of \r\ndevelopment alone.\r\nAlbert Einstein once said: “All that is valuable \r\nin human society depends upon the opportunity for \r\ndevelopment accorded the individual.” As we move \r\nforward with our new Agenda, we must not lose sight \r\nof the individuals in our societies who have been denied \r\nan equal opportunity for development. Women and girls \r\nconstitute half of each of our societies, yet around the \r\nworld they continue to face deep inequalities in every \r\narea of life. We must create a new reality, one in which \r\nwomen and girls can participate on an equal footing \r\nwith men and boys in their economies, communities \r\nand families. Israel strongly believes that sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the eradication of poverty cannot \r\nbe achieved without gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment.\r\nYouth is also one of Israel’s top priorities. People \r\nunder the age of thirty account for more than half of \r\nthe world’s population, and most of them live in the \r\ndeveloping world. As we implement our new Agenda, \r\nwe must find ways to harness their talent and energy so \r\nthat they can become the masters of their own future. \r\nWe need all hands on deck to address the challenges we \r\nface. We must give a voice to the unheard and shine a \r\nspotlight on the unseen.\r\nThere are few regions of the world that can \r\nbenefit more from the new Agenda than the Middle \r\nEast. However, as long as the countries of the region \r\nchoose to invest in violence instead of in their own \r\npeople, there can be no hope for a better future. Israel’s \r\nsuccess story highlights the link among development, \r\nfree societies and prosperous nations. In contrast, the \r\nsituation in neighbouring countries highlights just the \r\nopposite, namely, that the lack of development leads to \r\nwar, poverty and oppression. Yesterday, the Palestinian \r\nForeign Minister stood here before the Assembly (see \r\nA/70/PV.9) and blamed Israel for all of the ills of their \r\nsociety. That might be surprising if it were not so \r\npredictable. After all, it is much easier to point fingers \r\nat others than to look at oneself in the mirror.\r\nI look forward to the day when Palestinian leaders \r\nplace the welfare of their people above warfare with \r\nIsrael, a day when they stop making false accusations \r\nand start making a real effort to improve the lives of \r\ntheir children and future generations. Only when that \r\nday comes will they be able to realize the Goals of \r\nthe new Agenda and enjoy the fruits of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Israel has repeatedly extended its hand \r\nin kinship and cooperation. Sadly, our hand has all \r\ntoo often been rejected. Today, once again, from this \r\nrostrum, I call on our Arab neighbours to forsake \r\ndestruction and despair and walk together on the path \r\nof prosperity and peace.\r\nTonight, the Jewish people will celebrate the \r\nholiday of Sukkot. On Sukkot, families come together \r\nto live in temporary dwellings in order to remember \r\nthe 40-year journey of the people of Israel through \r\nthe desert towards the Promised Land. As we begin \r\nour own journey towards the promise of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, let us come together so that generations \r\nto come will dwell in a sustainable, prosperous, and \r\npeaceful world.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.45 p.m.\r\n"
