It is a great honour to \r\nbe here to address the topic of sustainable development. \r\nIn many of our nations, especially the developed \r\ncountries, there is among our general population a \r\ngenuine compassion towards those in need. There is \r\na recognition of the grinding poverty that so many \r\nexperience every day around the world. And yet \r\nsometimes it is said that our efforts to combat poverty \r\nand disease do not and cannot work, that there are some \r\nplaces beyond hope and that certain people and regions \r\nare condemned to an endless cycle of suffering. Here, \r\ntoday, we put those myths to rest. \r\nToday we set aside the scepticism and lift up the \r\nhope that is available to us through collective action. \r\nBecause the world came together in an unprecedented \r\neffort, the global hunger rate has already been slashed. \r\nTens of millions more boys and girls are today in school. \r\nThe prevention and treatment of measles, malaria and \r\ntuberculosis have saved nearly 60 million lives. HIV/\r\nAIDS infections and deaths have plummeted. And \r\nmore than 1 billion people have lifted themselves up \r\nfrom extreme poverty— 1 billion! The entire world can \r\ntake enormous pride in those historic achievements. \r\nLet the sceptics and cynics know: development works. \r\nInvesting in public health works. We can break the cycle \r\nof poverty. People and nations can rise into prosperity.\r\nDespite the cruelties of our world and the ravages of \r\ndisease, millions of lives can be saved if we are focused \r\nand if we work together. Cynicism is our enemy. A \r\nbelief in the capacity and dignity of every individual \r\nand recognition that each of us can play a small part \r\nin lifting up people all around the world — that is the \r\nmessage that we are sending here today. Because of \r\nthe work of so many who are assembled here today, we \r\ncan point to past success; yet we are also here today \r\nbecause we understand that our work is nowhere near \r\ndone. We can take pride in what we have accomplished, \r\nbut we cannot be complacent.\r\nWhen 11 boys and girls die every single minute \r\nfrom preventable causes, we know we have more work \r\nto do. When hundreds of women die every single day \r\njust from having a baby, we know we have more work \r\nto do. When tens of millions of children are still not in \r\nschool, when hundreds of millions of people have no \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.11\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n11th plenary meeting\r\nSunday, 27 September 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nclean water and no toilets, we have so much more to do. \r\nRight now, some 800 million men, women and children \r\nare scraping by on less than $1.25 a day. Imagine that. \r\nGripped by the ache of an empty stomach, billions \r\nof our fellow human beings are at risk of dying from \r\ndiseases that we know how to prevent. Many children \r\nare just one mosquito bite away from death. That is a \r\nmoral outrage and a profound injustice. It is literally a \r\nmatter of life and death, and now the world must act. \r\nWe cannot leave people behind. \r\nAnd so today we commit ourselves to new \r\nSustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1), \r\nincluding our goal of ending extreme poverty in our \r\nworld. We do so understanding how difficult the task \r\nmay be. We suffer no illusions of the challenges ahead, \r\nbut we understand that this is something we must \r\ncommit ourselves to, because in doing so we recognize \r\nthat our most basic bond, our common humanity, \r\ncompels us to act. An impoverished child in a distant \r\nslum or in a neighbourhood not that far from here is \r\njust as equal, just as worthy, as any of our children, as \r\nany of us, as any Head of Government or leader in this \r\ngreat Hall. \r\nWe reaffirm that supporting development is not \r\ncharity, but is instead one of the smartest investments \r\nwe can make in our own future. After all, it is the lack \r\nof development, when people have no education and no \r\njobs and no hope, when they feel that their basic human \r\ndignity is being violated, that helps to fuel so much \r\nof the tension, the conflict and the instability in our \r\nworld. I profoundly believe that many of the conflicts, \r\nthe refugee crises and the military interventions over \r\nthe years might have been avoided if nations had truly \r\ninvested in the lives of their people and if the wealthiest \r\nnations on Earth were better partners in working with \r\nthose who are trying to lift themselves up.\r\nAs one of the founders of the United Nations, Ralph \r\nBunche, once said,\r\n“Peace is no mere matter of men fighting or not \r\nfighting. Peace, to have meaning … must be \r\ntranslated into bread or rice, shelter, health and \r\neducation.”\r\nI am here to say that in that work, the United States will \r\ncontinue to be the partner of the United Nations. Five \r\nyears ago, I pledged here (see A/65/PV.11) that America \r\nwould remain the global leader in development, and \r\nthe United States Government has in fact remained \r\nthe single largest donor of development assistance, \r\nincluding in global health. In times of crisis, from \r\nEbola to Syria, we have been the largest provider of \r\nhumanitarian aid. In times of disaster and crisis, the \r\nworld can count on the friendship and generosity of the \r\nAmerican people.\r\nThe question before us, though, as an international \r\ncommunity, is how do we meet the new goals that we \r\nhave set today. How can we do our work better? How \r\ncan we stretch our resources and our funding more \r\neffectively? How can donor countries be smarter, and \r\nrecipient countries do more with what they receive? \r\nWe have to learn from the past, to see where we \r\nsucceeded, so that we can duplicate that success and \r\nunderstand where we have fallen short and correct \r\nthose shortcomings. We start by understanding that the \r\nnext chapter of development cannot fall victim to the \r\nold divides between developed nations and developing \r\nones. Poverty and growing inequality exist in all of our \r\nnations, and all of our nations have work to do. That \r\nincludes us here in the United States. That is why, in \r\nthe wake of a terrible recession, my Administration has \r\nworked to keep millions of families from falling into \r\npoverty. That is why we have brought quality, affordable \r\nhealth care to more than 17 million Americans. Here \r\nin this country, the wealthiest nation on Earth, we are \r\nstill working every day to perfect our union, to be more \r\nequal and more just, and to treat the most vulnerable \r\nmembers of our society with value and concern.\r\nThat is why today I am committing the United \r\nStates to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nAs long as I am President, and well after I am done \r\nbeing President, I will keep fighting for the education, \r\nhousing, health care and jobs that reduce inequality and \r\ncreate opportunity here in the United States and around \r\nthe world, because that is not just the job of politicians; \r\nit is work for all of us.\r\nThe next chapter of development cannot just \r\nbe about what Governments spend. We have to get \r\nto work to harness the unprecedented resources of \r\nour interconnected world. In just a few short years, \r\nin the areas of health, food security and energy, my \r\nAdministration has committed and helped to mobilize \r\nmore than $100 billion to promote development and \r\nsave lives. Guided by the new consensus we reached \r\nin Addis Ababa, I am calling on others to join us. More \r\nGovernments, more institutions, more businesses, more \r\nphilanthropies, more non-governmental organizations, \r\nmore faith communities, more citizens — all of us must \r\nstep up with the will and resources and coordination \r\n15-29253 3/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nwe need to achieve our goals. This must be the work of \r\nthe world.\r\nAt the same time, the next chapter of development \r\nmust focus not simply on the dollars we spend, but on \r\nthe results we achieve. That demands new technologies \r\nand approaches, accountability, data and behavioural \r\nscience — an understanding that there are lessons that \r\nwe have learned and best practices for how people \r\nactually live, so that we can dramatically improve \r\noutcomes. It means breaking cycles of dependence by \r\nhelping people become more self-sufficient: not just \r\ngiving people fish, but teaching them how to fish. That \r\nis the purpose of development.\r\nRather than just sending food during \r\nfamine — although we have to do that to avert \r\nstarvation — we also have to bring new techniques, \r\nseeds and technologies to more farmers, so that they \r\ncan boost their yields and increase their incomes, \r\nfeed more people and lift countless millions out of \r\npoverty. Rather than just responding to outbreaks like \r\nEbola — although we have to do that, and we have \r\ndone so — let us also strengthen public-health systems \r\nand advance global health security, so as to prevent \r\nepidemics in the first place. As more countries take \r\nownership of their HIV/AIDS programmes, the United \r\nStates is setting two bold new goals. Over the next two \r\nyears, we will increase the number of people that our \r\nfunding reaches, so that nearly 13 million people with \r\nHIV/AIDS can get lifesaving treatment. We will invest \r\n$300 million to help achieve a 40 per cent reduction \r\nin new HIV infections among young women and girls \r\nin the hardest-hit areas of sub-Saharan Africa. And I \r\nbelieve we can do that in order to produce a first AIDS-\r\nfree generation.\r\nThe next chapter of development must also unleash \r\neconomic growth, not just for a few at the top, but \r\ninclusive, sustainable growth that lifts up the fortunes \r\nof the many. We know the ingredients for creating jobs \r\nand opportunity. They are not a secret. Let us embrace \r\nreforms that attract trade and investment to areas that \r\nare in need of investment and trade. Let us trade and \r\nbuild more together, making it easier for developing \r\ncountries to sell more of their goods around the world. \r\nLet us invest in our greatest resource, our people, and \r\ntheir education and skills. Let us invest in innovative \r\nentrepreneurs, the striving young people who embrace \r\nnew technology and are starting businesses; they can \r\nignite new industries that will change the world. I have \r\nmet young people on every continent, and they can lead \r\nthe way if we give them the tools they need.\r\nOur new development goals are ambitious. But \r\nthanks to the good work of many of the people in \r\nthis Hall, they are achievable if we work together \r\nand meet our responsibilities to each other. I believe \r\nthat. The progress of recent years gives us hope. We \r\nknow what works. We know how to do this. But these \r\ndays — perhaps because this is now my seventh year \r\nof addressing the General Assembly — I tend to be \r\nmore blunt. Along with the increasingly gray hair, I am \r\nbecoming more likely to speak my mind. I would like to \r\nbe indulged when I say that we will never achieve our \r\ngoals if we do not squarely confront several insidious \r\nthreats to the dignity and well-being of people around \r\nthe world. No matter how much hard work is done \r\nby development agencies, no matter how large the \r\ndonations and commitments made by donor countries, \r\nif we do not take care of some of the other elements of \r\ndevelopment, we will not meet the goals that we have \r\nset.\r\nNumber one, development is threatened by bad \r\ngovernance. Today, we affirm what we know to be true \r\nfrom decades of experience: development and economic \r\ngrowth that are truly sustainable and inclusive depend \r\non Governments and institutions that care about their \r\npeople, that are accountable and respect human rights \r\nand deliver justice for everybody, not just for some. \r\nIn the face of the corruption that siphons billions \r\naway from schools, hospitals and infrastructure into \r\nforeign bank accounts, Governments must embrace \r\ntransparency, openness and the rule of law. Combating \r\nillicit finance must be a global effort, because it is part \r\nof our development effort. Citizens and civil society \r\ngroups must be free to organize, speak their minds \r\nand work for progress, because that is how countries \r\ndevelop; that is how countries succeed.\r\nDevelopment is also threatened by inequality. That \r\nis a political debate that we are having in this country. \r\nI therefore want to be clear that it is not something \r\nto which the United States is immune. Every country \r\nhas to grapple with that issue. The wealthiest and \r\nmost powerful in our societies oftentimes like to keep \r\nthings as they are, and they often have disproportionate \r\npolitical influence. Inequality is when poor children \r\nare more likely to get sick and die than children in \r\nwealthier neighbourhoods, just across town; when \r\nrural families are more likely to go without clean water; \r\nwhen ethnic and religious minorities, people with \r\n4/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\ndisabilities or people of different sexual orientations are \r\ndiscriminated against or are unable to access education \r\nand opportunity. Inequality holds all of us back. \r\nTherefore, in all of our countries, we have to invest \r\nin interventions that allow us to reach more people, \r\nbecause no one should be left behind just because of \r\nwhere they live or what they look like.\r\nDevelopment is threatened by old attitudes, \r\nespecially those that deny rights and opportunity to \r\nwomen. In too many places, girls are less likely to be \r\nin school than boys. Globally, women are less likely \r\nto have a job than men and are more likely to live in \r\npoverty. I have said that before and I will keep repeating \r\nit: one of the best indicators of whether a country will \r\nsucceed is how it treats its women. When women have \r\nan education and when women have jobs, their children \r\nare more likely to get an education and their families \r\nare healthier and more prosperous. Their communities \r\nand countries do better, as well. Every nation, all of our \r\nnations, must invest in the education, health and skills \r\nof our women and girls.\r\nI have to say that I do not have patience for the \r\nexcuse: “Well, we have our own ways of doing things”. \r\nI — we — understand that there is a long tradition in \r\nevery society of discriminating against women. But \r\nthat is not an excuse for not taking a new path aimed at \r\nmaking sure that everyone in a society has opportunity.\r\nDevelopment is threatened if we do not recognize \r\nthe incredible dynamism and opportunity of today’s \r\nAfrica. Hundreds of millions of Africans still struggle \r\nin the face of grinding poverty, deadly disease and \r\ndaily assaults on their lives and dignity. However, I \r\nvisited Africa recently, and what I saw gave me hope \r\nand should, I know, give everyone here hope, because \r\nthat continent has made impressive gains in health and \r\neducation. It is one of the fastest-growing regions of the \r\nworld, with a rising middle class.\r\nDuring my travels, Africans, especially young \r\nAfricans, told me they did not want just aid, they want \r\ntrade. They want businesses. They want investment. \r\nI call on the world to join us as we mobilize billions \r\nof dollars in new trade, investment and development \r\nin Africa. That includes Power Africa, our initiative \r\naimed at bringing electricity and greater opportunity \r\nto more than 60 million African homes and businesses. \r\nIf we get Africa to fulfil its full potential, that will \r\nhelp the entire global economy. Everyone here will be \r\nhelped. It is not a zero-sum game. We are invested in \r\ntheir success.\r\nDevelopment is also threatened by war. That should \r\nbe a simple proposition, but it bears repeating. It is no \r\ncoincidence that half of the people living in extreme \r\npoverty around the world live in places aff licted by \r\nchronic violence and conflict. Today, some 60 million \r\nmen, women and children have been forced from their \r\nhomes, many by conflicts in the Middle East and in \r\nAfrica. Those are humanitarian crises and refugees \r\nthat we cannot ignore, and we have to deliver the urgent \r\naid that is needed right now. Those countries that can \r\nmust do more to accommodate refugees, recognizing \r\nthat those children are just like ours. But our efforts \r\nmust be matched by the hard work of diplomacy and \r\nreconciliation to end conflicts that so often tear \r\nsocieties apart. As I said earlier, war and conflict are \r\nmore likely to arise where we have bad governance, \r\nhigh inequality, discrimination against minority and \r\nethnic groups, and low educational levels. Those things \r\nare all related.\r\nFinally, development is threatened by climate \r\nchange. I want to thank the Secretary-General for the \r\nextraordinary leadership and work that he has done on \r\nthat issue. All of our countries will be affected by a \r\nchanging climate. But the world’s poorest people will \r\nbear the heaviest burden — from rising seas and more \r\nintense droughts to shortages of water and food. We will \r\nbe seeing climate-change refugees. As His Holiness \r\nPope Francis has rightly implored the world, the issue \r\nrepresents a moral calling.\r\nIn just two months, the world will have an \r\nopportunity to unite around a strong global climate \r\nagreement, for which we are going to be converging \r\nin Paris. With President Hollande’s leadership and the \r\nleadership of every world leader, we need to establish \r\nthe tools and financing to help developing nations \r\nembrace clean energy, adapt to climate change and \r\nprotect themselves against the false choice between \r\neconomic development and the best practices that can \r\nsave our planet. We can take joint action and at the same \r\ntime. The communities and lives of billions of people \r\ndepend on the work that we do.\r\nFuture generations of young people, watching today \r\nand tomorrow, will judge us, based on the choices that \r\nwe will make in the months and years ahead. One of \r\nthose young people is Eva Tolage. Eva lives in a village \r\nin Tanzania. She is 15 years of age, and she wrote me \r\n15-29253 5/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\na letter. Some of those here today know that I read 10 \r\nletters a day, mostly from inside the United States, but \r\nsometimes from around the world. I actually get 40,000 \r\na day, but I read 10.\r\nEva told me about her parents, farmers who are \r\nstruggling to provide for their seven children. This \r\nyoung, 15-year-old girl — a girl of the same age as my \r\ndaughters — dreams of going to college, but, with little \r\nfood to eat, she explained, it is hard for her sometimes \r\nto concentrate in school. She explained that her house \r\ndoes not have electricity, so it is hard for her to study \r\nat night.\r\nThat is not because her parents do not love her \r\nand do not have ambitions for her. Her father works \r\nincredibly hard in the fields in order to pay for her \r\neducation. But they just need a little help. “I will not let \r\nhim down. I will do whatever it takes”, she wrote in her \r\nletter. And then, knowing that we would be gathered at \r\nthis Summit to help lift up families like hers, she asked \r\nme a question that could be asked of all of our nations: \r\nWhat will they commit to doing? What will they do?\r\nThere are billions of boys and girls just like Eva. \r\nThey are just like our children. They have as much \r\ntalent and as much hope for the future. And they’re \r\nwilling to work hard, and their parents love them just \r\nas much as we love ours. Just by the accident of birth, \r\nit is so much more difficult for them to achieve their \r\ndreams as it is for our children. But in the eyes of God, \r\nthey are the same children. They are just as important.\r\nFor Eva and all those just trying to survive another \r\nday under conditions that many of us can barely imagine, \r\nit can sometimes seem as if the world is blind to their \r\nstruggles and their dreams. Today, I say to Eva and the \r\nhundreds of millions, billions, like her: “We see you. \r\nWe hear you.” We have read their letters. We commit \r\nourselves as nations, as one world, to the urgent work \r\nthat must be done, to standing with families like Eva’s \r\nas they work and strive for a better life, to ending the \r\ninjustice of extreme poverty, to upholding the inherent \r\ndignity of every human being, whatever it takes. We \r\ncannot let them down. With the Assembly’s help, we \r\nwill not.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the President of \r\nthe United States of America for his statement, strong \r\ncommitment and leadership.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United States \r\nof America, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Cartes Jara (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe adoption of the post-2015 development agenda \r\n(resolution 70/1) represents the beginning of an \r\nambitious road map for countries in their fight against \r\npoverty, with the aim of improving the quality of life \r\nof their inhabitants, particularly those who live in \r\nvulnerable situations.\r\nOne of our Government’s public-policy priorities has \r\nbeen the fight against poverty. We have made progress \r\ntowards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nwhich were adopted in 2000. Since the adoption of \r\nthose international commitments, we have managed, \r\nwith effort and perseverance, to reduce by more than \r\n50 per cent the proportion of the population living in \r\nextreme poverty. However, we will continue to push \r\nforward and focus our efforts on rural areas where the \r\ndifferences are even greater.\r\nOur main goal as a Government is to ensure food \r\nsecurity for our population in order to completely \r\neradicate malnutrition. Paraguay has taken decisive \r\nsteps to guarantee nutritional requirements, relying \r\non family agriculture, and to increase the necessary \r\nnutrition that girls and boys receive in order to ensure \r\nexcellent school performance and a healthy life. In that \r\nrespect, we have become one of the leading countries \r\nin the region, according to the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations (FAO). With the \r\nadoption of a recent law on school nutrition and sanitary \r\ncontrol, we have effected significant changes in public \r\npolicies, such as the establishment of nutrition-oriented \r\nbenefits and the promotion of family agriculture through \r\nsimplified procurement. The total State investment in \r\nthe school food programme has risen to $95 million, \r\nproviding breakfasts and afternoon snacks to 90 per \r\ncent of the student body and school lunches to 15 per \r\ncent. We are creating new awareness in our population, \r\nmainly among children. An example of that is the \r\ndrawing by a young eighth-grade student, Lucas Javier \r\nArmua, that I am sharing with the Assembly; Lucas was \r\nthe Paraguayan winner of the regional contest “Feeding \r\nthe world and caring for the Earth”, organized by FAO.\r\nWe are aware that there is a direct link between \r\neducation and development. In that context, we have \r\nachieved the universalization and consolidation of \r\n6/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nprimary-school education, and our country will soon \r\nachieve the goal of 100 per cent full coverage. In 2014, \r\nyouth literacy rates were already above 98 per cent, \r\nand in that sense, we are just one step from universal \r\nliteracy, with equity for gender, area of residence and \r\neconomic condition. Significant progress can also be \r\nobserved in the school enrolment and the reduction \r\nin the gender gap. In that connection, I would like to \r\npoint out the increase in women’s participation from 8 \r\nto 17 per cent in the national leadership within the past \r\n15 years.\r\nWith regard to under-5 child mortality, by \r\nmaintaining the downward trend in recent periods, we \r\nwill achieve the goals we have set for ourselves. By the \r\nend of 2013, assisted birth deliveries in health service \r\ncentres increased to 96.2 per cent on average at the \r\ncountry level. Since June 2014, our Government, with \r\nthe support of UNICEF, has been carrying out a project \r\nfor zero preventable deaths. In that context, maternal \r\ndeaths were reduced by 33.6 per cent, and neonatal \r\ndeaths were reduced to 2 per cent in the first year of \r\nour work through the ongoing training of public-health \r\nstaff.\r\nWe are pleased to announce that Paraguay has \r\nachieved the Millennium Development Goals related \r\nto access to systems of drinking water supply and \r\nsanitation.\r\nThe Paraguayan financial system has been \r\nstrengthened in recent years and now maintains \r\nadequate solvency and capitalization ratios. There has \r\nbeen a gradual increase in the access to credit for small \r\nfarmers. The success of Paraguay’s monetary policies \r\nhas resulted in the lowest levels of inflation in Latin \r\nAmerica. That factor, among others, allows Paraguay \r\nto have one of the fastest growing gross domestic \r\nproducts in the region. According to a 2014 Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nreport, Paraguay ranks second among Latin American \r\ncountries in terms of the return on direct foreign \r\ninvestment.\r\nMeeting the Millennium Development Goals \r\nhas contributed to the improved living conditions \r\nenjoyed by the inhabitants of our country and our \r\nfuture generations. We know that we still have much \r\nto do, but it is good to see that we are heading in the \r\nright direction. Today, our Government would like \r\nto affirm our commitment to the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) with the \r\nprimary objective of ensuring the welfare of the entire \r\npopulation.\r\nSolidarity and international cooperation are \r\nessential if all nations of the world are to achieve \r\nharmonious, peaceful, respectful, fair and inclusive \r\ncoexistence. We know that the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, adopted at this Summit, are ambitious and pose \r\na challenge to the international community. But if \r\nwe achieve adequate consensus at the international, \r\nregional and national political levels, the Goals are \r\nfully achievable. The implementation and permanence \r\nof public policies, as well as the allocation of sufficient \r\nresources in a rational and timely manner, are essential. \r\nIn that context, we must work to achieve an effective \r\ninvestment of public funds by establishing transparent \r\nimplementation and accountability mechanisms.\r\nWe must not ignore the fervent cry of our Mother \r\nEarth to preserve the environment. Climate change is a \r\nglobal issue and a central challenge to all Governments \r\nand inhabitants of the world.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay welcomes the holding of \r\nthis Sustainable Development Summit, which coincides \r\nwith the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nOne of the key points in the 2030 Agenda deals with \r\nthe case of countries confronting special conditions. In \r\nthat regard, the international community has pledged to \r\ntake concrete actions to overcome the obstacles facing \r\nland-locked developing countries. The Agenda will be \r\ntransformative for those countries to the extent that their \r\nspecific needs and challenges are incorporated into \r\nthe programmes of work of the relevant international \r\norganizations, international financial institutions and, \r\nnot least, those of the transit countries. We are also \r\nconvinced that new possibilities can emerge from the \r\ndifficulties we are facing — particularly in the areas of \r\ninfrastructure, logistics and integration. It also pleases \r\nme to mention that at the General Assembly of the \r\nOrganization of American States, held in my country in \r\n2014, members approved the Asunción declaration on \r\ndevelopment with social inclusion, which is currently \r\nbeing implemented.\r\nThe Government of Paraguay is committed \r\nto implementing the new post-2015 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda and will comply with its \r\nprocedures for monitoring and review at the national, \r\nregional and global levels, which will help it to be \r\ninclusive, transparent, rigorous and based on reliable \r\nand timely information. It is in times of great \r\n15-29253 7/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nchallenges that we need to embrace more than ever our \r\nfundamental values and principles and never forget that \r\nthe raison d’être of Governments must be the dignity of \r\nthe people, enshrining their well-belling as the ultimate \r\ngoal of all of our efforts. In that process, we honour our \r\npeople and pave the way for generations to come.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay for his statement.\r\nMr. Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the French Republic.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Hollande (spoke in French): What the \r\ninternational community has done today in adopting \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution A/70/1) is undoubtedly one of the most \r\ndecisive acts in the history of the United Nations, for \r\nwe have made a commitment to future generations to \r\nset the fight against poverty, human development and \r\nprotecting the planet as our one indivisible goal. The \r\nroad to the adoption of the new Agenda has been a long \r\none. Twenty-eight years ago, the World Commission \r\non Environment and Development entrusted Ms. Gro \r\nHarlem Brundtland with the preparation of a report \r\nentitled “Our Common Future”, and with it, sustainable \r\ndevelopment first became an issue. Five years later, \r\nwe held the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in Rio de Janeiro, which proclaimed the \r\ncommitments that the world was supposed to undertake \r\nbut that, unfortunately, were not, for too long, backed \r\nup by actions.\r\nIt has therefore taken 28 years for us to finally \r\nadopt together, here and now, the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. It has taken 28 years for this notion \r\nof sustainable development to take shape in the form \r\nof a concrete and universal road map, with goals and \r\ntargets. It has taken 28 years of perseverance to end the \r\ndivisions that sometimes arise among us, to overcome \r\nour lack of foresight and our narrow self-interest and \r\nto ensure that as 193 nations, we — from all corners \r\nof the Earth — can arrive at consensus on these Goals. \r\nI would like to commend not only the United Nations, \r\nbut also the States, the Governments and, especially, \r\nthe non-governmental organizations and civil-society \r\norganizations that contributed to that awakening. \r\nThey exerted the necessary pressure in order for us to \r\nreach this point. Instead of furnishing proclamations, \r\ndeclarations and mantras, they have provided us with \r\nGoals contained within an Agenda and a road map.\r\nWhat is at stake is the fight against inequalities \r\non a global scale. In 2015, 1 billion human beings \r\ncontinue to live on less than $1 a day. In the world, \r\none in nine people suffer from hunger, and 250 million \r\nchildren — undoubtedly even more than that — do not \r\nknow how to read or write. Entire regions are suffering \r\nnot only from the effects of desertification but also from \r\ndisease, which has led to an ever-increasing number \r\nof refugees, and that at a time when we are already \r\ntalking a great deal about refugees, because of their \r\ngreat number coming from the Middle East or Africa \r\nand entering into Europe.\r\nI would like to recall today what for many \r\nrepresentatives is self-evident: 80 per cent of \r\nrefugees — whether they are refugees because of \r\nclimate change, war or hunger — are being received \r\nin the countries of the South. The South is showing \r\nits solidarity with the South. Frequently, the countries \r\nwith the fewest resources are the ones who are \r\naccommodating the poorest refugees. That is the reason \r\nthat we have to act, why we have to decide. The adoption \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals is not simply a \r\nquestion of wanting to live better; for many, those who \r\nare affected by poverty or climate change, the stakes \r\nare higher: life or death. What we have decided does \r\nnot concern quality of life issues but life itself. That \r\nis why the 2030 Agenda is a monumental response to \r\nwhat is for us ultimately the main issue at stake for the \r\ncohesion of our planet. We have chosen 17 Goals, but \r\nthere are three indivisible priorities. The first priority \r\nconcerns the protection of the climate, which will be \r\nthe central theme at the Conference of the Parties in \r\nParis that France has undertaken the responsibility of \r\nhosting.\r\nI had lunch with the main Heads of State and \r\nGovernment of the largest continents. We wanted to \r\ndetermine whether or not an agreement on climate \r\nchange was possible. There was no Head of State or \r\nGovernment who said that he was against an agreement. \r\nI could swiftly conclude, therefore, that we are sure to \r\nmeet with success. That is not just my opinion alone. An \r\nagreement is always possible. The question being put to \r\nus is, what kind of agreement? How far-reaching should \r\nit be? How many commitments should it contain?\r\n8/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nIn Paris, we will not be signing a text simply \r\nbecause we were not able to do so in Copenhagen in \r\n2009. No, the text we sign in Paris will be one that we \r\nwill honour for decades to come. It will be an agreement \r\naffecting all countries in various situations. It will be \r\nlegally binding and ensure that regularly every five \r\nyears we will be able to evaluate and measure what \r\nhas or has not been achieved. The aim is to prevent the \r\nplanet from heating up by more than 2°C by the end of \r\nthe century. For many countries, if the planet warms by \r\nmore than 2°C, it will not just be a target that has not \r\nbeen achieved or a Goal that has been missed. No, it \r\nwill quite simply mean that the countries we refer to as \r\nsmall island developing States will disappear by the end \r\nof the century. For many other countries, it will mean \r\nthat desertification and deforestation will continue, and \r\ntheir people will, as a result, not be able to live as they \r\ndo today.\r\nIt is for that reason that, in Paris, we will need to \r\nmake commitments through contributions. I call on \r\nall countries to make their contributions, so that we \r\ncan bring together all of the commitments and ensure \r\nthat there is an increase of only 2°C by the end of the \r\ncentury. We will need to ensure that a decision is taken \r\non establishing a carbon tax and that all economic \r\nstakeholders adapt their behaviour and their investments \r\nin line with the tax. We will also need to address the \r\nissue of financing, and that is a major issue. Are we, \r\nas developed countries, simply feeling remorse about \r\nthe way in which we have used our natural resources? \r\nAre we trying to ensure that developing countries do \r\nnot suffer the same disastrous fate? Or rather, are we \r\ngoing to raise funding in order to allow some countries \r\nto skip a step, ensure their energy transition, adapt their \r\ntechnology and make a technological leap forward? \r\nThat would help them achieve more growth at home \r\nand contribute fewer greenhouse gas emissions across \r\nthe planet.\r\nWe are familiar with the figures. They were \r\nestablished in Copenhagen in 2009. We need to \r\nfind $100 billion a year to ensure that the necessary \r\nchanges occur and that we set that goal as part of our \r\ndevelopment policy. I would urge each country to exert \r\nas much pressure as possible, so that, in Paris, and at \r\nthe annual meetings of the World Bank Group and the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund in Lima next month, we \r\ncan achieve the target of $100 billion to ensure energy \r\ntransition and combat global warming. As we set that \r\nobjective as a priority, it must, at the same time, be \r\nconsistent and compatible with combatting poverty. \r\nThe fight against hunger, disease and difficult access \r\nto water and natural resources is part of the same fight. \r\nThe funding for energy transition and the financing \r\nthat we mobilize during the Paris Conference will also \r\nenable us to combat poverty and take action to promote \r\ngrowth and development.\r\nI also know that we will have to take specific \r\nactions to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. \r\nFrance is ranked as the world’s second largest health-\r\ncare donor, of which it is very proud. During the Ebola \r\noutbreak, when Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea were \r\naffected by the disease, it was because of international \r\naction and humanitarian organizations that we were \r\nable to eliminate that scourge and, today, we can be \r\nproud of and commend those countries that made the \r\nefforts needed to make that a reality. Ebola has been \r\nvanquished in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. We \r\nare therefore able to act and we must act.\r\nThe third fight for us is also linked to the previous \r\nones. We do not just want to live on a planet whose \r\ntemperature is no longer rising. We do not just want \r\nthere to be fewer inequalities. We want human beings \r\nto enjoy their rights. We want women to be able to \r\ncontribute to wealth creation, we want fundamental \r\nfreedoms to be recognized, we want the fight against \r\ncorruption to be undertaken and conflicts to be resolved.\r\nAll of those desires are outlined in the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We are not just talking about \r\nreducing inequalities. We are talking about living \r\ndifferently in this world. In order to implement those \r\npolicies, I have already said that we will need resources. \r\nI mentioned the financing needed to combat climate \r\nchange, but just because we are going to do more in \r\nthe area of climate financing does not mean that we \r\nshould do less for development financing. That, too, \r\nis extremely important. At this session of the General \r\nAssembly, we reached an agreement on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The Paris Conference on Climate \r\nChange will soon be held. They are both linked, one to \r\nanother, but one does not replace the other. That is why \r\nwe need to increase official development assistance.\r\nToday, we will ask all those who accept the idea of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and the new Agenda \r\nto increase their development contributions. France \r\nalways wants to lead the way and set the example, even \r\nif that may be demanding at times. France will host the \r\nConference on Climate Change, and it will also call for \r\n15-29253 9/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nthe highest of standards to be met. It is for that reason \r\nthat we have decided to earmark €4 billion more for \r\nofficial development assistance from 2020 onwards.\r\nI have also decided to carry out a far-reaching reform \r\nof our official development assistance programme with \r\nthe French Development Agency and the Caisse des \r\nDépôts, a large French financial institution. We will \r\nhave the largest development bank in Europe, so that we \r\ncan honour our commitments and not just quote figures \r\nthat are never respected. We, too, in France, along \r\nwith the other countries in the Eurozone, have sought \r\nto establish a tax on financial transactions. That tax \r\nshould be introduced at the beginning of 2017. We will \r\ndo our utmost to ensure that that occurs. A percentage of \r\nthe tax will be earmarked for combatting inequalities, \r\nglobal warming and large-scale pandemics. That is a \r\ncommitment I am making before the Assembly today.\r\nWe know our enemies. They are known as \r\nindifference, carelessness and indolence. They can \r\nalso be referred to as passive acceptance. There is the \r\nidea that there will always be a miracle solution; that \r\nthe international community will always come to an \r\nagrement; that there will be a piece of technology or an \r\ninvention that will keep us from having to shoulder our \r\nresponsibilities. No, it is going to be men and women \r\nwho decide their future and their destiny. Today, \r\nafter 28 years, we have managed to agree to adopt the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and an Agenda for \r\nthem. My duty, in December, is to ensure that we can all \r\nagree on how to combat climate change and guarantee \r\nlife on our planet for years to come.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the President of the \r\nFrench Republic for his statement.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Solís Rivera (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\nwith great enthusiasm that I have come to this historic \r\nSummit to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). I represent a nation that, \r\nfor many years, has worked tirelessly to achieve the \r\ndream of becoming a sustainable society The goals that \r\nwe are committing to today are grand and ambitious, \r\nas they should be. We should dream big and aim high. \r\nI am convinced that the decisions we have taken today, \r\nand others that we will take in the future, have the \r\npotential to turn many of our dreams — the dreams of \r\nthe Assembly — into realities. As we are on the cusp \r\nof implementing this Agenda, I would like to highlight \r\nsome of the achievements as well as the challenges that \r\nstill remain for us in Costa Rica.\r\nThe fight for equality in Costa Rica dates back to \r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century. That dream \r\nbegan to become a reality in 1847, when girls and boys \r\nwere assured the right of access to our free education \r\nsystem. In 1950, for the first time, women exercised \r\ntheir right to vote in our country, and my predecessor, \r\nLaura Chinchilla Miranda, became the first female \r\nPresident of Costa Rica. Moreover, only a few weeks \r\nago, an illustrious former Costa Rican Judge of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, Ms. Elizabeth Odio, was \r\nelected to the presidency of the Inter-American Court of \r\nHuman Rights. Currently, Costa Rica is leading efforts \r\non behalf of those who believe the time has come for a \r\nwoman to fill the position of Secretary-General.\r\nWith this Agenda, we reaffirm that the philosophy \r\nof “Yes we can!” and commit ourselves to providing \r\nequal access for women and girls to inclusive, equitable \r\nand quality education, economic resources and political \r\nparticipation and to the same opportunities as men with \r\nrespect to employment, leadership and decision-making \r\nat every level. We are convinced that the shared social \r\nresponsibility of men and women constitutes an \r\nessential step in empowering women.\r\nOur commitment to technology also dates back \r\nto the nineteenth century. In 1884, two years after \r\nelectricity lit up New York City, San José, our capital, \r\nfollowed suit. In 1940, the Costa Rican Institute of \r\nElectricity was founded, and since then it has developed \r\na wide range of sources of renewable energy. Today, the \r\nsame utility connects over 99 per cent of the national \r\nterritory to the grid and ensures a dependable supply of \r\nelectricity at competitive prices in the region.\r\nFor more than 200 days, with very few exceptions, \r\nCosta Rica has been generating all of its electric power \r\nwithout producing any hydrocarbons. In that regard, we \r\nhave realized the mantra “Yes we can!”, and we now \r\nrenew our commitment to universal access, based on \r\nprinciples of solidarity, to an affordable, reliable and \r\nsustainable energy supply.\r\n10/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nAchieving sustainability is therefore not a rhetorical \r\nexercise in my country, nor need it be in the rest of \r\nthe world. In 2002, the first moratorium on oil drilling \r\nwas announced in Costa Rica. My Government has \r\nextended it to 2021.\r\nToday, we are also taking measures to renew our \r\ncommitment to becoming a carbon-neutral country by \r\n2021. We understand that sustainability covers a broad \r\nrange of activities, including public transportation, \r\norganic and sustainable agriculture and ecotourism, \r\nwhich has been one of my country’s main achievements.\r\nWe have also decided that “Yes, we can!” will \r\napply to one of the biggest challenges of the 2030 \r\nAgenda, which is ensuring sustainable consumption \r\nand production patterns.\r\nWe say “Yes we can!” in relation to promoting \r\npeaceful, just and inclusive societies, free from fear \r\nand violence. The 2030 Agenda clearly states in its \r\npreamble: “There can be no sustainable development \r\nwithout peace and no peace without sustainable \r\ndevelopment”.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reflect \r\non how we will implement the 2030 Agenda. We in \r\nCosta Rica, as we have said here many times before, \r\nbelieve that disarmament is a mechanism that allows \r\nus to redirect significant resources to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Betting on disarmament is synonymous \r\nwith betting on peace and a culture of peace and \r\nnon-violence. The equivalent of $1.776 trillion was \r\nspent worldwide on military spending in 2014. The five \r\npermanent members of the Security Council are among \r\nthe top six countries in terms of military spending, and \r\nthey are the largest producers and exporters of weapons \r\nin the world. We call on them as brothers — but we also \r\ncall on them categorically — to redirect that spending \r\ntowards sustainable development. I assure them that \r\nthere is no better way of ensuring the safety of their own \r\ncountries than by ensuring the sustainable development \r\nof the whole world.\r\nCosta Rica is enthusiastically preparing for the \r\nnational implementation of the 2030 Agenda by \r\nincorporating it into our national planning at all levels. \r\nTo fulfil the need for coordination, we are relying on the \r\nNational Council on Sustainable Development, which \r\nin its institutional management has a f luent relationship \r\nwith public and private stakeholders. We have studied \r\nand learned from the experiences and best practices of \r\nother countries in this field.\r\nCosta Rica is a middle-income country, as are many \r\nothers represented here, and as such have realized that, \r\ndespite our many advances in various strategic areas, we \r\nhave not been able to move forward as fast as necessary \r\nor in all the areas that would ensure the well-being of \r\nour entire population. I reiterate my country’s appeal \r\nfor the Organization to make progress in establishing \r\nan action plan for cooperation with middle-income \r\ncountries. Over 70 per cent of the people living in \r\npoverty in the world live in what are inappropriately \r\ncalled middle-income countries — a designation that \r\nserves as an excuse for other States to stop cooperating \r\nwith them — where the challenge of inequality \r\ncontinues and poor income distribution is the first issue \r\nto be addressed. We therefore call for better internal \r\ncoordination and the necessary institutional framework \r\nwithin the United Nations to support our efforts.\r\nCosta Rica also calls for the development of an \r\nindex to measure the multidimensional nature of \r\npoverty, one that includes criteria beyond per capita \r\nincome. The global challenge to end poverty in all its \r\nforms requires the proper instruments, and Costa Rica \r\nis committed to their design and implementation. The \r\nneed for them was supported by various delegations a \r\nshort while ago, in a high-level meeting organized by \r\nmy country.\r\nThose proposals for means of implementation \r\nshould f low from the agreements already reached at \r\nthe third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment. They should be central pillars for future \r\ndiscussions and should serve in particular as the basis \r\nfor the strong commitments on climate change that I \r\nhope we will make in Paris in December. I would like \r\nto congratulate President François Hollande on his \r\nleadership in that process, and I welcome President \r\nBarack Obama’s decision to attend in Paris, after \r\nbravely launching his ambitious clean energy plan in \r\nAugust. It is our responsibility to arrive at a major, \r\nrigorous agreement in Paris that will genuinely force \r\nthe world to focus its efforts once and for all on the \r\nconservation and preservation of our species. That is \r\ncrucial and cannot be put off.\r\nCosta Rica has marked out a pathway in which \r\ndisarmament is critical to achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment. On 1 December 1948, the day the Costa \r\nRican army was abolished, the founder of our Second \r\nRepublic, José Figueres Ferrer, said,\r\n15-29253 11/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\n“To the home of Washington, Lincoln, Bolívar \r\nand Martí, today we say: Oh, America, other \r\npeoples, who are your children too, offer you their \r\ngreatness. Little Costa Rica, now and forever, offers \r\nyou its heart and its love of civility and democracy.”\r\nSixty-seven years later, as we mark the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations and \r\nmake our commitment to the 2030 Agenda, little Costa \r\nRica would now like, once again, to offer, this time to \r\nthe whole world, its heart, its love and its commitment \r\nto democracy and freedom as a sustainable model that \r\nfosters solidarity, education, inclusivity, transparency, \r\njustice and peace.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of Costa \r\nRica for his statement.\r\nMr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Mahama: I bring the Assembly warm \r\ngreetings from the good people of Ghana, undoubtedly \r\nthe world’s friendliest country.\r\nThe adoption on Friday of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which \r\nincludes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is \r\na major re-dedication of the world to its commitment \r\nto fighting the growing inequality, wiping out extreme \r\npoverty and tackling the issues of climate change over \r\nthe next 15 years. The adoption of the new Goals at \r\na moment when the United Nations is turning 70 can \r\nprovide some hope to the young people of the world \r\nthat, after decades of existence, the Organization is still \r\nalive to the challenges of today.\r\nWhat we have adopted and now refer to simply as the \r\nSDGs is perhaps the most ambitious transformational \r\ndevelopment agenda attempted in the history of \r\nthe United Nations. We must tackle the challenges \r\nidentified in the 17 Goals as a matter of urgency, and we \r\ncan also seize the opportunity offered by the adoption \r\nof the SDGs to tackle the unfinished business of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs).\r\nIn pursuing the SDGs, it is important that we define \r\na new paradigm of development. The current high \r\nconsumption of the wasteful societies that we classify \r\nas developed cannot serve as the model for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. If the attractions of the big cities of the \r\nso-called developed world, such as shopping malls \r\nbursting at the seams with all kinds of consumer goods, \r\nglitzy neon lighting and fast food franchises, represent \r\nthe standard for classification as developed, we will \r\nneed two more planets the size of our Earth to maintain \r\nand sustain the human race. The world’s resources \r\nare not infinite. If we are to attain the objective of a \r\nsustainable consumption and production pattern, as \r\nprovided for under Goal 12, we will have to review the \r\nrelationship between labour, production and capital.\r\nThe path to sustainable development for Ghana \r\nand many other African countries has been a difficult \r\none. In the main, we are still producers of primary \r\ncommodities, while secondary and tertiary processing \r\nis done in the developed world and finished goods are \r\nexported back to us. If the teeming youth of Africa are \r\nto find jobs at home and stop attempting the dangerous \r\ncrossing of the Mediterranean to enter the greener \r\npastures of Europe, we must review the role that Africa \r\nplays in world production. A significant portion of \r\nprocessing and value addition must relocate to our \r\ncontinent.\r\nI stand here at the United Nations and commit to \r\nthe people of Ghana that I will continue to aggressively \r\nand dynamically implement our country’s agenda for \r\ntransformation within the framework of the newly \r\nadopted SDGs, in order to build a life of dignity \r\nthat ensures that no one is left behind. Through the \r\nimplementation of the agenda for transformation \r\ndeveloped by our national development planning \r\ncommission, we aim to diversify production and \r\nexports, be more competitive in international markets, \r\nincrease the productivity of all our resource inputs \r\nand upgrade technologies so as to make our much-\r\nanticipated leap out of poverty.\r\nThe African Union’s Agenda 2063 makes a strong \r\ncase for integrating our economies on the continent so \r\nas to accelerate the pace of transformative change. In \r\norder to achieve that, we have to invest in our human \r\ncapital through education and health care, accelerate \r\ninfrastructure development so as to link the African \r\neconomies and address inequalities, while building \r\nmeaningful relationships with the private sector. A \r\nfocus on Goals 2 and 7 of the SDGs will provide Africa \r\nwith the impetus needed to ensure economic growth \r\nand transformation.\r\n12/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nThe “green revolution” has never really taken off \r\nin Africa. And yet Africa has a significant proportion \r\nof the world’s remaining arable lands. With improved \r\nseeds, fertilizers, appropriate technology and \r\nagricultural extension advice, we can not only increase \r\nagricultural productivity in Africa, we can also provide \r\njobs for the growing population of young people on \r\nthe continent. That would also fit perfectly with the \r\nexpansion of agricultural processing and agribusiness, \r\nin which Africa has a comparative advantage.\r\nThe focus on access to sustainable and modern \r\nenergy in Goal 7 emphasizes the situation in Africa \r\ntoday, where a shortage of power remains a binding \r\nconstraint on our economic development. As an example, \r\nI can cite Ghana, where two decades of consistent \r\npositive economic growth have led to an average annual \r\nincrease in the demand for power of between 10 and \r\n12 per cent. As a result, the demand for electricity has \r\nexceeded the supply. To keep our system running, we \r\nhave had to resort to implementing a load management \r\nsystem. Ghanaians, with their sense of humour, refer \r\nto it as dumso, which in our local language means “off \r\nand on”. We have put in place a programme to introduce \r\nemergency generation into the transmission system, \r\nbut we are mindful that we must ensure that we use \r\nas many clean energy sources as possible if we are to \r\nbenefit current and future generations.\r\nThe MDGs have been helpful for us. Over the past \r\n15 years they have helped us address socioeconomic \r\ninequalities and disparities in national, regional and \r\nglobal development. Since September 2000, the MDGs \r\nhave always been a core part of Ghana’s national \r\ndevelopment framework. That has helped us make \r\nmodest but significant progress in the achievement of \r\nthose Goals. Ghana is, therefore, well positioned and \r\npoised to pursue the SDGs in the post-2015 development \r\nera.\r\nAs one of Africa’s fastest growing economies, \r\nGhana’s rise to middle-income status has presented \r\nus with both opportunities and daunting challenges. \r\nWith the inspiration and guidance of the SDGs, we are \r\nconfident of our ability to surmount those trials. We \r\nhave a vision and a development agenda for the next \r\n15 years and, on behalf of the Government and people \r\nof Ghana, I pledge our support and commitment to work \r\ntowards the achievement of the SDGs and look forward \r\nto working with other regional and global partners to \r\nmake them a reality.\r\nOur world is well endowed with resources and can \r\nensure that every man, woman, child, and every person \r\nwith a disability or aged person, can live a happy, \r\nfulfilled and secure life of hope and promise and not one \r\nof poverty and disillusionment. The time for collective \r\naction for the progress we all yearn for is now. The \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nwill transform our world. And Ghana is committed to \r\ntheir implementation.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of \r\nGhana for his statement.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the United Mexican \r\nStates.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Peña Nieto (spoke in Spanish): What \r\nbetter way to celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nOrganization of the United Nations than by renewing the \r\nhope of a future of opportunities for all of the countries \r\nof the world? Mexico celebrates the adoption of the \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (resolution \r\n70/1), a historic agreement for humanity in support \r\nof social inclusion, shared prosperity, environmental \r\nprotection, respect for human rights and universal \r\npeace. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 \r\ntargets of the Agenda reflect the will and commitment \r\nof nations to address the complex social, economic and \r\nenvironmental challenges of our time.\r\nIt is clear that there are no easy solutions or shortcuts \r\nfor solving the problems of humanity. The positive and \r\nlasting changes that are so vital for our present world \r\ncan be achieved only with responsibility, perseverance \r\nand shared work. That is precisely the essence of the \r\n2030 Agenda, namely, to constitute a serious, far-\r\nreaching global alliance based on the values and hopes \r\nthat gave rise to the Organization of the United Nations. \r\nThis transcendent document is the fruit of an inclusive, \r\nconstructive and transparent dialogue that gives new \r\nlife to multilateralism as a transformative force for our \r\ncivilization.\r\nIt has been a great honour for Mexico to take \r\npart in the consultative forums and, of course, in the \r\nfinal negotiation on the new Agenda. With pride and \r\nsatisfaction, my country commends the inclusion \r\n15-29253 13/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nin Agenda 2030 of a number of proposals that we \r\nput forward: first, the establishment of social and \r\neconomic inclusion as the guiding principle for the \r\nnew Sustainable Development Goals; secondly, the \r\nadoption of a broader definition of poverty, based on \r\na multidimensional focus that, in addition to counting \r\nindividual incomes, also takes into account people’s \r\neffective access to fundamental rights such as food, \r\neducation, health, social security and basic housing \r\nservices; thirdly, the consideration of gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment as cross-cutting factors \r\nfor development; fourthly, the recognition of the rights \r\nof migrants and their positive contribution to the \r\ndevelopment of their countries, both their countries of \r\norigin and their countries of destination; and fifthly, \r\nthe inclusion of the preservation of biodiversity and the \r\nadoption of national commitments to address climate \r\nchange as key instruments for sustainable development. \r\nIn keeping with that responsibility, Mexico will host, in \r\n2016, the Conference of the Parties to the Convention \r\non Biological Diversity. Sixthly, the rule of law must \r\nbe recognized as an indispensable requirement for \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFrom this point on, with respect to the definition \r\nof the 2030 Agenda, it is up to individual countries \r\nto implement the public policies that will allow \r\nthem to fulfil their Goals and targets. In that regard, \r\nMexico urges all countries to take ownership of the \r\nprinciples that characterize the new paradigm of open \r\ngovernment. That, indeed, is what we will propose in \r\nthe Open Government Summit, which will take place \r\nin my country a month from now.\r\nThe international community has succeeded in \r\nagreeing on Agenda 2030. The challenge now is to \r\nachieve its effective implementation. Although the \r\nAgenda itself is universal, its full implementation \r\ndepends on national strategies. With that understanding, \r\nMexico regards Agenda 2030 as a State commitment \r\nand as a collective mission. By joining our efforts, will \r\nand resources, we will meet its Goals and targets and \r\nbe able to positively transform the lives of millions of \r\nMexicans, and by so doing, we will also contribute to \r\nuniversal development.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of \r\nMexico for his statement.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Lithuania.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Grybauskaitė: The year 2015 is a crucial \r\none for sustainable development. We are very satisfied \r\nwith the successful conclusion of the negotiations on \r\nthe new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), which is a transformative and, most \r\nimportantly, a people-centred document. I hope it will \r\nmake a lasting impact on our future. The effective \r\nimplementation of that ambitious Agenda is of central \r\nimportance. Let me highlight several key issues that are \r\nessential for achieving our goals.\r\nFirst of all, we must focus on ensuring peace and \r\nsecurity. Without peace, we will not be able to build \r\nresilient societies, eradicate the causes of poverty or \r\nmeet the expectations of the international community.\r\nSecondly, the essential building block of a \r\nprosperous society is democracy. The lack of democracy \r\nis the main reason for conflicts, social and military \r\nupheavals, economic hardship and other problems. \r\nToday, the continuous threat to the development of \r\nour Eastern European partners, in particular Ukraine, \r\nworries us. The support of the international community, \r\nvoiced by the United Nations, is needed by those \r\ncalling for freedom and self-determination worldwide. \r\nDemocracy and the rule of law should be guaranteed to \r\neveryone.\r\nOne of the Goals of the 2030 Agenda, our new \r\ndevelopment agenda, is gender equality, but women are \r\nstill suffering from basic violence. Therefore, the first \r\nstep is to guarantee their safety. The second step is to \r\nensure gender equality through national programmes \r\nand proper accountability. Strong political commitment \r\non the part of all actors at all levels is crucial in that \r\nrespect. Furthermore, the international community has \r\nto engage more deeply in providing support for building \r\ninclusive institutions of good governance.\r\nIn order to achieve our long-term Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, we also have to react to new issues \r\nthat arise. For example, the issue of immigration is a \r\nchallenge that requires the attention of all members \r\nof the international community. The effective use of \r\ndevelopment cooperation can create a strong force \r\nfor managing immigration f lows and addressing the \r\nroot causes of sudden migration. It is our moral duty \r\n14/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nto provide a safe haven for those striving but unable \r\nto find peace, freedom and democracy in their own \r\ncountries. There is no doubt that the success of the \r\nnew Agenda for Sustainable Development depends on \r\nhow we identify and mobilize all necessary means for \r\nimplementation.\r\nThe final essential issue that has to be addressed \r\nis related to responsibility. There can be no opting out. \r\nGlobal partnership means global responsibility. For the \r\nnext 15 years, sustainable development and cooperation \r\nmust be built on ensuring peace and security, \r\nguaranteeing human rights, including the rights of \r\nwomen and children, gender equality, supporting \r\ndemocracy, and the building of inclusive institutions of \r\ngood governance.\r\nTo conclude, we must not forget that only by joining \r\nthe efforts of the international community as a whole \r\ncan we attain effective sustainable development, which \r\nis the goal we would like to achieve.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Lithuania for her statement.\r\nMs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of Montenegro.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Vujanović (spoke in Montenegrin; \r\ntranslation provided by the delegation): It is my great \r\nhonour to address the General Assembly at this Summit, \r\nwhich represents a historic milestone in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations. At the outset, I would like to express my \r\ngratitude to the Permanent Representatives of Ireland \r\nand Kenya, the facilitators of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process that resulted in the harmonization \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). We believe that the new Agenda, \r\ncovering the next 15 years, will enable us to fulfil \r\nthe projected vision aimed at ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human dignity for all.\r\nThe year 2015 is crucial for the future work of this \r\nOrganization. It is also the year in which we mark the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the founding of the United \r\nNations. I believe that there is no better time to consider \r\nwhat has been achieved so far in all areas of activity \r\nof the United Nations. Moreover, we can be satisfied \r\nwith the progress achieved in the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and with the \r\nharmonization of the ambitious and comprehensive, \r\nbut also realistic, 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nMontenegro strongly supports the adoption of \r\nthe new post-2015 development agenda. We confirm \r\nour commitment to implementing it completely. \r\nAn extremely demanding task of implementation, \r\nmonitoring and review of the progress achieved is \r\nbefore us. We believe that in fulfilling that task we \r\nneed to follow the basic principles of inclusiveness, \r\nempowerment, transparency and respect for human \r\nrights. We have advocated for the creation of a \r\ntransformative agenda based on the principle of respect \r\nfor human rights and believe that the universal respect \r\nfor human rights will be the measure of our success in \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nWe commend the central role played by the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich will follow up on and review the implementation \r\nof new Agenda at the global level, The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals that have been set raise a wide \r\nrange of interrelated issues and challenges. We are of \r\nthe opinion that each country is responsible for its own \r\nsocial and economic development. National strategies \r\nfor sustainable development should, therefore, be \r\nbased on the approach that the production of goods \r\nand services is crucial to improving the material and \r\nspiritual well-being of the population and requires \r\nsustainable management of the four basic groups of \r\nnational resources, namely, human, social, natural and \r\neconomic resources.\r\nKey national resources must remain viable so that \r\nwe can preserve the right to development for each next \r\ngeneration. The right to development should be seen \r\nin relation to humankind, relevant social groups at \r\nthe national and local levels, and families, along with \r\nfamily values. In essence, sustainability requires that \r\nwe undertake consistent political actions focused on \r\nthe development of human resources, on stimulating \r\ninvestments focused on those objectives and on \r\npreventing decisions that diminish national resources.\r\nNational strategies for sustainable development \r\nsupported by integrated national financial frameworks \r\noperating in the international economic environment \r\nmust be strengthened through effective mechanisms. \r\n15-29253 15/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nTherefore, in the process of their development and \r\nimplementation and in the establishment of a framework \r\nfor monitoring and accountability, close cooperation \r\nwith all stakeholders is necessary at all levels, including \r\nin parliaments, the civilian and business sectors and \r\nacademia. An inclusive approach is a prerequisite \r\nfor the success of the implementation of our future \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nWe believe that the implementation of the new \r\npost-2015 development agenda and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, as reflected in the final document \r\nadopted at this Summit, must be achieved as part \r\nof a revitalized global partnership for sustainable \r\ndevelopment and supported by specific policies and \r\nactions, as identified in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\non financing for development, which should serve as \r\nan integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nMontenegro’s commitment to a policy of \r\nsustainable development cannot be questioned. Its \r\nstrategic development policy and guidelines touch \r\nupon all dimensions of socioeconomic development. \r\nThroughout the past two decades, Montenegro has \r\nmaintained its Constitutional decision to consider \r\nitself an ecological State and has exerted the political \r\nwill, dedication, persistence, courage and substantial \r\nfinancial investment to bring that about. That approach \r\nwas particularly significant in helping us to overcome \r\nthe negative trends that emerged during the transition \r\nperiod and later during the global economic crisis. \r\nAlthough we have faced numerous challenges, we in \r\nMontenegro have consistently worked to make our \r\nsocioeconomic development more sustainable and \r\npreserve our natural resources for future generations. \r\nMontenegro was one of the first countries in South-\r\nEastern Europe to established a strategic and \r\ninstitutional framework for sustainable development \r\nin accordance with the standards of the developed \r\ncountries of the European Union.\r\nGuided by our own experience in implementing \r\nsustainable development policies and through \r\nour membership in the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals and our participation \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations, we have made a \r\nsignificant contribution towards the consensus reached \r\non a transformative, universal and comprehensive \r\nagenda that integrates the social, economic and \r\nenvironmental aspects of sustainable development. \r\nWe are pleased that many of our priorities have been \r\nincluded in the new Agenda. As a result, the fulfilment \r\nof the vision of the 2030 Agenda will require substantial \r\nefforts in the areas of eradicating poverty and inequality \r\nand creating peaceful, just and inclusive societies based \r\non the rule of law and good governance at every level.\r\nConscious of the importance of implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda, we are already in the process of drafting a \r\nnew national post-2015 sustainable development strategy \r\nthat will incorporate the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand harmonize them with our national framework. \r\nThrough our policies, which are to be based on our \r\npost-2015 Sustainable Development Goals, we will \r\nencourage the participation of individuals, families \r\nand social groups, while at the same time ensuring the \r\nsustainable and integrated conservation of our human, \r\nsocial, natural and economic resources.\r\nThis Summit on the post-2015 development agenda \r\nwas preceded by the third International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development held in Addis Ababa, at \r\nwhich we adopted the outcome document establishing a \r\nfinancial framework for sustainable development. The \r\nnew Agenda provides us with strong momentum for \r\nintensifying our efforts at the end of 2015 to adopt, in \r\nParis, a comprehensive, ambitious and legally binding \r\nagreement on climate change that is applicable to all \r\ncountries. We believe that by year’s end we will have \r\nreached an agreement on climate change that will be \r\nanother acknowledgement of the responsibility and \r\nwillingness of all countries and stakeholders to meet \r\ntheir obligations under a new chapter in the history \r\nof development. In that regard, Montenegro is ready \r\nto support a strengthened global climate agreement \r\nby reducing its national greenhouse-gas emissions by \r\n2030 by 30 per cent compared to their 1990 levels.\r\nThe post-2015 development agenda gives us the \r\nhope that we can build a peaceful and prosperous world. \r\nWe all share responsibility for its implementation. We \r\nare the generation that can and must make every effort \r\nto fulfil the vision of our 2030 Agenda.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of \r\nMontenegro for his statement.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\n16/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nMr. Sogavare (Solomon Islands): The Solomon \r\nIslands welcomes the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). The new Agenda is \r\nabout people and seeks to pursue prosperity through \r\npartnerships, while operating within safe levels of our \r\nplanet’s capacity. We are committed to implementing \r\nthe 17 transformative Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) and their 169 targets within our national \r\ncontext and circumstances. This historic Agenda \r\npresents a new and ambitious framework for sustainable \r\ndevelopment that requires us to act urgently to reverse \r\nour current unsustainable global consumption and \r\nproduction patterns. We must, therefore, seek new \r\nways of doing business and measuring wealth that are \r\nlinked to guaranteeing the survival of humankind. In \r\nthat regard, the Sustainable Development Goals must \r\nremain people-centred.\r\nThe overarching objective of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals is not just to eradicate poverty; \r\nit is also about healing the declining health of our \r\nplanet. Preserving life on Earth must be our shared \r\nresponsibility, for prosperity cannot be pursued in a \r\ndead environment. The 17 time-bound Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals must now become a highway for \r\nglobal partnerships and be matched with sufficient \r\nresources, if we are to meaningfully transform our \r\npeoples’ lives.\r\nAs a small island developing State (SIDS), the \r\nSolomon Islands remains a special case in the area of \r\nsustainable development, given our vulnerability to \r\nclimate change and our unique characteristics, which \r\nrequire special attention from the global community. \r\nWe are committed to delivering on sustainable \r\ndevelopment nationally under the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway (resolution 69/15) and the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action, which can enable SIDS and \r\nleast-developed countries (LDCs) to leapfrog from \r\ndevelopment to sustainability.\r\nThe Solomon Islands will be reviewing its \r\ncooperation programmes to ensure that they are aligned \r\nwith the Sustainable Development Goals in the context \r\nof our national priorities. We will incorporate the Goals \r\ninto our 20-year, 2016-2036 national development \r\nstrategy by the end of this year or in the first quarter \r\nof the next. We therefore call on all our development \r\npartners to support our efforts.\r\nIn the area of sustainable energy, the Solomon \r\nIslands is currently working on two hydro projects with \r\nthe World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. Both \r\nprojects remain on our post-2015 agenda. We are also \r\nseeking partnerships so that we can make progress on \r\nother hydro projects and also realize our potential in \r\nthe area of geothermal and wind energy. Currently, \r\n85 per cent of the population of Solomon Islands is \r\nnot connected to the energy grid. We need partners to \r\ninvest in large-scale, game-changing energy projects \r\nin our rural areas that can open up opportunities for \r\nour population and free up the one third of our national \r\nbudget that is spent on importing fossil fuels.\r\nWith regard to agriculture, we call on our \r\ndevelopment partners to assist us in integrating our \r\nrural sector into the mainstream economy and in \r\nensuring that it enjoy its fair share of the global market. \r\nBuilding a resilient economy for the Solomon Islands \r\nwill require significant international cooperation with \r\nour efforts to construct an environmentally sound \r\ninfrastructure in the areas of energy, transportation, \r\ncommunication, agriculture, tourism and information \r\nand technology.\r\nThe new 2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda and the agreement on climate change that \r\nwe hope to see concluded in Paris in December are \r\nintricately linked to sustainable development. On \r\nclimate change, the science is clear; we are heading \r\ntowards a global temperature increase of between 3°C \r\nand 3.5°C. That will leave the small island developing \r\nStates and the LDCs behind, unless those with historical \r\nresponsibility for causing the climate change do more \r\nand submit ambitious mitigation commitments under \r\ntheir intended, nationally determined contributions. In \r\nthe lead-up to the twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change in Paris, I should remind \r\nus all once again of the Suva Declaration on Climate \r\nChange, issued by the Pacific Islands Developing \r\nForum, which calls for stabilizing the increase in global \r\ntemperatures at a level well below 1.5°C. The outcome \r\nagreement of the Paris Conference should be ambitious, \r\ncomprehensive and legally binding, with agreements on \r\nloss and damage issues anchored in it as a stand-alone \r\nchapter.\r\nLet me close with the words of the late Nelson \r\nMandela, “Poverty is man-made and can be eradicated”. \r\nTo that I would add that climate change is also man-\r\nmade and can be reversed.\r\n15-29253 17/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nWe are here to make history. To that end we must \r\nprovide honest and quality political leadership that \r\nsecures and guarantees hope for our people and our \r\nplanet. Let us go forward and urgently get on with the \r\ntask of creating a better future for our children, their \r\nchildren, and generations to come.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands for his statement.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Musveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the President of the Government of the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Nikola Gruevski, President of the Government \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Gruevski (Former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia): We are gathered at this Summit to adopt \r\na bold and universal agenda for ending poverty, \r\nimproving the well-being of citizens and protecting \r\nour planet. I would like to pay tribute to all Member \r\nStates and other relevant actors that have worked \r\ntirelessly on the outcome document that has now been \r\nadopted: “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development” (resolution 70/1). The 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals and 169 targets will be \r\nour guiding light in crafting the future for our countries \r\nand citizens. The vision for a more stable, peaceful, \r\nprosperous, inclusive and environmentally sustainable \r\nworld can be accomplished only if we join forces and \r\nwork together in partnership at the global, regional, \r\nnational and local levels.\r\nThe Central European Initiative, over which the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia currently presides, seeks to \r\nbe actively engaged in the implementation of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, and its member States have \r\nexpressed their readiness to make a concrete regional \r\ncontribution, to transfer know-how and to exchange \r\nbest practices in designing various sustainable \r\ndevelopment initiatives, in building the capacities of \r\npublic institutions and in raising awareness.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia contributes actively \r\nto those common goals. After the United Nations \r\nConference on Sustainable Development in Rio in \r\n2012, we began to integrate the principles of sustainable \r\ndevelopment into our national policies. We established \r\na National Council for Sustainable Development and \r\nadopted a national sustainable development strategy. \r\nIn July, we conducted a review of our progress in \r\nimplementing the strategy, the results of which have \r\nbeen communicated to the United Nations Department \r\nof Economic and Social Affairs and the Division for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe next step will be to integrate the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals into our strategic documents, \r\nincluding our sustainable development action plan. We \r\nexpect to receive support for that process under the new \r\nUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework \r\n2016-2020, which is being developed in consultation \r\nwith all relevant stakeholders. The Government \r\nconsulted non-governmental organizations and took \r\ntheir views into account when we answered the United \r\nNations questionnaire relating to the preparation of the \r\nSecretary General’s initial input to the Open Working \r\nGroup.\r\nWe have increased social transfers for socially \r\nvulnerable persons by over 50 per cent; special financial \r\nbenefits have been introduced and even increased \r\nfor the most vulnerable categories, especially for \r\nchildren without parental care, and we have exempted \r\nprivate-sector employers from payroll taxes for the \r\nemployment of such persons for a period of five or more \r\nyears. As a result of foreign investment and support for \r\nthe private sector, unemployment in our country has \r\nbeen reduced by over 11 per cent. The concept of free \r\nhealth care for every citizen has been introduced. We \r\nare investing in medical equipment and infrastructure, \r\nand the prices of pharmaceuticals have been reduced. \r\nIn addition, we are financing farmers through high \r\nbudgetary subsidies.\r\nWith respect to young people, the education budget \r\nin recent years has been between 5 and 6 per cent of \r\ngross domestic product, which is on a par with the \r\nlevel of countries in the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development. In the area of primary \r\neducation, we have implemented the Cambridge \r\nPrimary Science and Mathematics Curricula. English \r\nlanguage instruction starts in first grade, and a second \r\nforeign language begins in the sixth grade. We have \r\nprovided a computer for every child in primary and \r\nsecondary schools, as well as 80 modern laboratories \r\nfor the development of scientific research. We offer full \r\nscholarships for each citizen who manages to enrol at \r\none of the top 100 universities in the world.\r\n18/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nFor the employment of people under the age of \r\n35, the State pays contributions for social insurance \r\nand personal income tax. In line with Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 5 on the achievement of gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women and girls, \r\nwe are committed to eliminating all forms of violence \r\nagainst women and girls, especially to ending human \r\ntrafficking, for which we have received the highest \r\nassessment from the international sources. We are \r\nimproving the economic status of women through \r\nspecial programmes for the financing of women in \r\nthe job market, the employment of single mothers, the \r\nextension of maternity leave and special protection for \r\nemployed mothers and the promotion of the increased \r\nparticipation of women in political life, as well as \r\nmeasures to promote sexual and reproductive health.\r\nEven taking into consideration that there should \r\nbe a difference in the responsibilities of countries \r\nat different levels of development, as well as a fair \r\ndistribution of the burden of sustainable development, \r\nespecially in the area of climate change and pollution, \r\neach country should find its own strengths and bear a \r\nfair share of the burden for its own development. Let us \r\ndeliver together what we jointly have committed to today \r\nfor the future we want. The seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations obligates us, even more, to perform \r\nbetter.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of \r\nthe Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia for his statement.\r\nMr. Nikola Gruevski, President of the Government \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): Our joint international \r\nefforts over the years to realize sustainable development \r\nhave culminated in this historic adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. The new Agenda \r\ncontains five key elements known as the five Ps: people, \r\nplanet, prosperity, peace and partnership, at its core. \r\nIt also forges an ambitious plan of action in various \r\nfields including women, health, education, disaster \r\nrisk reduction and quality growth. Based on those core \r\ncomponents, which have all been emphasized by Japan, \r\nthe new Agenda will lead our efforts in ultimately \r\neradicating poverty from the earth and transforming \r\nthe world into a sustainable planet by 2030.\r\nJapan proposed international development goals as \r\nearly as the 1990s and has consistently contributed to \r\nthat endeavour. Japan therefore sincerely welcomes the \r\nadoption of the 2030 Agenda. I would like to express my \r\nrespect for the efforts made by all those who worked so \r\nhard to bring the process forward. In order to implement \r\nthis new, universal Agenda, we must overcome the \r\ntraditional North-South dichotomy; we must work \r\ntogether to instead build a new global partnership \r\nwhere all stakeholders, including all countries, the \r\nprivate sector and civil society, join forces and play \r\ntheir respective roles. Such a partnership should also be \r\none in which women, people with disabilities and the \r\nyoung proactively participate.\r\nI would like to reiterate that Japan, as part of \r\nthat partnership, will put forth its best possible \r\neffort, together with the international community, to \r\nimplement the Agenda. For the past 60 years, Japan has \r\ncontinuously contributed to the stability and prosperity \r\nof the international community by providing official \r\ndevelopment assistance amounting to approximately \r\n$330 billion in total, and by accepting 560,000 trainees \r\nand dispatching 190,000 experts and volunteers. \r\nBuilding upon those achievements, Japan will promote \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We will carry \r\nthat effort forward by applying the Development \r\nCooperation Charter of Japan as a compass, which was \r\nnewly established this year as a foundation for Japan’s \r\ndevelopment cooperation. In particular, we will do so \r\nbased on the concept of human security, the guiding \r\nprinciple of the Charter of the United Nations that \r\nfocuses on each and every individual.\r\nIn order to promote the Agenda, Japan will first \r\npursue various initiatives to achieve quality growth, \r\nby which we specifically mean inclusive, sustainable \r\nand resilient growth for all, and thereby to end poverty. \r\nTo achieve that aim, Japan will take a leading role \r\nin promoting quality infrastructure investment as \r\na foundation for quality growth — not only in Asia, \r\nbut across the world including in Africa. Additionally, \r\nusing development cooperation as a catalyst, Japan will \r\nexpand partnerships with the private sector in order \r\nto mobilize its financial resources and technologies. \r\nFurthermore, Japan will promote the development of \r\nindustrial human resources as a key driving force to \r\n15-29253 19/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nachieve such growth, taking advantage of our country’s \r\nhigh educational standards and advanced technology.\r\nThe second approach that Japan will emphasize is \r\nthe protection and empowerment of people in vulnerable \r\nsituations to ensure that no one is left behind. Since \r\nthe health field is an essential component in that effort, \r\nJapan has announced a new global health policy aimed \r\nat strengthening health systems to better prepare the \r\ninternational community for public health emergencies \r\nsuch as the outbreak of the Ebola virus disease and to \r\npromote universal health coverage in every country. \r\nIn education, Japan has established a new cooperation \r\nstrategy, entitled “Learning Strategy for Peace and \r\nGrowth”, that is focused on enhancing learning \r\nquality and supporting human resource development \r\nin industry, science and technology. In the field of \r\ndisaster risk reduction, Japan will take a leading role \r\nin implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted in March, and calls \r\nupon the international community to establish World \r\nTsunami Day at the United Nations to raise global \r\nawareness of the risk of tsunamis.\r\nThirdly, Japan will further strengthen efforts to \r\nachieve sustainability in the environment and in society. \r\nOn the issue of climate change, Japan will steadily \r\nimplement assistance particularly to the most vulnerable \r\ncountries and actively contribute to establishing a fair \r\nand effective international framework applicable to all \r\nparties at the upcoming session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. Moreover, Japan will share with the \r\nworld our renowned knowledge and efforts on building \r\na sound material-cycle society, including the concept of \r\nthe three Rs: reduce, reuse and recycle.\r\nLast but not least, the Japanese Government’s \r\npension investment fund, which operates a $1 trillion \r\npension fund and is the largest such fund in the \r\nworld, has just signed the United Nations Principles \r\nfor Responsible Investment, thereby contributing to \r\nthe achievement of sustainable development. In just \r\nthree months we will enter into the first year of the \r\nglobal endeavour towards 2030. We must take action \r\nimmediately to implement the new Agenda.\r\nLet me conclude my statement by reiterating our \r\ndetermination to tackle the important challenge of \r\nachieving sustainable development by making the most \r\nof the upcoming opportunities next year, such as the \r\nWorld Humanitarian Summit, and the International \r\nConference on African Development, the sixth such \r\nconference and the first to be held in Africa.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the Prime Minister of \r\nJapan for his statement.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nThailand.\r\nMr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Chan-o-cha (Thailand) (spoke in Thai; \r\nEnglish statement provided by the delegation): I have \r\ncome to this historic Summit to reaffirm that the \r\nGovernment and the people of Thailand stand with the \r\nglobal community in its resolve to realize the new 2030 \r\nSustainable Development Agenda (resolution 70/1). We \r\nare pleased that the 2030 Agenda places people at its \r\ncore, for people are the ultimate agents of change and \r\nplay a role in sustainable development. Our actions \r\ntoday will determine the survival of future generations.\r\nToday there is no longer any doubt that human \r\nactivity has been the prime contributor to climate \r\nchange, the greatest threat ever faced by humankind. \r\nKnowing all that we know now, we have a choice to make. \r\nWe can continue on the path of rampant consumerism \r\nand maximum growth at all costs. Or we can choose \r\nto live sustainably, with a focus on quality, moderation \r\nand balance in our lives. We can choose to respect \r\nnature, rather than viewing it merely as a commodity to \r\nexploit. What I have just said derives from His Majesty \r\nthe King’s “sufficiency economy” philosophy. The \r\nphilosophy, with its emphasis on reason, moderation \r\nand building resilience, has seen us through several \r\ncrises, including the 1997 financial crisis and the 2004 \r\ntsunami. It also helped Thailand achieve nearly all of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, and it is the basis \r\nfor our 2015-2020 vision and the forthcoming national \r\neconomic and social development plan.\r\nAnother pressing challenge of our time is inequality. \r\nIt is the root cause of such problems as poverty, conflict \r\nover resources, and irregular migration, which can, in \r\nturn, spawn violence. To address inequality, we must \r\nfirst have effective laws. The Thai Government has \r\npassed a number of bills, for example, on protecting \r\nthe homeless, promoting gender equality and providing \r\nequitable access to resources and public services. We \r\n20/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nwant to create a level playing field for all, to promote \r\ngood governance, accountability and transparency in \r\npublic administration, and to combat corruption and \r\nnepotism.\r\nSecondly, the intrinsic worth of each and \r\nevery human being must be recognized. The Thai \r\nGovernment is working to empower the vulnerable and \r\nthe disenfranchised. Various measures have therefore \r\nbeen put in place, such as universal health coverage, a \r\nnational retirement savings fund, an increased monthly \r\nallowance for the elderly and the disabled and a subsidy \r\nfor babies newly born into poor families. We are also \r\nstriving to strengthen the individual and the family, \r\nenhance community involvement and promote social \r\ncohesiveness.\r\nSimilar support is also provided to non-citizens. \r\nLast year, the Thai Government offered social and \r\nlegal protection to unskilled migrant workers, and over \r\n1.6 million migrants were registered and regularized \r\nfor employment to protect them from human rights \r\nabuses and human trafficking.\r\nNevertheless, many people still need help. And \r\nto reach them, especially the most vulnerable groups, \r\nwe must improve our statistics and disaggregated data \r\nto give them visibility and ensure that their needs are \r\nmore precisely addressed. At the same time, the social \r\nrecognition of such groups is also important, and we \r\nmust build a society that is compassionate, respects \r\nhumanity and embraces equality.\r\nThirdly, we need to create an environment that \r\nenables and sustains development. To lay strong \r\nsocioeconomic foundations, the Thai Government \r\nhas been empowering local communities through the \r\nestablishment of village funds, including women’s \r\nempowerment funds, across the country. The funds are \r\nused to assist local small and medium-sized enterprises \r\nand have been effective in helping to generate jobs \r\nand income for the rural masses. The Government \r\nis also helping farmers to settle their debts and \r\npromoting sustainable agriculture practices and agro-\r\nindustry through local knowledge sharing and modern \r\ntechnology. While Thailand enjoys full employment, \r\nthe Government has also been helping low-income \r\npeople to find jobs through the so-called smart jobs \r\ncentres.\r\nFourthly, we believe in reducing inequality, not \r\nonly within countries but also among them, through \r\ndevelopment partnerships. We have been working \r\nto narrow the development gaps in mainland South-\r\nEast Asia, starting with our neighbours, by promoting \r\nconnectivity and setting up six special economic zones \r\nalong our borders under what we call the Thailand Plus \r\nOne initiative.\r\nOnly when individuals and communities are strong \r\ncan our nations and the global community discover \r\ntrue strength. In the next 15 years, we should see \r\nunprecedented reductions in inequality and poverty. \r\nThailand stands ready to work with all countries and \r\nthe United Nations to that end for a stable, prosperous \r\nand sustainable world.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the Prime Minister of \r\nThailand for his statement.\r\nMr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of \r\nThailand, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy \r\nof Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Communications and the Media \r\nand Minister of Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Bettel (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): Being \r\nuniversal, proactive and transparent have never been \r\nmore imperative principles for the United Nations than \r\ntoday, when news accounts of bloody conflicts are \r\nmixed with the sombre warnings of environmental and \r\nclimate-change disasters.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) represents a singular leap forward. The \r\ntime for reflection is past; now is the time for action. \r\nOur challenge is twofold: to ensure that the 17 new \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) continue the \r\nmomentum of the Millennium Development Goals to \r\neradicate poverty and hunger throughout the world and \r\nto permit us to focus joint development efforts on long-\r\nterm sustainability. That is why we need to rigorously \r\nmonitor the implementation of those Goals to be able \r\nto objectively measure progress in terms of what has \r\nbeen and what has yet to be achieved. United Nations \r\nleadership, supported by regional and national efforts, \r\nshould guarantee the inclusive and interdisciplinary \r\nimplementation of the Agenda.\r\nOur global environment remains dependent on \r\ndiffering rhythms and speeds. Our resolve for the year \r\n15-29253 21/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\n2030 may therefore appear distant to some, whereas it \r\nis, in fact, tomorrow. We must make no mistake, the \r\n2030 Agenda is the responsibility of our generation, \r\nand future generations will judge us on our ability to \r\nact. The transformative power of the Agenda should \r\nintroduce a new quality to the dialogue among nations. \r\nIn that context, the updated universality inherent in \r\nthe common Agenda cannot be realized without the \r\nview of shared responsibility and without the ongoing \r\npromotion of respect for all human rights and the \r\nprinciples of good governance. As never before, civil \r\nsociety has been urged to participate in the dialogue and \r\nthe pursuit of the objectives declared in the 17 SDGs.\r\nThe old categories of North and South, of developed \r\nand developing countries, have become obsolete. Now \r\ndialogue among equals on topics that concern all of us \r\nwill allow us to provide the foundation for a world more \r\negalitarian and interdependent world. We must ensure \r\nthat the competitive race does not lead to low standards \r\ntoday and to onerous and irreversible consequences \r\ntomorrow.\r\nThe protection of the environment, the fight against \r\nclimate change and the integration of social criteria \r\nshould not be perceived as a threat to industry or as a \r\nbrake on economic development. Rather, those Goals \r\ncan contribute to the development of clean technologies \r\nand help us to engage in greater diversification of \r\nour economies by promoting sustainable growth. \r\nSome companies on my continent have noted that \r\nother continents have less severe regulation of the \r\nenvironment, so they plan to leave our countries to set \r\nup elsewhere. While we often talk about tax and social \r\ndumping, we must also act to end such environmental \r\ndumping. The cafeteria lunch I had today was crucial, \r\nbecause everyone was committed to moving forward \r\nin the same direction. Moving forward in another \r\ndirection makes no sense at all.\r\nSecondly, we should not forget that the mere scope \r\nof the new SDGs compared to the earlier MDGs will \r\nrequire diversified and mutually complementary \r\nsources of funding. Official development assistance \r\nremains a crucial lever to provide additional capital. \r\nLuxembourg encourages all developed countries to \r\ninvest 0.7 per cent of their gross national income in \r\nofficial development assistance. In that context, I would \r\nlike to remind the Assembly that, for several years, our \r\nnational contribution amount has been 1 per cent of our \r\ngross national income.\r\nWhat we say today in this Hall should be the same \r\nthing we say in our countries at home. We must honour \r\nour international commitments to official development \r\nassistance, which must reach 0.7 per cent of the gross \r\nnational income, and to international climate funding, \r\nwhich by 2020 is to reach $100 billion annually, as \r\ndecided in Copenhagen in 2009. We must not resort to \r\nthe notion that charity begins at home and the populist \r\ntalk that claims we have enough problems to address \r\nat home in our countries, so why help other people If \r\nwe look at ourselves in the mirror and if we are honest, \r\nwe will admit that what we are complaining about \r\nin our home countries is trif ling. We are incredibly \r\nsuccessful, while in other parts of the world people \r\ndo not know if they are going to be able to feed their \r\nchildren more than once a day. It is foolish to complain \r\nthat the water is tepid — not hot or cold enough— when \r\nin other countries they are happy to have enough water \r\nto be able to survive. So we need to be reasonable. We \r\nmust look in the mirror and realize that some of the \r\nproblems we have in our countries are superficial and \r\nrelated to abundance.\r\nBeyond ongoing programmatic efforts, the support \r\nof the private sector and its awareness-raising are key \r\nwhen working with public authorities to achieve the \r\nGoals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nThe Goals should complement the picture so that there \r\nis no duplication or contradiction. Luxembourg is \r\nparticularly committed to the respect and promotion \r\nof social rights. The 2030 Agenda should be able to \r\nguarantee decent working conditions for all. The third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\ndrafted a number of important paths to follow, and \r\nthe conclusions of that Conference will serve as an \r\nimportant basis for the implementation of our Agenda. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda takes into account, not only the \r\nincreased interconnectedness between different areas \r\nin an era of globalization but also the impact of this \r\non the environment and climate. The environmental \r\naspect of sustainability, the conservation of natural \r\nresources, the protection of biodiversity and ensuring \r\nfood security — all such concerns are fundamental in \r\nensuring prosperity and well-being for all.\r\nWe must unlock the engines of a “green economy”, \r\nwhich for my country means that we do not use nuclear \r\nenergy. We need to make our economies and our \r\nlifestyles more equitable, more sustainable and more \r\neffective in eradicating poverty. We are not going to \r\nresolve the crisis of poverty and migration without \r\n22/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\naddresssing the challenges posed by climate change \r\nand the environment. We will not overcome major \r\ncrises — migration, wars and hunger — unless we \r\nrestore dignity to men and women, while respecting the \r\nEarth which feeds us.\r\nFor a long time now, Luxembourg has focused \r\non a development policy that promotes long-term \r\nsustainable results. Inclusiveness is the inevitable \r\ncorollary of that approach, based on objective analyses, \r\nlistening to various stakeholders and monitoring that \r\nincludes the participation of all stakeholders. That is \r\nalso the best path to follow to ensure the success of the \r\n2030 Agenda and to bring about a truly united world, \r\nand one in which humankind is sensitive to the need \r\nfor integrated harmonious development and eager to \r\npreserve our planet and to improve the daily life and \r\ndignity for all of us.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister, \r\nMinister of State, Minister for Communications and the \r\nMedia and Minister of Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, for his statement.\r\nMr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Communications and the Media \r\nand Minister of Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister, First Lord of \r\nthe Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nThe Right Honourable David Cameron, Prime \r\nMinister, First Lord of the Treasury and Minister \r\nfor the Civil Service of the United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum\r\nMr. Cameron (United Kingdom): We meet at \r\nan important moment. Today, we celebrate the huge \r\nprogress that the world has made towards the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) and we commit to going \r\neven further through the new Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Since the MDGs were adopted in the year 2000 \r\n(resolution 55/2), we have made huge strides forward. \r\nThe proportion of people living in extreme poverty has \r\nfallen significantly. Malaria deaths have fallen by 60 per \r\ncent since 2000, saving more than 6 million lives. And \r\n43 million fewer children are out of school. I am proud \r\nto lead a country that has made a huge contribution to \r\nthat extraordinary progress.\r\nThe United Kingdom’s open markets, trade and \r\ninvestment have helped to spur global growth. Our \r\nscientists have developed new technologies for the \r\nworld’s poorest. And, crucially, we have kept our \r\npromises on aid. We have not just achieved the 0.7 per \r\ncent target of the United Nations; we have enshrined \r\nit in the law of our land. That investment is helping \r\nthe world’s poorest and most vulnerable people to \r\nlead a better life. Children have been vaccinated who \r\notherwise would have died. Refugees have been fed and \r\nclothed who otherwise would have starved. Countries \r\nwere accorded a chance of stability and security that \r\notherwise could have fallen apart. Aid is not enough on \r\nits own. Of course not. But it is essential. And it works.\r\nToday, therefore, I call on others to follow Britain’s \r\nlead. I say to my fellow world leaders from developed \r\ncountries: we have been making those aid promises \r\nfor years. Now, let us all deliver on them. The world \r\nis watching. And now, as we adopt these new Goals, \r\nlet us inspire the world with what we want to achieve: \r\nto reduce preventable deaths to zero, to eliminate \r\nilliteracy and malnutrition and to eradicate extreme \r\npoverty within a generation. That is a clarion call to the \r\nwhole world.\r\nTo eliminate the scourge of extreme poverty for the \r\nfirst time in human history is something that has been \r\ndreamed of for centuries, something that many thought \r\nwould never happen, but something that is now within \r\nour grasp. I am delighted that ending extreme poverty \r\nforever is at the heart of the new Goals. It is something \r\nthat I pushed hard for. And I am delighted that we have \r\nrecognized that to end extreme poverty, we need to put \r\nthe poorest, the weakest and the most marginalized \r\nfirst — to leave no one behind.\r\nBut today, together, we commit to going even \r\nfurther. There can be no attack on poverty without \r\nan assault on climate change. We therefore commit \r\nto making progress in a way that is sustainable and \r\nprotects our one and only planet for the long term, \r\nand treasures and conserves our natural resources for \r\nfuture generations. That is the only way to eliminate \r\nextreme poverty forever and to prevent all our progress \r\nfrom being undone by environmental degradation or \r\ndangerous climate change.\r\nAnd there can be no attack on poverty without \r\nending gender inequality. Today, therefore, we commit \r\nto a world where women and girls are treated equally \r\nwith men and boys. And, crucially, we commit to \r\n15-29253 23/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\ntackling all the causes of poverty. Let us be frank, \r\nespecially here, about what keeps so many stuck in \r\npoverty: corruption, rotten government, no access to \r\njustice, no property rights, no rule of law. Today, for \r\nthe first time, every country in the world is committing \r\nto tackling corruption, to promoting the rule of law and \r\naccess to justice, to reducing illicit financial f lows and \r\nto strengthening the return of stolen assets.\r\nWe are committing to building accountable \r\nand transparent institutions and representative \r\ndecision-making to ensure that everyone has a legal \r\nidentity and access to information. We are saying \r\nthat we must protect basic freedoms. For a long time, \r\nthose issues were off the global development agenda. \r\nNow they are right at the top of it, and everyone has \r\nsigned up. That was one of the key recommendations \r\nof the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the \r\nPost-2015 Development Agenda, which I co-chaired \r\nalong with the Presidents of Liberia and Indonesia, in \r\nits report entitled “A new global partnership: eradicate \r\npoverty and transform economies through sustainable \r\ndevelopment”. I am delighted that it is being adopted \r\nhere today. Achieving these Goals will take actions, \r\nnot words. In addition to aid, we need investment, \r\ntrade, growth and jobs. I therefore urge companies \r\naround the world to invest in developing products for \r\nthe poorest and in new forms of clean energy. And I \r\nurge Governments to smash down the unfair barriers \r\nthat prevent our people from trading freely, starting at \r\nthe meeting of the World Trade Organization later this \r\nyear.\r\nAnd let us go even further. We need a new global \r\npartnership to ensure that all our policies — on things \r\nlike tax, trade and transparency — really help to deliver \r\nprogress for the poorest. The United Kingdom will lead \r\nthe way internationally, just as we did leading this \r\nAgenda with our 2013 presidency of the Group of Eight.\r\nThat is why I have agreed to host a major \r\nanti-corruption summit next year, to drive further \r\naction. I therefore assure leaders in Government, \r\nbusiness and communities around the world that, if \r\nthey are committed to making progress towards those \r\nglobal goals, the United Kingdom is on their side and \r\nwill work with them on our shared quest.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister, \r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury and Minister for the Civil \r\nService of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland for his statement.\r\nMr. David Cameron, Prime Minister, First Lord of \r\nthe Treasury and Minister for the Civil Service of \r\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth,Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth (Mauritius): I am pleased \r\nand honoured to participate in this crucial Summit. It \r\nmarks the culmination of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) era and the transition to the new period \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nFor the past 15 years, the MDGs have remained \r\na focus for global policy debates and national policy \r\nplanning in many developing countries, including \r\nmy own. There is a broad consensus that they have \r\nplayed an important part in securing substantial \r\nprogress in fighting poverty. We all agree that a \r\nglobally endorsed agenda for fighting poverty should \r\ncontinue beyond 2015. In a world already undergoing \r\ndramatic shifts, including climate change and other \r\nserious environmental ills, there is widespread \r\nunderstanding that global environmental objectives \r\nneed a greater international emphasis and commitment, \r\nalongside those concerned with poverty reduction. The \r\nfocus is now on building a sustainable world where \r\nenvironmental sustainability, social inclusion and \r\neconomic development are equally valued.\r\nMauritius has by and large met the MDGs, \r\nespecially in the areas of education, gender equality \r\nand poverty reduction. We are, however, faced with \r\nsome emerging concerns and priorities related to the \r\nwidening of the income gap, unemployment that results \r\nfrom a skills mismatch, demographic challenges and \r\nenvironmental and climate-change issues that can \r\naffect the achievement of both the MDGs and the new \r\nSDGs.\r\nMauritius is comforted that the new global \r\ndevelopment agenda, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), espouses its own \r\nsustainable development agenda, one that I laid out \r\n24/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nat the national level in my Vision 2030 economic \r\nmission statement on 22 August. This shared Agenda \r\nemphasizes poverty eradication and social inclusiveness \r\nas indispensable to sustainable development. It is \r\ndedicated to offering a life of dignity to all, through \r\nthe provision of nutritious food, safe drinking water, \r\ngood sanitation, affordable and reliable energy, health \r\ncare, housing, productive employment and decent jobs, \r\nquality education, conflict prevention and the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance.\r\nThe Agenda is people-centred and guarantees \r\nrights, justice, freedoms and access to information. \r\nIt promotes and supports sustainable oceans, forests, \r\nagriculture and land ecosystems and a sustainable \r\nclimate on Earth. I am here today not only to endorse \r\nour new global development Agenda but also to affirm \r\nmy country’s strong political commitment to its timely \r\nimplementation.\r\nSince climate-related concerns represent real \r\nthreats to life on our planet, Mauritius looks forward to \r\nthe adoption of a binding agreement on climate change \r\nat the twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December. \r\nMy Government is fully committed to effectively \r\nmonitoring climate variability and change as well as \r\naddressing the problems related to rises in sea levels in \r\ncoastal regions.\r\nWe particularly welcome the inclusion in the 2030 \r\nAgenda of a stand-alone goal on the oceans. It is a cause \r\nthat we have championed in international negotiations. \r\nThe conservation and sustainable use of the world’s \r\noceans, including the high seas, is very important to the \r\nwell-being of humankind. Mauritius plans to develop \r\nits ocean economy as one of the pillars of its sustainable \r\ndevelopment path. Given the vital role of the oceans, \r\nreducing water pollution and protecting marine \r\necosystem services and biodiversity are imperative.\r\nAs a small developing island, we believe it is \r\nurgent that the global community take into account \r\nthe specific vulnerabilities and challenges of small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS). We must address the \r\nsupply-side constraints on SIDS in order to ensure their \r\nintegration into the global trading system, and we must \r\nadopt a pragmatic approach with regard to the question \r\nof special treatment in the areas of financial access to \r\nclimate funds and technical assistance for SIDS, as well \r\nas trade. We firmly believe that SIDS should be granted \r\nspecial international recognition within the United \r\nNations system.\r\nAchieving a comprehensive post-2015 development \r\nagenda will above all require a comprehensive framework \r\nfor its financing, among other means of implementation. \r\nIt is clear that the current financing and investment \r\npatterns will not deliver on the Goals. To achieve the \r\nSDGs, it is important that we increase and rationalize \r\noverseas development assistance and financial f lows, \r\nas well as mobilizing new and additional resources for \r\ndeveloping countries, including SIDS, from multiple \r\nsources. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted \r\nat the third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, has laid the foundation for strong \r\nsupport to the realization of the SDGs. Its inclusion \r\nin the means of implementation provides concrete \r\ndeliverables that set the tone for the process. And we \r\nparticularly welcome the annual high-level meeting \r\nof the Economic and Social Council on financing for \r\ndevelopment, aimed at reviewing the outcomes of the \r\nConference and the means of implementation for the \r\npost-2015 agenda.\r\nWe also note with satisfaction the convening by \r\nthe Secretary-General of an inter-agency task force to \r\nreport on progress on both financing for development \r\nand the SDGs. Mauritius greatly appreciates the \r\nestablishment of a technology facilitation mechanism, \r\ndesigned to identify technology needs and gaps and \r\nfacilitate the dissemination and transfer of technology \r\nrelevant to the SDGs. That is crucial for my country, \r\nsince the next phase of our socioeconomic development \r\nwill be driven by technology and innovation.\r\nThe achievement of the SDGs will require close \r\ncollaboration between Governments, the private sector \r\nand civil society. The contribution of international \r\norganizations and multinational companies, with their \r\nworldwide reach, cutting-edge technologies and massive \r\ncapacity to reach large-scale solutions, is essential \r\nto success. The SDGs will require an unprecedented \r\nmobilization of global knowledge operating across \r\nmany sectors and regions.\r\nMy Government is fully committed to implementing \r\nthe 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, and we \r\nurge the international community to support developing \r\ncountries so that they can deliver. It is with great hope \r\nand expectations that Mauritius endorses the document.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister, \r\nMinister of Defence and Home Affairs, Minister of \r\n15-29253 25/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nRodrigues and National Development Unit of the \r\nRepublic of Mauritius for his statement.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Turkey.\r\nMr. Ahmet Davutoğlu, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nMr. Davutoğlu (Turkey): We have gathered to \r\ncelebrate a historic event, as we adopt an ambitious and \r\nuniversal sustainable development agenda. Together, we \r\nare making a pledge to transform the world for the better \r\nin the next decade and a half. Humankind faces complex \r\nand interlinked challenges. Continuing poverty, ever-\r\ndeepening inequalities, climate change and other forms \r\nof environmental degradation, global health threats, \r\nspiralling conflict, violent extremism, terrorism and \r\nthe consequent humanitarian crises — including the \r\ndisplacement of unprecedented numbers of people \r\nseeking refuge — threaten our well-being and our \r\nplanet’s future. On the eve of the new millennium, we \r\nagreed on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nSince the adoption of the MDGs, significant progress \r\nhas been made to reach those Goals. Unfortunately, \r\nprogress has been uneven among and within countries, \r\nand some of the Goals still remain off-track.\r\nThat is why we must all commit, without reservation, \r\nto the new Global Agenda that we are proclaiming \r\ntoday (resolution 70/1). It is particularly important that \r\nthe 2030 Agenda build upon the achievements of the \r\nMDGs and address the unfinished business. Turkey \r\nstrongly supports the emphasis on providing scaled-up \r\nassistance to the least developed countries and other \r\nmost vulnerable countries. That will help to fulfil our \r\npledge of leaving no one behind.\r\nCrucially, the 2030 Agenda recognizes what we \r\nhave been witnessing for years: sustainable development \r\ncannot be realized without peace and security, and \r\npeace and security will be at risk without sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The humanitarian crisis in the Middle \r\nEast is a case in point, for it is a humanitarian tragedy \r\ncaused by oppression, as well as lack of security and \r\nstability. We are hosting more than 2 million Syrians \r\nin Turkey, 960,000 of whom are children. For those \r\ninterested in the facts, 66,000 Syrian babies have been \r\nborn in camps in Turkey. Our country has spent almost \r\n8 billion dollars for the refugees in camps, with a very \r\nmodest contribution from the international community.\r\nWe cannot reach our Sustainable Development \r\nGoals without first addressing complex humanitarian \r\nemergencies. That is why a greater emphasis on the \r\nhumanitarian-development nexus is strongly needed. \r\nAnd that is why Turkish humanitarian diplomacy \r\ncombines humanitarian and development assistance \r\nprogrammes within a collective strategy, with an eye to \r\nthe countries in sub-Saharan Africa, in particular. The \r\nWorld Humanitarian Summit will be held in Istanbul \r\non 23 and 24 May 2016 and will provide an excellent \r\nopportunity to assess the degree of coherence between \r\nfinancing for humanitarian assistance and financing \r\nfor development assistance.\r\nTurkey will also host the eighth meeting of the \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development in October \r\nthis year. There we will discuss the implementation of \r\nthe migration-related targets and indicators included \r\nin the Sustainable Development Goals. The new \r\nAgenda supports the implementation of the relevant \r\nprogrammes of action, including the Programme \r\nof Action for the Least Developed Countries. As the \r\nco-Chair of the Group of Friends of Least Developed \r\nCountries, Turkey will continue its strong support to \r\nthe least developed countries.\r\nWe will host the mid-term review meeting of the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action in June of 2016. We count \r\non the support of United Nations Member States for the \r\nsuccess of this meeting. Turkey has also offered to host \r\nthe proposed Technology Bank for Least Developed \r\nCountries and the science, technology and innovation \r\nsupporting mechanism dedicated to those countries. \r\nWe are looking forward to the report of the High-level \r\nPanel of Experts, which will advise on organizational \r\nand operational aspects of the proposed Technology \r\nBank.\r\nThe real measure of our success with respect to the \r\nnew and ambitious Development Agenda will be the \r\nconcrete steps we take in the implementation phase. \r\nThat is why there must be a paradigm shift, in order to \r\nunlock the resources needed to finance the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The 2030 Agenda provides some \r\nof the answers to that question, by incorporating \r\ncertain necessary means of implementation. Those \r\nmeans are complemented by the Addis Ababa Action \r\n26/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nAgenda, which was adopted at the Third Conference \r\non Financing for Development. The outcome of the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, to be held in Paris in December, will \r\nadd another link to the chain. Those three outcome \r\ndocuments will establish the framework of the Global \r\nDevelopment Agenda for the next 15 years.\r\nCombating climate change and achieving \r\nsustainable development are closely linked. We, in \r\nTurkey, will integrate the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and targets into our national development plans.\r\nWith respect to the Group of 20 (G-20), Turkey has \r\nplaced development at the centre of its G-20 presidency \r\nagenda for 2015. Promoting the integration of low-\r\nincome developing countries into the world economy \r\nis one of its top G-20 presidency priorities. We have \r\nworked very hard to ensure close alignment between \r\nthe G-20 agenda and global sustainable development \r\nefforts to end poverty, hunger and inequality and to \r\npromote infrastructure investments, food security, \r\naccess to energy, youth employment, gender equality \r\nand inclusive economic growth, while protecting \r\nthe planet. The G-20 is working to assist low-income \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) remains key \r\nto supporting development efforts in many countries, \r\nparticularly the least developed countries. As an \r\nemerging donor, Turkey has expanded the geographical \r\nscope of its development cooperation and steadily \r\nincreased the amount of its ODA in recent years, which \r\nhas increased from $967 million in 2010 to $3.5 billion \r\nin 2014. That amount corresponds to 0.45 per cent of \r\nour gross national income, and we are committed to \r\nfurther increasing our contributions. Yet, enhanced \r\ncooperation between the public and the private sector \r\nto support sustainable development is also critical. That \r\nis why the Turkish G-20 presidency has made the role \r\nof the private sector in development — with a focus \r\non inclusive business — part of the G-20 development \r\nagenda. We will continue to encourage efforts in that \r\ndirection. At the G-20 Summit that Turkey will host \r\nin Antalya this November, G-20 leaders will discuss in \r\ndetail the Group’s contribution to the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda.\r\nActions speak louder than words. We, the leaders \r\nof nations from across the world, have come together to \r\nadopt the 2030 Agenda in this august setting. It is a very \r\nimportant step that lifts humankind’s hopes for a better \r\nfuture, one in which no one is left behind. Today, we are \r\nmaking a pledge to future generations, and it is only by \r\nworking together that we can honour that pledge. We, \r\nin Turkey, are resolved to make our contribution and to \r\nfulfil our commitment.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I thank the Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Turkey for his statement.\r\nMr. Ahmet Davutoğlu, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: At this point, I should \r\nlike to inform delegations that we will now hear brief \r\npresentations by the co-Chairs of the interactive \r\ndialogues.\r\nI now give the f loor to the co-Chair of interactive \r\ndialogue I, His Excellency Mr. Miro Cerar, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Cerar (co-Chair of interactive dialogue I): I \r\nhave the honour to present, on behalf of Mr. Ralph E. \r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, and myself, the summary of deliberations \r\nfrom interactive dialogue I, on ending poverty and \r\nhunger.\r\nWe noted that ending poverty is a matter of human \r\ndignity. The Millennium Development Goals were an \r\nimportant catalyst for the significant progress made in \r\nreducing poverty and hunger globally. However, that \r\nprogress has been deeply uneven. Too many are still \r\npoor and undernourished, and poverty persists in every \r\ncountry. Eradicating poverty and hunger and leaving no \r\none behind will require a multidimensional perspective \r\nthat addresses their social, economic and environmental \r\ndrivers. We must also tackle inequality and systemic \r\nand structural issues. Ending poverty and hunger can \r\nbe achieved only by addressing interconnected factors \r\nsuch as inclusive growth, livelihoods and employment, \r\naccess to basic infrastructure and services, food \r\nsecurity, nutrition, health care, education, greater \r\nequality, improved agricultural productivity and the \r\nsustainable use of natural resources. We also highlight \r\nthe important role of social protection schemes.\r\nEconomic growth is necessary but not sufficient if \r\nwe are to accelerate the reduction of poverty and hunger. \r\nFuture prosperity will also require that economic \r\ngrowth no longer degrades the environment. Climate \r\nchange must be halted. We emphasize the importance \r\nof national ownership and political commitment, \r\n15-29253 27/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\ncitizen engagement, effective fiscal policies, an \r\nintegrated and coherent approach to policymaking, \r\nadequate resources, the monitoring of progress, \r\nand accountability and transparency. We also need \r\nincreased participation in global decision-making by \r\ndeveloping countries. There is a need for financing and \r\ninvestment from a range of actors, including national \r\nand regional development banks, the private sector \r\nand other institutional investors, such as pension funds \r\nand insurance companies. It is also important to raise \r\nadditional resources through, for example, improved \r\nnational tax systems and innovative financing sources.\r\nInvesting in the health and education of women and \r\ngirls is crucial. Employment and inclusion for young \r\npeople should receive priority attention. Marginalized \r\ngroups should be included in decision-making processes. \r\nPeaceful and just societies are a necessary precondition \r\nfor sustainable development. Many conflicts are \r\ndriven by poverty, hunger and hopelessness. We noted \r\nthat reversals in development gains could be avoided \r\nby building resilience to shocks and disasters and \r\nwill require appropriate risk-management plans and \r\nstrategies, together with strong social-protection \r\nframeworks. Lastly, we stressed the importance of \r\nstrengthening the global partnership for development \r\nat both the national and international levels.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now give the f loor to the \r\nco-Chair of interactive dialogue II, Her Excellency \r\nMs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia.\r\nPresident Grabar-Kitarović (co-Chair of \r\ninteractive dialogue II): On behalf of President Uhuru \r\nKenyatta of Kenya and myself, I have the honour to \r\npresent the summary of deliberations from interactive \r\ndialogue II, on tackling inequalities, empowering \r\nwomen and girls and leaving no one behind.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) calls unprecedented attention to the \r\nneed to reduce inequalities both within and among \r\nnations. Only by doing so can we build a world that \r\nis more just, stable and peaceful. We agreed that \r\ntranslating the Agenda’s Goals and targets into national \r\npolicies and programmes is a commitment that will \r\nmobilize us all for the next 15 years.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda is ambitious. It encompasses \r\nall human rights and aims to eliminate all forms of \r\ndiscrimination. We recognized that the Goals cannot be \r\nachieved unless progress includes everyone, especially \r\nwomen, who make up half of the world’s population. \r\nAddressing gender equality is key and will have a \r\nmultiplier effect in achieving all the Goals. While \r\nacknowledging the significant progress that has been \r\nmade in advancing gender equality, our discussions \r\nhighlighted some of the areas that will need further \r\naction.\r\nFirst, universal access to quality education for \r\ngirls must be reached through every means possible \r\nin the given time frame. Secondly, women must be \r\ngiven equal opportunities in the economic sphere, \r\nincluding at the workplace. Thirdly, we must ensure \r\ngreater representation of women in political positions \r\nand leadership. Fourthly, violence against women must \r\nbe eliminated and investments made in sexual and \r\nreproductive health.\r\nWe agreed that tackling inequalities requires not \r\njust changes in policies and laws but also strengthened \r\ncapacities and empowerment at the community level. \r\nThe most marginalized, including rural, indigenous, \r\ndisabled and older people, must have equal opportunities \r\nand access to resources, and they must also be given a \r\nvoice. A sustainable world should give every person a \r\nfair chance. The humanitarian crisis that the world is \r\nfacing today, and particularly the situation of migrants \r\nand refugees, reminds us that we must prioritize the \r\nneeds of the most vulnerable. We are all accountable \r\nfor ensuring that the 2030 Agenda is taken forward. \r\nWe need the right data, new technologies and broad \r\npartnerships. Above all, we need sustained political will \r\nif we are to reach our common objective of ensuring \r\ndignity and equal opportunities for all.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I now give the f loor to the \r\nco-Chair of interactive dialogue III, His Excellency \r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nBelgium.\r\nMr. Michel (co-Chair of interactive dialogue III) \r\n(spoke in French): On behalf of Sheikh Hasina, Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, and \r\nmyself, I have the honour to present the summary of \r\ndeliberations from interactive dialogue III, on fostering \r\nviable economic growth and structural transformation \r\nand promoting sustainable modes of consumption and \r\nproduction.\r\nOur discussions affirmed that prosperity has \r\nincreased and many people have emerged from poverty. \r\nHowever, a great deal remains to be done, particularly \r\nfor the world’s most vulnerable. Continuing to reduce \r\n28/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nthe scourge of poverty, tackling the structural causes \r\nof inequalities, increasing access to justice and \r\nrespecting human rights are still major priorities. We \r\nalso highlighted the fact that balanced, viable economic \r\ngrowth is essential to reducing poverty and ensuring \r\nsustainable development. We will have to pursue \r\nthose goals despite the numerous current and future \r\nchallenges facing the world.\r\nWe also recognize that growth without creating \r\njobs, increased inequality of wealth, and unemployment \r\namong young people are concerns all over the world. \r\nPromoting decent jobs, workers’ rights and developing \r\nsocial protections that include a minimum threshold \r\nwould seem to be the keys to just and more inclusive \r\nsocieties. In order for our economies to be inclusive, \r\nwe should also aim at achieving equality between \r\nwomen and men. Investing in women’s health and \r\neducation, eliminating sexual violence and promoting \r\nentrepreneurship for women are essential to achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nStructural and technological reforms to our \r\neconomies are necessary to develop a system of \r\ninternational commerce in which exchanges are more \r\ntechnologically intensive and have greater value added \r\nand more productivity, and where there is full integration \r\nfor everybody. Connectivity and access to the Internet, \r\nas well as the strengthening of institutions, are also \r\nkeys to accelerate this transformation. Strengthening \r\nregional and international trade appears essential for \r\nsustainable development. Access to markets and to \r\ntechnology is fundamental for integration into the global \r\neconomy. We must invest more, particularly in Africa, \r\nin such sectors as renewable energy, infrastructure \r\nand transport and agriculture. We also believe that \r\ndomestic and foreign investment must be stimulated. In \r\nthat regard, new partnerships between the private and \r\npublic sectors should be better defined.\r\nFinally, we must uncouple economic growth, on the \r\none hand, and degradation of the environment, on the \r\nother, and combat climate change so that we can better \r\nprotect future generations. We must accelerate a real \r\ntransition to sustainable lifestyles, which requires that \r\nwe change our consumption patterns and make better \r\nuse of our precious resources.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the two \r\nCo-Chairs of this historic Summit. I would also like \r\nto thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who during \r\nthe entire process has been a driving force and a great \r\ninspiration to us all. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) is now adopted. We need \r\nto get down to work.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now give the f loor to the \r\nco-Chair of interactive dialogue V, Her Excellency \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the Republic \r\nof Chile.\r\nPresident Bachelet Jeria (co-Chair of interactive \r\ndialogue V): On behalf of Her Excellency Ms. Park \r\nGeun-hye, President of the Republic of Korea, and \r\nmyself, I have the honour to present the summary of \r\ndeliberations from interactive dialogue V, on “Building \r\neffective, accountable and inclusive institutions to \r\nachieve sustainable development”.\r\nThere was a strong sentiment during the dialogue \r\nthat effective, accountable and inclusive institutions \r\nthat are transparent and free of corruption are essential \r\nprerequisites for our common vision for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. While Goal 16 is important in its own \r\nright, it facilitates and accelerates the success of all the \r\nother Goals.\r\nWe agreed that the increased involvement of \r\ncitizens is needed in order to create full ownership \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). That can be achieved only through \r\nhigh-quality education, non-discrimination, gender \r\nequality and access to justice and information, as well \r\nas reliable and timely data, and it must include the most \r\nvulnerable and marginalized groups. It should uphold \r\nthe highest standards of human rights and freedoms. \r\nThe full engagement of citizens will also help to build a \r\nbridge between the poor and the rich, men and women, \r\nurban and rural constituencies and provide an enabling \r\nenvironment for all people. That will be essential \r\nin promoting integrity and building trust between \r\nGovernments and citizens.\r\nWe acknowledge that strong institutions based \r\non the rule of law are essential for building peaceful \r\nsocieties where people live free from fear and want. \r\nA culture of justice needs to be created and upheld to \r\nempower all people, including the most marginalized. \r\nA precondition for the implementation of Goal 16 and \r\nall other Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is the \r\nbreaking down of silos through building partnership \r\nacross sectors and among all stakeholders.\r\nWe concur that the SDGs must be integrated into \r\nnational plans and strategies, supported by sound \r\n15-29253 29/30\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.11\r\nmonitoring and review frameworks. The important \r\nrole of Parliaments and local authorities needs to be \r\nrecognized and enhanced. Partnerships and a stable \r\nenvironment provided through strong institutions are \r\nnecessary for vibrant private-sector engagement and \r\ndomestic and international resource mobilization. Full \r\ngender equality needs to be achieved and women’s \r\npotential must be unlocked.\r\nYoung people are the prime beneficiaries of \r\npeaceful States and societies. Children and youth living \r\nin conflict are often the most immediate victims of \r\nviolence and displacement. We owe it to them to create \r\na peaceful, just and prosperous world.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdoulaye Balde, Minister of \r\nEnvironment and Sustainable Development of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal and representative of the co-Chair \r\nof interactive dialogue VI.\r\nMr. Balde (co-Chair of interactive dialogue \r\nVI) (spoke in French): On behalf of Mr. Macky Sall, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and of Mr. Ahmet \r\nDavutoğlu, Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, I \r\nhave the honour to present the summary of interactive \r\ndialogue VI, entitled “Delivering on a revitalized global \r\npartnership”.\r\nThe discussions on the topic of partnership \r\ntook place in a friendly environment, with relevant \r\nrecommendations regarding the following convergent \r\npoints.\r\nIn noting that reaching the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals will depend on a revitalized global partnership, \r\nwe agreed that it should be universal and relevant for \r\nall, while meeting the needs of the most vulnerable and \r\nin leaving no one behind. All the stakeholders must \r\nbe committed, and the needs of present and future \r\ngenerations taken into account. We emphasized the \r\nneed to mobilize financial resources — public and \r\nprivate, national and international — and technologies, \r\nas well as the need to strengthen capacity-building for \r\nsustainable development.\r\nOfficial development assistance (ODA) remains \r\ncritical, in particular for the poorest and most \r\nvulnerable countries. A major role will be played \r\nby the mobilization of national resources, the \r\nstrengthening of international cooperation in fiscal \r\nmatters and combating illicit financial f lows, as well \r\nas by viable policies, private investment and effective \r\npartnerships. We called for immediate compliance with \r\nour commitments regarding ODA and in other areas. \r\nWe also emphasized the importance of development \r\ncooperation that will be effective, predictable, country-\r\nspecific and results-based.\r\nWe agreed that consistent policies with regard to \r\nfinancing, trade, debt and technology were necessary \r\nfor sustainable development. We emphasized the \r\nimportance of good governance and the rule of law, of \r\na healthy environment and the fight against corruption, \r\nas well as independence for women and girls, without \r\nforgetting young people.\r\nMindful that we have to adapt the global objectives \r\nto the local level, we emphasized the need to take them \r\ninto account in concrete national development plans, \r\nelaborated after open consultations with civil society, \r\nin order to guide national policies and international \r\ncooperation for development. The capacities of local \r\nstakeholders must be strengthened, and access to \r\nfinancial services broadened.\r\nWe also highlighted the contributions of regional \r\ninstitutions, which are a framework for exchanging \r\nexperiences and know-how. We agreed on the need to \r\nestablish innovate partnerships among Governments, \r\nbusiness and civil society so as to benefit from all \r\nresources and skills available. We recognized that \r\npublic policy and public finance can contribute to \r\nthe mobilization of private investment favouring the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. We also stressed \r\nthe importance of accessible and transparent data to \r\nensure the follow-up of progress, the assessment of \r\npolicies and the accountability of all stakeholders. We \r\nemphasized the need to adopt innovative, effective and \r\ninclusive approaches for follow-up and evaluation. We \r\nmust mobilize all stakeholders and create a space which \r\nis conducive to the participation of civil society, while \r\nencouraging mutual learning in our common activities \r\nin implementing the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThat is a summary of the main ideas that we thought \r\nwe should present as conclusions or recommendations \r\nfrom our work.\r\nCo-Chair Rasmussen: We will now move to the \r\nlast brief presentation of the interactive dialogues. \r\nI would like to take the opportunity to thank all the \r\nco-Chairs for their great work.\r\n30/30 15-29253\r\nA/70/PV.11 27/09/2015\r\nI give the f loor to the co-Chair of interactive \r\ndialogue IV, His Excellency Mr. Ollanta Humala Tasso, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru.\r\nPresident Humala Tasso (co-Chair of interactive \r\ndialogue IV) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of His \r\nExcellency Mr. François Hollande, President of the \r\nFrench Republic, and on my own behalf, I have the \r\nhonour to present a summary of deliberations that \r\ntook place during interactive dialogue IV, entitled \r\n“Protecting our planet and combating climate change”.\r\nClimate change is one of our major challenges. The \r\nnegative impacts of climate change are challenging \r\ndevelopment and the possibilities of progress in all \r\nareas of our economies and societies. In order to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, we must ensure \r\na high level of consistency between the responses to \r\nclimate change and the eradication of poverty. We need \r\nintegrated actions for the sustainable use of natural \r\nresources and the management of the biodiversity of \r\nour forests, land, mountains, oceans and seas. Only \r\nin that way will we be able to respond to the growing \r\ndemand for food, water and energy. It is essential to \r\nensure that women, indigenous peoples and other \r\nvulnerable groups have equitable access to land, forests \r\nand fisheries, among other things.\r\nIt is essential to ensure that we be able to limit the \r\nincrease of the temperature to between 1.5°C and 2°C. \r\nThe only way to limit the increase in temperature is \r\nthrough decarbonizing the economy. That must be a \r\npriority in those countries with the highest emissions \r\nof greenhouse gasses. Transition towards renewable \r\nenergy sources is particularly important for improving \r\nefficiency in the way we use energy and natural \r\nresources.\r\nWe heard very clearly the magnitude of \r\nvulnerability to which developing countries are \r\nexposed — countries such as Peru, but primarily the \r\nsmall island developing States and the least developed \r\ncountries. The losses incurred because of the increase \r\nin the frequency and violence of natural disasters have \r\nhigh costs for our populations and the economies of our \r\ncountries. Adapting to climate change requires a greater \r\ninternational effort in the form of financial resources, \r\nthe transfer of sustainable and clean technologies, and \r\ncapacity-building. Greater international cooperation \r\nmust be geared primarily towards the least developed \r\ncountries and small island developing States. We \r\nmust strengthen the contributions of all stakeholders, \r\nspecifically the private sector, at all levels — the \r\nglobal, regional and national — and, as far as possible, \r\nestablish a carbon price to guide investment decisions \r\ntowards low-carbon economies.\r\nSeveral countries reported that they had ambitious \r\nnational plans to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions \r\nand to mitigate the impact of climate change. The \r\npresentation of those plans by all countries before the \r\nParis Conference will be a good sign for the negotiations \r\nthat we will conclude in the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nin December in Paris. We have high expectations for \r\nthe outcome of COP21. We were able to conclude that \r\nthe general will is to reach a global, ambitious and \r\nlegally binding agreement, with the goal of limiting the \r\ntemperature increase to between 1.5°C and 2°C. That \r\nwill be the acid test of our collective commitment as \r\nnations and societies towards achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nI believe that today humankind has before it an \r\nopportunity to build the biggest and most powerful \r\npartnership in the planet’s history in the fight against \r\nclimate change and rising temperatures.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
