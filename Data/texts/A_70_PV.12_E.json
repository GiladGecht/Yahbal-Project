Now we \r\nstand here again to review what we have achieved and \r\nwhat we still have to do to make our common ambition \r\na reality. Despite the undeniable progress achieved, \r\nasymmetries persist across regions and countries. As \r\nwe speak, some 800 million people are still living in \r\nextreme poverty. They have been left behind.\r\nWe salute the Assembly’s adoption of the \r\nrevolutionary, comprehensive and inclusive 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), aimed at ensuring a prosperous and decent life \r\nfor all. Slovakia would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the President of the General Assembly and the \r\nco-facilitators for their hard work to reach a balanced \r\noutcome document. Slovakia was actively involved in \r\nthe preparatory process, both as a contributor to the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and as a member of the Intergovernmental \r\nCommittee of Experts on Sustainable Development \r\nFinancing, which paved the way for the adoption of \r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda. We commend and \r\nsupport all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \r\nThey build on the millennium priorities of poverty \r\neradication, prosperity and gender equality, but they \r\nalso include new and relevant key factors of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, on which I would like to elaborate.\r\nFirst, one of the crucial lessons we learned from the \r\nMillennium Development Goals was that they focused \r\nmostly on statistical targets of poverty reduction \r\nwhile insisting less on creating socioeconomic \r\nconditions, infrastructure, addressing global threats to \r\ndevelopment and forging an enabling environment to \r\nsupport these objectives. Slovakia considers all those \r\naspects — including the rule of law, good governance \r\nand inclusive institutions — to be equally important \r\nand fundamental. We consider security-sector reform \r\na parameter relevant to the achievement of Goal 16, \r\non peaceful and inclusive societies. The absence of an \r\nenabling environment can have a negative impact on \r\nmany Sustainable Development Goals, such as those \r\nconcerning gender equality, women’s empowerment \r\nand inclusive economic growth.\r\nSecondly, the new Agenda lays out more specific \r\ntargets on the preservation of the environment and the \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.12\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n12th plenary meeting\r\nSunday, 27 September 2015, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/11 15-29259\r\nA/70/PV.12 27/09/2015\r\nsustainable management of natural resources. A clear set \r\nof environmental goals should create critical momentum \r\nand pave the way for a successful Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, in Paris. We are on the right path. \r\nThirdly, Slovakia supports a revitalized global \r\npartnership, as proposed in Goal 17. We are eager to \r\nbuild on the positive results from MDG 8, such as \r\nthe principles of the Busan Partnership for Effective \r\nDevelopment Cooperation and its voluntary initiatives.\r\nAs we discussed in Addis Ababa, official \r\ndevelopment assistance remains vital to the \r\ndevelopment of many countries. At the same time, \r\nthe mobilization of all domestic resources is one of \r\nthe crucial elements in addressing national contexts. \r\nThat is where Slovakia sees its biggest contribution to \r\ndevelopment, through sharing its know-how on fiscal \r\nreform and tax collection. A new global partnership \r\nalso means inclusive cooperation with all stakeholders, \r\nincluding those in civil society and the private sector.\r\nThe SDGs must be implemented at two levels: \r\nglobally, through coordinated and inclusive cooperation, \r\nand individually, through domestically implemented \r\nstrategies. Every Member State must be involved and \r\nmust participate and contribute to the extent that its \r\nown regional and national capacities permit. Joint \r\naction and individual responsibility are keys to success.\r\nFinally, we need a systematic follow-up and review \r\nmechanism at the national, regional and global levels, \r\nbased on balanced and smart indicators. The High-level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development could \r\nbe well positioned to oversee the implementation of \r\nthe Agenda at the global level in order to preserve its \r\nuniversal character.\r\nIn the face of one of the biggest challenges for \r\nhumankind, all our efforts will be void if we are not \r\ndetermined to go well beyond our political discourse. \r\nWe have to be courageous in putting the Agenda above \r\nour collective and individual interests. Mahatma \r\nGandhi’s wisdom tells us that strength does not come \r\nfrom physical capacity. It comes from an indomitable \r\nwill. Let us therefore not waste this unique momentum \r\nand opportunity to bring real and sustainable change \r\nbetween now and 2030 and beyond. Let us board \r\nthis train to prosperity and peace on time. But most \r\nimportant, let us make sure that on the common journey \r\nof humankind, no one is left behind.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now call on the Minister \r\nfor Socioeconomic Planning of the Republic of the \r\nPhilippines.\r\nMr. Balisacan (Philippines): The 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development that we have adopted \r\n(resolution 70/1) embodies our peoples’ aspirations for \r\nthe next 15 years. Its 17 Goals and 169 targets build on \r\nthe unfinished business of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and on recognition of the interlinkages of the \r\nenvironmental, social and economic challenges facing \r\nus today. The inclusive consultation process was both \r\nan opportunity to build a shared global vision for the \r\nfuture we want and a venue for amplifying the voices of \r\nthe poor and of the marginalized sectors. \r\nWe are especially encouraged by the inclusion \r\nin the 2030 Agenda of the issues of migration, \r\nvulnerabilities, collective action for conservation and \r\ninequalities of opportunity. The Philippines advocated \r\nthat the Agenda recognize the positive contributions \r\nof migrants to sustainable development in countries \r\nof origin, transit and destination. We call on Member \r\nStates to mainstream migration in the development \r\nprocess, reduce remittance costs and fully respect the \r\nhuman rights of migrants.\r\nIf we are to achieve our development goals, we \r\nneed to take urgent action to combat climate change. \r\nWe have seen extreme weather disturbances occurring \r\nwith greater frequency and intensity. Those calamities \r\ncan negate our gains in reducing poverty, and they \r\ncan even roll back development. We therefore need to \r\nput in place climate-change adaptation and mitigation \r\nmeasures, particularly at the local levels, and increase \r\ninvestments in a climate-resilient economy. In line \r\nwith that, we aim to ensure financial inclusion for all, \r\nparticularly through access to insurance and capital \r\nand through mobile financing.\r\nAs President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum and \r\nas one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, \r\nwe will also work at the upcoming Paris Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change to ensure that we \r\nadopt a new, legally binding climate agreement that is \r\nuniversal and equitable and that will limit the increase \r\nin the global average temperature to below 2°C or \r\n1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In that regard, the \r\nPhilippines appreciates the emphasis placed in Goal 14 \r\non the need to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, \r\nseas and marine resources. Enshrining that as a global \r\n15-29259 3/11\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.12\r\nagenda obliges the community of nations to seriously \r\nacknowledge challenges to conservation, such as \r\ndestruction due to massive reclamation, as a common \r\nconcern. Those challenges need to be collectively \r\naddressed using a rules-based approach in international \r\nlaw, as reflected in the United Nations Conference \r\non the Law of the Sea. The call for solidarity puts \r\ninto words the pervasive consciousness on how local \r\nincidents impact worldwide events.\r\nThere is no true development if inequalities arising \r\nfrom the lack of access to opportunities for the most \r\nvulnerable remain. We aspire to achieve education \r\nfor all, universal health coverage, food security and \r\nsocial and economic inclusion, supported by quality \r\ninfrastructure. We are mindful of the pressing need to \r\naddress maternal and reproductive health, including \r\naccess to sexual and reproductive health services, and \r\nto further accelerate the fulfilment of women’s rights.\r\nUndoubtedly, realizing the global Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals will require financial and technical \r\nresources. We therefore seek partnerships for capacity-\r\nbuilding, developing technology and expertise, \r\nexpanding our access to resources for domestic resource \r\nmobilization, leveraging private-sector participation \r\nand achieving resiliency.\r\nAs the 2030 Agenda pledges that no one will be left \r\nbehind, there is also a demand for official statistics to \r\nbe more disaggregated, frequent, timely and accessible. \r\nWe therefore emphasize the need for capacity-building \r\nto strengthen statistical agencies. We call on the \r\ninternational community for increased technical and \r\nfinancial support in that regard.\r\nThis Summit is merely the beginning. To move \r\nforward to achieve the Agenda’s overarching goal \r\nof eradicating poverty, we must now develop our \r\nnational plans and budgets for its implementation and \r\nmonitoring. In doing so, we will collaborate with civil \r\nsociety and all stakeholders, in line with the principle \r\nof inclusiveness and accountability. The Philippines \r\npledges to make the 2030 Agenda a reality and to leave \r\nno one behind. It is our sacred responsibility to our \r\nchildren and to future generations, and our solemn duty \r\nas Members of the United Nations.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now call on the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Portugal.\r\nMr. Machete (Portugal) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): This historic \r\nmoment, coinciding with the celebration of the United \r\nNations seventieth anniversary, represents a major \r\nturning point in the way we perceive development. \r\nFifteen years ago, world leaders came together in this \r\ncity to create an unprecedented multilateral agreement \r\nin response to global challenges, embodied in the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. It is important to \r\nrecognize that much has been accomplished since \r\nthen, but much still remains to be done. That requires \r\na renewed determination from us all, while considering \r\nthe lessons learned from the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and from the world’s \r\ndevelopment landscape.\r\nPortugal views the adoption of the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals as an unparalleled agreement in \r\npromoting sustainable development and the eradication \r\nof poverty and envisioning a world where all human \r\nrights are fully respected. For that reason, I would like \r\nto commend the United Nations and to express my deep \r\nappreciation to all those who participated in this major \r\nnegotiating process.\r\nToday’s world challenges — such as climate \r\nchange, epidemics and the dramatic situation that \r\nmigrants and refugees are facing daily, putting their \r\nlives at risk — are proof positive that it is not possible \r\nto think of our own welfare and security individually or \r\naccording to geographic divides. The universality of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) is therefore paramount. It embodies true shared \r\nresponsibilities in the search for a better future, beyond \r\nthe traditional and outdated North-South approach, \r\nthe division between public and private actors, and the \r\nunderstanding that official development assistance is \r\nthe one and only response to our common challenges.\r\nToday there exists a multiplicity of different \r\nactors whose capacity to contribute can and should \r\nbe enhanced. Among them, emerging economies and \r\ncountries with a growing weight as donors should be \r\ntaking on accrued responsibilities according to their \r\npolitical, economic and financial capacities. The \r\nAgenda also requires from all of us a qualitative and \r\nresults-based approach, geared towards greater policy \r\nefficiency and coherence at all levels.\r\nThis is definitively a time of celebration, but \r\nalso of great responsibility. It is now time to shape \r\nthe new international cooperation paradigm and to \r\nimplement the commitments contained therein. The \r\nUnited Nations must continue to play an essential role \r\nin addressing these global challenges. Nevertheless, \r\nit is up to us — Member States, multilateral agencies, \r\n4/11 15-29259\r\nA/70/PV.12 27/09/2015\r\nParliaments, local authorities, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector — to take ownership and to implement \r\nand follow up on these 17 Goals. Within this \r\nframework, it is essential to consider the challenges \r\nfaced by fragile States — least developed countries, \r\nthe African continent and small island developing \r\nStates — in implementing the Goals. They require our \r\nspecial attention.\r\nFor those reasons, Portugal has subscribed to \r\nthe European Union commitments made at the third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \r\nat Addis Ababa, including that to collectively mobilize \r\n0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of our gross national \r\nincome for official development assistance to the least \r\ndeveloped countries and to prioritize aid to the African \r\ncontinent.\r\nPortugal’s development cooperation focuses on \r\nstrengthening the links among peace, security and \r\nsustainable development. That approach will continue \r\nto be an absolute priority for us. To achieve that \r\ngoal, we have accorded special focus on sectors with \r\nstructuring and multiplying effects on sustainable \r\ndevelopment, such as governance, the rule of law, \r\nhuman rights, education, health and institutional \r\ncapacity-building, as well as the adoption of measures \r\naimed at empowering women and girls and eradicating \r\nall forms of gender-based violence. Portugal has also \r\npursued significant investments in renewable energies \r\nand “blue growth”, with a special focus on protecting \r\nour environment, biodiversity, and seas and oceans, \r\nwhile simultaneously aiming at integrating the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development.\r\nPortugal believes that the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda will have to be pursued in true partnership. \r\nWe will therefore continue to work with and involve \r\ncivil society and local authorities in implementing the \r\ncommitments that we have undertaken at this Summit. \r\nWe are ready to work in partnership with our fellow \r\nmembers of the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries to integrate the 2030 Agenda in its work, and \r\nwe stand ready to do so as well in other multilateral \r\nforums in which we participate.\r\nWe have come a long way since negotiations on \r\nthis Agenda began. We are now at the starting point of \r\na new chapter. I would like to conclude by reiterating \r\nPortugal’s full support for this new Agenda and for \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations. \r\nWe remain convinced that only by joining efforts, \r\npromoting economic and social progress and practicing \r\ntolerance will we live in peace.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now give the f loor to the \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Principality of \r\nAndorra.\r\nMr. Saboya Sunyé (Andorra) (spoke in French): \r\nI would like, first of all, to welcome the co-Chairs of \r\nthis Summit and to thank the co-facilitators for the \r\nambitious final document we adopted earlier (resolution \r\n70/1). “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development” includes 17 Goals and 169 \r\ntargets agreed on the basis of outstanding participatory \r\nwork of inclusive and thoughtful dialogue. None of \r\nus can today remain on the sidelines of this great step \r\nforward.\r\nLike today, 15 years ago we committed, through \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, to promoting \r\ngreater dignity and equality of all human beings. That \r\ncommitment led us to an unprecedented advance. But \r\nwhile we recognize that unprecedented progress, we \r\ncannot allow ourselves to fall today into complacency. \r\nIt must be acknowledged that progress has been uneven, \r\nand in some aspects it has even been insufficient. That \r\nis why we must recommit ourselves today with greater \r\nintensity and with more demanding goals. To enjoy a \r\ndignified life, hunger and extreme poverty in the world \r\nmust be brought to an end. A dignified life for us and \r\nfuture generations cannot come about without equality \r\nor without security, nor can it be without democracy \r\nor respect for human rights. These are key aspects \r\nof a healthy and sustainable environment for future \r\ngenerations.\r\nThe tragedies that we are witnessing every day \r\naround the world — especially on the African continent, \r\nbut also at the borders of Europe, with a refugee crisis \r\nthat deserves not only our complete attention but also our \r\ncomplete solidarity and participation in the welcoming \r\neffort — are still too serious and too numerous. They \r\nare inadmissible.\r\n(spoke in Spanish) \r\nWe are convinced that the education of our young \r\npeople, particularly civics education favouring the \r\npromotion of human rights and democracy, is our best \r\nweapon to combat intolerance and to promote equal \r\nopportunity and social cohesion. Therefore, education \r\nis a national priority in Andorra, with free and open \r\naccess to three public education systems — Andorran, \r\n15-29259 5/11\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.12\r\nFrench and Spanish, one of the peculiarities of our \r\nsmall country. \r\nBut education is also a priority in our foreign \r\npolicy. Andorra spends more than 20 per cent of \r\nits development cooperation budget on education \r\nprojects. Andorra has also been invited by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon — to whom I wish to express \r\nour gratitude again here today — to join the Global \r\nEducation First Initiative. Furthermore, during the \r\nAndorran chairmanship of the Committee of Ministers \r\nof the Council of Europe, the theme “Education for \r\nDemocratic Citizenship” was our priority. Andorra is \r\nthus making special efforts to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals relating to education and \r\nchildhood. Similarly, and for their cross-cutting aspect, \r\nwe pay particular attention to gender equality and the \r\nprotection of the human rights of the most vulnerable \r\ngroups.\r\nFinally, as a country nestled in a natural environment \r\nof great value and which receives 8 million visitors each \r\nyear, we are particularly sensitive to this asset, which \r\nentails the protection of our environment. Therefore, \r\nthe new Government has a Ministry of Environment, \r\nAgriculture and Sustainable Development, which \r\nis putting forward, in cooperation with the various \r\nministries, institutions and social agents, a cross-\r\ncutting and inclusive vision for our participation at the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. That summit, to be held in Paris at the end of \r\nthis year, will be essential for the proper development \r\nof the Goals that we have just adopted. Andorra has \r\nalready submitted its contribution.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAll the Goals that we have discussed and agreed \r\ntogether are a real global commitment, but they may not \r\nbe achievable if they are not backed by strong political \r\nwill and a strategy for following up on and reviewing \r\ntheir implementation. The adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, together with the \r\ncelebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, must today be the starting point for a common \r\neffort with the ambition to transform our world into a \r\nplace where all human beings can live in dignity. \r\nWe cannot leave anyone behind. This must be our \r\ncommitment today. It has to be our ambition. It is our \r\nresponsibility for the future.\r\nAs Mr. Juncker said a few weeks ago about \r\nthe European Union, there must be more national \r\ncommitments in United Nations initiatives and more \r\nUnited Nations commitments in our national initiatives. \r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now call on the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. \r\nMr. Ri Su Yong (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea) (spoke in Korean; interpretation provided by \r\nthe delegation): As we mark the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the founding of the United Nations, the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), which reflects the will and desire of \r\nthe broad-based membership of the United Nations, \r\nis a meaningful event in United Nations history. The \r\npost-2015 development agenda we have adopted is \r\nthe product of strenuous efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to eradicate poverty and to achieve \r\nsustainable development worldwide.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals, adopted \r\n15 years ago, made a positive contribution to promoting \r\ncooperation among countries and regions in all fields \r\nof socioeconomic development. However, we still have \r\na long way to go to completely liberate humankind \r\nfrom poverty and build a free, peaceful and prosperous \r\nworld. With that in mind, we have adopted the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which contains \r\nmore specific goals to reshape and transform the world.\r\nIn order to achieve the Goals for the complete \r\neradication of poverty and for sustainable socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, a peaceful and durable environment \r\nfor development should have priority. As is generally \r\nknown, some specific countries are creating artificial \r\nobstacles in the peaceful resolution of international \r\nproblems and the sound and sustainable development \r\nof countries and regions — including sanctions in an \r\nattempt to achieve their military and political objectives.\r\nIf the economic sanctions imposed in medieval \r\nfashion against the independent aspirations of \r\ndeveloping countries are left intact, the excellent \r\ndevelopment goals that we set will not be achieved. A \r\ntypical example is the United States of America, which \r\nconstantly tries to suppress every sector of our people’s \r\nlives by resorting to all means. This proceeds from its \r\ninveterate animosity and hostile policy to eradicate the \r\nsocialist system of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea. However, what the United States of America \r\n6/11 15-29259\r\nA/70/PV.12 27/09/2015\r\ndoes not know is that the more remorseless the sanctions \r\nmanoeuvres against the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea become, the stronger the will and spirit of our \r\npeople will be, growing a thousandfold to defend more \r\nresolutely the prosperous and powerful socialist State, \r\ncentred on the popular masses.\r\nUnder the wise leadership of the respected \r\nComrade Kim Jong Un, our people are now making \r\nunprecedented great achievements in their endeavours \r\nfor sustainable socioeconomic development, while \r\nrecently overcoming the unscrupulous sanctions and all \r\nother challenges on the way forward. We are striving to \r\nprovide our people with more abundant and civilized \r\nlife by giving high priority to science and technology \r\nand by making maximum use of the potential of our \r\nself-reliant economy. That effort of ours will make a due \r\ncontribution to achieving the Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for the reform and transformation of \r\nthe world. We will vigorously promote equal and \r\nbeneficial economic cooperation, in collaboration with \r\nmany countries around the world, and actively join \r\nin the international trend to translate the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment Agenda into practice.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now call on the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Australia.\r\nMs. Bishop (Australia): When Australia signed \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations 70 years ago, we \r\ncommitted to promoting peace, social progress and \r\nbetter standards of living for the peoples of the world. \r\nAustralia has taken that commitment seriously, and \r\ntoday we are agreeing on a new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) that seeks \r\nto end extreme poverty within a generation. It is an \r\nambitious, bold and necessary objective. Indeed, it \r\nis a global objective, the product of unprecedented \r\nconsultation and negotiation. In the 15 years since the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) were agreed, \r\nwe have made great advances and have lifted hundreds \r\nof millions people out of extreme poverty.\r\nThat achievement should be celebrated. But in \r\nan ever-changing world, new challenges continue to \r\narise. The 2030 Agenda recognizes a more modern, \r\ncontemporary understanding of the drivers of \r\ndevelopment and the changing distribution of global \r\nwealth. The last 15 years have shown us the benefits of \r\nbuilding economic resilience — and so the 2030 Agenda \r\nrightly has a sharp focus on economic growth. Every \r\nsingle resource should be harnessed — so the rights and \r\nopportunities of women and girls are recognized in a \r\nstand-alone goal, and also across the 2030 Agenda.\r\nMany countries that have struggled in their efforts \r\nto achieve the MDGs have experienced instability \r\nand conflict, as we have seen in our region with the \r\nexperience of Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. The \r\nWorld Bank estimates that more than 40 per cent of the \r\nworld’s extreme poor live in conflict-affected and fragile \r\nenvironments. Furthermore, World Bank research \r\npredicts that this percentage will at least double by \r\n2030. Therefore the goal on peace and governance, for \r\nwhich Australia strongly advocated, will be critical for \r\nthe eradication of extreme poverty and for the success \r\nof the entire 2030 Agenda.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals can only ever \r\nbe a statement of ambition unless we plan for how \r\nwe will achieve them. In that regard, we look to the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda, agreed in July. Countries’ \r\ndomestic resources are now the largest source of \r\ndevelopment finance. Australia is pleased to be part \r\nof the Addis Ababa tax initiative to strengthen tax \r\nsystems, and we will double our investment in domestic \r\nresource mobilization by 2020. That builds on the work \r\nof the Group of 20 (G-20) in strengthening national tax \r\nsystems and reducing illicit f lows, as articulated in the \r\nG-20 Summit meeting held in Brisbane last November. \r\nThe private sector, a critical driver of economic growth, \r\njob creation and an important source of development \r\nfinance, has a key role to play. Australia is increasingly \r\npartnering with our private sector, including on projects \r\nto provide access to finance for remote communities in \r\nthe Pacific.\r\nWe have a sharp focus on innovation, investing \r\nin new ways to solve enduring problems and finding \r\ncreative means to overcome seemingly intractable \r\ndevelopment challenges. While the 2030 Agenda is a \r\nmajor achievement, it cannot be the end of our work. \r\nAustralia is committed to taking strong and responsible \r\naction on climate change, and I hope the ambition and \r\nmomentum here in New York carries through to Paris. \r\nIn particular, Australia was integral to the establishment \r\nof the Green Climate Fund, and it remains central to \r\nour efforts on climate change, especially in the Pacific. \r\nAustralia is represented on the Board of the Green \r\nClimate Fund and we have committed $200 million. \r\nOur initial $70 million contribution has been paid.\r\nAustralia is a land of opportunity, prosperity \r\nand inclusiveness. However, like all nations, we face \r\n15-29259 7/11\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.12\r\nchallenges. We are taking action to sustainably manage \r\nour land, forests, waterways and precious marine \r\nresources, including the Great Barrier Reef, a World \r\nHeritage Site that we have committed to preserve and \r\nconserve. We are investing in the skills of our people, \r\ndiversifying our economy and increasing productivity. \r\nWe are taking steps to promote gender equality, close \r\nthe gap on indigenous disadvantage and support those \r\nwith disability, including through a national disability \r\ninsurance scheme.\r\nIn giving effect to the new Agenda, we can \r\nshare lessons from our own experience. Through our \r\ndevelopment programme, engaging with the private \r\nsector and working with partners, we are promoting \r\nprosperity and reducing poverty on a sustainable basis \r\nin the Indo-Pacific region. As Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon has said, the true measure of success is not \r\nhow much we promise, but how much we deliver. It \r\nwill be by working together that we will deliver on the \r\nambition of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now call on the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Algeria. \r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): This \r\nSummit is being held at a sensitive time. There are three \r\nvery important events taking place: the adoption of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, the recent launch \r\nof the Addis Ababa Action Agenda for financing for \r\ndevelopment and the prospect of a global agreement on \r\nclimate change. This Summit offers us an opportunity \r\nto lay the foundations for a renewed global partnership \r\nbased on human well-being, progress and improving \r\nthe welfare the population in the framework of inclusive \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFifteen years ago, with the adoption of the \r\nMillennium Declaration, we launched a new and \r\nambitious era for humankind through our common \r\nand joint action to help the poorest and to give hope to \r\nmillions of people for a better, fairer and more just and \r\nequitable world. We note with satisfaction that, 15 years \r\nafter their adoption and despite some limitations, the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) have provided \r\nfor unprecedented mobilization by the international \r\ncommunity in addressing the challenges related to \r\ndevelopment issues in their manifold facets.\r\nUnder the leadership of President Abdelaziz \r\nBouteflika and in implementing his programme, \r\nAlgeria, which uses the MDGs as a framework for its \r\nnational development, was able to achieve the majority \r\nof the Goals ahead of time, including those concerning \r\nthe eradication of poverty, access to education, the \r\nreduction of infant and maternal mortality and the \r\npromotion of a sustainable environment.\r\nAlgeria has achieved the Goal on the eradication of \r\npoverty, a scourge directly affecting human dignity. In \r\n2013 and 2015, Algeria was recognized by the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations for its \r\nachievements in that area.\r\nSimilarly, Algeria has met, and even exceeded in \r\n2011, the minimum target in terms of universal primary \r\neducation, with a net enrolment rate of 98.16 per cent of \r\nchildren 6 years of age.\r\nAlgeria has modernized its legislation with regard \r\nto gender equality and the empowerment of women. \r\nA law was adopted to ensure greater representation \r\nof women in elected bodies. A new configuration of \r\nthe Algerian Parliament now brings the proportion of \r\nwomen members of Parliament to 31 per cent. This \r\nprogress, and others, ref lects the efforts carried out \r\nby the Algerian State aimed at human, economic and \r\nsocial development. \r\nThese are historic times. The challenges are very \r\ncomplex. Genuine will is needed to overcome the many \r\nobstacles to development. We must assume our common \r\nresponsibilities in order to achieve a better future. \r\nI hope we will work on the basis of our common \r\nawareness and in the interest of our common future. We \r\nmust overcome our selfishness in order to help future \r\ngenerations. We must achieve a better future — one that \r\nis safe and guarantees dignity and prosperity for all. \r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I now call on the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship \r\nof Argentina. \r\nMr. Timerman (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina is pleased about the recent adoption of the \r\ndevelopment Agenda for the next 15 years (resolution \r\n70/1). We are sure it will provide new a new focal \r\npoint for Government action, including with regard to \r\neradicating poverty, improving health and promoting \r\neducation and sustainable development with social \r\ninclusion for all our peoples. \r\nArgentina is proud to be among the few countries \r\nto have achieved most of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Last month, Argentina was recognized by the \r\nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations for its success in combating hunger, and by \r\n8/11 15-29259\r\nA/70/PV.12 27/09/2015\r\nUNESCO in April as one of the countries with the highest \r\nrates of primary school enrolment and investment in \r\neducation. Among other achievements, I should point \r\nout that, over the past decade, Argentina managed to \r\nsubstantially reduce poverty, which now stands at 5 per \r\ncent below the hunger threshold. The infant mortality \r\nrate was reduced by 27 per cent between 1990 and 2013. \r\nThe maternal mortality rate was reduced by 38.5 per \r\ncent, as the result of multiple initiatives carried out \r\nby the national Government. Argentina now has one \r\nof the most comprehensive immunization schedules \r\nin the region and the world. At the end of this year, \r\nwe will provide 19 free and mandatory vaccines. As \r\na national policy in response to the HIV epidemic, we \r\nalso provide universal access to preventive diagnostics \r\nand treatment. \r\nThose achievements demonstrate Argentina’s firm \r\ncommitment to meeting the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, a commitment that we assume today with regard \r\nto the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). The new Agenda embodies the ideals \r\nof our time to bring about a more just, inclusive, equal \r\nand peaceful world. To achieve that aim, the Agenda \r\nmust be designed and implemented with a human \r\nrights-based approach through a specific and consistent \r\naction plan with reliable and transparent monitoring \r\nmechanisms. \r\nArgentina actively participated in the negotiation \r\nof the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and \r\nthe 169 associated targets, which largely reflect the \r\nsocial development policies that we have implemented \r\nover the past decade. \r\nThe Argentine Government underscores the \r\nimportance of this Agenda and will establish the \r\nappropriate national policies to fully implement it by \r\n2030. We hope that, in the next 15 years, the Agenda \r\nis able to mobilize a common effort without ignoring \r\nhistorical responsibilities, which are the result of \r\ncenturies of colonialism and which are reflected in the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities. \r\nWe also hope it is able to achieve what we committed \r\nto at the World Summit on Sustainable Development \r\nand reaffirmed at the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development, the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development and in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nThis agenda includes the protection of the human \r\nrights of women in its affirmation that the achievement \r\nof full human potential and of sustainable development \r\nis not possible if one half of humankind continues to \r\nbe denied its full human rights and opportunities. It \r\nis therefore exceedingly positive that there is a cross-\r\ncutting approach to gender through the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, including Goal 5, specifically on \r\ngender. The implementation of public policies aimed \r\nat women will contribute even more towards ensuring \r\nthat they are socially, economically and politically \r\ninvolved. The Government of Argentina recognizes and \r\nis confronting the challenges ahead of us, and believes \r\nin the necessity of a comprehensive approach to \r\naddressing problems stemming from gender inequality \r\nin order to achieve a more just society by 2030.\r\nArgentina is working towards a model for a \r\ndemocratic and inclusive society, with full respect \r\nfor human rights for everyone. The the right to \r\ndevelopment is so interlinked that we cannot achieve \r\nsustainable development unless we fully respect all \r\nhuman rights and include the most vulnerable members \r\nof the population with dignity. That effort — which \r\nmeans that we must reaffirm that all human rights are \r\nuniversal, indivisible and interdependent — allowed \r\nArgentina to achieve notable and decisive progress in \r\nreducing poverty and unemployment rates, in such a \r\nway that economic growth was accompanied by a real \r\nprocess of social inclusion. Such examples include \r\nour policies on expanding rights, as reflected in \r\nmeaningful progress in the context of gender identity, \r\nensuring death with dignity, equal marriage rights and \r\nmental health rights. The same spirit of inclusivity \r\nis also present in the implementation of our national \r\nanti-discrimination programme, assistance to children \r\nand pregnant women, universal health-care coverage in \r\nour provisional system and the inclusion of migrants in \r\nour national development while ensuring their human \r\nrights without regard to their migratory status. Those \r\nare some of the measures that have been incorporated \r\nin national policy since 2003. That expansion of rights \r\nis today anchored in a solid foundation that provides \r\na crucial role for State policy as a key tool to provide \r\naccess to more equitable living conditions for all \r\nsegments of the population. \r\nArgentina reaffirms the importance of integrating \r\nthe three pillars of sustainable development: inclusive \r\neconomic development, social development and \r\nenvironmental and balanced sustainability. With regard \r\nto the environment, we need to work in a comprehensive \r\nmanner, as stated throughout the Agenda, in order to \r\nprotect, restore and sustainably use our ecosystems, \r\nwhich are central in our development. The Agenda \r\n15-29259 9/11\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.12\r\nenvisions an eventual human right to water. Argentina \r\nsupports the commitment to improve access to drinking \r\nwater and sanitation to all persons, in a fair manner \r\nand without discrimination, as a human right that all \r\nStates should ensure to all people under their respective \r\njurisdictions.\r\nArgentina is concerned about the process of \r\nimplementing the Agenda because — based on what \r\nwe agreed upon at the United Nations Conference \r\non Sustainable Development — that is an indivisible \r\npackage in terms of measures of implementation. \r\nHowever, when it comes to the means of implementation \r\nand financial resources, we see an imbalance between \r\nthe Agenda’s commitments in terms of those taken on by \r\ndeveloping countries and those taken on by developed \r\ncountries. Developed countries are all the more \r\nresponsible to contribute more financially to meet their \r\ncommitments. It is therefore important that we recall \r\nthe historic commitment undertaken — and recalled on \r\nvarious occasions — that developed countries devote \r\n0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to official \r\ndevelopment assistance — a commitment that, with \r\nonly a few exceptions, has not been honoured. That \r\nhas served to delay and even make impossible the \r\nimplementation of many initiatives that could have \r\ncontributed to achieving sustainable development and \r\neradicating poverty throughout the world.\r\nIn contrast, over the last few years, Argentina, along \r\nwith other countries of the South, has been increasing \r\nits South-South cooperation as a response of solidarity \r\nby the countries and the peoples of the South. That has \r\ncome about as a result of our shared characteristics and \r\nexperiences, guided by the principles that underpin \r\nour cooperation. Argentina’s efforts at cooperation \r\nhave been bound up with the United Nations from its \r\ninception, as illustrated by the Buenos Aires Plan of \r\nAction on technical cooperation among developing \r\ncountries and the decision to set up an Argentine fund \r\nfor South-South and triangular cooperation. These are \r\nArgentina’s tools to carry out on the ground agreements \r\nconcluded at the international level. The 2030 \r\nAgenda must be the fulcrum for public investment in \r\ndeveloping countries so as to help transform the system \r\nfor the accumulation of capital, without any decrease, \r\nand generate investment for capacity-building and \r\nopportunities and promote investment in sectors that \r\nadd value.\r\nArgentina hopes that the agreements reached \r\non guiding principles and defined goals will build a \r\ngenuine change for women and children throughout the \r\nworld, insofar as we are able to come up with the means \r\nof implementation, cooperation and monitoring that \r\ncan deliver on the commitments that we have made.\r\nLastly, I would like to conclude by quoting from the \r\nspeech made by His Holiness Pope Francis here in this \r\nHall just two days ago: \r\n“The international financial institutions should work \r\nto help countries achieve sustainable development \r\nand ensure that they are not subjected to oppressive \r\nlending systems that, far from promoting progress, \r\nsubject people to mechanisms that result in greater \r\npoverty, exclusion and dependence”. (A/70/PV.3, \r\np. 3)\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Duda (spoke in Polish; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): I am speaking here in \r\nNew York today as a representative of a nation that just \r\n30 years ago lagged far behind the developed world \r\nwith regard to economic and social indices. The sad \r\nreality experienced today by thousands of countries \r\nthroughout the world was, in the not-so-distant past, \r\nalso my own experience and that of my compatriots.\r\nWe finally threw off the yoke of communism \r\n26 years ago. After 45 years without sovereignty and \r\nhaving been cut off by the Iron Curtain, our country \r\nfound itself in a position of such isolation. Today we are \r\nrebuilding our national freedom, rooted in our national \r\ntraditions. The democracy and entrepreneurship of \r\nPoles are the foundation of our development today. At \r\nthe same time, we must do our best to ensure that our \r\nsocial cohesion, family bonds and traditional system of \r\nvalues are kept in place. \r\nThe credit for the model of Polish development goes \r\nto Solidarity, a unique social movement of which we are \r\nso proud today. The credit goes to millions of Poles, \r\nwho craved freedom and were ready to fight for it. At \r\nlast, they managed to achieve it. But the credit also goes \r\nto the other kind of solidarity — the one we received \r\nfrom more aff luent countries. We benefited from their \r\nfinancial support, their advice and experiences. We \r\nknow how much time and effort it cost us to travel \r\ndown that road. There is still much left to be done. \r\nHowever, as the President of the Republic of Poland, I \r\n10/11 15-29259\r\nA/70/PV.12 27/09/2015\r\nremain convinced that the energy of my fellow citizens, \r\ntheir diligence and their sense of innovation will let us \r\njointly attain the level of development to which we have \r\naspired for a number of years.\r\nWhen I look at the history of contemporary Poland, \r\nI am reminded of a concise slogan coined by a well-\r\nknown American politician, a slogan filled with vigour \r\nand hope: “Yes, we can!” Yes, we are doing it. And the \r\nquestion arises: can others do it too? I have no doubt \r\nthat they can also achieve the same success and one \r\nday say, \r\n“We have also made it. We can be better off, have a \r\nbetter education, and our children will be able to feel \r\nsafe. We will not have to leave our countries — as \r\nwe have to do today — struggling against war and \r\npoverty, looking for safety, security and better \r\nlives, far away from our homeland.”\r\nLet us do everything that we can to ensure that those \r\npeople can return to their homes and peace is restored \r\nand to help those countries come back to the path of \r\neconomic development.\r\nFifteen years have passed since the Millennium \r\nSummit, at which the States Members of the United \r\nNations adopted an ambitious plan for improving the \r\nexistence of the nations of Africa, Asia and Latin \r\nAmerica that suffer most from hunger, epidemics, \r\nilliteracy and high infant mortality. The bar was placed \r\nvery high, and not all of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals have been achieved. Nevertheless, huge steps \r\nforward were taken in many areas. The number of \r\npeople living on $1.25 or less a day fell by more than \r\n50 per cent, from 1.9 billion to 836 million. That can be \r\nconsidered a success. However, we must not forget that \r\nthose 836 million people still live in extreme poverty. \r\nThat is almost as many as the populations of the United \r\nStates and the European Union combined. The number \r\nof new HIV cases has decreased by 40 per cent, and \r\nthat can also be considered a success. But the epidemic \r\nis still not under control. Drinking water has been \r\nmade accessible to almost 2.6 million people, another \r\ngenuine achievement, but more than 660 million are \r\nstill without it.\r\nThe areas covered by the eight Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals resemble a set of connecting tubes. \r\nA lack of clean water leads to dangerous epidemics. \r\nDiseases weaken the human organism. Children \r\nweakened by illnesses miss out on an education, and \r\na lack of education, in turn, means that in future the \r\ncountry and its resources, both natural and human, will \r\nbe mismanaged. Therefore, when we discuss which of \r\nthe 17 Sustainable Development Goals we would like \r\nto achieve by 2030, we cannot be satisfied only with \r\nsuccesses in individual categories. We should do our \r\nbest to ensure equal progress in each of the priority \r\nareas.\r\nMeeting the Sustainable Development Goals will \r\ndemand enormous levels of financing. With that in \r\nmind, we should take even more care to ensure that the \r\nfunds allocated are spent in a thoughtful way that brings \r\nabout concrete results. Donors cannot pat themselves on \r\nthe back for funding this or that project, because this is \r\nnot just about spending money; it is about making smart \r\ninvestments. We should also avoid tying development \r\naid to actions that others see as imposing a system of \r\nvalues or an ideology on them. That applies particularly \r\nto such issues as family models, education, bringing \r\nup children and safeguarding life. We should focus on \r\nstandards that can help ensure freedom and a better life \r\nto everyone equally, such as those related to the rule of \r\nlaw, freedom and inclusive societies. Wherever there \r\nis respect for the law, justice is guaranteed, and public \r\ninstitutions are efficient and work for the benefit of the \r\npeople, that is where we lay the true foundations for \r\ngenuine development and welfare.\r\nSustainable development should also aim at \r\nestablishing good governance, an important element in \r\nenabling humankind and the State to develop. Action for \r\ndevelopment should focus on promoting effectiveness, \r\nand that can be achieved with small, concrete projects. \r\nI would like to point out that we can often do a lot with \r\nlittle money. To cite just one example, a joint report \r\nof the World Health Organization and UNICEF states \r\nthat over the past 15 years the number of new cases of \r\nmalaria has been reduced by 37 per cent. The mortality \r\nindex for that disease has dropped by as much as 60 per \r\ncent, which means that 6 million lives have been saved. \r\nWhile malaria is still killing people, the fight against \r\nit is becoming ever more effective. Why? Among other \r\nthings, thanks to the large-scale use of a thing as simple \r\nas a cheap mosquito net, costing about $10 to produce \r\nand distribute.\r\nThere are more such examples. Pope Francis spoke \r\nrecently about our unacceptable waste of food. How \r\nmuch could be achieved if we only heeded his call? \r\nHow much could we mitigate the effects of climate \r\nchange if we not only limited carbon dioxide emissions \r\nbut also pursued a reasonable forestation policy? \r\n15-29259 11/11\r\n27/09/2015 A/70/PV.12\r\nNumerous regions all over the world are aff licted by \r\nthe problem of desertification. Hundreds of hectares \r\nof forests are disappearing from the Earth and our \r\narable land area is shrinking. Yet afforestation and soil \r\nrehabilitation improve air and water quality. They mean \r\nfewer illnesses and less poverty. We should therefore \r\naddress environmental issues in a comprehensive way, \r\nprotecting our water, land and air.\r\nLet us help the countries that are in need today. But \r\nlet us do it in a smart way, helping them stand on their \r\nown two feet, so that one day they will be able to join \r\nthe global economic system on an equal footing, without \r\nunnecessary limitations and barriers, able to take full \r\nadvantage of the benefits of free trade, to produce \r\nand sell and use that income for further development, \r\nconstructing hospitals, schools, roads and water supply \r\nsystems.\r\nTwo years ago Poland became a member of the \r\nDevelopment Assistance Committee of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, affirming \r\nour position as a country that does not shirk its \r\nresponsibility to help less aff luent or less developed \r\ncountries. In my capacity as President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, I declare that we are fully open and ready \r\nto cooperate with our partners in order to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals by 2030, based on \r\nour capabilities and our ability to tap into Poland’s \r\nexperience in building a free-market democracy. We \r\nwant to ensure that the countries to which we offer our \r\nsupport today can soon say, “We too have succeeded. \r\nWe have done it.”\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland for his statement.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni: We are approaching the end \r\nof this very important Summit. I would like to say that \r\nit is a miracle that we have been able to agree after \r\nsuch a long time. The Bible says that there are two \r\ngreat laws — the first is that we should love God with \r\nall our hearts, and the second is that we should love \r\nour neighbours as we love ourselves. It has been very \r\ndifficult, however, for the people of the world to love \r\none another as they love themselves.\r\nI am therefore amazed that at long last we have got \r\nan agreement that is sensible and global. We are not just \r\ntalking about human rights, because people often talk \r\nabout human rights, but they do it without talking about \r\nproduction. They talk about consumption without talking \r\nabout production. These Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, however, talk about industrialization, trade \r\nand infrastructure development. They do not talk \r\nabout philanthropy; they talk about development and \r\ngrowth and investment. After 50 years of watching the \r\nselfishness there is in the world, I am therefore happy \r\nthat I am now beginning to see some common sense in \r\nthese international forums.\r\nWe have come to the end of this historic Summit. \r\nBefore concluding this plenary meeting, I would like \r\nto invite participants to remain in their seats in order \r\nto view a short video on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. The video, entitled “The Story You Are Shaping”, \r\nwill be shown immediately following the adjournment \r\nof this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.30 p.m.\r\n"
