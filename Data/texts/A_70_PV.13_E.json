Our aim \r\nis clear. Our mission is possible. And our destination is \r\nin our sights — an end to extreme poverty by 2030, a \r\nlife of peace and dignity for all.\r\nWhat counts now is translating the promises \r\non paper into change on the ground. We owe this \r\nand much more to the vulnerable, the oppressed, \r\nthe displaced and the forgotten people in our world. \r\nWe owe this to a world where inequality is growing, \r\ntrust is fading and impatience with leadership can \r\nbe seen and felt far and wide. We owe this to, in the \r\nmemorable words of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\n“succeeding generations”. In this year in which we \r\nmark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations, \r\nwe must heed the call of the Charter and hear the voices \r\nof “We the peoples”. That is how we can overcome the \r\ngrim realities of the present and seize the remarkable \r\nopportunities of our era.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals enabled \r\nhundreds of millions of people to leave poverty behind. \r\nNow we are poised to continue the job while reaching \r\nhigher, broader and deeper. The new framework does \r\nnot just add goals. It weaves the Goals together, with \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and women’s empowerment \r\nas crucial parts of an integrated whole. The global \r\nGoals are universal. Here in the Assembly, the world’s \r\nleaders have committed to leave no one behind and to \r\nfirst reach those farthest behind. The momentum can \r\nhelp us conclude a robust agreement on climate change \r\nin December in Paris. Remarkable changes are under \r\nway to reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. I \r\nhave seen vast solar-power installations bringing a new \r\nenergy future into being. There is wind in the sails of \r\nclimate action.\r\nYet it is clear that the national goals submitted by \r\nthe Member States will not be enough. We face a choice: \r\neither raise our ambitions or risk raising temperatures \r\nabove the 2°C threshold, which science tells us we must \r\nnot cross. Reaching the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nmeans organizing ourselves better. Let there be no more \r\nwalls or boxes; no more ministries or agencies working \r\nat cross-purposes. Let us move from silos to synergy, \r\nsupported by data, long-term planning and a will to do \r\nthings differently.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.13\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n13th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 28 September 2015, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFinancing will be a key test. I welcome the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda and the renewed pledge by \r\ndeveloped countries to invest 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income in official development assistance. Aid \r\nworks, but few countries have met that target. I salute \r\nthose that have and urge others to follow their example. \r\nClimate finance will be crucial. I urge developed \r\ncountries to meet the agreed goal of $100 billion per \r\nyear by 2020. We must also get the Green Climate \r\nFund up and running. The world continues to squander \r\ntrillions in wasteful military spending. Why is it easier \r\nto find the money to destroy people and the planet than \r\nit is to protect them? Succeeding generations depend on \r\nus to finally get our priorities right.\r\nSuffering today is at heights not seen in a generation; \r\n100 million people require immediate humanitarian \r\nassistance. At least 60 million people have been forced \r\nto f lee their homes or their countries. The United \r\nNations has asked for nearly $20 billion to meet this \r\nyear’s needs — six times the level of a decade ago. \r\nUnited Nations humanitarian agencies and our partners \r\nare braving difficult conditions to reach people. Member \r\nStates have been generous, but demands continue to \r\ndwarf funding. The World Humanitarian Summit, to be \r\nheld in May 2016 in Istanbul, will be a critical moment \r\nto reaffirm solidarity and explore how to better build \r\nresilience and address emergencies.\r\nBut the global humanitarian system is not broken; \r\nit is broke. We are not receiving enough money to save \r\nenough lives. We have about half of what we need to \r\nhelp the people of Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen, and \r\njust a third for Syria. Our response plan for Ukraine \r\nis just 39 per cent funded. And the appeal for Gambia, \r\nwhere one in four children suffers from stunting, has \r\nbeen met with silence. Numbers this low raise suffering \r\nto new highs. People need emergency assistance, but \r\nwhat they want even more is lasting solutions. They \r\nmay appreciate a tent, but they deserve to go home.\r\nOur aim is not just to keep people alive, but to give \r\nthem a life, a decent life. Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey \r\nare generously hosting several million Syrian and \r\nIraqi refugees. Countries across the developing world \r\ncontinue to host and receive large numbers of refugees \r\ndespite their own limited means. People are on the move \r\nas never before — in the Americas and the Sahel, in \r\nthe Mediterranean and the Andaman Sea. These f lows \r\nraise complex issues and rouse strong passions. Certain \r\ntouchstones must guide our response: international law, \r\nhuman rights, basic compassion.\r\nAll countries need to do more to shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities. I commend those in Europe that are \r\nupholding the European Union’s values and providing \r\nasylum. At the same time, I urge Europe to do more. \r\nAfter the Second World War, it was Europeans seeking \r\nthe world’s assistance.\r\nOn 30 September, I will convene a high-level \r\nmeeting, aimed at promoting a comprehensive approach \r\nto the refugee and migration crisis. We must crack \r\ndown on traffickers and address the pressures being \r\nfaced by countries of destination. We must combat \r\ndiscrimination. In the twenty-first century, we should \r\nnot be building fences or walls. But above all, we must \r\nlook at root causes in countries of origin.\r\nSyrians are leaving their country and their homes \r\nbecause of oppression, extremism, destruction and \r\nfear. Four years of diplomatic paralysis by the Security \r\nCouncil and others have allowed the crisis to spin out \r\nof control. The responsibility for ending the conflict \r\nlies first and foremost with the Syrian warring parties. \r\nThey are the ones turning their country into ruins. But \r\nit is not enough to look only within Syria for a solution, \r\nThe battle is also being driven by regional powers and \r\nrivalries. Weapons and money f lowing into the country \r\nare fuelling the fire.\r\nMy Special Envoy is doing everything he can to \r\nforge the basis for a peaceful settlement. It is time \r\nnow for others, primarily the Security Council and \r\nkey regional actors, to step forward. Five countries \r\nin particular hold the key: the Russian Federation, the \r\nUnited States, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey. But as \r\nlong as one side will not compromise with the other, \r\nit is futile to expect change on the ground. Innocent \r\nSyrians pay the price of more barrel bombs and \r\nterrorism. There must be no impunity for atrocious \r\ncrimes. Our commitment to justice should lead us to \r\nrefer the situation to the International Criminal Court.\r\nIn Yemen, 21 million people — 80 per cent of the \r\npopulation — need humanitarian assistance. All sides \r\nare showing disregard for human life, but most of the \r\ncasualties are being caused by air strikes. I call for an \r\nend to the bombings, which are also destroying Yemeni \r\ncities, infrastructure and heritage. Here, too, the proxy \r\nbattles of others are driving the fighting. I once again \r\nurge the parties to return to the table, negotiate in good \r\nfaith and resolve the crisis through dialogue facilitated \r\n15-29265 3/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nby my Special Envoy. Let me be clear: there is no \r\nmilitary solution to this conflict.\r\nWe must also guard against the dangerous drift \r\nin the Middle East peace process. With settlements \r\nexpanding and incitement and provocations on the rise, \r\nit is essential for Israelis and Palestinians to re-engage \r\nand for the international community to pressure the \r\nparties to do so. The world can no longer wait for \r\nleaders to finally choose a path to peace.\r\nDaesh, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab remain major \r\nthreats, especially to the women and girls who have \r\nbeen systematically targeted. The world must unite \r\nagainst the blatant brutality of these groups. We must \r\nalso counter the exclusion and hopelessness on which \r\nextremists feed. Moreover, States must never violate \r\nhuman rights in the fight against terror; such abuses \r\nonly perpetuate the cycle. Early next year, I will present \r\nto the General Assembly a plan of action on how to \r\ncounter violent extremism and terrorism.\r\nI commend the landmark nuclear agreement \r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the P5+1 \r\ncountries. Dialogue and patient diplomacy have paid \r\ndividends. I hope this spirit of solidarity among the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council can be \r\ndemonstrated in other conflict areas, such as Syria, \r\nYemen and Ukraine. Let us build on the recent \r\nagreements in South Sudan and finalize the agreement \r\nin Libya, and spare those countries further suffering.\r\nNow is the time for renewed dialogue to address \r\ncontinuing tension on the Korean peninsula. I call \r\non the parties to refrain from taking any action that \r\nmay increase mistrust, and I urge them to instead \r\npromote reconciliation and efforts towards a peaceful, \r\ndenuclearized peninsula. I am ready to support \r\ninter-Korean cooperation. We also need to step up our \r\nwork for the well-being of the people of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea.\r\nI am deeply troubled by growing restrictions on \r\nmedia freedoms and civil society across the world. It is \r\nnot a crime for journalists, human rights defenders and \r\nothers to exercise their basic rights. We must preserve \r\nthe space for civil society and the press to do their vital \r\nwork, without fear of attack and imprisonment.\r\nDemocratic backsliding is a threat in too many \r\nplaces, as leaders seek to stay in office beyond their \r\nmandated limits. We see rallies and petitions being \r\nengineered to look like the spontaneous will of the \r\npeople. Those manufactured groundswells of support \r\nonly lay the groundwork for instability. I urge leaders \r\nto abide by the constitutional limits on their terms.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCollectively, these crises have stretched to the \r\nlimits the vital tools available to us for conflict \r\nresolution and for humanitarian response. Earlier this \r\nmonth, I put forward my vision for strengthening \r\nUnited Nations peace operations (A/70/357), building \r\non the recommendations of an independent panel. Our \r\npeacekeeping operations and political missions need \r\nenhanced capabilities and clear political objectives. We \r\nneed a renewed commitment to prevention, stronger \r\nregional partnerships and sustained engagement on \r\npeacebuilding. And we must unlock the potential of \r\nwomen to advance peace, as envisaged in Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000). I hope the General \r\nAssembly will act promptly, as a signal of its strong \r\ncommitment to this effort. People today, and \r\nsucceeding generations, need us to make the most of \r\nthis opportunity for comprehensive progress.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFounded in a fractured world, the United Nations \r\nbrought hope that collective action could avoid another \r\nglobal catastrophe. Over the past 70 years, we have \r\nhelped to liberate millions of people from colonialism \r\nand supported the successful struggle against apartheid. \r\nWe have defeated deadly diseases, defended human \r\nrights and deepened the rule of law.\r\nThis and more we have done, but that is far \r\nfrom enough. We are living through a time of severe \r\ntesting, but also one of great opportunity. Today, we \r\nare more connected than ever, better informed than \r\never and have better tools than ever. The recipes for \r\npositive change are on the table; the ingredients for \r\nsuccess are in our hands. We continue to reform the \r\nUnited Nations, although we know we must do much \r\nmore, both managerially and politically. We can draw \r\nstrength from the empowerment of women, but we still \r\nneed to step it up for gender equality on the way to \r\nPlanet 50-50.\r\nI am inspired by the world’s young people, who \r\nmake up half the world’s population and whose voices \r\nwe must integrate more fully in decision-making \r\neverywhere. I am impressed with the way all of us can \r\nunite behind vital causes, like the 2030 Agenda.\r\nOne year ago, when we gathered for the general \r\ndebate, the Ebola crisis in West Africa was claiming \r\n4/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nlives daily. Families were being devastated. Fear \r\nwas rife. Forecasts suggested frightening losses in \r\nthe months ahead. Today, thanks to collective action \r\nby communities and their Governments and others \r\nall around the world, cases of Ebola have declined \r\ndramatically. The outbreak is not over, and we must \r\nremain vigilant. But the response is working, with \r\nlessons pointing to a safer future for all.\r\nWhen we stand together, there is no limit to what \r\nwe can achieve. Three days ago, young people from \r\nmany nations stood together in the balcony of this Hall. \r\nThey asked for one thing above all: change. There is \r\nnothing we can say to the world’s children that can \r\nconvince them the world needs to be the way it is. That \r\nmeans we must do everything we can to close the gap \r\nbetween the world as it is and the world as it should be. \r\nThat is the mission of the United Nations.\r\nLet us work together to make this world better for \r\nall, where everybody can live with human dignity and \r\nprosperity. I thank those present for their leadership.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.\r\nAgenda item 8\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I shall now deliver a statement in \r\nmy capacity as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session.\r\nOn Friday, the Heads of States and Governments \r\napproved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), a genuinely transformative decision \r\nepic in its analysis and revolutionary in its ambition, a \r\ndecision that once again proved the universal relevance \r\nand value of the United Nations. Now, we face the even \r\nmore daunting task of transforming our vision into \r\naction.\r\nOur ambition will be realized only in a world of \r\npeace and security and respect for human rights, not \r\nin a world where investment in armament and wars \r\nincreasingly absorbs and destroys a huge share of the \r\nresources we have committed to invest in sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It will not be realized in a world where \r\nwar, poverty, hunger, deep inequalities and poor \r\ngovernance are drivers of ever-growing waves of \r\nrefugees and uncontrolled human migration, and where \r\nall these elements count heavily among the causes of \r\nconflicts, which in turn affect and uproot many more \r\npeople.\r\nGovernments will also succeed in implementing \r\nthis great agenda only with the continued and expanding \r\nparticipation of all stakeholders — parliamentarians, \r\nleaders of regions, cities and local communities, civil \r\nsociety, youth, religious communities and trade unions, \r\nbusiness and academia worldwide. And the great goals \r\nof the United Nations will be fulfilled only when we \r\nrealize that global interdependency is more pronounced \r\nthan ever before. So, too, is the urgency for joint global \r\naction.\r\nWith the Millennium Development Goals, we have \r\nover the past 15 years cut the number of extremely poor \r\npeople by half. With the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), however, we acknowledge that eradicating \r\npoverty in all its forms is possible only with a much \r\nmore complex transformation of the entire global \r\neconomy, the environment and social structures.\r\nWe realize that we cannot rely only on the traditional \r\ngrowth model of the past 15 — or the past 70 — years. \r\nIncredible and unsustainable inequality in income, \r\nwealth and access to resources and to quality \r\neducation and health services must be overcome. We \r\nunderline more vigorously than ever that equal rights \r\nand opportunities for girls and women are crucial \r\npreconditions for a sustainable future everywhere. We \r\nrecognize that each and every person has a legitimate \r\ndemand for a decent life. But as the number of people \r\non our planet has tripled since I was born nearly \r\n70 years ago, we must meet this demand without \r\nfurther depleting the natural resources that we pass on \r\nto new generations. We acknowledge also that people \r\nin developed countries cannot continue to consume and \r\nproduce in the manner they are used to and that billions \r\nof hardworking people elsewhere on their road to \r\nprosperity should not simply adopt the same behaviour \r\nas that of today’s rich countries.\r\nTo build a sustainable global infrastructure over the \r\nnext 15 years, trillions of dollars need to be to invested. \r\nThe least developed countries can do this only when rich \r\ncountries live up to their long-standing commitments \r\nof a minimum of 0.7 per cent of their national income \r\nin development assistance. National Governments \r\ncan fund their share of the investment required only \r\nby fighting corruption and building efficient State tax \r\nsystems. A much stronger international cooperation \r\nmust ensure that rich companies and rich individuals \r\n15-29265 5/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\npay taxes where they earn their money and are no \r\nlonger able to evade payment in tax havens.\r\nFinally, we must realize that a huge share of the \r\ninvestment in a better future must come from private \r\nsources, such as companies, capital investors and \r\npension funds. Therefore, it is crucial that Governments \r\ncreate a framework for markets that makes green \r\ninvestment the obvious, safer and better investment, \r\nnot only for humankind and the longer perspective, but \r\nfor business now.\r\nIt is due time for far-reaching decisions to bring an \r\nend to devastating conflicts and to start investing big in \r\nsustainable development. Action is needed now. If we \r\nfail, we run the overwhelming risk of unmanageable and \r\ninescapable damage to the political, social, ecological \r\nand climate balance of our planet. If we fail, the SDGs \r\nwill never be reached, because the resources needed \r\nwill be swallowed up in addressing crises and conflicts.\r\nIf we fail to stop climate change, the consequences \r\nwill be catastrophic. Further hundreds of millions \r\nof people will be forced away from their habitats. \r\nHistorically, migration has brought huge benefits to \r\nthe global community. But large-scale, uncontrolled \r\nmigrations have the potential to destabilize societies, \r\nleading to conflicts far more damaging than those we \r\nare not able to deal with in an orderly and humanitarian \r\nfashion today.\r\nWe live in paradoxical and transformational times. \r\nNever before has such a large share of humankind \r\nenjoyed so good a life, yet never before have we been \r\nat greater risk of fundamentally disrupting the basic \r\nliving conditions on our small globe. And while a \r\nlarger part of humankind lives in peace and has done \r\nso for longer periods than earlier in human history, \r\nthe follies of war and self-destruction have increased \r\nin the Middle East, in parts of Africa and once again \r\nin Europe, creating unfathomable humanitarian \r\ncatastrophes and more refugees than at any time since \r\nthe end of the Second World War. Tensions between \r\nmajor powers are increasing, as are investments in all \r\nkinds of armaments. Vast arsenals of nuclear, chemical \r\nand biological weapons still exist, and disarmament \r\nnegotiations in Geneva have been stalled for years.\r\nFour weeks ago, I visited Hiroshima and was once \r\nagain confronted with the horrors of nuclear war. We \r\nmust remember that at this very moment all too many \r\nnuclear warheads are still on high alert, and we have \r\nnot eliminated the risks of nuclear conflicts by mistake. \r\nFirst of all, therefore, we need to rebuild confidence \r\nand scale back these risks.\r\nWe must — here in the United Nations, here in \r\nthis very Hall — make an extraordinary effort to break \r\nall the vicious cycles. We must act in accordance with \r\nthe agreed understanding behind the 2030 Agenda by \r\nrecognizing the strong linkages between development, \r\npeace and security, and respect for human rights, and \r\nwe must take specific actions to make progress in \r\neach of these areas. This will be the central focus of \r\nthe seventieth session of the General Assembly and my \r\npresidency. I will offer my strong support to new ideas \r\non how to strengthen global peace and security, from \r\nthe role of women to conflict prevention, mediation \r\nand settlement; from United Nations peace operations \r\nto the overall peacebuilding architecture and Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nIt is my sincere hope that the United Nations \r\nwill develop a more direct role in reconciliation and \r\npeacebuilding, including in conflicts where we have \r\nfailed until now, and that we will move forward in our \r\ncommon efforts to prevent vicious radicalization and \r\nfight the evil of terrorism.\r\nWith parties living up to their promises, the \r\nnuclear agreement between Iran and the five permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council, Germany and the \r\nEuropean Union can be a very important contribution \r\nto avoiding nuclear proliferation.\r\nImpatiently we await the day when major and \r\nregional Powers also join forces to stop the senseless \r\nand horrifying bloodshed in and around Syria and, in \r\ndoing so, address the root causes of the refugee crisis. \r\nI am sure we all wish that this day would come very \r\nsoon and want to contribute the most we can to such an \r\noutcome.\r\nI am sure that Member States, building on our great \r\n2030 Agenda, will increase their efforts to make human \r\nrights a reality for all people without discrimination, \r\nfrom fundamental rights, such as safe access to food, \r\nclean water, quality health and education services \r\nand decent work, to civil and political rights, such as \r\nfreedom of expression and association; from the rights \r\nof migrants and indigenous peoples to those of women, \r\nchildren and persons with disabilities. We must also \r\nadvance efforts to strengthen good governance and the \r\nrule of law.\r\nAs President of the General Assembly, I will support \r\nMember States in their ambitions for revitalization and \r\n6/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nreform, including a new, more transparent process for \r\nthe selection of the next Secretary-General.\r\nThis seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nmust be a defining year to confirm and invigorate the \r\nuniversal values that we the peoples agreed upon in \r\nthe Charter. No one shall be left behind, because, as \r\nthe Norwegian author Nordahl Grieg wrote: “Noble is \r\nmankind, the earth is rich. If there is need and hunger, \r\nit is by deceit.”\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers for the general debate has been established \r\non the agreed basis that statements should be no longer \r\nthan 15 minutes to enable all the speakers to be heard \r\nat a given meeting. Within this time frame, I would like \r\nto appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nreasonable pace so that interpretation in the six official \r\nUnited Nations languages may be provided properly.\r\nI would like also to draw attention to the decision \r\ntaken by the General Assembly at previous sessions, \r\nnamely that the practice of expressing congratulations \r\ninside the General Assembly Hall after a speech has been \r\ndelivered is strongly discouraged. In that connection, \r\nafter delivering their statements, speakers are invited to \r\nexit the Hall through room GA-200, located behind the \r\nrostrum, before returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees \r\nto proceed in the manner outlined during the general \r\ndebate of the seventieth session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Finally, I should like to draw the \r\nattention of members to the fact that, during the general \r\ndebate, official photos of all the speakers are taken \r\nby the Department of Public Information. Members \r\ninterested in obtaining those photos are requested to \r\ncontact the Photo Library of the United Nations.\r\nAddress by Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Federative Republic of \r\nBrazil.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHer Excellency Ms. Dilma Rousseff, President of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rousseff (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is a \r\nprivilege to address the General Assembly this year as \r\nthe United Nations celebrates its seventieth birthday.\r\nMy first remarks are to congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on having been chosen to preside over \r\nthe Assembly. I reiterate, in particular, Brazil’s support \r\nfor your willingness to put in place measures that will \r\nultimately strengthen the Organization’s development \r\nagenda.\r\nSeventy years have passed since the San Francisco \r\nConference. On that occasion, the international \r\ncommunity sought to build a world founded on \r\ninternational law and on the pursuit of the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts. Since then, we have seen progress \r\nand setbacks. The decolonization process has evolved \r\nremarkably, as can be seen from the composition of the \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe United Nations has since expanded its \r\ninitiatives and incorporated into the development \r\nagenda the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). In other words, it is addressing issues \r\nrelated to the environment, poverty eradication, social \r\nand economic development and access to quality \r\nservices, while issues related to urban life, gender, \r\nwomen and children, and race have all gained priority \r\non the agenda.\r\nHowever, the Organization has not achieved the same \r\nsuccess in addressing collective security challenges, \r\neven though they were at the origin of the Organization \r\nand at the centre of its concerns. The proliferation of \r\nregional conflicts, some of which have the potential \r\nto be highly destructive, and the spread of terrorism, \r\nwhich kills men, women and children, destroys our \r\ncommon heritage and displaces millions of people \r\nfrom their long-established communities, demonstrate \r\nall too well that the United Nations is currently being \r\nseverely tested. One cannot be complacent in the face \r\nof barbaric acts such as those perpetrated by the so- \r\ncalled Islamic State and other associated groups. The \r\nsituation today explains, to a large extent, the refugee \r\ncrisis currently facing humankind.\r\n15-29265 7/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nA substantial proportion of the men, women and \r\nchildren who desperately brave the waters of the \r\nMediterranean and wearily make their way along \r\nthe roads of Europe come from the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa, from countries whose State institutions \r\nhave been dismantled by military actions undertaken \r\nin contravention of international law, thereby opening \r\nspace for the proliferation of terrorism. The deep \r\nsense of indignation caused by the picture of a dead \r\nSyrian boy on the beaches of Turkey and by the news \r\nof the 71 persons asphyxiated inside a truck in Austria \r\nshould be translated into unmistakable acts of practical \r\nsolidarity.\r\nIn a world where goods, capital, information \r\nand ideas f low freely, it is absurd to prevent the free \r\nf low of people. Brazil is a host country, a welcoming \r\ncountry, one that is made up of people from around the \r\nworld. We have received Syrians, Haitians, men and \r\nwomen, just as we have provided shelter for more than \r\na century to millions of Europeans, Arabs and Asians. \r\nWe are an open society. We welcome refugees. We are \r\na multi-ethnic country, where differences coexist. We \r\nknow all too well the importance of differences, which \r\nultimately make us stronger, richer and more diverse \r\nculturally, socially and economically.\r\nThe disquieting backdrop I have just described \r\ndemands that we reflect on the future of the United \r\nNations and requires that we act resolutely and quickly. \r\nWe need a United Nations that is capable of promoting \r\nlasting international peace and of acting swiftly \r\nand effectively during crises, regional and localized \r\nconflicts and in response to any crimes against \r\nhumanity. We can no longer delay, for example, the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State that coexists peacefully \r\nand harmoniously with Israel. Similarly, the expansion \r\nof settlements in the occupied territories cannot be \r\ntolerated.\r\nIn order to give the United Nations the central \r\nrole it is rightfully entitled to, a comprehensive reform \r\nof its structures must be carried out. The Security \r\nCouncil must be expanded in its permanent and \r\nnon-permanent member categories in order to become \r\nmore representative, legitimate and effective. Most \r\nMember States do not want a decision on this matter \r\nto be postponed forever. We hope that the current \r\nsession will enter into history as a turning point in the \r\ntrajectory of the United Nations and that it will yield \r\nconcrete results in the long, and so far inconclusive, \r\nreform process of the Organization.\r\nIn our region of the world — where peace and \r\ndemocracy reign — we welcome the re-establishment \r\nof diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America, which puts an end to a dispute \r\nstemming back to the Cold War. We hope that this \r\nprocess will be completed with the end of the embargo \r\ncurrently imposed on Cuba. We also celebrate the \r\nrecent agreement reached with Iran, which will enable \r\nthat country to develop nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes and to restore the hope of peace to an entire \r\nregion. Together, the countries of Brazil, Russia, \r\nIndia, China and South Africa have launched a new \r\ndevelopment bank, which will assist in expanding trade \r\nand investment and will also possibly help to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) outlines the future we want. The 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals reaffirm the basic \r\ntenet of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, that is, it is possible to grow, include, \r\npreserve and protect. They establish universal targets \r\nand stress the need for cooperation among people and a \r\nshared path for humankind. The 2030 Agenda requires \r\nglobal solidarity, determination from each one of us and \r\na commitment to tackling climate change, overcoming \r\nextreme poverty and creating opportunities for all.\r\nIn Paris, next December, we must strengthen the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange by ensuring that its provisions are fulfilled \r\nand its principles respected. The obligations we take \r\non in Paris should be ambitious in scope and nature \r\nand should include financial and technological support \r\nto developing countries and small island States, in \r\nline with the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nBrazil is making a substantial effort to reduce \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing its \r\ndevelopment. We continue to diversify the renewable \r\nsources in our energy mix, which is among the cleanest \r\nin the world. We are also currently investing in low-\r\ncarbon agriculture. We have reduced deforestation \r\nin the Amazonian region by 82 per cent. A sense of \r\nambition will continue to guide our actions. In this \r\nspirit, I announced yesterday at the United Nations \r\nBrazil’s intended nationally determined contribution, \r\nwhich is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by \r\n43 per cent by 2030, with 2005 as the baseline year. \r\nDuring this period, Brazil intends to put an end to \r\nillegal deforestation and to reforest 12 million hectares, \r\n8/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nto recover 15 million hectares of degraded pasture lands \r\nand to integrate 5 million hectares of crop, livestock \r\nand forest.\r\nIn a world where the share of renewable energy \r\naccounts for only 13 per cent on average of the overall \r\nenergy mix worldwide, we intend to derive 45 per cent \r\nof our domestic energy mix from renewable sources. \r\nTo that end, we will pursue a share of 66 per cent for \r\nhydropower in our electricity generation output and a \r\nshare of 23 per cent for renewable energy, including \r\nfrom wind, solar and biomass sources, in electrical \r\nenergy generation. We will also seek an increase \r\nof about 10 per cent in energy efficiency and will \r\nadd a share of 16 per cent of ethanol fuel and other \r\nsugarcane-derived biomass sources to our energy mix. \r\nBrazil is thus contributing decisively to the global \r\nefforts to implement the recommendations of the \r\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has \r\nestablished a limit of no more than 2°C on temperature \r\nincreases for this century.\r\nWe are one of the few developing countries to set \r\nan absolute emissions reduction target. Our intended \r\nnationally determined contributions include actions to \r\nincrease environmental resilience and reduce the risks \r\nassociated with the negative effects of climate change \r\nfor the poorest and most vulnerable populations, with \r\nan emphasis on gender issues, workers’ rights and the \r\nrights of indigenous, former black slave and traditional \r\ncommunities.\r\nWe recognize the importance of South-South \r\ncooperation in the global efforts to counter climate \r\nchange. Allow me to stress that, since 2003, social and \r\nincome transfer policies have helped lift over 36 million \r\npeople out of extreme poverty. Last year, Brazil was \r\nofficially removed from the World Hunger Map. This \r\nis a testament to the effectiveness of our so-called \r\nzero-hunger policy, which has now evolved to become \r\nSustainable Development Goal 2.\r\nIn the transition to a low-carbon economy, it is \r\nimportant to ensure dignified and fair conditions \r\nfor workers. Sustainable development requires us to \r\ncommit to the promotion of decent work, the generation \r\nof quality jobs and guaranteed opportunities for all.\r\nOur efforts to eradicate poverty and promote \r\ndevelopment must be collective and global in scope. In \r\nmy country, however, we know that the end of extreme \r\npoverty is only the beginning of a long journey marked \r\nby new gains. For six years, we have been working to \r\nprevent the impact of the world crisis that began in 2008 \r\nin the developed world from overwhelming our economy \r\nand our society. During those six years, we have adopted \r\na comprehensive set of measures, including reducing \r\ntaxes, expanding credit, strengthening investment and \r\nstimulating household consumption. We have increased \r\nemployment opportunities and income levels in that \r\nperiod. This effort has now come to an end owing to both \r\ndomestic fiscal constraints and external conditions. The \r\nslow recovery of the world economy and the end of the \r\n”commodity super cycle” have negatively affected our \r\neconomic growth. Currency devaluation and recession \r\npressures have triggered inflation and a substantial \r\nreduction in tax revenue, leading to restrictions in \r\npublic finance.\r\nBrazil does not have any serious structural \r\nproblems, however. Our problems are limited to the \r\ncurrent circumstances. In order to address this situation, \r\nwe are rebalancing our budget and have substantially \r\nreduced public expenditures and even investments. \r\nWe have realigned prices. We are adopting measures \r\nto permanently reduce spending. We have proposed \r\ndrastic spending cuts and we are redefining our \r\nsources of revenue. All of these initiatives are aimed at \r\nreorganizing the fiscal framework, reducing inflation, \r\nconsolidating macroeconomic stability, boosting \r\nconfidence in the economy and ensuring the resumption \r\nof economic growth with income distribution.\r\nThe Brazilian economy is today stronger, more \r\nsolid and more resilient than it was a few years ago. We \r\nare in a position to overcome the current difficulties \r\nas we advance on our path towards development. We \r\nfind ourselves at a moment of transition to another \r\ncycle of economic expansion, one that has greater depth \r\nand is more solid and long-lasting. In addition to the \r\nfiscal and financial rebalancing actions and providing \r\nincentives for exports, we have also adopted measures \r\nto encourage investments in infrastructure and energy.\r\nIn Brazil, the process of social inclusion has not \r\nbeen interrupted. We hope that inflation control and the \r\nresumption of economic growth and credit availability \r\nwill help to further expand household consumption. \r\nThis is the basis for a new development cycle, led by \r\nan increase in productivity and the generation of more \r\ninvestment opportunities for businesses and more job \r\nopportunities for citizens.\r\nThe gains we have achieved over the past few \r\nyears have been reached in the environment of our \r\nstrengthened and deepened democracy. Thanks to an \r\n15-29265 9/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\neffective legal framework and vigorous democratic \r\ninstitutions, the functioning of the State is being \r\nfirmly and impartially examined by the judiciary and \r\nthe governmental agencies in charge of investigating, \r\nassessing and punishing any misconduct.\r\nThe Brazilian Government and society do not and \r\nwill not tolerate corruption. Brazil’s democracy grows \r\nstronger when its authorities recognize the limits \r\nimposed by the law as their own limits. We Brazilians \r\ndesire a country where the law represents the limit. Many \r\nof us fought for that, precisely when laws and rights \r\nwere being violated during the military dictatorship. \r\nWe desire a country where governmental authorities \r\nconduct themselves strictly according to their duties, \r\nwithout ever succumbing to excess; where judges try \r\nand judge cases freely and impartially, without any \r\npressure whatsoever, independent of political passion \r\nand without ever compromising on the presumption of \r\nthe innocence of any citizen.\r\nWe desire a country where the clash of ideas takes \r\nplace in a civilized and respectful environment. We \r\nwant a country where the freedom of the press is one \r\nof the cornerstones of the freedom of speech and of the \r\nexpression of different positions, namely, the rights of \r\nall Brazilians. Legal sanctions must be applied against \r\nall those who have committed illicit acts, bearing in \r\nmind the need to uphold the principle of due process. \r\nThose are the very foundations of our democracy. In \r\nthat regard, I wish to avail myself of a recent quote by \r\nmy friend José Mujica, former President of Uruguay. \r\nHe said: “Democracy is not perfect, for we are not \r\nperfect. However, we must defend it in order to improve \r\nit and not deny it”. Allow me to state for the record that \r\nBrazil will continue on the path of democracy and will \r\nnever relinquish the achievements for which we have so \r\ngreatly struggled.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nthat Brazil welcomes citizens from around the world, \r\nwith open arms, for the 2016 Summer Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro. We look \r\nforward to welcoming each and every one. It will be a \r\nunique opportunity to promote sport as a key instrument \r\nfor peace, social inclusion and tolerance in the fight \r\nagainst racial, ethnic and gender discrimination. It \r\nwill also be an opportunity to promote the rights and \r\ninclusion of persons with disabilities, one of the top \r\npriorities of my Government.\r\nOne last point is that a few days ago, here at United \r\nNations Headquarters, the murals entitled War and \r\nPeace by the Brazilian artist Candido Portinari, which \r\nwere donated to this Organization by the Government of \r\nmy country in 1957, were re-inaugurated. Those works \r\nof art denounce violence and poverty and further urge \r\nthe people of the world to seek mutual understanding \r\nand tolerance. They stand as a symbol of the ultimate \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations, namely, to prevent \r\narmed conflict and promote peace, social justice and \r\nthe eradication of hunger and poverty. Portinari often \r\nstated that “there is no great work of art that is not \r\nidentified by the people surrounding it”. The message \r\nof the murals remains timely and topical. It speaks not \r\nonly to the victims of wars, but also to the refugees who \r\nrisk their lives on fragile boats in the Mediterranean and \r\nto all of the anonymous people who turn to the United \r\nNations seeking protection, peace and well-being.\r\nWe hope that, as we walk into the premises of the \r\nUnited Nations and gaze upon those very murals at the \r\nentrance, we may be capable of hearing the voices of \r\nthe people we represent and of working persistently \r\nto ensure that their calls for peace and progress are \r\nmet. After all, those were the very ideals that were \r\npresent 70 years ago at the foundation of the United \r\nNations Organization, this major accomplishment of \r\nhumankind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federative Republic \r\nof Brazil for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Dilma Rousseff, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Barack Obama, President of the \r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Obama: Seventy years after the founding \r\nof the United Nations it is worth reflecting on what the \r\n10/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nmembers of this body, working together, have helped \r\nto achieve. Out of the ashes of the Second World War, \r\nhaving witnessed the unthinkable power of the atomic \r\nage, the United States has worked with many nations in \r\nthe Assembly to prevent a third world war — by forging \r\nalliances with old adversaries; by supporting the steady \r\nemergence of strong democracies accountable to their \r\npeople and not to any foreign Power; and by building \r\nan international system that imposes a cost on those \r\nwho choose conflict over cooperation, an order that \r\nrecognizes the dignity and equal worth of all people.\r\nThat has been the work of seven decades. That is the \r\nideal that this body has, at its best, pursued. Of course, \r\nthere have been too many times when, collectively, \r\nwe have fallen short of those ideals. Over the seven \r\ndecades, terrible conflicts have claimed untold victims. \r\nBut we have pressed forward, slowly, steadily, to make \r\na system of international rules and norms that are better \r\nand stronger and more consistent.\r\nIt is that international order that has underwritten \r\nunparalleled advances in human liberty and prosperity. \r\nIt is that collective endeavour that has brought about \r\ndiplomatic cooperation among the world’s major \r\nPowers and buttressed a global economy that has lifted \r\nmore than a billion people from poverty. It is those \r\ninternational principles that have helped constrain \r\nbigger countries from imposing their will on smaller \r\nones and have advanced the emergence of democracy \r\nand development and individual liberty on every \r\ncontinent.\r\nThat progress is real. It can be documented in lives \r\nsaved, agreements forged, diseases conquered and \r\nmouths fed. And yet we come together today knowing \r\nthat the march of human progress never travels in a \r\nstraight line, that our work is far from complete and that \r\ndangerous currents risk pulling us back into a darker, \r\nmore disordered world.\r\nToday we are seeing the collapse of strongmen and \r\nfragile States breeding conflict and driving innocent \r\nmen, women and children across borders on an epic \r\nscale. Brutal networks of terror have stepped into the \r\nvacuum. Technologies that empower individuals are \r\nnow also exploited by those who spread disinformation, \r\nsuppress dissent or radicalize our youth. Global capital \r\nf lows have powered growth and investment, but they \r\nhave also increased the risk of contagion, weakened the \r\nbargaining power of workers and accelerated inequality.\r\nHow should we respond to those trends? There are \r\nthose who argue that the ideals enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations are unachievable or out of date, \r\na legacy of a postwar era not suited to our own. In \r\neffect, they are arguing for a return to the rules that \r\napplied for most of human history and that predate this \r\ninstitution — the belief that power is a zero-sum game, \r\nthat might makes right, that strong States must impose \r\ntheir will on weaker ones, that the rights of individuals \r\ndo not matter and that in a time of rapid change, order \r\nmust be imposed by force.\r\nOn that basis, we see some major Powers assert \r\nthemselves in ways that contravene international law. \r\nWe see an erosion of the democratic principles and \r\nhuman rights that are fundamental to this institution’s \r\nmission. Information is strictly controlled and the \r\nspace for civil society restricted. We are told that such \r\nretrenchment is required to beat back disorder; that it is \r\nthe only way to stamp out terrorism and prevent foreign \r\nmeddling. In accordance with that logic, we should \r\nsupport tyrants like Bashar Al-Assad, who drops barrel \r\nbombs to massacre innocent children, because the \r\nalternative is surely worse.\r\nThis increasing scepticism of our international order \r\ncan also be found in the most advanced democracies. \r\nWe see greater polarization and more frequent gridlock, \r\nwith movements on the far right, and sometimes the \r\nleft, that insist on stopping the trade that binds our fates \r\nto other nations or calling for the building of walls to \r\nkeep out immigrants. Most ominously, we see the fears \r\nof ordinary people being exploited through appeals \r\nto sectarianism, tribalism, racism or anti-Semitism; \r\nappeals to a glorious past before the body politic was \r\ninfected by those who look different or worship God \r\ndifferently — a politics of us versus them.\r\nThe United States is not immune to this. Even as \r\nour economy is growing and our troops have largely \r\nreturned from Iraq and Afghanistan, we see in our \r\ndebates about America’s role in the world a notion of \r\nstrength that is defined by opposition to old enemies, \r\nperceived adversaries — a rising China or resurgent \r\nRussia, a revolutionary Iran or an Islam that is \r\nincompatible with peace. We see arguments that the \r\nonly strength that matters for the United States is \r\nbellicose words and shows of military force, and that \r\ncooperation and diplomacy will not work.\r\nAs President of the United States, I am mindful \r\nof the dangers that we face. They cross my desk every \r\n15-29265 11/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nmorning. I lead the strongest military that the world \r\nhas ever known, and I will never hesitate to protect my \r\ncountry or our allies, unilaterally and by force where \r\nnecessary. But I stand before the Assembly today \r\nbelieving in my core that we, the nations of the world, \r\ncannot return to the old ways of conflict and coercion. \r\nWe cannot look backwards. We live in an integrated \r\nworld, one in which we all have a stake in one another’s \r\nsuccess.\r\nWe cannot turn back those forces of integration. No \r\nnation here in the Assembly can insulate itself from the \r\nthreat of terrorism, the risk of financial contagion, the \r\nf low of migrants or the danger of a warming planet. \r\nThe disorder we see is not driven solely by competition \r\nbetween nations or by any single ideology. If we cannot \r\nwork together more effectively, we will all suffer the \r\nconsequences.\r\nThat is true for the United States as well. No matter \r\nhow powerful our military, how strong our economy, we \r\nunderstand the United States cannot solve the world’s \r\nproblems alone. In Iraq, the United States learned the \r\nhard lesson that even with hundreds of thousands of \r\nbrave, effective troops and trillions of dollars from \r\nour Treasury, it cannot by itself impose stability on a \r\nforeign land. Unless we work with other nations under \r\nthe mantle of international norms, principles and \r\nlaw that offers legitimacy to our efforts, we will not \r\nsucceed. And unless we work together to defeat the \r\nideas that drive the various communities in a country \r\nlike Iraq into conflict, any order that our militaries can \r\nimpose will be temporary.\r\nJust as force alone cannot impose order \r\ninternationally, I believe in my core that repression \r\ncannot forge the social cohesion that nations need to \r\nsucceed. The history of the last two decades proves \r\nthat in today’s world, dictatorships are unstable. The \r\nstrongmen of today become the spark of revolution \r\ntomorrow. You can jail your opponents, but you \r\ncannot imprison ideas. You can try to control access to \r\ninformation, but you cannot turn a lie into truth. It is not \r\na conspiracy of United States-backed non-governmental \r\norganizations that exposes corruption and raises \r\nthe expectations of people around the globe — it is \r\ntechnology, social media and the irreducible desire of \r\npeople everywhere to make their own choices about \r\nhow they are governed.\r\nIndeed, I believe that in today’s world, the measure \r\nof strength is no longer defined by the control of \r\nterritory. Lasting prosperity does not come solely from \r\nthe ability to access and extract raw materials. The \r\nstrength of nations depends on the success of their \r\npeople — their knowledge, innovation, imagination, \r\ncreativity, drive and opportunity — and that, in turn, \r\ndepends on individual rights, good governance and \r\npersonal security. Both internal repression and foreign \r\naggression are symptoms of a failure to provide that \r\nfoundation.\r\nPolitics and solidarity that depend on demonizing \r\nothers, that draw on religious sectarianism, narrow \r\ntribalism or jingoism, may at times look like strength \r\nin the moment, but over time their weakness will be \r\nexposed. And history tells us that the dark forces \r\nunleashed by this type of politics surely make all of us \r\nless secure. Our world has been there before. We gain \r\nnothing from going back.\r\nInstead, I believe that we must go forward in pursuit \r\nof our ideals, not abandon them at this critical time. We \r\nmust give expression to our best hopes, not our deepest \r\nfears. This institution was founded because men and \r\nwomen who came before us had the foresight to know \r\nthat our nations are more secure when we uphold basic \r\nlaws and norms and pursue a path of cooperation rather \r\nthan conflict. And strong nations, above all, have a \r\nresponsibility to uphold that international order.\r\nLet me give a concrete example. After I took office, \r\nI made it clear that one of the principal achievements \r\nof the United Nations — the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime — was endangered by Iran’s violation of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nOn that basis, the Security Council tightened sanctions \r\non the Iranian Government, and many nations joined \r\nus to enforce them. Together, we showed that laws and \r\nagreements mean something. But we also understood \r\nthat the goal of sanctions was not simply to punish Iran. \r\nOur objective was to test whether Iran could change \r\ncourse, accept constraints and allow the world to \r\nverify that its nuclear programme would be peaceful. \r\nFor two years, the United States and our partners, \r\nincluding Russia and China, stuck together in complex \r\nnegotiations. The result is a lasting, comprehensive \r\ndeal that prevents Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon \r\nwhile allowing it to access peaceful energy. If the deal is \r\nfully implemented, the prohibition on nuclear weapons \r\nis strengthened, a potential war is averted and our world \r\nis safer. That is the strength of the international system \r\nwhen it works the way it should.\r\nThat same fidelity to international order guides \r\nour responses to other challenges around the world. \r\n12/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nConsider Russia’s annexation of Crimea and further \r\naggression in eastern Ukraine. America has few \r\neconomic interests in Ukraine, and we recognize the \r\ndeep and complex history between Russia and Ukraine. \r\nBut we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of a nation is f lagrantly violated. \r\nIf that happens without consequence in Ukraine, it \r\ncould happen to any of the nations gathered here today. \r\nThat is the basis of the sanctions that the United States \r\nand our partners impose on Russia. It is not a desire to \r\nreturn to a cold war.\r\nNow, within Russia, State-controlled media may \r\ndescribe those events as an example of a resurgent \r\nRussia — a view shared, by the way, by a number of \r\nUnited States politicians and commentators who have \r\nalways been deeply sceptical about Russia and seem \r\nto be convinced that a new cold war is in fact upon \r\nus. And yet look at the results. The Ukrainian people \r\nare more interested than ever in aligning with Europe \r\ninstead of Russia. Sanctions have led to capital f light, a \r\ncontracting economy, a fallen rouble and the emigration \r\nof more educated Russians.\r\nImagine if, instead, Russia had engaged in \r\ntrue diplomacy and worked with Ukraine and the \r\ninternational community to ensure that its interests \r\nwere protected. That would be better for Ukraine, but \r\nalso better for Russia and better for the world, which is \r\nwhy we continue to press for this crisis to be resolved in \r\na way that allows a sovereign and democratic Ukraine to \r\ndetermine its future and control its territory. This is not \r\nbecause we want to isolate Russia — we do not — but \r\nbecause we want a strong Russia that is invested in \r\nworking with us to strengthen the international system \r\nas a whole.\r\nSimilarly, in the South China Sea, the United States \r\nmakes no claim on territory there. We do not adjudicate \r\nclaims. But like every nation gathered here, we have \r\nan interest in upholding the basic principles of freedom \r\nof navigation and the free f low of commerce, and in \r\nresolving disputes through international law, not the \r\nlaw of force. So we will defend those principles, while \r\nencouraging China and other claimants to resolve their \r\ndifferences peacefully. I say this while recognizing \r\nthat diplomacy is hard, the outcomes are sometimes \r\nunsatisfying and it is rarely politically popular. But I \r\nbelieve that leaders of large nations in particular have \r\nan obligation to take those risks, precisely because we \r\nare strong enough to protect our interests if and when \r\ndiplomacy fails.\r\nI also believe that to move forward in this new \r\nera, we have to be strong enough to acknowledge \r\nwhen what we are doing is not working. For 50 years, \r\nthe United States pursued a Cuba policy that failed to \r\nimprove the lives of the Cuban people. We changed \r\nthat. We continue to have differences with the Cuban \r\nGovernment. We will continue to stand up for human \r\nrights. But we address those issues through diplomatic \r\nrelations, increased commerce and people-to-people \r\nties. As those contacts yield progress, I am confident \r\nthat our Congress will inevitably lift an embargo that \r\nshould not be in place any more. Change will not come \r\novernight to Cuba, but I am confident that openness, \r\nnot coercion, will support the reforms and the better \r\nlife that the Cuban people deserve, just as I believe that \r\nCuba will find its success if it pursues cooperation with \r\nother nations.\r\nNow, if it is in the interest of major Powers to \r\nuphold international standards, that is even more true \r\nfor the rest of the community of nations. Look around \r\nthe world. From Singapore to Colombia to Senegal, \r\nthe facts show that nations succeed when they pursue \r\nan inclusive peace and prosperity within their borders \r\nand work cooperatively with countries beyond those \r\nborders.\r\nThat path is now available to a nation such as  Iran, \r\nwhich, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent \r\nproxies to advance its interests. Those efforts may \r\nappear to give it leverage in disputes with its neighbours, \r\nbut they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the \r\nentire region and isolates Iran from the promise of \r\ntrade and commerce. The Iranian people have a proud \r\nhistory and are filled with extraordinary potential. But \r\nchanting “Death to America” does not create jobs or \r\nmake Iran more secure. If Iran chooses a different path, \r\nthat will be good for the security of the region, good for \r\nthe Iranian people and good for the world.\r\nOf course, around the globe, we will continue to \r\nbe confronted with nations that reject these lessons of \r\nhistory — places where civil strife, border disputes \r\nand sectarian wars give rise to terrorist enclaves and \r\nhumanitarian disasters. Where order has completely \r\nbroken down, we must act, but we will be stronger \r\nwhen we act together.\r\nIn such efforts, the United States will always do \r\nits part. We will do so mindful of the lessons of the \r\npast — not just the lessons of Iraq, but also the example \r\nof Libya, where we joined an international coalition \r\n15-29265 13/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nunder a United Nations mandate to prevent a slaughter. \r\nEven as we helped the Libyan people bring an end to the \r\nreign of a tyrant, our coalition could have and should \r\nhave done more to fill a vacuum left behind. We are \r\ngrateful to the United Nations for its efforts to forge a \r\nunity Government. We will help any legitimate Libyan \r\nGovernment as it works to bring the country together.\r\nWe also have to recognize that we must work more \r\neffectively in the future, as an international community, \r\nto build capacity for States that are in distress before \r\nthey collapse. That is why we should celebrate the fact \r\nthat, later today, the United States will join with more \r\nthan 50 countries to enlist new capabilities — infantry, \r\nintelligence, helicopters, hospitals, and tens of \r\nthousands of troops — to strengthen United Nations \r\npeacekeeping. These new capabilities can prevent mass \r\nkilling and ensure that peace agreements are more than \r\nwords on paper. But we have to do it together. Together, \r\nwe must strengthen our collective capacity to establish \r\nsecurity where order has broken down and to support \r\nthose who seek a just and lasting peace.\r\nNowhere is our commitment to international order \r\nmore tested than in Syria. When a dictator slaughters \r\ntens of thousands of his own people, that is not just a \r\nmatter of one nation’s internal affairs. It breeds human \r\nsuffering on an order of magnitude that affects us all. \r\nLikewise, when a terrorist group beheads captives, \r\nslaughters the innocent and enslaves women, that is \r\nnot a single nation’s national security problem. It is an \r\nassault on humankind as a whole.\r\nI have said before and I will repeat: there is no room \r\nto accommodate an apocalyptic cult like the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), and the United \r\nStates makes no apologies for using our military, as \r\npart of a broad coalition, to go after them. We do so \r\nwith a determination to ensure that there will never be a \r\nsafe haven for terrorists who carry out these crimes. We \r\nhave demonstrated over more than a decade of relentless \r\npursuit of Al-Qaida that we will not be outlasted by \r\nextremists.\r\nWhile military power is necessary, it is not \r\nsufficient to resolve the situation in Syria. Lasting \r\nstability can take hold only when the people of Syria \r\nforge an agreement to live together peacefully. The \r\nUnited States is prepared to work with any nation, \r\nincluding Russia and Iran, to resolve the conflict. But \r\nwe must recognize that after so much bloodshed, so \r\nmuch carnage, there cannot be a return to the pre-war \r\nstatus quo.\r\nLet us remember how this started. Al-Assad reacted \r\nto peaceful protests by escalating repression and killing \r\nthat, in turn, created the environment for the current \r\nstrife. And so Al-Assad and his allies cannot simply \r\npacify the broad majority of a population that has been \r\nbrutalized by chemical weapons and indiscriminate \r\nbombing. Yes, realism dictates that compromise will be \r\nrequired to end the fighting and, ultimately, stamp out \r\nISIL. But realism also requires a managed transition \r\naway from Al-Assad and to a new leader, and an \r\ninclusive Government that recognizes there must be an \r\nend to this chaos so that the Syrian people can begin to \r\nrebuild.\r\nWe know that ISIL — which emerged out of the \r\nchaos of Iraq and Syria — depends on perpetual war \r\nto survive, but we also know that they gain adherents \r\nbecause of a poisonous ideology. Part of our job, \r\ntogether, is to work to reject such extremism that infects \r\ntoo many of our young people. Part of that effort must be \r\na continued rejection by Muslims of those who distort \r\nIslam to preach intolerance and promote violence. It \r\nmust also involve a rejection by non-Muslims of the \r\nignorance that equates Islam with terrorism.\r\nThis work will take time. There are no easy answers \r\nto Syria, and there are no simple answers to the changes \r\nthat are taking place in much of the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa. But so many families need help right now; \r\nthey do not have time. That is why the United States is \r\nincreasing the number of refugees whom we welcome \r\nwithin our borders. That is why we will continue to \r\nbe the largest donor of assistance to support those \r\nrefugees. Today we are launching new efforts to ensure \r\nthat our people and our businesses, our universities and \r\nour non-governmental organizations can help as well, \r\nbecause in the faces of suffering families, our nation of \r\nimmigrants sees itself.\r\nOf course, in the old ways of thinking, the plight \r\nof the powerless, the plight of refugees, the plight of \r\nthe marginalized did not matter. They were on the \r\nperiphery of the world’s concerns. Today, our concern \r\nfor them is driven not just by conscience, but should \r\nalso be driven by self-interest. Helping people who have \r\nbeen pushed to the margins of our world is not mere \r\ncharity; it is a matter of collective security. The purpose \r\nof this institution is not merely to avoid conflict; it is \r\nto galvanize the collective action that makes life better \r\non this planet.\r\nThe commitments we have made to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals speak to this truth. I believe that \r\n14/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\ncapitalism has been the greatest creator of wealth and \r\nopportunity that the world has ever known. But from \r\nbig cities to rural villages around the world, we also \r\nknow that prosperity is still cruelly out of reach for too \r\nmany. As His Holiness Pope Francis reminds us, we are \r\nstronger when we value the least among these and see \r\nthem as equal in dignity to ourselves and our sons and \r\nour daughters.\r\nWe can roll back preventable disease and end the \r\nscourge of HIV/AIDS. We can stamp out pandemics \r\nthat recognize no borders. That work may not be \r\non television right now, but as we demonstrated in \r\nreversing the spread of Ebola, it can save more lives \r\nthan anything else we can do. Together, we can eradicate \r\nextreme poverty and erase barriers to opportunity. But \r\nthis requires a sustained commitment to our people so \r\nfarmers can feed more people, so entrepreneurs can \r\nstart a business without paying a bribe, so young people \r\nhave the skills they need to succeed in this modern, \r\nknowledge-based economy.\r\nWe can promote growth through trade that meets a \r\nhigher standard, and that is what we are doing through \r\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership — a trade agreement that \r\nencompasses nearly 40 per cent of the global economy, \r\nan agreement that will open markets while protecting \r\nthe rights of workers and protecting the environment \r\nthat enables development to be sustained.\r\nWe can roll back the pollution that we put in our \r\nskies and help economies lift people out of poverty \r\nwithout condemning our children to the ravages of \r\nan ever-warming climate. The same ingenuity that \r\nproduced the Industrial Age and the Computer Age \r\nallows us to harness the potential of clean energy. No \r\ncountry can escape the ravages of climate change. And \r\nthere is no stronger sign of leadership than putting \r\nfuture generations first. The United States will work \r\nwith every nation that is willing to do its part so that \r\nwe can come together in Paris to decisively confront \r\nthis challenge.\r\nFinally, regarding our vision for the future of \r\nthe Assembly, my belief in moving forward rather \r\nthan backwards requires us to defend the democratic \r\nprinciples that allow societies to succeed. Let me start \r\nfrom a simple premise. Catastrophes like what we are \r\nseeing in Syria do not take place in countries where \r\nthere is genuine democracy and respect for the universal \r\nvalues this institution is supposed to defend.\r\nI recognize that democracy is going to take \r\ndifferent forms in different parts of the world. The very \r\nidea of a people governing themselves depends upon \r\ngovernment giving expression to their unique culture, \r\ntheir unique history, their unique experiences. But \r\nsome universal truths are self-evident. No person wants \r\nto be imprisoned for peaceful worship. No woman \r\nshould ever be abused with impunity, no girl should be \r\nbarred from attending school. There should be freedom \r\nto peacefully petition those in power without fear of \r\narbitrary laws. These are not ideas of one country or \r\none culture. They are fundamental to human progress. \r\nThey are a cornerstone of this institution.\r\nI realize that in many parts of the world there is a \r\ndifferent view — a belief that strong leadership must \r\ntolerate no dissent. I hear it not only from America’s \r\nadversaries, but — privately, at least — I also hear \r\nit from some of our friends. I disagree. I believe a \r\nGovernment that suppresses peaceful dissent is not \r\nshowing strength. It is showing weakness and it is \r\nshowing fear.\r\nHistory shows that regimes that fear their own \r\npeople will eventually crumble, but strong institutions \r\nbuilt on the consent of the governed endure long after \r\nany one individual is gone. That is why our strongest \r\nleaders, from George Washington to Nelson Mandela, \r\nhave elevated the importance of building strong, \r\ndemocratic institutions over a thirst for perpetual \r\npower. Leaders who amend constitutions to stay in \r\noffice only acknowledge that they failed to build a \r\nsuccessful country for their people, because none of us \r\nlasts forever. It tells us that power is something they \r\ncling to for its own sake rather than for the betterment \r\nof those whom they purport to serve.\r\nI understand that democracy is frustrating. \r\nDemocracy in the United States is certainly imperfect. \r\nAt times it can be dysfunctional. But democracy — the \r\nconstant struggle to extend rights to more of our people, \r\nto give more people a voice — is what allowed us to \r\nbecome the most powerful nation in the world. It is not \r\nsimply a matter of principle; it is not an abstraction. \r\nDemocracy, inclusive democracy, makes countries \r\nstronger. When opposition parties can seek power \r\npeacefully through the ballot, a country draws upon \r\nnew ideas. When a free media can inform the public, \r\ncorruption and abuse are exposed and can be rooted \r\nout. When civil society thrives, communities can solve \r\nproblems that Governments cannot necessarily solve \r\nalone. When immigrants are welcomed, countries are \r\n15-29265 15/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nmore productive and more vibrant. When girls can go \r\nto school, get a job and pursue unlimited opportunities, \r\nthat is when a country realizes its full potential.\r\nThat is what I believe is America’s greatest strength. \r\nNot everybody in America agrees with me. That is part \r\nof democracy. I believe that the fact that one can walk \r\nthe streets of this city right now and pass churches and \r\nsynagogues and temples and mosques where people \r\nworship freely; the fact that our nation of immigrants \r\nmirrors the diversity of the world — one can find people \r\nfrom everywhere here in New York City — the fact that \r\nin this country everybody can contribute, everybody \r\ncan participate no matter who they are or what they \r\nlook like or whom they love — that is what makes us \r\nstrong.\r\nI believe that what is true for America is true for \r\nvirtually all mature democracies. That is no accident. \r\nWe can be proud of our nations without defining \r\nourselves in opposition to some other group. We can \r\nbe patriotic without demonizing someone else. We \r\ncan cherish our own identities — our religion, our \r\nethnicity, our traditions — without putting others \r\ndown. Our systems are premised on the notion that \r\nabsolute power will corrupt, but that people, ordinary \r\npeople, are fundamentally good and value family and \r\nfriendship, faith and the dignity of hard work. And \r\nwith appropriate checks and balances, Governments \r\ncan reflect that goodness. I believe that is the future we \r\nmust seek together — to believe in the dignity of every \r\nindividual, to believe we can bridge our differences \r\nand choose cooperation over conflict. That is not \r\nweakness; that is strength. It is a practical necessity in \r\nour interconnected world.\r\nOur people understand this. Think of the Liberian \r\ndoctor who went door to door to search for Ebola cases \r\nand to tell families what to do if they show symptoms. \r\nThink of the Iranian shopkeeper who said after the \r\nnuclear deal, “God willing, now we will be able to \r\noffer many more goods at better prices”. Think of the \r\nAmericans who lowered the f lag over our embassy in \r\nHavana in 1961, the year I was born, and who returned \r\nthis summer to raise that f lag back up. One of those \r\nmen said of the Cuban people, “We could do things for \r\nthem, and they could do things for us. We loved them”. \r\nFor 50 years we ignored that fact. Think of the families \r\nleaving everything they have known behind, risking \r\nbarren deserts and stormy waters just to find shelter, \r\njust to save their children. One Syrian refugee who was \r\nmet in Hamburg with warm greetings and shelter said, \r\n“We feel there are still some people who love other \r\npeople”.\r\nThe people of our United Nations are not as different \r\nas they have been told. They can be made to fear; they \r\ncan be taught to hate, but they can also respond to hope. \r\nHistory is littered with the failure of false prophets and \r\nfallen empires who believed that might always makes \r\nright. That will continue to be the case. We can count \r\non it. But we are called upon to offer a different type \r\nof leadership, a leadership strong enough to recognize \r\nthat nations share common interests and people share \r\na common humanity. And, yes, there are certain ideas \r\nand principles that are universal. That is what those who \r\nshaped the United Nations 70 years ago understood. Let \r\nus carry that faith forward into the future, for it is the \r\nonly way we can ensure that the future will be brighter, \r\nfor my children and for everyone’s children.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrzej Duda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andrzej Duda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly\r\nPresident Duda (spoke in Polish; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): I congratulate the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, on his election to that \r\nhonourable office. I wish to assure you, Mr. President, \r\nof Poland’s full support for your actions.\r\nPeace and law: those are the two key words that \r\nenable us to understand and appreciate the importance \r\nof the United Nations over past 70 years in the world’s \r\nhistory. Peace and law, two words without which it \r\nis impossible to imagine the coexistence of nations, \r\n16/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\ndifferent ethnic groups and the followers of the various \r\nreligions. Peace and law: they are beautiful and \r\nimportant concepts, but extremely fragile ones that we \r\nneed to take care of and to cultivate unceasingly.\r\nWe Poles know full well that peace is not to be \r\ntaken for granted. Less than one month ago, it was \r\nincumbent on me, as President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, to deliver a speech at the commemoration of \r\nthe seventy-sixth anniversary of the outbreak of the \r\nSecond World War. At dawn on 1 September 1939, the \r\ninvasion of Nazi Germany against my home country \r\nwas unleashed. Seventeen days later, on 17 September \r\n1939, we received a blow from the other side, when the \r\nUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics attacked Poland, \r\nand Poland vanished from the map. However, the Poles \r\nare a proud nation, and they did not give up, because \r\nwhat they love, above all, is freedom. That is why they \r\nfought, to the end, on the side of the free world.\r\nThe Second World War, the greatest and bloodiest \r\nin the history of humankind, caused the whole of \r\nEurope, East and South-East Asia, North Africa, the \r\nMiddle East and all the oceans to plunge into the dark \r\nreign of crime, barbarity and suffering. International \r\nlaw fell, as one of the first victims of the war back then. \r\nThe next victim was human rights, starting from the \r\nfundamental right to live and ending with the rights of \r\nsoldiers in combat, the rights of civilians crushed under \r\nbombing raids and the rights of refugees. The scale of \r\nterror, destruction and lawlessness committed during \r\nthose days put the international community to a serious \r\ntest. The need appeared to step up efforts to protect \r\npeace and safeguard it for the future.\r\nThe year 1945 marked more than the end of the \r\nSecond World War; it was also the birth year of the \r\nUnited Nations, the most fundamental mechanism \r\nfor cooperation within the international community, \r\nadvocating for global peace and security. In 1945, \r\ninternational criminal courts were established in \r\nNuremberg and Tokyo. Lastly, the 1940s also marked \r\nthe adoption of two particularly crucial documents: \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide, the concept of which was largely \r\nformulated by Raphael Lemkin, a great Pole of Jewish \r\ndescent, an eminent lawyer and university lecturer \r\nand a nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. Lemkin was \r\nf luent in nine languages, but he was most f luent in the \r\nlanguage of law. He noted the absence of an important \r\nword. It was Lemkin who invented and applied the term \r\nof genocide in legal language for the first time. The \r\nPolish lawyer had direct experience of genocide: almost \r\nall of his family perished — murdered in the German \r\ncamps of annihilation.\r\nThe emphasis on the respect for international \r\nlaw, as well as the unconditional punishment of those \r\nresponsible for war crimes, was meant to be one of \r\nthe ways and means to prevent bloody conflicts in the \r\nfuture. As Pope John Paul II observed, “Peace and \r\ninternational law are closely linked to each other; law \r\nfavours peace”. Unfortunately, international treaties \r\nare still being violated, solemn pledges are being \r\nneglected, and human rights are commonly being \r\ntrampled. We should constantly recall that fact. We can \r\nnever be reminded too often that international law is a \r\nfundamental value and a fundamental tool for building \r\npeace in the world and that no declarations made by \r\nthe leaders of States, no promises, no entreaties, can \r\nreplace treaties, conventions and resolutions. No \r\nnegotiations behind closed doors may ever lead to \r\nthe violation and trampling of international law and \r\nresolutions. All States should be afforded the equal \r\nenjoyment of the rights vested in them, and any actions \r\nundermining those rules should be firmly rejected by \r\nthe international community.\r\nPoland, so gravely affected by the Second World \r\nWar and by over 40 years of oppression from the \r\ncommunist regime, is particularly sensitive to the use \r\nof force in the relations between States, the use of \r\narmed aggression and the violation of human rights. \r\nPoland feels an obligation to remind everyone that \r\nsuch methods are not only immoral and incompatible \r\nwith the broadly understood concept of humanism, but \r\nabove all, they violate international law. That is why \r\nI would like to forcefully reiterate that, when a State \r\nperpetrates an act of aggression, basing its foreign \r\npolicy on faits accomplis through the use of tanks, \r\nmissiles and bombs, the international community has \r\nan obligation to reject the facts created through such \r\nmeans.\r\nIn that regard, it is crucially important to continue \r\nto work on streamlining the effectiveness of the \r\nSecurity Council, the body responsible for protecting \r\ninternational peace. It must be constantly recalled that \r\nthe privilege of permanent membership is connected \r\nwith the duty to take active measures to implement the \r\nfundamental goals of the United Nations as set forth in \r\nArticle 1 of the Charter. In recent years, the right to the \r\nveto has led, on many occasions, to a total stalemate \r\n15-29265 17/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nin the Council’s work, precisely on the most important \r\nsecurity issues. That is why Poland supports the French \r\nproposal to adopt a code of conduct for refraining from \r\nthe use of the veto when members are confronted by the \r\ngravest crimes under international law, including the \r\ncrime of genocide.\r\nLet us look at the world today, which is so assailed \r\nby trouble. With millions of people suffering from war, \r\ndestitution, famine and religious persecutions, can we \r\nafford to circumvent the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter? Should we be turning a blind eye to breaches \r\nof existing commitments or to actions taken from a \r\nposition of power or based on faits accomplis? Should \r\nwe wave aside manipulations of the law and propaganda \r\nactivities that seek to justify base and illegal actions? \r\nThe answer is no, and that must be the answer of every \r\ndecent and honest human being and politician.\r\nThe former President of the Republic of Poland, \r\nProfessor Lech Kaczyński, addressing the Assembly in \r\nthis Hall back in 2009, pointed out that the violation \r\nof the territorial integrity of States always gives rise \r\nto conflicts on a global scale (see A/64/PV.4). In my \r\ncapacity as President of Poland, I would also like to \r\nexpress, on behalf of my country, my opposition to a \r\nworld built on a division into zones of influence, and \r\nmy rejection of acts of aggression perpetrated by those \r\nwho, driven by their interests and ambitions, ignore \r\nthe provisions of international law, thereby thwarting \r\nthe collective work of the United Nations over the past \r\n70 years. In our part of Europe, we know all too well \r\nthe costs to be incurred as the result of such policies, \r\nespecially in the absence of a decisive reaction and \r\nthe solidarity of other States in the early stages of an \r\naggression.\r\nContempt for international law may turn out, in \r\nfact, to be one of the seeds of war. And once war has \r\nbroken out, there is generally no rule of law in the \r\nterritories overwhelmed by warfare. We see that in the \r\nMiddle East, where State institutions have been either \r\nexcessively strained or replaced by private armies, \r\nterrorist militias and self-proclaimed courts. That \r\nconstitutes yet another challenge to both the world \r\nand the United Nations. With increasing frequency, \r\nconflicts arise in which it is almost impossible to define \r\nthe opposing sides and in which combat is carried out \r\nnot by States, but rather by indeterminate armed groups \r\nin which it is difficult to distinguish a soldier from a \r\ncivilian. How are we to adjust existing regulations to \r\ndeal with such new circumstances, which, in the eyes \r\nof many politicians and specialists in international law, \r\nhave still not been fully researched and understood?\r\nUnfortunately, one thing has remained unchanged \r\nfor centuries: in various parts of the world, in numerous \r\nconflict situations, the freedom of conscience and \r\nreligion are systematically restrained. Members of \r\nreligious minorities, nowadays especially Christians, \r\nare exposed to persecution. In the Middle East, the \r\nincidence of acts of violence targeting members of \r\nChristian churches is growing at an alarming pace. Nor \r\nshould we forget the plight of the Yazidi community, \r\nwhich has been murdered and evicted from its native \r\nsoil. Poland appeals to the international community \r\nto take decisive steps to protect the rights of religious \r\nminorities.\r\nMilitary conflicts in the Middle East are taking \r\na toll of thousands of innocent lives and violating \r\nthe social and economic stability of the region. The \r\nmilitants of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the \r\nLevant continue to pillage museums, defile Christian \r\nand Shia shrines, and blow up the remains of ancient \r\nmetropolises. At the end of August, we were informed \r\nabout the destruction of temple Baal Shamin in \r\nPalmyra, a monument with 2,000 years of tradition. \r\nUNESCO Director General Irina Bokova has stated \r\nthat the devastation of that temple constitutes nothing \r\nless than a war crime. In the face of those beastly acts, \r\nthe international community should take more decisive \r\nsteps in order to stem the practice of destroying and \r\nlooting the world heritage of humanity.\r\nNever since the start of the United Nations has the \r\ninternational community had to address a humanitarian \r\ncrisis on a scale such as the one it faces today. Poland is \r\nworking to reinforce the global system of humanitarian \r\naid by fostering cooperation among international \r\ninstitutions, Governments, law enforcement and \r\nnongovernmental organizations. At the same time, \r\nthere needs to be greater emphasis on the relationship \r\nbetween humanitarian aid and aid for development. \r\nHere, I would like to mention with great satisfaction \r\nthe contribution of Polish humanitarian organizations, \r\nwhich actively support those in need. They have built \r\nschools and welfare centres, drilled wells, provided \r\nclothing and blankets, assisted the victims of conflicts \r\nand responded in the wake of natural disasters. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to express my sincerest \r\ngratitude to all good-hearted people and to the people \r\nof conscience who are providing assistance to others, \r\noften at the risk of their own lives.\r\n18/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nRespect for human rights is a key premise for the \r\nmaintenance of peace and justice in the lives of States \r\nand nations.\r\nFor Poland, the defence of the freedom of \r\nconscience, worship and speech is of particular \r\nimportance. And the freedom of speech entails the \r\nduty to tell the truth. Nothing is more poisonous to the \r\nrelations among peoples and States than manipulating \r\nthe truth or spreading lies and degrading stereotypes. \r\nThat is why the truth, including the truth about history, \r\nis such a crucial component of relations among States \r\nand nations.\r\nHere, I would like to highlight the fate of those \r\nfor whom standing up for truth and for freedom of \r\nspeech has often been punished with imprisonment \r\nor even death at the hands of their oppressors — the \r\ncourageous and uncompromising dissidents, journalists \r\nand bloggers who expose the crimes of totalitarian \r\nregimes, the atrocities perpetrated by terrorists in \r\nvarious corners of the world and the brutality of law \r\nenforcement authorities. We must not forget their \r\ndedication. The international community should offer \r\nthem appropriate protection, including legal protection.\r\nAnd there is another social group that cannot be \r\nleft out when we speak about human rights, or about the \r\neffects of war and mass migration. I am thinking here \r\nof women: the mothers, wives and daughters of Asia, \r\nAfrica, the Middle East and Ukraine. They require our \r\nparticular attention, because they suffer doubly: first, \r\nwhen they lose their sense of security, with war raging \r\naround them, and then when they lose their husbands, \r\nfathers, brothers or sons, sometimes without even being \r\nable to bury them. The tears of bereft women, victims \r\nof war, pose the greatest charge against humanity in the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nThe defence of democracy, sustainable economic \r\ngrowth, the elimination of social inequalities, broader \r\naccess to education and the long-term mitigation of \r\nthe impacts of climate change — all those measures \r\ncontribute to the preservation of world peace. In \r\nthat context, I wish to assure the Assembly of my \r\ncountry’s readiness to participate in the attainment of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1). \r\nPoland has, among other things, actively participated in \r\nthe current international effort to achieve a new climate \r\nagreement. We see the need to reach a permanent \r\nunderstanding in that field, one that will be joined by \r\nall States and will engage the efforts of all States in \r\nproportion to their actual capabilities. In other ways, \r\nPoland has had an impressive track record with regard \r\nto environmental protection. Suffice it to say that \r\nour economic transformation has contributed to the \r\nlowering of carbon dioxide emissions in Poland by \r\n30 per cent since 1990.\r\nWe also stand ready to increase our direct \r\ncontribution to peacekeeping and the preservation of \r\nsecurity. In that spirit, we have submitted our candidacy \r\nto be a non-permanent member of the Security Council. \r\nPoland, still mindful of the tragedy of the Second \r\nWorld War and the communist era, pledges to actively \r\ncooperate in building an international order based \r\non the rule of law. Law contributes to the effective \r\nfunctioning of the societies of which our States are \r\ncomposed. But it also serves to help establish effective \r\nand peaceful arrangements among States themselves. \r\nLet us therefore create a world founded on the strength \r\nof the rule of law and not on the law of force.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Poland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic of \r\nPoland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Xi Jinping, President of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the People’s Republic of \r\nChina.\r\nMr. Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic \r\nof China, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Xi Jinping, President of the People’s \r\nRepublic of China, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Xi Jinping (spoke in Chinese): Just \r\n70 years ago, an earlier generation fought heroically and \r\nsecured victory in an anti-fascist war, thereby ending \r\na dark chapter in the annals of human history. That \r\nvictory was hard won. Seventy years ago, humankind, \r\nacting with vision and foresight, established the United \r\nNations. That universal and most representative and \r\nauthoritative international Organization has carried \r\nhumankind’s hope for a new future and ushered in a new \r\n15-29265 19/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nera of cooperation. It was a pioneering initiative never \r\nundertaken before. Seventy years ago, that generation \r\npooled their wisdom to adopt the Charter of the United \r\nNations, laying the cornerstone for the contemporary \r\ninternational order and establishing the fundamental \r\nprinciples of contemporary international relations. It \r\nwas an achievement of profound impact.\r\nOn 3 September, the Chinese people, together with \r\nother peoples of the world, solemnly commemorated \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the Chinese people’s war \r\nof resistance against Japanese aggression and fascism \r\nin the Second World War. In the main theatre in the \r\nEast, China made a national sacrifice, suffering over \r\n35 million casualties in its fight against the main troops \r\nof Japanese militarism. China not only saved itself and \r\nits people from subjugation, but also gave strong support \r\nto the forces fighting aggression in the European and \r\nPacific theatres, thereby making a historic contribution \r\nto the victory in that anti-fascist world war.\r\nHistory is like a mirror. Only by drawing on the \r\nlessons of history can the world avoid repeating past \r\ncalamities. We should review history with respect \r\nand in full conscience. The past cannot be changed, \r\nbut the future can be shaped. Bearing history in mind \r\nis not to perpetuate hatred. Rather, it is necessary so \r\nthat humankind does not forget history’s lessons. \r\nRemembering history does not mean being obsessed \r\nwith the past; rather, in doing so, we aim to create a \r\nbetter future and pass the torch of peace from generation \r\nto generation.\r\nThe United Nations has survived the test of time. \r\nOver the past seven decades, it has witnessed the efforts \r\nof all countries to uphold peace, build homelands and \r\npursue cooperation. Having reached a historic new \r\nstarting point, the United Nations needs to address the \r\ncentral issue of how to better promote world peace and \r\ndevelopment in the twenty-first century. The world is \r\nexperiencing a historic process of accelerated evolution. \r\nThe sunshine of peace, development and progress will \r\nbe powerful enough to penetrate the clouds of war, \r\npoverty and backwardness. The movement towards \r\na multipolar world and the rise of emerging markets \r\nand developing countries have become an irreversible \r\nhistorical trend. Economic globalization with the \r\nadvent of the information age has unleashed and \r\ngreatly boosted social productive forces that have both \r\ncreated unprecedented development opportunities and \r\ngiven rise to new threats and challenges that we must \r\nsquarely face.\r\nAs an ancient Chinese goes, “Our greatest ideal is to \r\ncreate a world truly shared by all”. Peace, development, \r\nequity, justice, democracy and freedom are the \r\ncommon values of humankind and the lofty goals of \r\nthe United Nations. Yet those goals are far from having \r\nbeen achieved, and we must continue our endeavours \r\nto meet them. In today’s world, all countries are \r\ninterdependent and share a common future. We should \r\nrenew our commitment to the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, so as to fashion \r\na new kind of international relations with win-win \r\ncooperation at its core and to create an international \r\ncommunity that realizes a shared positive future for all \r\nof humankind. To achieve that goal, we need to make \r\nthe following efforts. \r\nWe should build partnerships in which countries \r\ntreat each other as equals, engage in mutual consultation \r\nand show mutual understanding. The principle of \r\nsovereign equality underpins the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The future of the world must be shaped by all \r\ncountries. All countries are equals. Those who are big, \r\nstrong and rich should not bully the small, weak and \r\npoor. The principle of sovereignty not only means that \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries \r\nare inviolable and that their internal affairs are not \r\nsubject to interference. It also means that the right of \r\nall countries to independently choose social systems \r\nand development paths should be upheld and that the \r\nendeavours of all countries to promote economic and \r\nsocial development and to improve their people’s lives \r\nshould be respected.\r\nWe should be committed to multilateralism and \r\nreject unilateralism. We should adopt a new vision of \r\nseeking win-win outcomes for all and reject the outdated \r\nmindset that one’s gain means the other’s loss or that \r\nthe winner takes all. Consultation is an important form \r\nof democracy, and it should also become an important \r\nmeans of exercising contemporary international \r\ngovernance. We should resolve disputes and differences \r\nthrough dialogue and consultation. We should forge \r\na global partnership at both the international and \r\nregional levels, and embrace a new approach to \r\nState-to-State relations, one that features dialogue \r\nrather than confrontation and seeks partnership rather \r\nthan alliance.\r\nMajor countries should follow the principles of no \r\nconflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win \r\ncooperation in handling their relations. Big countries \r\nshould treat small countries as equals and take the right \r\n20/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\napproach to justice and interests by putting justice \r\nbefore interests.\r\nWe should create a security architecture featuring \r\nfairness, justice, joint contributions and shared benefits. \r\nIn an age of economic globalization, the security of \r\nall countries is interlinked and has a mutual impact. \r\nNo country can maintain absolute security by its own \r\nefforts alone, and no country can achieve stability on \r\nthe basis of other countries’ instability. The law of the \r\njungle leaves the weak at the mercy of the strong; that \r\nis not the way for countries to conduct their relations. \r\nThose who adopt the high-handed approach of using \r\nforce will find that they are only lifting a rock to drop \r\nit on their own feet.\r\nWe should abandon the Cold War mentality in all \r\nits manifestations and foster a new vision of common, \r\ncomprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. \r\nWe should give full play to the central role of the United \r\nNations and its Security Council in ending conflict and \r\nkeeping peace, and adopt the dual approach of seeking \r\npeaceful solutions to disputes and taking the actions \r\nrequired to turn hostility into amity.\r\nWe should advance international cooperation in \r\nboth the economic and social fields and take a holistic \r\napproach to addressing traditional and non-traditional \r\nsecurity threats, so as to prevent conflicts from breaking \r\nout in the first place.\r\nWe should promote open, innovative and inclusive \r\ndevelopment that benefits all. The 2008 international \r\nfinancial crisis taught us that allowing capital to blindly \r\npursue profit can only create a crisis and that global \r\nprosperity cannot be built on the shaky foundation of \r\na market without moral constraints. The growing gap \r\nbetween rich and poor is both unsustainable and unfair. \r\nIt is important for us to use both the invisible hand \r\nand the visible hand to create synergy between market \r\nforces and Government function and strive to achieve \r\nboth efficiency and fairness.\r\nDevelopment is meaningful only when it is \r\ninclusive and sustainable. Achieve this goal requires \r\nopenness, mutual assistance and win-win cooperation. \r\nIn today’s world, close to 800 million people still live \r\nin extreme poverty; nearly 6 million children die before \r\nthe age of 5 each year; and nearly 60 million children \r\nare unable to go to school. The just-concluded United \r\nNations sustainable development Summit adopted the \r\npost-2015 development Agenda (resolution 70/1). We \r\nmust translate our commitments into action and work \r\ntogether to ensure a bright future in which everyone \r\nis free from want, has access to development and lives \r\nwith dignity.\r\nWe should increase inter-civilization exchanges so \r\nas to promote harmony, inclusiveness and respect for \r\ndifferences. The world is simply more colourful as a result \r\nof its cultural diversity. Diversity breeds exchanges, \r\nexchanges create integration, and integration makes \r\nprogress possible. In their interactions, civilizations \r\nmust accept their differences. Only through mutual \r\nrespect, mutual learning and harmonious coexistence \r\ncan the world maintain its diversity and thrive. Each \r\ncivilization reflects the unique vision and contribution \r\nof its people, and no civilization is superior to any \r\nother. Different civilizations should have dialogue and \r\nexchanges instead of trying to exclude or replace one \r\nanother. The history of humankind is a process of active \r\nexchanges, interactions and integration among different \r\ncivilizations. We should respect all civilizations and \r\ntreat one another as equals. We should draw inspiration \r\nfrom one another to boost the creative development of \r\nhuman civilization.\r\nWe should build an ecosystem that puts Mother \r\nNature and green development first. Humankind may \r\nutilize nature and even try to transform it, but we are, \r\nafter all, a part of it. We should care for nature and not \r\nplace ourselves above it. We should reconcile industrial \r\ndevelopment with nature and pursue harmony between \r\nman and nature to achieve the sustainable development \r\nof the world and the all-round development of \r\nhumankind.\r\nTo build a sound ecology is vital for humankind’s \r\nfuture. All members of the international community \r\nshould work together to build a sound global \r\neco-environment. We should respect nature, follow \r\nnature’s ways and protect nature. We should firmly \r\npursue green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. China will shoulder its share of \r\nresponsibility and continue to play its part in this \r\ncommon endeavour. We also urge developed countries \r\nto fulfil their historical responsibilities, honour their \r\nemission-reduction commitments and help developing \r\ncountries mitigate and adapt to climate change.\r\nThe more than 1.3 billion Chinese people are \r\nendeavouring to realize the Chinese dream of great \r\nnational renewal. The dream of the Chinese people is \r\nclosely connected with the dreams of the other peoples \r\nof the world. We cannot realize the Chinese dream \r\nwithout a peaceful international environment, a stable \r\n15-29265 21/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\ninternational order and the understanding, support \r\nand help of the rest of the world. The realization of \r\nthe Chinese dream will bring more opportunities to \r\nother countries and contribute to global peace and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nChina will continue to participate in building world \r\npeace. We are committed to peaceful development. No \r\nmatter how the international landscape may evolve \r\nand how strong China may become, China will never \r\nseek hegemony or expansion or to establish a sphere \r\nof influence. We will continue to contribute to global \r\ndevelopment and to pursue common development and \r\nthe win-win strategy of opening up. We are ready to \r\nshare our development experience and opportunities \r\nwith other countries, and we invite other countries to \r\nboard China’s express train of development, so that all \r\nof us will achieve common development.\r\nChina will continue to uphold the international \r\norder. We will stay committed to the path of peaceful \r\ndevelopment through cooperation. China was the first \r\ncountry to put its signature on the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We will continue to uphold the international \r\norder and system, underpinned by the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter. China will continue to \r\nstand together with other developing countries. We \r\nfirmly support the greater representation and voice \r\nof developing countries, especially African countries, \r\nin the international governance system. In voting at \r\nthe United Nations, China will always side with the \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nI take this opportunity to announce China’s decision \r\nto establish a 10-year, $1 billion peace and development \r\nfund to support the work of the United Nations, advance \r\nmultilateral cooperation and promote world peace and \r\ndevelopment. I also wish to announce that China will \r\njoin the new United Nations peacekeeping capabilities \r\nreadiness system and has therefore decided to take the \r\nlead in setting up a permanent formed peacekeeping \r\npolice force and a standby peacekeeping force of 8,000 \r\ntroops. I also wish to announce that China will provide \r\na total of $100 million of free military assistance to the \r\nAfrican Union over the next five years to support the \r\nestablishment of the African Standby Force and the \r\ndevelopment of the African Capacity for Immediate \r\nResponse to Crisis.\r\nAs the United Nations enters a new decade, let us \r\nunite even more closely to forge a new partnership of \r\nwin-win cooperation and a community of shared future \r\nfor humankind. Let the vision of beating our swords \r\ninto ploughshares and building a war-free world with \r\nlasting peace take root in our hearts. Let the aspirations \r\nfor development, prosperity, fairness and justice spread \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the People’s Republic of \r\nChina for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic \r\nof China, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al \r\nHussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the King of the Hashemite Kingdom of \r\nJordan.\r\nHis Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nMajesty King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nKing Abdullah: It is an honour to stand before the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I am here representing Jordan as a \r\nGod-fearing and God-loving human being. I am here as \r\na father who wants his children, like all others, to live \r\nin a compassionate and more peaceful world.\r\nSuch a future is under serious threat from the \r\nkhawarij, the outlaws of Islam, who operate globally \r\ntoday. They target religious differences, hoping to \r\nkill cooperation and compassion among the billions \r\nof people of all faiths and communities, who live side \r\nby side in our many countries. Those outlaw gangs use \r\nsuspicion and ignorance to expand their own power. \r\nAnd worse still is the free hand they grant themselves \r\nto distort the word of God in order to justify the most \r\natrocious of crimes.\r\nAll of us here are united by our conviction that \r\nthose forces must be defeated. But before we ask how \r\nto achieve that objective, let us ask the following. What \r\nif they were not defeated? What would our world look \r\nlike? Can we tolerate a future where mass murder, \r\npublic beheadings, kidnapping and slavery are common \r\npractices? Where the persecution of communities is the \r\nlaw? Where humankind’s cultural treasures that have \r\n22/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nbeen preserved for thousands of years are systematically \r\ndestroyed?\r\nI have called this crisis a third world war, and I \r\nbelieve we must respond with equal intensity. That \r\nmeans global collective action on all fronts. But let us \r\nmake no mistake; the more important war is the one we \r\nwage on the battlegrounds of the heart, the soul and the \r\nmind. And, in this fight, all countries and all people \r\nmust come together.\r\nJordan has been proud to work with Member States \r\nand their countries to spearhead global initiatives for \r\ntolerance and dialogue. That has been reflected in the \r\nAmman Message and A Common Word, and, four years \r\nago, we helped to initiate the World Interfaith Harmony \r\nWeek, an annual United Nations event to focus all \r\npeople, especially young people, on the essentials of \r\ntolerance and coexistence. Those efforts must continue, \r\nand the United Nations has a central role. But all of us, \r\nas individuals and as leaders, must help build the road \r\nahead. Let me suggest seven essential steps.\r\nFirst, let us get back to basics and to the essence \r\nand shared spirit of our respective faiths and creeds. \r\nIt seems to me that we can sometimes lose sight of \r\nthe larger picture. What separates human beings is \r\nminuscule, compared to what we hold in common: deep \r\nvalues of love, peace, justice and compassion.\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\n“And My mercy embraces all things.” (The \r\nHoly Koran, VII:156)\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nSecondly, let us change our tone. On my travels not \r\nlong ago, I saw a roadside sign that said, “Fear God”. A \r\nfew miles down the road, was another, saying the same \r\nthing, then another and then a final one, saying, “... Or \r\nyou will go to Hell”, and I asked myself when and how \r\ndid fear and intimidation creep so insidiously into our \r\nconversations, when there is so much more to be said \r\nabout the love of God. Most people may think they have \r\nnothing to do with the hate expressed by extremists. \r\nBut our world is also threatened when violence, fear \r\nand anger dominate our discourse, whether in school \r\nlessons, weekly sermons or international affairs.\r\nThirdly, let us act upon our beliefs. And here, I \r\nmean more than praying, fasting or zakat — giving \r\nalms. I mean integrating our values into every part of \r\nour daily lives and every hour of every day. By loving \r\nour neighbour, showing respect to those different from \r\nus and being kind to our own children, each one of us \r\ncan do something to reflect the spirit of our Creator.\r\nFourthly, let us amplify the voice of moderation. It \r\nis one of the greatest ironies of our time that extremist \r\nvoices use advanced media to propagate ignorant ideas. \r\nWe must not let our screens, airwaves, broadband and \r\nsocial media be monopolized by those who pose the \r\ngreatest danger to our world. We too must populate our \r\nmedia and, more important, the minds of our young \r\npeople, with the purity and power of moderation.\r\nFifthly, let us recognize deceit. When we examine \r\nthe motives of those outlaws, the khawarij, and, indeed, \r\nthe motives of extremists on all sides, we find hunger \r\nfor power, control of people, of money and of land. \r\nThey use religion as a mask. Is there a worse crime than \r\ntwisting God’s word to promote one’s own interests? \r\nIs there a more despicable act than feeding on the \r\nvulnerable and innocent, to recruit them to one’s ranks? \r\nIn the global Muslim community — 1.7 billion good \r\nmen and women, one quarter of humankind — today’s \r\noutlaw gangs are nothing but a drop in the ocean. But \r\na drop of venom can poison a well. We must protect \r\nthe purity of our faith from worldly contamination. As \r\nMuslims, this is our fight, as it is our duty.\r\nSixthly, by all means, let us be intolerant of \r\nintolerance. Extremists rely on the apathy of moderates. \r\nBut moderation does not mean accepting those \r\nwho trample on others and rejecting all those who \r\ndiffer. Today’s global fight is not between peoples, \r\ncommunities or religions. It is between all moderates of \r\nall faiths against all extremists, in all religions. Leaders \r\nof every country, every belief and every neighbourhood \r\nneed to take a clear and public stand against intolerance \r\nof any kind. That includes respecting all places where \r\nGod is worshipped, whether mosque, church, synagogue \r\nor temple.\r\nAnd nothing can be more important and can have \r\nmore impact in framing this respect and coexistence \r\nthan Jerusalem. The Hashemite custodianship of \r\nJerusalem’s Islamic and Christian holy sites is a sacred \r\nduty, and we join Muslims and Christians everywhere \r\nin rejecting threats to the holy places and the Arab \r\ncharacter of that Holy City.\r\nLastly, there is hyperconnectivity. In our era, \r\nconnectivity defines how we live and interact in our \r\nwork, our communities, our schools and our lives. \r\nOnly a few years ago, we were introduced to the \r\nInternet of computers; now, we talk about the Internet \r\n15-29265 23/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nof things. But over them all must be the Internet of \r\nhumankind — a hyperconnection, bringing us together \r\nin collective consciousness and common cause. By \r\ngathering here today, we acknowledge that the power \r\nof working together far exceeds any individual effort. \r\nOur great General Assembly must address urgent world \r\nissues: sustainable and inclusive development that can \r\ndeliver more opportunities, especially to young people, \r\nand peaceful, political solutions to regional crises.\r\nIt is the world’s obligation to find solutions \r\nand provide relief for the millions of refugees in my \r\nregion. Today, we are still facing huge shortfalls, \r\ncuts and threats to vital United Nations programmes \r\nand agencies, including the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees and the World Food Programme.\r\nToday, we are haunted by the images of thousands \r\nof refugees on the shores and borders of Europe, \r\nseeking hope, far away from their homeland. In Jordan, \r\nwe have been faced with that challenge since the \r\nbeginning of the Syrian crisis. Today, Syrian refugees \r\nalone constitute 20 per cent of my country’s population.\r\nWe have been relieving the international community \r\nof a significant part of the burden of that humanitarian \r\ndisaster since the beginning. Support to our country \r\nhas been a small fraction of the cost we have endured. \r\nIt is high time for the international community to act \r\ncollectively in facing this unprecedented humanitarian \r\ncrisis and to provide support to countries such as Jordan \r\nand Lebanon, which have been carrying the brunt of \r\nthat burden over the past four years.\r\nIn all these areas, we must act, and act collectively, \r\nfor the future of our world. And connectivity is key. \r\nThe values we share — equality, compassion and \r\nhope — need to be connected to everything we do. And \r\nwe must keep ourselves connected to each other, for the \r\ngood of all. These bonds are the power and promise of \r\nour United Nations. Here, together, we can and must \r\ncreate the future our people need — a safer, stronger \r\nworld of coexistence, inclusion, shared prosperity and \r\npeace. Seven steps can bring us closer to our destination. \r\nGod willing, our countries and peoples will achieve \r\nthose seven steps and many more.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank His Majesty the King of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Vladimir Putin, President of the \r\nRussian Federation\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian \r\nFederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vladimir Putin, President of the \r\nRussian Federation, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Putin (spoke in Russian): The \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a good \r\nopportunity both to consider our history and to talk \r\nabout our collective future. In 1945, the countries that \r\nhad defeated Nazism united their efforts to lay firm \r\nfoundations for the post-war world order. I should point \r\nout here that the key decisions about the principles for \r\nguiding cooperation among States and the creation of \r\nthe United Nations were made in our country, at the \r\nmeeting in Yalta of the leaders of the coalition against \r\nHitler. The Yalta system emerged out of genuine travail, \r\npaid for with tens of millions of lives and the two world \r\nwars that engulfed the world in the twentieth century. \r\nAnd in all fairness to it, it has helped humankind \r\ntraverse the turbulent and sometimes dramatic events \r\nof the past seven decades and has spared the world \r\nmajor cataclysms.\r\nThe United Nations is an Organization unique in its \r\nlegitimacy, representativeness and universality. True, \r\nit has recently been much criticized for its perceived \r\ninsufficient effectiveness and for decision-making on \r\nfundamental issues that can be stymied by insuperable \r\ndifferences, particularly among members of the \r\nSecurity Council. I would like to point out, however, \r\nthat over the 70 years of the existence of the United \r\nNations there have always been disagreements, and the \r\nright to the veto has always been exercised — by the \r\nUnited States, Great Britain, France, China, the Soviet \r\nUnion and later Russia, alike. That is entirely natural \r\nfor such a diverse and representative Organization. \r\nWhen the United Nations was established, there was \r\n24/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nno suggestion that unanimity would reign. Indeed, \r\nthe essence of the Organization consists in seeking \r\nand reaching compromise. Its strength lies in taking \r\naccount of different opinions and points of view. The \r\ndecisions that are discussed in the United Nations \r\nare either adopted as resolutions or they are not. As \r\nthe diplomats say, they either go through or do not \r\ngo through. Any action on the part of any State that \r\nbypasses that procedure is illegitimate and runs counter \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations and in defiance of \r\ninternational law.\r\nWe all know that a single dominating power centre \r\nemerged in the world after the end of the Cold War. \r\nThose who found themselves at the top of that pyramid \r\nwere tempted to think that if they were so strong and \r\nexceptional, they knew better than anyone else what \r\nshould be done. As a consequence, they thought, why \r\nshould they bother with the United Nations, which \r\ninstead of automatically sanctioning and legitimizing \r\nnecessary decisions frequently just stands in the way or, \r\nas we say, gets underfoot? It has become commonplace \r\nto say that the Organization, as originally conceived, \r\nhas become obsolete and that its historical mission has \r\nbeen accomplished.\r\nThe world is changing, of course, and the United \r\nNations must keep up with that natural transformation. \r\nRussia is ready to work on that, based on a broad \r\nconsensus with all its partners, but we consider \r\nefforts to undermine the authority and legitimacy of \r\nthe United Nations to be extremely dangerous. They \r\ncould lead to the collapse of the entire architecture of \r\ninternational relations. Then we would indeed be left \r\nwith no rules beyond might is right. That would be a \r\nworld ruled by selfishness rather than collective effort; \r\na world ever more dictatorial and less about equality, \r\ngenuine democracy and freedom; a world where an \r\never-growing number of de facto protectorates and \r\nexternally controlled territories would replace truly \r\nindependent States. \r\nWhat, after all, is State sovereignty, about which \r\nsome of our colleagues have already spoken? More than \r\nanything it is about freedom — the freedom of every \r\nperson, people or State to choose their own destiny. \r\nAnd by the way, the issue of the so-called legitimacy \r\nof State power also falls into this category. We should \r\nnever play with words or manipulate them. Every term \r\nof international law and international affairs should be \r\nclear and transparent and possess uniformly understood \r\ncriteria.\r\nWe are all different, and we should respect that. \r\nNobody is obliged to conform once and for all to a \r\nsingle model of development that someone has deemed \r\nto be the only right one. We should all remember what \r\nwe have learned from past experience. For example, \r\nwe remember instances from the history of the Soviet \r\nUnion. Attempts to export social experiments and \r\nto push for change in one country or another based \r\non our own ideological positions often led to tragic \r\nconsequences and to deterioration rather than progress.\r\nIt seems, however, that no one learns from others’ \r\nmistakes. They just repeat them, and the export of \r\nrevolutions, this time so-called democratic revolutions, \r\ncontinues. We have only to look at the situation in \r\nthe Middle East and North Africa, which the speaker \r\nbefore me discussed. Certainly, the political and social \r\nproblems of the region have been brewing for a long \r\ntime, and people there naturally wanted change. \r\nBut how has it actually turned out? Instead of \r\nreforming Government institutions, aggressive foreign \r\ninterference has resulted in the abrupt destruction of the \r\nvery fabric of life. Instead of the triumph of democracy \r\nand progress we got violence, poverty and social \r\ncatastrophe. And human rights, including the right \r\nto life, are simply ignored. One cannot help wanting \r\nto ask those who created this situation if they at least \r\nrealize now what they have done. But I am afraid the \r\nquestion would go unanswered, because policies based \r\non complacency and a belief in one’s exceptionality and \r\nimpunity are never abandoned.\r\nIt is now obvious that the power vacuum that has \r\nappeared in a number of the countries of the Middle East \r\nand North Africa has led to the emergence of areas of \r\nanarchy that immediately began to fill with extremists \r\nand terrorists. Tens of thousands of militants are now \r\nfighting under the banners of the so-called Islamic \r\nState. They include former Iraqi servicemen who were \r\nthrown out into the street in the wake of the invasion \r\nof Iraq in 2003. Another supplier of recruits is Libya, \r\nwhose statehood was destroyed as a result of a gross \r\nviolation of Security Council resolution 1973 (2011). \r\nAnd now members of the so-called moderate Syrian \r\nopposition, supported by the West, are joining the \r\nradical ranks. First they arm and train them, and now \r\nthey are defecting to the so-called Islamic State. Indeed, \r\nthe Islamic State itself did not come from nowhere. It, \r\ntoo, was initially forged as a tool against undesirable \r\nsecular regimes. Having established a foothold in Syria \r\nand Iraq, the Islamic State is actively expanding into \r\n15-29265 25/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nother regions, with the aim of dominating the Islamic \r\nworld, and not just there. It is clearly not limiting itself \r\nto those plans alone.\r\nThe situation is more than dangerous. In such \r\ncircumstances, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to \r\nmake loud declarations about the threat of international \r\nterrorism while turning a blind eye to the channels \r\nthat are financing and supporting terrorists, including \r\nthrough the proceeds of drug trafficking and illicit \r\ntrading in oil and arms, or to attempt to manipulate \r\nextremist groups and make them do one’s bidding in \r\norder to achieve one’s own political goals, in the hope \r\nof dealing with them — or, to put it more simply, \r\nliquidating them — later. What I have to say to those \r\npeople is this: Sirs, while you are certainly dealing with \r\ncruel people, they are in no way stupid or primitive. \r\nThey are just as smart as you, and you cannot yet \r\ntell who is using whom for his own ends. The recent \r\ninformation on the transfer of arms to the terrorists by \r\nthat moderate opposition itself is the best proof of that.\r\nWe believe that any attempt to f lirt with terrorists, \r\nlet alone arm them, is not just short-sighted; it is \r\nincendiary. It could result in a dramatic increase \r\nin the global terrorist threat and its critical spread \r\nto new regions, especially considering the fact that \r\nmilitants from many countries, including Europe, are \r\npassing through Islamic State training camps. Nor, \r\nunfortunately, I must admit frankly to my colleagues, is \r\nRussia an exception. We cannot allow such criminals, \r\nwho have already smelled blood, to return home and \r\ncontinue their evil deeds there. We do not want that. \r\nAnd after all, would anyone want that?\r\nRussia has always been firm and consistent in \r\nopposing terrorism in all its forms. Today we are \r\nproviding military and technical assistance to Iraq, \r\nSyria and other countries of the region that are fighting \r\nterrorist groups. We think it is an enormous mistake \r\nto refuse to cooperate with the Syrian authorities and \r\nthe State armed forces, who are valiantly combating \r\nterrorism face to face. Finally, we should acknowledge \r\nthat no one except President Al-Assad’s Government \r\narmed forces and the Kurdish militia is truly fighting the \r\nIslamic State and other terrorist organizations in Syria. \r\nWe are aware of all the problems and contradictions in \r\nthe region, but we must nonetheless be realistic.\r\nI feel obliged to point out that Russia’s honest \r\nand straightforward approach has recently been used \r\nas a pretext for accusing us of harbouring increasing \r\nambitions — as if the people saying that have no \r\nambitions at all themselves. But the real issue is not \r\nRussia’s ambitions but the fact that we can no longer \r\ntolerate the current state of affairs in the world. In \r\nreality, we are proposing that we should be guided by \r\nour shared values and interests rather than ambitions. \r\nWe should unite our efforts to address, on the basis \r\nof international law, these new problems we face \r\nand create a genuinely broad international coalition \r\nagainst terrorism. Like the coalition against Hitler, it \r\ncould unite all the diverse forces willing to resolutely \r\nresist those who, like the Nazis, sow evil and hatred of \r\nhumankind.\r\nAnd, naturally, Muslim countries should play \r\na key role in that coalition. Not only is the Islamic \r\nState a direct threat to them, it also desecrates one of \r\nthe world’s greatest religions with its bloody crimes. \r\nThe militants’ ideologists make a mockery of Islam \r\nand pervert its true humanistic values. In that regard, \r\nI would also like to address Muslim spiritual leaders. \r\nTheir authority and tutelage are vital at this moment. \r\nIt is essential to prevent those whom militants try to \r\nrecruit from making hasty decisions. And those who \r\nhave been deceived and who by force of circumstance \r\nhave ended up in the terrorists’ ranks must be helped to \r\nfind a path back to normal life, lay down their arms and \r\ncease their fratricide.\r\nIn the next few days Russia, as the current President \r\nof the Security Council, will convene a ministerial-level \r\nmeeting aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis \r\nof threats in the Middle East. First, we propose to \r\ndiscuss the possibility of agreeing on a draft resolution \r\ndesigned to coordinate the actions of all the forces \r\nconfronting the Islamic State and other terrorist groups. \r\nOnce again, that coordination should be based on the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe believe that the international community can \r\ndevelop a comprehensive strategy for the political \r\nstabilization and social and economic recovery of the \r\nMiddle East. Then there would be no need to build \r\ncamps for refugees. The f lood of people forced to leave \r\ntheir homelands has literally engulfed first the country’s \r\nneighbours and now Europe. Now they number in the \r\nhundreds of thousands, but they could soon be millions. \r\nThis is a great and tragic new migration of peoples, and \r\na harsh lesson for all of us, including Europe.\r\nI would like to stress that the refugees \r\nunquestionably need our compassion and support. \r\nHowever, any fundamental solution to the problem \r\nmust involve restoring statehood where it has been \r\n26/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\ndestroyed, strengthening Government institutions \r\nwhere they still exist or are being re-established, and \r\nproviding comprehensive military, economic and \r\nmaterial assistance to countries in difficulties — and, \r\nof course, to those who have not abandoned their homes \r\ndespite all their ordeals. Naturally, any assistance to \r\nsovereign States can and must be offered rather than \r\nimposed, and only in accordance with the United \r\nNations Charter. In other words, everything being done \r\nor to be done in this area in accordance with the norms \r\nof international law must be backed by our universal \r\nOrganization, and anything contravening the Charter \r\nmust be rejected. More than anything, I believe it is \r\nvital to help restore Government institutions in Libya, \r\nsupport the new Government of Iraq and provide \r\ncomprehensive assistance to the legitimate Government \r\nof Syria.\r\nEnsuring peace and regional and global stability \r\nremains the key task of the international community, \r\nwith the United Nations at its helm. In our view, \r\nthat means creating a space of equal and indivisible \r\nsecurity that is not for the select few, but for everyone. \r\nYes, it is a complex, difficult and time-consuming \r\ntask, but there are no alternatives to it. However, for \r\nsome of our colleagues the Cold War bloc mindset \r\nand desire to assimilate new geopolitical areas are \r\nstill paramount. They began by continuing to expand \r\nNATO — and one wonders why, with the Warsaw \r\nPact bloc no longer in existence and the Soviet Union \r\nbroken up. And yet NATO is not only still there; like \r\nits military infrastructure, it is still expanding. Then \r\nthey offered post-Soviet countries a false choice — to \r\nbe either with the West or the East. Sooner or later, \r\nthat logic of confrontation was bound to turn into a \r\nserious geopolitical crisis, and that is what happened \r\nin Ukraine, where the people’s dissatisfaction with the \r\nauthorities was exploited and a military coup provoked \r\nfrom outside. A civil war erupted as a result.\r\nWe firmly believe that we can end the bloodshed \r\nand find a way out of this deadlock only through full \r\nimplementation, in good faith, of the Minsk agreements \r\nof 12 February. Ukraine’s territorial integrity cannot be \r\nensured by threats and force of arms, but it must be \r\ndone. What is needed is respect for the choice of the \r\npeople of the Donbas region, genuine consideration \r\nof their interests and rights and their engagement in \r\ndevising the key elements of the country’s political \r\nstructure, in line with the Minsk agreements that will \r\nguarantee that Ukraine can develop as a civilized State \r\nand an essential link in the construction of a common \r\narea of security and economic cooperation in both \r\nEurope and Eurasia.\r\nI have a reason for speaking of a common area for \r\neconomic cooperation. Only recently, it seemed that in \r\nthe economic sphere, where the objective laws of the \r\nmarket apply, we would learn to live without dividing \r\nlines and to act on the basis of transparent rules, jointly \r\ndevised, including the principles of the World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO), which stand for freedom of trade \r\nand investment and open competition. Today, however, \r\nunilateral sanctions that circumvent the United Nations \r\nCharter have almost become the norm. They not only \r\nserve political aims, they act as a way of pushing \r\ncompetitors out of the market.\r\nI would like to note another sign of growing economic \r\nselfishness. A number of countries have chosen to \r\ncreate closed, exclusive economic associations, with \r\nnegotiations conducted behind closed doors and in \r\nsecret, undisclosed to their own citizens and business \r\ncommunities. Nor do they inform other countries and \r\nGovernments whose interests may be affected. Perhaps \r\nthey want all of us to be left with the fait accompli that \r\nthe rules of the game have been changed in favour of a \r\nsmall group, and without the participation of the WTO. \r\nThat could completely unbalance the trade system \r\nand lead to the disintegration of the global economic \r\nenvironment. These issues affect the interests of all \r\nStates and influence the future of the entire world \r\neconomy. That is why we propose discussing them \r\nwithin the United Nations, the WTO and the Group of \r\n20.\r\nIn opposition to a policy of exclusiveness, \r\nRussia proposes harmonizing regional economic \r\nprojects through what is known as the integration of \r\nintegrations, based on the universal and transparent \r\nrules of international trade. One example is our plan \r\nto link the Eurasian Economic Union with China’s \r\ninitiative in creating a Silk Road economic belt. And \r\nwe continue to believe the possibility of harmonizing \r\nintegration processes within the Eurasian Economic \r\nUnion and the European Union to be very promising.\r\nAmong the issues affecting the future of all \r\nhumankind is the challenge of global climate change. \r\nIt is in our interests to ensure that we get results at \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change to be held in \r\nParis in December. As part of our national contribution, \r\nby 2030 we plan to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions \r\nto between 70 and 75 per cent of their 1990 levels. I \r\n15-29265 27/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nsuggest, however, that we should take a broader view of \r\nthis issue. By establishing quotas on harmful emissions \r\nor taking other steps that by their very nature are still \r\nonly tactical, we may mitigate the problem for a certain \r\namount of time, but fundamentally we will not solve it.\r\nWe need a completely different approach. We \r\nshould be focusing on introducing fundamentally \r\nnew technologies, inspired by nature, that rather than \r\ndamaging the environment will be in harmony with it \r\nand will enable us to restore the balance between the \r\nbiosphere and the technosphere that human activities \r\nhave destroyed. It is indeed a challenge on a planetary \r\nscale, but I am confident that humankind has the \r\nintellectual wherewithal to respond to it. We must \r\nunite our efforts, most of all those States possessing \r\nsolid research capacities and fundamental scientific \r\nachievements. We propose convening a special forum \r\nunder United Nations auspices for a comprehensive \r\nconsideration of the issues related to the depletion of \r\nnatural resources, the destruction of habitats and climate \r\nchange. Russia is ready to be one of the organizers of \r\nsuch a forum.\r\nMr. Balói (Mozambique), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nOn 10 January 1946, the General Assembly of the \r\nUnited Nations gathered in London to begin work on \r\nits first session. Eduardo Zuleta Ángel, a Colombian \r\ndiplomat and the Chairman of the Preparatory \r\nCommission, opened the session by giving what I \r\nbelieve was a concise definition of the basic principles \r\nby which the United Nations should be guided in its \r\nactivities. They are free will, disdain for scheming \r\nand trickery, and a spirit of cooperation. Today his \r\nwords can be a guide for us all. Russia believes in the \r\nhuge potential of the United Nations to help us avoid \r\na new global confrontation and engage in strategic \r\ncooperation. We will work consistently with other \r\ncountries to strengthen the central coordinating role \r\nof the United Nations. I am confident that together we \r\ncan make the world a stable and safe place and ensure \r\nconditions conducive to the development of every State \r\nand nation.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Russian \r\nFederation for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian \r\nFederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Park Geun-hye, President of the \r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMs. Park Geun-hye, President of the Republic of \r\nKorea, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Park Geun-hye, President \r\nof the Republic of Korea, and to invite her to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Park Geun-hye (spoke in Korean; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nI would first like to congratulate the United Nations \r\non the seventieth anniversary of its founding, and \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, former Speaker of the Danish \r\nParliament, on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session.\r\nThe United Nations, established 70 years ago \r\nafter the calamities of war, has been a beacon of hope \r\nfor people all over the world, thanks to the trust and \r\nhope engendered by the spirit of the United Nations \r\nthat made people its focus, despite the constraints \r\nof realpolitik. And despite the many challenges and \r\ncriticisms directed at it, the United Nations has made \r\ntremendous contributions to promoting the common \r\ngood of humankind. As we speak, the Blue Helmets of \r\nits peacekeeping operations, themselves a symbol of \r\npeace, are working to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights was a milestone in the history of \r\nhuman rights, while the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council and the International Criminal Court \r\nmarked conspicuous progress towards institutionalizing \r\nthe protection of human rights. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, launched in 2000, have been \r\nthe basis for the most successful poverty eradication \r\ncampaign in the history of the United Nations, lifting \r\nhundreds of millions out of extreme poverty.\r\nAnd few places in the world have seen the efforts \r\nof the United Nations make as much difference as \r\nthe Republic of Korea. This year also has special \r\nmeaning for my country, for it is one that brings both \r\nthe joy of marking the seventieth anniversary of our \r\nliberation and the anguish attendant on the arrival \r\n28/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nof the seventieth year of our division. In the past 70 \r\nyears, the Republic of Korea has risen above the \r\nordeals of partition and war and gone on to achieve \r\nindustrialization and democratization simultaneously. \r\nThe United Nations has stood with the Republic of \r\nKorea from the founding of our Government to this \r\nvery day. The values and ideals upheld by the United \r\nNations — global peace, the promotion of human rights \r\nand shared prosperity — have embodied the vision \r\nof the Republic of Korea itself. And the future that \r\nKorea envisions is aligned with the aspirations of the \r\nUnited Nations. The challenges we have overcome and \r\nthe successes we have achieved over the years are a \r\ntestament to the possibilities for success of the goal of \r\nthe United Nations for a better world.\r\nNotwithstanding these efforts of the United Nations \r\nand the international community, humankind today is \r\nconfronted with multiple simultaneous challenges in \r\nall corners of the world. Today, there is no shortage of \r\nconflicts, large and small, or of extremely violent civil \r\nwars. The surge in extremist groups that the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant represents is now a global \r\nconcern that needs to be urgently addressed. A single \r\nphoto of Aylan Kurdi captures how such instability is \r\nunleashing the greatest humanitarian refugee crisis \r\nsince the Second World War. Global climate change is \r\nthreatening the lives of even our future generations; \r\nEbola and other infectious diseases are causing \r\ncountless victims and awakening us to the importance \r\nof health security.\r\nToday, no one in our global village is free from \r\nthese global and transnational threats and challenges. \r\nAs the international order experiences these tectonic \r\nshifts, now, more than ever, is the time for the United \r\nNations to once again light up the beacon of hope and \r\nto illuminate the path to promoting international peace \r\nand security, human rights and collective prosperity \r\nthroughout the world. Above all, the international \r\ncommunity should rally around the United Nations \r\nand return to the founding spirit of the Charter of the \r\nOrganization, which, in its Preamble calls for faith “in \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person”. We must \r\nbuild a United Nations that is strong, we must carry the \r\nbanner of renewed multilateralism, and we must bear \r\nin mind that the value of human dignity is based on \r\nfreedom, human rights, justice and the rule of law.\r\nAs a nation that puts the peace and happiness \r\nof our global village at the centre of its diplomatic \r\nendeavours, we will spare no effort in supporting the \r\nUnited Nations as it addresses the challenges faced by \r\nthe international community, and we will highlight the \r\nideals of humanism and the need to live up to those \r\nideals. The drive by the United Nations to produce a new \r\npost-2015 development agenda is also anchored in this \r\npeople-centred spirit. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), adopted at the Summit \r\nfor the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nthree days ago (see A/70/PV.4), has set a historic \r\nmilestone on the road to a better world that leaves no \r\none behind.\r\nJust half a century ago, the Republic of Korea was \r\namong the poorest countries in the world. Today, it is \r\none of the world’s top 10 economies. In the course of \r\nachieving this “miracle on the Han River”, we drew \r\nimmense strength from the assistance and development \r\ncooperation of the international community. In this \r\nregard, I believe the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will be a potential stepping stone to a \r\nsecond and third miracle around the world.\r\nThe Republic of Korea, in its capacity as the \r\ncurrent President of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nwhich will be playing a key role in the implementation \r\nof the development agenda, will actively contribute to \r\nachieving the development goals. Along the way, the \r\nRepublic of Korea will proactively share its development \r\nexperiences and know-how with the international \r\ncommunity. In the meantime, we have been sharing \r\nwith the developing countries the experiences of the \r\nSaemaul Undong, which served as a springboard for \r\nmy country’s leap forward. I believe that the Saemaul \r\nUndong can maximize the utility of development \r\ncooperation with developing countries, given that it \r\nignites a sense of confidence and ownership through \r\ncompetition and incentives and lays the groundwork for \r\nself-help in communities with the engagement of the \r\nlocal people.\r\nTwo days ago, we and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development hosted a \r\nspecial high-level side event on the Saemaul Undong and \r\nagreed to work together to help eradicate poverty and \r\nbuild transformative local communities in developing \r\ncountries. We will further expand our efforts so that the \r\nSaemaul Undong can progress as a new paradigm for \r\nrural development in developing countries.\r\nAnother important driving force behind our \r\neconomic development is the human talent that has been \r\nnurtured through unsparing investment. Education \r\n15-29265 29/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nis the key element of the sustainable development \r\nagenda that helps to empower the individual and \r\nassist countries in attaining national development. We \r\nhave been actively engaging in the Global Education \r\nFirst Initiative as a champion country. We hosted the \r\nWorld Education Forum 2015 with UNESCO last \r\nMay, which culminated in the adoption of the Incheon \r\nDeclaration and set the global education goals to be \r\nachieved by 2030. Going forward, the Republic of \r\nKorea is determined to continue its efforts in the area \r\nof education. In particular, we will continue to work \r\nwith UNESCO to spread global citizenship education.\r\nNext, Korea will also play a strong role in reinforcing \r\nglobal health security. In addition to dispatching a \r\ndisaster response team to Sierra Leone to help fight \r\nEbola late last year, at the second high-level meeting of \r\nthe Global Health Security Agenda held in Seoul three \r\nweeks ago, the Republic of Korea announced that it \r\nwould contribute $100 million over the next five years \r\nto support capacity-building in developing countries. \r\nMoreover, in support of developing countries over \r\nthe next five years, it plans to pursue projects worth \r\n$200 million under the Better Life, Better Future \r\nInitiative.\r\nEven as we were achieving rapid industrialization, \r\nwe were expending a great deal of energy on ensuring the \r\nharmonious coexistence of humankind and nature. Our \r\ndesignation of 5 April as Arbor Day and the promotion \r\nof forestation has led to a twentyfold increase in the \r\nnumber of trees per hectare over the past 50 years. \r\nSince 1972, we have designated green belt zones to \r\ncurb development in the suburbs, thereby achieving \r\nharmony between the environment and development. \r\nToday, we are channelling our environmental advocacy \r\ninto joining the international community’s response to \r\nclimate change.\r\nDealing with climate change is an urgent task \r\nthat we can no longer afford to put off. It is critical \r\nthat the international community produce a concrete \r\nand meaningful outcome at the 2015 session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change this \r\nDecember. We believe that addressing climate change \r\nis not a burden, but a fresh opportunity to create future \r\ndrivers of growth through technological innovation.\r\nGuided by that belief, the Republic of Korea \r\nsubmitted a forward-looking intended nationally \r\ndetermined contribution last June. It is considering how \r\nto make the transition to a low-carbon economy and \r\nactively participating in the climate negotiations. In \r\naddition, as the host country of the Green Climate Fund \r\nSecretariat and the Global Green Growth Institute, \r\nKorea will continue to support climate action by \r\ndeveloping business models for new energy industries \r\nand sharing them with developing countries.\r\nThe recent United Nations review of peace \r\noperations, peacebuilding and women and peace and \r\nsecurity in line with a changing security environment \r\ncould not have come at a better time. As a country that \r\nexperienced a devastating war and remains scarred to \r\nthis day by partition, the Republic of Korea is acutely \r\naware of the importance of peace and is strongly \r\nsupporting the efforts of the United Nations to protect \r\npeace.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nTo date, my country has dispatched some 13,500 \r\npeacekeepers to 18 missions. Korean peacekeepers are \r\nheld in high regard for their exemplary and community-\r\nfriendly peacekeeping and reconstruction activities. \r\nFollowing consultations with the United Nations, the \r\nRepublic of Korea plans in the near future to make \r\nadditional deployments to peacekeeping missions, and \r\nwe will strengthen our substantive partnership with the \r\nAfrican Union.\r\nTo assist Syrian refugees f leeing the instability in \r\nthe Middle East, the Republic of Korea will step up its \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the relevant countries. It is \r\nalso focusing its attention on laying the groundwork \r\nfor peace in North-East Asia, a region that continues \r\nto experience persistent tensions and discord among \r\ncountries. In North-East Asia, we see a deepening of the \r\nAsia paradox phenomenon, where political and security \r\ncooperation lags behind the high degree of economic \r\ninterdependence among the countries in the region.\r\nRecently, moves that could potentially have \r\nprofound consequences for North-East Asia’s security \r\norder have led to misgivings among countries in the \r\nregion. Japan’s new defence and security legislation \r\nshould be implemented transparently and in a way that \r\nis conducive to friendly relations among the countries \r\nof the region and to regional peace and stability. \r\nReferring to North-East Asia with its continuing \r\ntensions and discord, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nonce described the lack of a regional cooperation \r\nmechanism as a “crucial missing link”. The reason that \r\nI proposed the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation \r\nInitiative was to remedy that omission and thereby \r\n30/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\ncreate a virtuous cycle of trust-building and increased \r\ncooperation.\r\nConsultations among the countries of the region \r\nare currently under way on a range of potential areas \r\nof collaboration, including nuclear security, disaster \r\nmanagement and health. The region’s cumulative \r\nexperience in those areas will help to promote global \r\npeace and cooperation. Such efforts on our part will \r\nalso help to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, \r\nwhich poses a serious threat to peace in North-East \r\nAsia and beyond. Resolving the North Korean nuclear \r\nissue should be accorded the highest priority if we are \r\nto safeguard the integrity of the international nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation regime and live up to the aspirations \r\nof humankind for a world without nuclear weapons.\r\nA nuclear deal with Iran was reached in July. The \r\ninternational community should now focus its efforts \r\non resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, which is \r\nthe last remaining non-proliferation challenge.\r\nIn recent weeks, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea once again publicly hinted at further acts of \r\nprovocation that would violate the terms of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. That would not only spoil the \r\nmood for the inter-Korean dialogue—which took so \r\nlong to create—but would also undermine the efforts \r\nof the countries participating in the Six-Party Talks \r\nto reopen denuclearization talks. The Government of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea would do \r\nwell to choose reform and openness, over additional \r\nprovocations, and to endeavour to free the people from \r\nhardship. Pushing ahead with provocations, including \r\nits nuclear development programme, will undermine \r\nthe values of world peace espoused by the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations. If the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea resolutely gives up its \r\nnuclear ambitions and chooses the path of openness \r\nand cooperation, the Republic of Korea will work with \r\nthe international community to actively support North \r\nKorea in developing its economy and improving the \r\nquality of life of its people.\r\nOver the course of the past 10 years, the United \r\nNations has made significant progress, not least in terms \r\nof protecting human rights and advancing freedom. \r\nMember States formally accepted the concept of the \r\nresponsibility to protect at the 2005 United Nations \r\nWorld Summit, and legal accountability for those \r\ninvolved in genocide was defined with the establishment \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and \r\nthe International Criminal Court. I believe that we \r\nshould further strengthen the responsibility to protect \r\nin order to prevent the humanitarian crises our world \r\ncurrently faces from deteriorating further.\r\nLast year, at this very rostrum, I stressed that \r\nsexual violence against women during armed \r\nconflict, whenever or wherever it may take place, \r\nis unquestionably a violation of human rights and \r\nhumanism. This year marks the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \r\non women and peace and security. The international \r\ncommunity should do justice to the occasion by paying \r\ngreater attention to sexual violence against women \r\nin conflict situations. The most compelling reason is \r\nthe fact that only a few of the victims of brutal sexual \r\nviolence during the Second World War are alive today. \r\nSolutions that can bring healing to the hearts of those \r\nstill living need to be devised promptly. The efforts \r\nmade by the United Nations High Commissioners of \r\nHuman Rights and Special Rapporteurs on this issue \r\nmust not be allowed to come to nothing. There will be \r\nno unlocking the future if the past is not acknowledged.\r\nWe now hope that the spirit of enduring partnership \r\nwith humankind that the United Nations embodies \r\nwill resonate far and wide so that past wounds can be \r\nhealed and a new future can unfold. One issue that has \r\nattracted great international attention in the realm of \r\nhuman rights over the past year is the human rights \r\nsituation of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThe report of the commission of inquiry on human \r\nrights in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nissued in February 2014, called for the active response \r\nof the international community to address the human \r\nrights issue in that country. In the wake of the report’s \r\nrelease, not only did the Human Rights Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopt relevant resolutions, but no \r\nless an organ than the Security Council took up the issue \r\nfor discussion. We once again call on the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to heed the concerns of the \r\ninternational community and to take steps to improve \r\nits human rights situation.\r\nLast year in the General Assembly (see A/69/PV.6), \r\nI proposed that a world ecopeace park be built as a \r\nspace in which to dream dreams of peace within the \r\ndemilitarized zone, the symbol of a divided Korean \r\npeninsula. However, the recent landmine incident in \r\nthe demilitarized zone brought home the inescapable \r\nreality that peace on the Korean peninsula can be \r\njeopardized in a single moment. Fortunately, the two \r\n15-29265 31/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nKoreas managed to reach an agreement on 25 August, \r\nfollowing high-level talks, and are now at a juncture that \r\nmay lead to a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation. \r\nThe impetus for moving this new virtuous cycle \r\nforward will come from the faithful implementation of \r\nthe 25 August accord and from the fulfilment by both \r\nKoreas of their commitment to take concrete steps for \r\nreconciliation and cooperation. We must no longer use \r\npolitical and military reasons as excuses for turning a \r\nblind eye to humanitarian issues, such as the reunion of \r\nseparated families. I hope we can again embark on the \r\npath to regaining our common identity as one nation, \r\nthrough the official dialogue and the various exchanges \r\nprovided for in the 25 August agreement.\r\nVery shortly, on 3 October, the German people will \r\nbe celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of their \r\nreunification. In 1948, the United Nations blessed the \r\nbirth of the Republic of Korea. Soon, I hope, the day will \r\ncome when the entire world celebrates the reunification \r\nof Korea. Ending the seven-decade-long history of a \r\ndivided Korean Peninsula, the last remaining vestige \r\nof the Cold War, will amount to nothing less than a \r\ncontribution to world peace.\r\nNot long ago, the Republic of Korea organized a \r\njourney by rail called the Eurasia Friendship Express, \r\nwhich passed through Russia and went all the way \r\nto Europe. Those who made the journey were deeply \r\ntouched and moved by it. However, the train was unable \r\nto go through the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea because the way was barred. I ask all those at the \r\nUnited Nations to lend us their strength in removing the \r\nbarriers to unification and to make it possible for the \r\nspirit of peace to suffuse the Korean Peninsula.\r\nA peacefully unified Korea will be a thriving \r\ndemocratic nation, free of nuclear weapons and \r\nsteadfast in upholding human rights. What is more, a \r\nunified Korean Peninsula, both as a symbol of peace \r\nin our global village and a new engine of growth, will \r\ncontribute greatly to peace and prosperity in North-\r\nEast Asia and beyond. I hope that the United Nations \r\nand all peace-loving countries will work together so \r\nthat the ideals of peace and human dignity dreamt of \r\nby the founders of the United Nations 70 years ago can \r\nalso be fulfilled through the unification of the Korean \r\nPeninsula.\r\nOn this grand journey towards a better world, \r\nmembers can rest assured that the Republic of Korea \r\nwill be a companion that the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community can count on.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Korea \r\nfor the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Park Geun-Hye, President of the Republic of \r\nKorea, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Rouhani (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I am \r\nspeaking on behalf of a great nation, which is mourning \r\nthe loss of thousands of Muslim pilgrims and hundreds \r\nof its own citizens. Old, young, men and women, who \r\nhad come together in the grand and global spiritual \r\ngathering of the hajj, unfortunately fell victim to \r\nthe incompetence and mismanagement of those in \r\ncharge. Owing to that incompetence on the part of the \r\nlatter, even the missing cannot be identified, and the \r\nexpeditious return of the bodies of the deceased to their \r\nmourning families has been prevented.\r\nThe magnitude of a calamity in which thousands \r\nof innocent people from the four corners of the world \r\nwere killed or injured is such that it cannot be dealt \r\nwith as though it were a natural disaster or a local issue. \r\nThe pain and emotional distress inflicted on millions of \r\nMuslims is too great to be repaired by material means \r\nalone. Public opinion demands that Saudi Arabian \r\nofficials promptly fulfil their international obligations \r\nand grant immediate consular access, with a view to the \r\nexpeditious identification and return of the cherished \r\nbodies and remains. Moreover, arrangements must be \r\nmade for there to be an independent and exhaustive \r\ninquiry into the causes of that disaster, which should \r\ninclude proposals for ways of preventing future \r\nrecurrences.\r\n32/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nI am speaking on behalf of a nation that, two \r\nyears ago, voted for constructive engagement with \r\nthe world, and I can now proudly announce that a new \r\nchapter has started in Iran’s relations with the world \r\ntoday. Two years ago, the people of Iran, voting in a \r\ncompetitive election, gave me a mandate to consolidate \r\npeace and constructive engagement with the world, \r\nwhile pursuing national rights, interests and security. \r\nThat national will manifested itself through a careful \r\nand clear diplomatic effort, which resulted in the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action, concluded between \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and six world Powers and \r\nthe European Union. That Plan of Action became an \r\ninternational instrument when the Security Council \r\nadopted resolution 2231 (2015). From the standpoint \r\nof international law, the instrument sets a valuable \r\nprecedent, as the two sides, rather than warring and then \r\nnegotiating peace, engaged in a process of dialogue and \r\nmutual understanding before a conflict could break out.\r\nI would like to take the opportunity to recognize the \r\nrole of all the negotiators in achieving that agreement. \r\nWe had opted for creating a new environment, while \r\nmaintaining our principles, and we succeeded in that \r\nundertaking. Where necessary, we moved forward, and, \r\nwhere necessary, we showed the courage for f lexibility. \r\nFor each point, we relied extensively on international \r\nlaw and showcased the potential of an approach based \r\non constructive dialogue.\r\nThe key to a successful dialogue is remembering \r\nthat any actor in the international system who pursues \r\nmaximum demands and fails to allow space for the \r\nother side cannot hope to speak of peace, stability and \r\ndevelopment. As in commerce and economic activity, \r\nso also in politics and international relations: the \r\ninterests of both parties have to be taken into account, \r\nand multilateralism and win-win solutions should \r\nprovide the basis of engagement.\r\nThe United Nations was established to sustain \r\nglobal peace and security after two World Wars. \r\nUnfortunately, it has to be acknowledged that, in most \r\ncases, this important international institution has not \r\nbeen successful or effective. This time, however, the \r\nUnited Nations made the right decision, notwithstanding \r\nthe fact that it earlier had adopted unfair resolutions \r\nagainst the Islamic Republic of Iran and imposed \r\nsanctions against the Iranian nation and Government, \r\nas a result of misunderstandings and, sometimes, the \r\novert hostility of some countries. But we believe that, \r\nas an old Iranian saying goes, the sooner the harm \r\nstops, the more benefit you will reap. Today is when \r\nthat harm stopped.\r\nResolution 2231 (2015), despite several significant \r\nshortcomings, is an important development. It is the \r\nbasis for terminating sanctions and no longer adopting \r\nresolutions hostile to Iran. We consider the past conduct \r\nof the Security Council to be unfair and stress that \r\nIran, owing to the important fatwa of its leader and \r\nits defence doctrine, has never harboured the intention \r\nof producing a nuclear weapon. Therefore, resolutions \r\nimposing sanctions against Iran were unjust and illegal. \r\nThe sanctions imposed by the Security Council and the \r\nunilateral sanctions imposed by some countries were \r\nbased on deluded and baseless allegations and created \r\ndifficult conditions for our people. But those sanctions \r\nnever in any way affected the policy that we adopted \r\nand the approach that we took towards negotiations.\r\nWe proved in those negotiations that there is \r\nnothing on Iran’s agenda other than logic, reason, ethics, \r\nand — where necessary — legitimate and resolute self-\r\ndefence against any kind of aggression. Consequently, \r\nthe United States of America ultimately had no option \r\nbut to choose negotiations and discussion over pressure \r\nand sanctions. Our seven countries and the European \r\nUnion expended considerable time and diplomatic \r\ncapital in those negotiations and should therefore \r\nexert their utmost efforts to protect and implement the \r\nagreement. We deem the compliance of all parties with \r\ntheir commitments to be the fundamental factor in the \r\nsuccess of the implementation process of the negotiated \r\nagreement.\r\nParallel to the implementation of the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action, we also expect \r\nthe nuclear-weapon States to take the necessary \r\nsteps to fulfil their commitment to full nuclear \r\ndisarmament, based on article VI of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. Furthermore, \r\nwe expect them to play a positive role in the creation of \r\na nuclear-weapon-free Middle East and not to allow the \r\nZionist regime to remain an impediment to achieving \r\nthat important objective.\r\nThe recently concluded nuclear deal, which is a \r\nbrilliant example of “victory over war”, has managed \r\nto disperse the clouds of hostility and far-reaching \r\ntensions in the Middle East — and even perhaps the \r\nspectre of another war. The deal can and should herald \r\na new era and lead to positive outcomes with regard \r\nto the establishment of sustainable peace and stability \r\nin the region. From our point of view, the agreed deal \r\n15-29265 33/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nis not the final objective but a development that can \r\nand should be the basis for further arrangements to \r\ncome. Considering the fact that the deal has created \r\nan objective basis for implementation and has set an \r\nappropriate model, it can serve as the grounds for \r\nfoundational change in the region.\r\nOur policy is to continue to make peace-seeking \r\nefforts in the region, based on the same win-win \r\nprinciple, and to act in ways that would enable the \r\nregion — and the world — to benefit from the new \r\nconditions. We will take this opportunity to look to \r\nthe future and stop focusing on the past and rebuild \r\nour relationships with the countries in the region, \r\nparticularly our neighbours, on the basis of mutual \r\nrespect and our common and collective interests.\r\nUnfortunately, the Middle East and North Africa \r\nhave turned into one of the world’s most turbulent \r\nregions. With the continuation and intensification \r\nof current conditions, the turmoil could spread to \r\nother parts of the world. In today’s interconnected \r\nand borderless world, countries and regions are \r\nencountering great difficulty in protecting their borders \r\nand preventing the spread of insecurity and instability.\r\nThe gravest and most important threat to the \r\nworld today is the possibility of terrorist organizations \r\nbecoming terrorist States. We would consider it \r\nunfortunate for national uprisings in our region to be \r\nhijacked by terrorists and for the destiny of nations to \r\nbe determined by arms and terror rather than by the \r\nballot box. We propose that the fight against terrorism \r\nbe incorporated into a binding international instrument \r\nand that no country be allowed to use terrorism for the \r\npurposes of interfering in the affairs of other countries. \r\nWe are prepared to assist in the eradication of terrorism, \r\nin paving the way for democracy and in ensuring that \r\narms do not dictate the course of events in the region.\r\nAs we assisted in the establishment of democracy \r\nin Iraq and Afghanistan, we are prepared to help bring \r\nabout democracy in Syria and Yemen. We support the \r\nconsolidation of power through elections, rather than \r\nthrough arms. We defend the rule of the majority that \r\nrespects the rights of minorities.\r\nToday, while safeguarding its historic and cultural \r\nheritage, Iran is looking to the future — not only the \r\ndistant future but also the near future, with a bright \r\noutlook for cooperation and coexistence. I say to all \r\nnations and Governments that we will not forget the \r\npast, but we do not wish to live in the past. We will \r\nnot forget war and sanctions but we look to peace and \r\ndevelopment. Through the Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action, we were not just seeking a nuclear deal. \r\nWe wanted to suggest a new and constructive way of \r\nrecreating the international order, an order based on \r\nmutual respect, non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof others and sustained cooperation and coexistence \r\namong the States Members of the United Nations.\r\nTo build a peaceful future, we must learn our \r\nlessons from the bitter past. We know that the only way \r\nto bring about lasting peace is through development. \r\nPeace without development can only be a time out \r\nduring which resentment and suspicion build. However, \r\npeace with development makes it possible for anger and \r\nresentment to dissipate and be replaced by hope and \r\nrespect for others. We have repeatedly said that the \r\nonly way to uproot terrorism in the Middle East is by \r\ntargeting its underlying social, economic and cultural \r\ncauses. Economic interactions can bring about lasting \r\nsecurity and transform the region into a haven of peace \r\nand development.\r\nAfter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Iran \r\nstands ready to show that the practical path to security \r\nand stability is through the development that comes \r\nwith economic engagement. With all of its economic \r\nand cultural potential, Iran is well-positioned to become \r\na hub for export-oriented investment. Iran is also eager \r\nto show that we can all choose a lasting peace based on \r\ndevelopment and shared interests, which will lead to \r\nsustainable security rather than a volatile peace based \r\non threats.\r\nWe hope to engage with our neighbours in a \r\nwide range of social and economic initiatives aimed \r\nat cooperation, which will enable the achievement \r\nof political understanding and even foster structural \r\ncooperation on security. In the international system \r\ntoday, mutual economic ties are considered to be the \r\nforemost factors in facilitating political cooperation \r\nand reducing security-related challenges.\r\nIn 2013, from this very stage, I called for \r\ncombating violence and extremism (A/68/PV.6, p. 13). \r\nSubsequently, the representatives of the international \r\ncommunity unanimously gave my appeal their seal of \r\nendorsement and, as a result, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 68/127, on a world against violent \r\nextremism. The implementation of that resolution \r\nrequires well-intentioned solutions and the application \r\nof experience gained in the realm of diplomacy. I \r\nam pleased that, by adding the support for the Joint \r\n34/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nComprehensive Plan of Action to the invaluable support \r\nfor the world against violent extremism resolution, we \r\nmay now devise a plan to resolve the problems of a \r\nshattered Middle East caught in the claws of brutality \r\nand savagery.\r\nWith a view to fighting ignorance, dictatorship, \r\npoverty, corruption, terrorism, violence and their social, \r\npolitical, cultural, economic and security impacts, I \r\nwould like to invite the entire world, in particular the \r\ncountries of my region, to form a Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action campaign aimed at creating a united \r\nfront against extremism and violence. Such a front \r\nmust create a collective and global movement to \r\ntackle regional problems in a serious manner through \r\ndialogue, prevent the slaughter of innocent people and \r\nthe bombardment of civilians, counter the promotion \r\nof violence and the killing of other human beings, \r\nprovide for stability in cooperation with established \r\ncentral Governments to maintain stability, and once \r\nstability is established, build diplomacy and democratic \r\ngovernance in the Middle East region.\r\nIraq, Syria and Yemen are all examples of crises \r\nthat are being stoked through terror, extremism, \r\nviolence, bloodshed, invasion and the indifference of \r\nthe international community. They are also examples \r\nof how the f light from the horrors of war and \r\nbombardment triggers displacement and homelessness. \r\nThe problems of those countries have persisted because \r\nthe international community has failed them and \r\nbecause of the wrong-minded actions of newcomers to \r\nthe region and naive transregional actors. As a result, \r\nthe wave of destruction has gone beyond the Arab world \r\nand reached the doorstep of Europe and the United \r\nStates, resulting in the loss of priceless elements of \r\nthe world heritage, including precious relics of ancient \r\ncivilizations. It has also resulted, more broadly, in the \r\ndeath of humanity itself.\r\nWe must not forget that the roots of today’s wars, \r\ndestruction and terror can be found in yesterday’s \r\noccupations, invasions and military interventions. If \r\nthe United States military invasion of Afghanistan and \r\nIraq had not taken place and if the United States had \r\nnot provided unwarranted support for the inhumane \r\nactions of the Zionist regime against the oppressed \r\nnation of Palestine, the terrorists today would not have \r\nany justification for their crimes. It is high time that \r\nthe Government of the United States stop claiming to \r\nknow the truth about our region and cease throwing \r\nbaseless accusations about against its adversaries while \r\npursuing dangerous policies on behalf of its regional \r\nallies. Its behaviour, which only cultivates the seeds of \r\ndivision and extremism, must be brought to an end, and \r\nits actions must be made compatible with the realities \r\nof the region. \r\nDespite the many problems in our region today, \r\nwe believe in a promising future. We do not doubt that \r\nthe obstacles can be overcome by wisdom, prudence \r\nand the use of new and powerful capacities, as well as \r\nby relying on our civilizational roots and our serious \r\nresolve. Thanks to the light of divine revelation, we \r\nhave faith in the bright future of humankind, in which \r\npeople will live in peace, tranquillity and spirituality. \r\nWe believe in the will of nations to choose the path of \r\ngoodness and purity. We believe that ultimate victory \r\nwill be won by those with good-natured piety.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin \r\nHamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Amir of the State of Qatar.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nHighness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir \r\nof the State of Qatar, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nSheikh Al-Thani (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to extend my congratulations to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession and to wish him every success. I also wish to \r\nexpress our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session, for his efforts in conducting the \r\nAssembly’s business at that session. I wish also to avail \r\nmyself of this occasion to commend the efforts made \r\nby His Excellency the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, to achieve the goals of the United Nations.\r\n15-29265 35/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nIt is gratifying that the United Nations has \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), which we have supported, based \r\non our belief that the good distribution of the fruits \r\nof development is a prerequisite for realizing social \r\njustice, preserving human dignity and enhancing the \r\ncohesion of communities, thereby enhancing security \r\nand stability in the world. Since there is no lasting \r\nstability without development and social justice, \r\ndevelopment is also clearly impossible where there is \r\nwar and unrest. It was our hope that this session would \r\nbe convened after some progress had been made with \r\nregard to the various bloody conflicts in our world, yet \r\nwe find ourselves encountering increasing numbers of \r\nchallenges and crises that threaten international peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe absence of international consensus has proved \r\nonce again to be an obstacle to efforts to resolve \r\nimportant issues. Selectivity in choosing what efforts \r\nto make in enforcing justice and international law \r\nremains prevalent in dealing with regional issues. That \r\ncompromises the concept of international legitimacy \r\nand the values, norms and principles that are rooted \r\nin the human conscience and have been adopted by \r\nthe international community after millions of people \r\npaid an exorbitant price throughout history as a result \r\nof major humanitarian challenges that have taken an \r\nunforgettable toll on people, such as enslavement, \r\ngenocide, colonialism, racism and world war. It is \r\nimpermissible to tamper with the values that have \r\ngrown out of the suffering of people. In a way, that is \r\nthe raison d’être of the Organization, without which our \r\nannual meetings would be meaningless.\r\nThe conflict in the Middle East will continue to \r\npose a permanent threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity, given its direct impact on the numerous crises \r\nfacing the region and the world. A just and lasting \r\nsolution to the question of Palestine, which remains \r\nan issue involving a people perennially displaced from \r\ntheir land and still under the yoke of occupation, cannot \r\nbe postponed to another generation. The achievement \r\nof a just and lasting settlement that brings an end to \r\nthe Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and \r\nwhich establishes a Palestinian State requires an Israeli \r\npartner for peace. For the time being, there is no Israeli \r\npartner for a just peace or even for a settlement. In such \r\ncircumstances, the international obligation to address \r\nthe last de facto colonial issue in modern history cannot \r\nbe shirked.\r\nUntil an end is put to occupation and procrastination \r\nand other delaying tactics, futile contacts and statements \r\nwill continue. The feverish pace of settlement activity, \r\ndespite its having been condemned, will continue, in \r\naddition to persistent violations of the sanctity of the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque. This is a clear indication not only of \r\nthe absence of Israel’s will to achieve peace, but also \r\nof the domination of ultra-Orthodox fundamentalist \r\nnationalist elements over Israeli policy. Look at what \r\nis happening in Jerusalem. Extremist religious political \r\nforces rely on literal interpretations of texts dating back \r\nthousands of years in order to desecrate other people’s \r\nholy sites and occupy and settle their land. Is this \r\nnot tantamount to religious fundamentalism? Is this \r\nviolence not an act of terrorism carried out by radical \r\nreligious forces?\r\nPermit me to address a message to all major actors \r\nof the international community: the continued failure \r\nto find a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian \r\nquestion is a blot on the conscience of humankind. \r\nThe international community is failing to find even \r\na less than fair settlement; it has not even succeeded \r\nin achieving the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip \r\nin the aftermath of the aggression, even though an \r\ninternational conference based on a Norwegian initiative \r\nwas convened specifically for this purpose. Qatar has \r\npledged to pay $1 billion for the reconstruction process, \r\nand we are continuing to provide aid to the Gaza Strip \r\nin implementation of our commitment. But we wonder \r\nwhat happened to the conference and the decisions it \r\ntook.\r\nThe international community, represented in \r\nthe Security Council, is duty-bound to assume its \r\nresponsibilities by taking a firm stance that would \r\nforce Israel to comply with the deliverables of peace, \r\nnamely, to halt all forms of settlement activity in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories; to lift the unjust siege \r\nof the Gaza Strip; and to implement the resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy that recognize the Palestinian \r\npeople’s right to regain their legitimate national rights \r\nand establish an independent Palestinian State on \r\nthe basis of the 1967 borders, in conformity with the \r\nprinciple of the two-State solution.\r\nWe caution against missed opportunities, because \r\nif people were to reach the conclusion that there is \r\nno peaceful solution to this issue, this would lead to \r\nunpredictable and dire consequences for the region and \r\nfor the whole world.\r\n36/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nThe Syrian crisis, with all of its dimensions and \r\nrepercussions, is having catastrophic consequences for \r\nthe Middle East region and the world as a whole. The \r\ncontinued atrocities and horrendous crimes perpetrated \r\nby the regime against the Syrian people threaten the \r\nstatus of the State and its people and create a breeding \r\nground for extremism and terrorism, under false \r\nreligious, sectarian and ethnic pretexts, endangering \r\nhumankind and the cultural heritage in Syria and the \r\nregion.\r\nIn that context, the Syrian regime has manipulated \r\nthe concept of terrorism by depicting peaceful \r\ndemonstrations as terrorism, even as it has been \r\ncommitting actual acts of terrorism. When the shelling \r\nand killing of civilians drove people to take armed \r\naction, and when certain entities that are not committed \r\nto the demands and principles of the Syrian revolution \r\nentered into the sphere of political action without \r\npermission, Syria became a war zone. At that point, the \r\nregime attempted to instil fear into the international \r\ncommunity as to the alternative.\r\nIt was incumbent on the international community \r\nto put an end to the massacres in a timely manner and \r\ncreate the conditions necessary for the Syrian people to \r\ndevise a rational, civil and fair alternative to despotic \r\nrule. But is there a tyranny in the world that could \r\nacknowledge an alternative? Is it possible that a tyranny \r\ncould allow an alternative to grow and develop under its \r\nshadow?\r\nWhen a people suffer from war, genocide and \r\ndisplacement, the worst decision is not to take a \r\ndecision at all, and the worst danger lies in ignoring \r\ndanger. The failure of the international community to \r\ntake the decisions and measures necessary to end this \r\ndisaster is a major crime. It reveals the failure and the \r\nincapacity of the international system and has led to \r\na loss of confidence in legality and the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nIn this context, the role of the General Assembly \r\nmust be promoted and strengthened as a broader \r\nframework for dealing with the issues facing peoples, \r\ngiven the inability or failure of the Security Council to \r\nfind fair solutions thereto.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I call for cooperation aimed at \r\nimposing a political solution in Syria that would end \r\nthe reign of tyranny and replace it with a pluralistic \r\nregime based on equal citizenship for all Syrians; defeat \r\nradicalism and terrorism and insulate Syria therefrom; \r\nrepatriate the displaced to their homes; and allow for \r\nthe reconstruction of Syria. The question is not whether \r\nthis is possible; it will be possible if certain States have \r\nthe necessary will.\r\nThe question is: is the continuation of the current \r\nsituation in Syria possible? The conflict has morphed \r\ninto genocide and caused the mass displacement of the \r\npopulation. This is having grave consequences for the \r\nregion and the entire world, even for countries that are \r\nnot working to expedite a solution because they are \r\nneither directly affected by the conflict nor reached by \r\nthe influx of displaced people.\r\nThe handling at the international level of \r\nnuclear-disarmament issues, which is characterized \r\nby shortcomings and double standards, alarms us. \r\nClear evidence of this is the recent failure of the \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to render the \r\nMiddle East a nuclear-free zone; this was disappointing \r\nand has undermined the credibility of the Treaty.\r\nThe agreement between Iran and the P5+1 is a \r\npositive and important step. We hope that this nuclear \r\nagreement will contribute to the maintenance of \r\nsecurity and stability in our region. We further wish to \r\nsee the entire region rendered free of nuclear arms and \r\nweapons of mass destruction.\r\nIn this context, given the strategic importance of \r\nthe Gulf region, the achievement of stability in the \r\nGulf is essential to the countries of the region and the \r\ninternational community as a whole. In this regard, \r\nwe emphasize our firm position that the Gulf region \r\nmust be spared any dangers or threats related to nuclear \r\nweapons, and that there must be a recognition of the \r\nright of the countries of the region to use nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes, in accordance with the relevant \r\ninternational norms.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish to reiterate that Iran is an \r\nimportant neighbouring country and that cooperation \r\nbetween it and other countries is in the interest of the \r\nregion.\r\nBilateral relations between Qatar and Iran are \r\ndeveloping and evolving steadily on the basis of \r\ncommon interests and good-neighbourliness. There is \r\nno dispute concerning bilateral relations between our \r\ntwo countries. There are various creeds and religions in \r\nour region, but, in my opinion, there is no Shiite-Sunni \r\nconflict, only differences that are triggered by the \r\npolitical interests of countries or the interests of \r\n15-29265 37/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\npolitical and social forces that foment internal sectarian \r\nprejudices.\r\nI believe that existing disputes are political, regional \r\nArab-Iranian differences rather than Sunni-Shiite \r\ndisputes. These could be resolved through dialogue \r\nand by initially agreeing on the rules governing the \r\nrelationship between Iran and the Gulf States on the \r\nbasis of the principle of non-interference in internal \r\naffairs. It is high time that a meaningful dialogue of this \r\nkind be conducted between countries that will always \r\nremain neighbours and are not in need of mediation \r\nfrom anyone. We are ready to host such a dialogue in \r\nQatar.\r\nWe affirm our commitment to Yemen’s unity, \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty, and we support \r\nthe legitimacy of the political process and urge its \r\ncompletion in accordance with the Gulf initiative and \r\nits executive mechanism, the outcome of the Yemen \r\nNational Dialogue Conference in January 2014, the \r\nRiyadh Declaration of May 2015 and the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, particularly resolution \r\n2216 (2015). It is unreasonable to set the precedent \r\nwhereby a major political party accepts the outcome \r\nof a national dialogue yet ignores it, seeking instead \r\nto impose its own vision and to dominate the entire \r\ncountry by force.\r\nWith respect to Iraqi, the stability of Iraq \r\nrequires a general national consensus free from \r\noutside interferences and from sectarian and ethnic \r\ndiscrimination. We hope that the Iraqi Government will \r\nbe able to fulfil the need for concord and reconciliation \r\namong the various Iraqi people’s factions. Experience \r\nin Iraq and Yemen has proved that the existence of \r\nmilitias operating outside the framework of legitimacy \r\nis not only a threat to the State by virtue of its inherent \r\nnature and its exclusive right to establish armed forces, \r\nbut is also tantamount to a dormant civil war that could \r\nturn into full-blown domestic strife sooner or later. Any \r\npolitical solution in Iraq, Yemen, Syria or Libya must \r\npreclude the existence of militias outside the framework \r\nof legitimate State institutions. That is a key component \r\nof any genuine settlement, without which there can be \r\nneither a permanent settlement nor real solutions.\r\nThe political forces in our region must pay heed to \r\nthe thousands of young people who recently took to the \r\nstreets in more than one Arab country demanding that \r\ncitizenship be the basis for partnership, and refusing \r\nto be represented on a sectarian basis and to accept \r\nthat sectarian representation may be used to cover up \r\ncorruption. Nations and peoples face grave political, \r\nsecurity and economic challenges from terrorism and \r\nits dire consequences. Tensions and conflicts have \r\nundoubtedly contributed to the emergence of terrorist \r\norganizations. The international community’s failure \r\nto address hotbeds of tension and conflict has also \r\ncontributed to creating an environment that is friendly \r\nto terrorist operations.\r\nTerrorism is rooted in radical ideas that brook \r\nno compromise with the actuality of people and their \r\npotential; it thrives in an atmosphere of despair and \r\nblocked prospects. Terrorism does not emerge in a \r\nsociety where policies guarantee its citizens a life \r\nof dignity and freedom. It arises in the shadow of \r\ntyranny and feeds on oppression and humiliation, feeds \r\non grudges and hatred born of torture in prison, and \r\nexploits the loss of hope of peaceful political action.\r\nMoreover, the behaviour of influential Powers in the \r\ninternational community distorts people’s perceptions \r\nrather than helping to provide clarifications. Some \r\narmed militias that commit crimes against civilians \r\nand public institutions are branded as terrorist, while \r\nothers perpetrating violence and intimidation against \r\ncivilians are not deemed terrorists due to considerations \r\nrelated not to the local communities themselves, but \r\nto international and regional Powers or to transitional \r\nalliances.\r\nThe rising toll of victims of terrorist operations \r\nhas necessitated the use of military force to counter \r\nthis phenomenon. We affirm our commitment to \r\nfighting terrorism, but even if the harshest conditions \r\nwe should not ignore its underlying causes; if we do, \r\nthe phenomenon will be exacerbated and spread even \r\nfurther. We highlight the fact that there is no faith that \r\npreaches terrorism. All religious texts contain ample \r\nteachings calling for peace, tolerance and coexistence, \r\nbut  the promoters and hucksters of literal readings of \r\nscripture ignore the fundamental religious teachings of \r\nnoble values, tolerance, cooperation and constructive \r\ndialogue for the benefit of humankind. Simple people \r\nwith their quintessential religiosity deem religion first \r\nand foremost to be a set of values and morals. That is \r\nwhat we must build on.\r\nThe State of Qatar has sought to pursue a progressive \r\npolicy in the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights and pursues cooperation with international \r\norganizations through our membership in the Human \r\nRights Council in order to consolidate the concepts and \r\nculture of human rights through an approach based on \r\n38/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nthe rule of law, transparency, justice and human dignity. \r\nWe must work together to strengthen the collective \r\nsecurity system in order to effectively deal with \r\ninternational and regional problems and to preserve \r\nthe rights of peoples. We must resolutely counter any \r\nattempt to impose temporary solutions to address the \r\nside-effects of problems rather than targeting their \r\nroots.\r\nMr. Balói (Mozambique), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nFinally, the State of Qatar will spare no effort to \r\nsupport the international community’s efforts to achieve \r\nthe goals that we all aspire to, commensurate with the \r\ninterest of our peoples and the good of humanity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Amir of the State of Qatar for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. François Hollande, President of the \r\nFrench Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the French Republic.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. François Hollande, \r\nPresident of the French Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Hollande (spoke in French): Our \r\nOrganization, the United Nations, is celebrating its \r\nseventieth anniversary. Immense progress has been \r\nmade since it was established as an institution entrusted \r\nwith the task of maintaining peace, which it has \r\nmanaged to do so on many an occasion. Yet, 70 years \r\nlater dramas and tragedies, conflicts and wars continue \r\nto unfold, and the world must yet once again rise up \r\nto significant challenges. Among those of today is the \r\nf light of hundreds of thousands — even millions — of \r\nrefugees from the Middle East and Africa, seeking \r\nprotection or simply to save their lives. Terrorism strikes \r\nat civilian populations and no country is immune from \r\nthis scourge. There are also conflicts, such as that in \r\nthe Middle East, that have remain unresolved for years \r\nand years, and that we all know could intensify at any \r\nmoment. \r\nIn the meantime, there are disasters: tsunamis, \r\nearthquakes, islands on the verge of disappearing, \r\ncoastlines washed away, and glaciers melting. That is \r\nthe reality of climate change. \r\nFaced with such challenges, we must all must \r\nshoulder our responsibilities at our respective levels. \r\nFrance, in many domains, has never refused its \r\ncooperation. France wished to host the Climate Change \r\nConference, no doubt because we were aware of that \r\nterrible failure at Copenhagen and felt that this time we \r\nneeded to make a good decision, one that can be taken \r\nonly by the entire international community.\r\nSo in Paris, we must ask ourselves one question: is \r\nhumankind capable of taking the decision to preserve \r\nlife on the planet? Yes, that single question places us at \r\na level that no one could ever imagine in our generation. \r\nSome will say, “But that can happen later, maybe at \r\nanother conference”. I assure the Assembly here and I \r\nwill say it quite plainly: if it does not happen in Paris, it \r\nwill be too late for the world.\r\nMatters have progressed well in recent months, and \r\nvery strong declarations have been made by precisely \r\nthose most responsible for global warming — the United \r\nStates and China, which have made commitments that \r\ncontribute to changing the current situation. Many calls \r\nhave come from all continents, stressing the gravity \r\nand urgency of the situation and providing detailed \r\ntestimony on what global warming is now, today. There \r\nare some countries that so far have been reluctant — here \r\nI am thinking of developing countries — and have \r\nasked themselves whether it is really useful to impose \r\nrestrictions on themselves when the most developed \r\ncountries have been free of such rules and obligations. \r\nIf asked today for a prognosis, and I often am, I will \r\nsay that nothing has been settled in regard to winning \r\nan accord in Paris — nothing. But at the same time, \r\neverything remains possible. I see three conditions \r\nthat must be met for us to be able to say that the Paris \r\nConference was truly successful, worthy of us and of \r\nwhat was entrusted to us when we were asked to host \r\nthe Conference.\r\nThe first condition is to be able to conclude a \r\nuniversal agreement applicable to all, one that is \r\nbinding and differentiated so that everyone can do their \r\nown part, and not more. To date, 90 countries — half \r\n15-29265 39/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nof those sitting in the United Nations — have submitted \r\ntheir national contribution, which represents 80 per cent \r\nof greenhouse gas emissions — already a considerable \r\nfigure. That means that half of the world has not yet \r\nresponded. I therefore invite them to do so and to do so \r\nquickly so that we can determine as of now what, given \r\nthe contributions from every State, we can assure the \r\nworld will be the limit on global warming.\r\nThe second condition that will signify our success \r\nor failure is to be able to ensure that our resolution, \r\nour action, is long-lasting. The Paris accord must not \r\nbe an end or a conclusion, but rather a starting point, \r\nthe beginning of a process. Through incorporating a \r\nreview mechanism into the agreement, we will be able \r\nto regularly review, periodically measure and even \r\nrevise every five years our national contributions. \r\nThat is what will allow us to be sure that at the end of \r\nthe century, well beyond our time, the planet will not \r\nhavewarmed by more than 2°C.\r\nThe third condition that will determine failure \r\nor success is developed countries making financial \r\ncommitments. I am aware that already in Copenhagen \r\nthe figure of $100 billion was announced to ensure \r\nthe financing of energy transition, adaptation and \r\ntechnology transfer. We must collect $100 billion by \r\n2020, but it must be said today so as to ensure that \r\nemerging countries, developing countries, can feel \r\nconfident that they will be aided and supported so that \r\nthis technological leap, the sharing of technology, will \r\ncome about. \r\nYes, one hundred billion dollars. The Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) \r\nis responsible for providing an initial estimate, to be \r\npresented at the Lima meeting. I wish here to thank the \r\nPresident of Peru for continuing the work he undertook at \r\nthe twentieth session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. The OECD will provide the initial estimate, \r\nas we have not reached $100 billion yet. So we have \r\ntwo months before the Paris Conference to continue to \r\nmobilize the World Bank, major development banks, \r\nfinancial institutions, States and private stakeholders \r\nso that we can reach $100 billion. Everyone should set \r\nan example. France abides by the rule that when serving \r\nas the host country; we must perform better than our \r\nguests, or at least as well as them.  \r\nI am announcing here today that France’s annual \r\nclimate funding, which is €3 billion today, will be \r\nmore than €5 billion in 2020. That increase in aid will \r\nnot be merely through loans, but also in the form of \r\ngrants, because it is with grants — funds transferred \r\ndirectly and that will not be reimbursed — that we \r\ncan powerfully promote the adaptation of developing \r\ncountries to the effects of climate change. \r\nIn brief, if we are in a position to meet those \r\nthree requirements — that is, a universal agreement, \r\none that can be revised and will be revised every 5 \r\nyears, and funding sufficient to cover everything that \r\nwe will have to cover in emerging needs and future \r\ntechnology — then in Paris in two months we will be \r\nable to say we have risen to the challenge; not just a \r\nrendez-vous with history, but with the future.\r\nIt is good that the international community is able to \r\nlook to the future and to say what sort of world we want. \r\nWe did it with respect to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, and we must do it for climate issues. But what \r\nis expected of the United Nations is not simply to \r\nensure — though this is already considerable — that the \r\nworld will be liveable at the end of the century, but that \r\nit is liveable today, when conflicts and wars confront \r\nus with tragedies that in 1945, when the United Nations \r\nsystem was founded, nobody imagined we would ever \r\nsee again.\r\nToday, it is Syria that once again calls on us to \r\nmobilize and to intervene, as many speakers have \r\nalready stated. Everyone considers that this is a tragedy \r\nstriking the Syrian population. Everyone has said that \r\nwe must find a solution. Let us look for it together. But \r\nfirst, we should assess what has not been done. \r\nThree years ago, when I stood at this rostrum to \r\naddress the General Assembly (see A/67/PV.6), there \r\nhad already been 30,000 victims of the Syrian tragedy. \r\nThere are now 250,000, and 12,000 children have \r\ndied, victims of the Bashar Al-Assad regime. The \r\nSyrian tragedy began with a revolution led by those \r\nwho wanted to challenge the dictatorship of Bashar \r\nAl-Assad. At that time, there were no terrorists, there \r\nwere no fundamentalist groups — there was a dictator \r\nwho was massacring a people. And the refugees whom \r\nwe are discussing today, the refugees in the camps, the \r\ndisplaced, 8 million of them — this mass of women, \r\nmen and children — have not just f led a war. For more \r\nthan three years they have been f leeing from the regime \r\nof Bashar Al-Assad. And still today that same regime is \r\nraining bombs on innocent civilians.\r\nBut it is not because there is a terrorist group that \r\nitself massacres, kills, rapes, destroys — including \r\n40/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\ndestruction of the common heritage of humankind — that \r\nsome form of pardon, of amnesty, should necessarily be \r\naccorded to the regime that created this situation, as if \r\nthe existence of a terrorist group that commits the worst \r\nkinds of evil acts could furnish the regime with a way \r\nto share in what is good. No, all those women, men and \r\nchildren are victims of this tragedy, which is generated \r\nby the alliance between terrorism and dictatorship. No \r\nsolution can be found outside of a political process. \r\nFrance, which, due to its history and also its \r\nlinks that bind it to that part of the world, intends to \r\nshoulder its responsibilities. It has already done so \r\nrecently, including through armed action, through \r\nforce. France wants to work with everyone; it does not \r\nexclude any country — neighbouring countries, which \r\nare most affected, the Gulf countries, but also Iran, the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, as well \r\nas Europeans. We want to work with everyone, with \r\neveryone who wants to work with us.\r\nThere is talk of a coalition. This broad coalition \r\nis possible; it is even desirable and necessary in order \r\nto put an end to what is happening in Syria. But this \r\ncoalition must have a clear basis or it will never see \r\nthe light of day. The basis was provided in Geneva \r\nmore than three years ago. And what did the Geneva \r\nagreement say? It specified a transitional Government \r\nwith full powers, including members of the present \r\nGovernment and the opposition, formed on the basis of \r\nmutual consent. That is the basis; let us use it to move \r\nforward. \r\nBut I can see, in the context of this ongoing \r\nadversity, that some are making every diplomatic effort \r\nto incorporate Bashar Al-Assad in that process. But \r\none cannot make the victims and the executioner work \r\ntogether. Al-Assad is at the origin of the problem; he \r\ncannot be part of the solution. We have to put an end to \r\nthe suffering of the Syrian people, but we must also look \r\nbeyond the political transition that has to be sought, the \r\nbroad coalition that has to be formed, this condition \r\nthat has to be laid down, to a new Government capable \r\nof uniting all those who have fought, but without the \r\ndictator. \r\nWe also have to be thinking about all the refugees. \r\nUntil now, those refugees have been in neighbouring \r\ncountries, but there too, the international community \r\nturned a blind eye because it was far away. Today those \r\nrefugees, who can endure no more, are starting a long \r\nmarch. Yesterday, I recalled in the Assembly (see A/70/\r\nPV.11) that 80 per cent of the world’s refugees — refugees \r\nbecause of wars, conflicts, climate, poverty — are in \r\nthe South. Solidarity with the South is coming from the \r\nSouth. Frequently, it is the most deprived who welcome \r\nthe poorest. There comes a time when the refugees \r\nstart to walk, and they can no longer be stopped. If we \r\nwant to avoid what we have seen — tragedies, crossings \r\nthat endanger the lives of passengers — if we want to \r\nprevent smugglers and criminalsfrom using despair to \r\nfurther enrich the coffers of terrorism, then we must \r\nact.\r\nEurope has hosted refugees coming not only from \r\nSyria, but also from Iraq, Eritrea and the Sudan. That \r\nwas our duty, because Europe is based on values and \r\nprinciples, and the right to asylum is part of this common \r\nfoundation that unites all the European countries, and \r\nwhich must continue uniting them. Otherwise, it is not \r\nthe kind of Europe that we wanted. \r\nBut while Europe should discharge its duty, the \r\nworld must help refugees. What have we learned those \r\npast days and weeks? That the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), due to lack \r\nof funds, no longer has the resources to ensure the \r\nnecessary support and assistance to the populations in \r\nquestion. What have we learned? That the World Food \r\nProgramme no longer has the means to provide all the \r\nrefugees basic necessities and sufficient food. What \r\nhave we learned? That in some neighbouring countries, \r\nrefugees could not work.\r\nThis is the start of the cycle one would have \r\nimagined. If we want to reverse the f lows, if we \r\nwant to keep refugees as close as possible to their \r\nhome countries, then we must fund UNHCR more, \r\nwe must help neighbouring countries — Lebanon, \r\nJordan, Turkey — but also countries in Africa, transit \r\ncountries, countries where there is no migration. We \r\nneed a major plan now, because tragedy is calling to \r\nact and to avert other tragedies. In that context, too, \r\nFrance is doing what it can, and must do what it should. \r\nAnd concerning the World Food Programme, France \r\nhas decided to immediately increase by €100 million \r\nits support for United Nations agencies that are helping \r\ncountries neighbouring Syria.\r\nI want to end my speech by saying that the legitimacy \r\nof an Organization such as the United Nations rests on \r\nits credibility. If the United Nations does not have the \r\ncapacity to resolve conflicts that have been going on \r\nfor far too long, if the United Nations cannot resolve \r\ntragedies or ease the situation of civilian populations, \r\nthen our helplessness will condemn us. If we want our \r\n15-29265 41/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nOrganization — which is celebrating its seventieth \r\nanniversary — to have a future worthy of that which \r\nthe founders imagined, we cannot avoid reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nFrance calls for the enlargement of the Security \r\nCouncil. France calls for a different representation in the \r\nSecurity Council. France calls for continents to clearly \r\nbear responsibility for the world in the framework of \r\nthe Security Council. France wants the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council to no longer resort to \r\nthe right of veto in cases of mass atrocities. How can we \r\ntolerate that the United Nations, even today, remains \r\nparalysed when the worst is unfolding? There again, let \r\nus lead by example. I pledge here today that France will \r\nnever use its right of veto in matters involving mass \r\natrocities. The right of veto as it was introduced when \r\nthe United Nations was founded was not the right to \r\nblock; it was the right to act. We have to act. We can \r\nact. We have been showing that we can for 70 years. \r\nHere, today, we can act to settle the tragedies of today \r\nand to save the planet tomorrow. Let us act.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the French \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of \r\nthe Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique.\r\nMr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nyusi (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is with \r\ngreat honour that, once again, on behalf of the people of \r\nMozambique and, indeed, on my own behalf, I address \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session. As we \r\ncelebrate 70 years of our Organization, we are cognizant \r\nof the fact that we are not here just to commemorate \r\na mere event. We are also celebrating the realization \r\nof the desire to build a universal Organization that \r\ncarries out activities with a global perspective and with \r\na structured and institutionalized scope and a capacity \r\nto evolve and adapt. \r\nWe are celebrating one of the wisest decisions \r\nthat humankind has ever made, namely, to establish \r\nan international body responsible for peace, security \r\nand the development of member countries. It is an \r\nOrganization created to prevent humankind from \r\nexperiencing a world war or violent conflicts whose \r\neffects are felt at the global level. We are celebrating a \r\nmutual commitment to strengthen international law as \r\nan instrument for regulating and standardizing relations \r\nbetween and among States. Those relations are based \r\non the principle of sovereign equality among States, the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and non-interference \r\nin domestic affairs. Those positive and inspiring \r\nideals contrast, however, with the prevailing conflict \r\nsituations, which still affect humankind. We would \r\nnot be fair to ourselves, to our peoples or to future \r\ngenerations, if we ignored the challenges and failures \r\nthat are to be overcome. \r\nThe United Nations has failed to guarantee \r\ninternational peace and security in its full sense. Old \r\nand new challenges have emerged, and inter- and \r\nintra-State conflicts have proliferated, particularly \r\nin Africa and the Middle East. The phenomenon \r\nof terrorism is growing and becoming the most \r\nserious threat of our time. Decolonization is yet to \r\nbe completed. Underdevelopment, exacerbated by the \r\nproblem of refugees and illegal migration, is far from \r\nbecoming a thing of the past. However, those failures \r\nshould not be regarded fatalistically. They should be \r\ntaken up as challenges, which require more than mere \r\nwords as a response. Most importantly, they require \r\nconcerted action by the international community. \r\nWithout the United Nations, the political, economic and \r\nsocial context in which we find ourselves would surely \r\nbe worse.\r\nIn celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, the theme for this session, “A new \r\ncommitment to action”, represents a reaffirmation \r\nof our commitment to keep alive our objective of \r\nprotecting future generations from the violence of \r\nwar and to ensure inclusive social and economic \r\ndevelopment in full freedom. There is, therefore, one \r\nresponse to those phenomena and trends, and that is \r\n42/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nto translate the theme, “A new commitment to action”, \r\ninto concrete, structured and tangible actions. For \r\nMozambique, the commitment to action in the area of \r\ninternational peace and security includes, inter alia, the \r\nadoption and implementation of effective structures for \r\nthe prevention and management of conflicts, as well as \r\nthe need to conclude a convention against terrorism. \r\nThe emphasis should be on preventive diplomacy. The \r\ncommitment to action that we are celebrating here \r\nshould establish platforms for dialogue among cultures \r\nand civilizations as an essential tool for promoting \r\ntolerance, the culture of peace and a dignified and \r\npeaceful world. \r\nWith respect to development, we are delighted \r\nat the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda \r\nin the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which is our new global \r\ndevelopment framework for the next 15 years. It is \r\nan agenda that follows and builds on the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which have guided us over the \r\npast 15 years. Therefore, any action we take in future \r\nshould not ignore the successes achieved and lessons \r\nlearned. Like other countries, Mozambique has \r\nachieved remarkable progress in the implementation of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We have expanded \r\naccess to education, improved gender balance in access \r\nto primary education and met the target set for infant- \r\nmortality reduction.\r\nThe new post-2015 development agenda embodies \r\nour collective ambition to transform the world by \r\n2030. The new Agenda brings back human dignity by \r\nfighting poverty and protecting people and the planet. \r\nAt the core of the new Agenda is the culmination of \r\na series of negotiation processes, at the global level, \r\non climate change. The new post-2015 development \r\nagenda is perfectly in line with our Government’s \r\nfive-year programme. It is not an end in itself, but it has \r\nthe added value of focusing on people. It is founded on \r\nthe so-called sustainable development pillars, namely, \r\nthe economic, social and environmental dimensions. \r\nIt is our desire that we should meet in 2030, at \r\nanother historic event just like this one, to celebrate \r\nthe implementation of the goals and common vision, \r\nas reflected in the new Agenda, whose full title is \r\n“Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development”. If that is to be possible, \r\nMozambique maintains that, among other things, it is \r\nof paramount importance that the commitment to action \r\ninclude the need to mobilize the requisite resources in \r\na timely manner. Significant resources will be required \r\nfor the implementation of the new Agenda if it is to \r\nmaintain  continuous relevance. In that regard, we \r\nmust follow the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities and keep in mind how important it is \r\nthat all partners respect the commitments made and \r\nthe agreed international development goals. It is also \r\nimportant that the appropriate technology transfers \r\nto developing countries take place and that aid be \r\ngranted without political conditionalities. We must also \r\nstrengthen North-South, South-South, and bilateral and \r\nmultilateral cooperation mechanisms in accordance \r\nwith internationally agreed principles and respect for \r\nnational realities and local content.\r\nAs all may be aware, Mozambique was one of the \r\n50 countries selected by the United Nations to host \r\nnational consultations. That sample contributed to the \r\ndevelopment of the new guiding instrument that is the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1). The process included the broadest spectrum \r\nof social and professional elements, and, to our \r\nsatisfaction, its results were taken into consideration in \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/70/1).\r\nIf the post-2015 development Agenda is to be truly \r\ntransformative and successful, it must be integrated \r\ninto and owned  by policymaking instruments at the \r\nnational level. Indicators and targets should be defined \r\nclearly to facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of \r\nprogress. Mozambique has already taken an important \r\nstep by incorporating the three-dimensional approach \r\nof the post-2015 development Agenda into the \r\nGovernment’s five-year programme 2015-2019, which \r\ndefines five priorities, namely: consolidating national \r\nunity, peace and sovereignty; developing human and \r\nsocial capital; promoting employment, productivity \r\nand competitiveness; developing economic and social \r\ninfrastructures; and ensuring the sustainable and \r\ntransparent management of natural resources and the \r\nenvironment. We reiterate here our commitment to \r\ncontinued capacity-building in the area of domestic \r\nresources mobilization, which increased from 13 per \r\ncent of our gross domestic product in 2006 to 25 per \r\ncent in 2014.\r\nThe inability of the United Nations to fully achieve \r\nthe purpose for which it was established is one of the \r\nissues that concern us. It is hard to understand why the \r\nUnited Nations is hampering the implementation of its \r\nown mandate. We should be here today to celebrate the \r\ncompletion of the reform of the Security Council and \r\n15-29265 43/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nthe opening up of new opportunities to create a world in \r\nwhich people enjoy the most basic rights, including peace \r\nand development. The role of that reform in providing \r\nunderlying support for the successful implementation \r\nof the post-2015 development Agenda should not be \r\nunderestimated. We should therefore translate our \r\nrenewed mutual will to reform the Security Council \r\ninto practical results, and we should take advantage \r\nof the environment created for this session to provide \r\ngreater dynamism to the reform process.\r\nThe celebration of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations and the adoption of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment Agenda are being overshadowed by an \r\nunprecedented crisis at the international level. I am \r\nreferring to the humanitarian crisis caused by a f low \r\nof refugees and migrants that is unparalleled in recent \r\nhistory. That shocking situation is due to a succession of \r\nunresolved crises and to poorly handled situations with \r\noutcomes that are far from meeting the expectations of \r\nthe international community. \r\nToday we are committed to adopting measures to \r\nminimize the plight of those people. However, little \r\nwill be achieved if we continue to focus on short-term \r\ncosmetic measures, rather than respond to the need \r\nto curtail the f low of refugees and migrants at the \r\nsource. We need to address the underlying problems \r\nof this phenomenon, which explain the tragic human \r\nproportions of the crisis. We will be in no position to \r\nidentify effective actions unless we, the international \r\ncommunity, recognize our own failure. We are talking \r\nabout the proliferation of conflicts and political, social \r\nand economic exclusion. We are talking about poverty, \r\ninjustice and hunger.\r\nWe have noted how dialogue has been replaced by \r\nthreats and aggression. We have noted how fear has \r\nreplaced a willingness to achieve mutual agreement. \r\nSome of the ways to address the situation have been \r\nknown for a long time. In that regard, we call upon all \r\nleaders to redouble their efforts to find lasting solutions \r\nto the humanitarian crisis. We have followed with \r\nkeen interest and much satisfaction the latest positive \r\ndevelopments aimed at normalizing bilateral relations \r\nbetween the United States of America and Cuba. We \r\ncontinue to encourage actions aimed at ending the \r\neconomic, trade and financial embargo against Cuba, \r\nwithout prejudice to the legitimate interests of any of \r\nthose concerned. Although we may meet all of the targets \r\nof the post-2015 development Agenda, our mission as \r\nan international community will not be complete until \r\nwe use wisdom and implement the political processes.\r\nAs is well known, Mozambique was one of the \r\ncountries most affected by the presence of landmines. \r\nIn acknowledgement  of the importance of mine \r\nclearance for promoting an atmosphere of peace, \r\nsecurity and development, Mozambique became a \r\nparty to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \r\nStockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel \r\nMines and on Their Destruction, also known as the \r\nOttawa Convention. From the outset, we have made \r\nevery effort to comply with the obligations arising from \r\nthe Ottawa Convention. In that regard, I am pleased to \r\nannounce that Mozambique has successfully completed \r\nits demining programme. We have cleared all known \r\nrisk areas, which totalled 500 million square metres of \r\nland.\r\nMr. Waqa (Nauru), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIt would not have been worthwhile for us to \r\nliberate our country if then we had been forbidden to \r\ntravel across our country, or if we had been forbidden \r\nto farm the land or develop tourism or mine our coal \r\nor graphite. We celebrate that victory with intense \r\nemotion. We would like to express our profound \r\ngratitude to our international partners, humanitarian \r\ndemining organizations, United Nations agencies \r\nand civil society for their cooperation and invaluable \r\nsupport.\r\nThe year 2015 is of special importance to \r\nMozambique. On 25 June, we celebrated 40 years of \r\nindependence. We are no longer an adolescent State. \r\nOn 16 September we celebrated 40 years of cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations. I am  jubilant because I am \r\nspeaking here today, at the United Nations, and I believe \r\nthat the United Nations should feel proud on account of \r\nmy country’s stability and growth — growth that needs \r\nto be supported. \r\nI would like to conclude my remarks by reiterating \r\nthat the search for sustainable solutions to global \r\nproblems, alongside the Organization and its Member \r\nStates, will continue to be the focus of my Government’s \r\nunconditional commitment. Long live humankind and \r\nsustainable development!\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique for the statement he has just made.\r\n44/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nMr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Willem-Alexander, \r\nKing of the Kingdom of the Netherlands\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the King of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands.\r\nHis Majesty King Willem-Alexander, King of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency King Willem-Alexander, King \r\nof the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nKing Willem-Alexander: It is a privilege to address \r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands, a Kingdom made up of four autonomous \r\ncountries — the Netherlands, Aruba, Curaçao and Saint \r\nMaarten — rooted in both Europe and the Caribbean. \r\nIn 1945, the Charter of the United Nations was \r\nsigned by representatives of 51 countries. Today, \r\n70 years later, there are three times as many people \r\non the Earth and four times as many Member States, \r\nwith all the complexities that that entails. And yet, \r\nas an international Organization, the United Nations \r\nstands proud. In those 70 years, the world has seen \r\ngreat upheavals and shifts in the balance of power. \r\nTechnological advances have changed our daily lives \r\nfaster and more dramatically than ever before, and yet, \r\nthe United Nations endures. We have seen clashes of \r\ninterests, bitter conflicts and human tragedies, which, \r\nindeed, persist today. As we speak, the lives of millions \r\nare still dominated by fear, oppression and want. And \r\nyet, the United Nations lives on as a legitimate platform \r\nfor international dialogue where countries can always \r\ncome together, no matter how great their differences.\r\nThe United Nations is more than simply a platform. \r\nIt is an Organization whose activities help to shape \r\nand improve our world. Thanks in part to the United \r\nNations, extreme poverty has been halved, child \r\nmortality has been halved, 2.3 billion people have \r\ngained access to drinking water, diseases such as \r\nmalaria and tuberculosis have been beaten back, and \r\npeace operations in many areas have brought violent \r\nconflicts under control. That is all because of the \r\nwork of millions of courageous people in the  Member \r\nStates and the untiring efforts of the staff of the United \r\nNations and its organs, both here in New York and all \r\nover the world. So I would like to say to the United \r\nNations: congratulations! I thank it for 70 years of \r\nbattling against cynicism and fatalism.\r\nFor the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the United \r\nNations is and will remain the primary global \r\nOrganization for peace, justice and development. That \r\nis why the Kingdom is a candidate for a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council for the 2017-2018 term.\r\nOf course, the world is far from perfect. It is still \r\nfilled with terrible injustice and human suffering. \r\nBut we have also made great progress. What would \r\ntoday’s world look like without the United Nations? \r\nThere can be no doubt that we would be worse off. The \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands feels a close bond with the \r\nfundamentals of the United Nations, as laid down in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We understand the value \r\nof diversity and dialogue. This goes hand in hand with \r\nthe conviction that multilateral cooperation can help us \r\nmove forward and make the world stronger.\r\nWe owe our freedom to other countries. Seventy \r\nyears ago our allies made enormous sacrifices in \r\nliberating the Netherlands. They enabled us to rise \r\nagain and become a prosperous Kingdom. We will never \r\nforget the importance of international solidarity. The \r\nworld will always be able to count on the Netherlands \r\nas a partner for peace, justice and development.\r\nYet, just as we remain deeply committed, we also \r\nbelieve in being critical when necessary. It is good, on \r\nthis seventieth anniversary, for the United Nations to \r\nlook openly and honestly at the results of its efforts, to \r\nlook at the goals that have not been achieved and at the \r\nlong and winding path that lies ahead. Our Kingdom \r\nis gravely concerned about the lawlessness, terror and \r\ncontempt for basic human rights that are gaining ground \r\nin some areas. Millions of desperate people have been \r\ndisplaced and forced to f lee the violence. They are \r\nthe innocent victims of intolerance and of despicable \r\nconduct on the part of tyrants they cannot constrain. \r\nMany refugees have been in a desperate situation \r\nfor too long. The positive effects of years of work on \r\nsustainable development are at risk, and this affects us \r\nall. We cannot look the other way.\r\nWe are all deeply touched by the tragic images of \r\nfamilies who have had to leave everything behind in \r\ntheir search for a safe haven. All the world’s nations \r\n15-29265 45/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nmust show solidarity in the face of the refugee crisis. \r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands has again increased \r\nits contribution to humanitarian assistance, making it \r\none of the largest donors in the world. We call on other \r\nnations to follow suit and give additional support to the \r\nUnited Nations, so that it can provide food and shelter \r\nto all those who have been forced to f lee and give them \r\na chance to rebuild their lives.\r\nIt is crucial that we make our joint efforts on peace \r\nand security more efficient and effective. The review \r\nby the High-level Independent Panel on United Nations \r\nPeace Operations is a helpful tool in that regard.\r\nSince the United Nations was founded, the Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands has participated in 63 United \r\nNations or United Nations-mandated missions in more \r\nthan 30 countries. Those missions have involved more \r\nthan 125,000 Dutch military and civilian personnel. \r\nEarlier this year, I visited the Dutch men and women \r\nwho are part of the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali. The situation \r\nthere clearly illustrates how complex the problems \r\nin conflict areas often are. You cannot build lasting \r\npeace by military means alone. A political solution has \r\nto be found. It is equally important to strengthen the \r\ninstitutions that safeguard respect for the rule of law \r\nand to remove the underlying causes of conflict.\r\nThe lack of decent prospects or equal opportunities \r\ndrives many young people into the arms of ruthless \r\nterrorist organizations. Discrimination and exclusion \r\nare the root of much evil in the world. That is why we \r\nneed a three-dimensional approach: a combination \r\nof defence, development and diplomacy, of which the \r\nNetherlands has many years of experience. For example, \r\nwe have made it a top priority to stimulate job creation \r\nin Africa and to assist young African entrepreneurs, \r\nand we are increasing our support for programmes to \r\npromote stability in fragile States.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is proud to be \r\nhome to the International Court of Justice, the only \r\nprincipal organ of the United Nations located outside \r\nNew York. The Hague is the place where global \r\npeace, justice and security are defended by a range of \r\ninternational organizations, including the International \r\nCriminal Court and the Organization for the Prohibition \r\nof Chemical Weapons.\r\nA key feature of a legal order is the absence of \r\nimpunity. Violence must never be allowed to prevail. \r\nLawlessness must never become the norm. Anyone \r\nwho strives for justice will find our Kingdom on their \r\nside. Injustice hurts like an open wound. Hundreds \r\nof families from 10 countries, including Malaysia, \r\nAustralia and the Netherlands, still grieve every day for \r\nthe loved ones they lost in the Malaysia Airlines Flight \r\nMH-17 air disaster. They await the results of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2166 (2014). That resolution is very \r\nclear: it demands that those responsible for this incident \r\nbe held to account and that all States cooperate fully \r\nwith efforts to establish accountability. The Dutch \r\nGovernment will work tirelessly, together with all the \r\ncountries and organizations concerned, until justice is \r\ndone with regard to this tragedy.\r\nPeace, justice and development are closely linked. \r\nThey are a trinity, as tied to each other as the blades on \r\na windmill. To achieve lasting progress, all three are \r\nessential. So our Kingdom welcomes the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which will focus the efforts of the \r\ninternational community over the next 15 years. And \r\nwe will put our hearts and souls into helping ensure \r\ntheir success.\r\nThere is still not enough focus on the positive \r\nrole that women can play. Even in the harshest and \r\nmost hopeless circumstances, women often have the \r\nstrength to go on and to find practical ways to improve \r\nthe lives of their families and communities. Promoting \r\nequal rights and opportunities for women is actually \r\nsustainable development in action. Any organization \r\nthat wants to remain relevant must adapt to new times \r\nand circumstances. It is especially important for \r\ninstitutions that stand for shared values and continuity \r\nto critically examine their own performance and \r\nto ask themselves: “Are our working methods still \r\nappropriate?” Without such self-reflection they risk the \r\ngradual erosion of their relevance and effectiveness.\r\nFor the United Nations and the Security Council \r\nthis has, after 70 years, become an urgent issue. The \r\nSecurity Council needs to be able to act more boldly in \r\nthe face of large-scale atrocities. Greater restraint in the \r\nuse of vetoes would help. We warmly welcome France’s \r\ninitiative in that regard. The Council’s legitimacy is also \r\nunder pressure. If part of the global population feels \r\ninsufficiently represented by it, the Security Council \r\ncannot properly fulfil its primary role as a global body \r\nfor safeguarding peace and security and for resolving \r\nconflicts. Africa, in particular, is underrepresented, but \r\nthe voices of other regions and countries are not being \r\nheard enough either. This needs to change.\r\n46/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands believes in the \r\npower of empathy and dialogue. It is not always the \r\nloudest voices that speak the deepest truths. In fact, it \r\nis often the small Member States that show us the way \r\nforward. One example is the longtime plea by small \r\nisland States for a far more active global approach to \r\nclimate change and marine pollution. They feel the \r\nurgency like no other. Fortunately — finally — more \r\nand more large countries are developing concrete action \r\nplans.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands knows how crucial \r\nthis is. Three of our countries — Aruba, Curaçao and \r\nSaint Maarten — are small island States, and three \r\nother Caribbean islands are special municipalities of the \r\nNetherlands. With its centuries of water-management \r\nexperience, the Netherlands is one of the best-protected \r\ndeltas in the world, investing billions to help mitigate \r\nthe effects of climate change. That is why we intend to \r\nmake sure our voice is heard at the twenty-first session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris \r\nlater this year, and we will continue pressing for cleaner \r\noceans.\r\nOur guiding principle is simple — consider the \r\ninterests of all countries, large and small. Forget might \r\nis right. We believe right is might. This also forms \r\nthe basis of our candidacy for a seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the 2017-2018 term. We are passionate \r\nabout serving the entire international community at the \r\nUnited Nations level as a partner for peace, justice and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nFor my wife and me, this has a very personal \r\nsignificance. For seven years I had the honour of being \r\nthe Chair of the Secretary-General’s Advisory Board \r\non Water and Sanitation. My wife remains his Special \r\nAdvocate for Inclusive Finance for Development. Two \r\nyears ago, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon spoke at \r\nthe centennial celebrations of the Peace Palace in The \r\nHague. He said, “Here in The Hague, you help sustain \r\nand expand the rule of law. You bring the rule of law to \r\nlife.” We took those warm words not merely as a great \r\ncompliment, but also as an inspirational challenge, \r\na solemn task, which we aim to continue fulfilling, \r\ntogether with all Member States in The Hague, in New \r\nYork and all over the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of the Kingdom of \r\nthe Netherlands for the statement he has just made. \r\nHis Majesty King Willem-Alexander, King of the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of \r\nthe Republic of Kazakhstan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan.\r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Kazakhstan, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nazarbayev (spoke in Kazakh; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): In this seventieth \r\nanniversary year, it is fitting that we reflect on the \r\nprofound hopes of the founders of the United Nations. \r\nThis universal Organization has already achieved \r\nhistoric goals of universal significance. First, for \r\nseven decades our planet has lived without world wars. \r\nSecondly, we have witnessed large-scale decolonization. \r\nSeventy years ago, the United Nations was established \r\nby 51 States at a time when the majority of the world \r\nstill consisted of colonies and dependent territories. \r\nToday, the world community includes 193 independent \r\ncountries. Thirdly, the United Nations has become a \r\nuniversal platform for dialogue, which is essential for \r\nthe sake of security and development. In the United \r\nNations, humankind recognizes its unity in diversity \r\nand the need for shared participation in shaping the fate \r\nof our planet. The generation that founded the United \r\nNations was wise enough to look far into the future. \r\nThe world today is reaping the benefits of their dreams \r\nand hard work.\r\nKazakhstan supports all initiatives aimed \r\nat restoring trust in international relations and \r\nstrengthening peace and security on the basis of \r\ninternational law. For seven decades, the world \r\ncommunity has tried to find an effective formula for \r\nresolving military conflicts. However, the number of \r\nconflicts has not decreased. Rather, conflicts are often \r\ntransforming into more sophisticated and complex \r\nforms of international terrorism, as may occur in a \r\nclimate of State collapse.\r\n15-29265 47/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nHumankind needs to shift its focus from routine \r\nconflict prevention and post-conflict rehabilitation \r\nto a new development strategy that would make such \r\nconflicts meaningless. To that end, we should find the \r\ncourage to look beyond the present to the time when the \r\nUnited Nations will celebrate its centenary. I believe \r\nthat, in the next thirty years, the civilized world will \r\nfind the necessary wisdom and will to cut through the \r\nGordian knot of wars and conflicts. Our central task \r\nin the twenty-first century should be to implement a \r\nstrategy that will, once and for all, eliminate the threat \r\nof war and its causes. To that end, I propose that, for \r\nthe centenary of the United Nations, agreement should \r\nbe reached on a 2045 global strategic initiative plan, \r\nwhose core idea will be to launch a new trend in global \r\ndevelopment based on equitable conditions in which \r\nall nations have equal access to global infrastructure, \r\nresources and markets and accountability for human \r\ndevelopment is comprehensively maintained.\r\nFirst, I propose that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil be transformed into a global development \r\ncouncil. Membership of the new body would consist \r\nof Member States elected by the General Assembly \r\nand the heads of all the United Nations specialized \r\nagencies, including the International Monetary Fund. \r\nThe new Council should be tasked with becoming a \r\nglobal economic regulator. Global projects carried out \r\nby such a Council would aim to promote worldwide \r\neconomic growth. That would go a long way towards \r\ndecreasing the risks of global crises and to ensuring \r\nresponsible behaviour by States, while enabling them \r\nto maintain their national economic and social policies.\r\nWe consider the idea of a world anti-crisis plan, the \r\ndraft of which is being actively discussed on the margins \r\nof the Astana Economic Forum, to be very timely. The \r\nmost pressing and serious global challenges — terrorism, \r\nthe implosion of States, migration and other negative \r\nissues — are the result of the economic crisis, poverty, \r\nilliteracy and unemployment.\r\nTo tackle the global crisis, we need to start with clear \r\nrules for the issuance of and trade in the world’s reserve \r\ncurrencies, because they do not now meet the criteria of \r\njustice, democracy, competitiveness, effectiveness and \r\ninternational control. In the twenty-first century, our \r\nworld needs new, high-quality financial instruments. \r\nStates Members of the United Nations need to join \r\nforces to create a new supranational currency that \r\nshould be relevant to the targets and tasks of global \r\nsustainable development and prosperity.\r\nSecondly, in the year of the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \r\nI urge that a world without nuclear weapons should \r\nbecome the main goal of humankind for the twenty-first \r\ncentury. I propose that we adopt, under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations, a universal declaration aimed at \r\nachieving a world free of nuclear weapons. Kazakhstan \r\nwas the first country in history to close down a nuclear \r\ntest site, renouncing the world’s fourth-largest nuclear \r\narsenal, and has contributed to the creation of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in Central Asia. It is essential to \r\nestablish nuclear-weapon-free zones in other regions of \r\nthe world, particularly in the Middle East. The nuclear \r\nPowers must provide guarantees of the non-use of force \r\nto all countries that renounce possession of nuclear \r\nweapons.\r\nIn 2013, we initiated two rounds of talks on the \r\nIranian nuclear programme in Almaty. We welcome \r\nthe signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\nregarding Iran’s nuclear programme. It is essential today \r\nto guarantee the right of States to peaceful nuclear energy \r\nand access to nuclear fuel. That is why we supported \r\nand signed an agreement with the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency on the establishment of a low-enriched \r\nuranium fuel bank in Kazakhstan. That was an event \r\nof global significance. The world should acknowledge \r\nit as an important measure for the safe and peaceful \r\nuse of the atom, as it means that countries wishing \r\nto develop nuclear energy no longer need to enrich \r\nuranium themselves. Moreover, we consider the \r\ncreation of a global anti-nuclear-weapons movement \r\nan important task. Every person on the planet can and \r\nmust contribute to a nuclear test ban.\r\nThirdly, a further danger for us is the erosion of \r\ninternational law and the weakening of the role of \r\nglobal institutions. It is important to remember that \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations was written with the \r\nblood of millions of victims of world wars and armed \r\nconflicts. Any violation of its articles, especially with \r\nrespect to ensuring the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of States, may cause humankind to repeat the \r\ntragic mistakes of the past.\r\nIt is crucial to prevent the arbitrary imposition \r\nof sanctions, which contradicts both the Charter and \r\ninternational law. I am convinced that the right to impose \r\ninternational sanctions, which can adversely affect \r\nthe well-being of millions of people, should remain \r\nthe exclusive prerogative of the Security Council. \r\nFailure to comply with that principle undermines the \r\n48/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nfoundation of the modern world order and is a relic \r\nof the Cold War. I would like to stress that there is \r\nno alternative to the United Nations as a universal \r\nOrganization. Moreover, countries’ compliance with \r\ntheir international obligations remains the cornerstone \r\nof the modern world order.\r\nKazakhstan has consistently advocated a \r\npeaceful settlement of the Ukrainian crisis and the \r\nfull implementation of the Minsk agreements by the \r\nparties to the conflict. Today it is vital to make every \r\neffort to restore dialogue, mutual understanding and \r\ntrust in international relations. I therefore propose the \r\nconvening in 2016 of a United Nations conference at \r\nthe highest level with the aim of reaffirming the basic \r\nprinciples of international law.\r\nFourthly, the threat of terrorism and religious \r\nextremism has become global in scale. I propose the \r\nestablishment, under the auspices of the United Nations, \r\nof a unified global network to counter international \r\nterrorism and extremism. To achieve that objective, it is \r\nnecessary to develop and adopt a comprehensive United \r\nNations instrument on combating terrorism.\r\nFifthly, in support of the United Nations initiative \r\non sustainable energy for all, we will hold, in 2017 in \r\nAstana, an international exhibition on the theme of the \r\nenergy of the future. We invite all States to participate \r\nfully in the exhibition. Looking to the future and using \r\nthe infrastructure to be put in place for Expo 2017, I \r\nsuggest opening in Astana an international centre for \r\nthe development of green technologies and investment \r\nprojects under the auspices of the United Nations.\r\nA major step in realizing the 2045 global strategic \r\ninitiative plan could be the development, under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations, of the concept on \r\nwhich a new future is to be based. Seventy years after \r\nthe founding of the United Nations, we need to clearly \r\ndefine the goals of the next stage in the evolution of \r\nhumankind. I believe that that new future will be about \r\nways to deliver nuclear energy and water, address food \r\nsecurity, build trust and mutual understanding and \r\ncarry out reforms.\r\nKazakhstan has been and will continue to be \r\na mediator in efforts to help conflicting parties in \r\nEurasia to find a peaceful solution. The directions and \r\nprinciples I have outlined constitute the core of our \r\ncampaign to become a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the biennium 2017-2018. I call \r\non all those participating in the seventieth session to \r\nsupport our country’s candidacy.\r\nSeventy years ago, when the United Nations was \r\nestablished as a replacement for the defunct League of \r\nNations, which had been located in Geneva, the decision \r\nwas made to establish its headquarters in New York. \r\nThat was connected to the fact that, at the time, the \r\nrole of the Western hemisphere in international affairs \r\nwas still in the ascendant. The centre of economic \r\ndevelopment had also moved from the Old World of \r\nEurope to the New World of the United States, in New \r\nYork.\r\nOur world has changed a great deal since then. In \r\nthe twenty-first century, the pole of global growth is \r\nshifting to Asia, the world’s largest continent, where \r\ntwo thirds of the planet’s population lives and where \r\nenormous resources are concentrated. The powerful \r\nrise of Asia’s developing economies has introduced \r\na new reality into global processes. We need to use \r\nthat historic change and opportunity to give a new \r\nboost to relations between States. With that in mind, I \r\npropose that Member States consider the possibility of \r\ntransferring United Nations Headquarters to Asia. I am \r\nhopeful that this and Kazakhstan’s other proposals will \r\nbe acceptable to the community of nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Kazakhstan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the \r\nRepublic of Kazakhstan, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of \r\nthe United Mexican States\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the United Mexican \r\nStates.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto, \r\nPresident of the United Mexican States, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Peña Nieto (spoke in Spanish): Seventy \r\nyears ago, the United Nations was founded as a collective \r\n15-29265 49/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nresponse to the horror of war. For seven decades, the \r\npeoples of the United Nations have been determined to \r\nimplement the highest ideals of international peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and social progress.\r\nThe ongoing efforts of the United Nations in favour \r\nof these lofty goals are reflected in the peacekeeping \r\noperations and the actions of such prestigious agencies \r\nas the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations, the United Nations Children’s Fund, the \r\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural \r\nOrganization, the World Health Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme. It must be \r\nsaid clearly — the world would not be the same without \r\nthe United Nations, symbol of solidarity and hope for a \r\nbetter future.\r\nSince 1945, Mexicans have maintained the greatest \r\ncommitment to this forum, which is the greatest \r\nmultilateral mechanism there is, championing peace, \r\nnuclear disarmament and humankind’s loftiest goals. \r\nFor example, following the Cuban missile crisis, Mexico \r\npromoted the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons in Latin America and the Caribbean. Thanks \r\nto this agreement, the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nnations became the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a \r\ndensely populated region. \r\nMexicans also have a long tradition as a mediator in \r\nconflicts in our region, always promoting the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. In the light of this history, \r\nwe welcome the substantial progress in the peace \r\nprocess in Colombia, as well as the recent restoration \r\nof diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. Consistent with this new geopolitical reality, we \r\nreiterate the call for ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed on Cuba since 1962.\r\nTo continue contributing to peace among societies \r\nof the world, Mexico recently pushed for the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty, which is now a reality. The Treaty is the \r\nbasis of an international regime of conventional arms \r\ncontrol, which prevents illegal traffic and makes the \r\nlegal trade in arms more transparent.\r\nMexico is a nation fully committed to upholding \r\nthe law, human rights and peace. We have fully \r\nassumed the great responsibility of being a member \r\nof the Human Rights Council of the United Nations \r\nfor the 2014-2016 triennium. Today, my country has \r\nsome of the most advanced legislation in favour of \r\nhuman rights and works to ensure that it is enforced \r\nthroughout the national territory. Moreover, I am \r\nconvinced — and the facts bear this out — that the \r\nexperience and contributions of the international \r\ncommunity have helped to further our domestic efforts \r\nin the field. The imminent visit to Mexico of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights is a \r\nclear demonstration of our commitment and will to \r\ncontinue to join efforts with the international system. \r\nAnother clear example of our responsibility at \r\nthe global level was the decision to participate in \r\npeacekeeping operations. Our historic resolve has \r\nmeant that my country has put its experience in the \r\nfield of humanitarian assistance at the service of the \r\nUnited Nations. The foregoing are just some examples \r\nof the close and positive relationship that Mexico has \r\nhad with the United Nations for 70 years. \r\nAs a result of growing inequalities, an unrelenting \r\nglobal economic crisis and the social frustration \r\nresulting therefrom, the world today is exposed to the \r\nthreat of new populist movements, some on the left and \r\nothers on the right, but all equally risky. The twentieth \r\ncentury has already lived through and suffered the \r\nconsequences of the actions of individuals who, \r\ndevoid of understanding and a sense of responsibility \r\nand without a moral compass, chose to divide their \r\npopulations. Societies must be vigilant against those \r\nwho prey on fears and worries and those who sow \r\nhatred and rancour with the sole purpose of satisfying \r\npolitical agendas and personal ambitions.\r\nIn this second decade of the twenty-first century, \r\nwe must not repeat the mistakes that caused the world \r\nso much pain in the past. On the contrary, it is time \r\nto rescue and support the principles that define us as \r\npeople: the lofty values  that gave birth to the United \r\nNations, namely, peace, solidarity and respect for \r\nhuman rights — respect for migrants, respect for \r\nwomen, respect for all races and religions, respect for \r\ndiversity and political pluralism, but, above all, respect \r\nfor human dignity. That is what our societies deserve.\r\nTrue, today’s world is complex, uncertain, almost \r\nbeyond our reach. But division is not a solution. We \r\nmust again appreciate the true worth of trust— trust in \r\nconstructive work, trust in others, trust in institutions \r\nand, above all, trust in ourselves and our nations.\r\nTo build, one must add; to achieve, one must \r\npersevere. Indeed, 2015 is proving to us that nations can \r\nachieve transcendent, bold and innovative agreements \r\nthat benefit the world’s population. The 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), the \r\n50/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 \r\nand the work leading up to the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change  on Climate \r\nChange are of historic importance and promote a new \r\nparadigm — a change in the way nations think and act.\r\nThe way in which the 2030 Agenda was constructed \r\nshould be welcomed. It was compiled collectively \r\nand unanimously, from the dialogues and proposals \r\nsubmitted by Member States. The Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda, adopted at the third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Ethiopia, will \r\nenable States to finance sustainable development, which \r\nis the foundation of a revitalized global partnership, as \r\nthe Secretary-General himself has stated. For its part, \r\nthe Sendai Framework provides guidelines for the \r\nnext 15 years that will give the people of the world an \r\nopportunity to enjoy a more secure home. \r\nAs for the upcoming twenty-first Conference of \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, there are high expectations that \r\nwe will be able to adopt binding commitments in Paris. \r\nUndoubtedly, climate change is one of the greatest \r\nchallenges of the day, and its solution requires the \r\nclear and firm political will of every country. In that \r\nregard, on 27 March Mexico introduced its nationally \r\ndetermined contribution, and was the first developing \r\ncountry to do so. From this rostrum, I reiterate our call \r\non all nations of the world to act with determination and \r\nvision in response to the challenge of climate change.\r\nEncouraged by the major agreements of 2015, we are \r\nnow moving forward on the reform and modernization \r\nof the Security Council. The design of that important \r\nmechanism, created in 1945, has already demonstrated \r\nsignificant limitations. It is unacceptable that the \r\npower of the veto has been used for exclusively national \r\npurposes, thereby holding back potential international \r\naction. The permanent members of the Security Council \r\nhave a special responsibility for international peace and \r\nsecurity, which they must assume at all times, especially \r\nwhen the most basic human rights are violated. With \r\nthat objective in mind, we have supported the initiative \r\nof France to restrict the use of the veto in cases of \r\nserious breach of international law and human rights \r\nviolations, such as war crimes, crimes against humanity \r\nand genocide. The aim is to ensure that United Nations \r\nresolutions are more effective, responsible and, above \r\nall, more representative of the ideals of humankind.\r\nIn the global era, no country is immune to what \r\nhappens elsewhere in the world. We cannot remain \r\nindifferent to the suffering of entire populations. It is \r\na fact that our time is characterized by the migration \r\nof millions of people seeking better living conditions. \r\nUnfortunately, on all continents and in all areas, \r\nthe migrant experience is one of risk, rejection, \r\ndiscrimination and abuse. Those conditions are \r\naggravated when, because of ignorance, bad faith, \r\nracism or pure political opportunism, migrants and \r\ntheir children are stigmatized and blamed for the \r\ndestination country’s own difficulties. We must not \r\nallow that injustice to continue. We must not allow the \r\ndemocracies of the world to be robbed of their pluralistic \r\nand inclusive spirit. In the light of those visions of \r\nexclusion and discrimination, we must unite our efforts \r\nto create a global scheme to protect migrants’ rights \r\ncommensurate with the challenges we are experiencing. \r\nAround the world, millions of migrants require a \r\ncollective and effective response — a global response \r\nthat should come from the United Nations. \r\nSimilarly, given the scarce results achieved during \r\nthe past decades, humankind must reassess its vision \r\nof the global drug problem. In Mexico, we consider it \r\nindispensable to have a more effective, just and humane \r\ninternational response. In 2016, during the upcoming \r\nspecial session of the General Assembly on drugs, the \r\ninternational community must demonstrate collective \r\nwillingness to break its inertia and develop policies \r\nthat put the well-being and dignity of individuals at the \r\nheart of our attention.\r\nEnsuring the purposes and principles that gave \r\nbirth to the United Nations is a responsibility that \r\nunites and commits us all. Mexico publicly expresses \r\nits appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his work at the head of the United Nations. The \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is an \r\noverwhelming example of the inclusive leadership that \r\nthe world requires.\r\nOn this, the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, Mexico reaffirms its unwavering commitment \r\nto the Organization that unites nations and calls upon \r\nthem to work together. We do so in the conviction that \r\nmultilateralism is the ideal way to overcome global \r\nproblems. We do so in the conviction that through \r\nsupport for the United Nations we can help build a \r\nbetter future for all humankind.\r\n15-29265 51/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the United \r\nMexican States for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Portugal\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPortugal.\r\nMr. Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, President of \r\nthe Republic of Portugal, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Aníbal António Cavaco \r\nSilva, President of the Republic of Portugal, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Cavaco Silva (spoke in Portuguese, \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session on his election and to \r\nexpress my good wishes for the success of the General \r\nAssembly’s work in the seventieth-anniversary year of \r\nthe United Nations. I would also like to express my deep \r\nappreciation for the work of the Secretary-General. As \r\never, he can continue to count on Portugal’s support.\r\nThe establishment of the United Nations marked \r\na unique time in the collective history of humankind. \r\nThe pursuit of lasting peace, development and the \r\nrespect for human rights, the founding purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Organization that we still look to \r\ntoday, after 70 years, are major achievements of the \r\ncontemporary world. The Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the principles and values that it encapsulates \r\nremain a reference and a sign of hope for our collective \r\nfuture. I welcome the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which is an \r\nunparalleled opportunity to usher in an era in which \r\npoverty is eradicated, leading to a world of justice and \r\ndignity for all. \r\nThe year 2015 is also key for negotiations on climate \r\nchange. Seventeen years after Kyoto, the international \r\ncommunity must be ambitious in fighting that particular \r\nthreat to its sustainable development. It is imperative \r\nthat at the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nParis in December, we reach a lasting agreement that is \r\nglobal, fair and binding for all. \r\nClosely related to climate change, the issue of the \r\noceans holds a crucial importance for Portugal in the \r\nlight of its history, its geography and its identity. In June, \r\nmy country organized an international event on the \r\nuse of the oceans, Blue Week, which brought together \r\nmore than 70 countries and international institutions. \r\nIt offered an occasion for open debate and strategic \r\nreflection on the challenges of global management of \r\nthe oceans and the responsible use of their potential. \r\nWe continue to take a strong interest in deepening \r\nthe multilateral dialogue on the sustainability of the \r\noceans and enhancing the overall efforts of the United \r\nNations. Portugal had the honour to co-chair the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group of the Whole on the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of \r\nthe Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic \r\nAspects in setting up a reliable and detailed system of \r\ninformation on the marine environment. The issuance \r\nof the first global integrated marine assessment (see \r\nA/70/112) is a step in the right direction. Members can \r\nrely on the engagement of Portugal in the preparation \r\nof a legally binding instrument on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biodiversity in areas that go \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. \r\nPortugal’s course of action has been geared towards \r\nthe defence of the universal and individual nature of all \r\nhuman rights — not only civil and political rights but \r\nalso economic, social and cultural rights. Combating \r\nviolence against women is a clear priority in that \r\ncontext. I draw attention to the alarming number of \r\ncases of domestic violence that span the most diverse \r\nsocieties and social strata, which cannot continue \r\nto go unpunished. I invite all States to step up their \r\nefforts to put an end to that scourge, and I hope that \r\nthe relative indicator will be taken into account in the \r\noverall assessment of compliance with the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. I also stress the importance that \r\nwe attach to children’s rights, including the right to \r\neducation and to youth policies.\r\nAt a time when we are witnessing the proliferation \r\nof violent clashes in a number of regions, it must be \r\nemphasized that no conflict, no matter how complex \r\nit may be, can possibly justify barbarism, whether \r\nby States or by non-State parties. Human rights are \r\nthe common heritage of humankind that we all have \r\n52/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nan obligation to defend, regardless of geography. The \r\nSecurity Council plays a key role in that context. In \r\norder to fulfil its mandate in the most effective manner, \r\nit should mirror the realities of our world. That will \r\nrequire extending membership in both categories and \r\nreviewing its working methods. \r\nThe tragic humanitarian situation in Syria, Iraq, \r\nLibya and many other conflict settings should prompt \r\nus to act in a supportive and responsible manner. Some \r\nof those crises, particularly in Syria, have already \r\nclaimed many thousands of human lives and given \r\nrise to one of the largest f lows of refugees since the \r\nSecond World War. The resolution of those crises can \r\nno longer remain hostage to blockages that prolong and \r\naggravate the misery and suffering of vast populations. \r\nIn line with its consistently humanitarian tradition, \r\nPortugal has demonstrated dedicated solidarity from \r\nthe very beginning, as demonstrated by its willingness \r\nto welcome several thousand people in need of \r\ninternational protection. \r\nI take this opportunity to commend the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\nwhich has epitomized the humanitarian values \r\nenshrined in the Charter. The dignity of human life is \r\nan absolute value that we have an obligation to respect \r\nand protect. On the other hand, for some years we have \r\nfound ourselves facing the threat of terrorism, which \r\ncontinues to assume increasingly barbaric and worrying \r\nforms. That threat and its protagonists require strong, \r\nconcerted responses and a determined fight on the \r\npart of the international community. Such responses \r\nshould also address the underlying forces that lead to \r\nradicalization and violent extremism, which require \r\nthe involvement of States, international organizations, \r\nreligious communities and civil society organizations. \r\nI must also express our concern about the deadlock \r\naffecting the peace process in the Middle East. There \r\nwill be no lasting peace without a fair resolution of the \r\nPalestinian issue that also ensures Israel’s security. We \r\nurge the parties to resume the peace talks, as we are \r\nconvinced that the only solution to the conflict will be \r\nthe creation, based on United Nations resolutions, of \r\ntwo States, living side by side in democracy, peace and \r\nsecurity. \r\nI welcome the agreement reached on Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme. It is now up to all parties involved to \r\nensure its full implementation.\r\nAfrica holds a special place in Portuguese foreign \r\npolicy. My country has key partners in Africa, with \r\nwhich it maintains close relations in the most varied \r\nfields, ranging from political dialogue to economic \r\nlinks, from the approach to security issues to the \r\nestablishment of mutually beneficial partnerships. A \r\nnumber of African countries where Portuguese is the \r\nofficial language — Mozambique, Cabo Verde, Sao \r\nTome and Principe and Angola — are celebrating the \r\nfortieth anniversary of their independence this year, \r\nand Portugal and the Portuguese people are involved in \r\nthat important historical event. \r\nThe situation in Guinea-Bissau deserves special \r\nmention. I trust its political leaders to recognize the \r\nessential value of political stability and the ability \r\nto work together in order to pursue the necessary \r\nreforms, including in the security sector, in the fight \r\nagainst impunity and in socioeconomic development \r\nprojects. That would be the required framework for \r\nthe international community to be able to fulfil its \r\ncommitments to cooperation, made in March at the \r\nBrussels Conference. The democratic maturity that the \r\npeople of Guinea-Bissau have demonstrated is sufficient \r\nreason for the international community to remain united \r\nand coordinated in supporting that country. We also \r\nremain engaged on matters concerning maritime safety, \r\nespecially in the Gulf of Guinea. We have participated \r\nin the development of international support strategies \r\nand have strengthened our bilateral cooperation with \r\nthe African States and the regional organizations. \r\nPortugal is strengthening its relations with Latin \r\nAmerican States. We have added a mutual willingness \r\nto know each other better and to deepen our political \r\nand economic relations to our historical and cultural \r\nties. I very much welcome the positive developments \r\nsurrounding the ongoing peace negotiations in \r\nColombia and the normalization of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States of America.\r\nThe Portuguese language is a global, economically \r\nrelevant communication vehicle. Some 250 million \r\npeople from Asia to Europe and from Africa to Latin \r\nAmerica express themselves in Portuguese in their \r\neveryday lives, in commerce and business and in \r\ncultural and social networks. It is also an official \r\nor a working language in several international \r\norganizations, including in some of the United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies. The legitimate ambition of the \r\nCommunity of Portuguese-speaking Countries is to \r\n15-29265 53/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nsee the Portuguese language recognized as an official \r\nlanguage of the United Nations.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations, I reiterate the commitment \r\nexpressed here in 2008. Portugal, 60 years now into \r\nits membership in the United Nations, remains firmly \r\ncommitted to effective multilateralism. It participates \r\nin many peacekeeping operations, has been in the \r\nSecurity Council three times, is currently a member of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and fiercely stands by the \r\nguiding principles of the Charter in its international \r\nactions. In a globalized, interdependent world such \r\nas the one in which we live, only strong multilateral \r\ninstitutions can ensure the fundamental values of peace, \r\nhuman rights, sustainable development, democracy and \r\nrespect for international law.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Portugal for the statement he has just made. \r\nPresident Aníbal António Cavaco Silva, President \r\nof the Republic of Portugal, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr.  Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Prime \r\nMinister of Denmark\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Denmark. \r\nMr. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Prime Minister of \r\nDenmark, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, \r\nPrime Minister of Denmark, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly. \r\nMr. Rasmussen (Denmark): Seventy years ago, \r\nthis Organization was born out of the chaos and ruins \r\nof the Second World War. It was born with the hope \r\nand a vision that the future would be better and more \r\npeaceful than the past. Small and large countries signed \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations; my own country \r\nwas signatory number 50. It was a commitment to \r\nsolving common problems through cooperation and \r\ndialogue. How is today’s world compared to that of our \r\ngrandparents? The answer is simple. Much progress has \r\nbeen made. \r\nWe live in a world that is wealthier. Millions \r\nhave been lifted out of poverty. There is a dramatic \r\nincrease in the number of children — and in particular \r\ngirls — attending schools. We continue to witness \r\nhorrible conflicts in many parts of the world, but the \r\nnumber and magnitude of armed conflicts between \r\nStates have decreased. Our fight against deadly diseases \r\nhas saved millions. This is one side of the coin. We also \r\nlive in a changing world. Conflicts remain the greatest \r\nthreat to human development. The number of refugees \r\nand displaced persons is growing at an alarming speed. \r\nViolent extremism is spreading. Human rights are \r\nbeing violated. Our planet is under stress due to scarce \r\nresources and climate change. That is the other side of \r\nthe coin. \r\nThe world is complex, as it has always been. There \r\nare no simple solutions and there never were. We need \r\nto engage actively and cooperate closely to address \r\nthe challenges today, as we did 70 years ago. From my \r\nperspective, there are three main priorities for the United \r\nNations in the coming years. First, peace and security. \r\nLike many others in my generation, my political view \r\nof the world was shaped by 1989. The wall came down. \r\nThe Iron Curtain disappeared. Today, once again, the \r\nworld faces a situation where cooperation and dialogue \r\nare all too often replaced by force and violence. We \r\nmust ensure that the United Nations can effectively \r\nprovide security in the face of ever more complex crises \r\nand threats. \r\nIn Ukraine, we have seen completely unacceptable \r\nviolations of international law and principles of \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. In Syria, civilians \r\nsuffer from horrific abuses committed by the terrorist \r\norganization, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \r\n(ISIL) and by the Al-Assad regime. The Danish \r\nGovernment continues to support efforts for a political \r\nsolution to the conflict, and we are proud to be a \r\nmember of the international coalition against ISIL. We \r\nneed a strong and unified response to violent extremism \r\nand terrorism, not just in Syria and Iraq, but also in \r\nparts of Africa, where violent extremism and armed \r\nconflicts are growing. Denmark will do its part. We \r\nplan to increase our contribution to the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nMali.\r\nMassive refugee and migration f lows are a visible \r\nconsequence of these conflicts. Almost 60 million \r\npeople are f leeing their homes. We have an international \r\nresponsibility to provide the necessary protection \r\n54/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nfor refugees. Many of them have no food, medicine, \r\nschools for their children or hope for the future. They \r\nneed our support. Denmark takes this responsibility \r\nvery seriously. Last year, we were the second-largest \r\nrecipient of Syrian refugees, per capita, in the European \r\nUnion. \r\nI also welcome the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to strengthen United Nations peace operations, \r\nbut we need more than Blue Helmets to ensure lasting \r\npeace. We need a Security Council that is ready to \r\ntake the necessary decisions to maintain international \r\npeace and security, and effectively address conflicts \r\nin a timely manner and that reflects the world as it \r\nis today. The international community must have the \r\nright instruments to adequately tackle the situation, \r\nand we must keep an open mind when we evaluate the \r\ninstruments we have at hand.\r\nMany people migrate for economic reasons, \r\nin search of a better life, and their hopes are indeed \r\nunderstandable. But mass migration is obviously an \r\nimmense challenge for our societies, our international \r\ncooperation and our solidarity. First and foremost, mass \r\nmigration is a global challenge, and we must address \r\nits root causes. People migrate because they have lost \r\nhope at home. Inclusive economic growth in developing \r\ncountries should be our common goal. There are no \r\neasy solutions.\r\nThe United Nations is an important part of the \r\nanswer. Member States have the primary responsibility \r\nfor development and progress in their own countries. \r\nBut we must all do our part and provide the necessary \r\nfinancial contributions to ensure that they succeed. \r\nDenmark is ready to do its part, as we have done since \r\n1978. We remain committed to the United Nations \r\ntarget of providing development assistance amounting \r\nto 0.7 per cent of our gross domestic product. Denmark \r\nis widely recognized as a leading humanitarian donor, \r\nand we will continue to give the area high priority. \r\nLast week, my Government decided to allocate an \r\nadditional €100 million to humanitarian assistance and \r\nto measures that support European efforts to address \r\nthe mass migration from Syria and its neighbourhood. \r\nI am deeply concerned about the probability that the \r\nhumanitarian needs associated with this will far \r\noutgrow the available financing, and I call on all States \r\nto increase their humanitarian efforts. The international \r\ncommunity must find solutions to this extraordinary \r\nsituation.\r\nThat leads me to our next priority, human rights \r\nand gender equality. The Charter of the United Nations \r\nsays very clearly that the equal and indispensable rights \r\nof all people are the foundation of freedom, justice \r\nand peace in the world. The best way to build a better \r\nworld is to unleash the power of the individual for the \r\nsake of the common good. Today, more people live in \r\ndemocracies than ever before, but the lives of many \r\nare still threatened because of who they are or what \r\nthey believe. Denmark has always pursued an active \r\nhuman rights policy, based on dialogue as the key tool \r\nto progress.\r\nMy Government is a strong advocate of women’s \r\nrights. Women are key drivers in our efforts to ensure \r\nsustainable development and end poverty. Denmark \r\nwill have the honour of hosting the Women Deliver \r\nConference in May of next year, and I hope that many \r\nof those here will join us in Copenhagen. Denmark is \r\nalso engaged in the global fight against torture, and we \r\nare proud to be part of the Convention against Torture \r\nInitiative, whose goal is universal ratification and better \r\nimplementation of the Convention by 2024. We call on \r\nall States to join with us in working for that goal.\r\nTo put it clearly, Denmark is entirely committed to \r\nupholding the core values of the United Nations. That \r\nis why we have decided to run for a seat on the Human \r\nRights Council for the period from 2019 to 2021. \r\nOur candidacy enjoys the support of all the Nordic \r\ncountries, and I hope all here today will find us worthy \r\nof their vote. I can assure them that we will aspire to be \r\na strong partner for all in advancing human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nThe third and final major challenge for the United \r\nNations is implementing the development agenda and \r\neffectively addressing climate change. This weekend, \r\nI had the privilege and honour of co-chairing the \r\nSustainable Development Summit. We have adopted \r\nthe new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), and now we need to act, through \r\nnational policies and by supporting the countries that \r\nneed the most help. The Sustainable Development Goals \r\ncarry a multi-trillion-dollar price tag, and that cannot \r\nbe met by Governments or aid alone. We need the \r\nsupport of all actors — private enterprises, civil society, \r\nnon-governmental and international organizations and \r\nmany others. We must find new and innovative ways of \r\nengaging these actors if we are serious about delivering \r\non the development agenda.\r\n15-29265 55/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nThat is particularly true when it comes to \r\naddressing climate change. To give a small example, \r\nDenmark has established a climate investment fund to \r\npromote private investments in developing countries \r\nand emerging markets. Danish pension savings now \r\ncontribute to financing Africa’s largest wind farm, in \r\nLake Turkana in Kenya. We need more such solutions if \r\nwe are to deliver on the development agenda and reach \r\nan ambitious, binding climate agreement in Paris later \r\nthis year.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe need for an effective United Nations has never \r\nbeen greater. If we fail to deal with the enormous tasks \r\nfacing us, there is a risk that we will undermine the key \r\nvalues and principles of the Charter. Throughout the \r\nhistory of the United Nations, Denmark has been one \r\nof the strongest supporters of our world Organization, \r\nand that will not change. I am honoured that a Dane \r\nhas assumed the presidency of the General Assembly, \r\nand my Government is fully committed to supporting \r\nMr. Lykketoft in his important work.\r\nSeventy years ago our grandparents had a bold vision. \r\nThey believed it was possible to create a better future \r\nfor the peoples of the world. The achievements during \r\nthose 70 years have been remarkable. This anniversary \r\nis a historic opportunity to set ambitious goals for the \r\nfuture. We have agreed on a new development agenda. \r\nNow we must act to show our grandchildren that we are \r\nable to deliver on our promises today, tomorrow and \r\n70 years from now.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Denmark for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lars Løkke Rasmussen, Prime Minister of \r\nDenmark, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nEthiopia, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Desalegn (Ethiopia): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Mr. President, on your assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at this \r\nimportant juncture in the history of the United Nations. \r\nThis has indeed been a seminal year. Not only is it \r\none in which we are commemorating the seventieth \r\nanniversary of our only universal Organization, it has \r\nalso been a year when bold actions have been taken for \r\nthe sake of our people and planet. \r\nI would also like to express my profound \r\nappreciation to your predecessor, our brother from \r\nAfrica, who successfully steered the work of this \r\nbody for the past year, a period that witnessed some \r\ndifficult intergovernmental negotiation processes. \r\nHis contribution to facilitating those processes and \r\nadvancing the agenda of the United Nations was indeed \r\nsignificant, and we owe him a debt of gratitude for his \r\ntireless efforts. I would also like to pay special tribute \r\nto the Secretary-General for his dedication and tireless \r\nefforts to realize the aims and purposes of the United \r\nNations.\r\nWhat we have achieved so far this year through \r\ndifficult negotiations and compromise, by adopting a \r\ncompact for global partnership within the framework of \r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda in July, as well as the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) at the historic Summit we have just concluded, \r\nhas made it evident that we are indeed potentially at a \r\nwatershed moment in the history of the United Nations. \r\nWe are confident that the same collective resolve will \r\nbe demonstrated by Member States as we take up the \r\nchallenge of an equally transformative change in United \r\nNations peace operations.\r\nThe political will and commitment that we have \r\ndemonstrated in adopting the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda and the 2030 Agenda give us hope and optimism \r\nthat we can secure a new globally binding climate \r\nagreement in Paris in December under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. In that regard, Mr. President, I would like to \r\nassure you of my delegation’s full support in helping \r\nyou to discharge your heavy responsibilities during this \r\nmomentous and historic year.\r\n56/57 15-29265\r\nA/70/PV.13 28/09/2015\r\nEthiopia is indeed proud to be one of the founding \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Although in our hour \r\nof need we could not count much on the support of the \r\nLeague of Nations, of which we were also a member, \r\nEthiopia has nonetheless never lost confidence in \r\nmultilateralism and has remained a staunch supporter \r\nof the principle of collective security enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. It is on the basis of that \r\nconviction that Ethiopia has been an active contributor \r\nto advancing the principles and purposes of the United \r\nNations, including by deploying its forces as part of \r\nthe Blue Helmets since the Organization’s early days. \r\nIt gives us great satisfaction to note that Ethiopia is \r\nnow the second-largest contributor of troops to United \r\nNations peacekeeping, and I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reaffirm our unwavering commitment \r\nto playing an active role in helping to ensure that the \r\nUnited Nations becomes more effective and secures \r\ngreater legitimacy.\r\nAs we mark the seventieth anniversary of our \r\nOrganization, it is only fitting that we take stock of the \r\nachievements and challenges of the past seven decades \r\nand draw appropriate lessons from history as we move \r\nforward. That the world has made tremendous progress \r\nin a wide range of areas by advancing the noble \r\nobjectives enshrined in the Charter is not in doubt. The \r\nOrganization has done commendable work to foster \r\ninternational cooperation for development, promote \r\nrespect for human rights and address humanitarian \r\nproblems. Nonetheless, what has been achieved so \r\nfar is a far cry from the Herculean challenges we \r\nface today. Nor can we overlook our many failures as \r\nan Organization, something that, as has been so ably \r\nestablished by the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations, is very apparent in the area of peace \r\nand security, as well as with regard to the creation of a \r\nlevel playing field in international economic and trade \r\nrelations.\r\nDespite all this, however, one thing is self-evident. \r\nThe United Nations is an Organization that none of us \r\ncan afford to live without. In spite of its shortcomings, \r\nit remains the only universal Organization we have, \r\nwhether we are big or small, rich or poor, providing \r\nus with a unique platform for advancing our common \r\nobjectives and addressing the myriad problems we \r\ncollectively face. The challenge that we have to address \r\nat this juncture in the history of the Organization is \r\nmore or less obvious. It has to do with how we can \r\nmake it relevant and effective as we collectively strive \r\nto meet the needs and aspirations of our people in \r\nthe twenty-first century. That, I believe, is the main \r\nessence of the anniversary celebration aptly captured in \r\nthe slogan “Strong UN. Better World”. But the United \r\nNations is, after all, an intergovernmental Organization \r\nwhose strengths and weaknesses cannot be understood \r\nindependently of the role of its members. It is therefore \r\nup to us to empower the Organization to fulfil its \r\npromises in a new era.\r\nThe United Nations is indeed a creation of the \r\npost-1945 world order and the devastating experiences \r\nof the Second World War and the Great Depression \r\nthat preceded it, and that unquestionably inspired the \r\nletter and spirit of the Charter. The world has changed \r\ntremendously since then, however, and the complex and \r\nmultifaceted challenges we face today — in particular, \r\nobviously, the threat of terrorism and violent extremism, \r\nthe devastating consequences of climate change and \r\nother emerging challenges of our time — are quite \r\ndifferent from those that the founders had to deal with \r\nin the immediate aftermath of the war. At the same \r\ntime, not only has the membership of the United Nations \r\nchanged dramatically over the years, but so have the \r\ngeopolitical and economic realities of our planet. Today, \r\nwith rapid globalization and a dramatic revolution in \r\ninformation technology, we are living in a much more \r\ninterconnected and interdependent world. That is why \r\nthe United Nations needs the tools necessary to deal \r\nwith those challenges and realities so that it can better \r\nserve the needs of our peoples and nations in a new and \r\ncompletely different era.\r\nThe need for reform of the United Nations system \r\nhas long been recognized, but forging the necessary \r\ncompromise among the wider membership has not been \r\neasy. However, it can be delayed no longer. It is clear \r\nthat if we do not undertake the necessary reforms, we \r\nwill not be able to deliver the transformative agenda \r\nwe have set for ourselves. That is the reason why it is \r\nnot enough to adopt the next generation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, whose ambition and transformative \r\naspirations make them truly historic. \r\nIt is also vital that the United Nations be made \r\nfit for the post-2015 era. A comprehensive reform of \r\nthe United Nations system, particularly the Security \r\nCouncil, is indeed imperative if we are to reflect current \r\ngeopolitical realities and make the United Nations more \r\nbroadly representative, legitimate and effective. In that \r\ncontext, it is only proper that we seize this opportunity \r\nto once again echo Africa’s call to be fully represented \r\nin all the decision-making organs of the United Nations, \r\n15-29265 57/57\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.13\r\nparticularly the Security Council, as expressed in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\r\nWe in Ethiopia remain fully committed to the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations. We \r\nare very grateful for the support and partnership of \r\nthe United Nations in our development endeavours. \r\nThe reason for the remarkable progress that we have \r\nmade over the past 15 years, including achieving all of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, is to be found in \r\nthe fact that we have taken charge of our own destiny, \r\ndevised our own development strategy and mobilized \r\ndomestic resources for their implementation. But \r\nwe have also made the best use of the development \r\ncooperation we have had with the United Nations and \r\nour other partners.\r\nEthiopia has embarked on an ambitious transformative \r\nagenda, with a view to achieving middle-income \r\nstatus by the year 2025. We intend to do so based on \r\ncarbon-neutral growth through a climate-resilient \r\n“green economy” strategy that is fully integrated into \r\nour national development plan. The results achieved \r\nover the past five years are quite encouraging, and have \r\ninspired us to do even more by implementing a second \r\ngrowth and transformation agenda that we will embark \r\non soon. We therefore look at the possibilities that lie \r\nahead with great optimism, the more so because we \r\nalso trust that we are all determined to adhere to the \r\ncommitment we entered into at the Summit concluded \r\nyesterday. \r\nIt is with that deep sense of optimism that I want \r\nto conclude by once again reiterating my country’s \r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations, as well as to continuing to play an active and \r\nconstructive role in realizing its noble objectives.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4 p.m.\r\n"
