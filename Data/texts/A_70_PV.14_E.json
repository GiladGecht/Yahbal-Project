We are confident that you will lead the \r\nAssembly effectively and successfully. I would also \r\nlike to express our gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa for his leadership of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. I also pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\npersonal dedication and commitment to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe theme for this session, “The United Nations \r\nat 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human \r\nrights”, is a very pertinent one. In the book of Matthew, \r\nChapter 22, verses 37-38, the Bile tell us to “Love God \r\nwith all your heart” and “Love your neighbour as you \r\nlove yourself”. Yesterday, while chairing the United \r\nNations Summit on the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), I quoted that portion of the Bible. Given the \r\nfact that the United Nations has been in existence for \r\nthe past 70 years, one would have imagined that those \r\nfundamental rules of Christianity, which are also found \r\nin other religions, would have been clear to every \r\nmember of the human family. Yet, unfortunately, that \r\nhas not been the case.\r\nUntil recently, the human race has been divided \r\nbetween a small group of aff luent and prosperous \r\nsocieties on the one hand and a large number \r\nof underdeveloped societies on the other. The \r\nunderdeveloped societies have been in that condition \r\npartly because of endogenous factors and also partly \r\nbecause of exogenous factors. We do not have the time \r\nto lay out those two sets of factors that were responsible \r\nfor that dichotomy in the human race between the \r\ndeveloped and underdeveloped societies on the same \r\nplanet in the same age.\r\nYet, as if by a miracle, during the sixty-ninth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, the Member States \r\nfinally agreed on the all-important SDGs — 17 of them. \r\nThe convergence of analysis and solutions, of diagnosis \r\nand prescription, is a landmark in the history of \r\nhumankind. It means that the international community \r\nnow agrees with us in Uganda, we who have for long \r\nidentified 10 strategic bottlenecks that have held Africa \r\nback from undergoing the necessary transformation to \r\nbecome first-world societies.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.14\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n14th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 28 September 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nUnlike past prescriptions that entailed mainly \r\nphilanthropy and aid and spoke of social goals without \r\ntalking of economic goals, and so forth, the SDGs that \r\nwe adopted the other day (see resolution 70/1) talk about \r\nindustrialization and added value, trade, investments \r\nand human-resource development in addition to the \r\npreviously proposed remedies. Above all, the SDGs \r\nproclaim in bold letters the concept of universal \r\nprosperity for all societies, for the first time in human \r\nhistory. While it is amazing that such enlightened self-\r\ninterest has taken so long to dawn on all of us, the old \r\nsaying that “better late than never” appropriately comes \r\nto mind in this case.\r\nThis convergence of diagnosis and prescription \r\nregarding global issues will, above all, assist in \r\nprioritizing the use of scarce resources, especially \r\nthose under the control of international agencies. The \r\ntug-of-war as to what is more important, electricity or \r\neducation, now comes to an end. It is clear that both, \r\nand more, are the sine qua non of socioeconomic \r\ntransformation. Moreover, the use of the word \r\n“transformation” in the SDGs is most revealing. That is \r\nwhat we have been urging our partners to adopt instead \r\nof vague phrases like “sustainable development”.\r\nSustainable development without the resultant \r\ntransformation is like talking of quantitative growth \r\nwithout qualitative change. We have been pointing out \r\nthat that is not what happens in nature. The healthy \r\nquantitative expansion of, for instance, a foetus in the \r\nwomb of the mother should always result, after a due \r\nperiod of time, into the foetus metamorphosing into \r\na baby who now breathes through the nose and feeds \r\nthrough the mouth instead of relying on the umbilical \r\ncord.\r\nSimilarly, societies must grow not only \r\nquantitatively but also qualitatively. African societies, \r\nfor instance, must grow from the pre-capitalist modes of \r\nproduction and from being producers of raw materials \r\nto middle-class and skilled working-class societies. I \r\nsalute our own Honourable Sam Kutesa, who played a \r\nleading role in that historic effort at the level of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nOn the issue of global peace, our experience in \r\nUganda has been to go back to the Bible, which teaches \r\nthat whatever a man sows, that is what he reaps. If \r\nyou sow the pseudo-ideology of sectarianism, bad \r\ngovernance, corruption, f lunkeyism, and so forth, you \r\nwill harvest insecurity and the stunted growth of the \r\nState pillars, including the armed forces. Uganda is a \r\ncountry that has had a lot of problems, including losing \r\n800,000 people between 1966 and 1986, who were \r\nkilled extrajudicially by the various regimes.\r\nWe have never, however, appealed for external help \r\nin dealing with the security problems of our country. \r\nWe have always emphasized building our own capacity \r\nat the earliest opportunity. That has served us well. \r\nUganda today has capable security forces that have \r\nushered in peace throughout the whole country, for the \r\nfirst time in the past 500 years.\r\nOur advice to the United Nations system is \r\ntherefore that, while it may be unavoidable to rely \r\non external armies in dealing with particularly ugly \r\nsituations, one should be wary of groups that seek \r\nexternal sponsorship instead of relying on their own \r\ninternal energies and groups that seek to be puppets of \r\nexternal actors. Some very limited external solidarity \r\nmay be necessary when oppressed people are fighting \r\nfor survival and emancipation, if you are dealing with \r\nauthentic patriotic groups.\r\nHowever, the United Nations system will not \r\nadd any value if it is lured into situations where it is \r\nsupporting puppets who have no legitimacy in the \r\nvarious respective situations or who are pursuing one \r\npseudo-ideology or another. In that case the United \r\nNations becomes part of the problem, not part of the \r\nsolution.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Uganda \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of \r\n15-29271 3/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nthe Republic of Chile, and to invite her to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): \r\nToday’s world is faced with both challenges and tasks. \r\nWe are witnessing a plethora of serious international \r\ncrises in various parts of the world, crises that have \r\nimpacted international peace and security, most notably \r\nin the Middle East, but also in Europe and Africa. \r\nThose crises affect, in particular, huge segments of the \r\ncivilian populations, who, in desperation, are f leeing in \r\norder to save their lives and forge a better future.\r\nAs an international community, we are dutybound \r\nto react with solidarity to restore peace and deploy a \r\nresponse that will enable us to minimize the suffering \r\nof both the victims of war and those who are f leeing \r\nfrom war. We commend the efforts that many countries \r\nare making to take in the refugees, but we must do \r\nmore. That is why my Government has decided to take \r\nin refugees from the civil war in Syria, and it is also \r\nwhy Chile will expand cooperation with Africa. As of \r\n2016, for example, we will be participating in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in that region.\r\nIn addition to facint the most urgent challenges \r\nthreatening peace, our planet has yet to stem growing \r\ninequality or reach an agreement that would halt global \r\nwarming. It is for that reason, against the backdrop \r\nof such serious international challenges, that this \r\nseventieth session of the General Assembly will go \r\ndown in history as a momentous occasion on which \r\nthe international community succeeded in forging an \r\nagreement, namely, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). That Agenda is replete \r\nwith hope and is binding in nature. It focuses on \r\naddressing various aspects of inequality, which is the \r\nmain challenge to be found in Latin America, and of \r\ncourse, it goes without saying, in Chile as well.\r\nIn this new phase of our economic and political \r\ndevelopment the new Agenda is broad and ambitious \r\nand is commensurate with the pressing challenges and \r\nlong-term goals of fair, creative and peaceful human \r\ncoexistence. It does not sweep aside the commitments \r\nthat have already been entered into whose fulfilment \r\nis still pending, but rather incorporates new goals and \r\ntargets, integrating them multidimensionally into the \r\nconcept of sustainable and inclusive development. It is, \r\nin other words, an Agenda of change.\r\nThat is an approach that we share and vigorously \r\nsupport — equality within and among countries, equality \r\nbetween men and women, growth, industrialization and \r\ninclusive and sustainable consumption, the protection \r\nof the environment in its various facets, and social \r\npeace, to name but a few of the Agenda’s Goals. They \r\nare the face and indeed the foundation of a mode of \r\ncoexistence based on very deeply held values.\r\nWe have an opportunity to address the feelings of \r\ndespair and hopelessness about the future and the lack of \r\ntrust in institutions that permeate some of our societies. \r\nThe chief responsibility for sustainable and more equal \r\ndevelopment rests with each individual country. Chile \r\nis wholeheartedly committed to delivering on that \r\nresponsibility. However, success in that endeavour \r\nrequires a propitious environment, since many of the \r\ntargets are affected by global dynamics and most of the \r\nchallenges that we face today cannot be resolved by any \r\nsingle country acting in isolation.\r\nOnly if we can deliver on an agenda of change at the \r\nglobal as well as the national levels will it be possible to \r\npromote more inclusive and sustainable societies. When \r\ninternational trade does not act as an engine of growth, \r\nwhen financial f lows are asymmetrical, minimal and \r\nvolatile, if there are no fair and effective mechanisms \r\nfor dealing with sovereign debt, if there are not enough \r\npredictable f lows of official development assistance, \r\nthen emerging countries, especially the poorer ones, \r\nwill have great difficulty in attaining the Goals \r\ncontained in the 2030 Agenda.\r\nSimilarly, it is clear that international financial, \r\nmonetary and trading systems must operate more \r\ndemocratically, effectively and fairly in relation to the \r\ninterests of developing countries. That is not always the \r\ncase at present. Consequently, a basic prerequisite for \r\nmaking the Agenda a reality is to strengthen the system \r\nof global institutions and multilateral cooperation with \r\nbroad representation, clear mandates and effective \r\ntools. We are calling for an architecture of multilateral \r\ninstitutions that will provide backing for the national \r\npolicies proposed under the 2030 Agenda.\r\nChile has strengthened the role it plays in the \r\nmultilateral system. In 2014 and 2015 we have served \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council. \r\nIn the light of that experience we wish to reaffirm our \r\nbelief in the need to reform the Council by increasing \r\nthe number of its permanent members and by reducing \r\nthe use of the veto, at the very least in cases involving \r\ncrimes against humanity. Such a reform is necessary, \r\nreflecting the considerable change and progress seen \r\n4/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nin the multilateral system, and it would undoubtedly \r\nconfer greater legitimacy on that most important organ \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe as a country are aware that we are all \r\nresponsible for ensuring that the international system \r\nworks properly. One essential element for bringing that \r\nabout is the principle of adherence to international law, \r\nwhich includes strict respect for treaties, as a means \r\nof guaranteeing peace and international stability. \r\nThat requires respecting what has been agreed on and \r\nrefraining from misusing the mechanisms that have \r\nbeen designed for peacefully resolving any differences \r\nthat may exist.\r\nFrom its home at the southern tip of the American \r\ncontinent, Chile is looking forward, full of hope, to \r\nthe outcome of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference in \r\nDecember. We have one of the longest coastlines in the \r\nworld. We will soon be hosting the second Our Ocean \r\nConference, at which countries will be asked to make \r\nvoluntary commitments to reducing pollution of the \r\nseas, combat illegal fishing and protect the diversity of \r\nmarine resources.\r\nAs for its intended nationally determined \r\ncontribution, my country committed to reducing its \r\nCO² emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, compared with \r\n2007, and by up to 45 per cent if we can count on robust \r\ninternational support. Moreover, we are determined \r\nto restore 100,000 acres of forest and to reforest an \r\nadditional 100,000 acres of land. \r\nAgenda 2030 gives us a shared horizon, a shared \r\ndestination. Now we must act. Each country must \r\nact individually, of course, but at the same time we \r\nmust cooperate with each other in the various North-\r\nSouth and South-South forums and must tackle global \r\nchallenges jointly in the multilateral forums that we \r\nhave available to us.\r\nI should like to conclude this statement by \r\ncongratulating two Governments of our region that have \r\nresumed diplomatic relations recently, namely, Cuba \r\nand the United States of America. That is an historic \r\nstep for our region and for the world. Chile applauds the \r\nuse of dialogue and respect for international law as the \r\ncivilized way for countries to resolve their differences.\r\nI should also like to say that we are extraordinarily \r\npleased to see that there have been numerous other \r\nagreements reached as well, for instance between the \r\nGovernment of Colombia and the Revolutionary Armed \r\nForces of Colombia. We believe that is also proof that \r\nwhere there is a will, there is a way to come to an \r\nagreement. Colombia and its people can count on our \r\nactive support in that process, which we are confident \r\nwill lead to a lasting peace.\r\nWe have reason to be proud of our joint achievements \r\nand also, let it be said, to be concerned about and \r\nattentive to our collective future. But there are grounds \r\nfor hope as well. Those beliefs should guide our action \r\nand our commitment to build a better world, a world \r\nin which there is better balance between development \r\nand the preservation of our environment, a world in \r\nwhich we see more justice, cohesion and equality in our \r\nsocieties and among our peoples.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Chile \r\nfor the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Raúl Castro Ruz, President of \r\nthe Councils of State and Ministers of the Republic \r\nof Cuba\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Councils of State and \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Raúl Castro Ruz, President of the Councils of \r\nState and Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Raúl Castro Ruz, President of the \r\nCouncils of State and Ministers of the Republic of \r\nCuba, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Castro Ruz (spoke in Spanish): It was \r\n70 years ago that, on behalf on their peoples, the first \r\nMember States of the Organization signed the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. We pledged ourselves to preserve \r\nfuture generations from the scourge of war and to build \r\na new type of relationship, guided by a set of purposes \r\nand principles that sought to bring about an era of \r\npeace, justice and development for all of humanity.\r\nHowever, from that moment there have constantly \r\nbeen wars of aggression and interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States, the ousting of sovereign Governments \r\n15-29271 5/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nby force, so-called soft coups and the recolonization of \r\nterritories — all perfected by unconventional ways of \r\nacting, using new technologies and under the pretext \r\nof alleged human rights violations. The militarization \r\nof cyberspace and the covert and illegal use of \r\ninformation and communication technologies to attack \r\nother States are unacceptable, as is the distortion of the \r\nadvancement and protection of human rights when used \r\nin a selective and discriminatory approach to validate \r\nand impose political decisions.\r\nDespite the fact that the Charter calls on us to \r\nreaffirm faith in fundamental human rights and the \r\ndignity and worth of the human person, for millions of \r\npeople the fulfilment of human rights remains a utopia. \r\nHumankind has been denied the right to live in peace \r\nand the right to development. It is actually in poverty \r\nand inequality that the cause of conflicts should be \r\nsought — conflicts that were earlier generated by \r\ncolonialism and the plundering of regional peoples, and \r\nlater by imperialism and the distribution of spheres of \r\ninfluence.\r\nThe commitment made in 1945 to promoting social \r\nprogress and better standards of living for the peoples, \r\nalong with their economic and social development, \r\nremains an illusion when 795 million people go hungry, \r\nwhen 781 million adults are illiterate, and when 17,000 \r\nchildren perish every day from curable diseases. In the \r\nmeantime, annual military expenditures worldwide \r\namount to more than $1.7 trillion. Barely a fraction \r\nof that figure could actually resolve the most pressing \r\nproblems aff licting humankind. Even in industrial \r\nnations, the welfare society, which was presented as \r\nthe model to imitate, has practically disappeared. The \r\nelection systems and the traditional parties, which \r\nrely on money and publicity, are growing increasingly \r\ndetached and distant from the aspirations of their \r\npeoples.\r\nClimate change is threatening the very existence \r\nof the human species. States should assume common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities, in view of the \r\nindisputable reality that not all countries are equally \r\naccountable for what has happened. Not all of us \r\nwaste natural and human resources through irrational \r\nand unsustainable consumerism. The consequences \r\nof climate change are particularly for small island \r\ndeveloping States and additional tensions to their \r\nfragile economies. The same is happening in Africa \r\nwith the relentless advance of desertification. \r\nWe stand in solidarity with our Caribbean \r\nbrothers and demand that they be treated in a special \r\nand differentiated way. We also support the African \r\ncountries and demand fair treatment for them, as well \r\nas the transfer of technology and financial resources.\r\nWith the establishment of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), and \r\nespecially the signing by the CELAC Heads of State \r\nand Government in January 2014 of the Proclamation \r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, \r\nwe have shown that we can move beyond our differences \r\ntoward unity and the achievement of common goals in \r\nthe framework of our diversity.\r\nIn the Proclamation we reaffirm our steadfast \r\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and in international law to settle \r\ndisputes by peaceful means and our belief that full \r\nrespect for the inalienable right of each State to choose \r\nits political, economic, social and cultural system is an \r\nessential condition for ensuring peaceful coexistence \r\namong nations. We demand that those principles be the \r\nbasis for relations with other States in our region. \r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela can always \r\nrely on the solidarity of Cuba vis-à-vis the attempts at \r\ndestabilization and subversion of its constitutional order \r\nand the destruction of the work begun  by Comrade \r\nHugo Chávez Frías and pursued by President Nicolás \r\nMaduro Moros for the benefit of the Venezuelan people. \r\nLikewise, our firm and unlimited solidarity goes to \r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, its citizens’ revolution and \r\nits leader Rafael Correa Delgado, who has become the \r\ntarget of the same destabilization script applied against \r\nother progressive Governments in the region.\r\nWe stand in solidarity with the Caribbean nations \r\ndemanding fair reparation for the horrors of slavery \r\nand the slave trade, above all in a world where racial \r\ndiscrimination and repression of communities of people \r\nof African descent have increased. We also reaffirm \r\nour conviction that the people of Puerto Rico deserve \r\nto be free and independent after more than a century \r\nof colonial domination. We stand in solidarity with \r\nthe Argentine Republic in its fair claim of sovereignty \r\nover the Malvinas Islands, South Georgia and South \r\nSandwich islands.\r\nWe reiterate our support for and solidarity with \r\nPresident Dilma Rousseff and the Brazilian people \r\nin defence of their major social achievements and the \r\nstability of their country. \r\n6/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nWe reaffirm our rejection of the intention to expand \r\nthe presence of NATO up to the Russian borders, as \r\nwell as the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed on \r\nthat nation.\r\nWe welcome the so-called nuclear agreement \r\nwith the Islamic Republic of Iran, which proves that \r\nengagement and negotiations are the only effective \r\ntools for settling disputes between States. We renew \r\nour confidence that the Syrian people are capable of \r\nsolving their disputes by themselves and demand an \r\nend to external interference in that country.\r\nA fair and lasting solution of the Middle East \r\nconflict unquestionably requires the true exercise \r\nby the Palestinian people of their inalienable right to \r\nbuild their own State within the borders existing prior \r\nto 1967, with its capital in East Jerusalem, which we \r\nstrongly support.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nOver the past few weeks, we have been moved by \r\nthe images of waves of migration toward Europe. That \r\nis a direct result of the destabilizing actions promoted \r\nand executed by NATO in countries of the Middle \r\nEast and North Africa, as well as of the poverty and \r\nunderdevelopment prevailing in the countries of the \r\nAfrican continent. The European Union should take \r\nfull and immediate responsibility for the human crisis \r\nthat it helped to generate.\r\nAfter 56 years, during which the Cuban people put \r\nup heroic and self less resistance, diplomatic relations \r\nhave been re-established between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America. Now, a long and complex process \r\nbegins towards the normalization of relations. But that \r\nwill be achieved only with the end of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade against Cuba, the \r\nreturn to our country of the territory illegally occupied \r\nby the Guantanamo naval base, and the cessation of \r\nradio and television broadcasts and of subversive and \r\ndestabilizing programmes against the island. Our \r\npeople should also be compensated for the human and \r\neconomic damage that they still endure. \r\nWhile the blockade remains in force, we shall \r\ncontinue introducing the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. To all the 188 Governments \r\nand peoples that have sponsored our just demand here \r\nand in other international regional forums, we reiterate \r\nthe eternal appreciation of the Cuban people and \r\nGovernment for their continued support.\r\nCuba is celebrating with profound commitment \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nDespite the efforts that have been made throughout \r\nthose years, not enough has been done to save present \r\nand future generations from the scourge of war and to \r\nprotect their right to sustainable development without \r\nexclusions. The United Nations should be defended \r\nfrom unilateralism and should be deeply reformed to \r\ndemocratize it and bring it closer to the peoples. \r\nAs Comrade Fidel Castro Ruz, the historic leader \r\nof the Cuban revolution, stated in this same Hall 15 \r\nyears ago\r\n“Everyone understands that the United Nations \r\nbasic role in the new century now upon us is to \r\nsave the world not only from war but also from \r\nunderdevelopment, hunger, diseases, poverty \r\nand the destruction of the natural resources \r\nindispensable to human life. And the United \r\nNations must do this promptly — before it is too \r\nlate.” (A/55/PV.4, p. 20)\r\nThe international community can always depend \r\non Cuba to raise its honest voice against injustice, \r\ninequality, underdevelopment, discrimination and \r\nmanipulation and for the establishment of a more \r\nequitable and fair international order that really focuses \r\non the human being, his dignity and well-being.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Councils of State and Ministers of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Raứl Castro Ruz, President of the Councils of \r\nState and Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of South Africa.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\n15-29271 7/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Jacob Zuma, \r\nPresident of the Republic of South Africa, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Zuma: I should like to congratulate the \r\nPresident and his country, Denmark, on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. He has South Africa’s full support for his \r\npresidency. The theme that he has chosen, “The United \r\nNations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and \r\nhuman rights”, is timely and relevant to the current \r\nglobal challenges facing the world today.\r\nFurthermore, allow me to convey our gratitude to \r\nthe President of the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa of the Republic of Uganda, for the \r\noutstanding manner in which he represented Africa at \r\nthe helm of the General Assembly during that session.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nmarks a significant moment in the history of global \r\ngovernance. The Charter embodies, through its \r\nprinciples and objectives, the aspirations of oppressed \r\npeople worldwide. We would also like to acknowledge \r\nthe role of the United Nations General Assembly over \r\nthe past 70 years. Rooted in the principle of sovereign \r\nequality, the Assembly is the most representative \r\ninternational institution and organ of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe General Assembly has over the years remained \r\ncentral to the provision of support to the disadvantaged, \r\nmarginalized, occupied, colonized and oppressed \r\npeoples of the world. This body elevated the South \r\nAfrican struggle for liberation internationally when it \r\ndeclared apartheid a crime against humanity.\r\nMr. Oliver Tambo, the former President of our \r\nliberation movement, the African National Congress, \r\naddressed the General Assembly from this very \r\npodium on 26 October 1976 (see A/31/PV.41) and spoke \r\nfrom other United Nations platforms as well on other \r\noccasions. Many other eminent South Africans were \r\nprovided an opportunity in various United Nations \r\nforums to state our case for freedom, the United Nations \r\nproviding a voice to the voiceless. A free South Africa \r\nhas also been honoured by the declaration of 18 July \r\nas International Mandela Day, honouring our founding \r\nPresident and world icon, President Nelson Mandela. \r\nAt this celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations I wish to extend, on behalf of the people \r\nof South Africa, our sincere gratitude to the world for \r\nits contribution to our freedom from the shackles of \r\napartheid and institutionalized racism.\r\nThe General Assembly continues to provide a voice \r\nfor the voiceless and the oppressed. In an historic and \r\nlandmark development the General Assembly approved \r\na resolution to allow the Palestinian f lag to f ly in front \r\nof United Nations Headquarters (resolution 69/320). \r\nThe resolution was passed by an overwhelming margin, \r\nsupported by many nations from both the developed \r\nNorth and the developing South. There can be no peace, \r\nsecurity and development in the Middle East without \r\na resolution of the Palestinian question. A solution is \r\nurgent. Otherwise, if we delay, in the next decade we \r\nmay no longer have a piece of land to justify the two-\r\nState solution.\r\nThe historic seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations presents an opportunity to reflect \r\non the structure and workings of the Organization. \r\nSignificantly, this year marks the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the World Summit Outcome (resolution \r\n60/1) in 2005, which discussed reform of the United \r\nNations.\r\nA number of significant decisions on reform have \r\nbeen successfully implemented since that Summit. \r\nThey include the following: the replacement of the \r\nHuman Rights Commission with a more effective \r\nHuman Rights Council, the establishment of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission as a subsidiary body of \r\nboth the General Assembly and the Security Council, \r\nthe reform and streamlining of the United Nations \r\nmanagement system, the mainstreaming of gender \r\nequality through the establishment of the United Nations \r\nEntity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of \r\nWomen (UN-Women),and the membership-driven \r\nresponsibility to protect and to assist populations facing \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and \r\nethnic cleansing. We welcome that notable progress.\r\nHowever, almost no progress has been made on \r\nthe commitment also made by Heads of State and \r\nGovernment in 2005 to the early reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. It is unacceptable and unjustifiable that more \r\nthan 1 billion people in the African continent are still \r\nexcluded from permanent membership in the key \r\ndecision-making structure of the United Nations, the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nA continent with a smaller population than Africa \r\nis represented by three countries on the Security \r\n8/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nCouncil as permanent members. That is unfair. The \r\nUnited Nations cannot pretend that the world has not \r\nchanged since 1945. We are no longer colonies. We are \r\nfree, independent sovereign States. We welcome the \r\nfact that the push for the reform of the Security Council \r\ncoming from Africa has had an impact and has given \r\nsome impetus to the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess that has been looking at the reforms. We will \r\ncontinue working with progressive States towards the \r\nexpansion of representation.\r\nAnother critical matter that needs attention is the \r\nselection of the Secretary-General, who is appointed by \r\nthe General Assembly on the recommendation of the \r\nSecurity Council. A review of that process is necessary \r\nso as to enable more meaningful participation on the \r\npart of the General Assembly in the process.\r\nThe President has identified human rights, \r\ngovernance, the rule of law, and the gender aspects of \r\nthe work of the United Nations as important areas of \r\nfocus for the seventieth session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe have to build upon the initial work undertaken \r\nin the development of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights in 1948 to enhance protection in areas \r\nsuch as racism, discrimination against women and the \r\npromotion of the rights of the child and the rights of \r\npeople with disabilities.\r\nWe also believe that the United Nations human \r\nrights system, especially its Human Rights Council, \r\nshould ensure a balance between civil and political \r\nrights, on the one hand, and economic, social and \r\ncultural rights, including the right to development, \r\non the other. The Human Rights Council must also be \r\nseen as an independent and impartial mechanism for \r\nthe entrenchment of a human rights culture throughout \r\nthe world. It should avoid the pitfalls of its predecessor, \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights, which was beset by \r\npoliticization and was caught up in the divide between \r\ndeveloped and developing countries.\r\nThis year also marks 50 years since the adoption \r\nof the International Convention on the Elimination of \r\nAll Forms of Racial Discrimination. The year 2015 also \r\nmarks 60 years since the adoption of the Freedom Charter \r\nin South Africa, which embodies the fundamental \r\nprinciples and values that are now enshrined in our \r\nConstitution. South Africa will continue to champion \r\nefforts in the United Nations human rights system \r\nto combat the scourges of racism, xenophobia, racial \r\ndiscrimination and related intolerances and to support \r\nwork aimed at the promotion of substantive global \r\nequality.\r\nThe seventieth general debate takes place in the \r\ncontext of growing international concern about the rise \r\nof violent extremism, terrorism and untold brutality, \r\nwhich we strongly condemn. We welcome the meetings \r\nthat will take place on the margins of the General \r\nAssembly to review the progress made in countering \r\nterrorism in the Middle East and North Africa.\r\nWe wish to emphasize that the Security Council \r\nmust take into account the views of the African continent \r\nand its subregional organizations when dealing with \r\nconflicts in Africa in future. The current situation in \r\nLibya and the Sahel region is a direct consequence of \r\nthe failure of some members of the Council to heed \r\ninformed counsel from the African Union. The norm of \r\nresponsibility to protect was abused for narrow political \r\ninterests that had nothing to do with the fundamental \r\naspects of the prevention of mass atrocities.\r\nThe current refugee crisis in Europe is, sadly, the \r\ndirect result of the militarization of civilian unrest, \r\nwhich included the massive arming of civilians and \r\nopposition groups in Libya, Syria and other affected \r\ncountries. That kind of problem is a deliberately man-\r\nmade problem, and it is critical that, in discussing \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism in parts of Africa and \r\nthe Middle East, we look into the root causes of the \r\nproblem and not just the symptoms. Also requiring our \r\nserious reflection is the regime change doctrine and its \r\nrole in perpetuating conflicts and instability in various \r\nparts of our continent and the world.\r\nWe welcome the recently signed peace agreement \r\nbetween the parties in South Sudan and urge the United \r\nNations and all stakeholders to support the Sudanese \r\npeople as they work to resolve their challenges. We \r\nreaffirm our support for the people of Western Sahara \r\nand urge the international community to encourage \r\ntheir struggle for self-determination, freedom, human \r\nrights and dignity.\r\nWe also welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States and the \r\nrelease of the Cuban Five. We reiterate our call for the \r\nlifting of the economic and financial embargo to help \r\nthe Cuban people to gain their economic freedom. We \r\nacknowledge the contribution of His Holiness Pope \r\nFrancis to the Cuban-United States normalization \r\nprocess. We also warmly welcome the contribution \r\nof the Holy Father generally to the global pursuit of \r\n15-29271 9/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\npeace, justice and the end of poverty and suffering, \r\nas eloquently expressed in the General Assembly and \r\nglobally.\r\nWe commend the United Nations for the key \r\nrole that it has played in peacekeeping and urge that \r\nresources be prioritized for this core role of the United \r\nNations, especially in Africa.\r\nThe failure of the parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to reach an \r\nagreement at the 2015 Review Conference — in the \r\nyear that marks 70 years since the first atomic bombs \r\nwere detonated in Japan — is a major setback to our \r\ncommitment to rid the world of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, especially nuclear weapons. There can be \r\nno safe hands where nuclear weapons are concerned. \r\nThe humanitarian consequences of a possible detonation \r\nof a nuclear weapon, whether intentional or accidental, \r\nwill be catastrophic for humankind.\r\nWe welcome the recent agreement reached on the \r\nIranian nuclear programme and the recognition of the \r\nright of Iran to the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\r\nThe seventieth session of the General Assembly \r\nhas seen the adoption of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda. The outcome document represents a victory \r\nfor the developing world, as it affirms that the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) should build on the unfinished business of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. Additionally, while \r\nthe 2030 Agenda is universal in its scope in that the \r\nSustainable Development Goals adopted apply to both \r\ndeveloped and developing countries, there is also \r\na clear recognition of the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and capabilities. The \r\nAgenda also contains a specific Goal on achieving \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women and \r\ngirls. That is all the more appropriate given that this \r\nyear is the twentieth anniversary of the Beijing Platform \r\nfor Action and the fifteenth anniversary of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000), on women, peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nAs the initiator of the Durban Platform for \r\nEnhanced Action — thanks to which the current round \r\nof negotiations under the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is taking \r\nplace — South Africa has a special interest in and \r\ncommitment to the success of the Paris session of the \r\nConference of the Parties later this year. We require \r\nthe fulfilment of all three parts of the Durban mandate, \r\nnamely, the closing of the current ambition gap in the \r\npre-2020 period through the honouring of existing \r\nlegal obligations by developed countries and enhanced \r\naction; the entry into force of the second commitment \r\nperiod of the Kyoto Protocol; and the adoption in \r\nParis of a new agreement for the post-2020 period that \r\ncontains all the essential elements, including the means \r\nof implementation and the measures relating to loss, \r\ndamage and response. We seek a fair, ambitious and \r\nlegally binding agreement in Paris that is applicable to \r\nall parties.\r\nIn addition, South Africa, as Chair of the G-77 plus \r\nChina, would not be able to accept a Paris package that is \r\nhollow or weak on finance. South Africa has submitted \r\nits intended nationally determined contribution to the \r\nUNFCCC secretariat ahead of the 1 October deadline, \r\nsignalling our readiness for Paris.\r\nWe join the world in celebrating the 70 years \r\nof existence of the United Nations. As we mark this \r\nhistoric anniversary, the reform of the Security Council \r\nand the strengthening of the General Assembly and \r\nother organs remain a paramount concern. By the end \r\nof this session, we should be in a position to adopt a road \r\nmap, with clear and implementable time frames, on the \r\npriorities of this Organization as well as on its reform. \r\nWe need to do this in order for the United Nations to \r\nremain a relevant force and a force for change in the \r\nworld.\r\nIn conclusion, let me express our deep appreciation \r\nof the offer made by China when it was addressing the \r\nAssembly, an offer that must go through the United \r\nNations. China spelled out the support it intended to \r\ngive to Africa: a total of $100 million of free military \r\nassistance to the African Union over the next five years \r\nto support the establishment of the African Standby \r\nForce and the African Capacity for Immediate Response \r\nto Crises. We would like to underline our gratitude to \r\nChina..\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of South Africa for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South \r\nAfrica, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\n10/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Abdel Fattah \r\nAl Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Al Sisi (spoke in Arabic): I should like \r\nto express to the President the warm salutations of the \r\npeople of Egypt. At the outset, I wish to congratulate \r\nhim, and his friendly country, Denmark, on his \r\nassumption of the presidency at the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly. I express my appreciation to \r\nhis predecessor, the Foreign Minister of our brotherly \r\ncountry Uganda, for his exceptional efforts during his \r\npresidency at the previous session.\r\nI should also like to commend the constructive \r\nrole played by the Secretary-General and his ceaseless \r\nefforts to uphold the principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, which has served as the constitutional bedrock \r\nand framework of reference for international relations \r\nfor 70 years.\r\nA few weeks ago, Egypt and the world witnessed \r\nthe inauguration of the new Suez Canal, an achievement \r\nthat will have a major impact in a number of economic \r\nfields, including transportation, trade and services. \r\nIt is also a statement of Egypt’s capability and the \r\ndetermination of its people to work diligently to \r\novercome challenges and obstacles. I do not intend to \r\ndwell on the particulars today, with which I am sure \r\nmembers are familiar. What I wish to highlight is \r\nthe significance of what we in Egypt have achieved. \r\nThe new Canal is not only Egypt’s gift to the world, \r\nit represents hope and the ability to transform that \r\nhope into tangible reality, with the promise of a new \r\ndirection, through hard work.\r\nMembers may agree with me that hope, that most \r\nimportant attribute, has provided the motive force that \r\nhas consistently driven individuals and peoples to search \r\nfor a better tomorrow. When hope is coupled with hard \r\nwork and commitment, it becomes a beacon of light \r\nthat can dispel the darkness of despair, a darkness that \r\ntoday lingers over the Middle East. Hope and hard work \r\nare the example that Egypt offers to its neighbours in \r\nAfrica, Asia and the Mediterranean by way of a helping \r\nhand in overcoming the challenges of the present and \r\nilluminating the path towards the future.\r\nIt is our belief in Egypt that the Middle East and \r\nthe world at large are living through perilous times and \r\nare in dire need of a model that offers new prospects \r\nfor the younger generations, providing them with \r\nopportunities for a brighter future. They must be shown \r\nthat with diligent work they can participate in crafting \r\nthis future.\r\nIt is against this background that I announce \r\nEgypt’s intention to launch, in conjunction with the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States and with the \r\nbroad participation of the young people of all nations, an \r\ninitiative called Hope and Action for a New Direction, \r\nor HAND according to the English acronym. This is \r\nthe hand that Egypt extends as part of its contribution \r\nto defeating the extremists and the ideas they seek to \r\nspread. The initiative will employ proactive measures \r\nrather than relying on resistance alone. This is in \r\ncontrast to the counter-terrorism efforts so far, which \r\nhave consisted solely of defensive reactions aimed at \r\npreserving the status quo. In parallel with those efforts, \r\nwe must seek ways of keeping our young people safe \r\nfrom extremists and false ideas and of channelling their \r\nproductive energies and capabilities into building the \r\nfuture that will soon be their own.\r\nGod has bestowed on humankind the gift of the \r\nmind, thereby enabling us to find Him. The fact that \r\nwe can use this mind to make choices is the ultimate \r\nproof that our differences and diversities are a product \r\nof divine will, which does not accept that human beings \r\nshould be devoid of purpose. Before that simple, palpable \r\ntruth, all the arguments made by extremists of all \r\nreligions and creeds fall apart, particularly arguments \r\nmade by those who claim to have a monopoly over \r\ninterpreting Islam. They forget that what they preach is \r\nnothing more than their own prejudiced interpretation \r\nof religion, which negates the truth of Islam’s tolerance, \r\njustice and mercy. Their rejection of the right of others \r\nto differ is a rejection of the Creator’s will. In reality, \r\ntheir goals are worldly and insidious, and they seek to \r\nrecruit and indoctrinate followers and isolate them from \r\nany opportunity to acquire a genuine understanding of \r\nreligion.\r\n15-29271 11/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nBut more than 1.5 billion Muslims have refused \r\nto subscribe to the views of this small minority, \r\nwhich claims to speak on their behalf and which seeks \r\nthrough violence and extremism to marginalize and \r\nsilence all those who oppose their designs. The whole \r\nworld should realize this. I feel the distress of every \r\nMuslim who suffers from discrimination and prejudice \r\nsolely because of belonging to this great religion. \r\nSuch discrimination is doubtless viewed by the forces \r\nof extremism as an unprecedented triumph, as one of \r\ntheir primary goals is to create the widest possible gulf \r\nbetween Muslims and the rest of the world.\r\nAllow me then to pose this question: How many \r\nMuslims must fall victim to the abominations of \r\nterrorism and extremism before the world recognizes \r\nthat we all, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, are at war \r\nwith the same enemy? That we face the same threat? \r\nHow much blood must be spilled in countries exposed \r\nto terrorism before the international community \r\nawakens to the reality of this scourge, which Egypt is \r\nnow confronting as a front-line Islamic country? When \r\nwill the international community acknowledge that \r\nthere is no alternative to solidarity between all peoples \r\nto defeat this evil, wherever it exists?\r\nWe all witnessed the downward spiral of Libya \r\nwhen the forces of extremism made their presence \r\nknown through actions that contradicted the principles \r\nof Islam and humanity. The slaughter of Egyptians on \r\nthe coast of Libya was the result of complacency in \r\nconfronting the expansion of extremists in defiance of \r\nthe will of the Libyan people, tolerating their exclusivist \r\ntendencies and allowing them to hold hostage the \r\ndestiny of Libya and its people.\r\nEgypt’s deep concern for Libya’s future, security \r\nand stability were the main driving force behind our \r\nsupport for United Nations efforts to reach a peaceful \r\nsettlement. This support played a significant role in \r\nachieving the Libyan political agreement, the Skhirat \r\nAgreement, which should be considered a milestone. \r\nFrom this point onwards, the international community \r\nshould consolidate its efforts and strengthen its support \r\nfor the parties to the Agreement with a view to rebuilding \r\nthe Libyan State, empowering it effectively to combat \r\nterrorism and enhancing its capacity to defeat the \r\nterrorists before they can establish a base from which to \r\ntarget Libya’s neighbours and extend their influence. In \r\nthis context I should like to emphasize the importance \r\nof continuing to foster an environment that is conducive \r\nto increased participation among Libyans who believe \r\nin a modern State, in parallel with an unflagging effort \r\nto eradicate terrorism.\r\nIn Syria, too, we have all observed how extremists \r\nhave exploited the legitimate aspirations of the people \r\nand have dragged this brotherly nation into a chaos \r\ndesigned only to further their own interests. In fact, \r\nconflicts have erupted between extremist organizations \r\nthemselves in the struggle over the spoils. Today, Syria \r\nis being torn apart. It is facing a major humanitarian \r\ncrisis, and the ambitions of regional parties have been \r\nexposed. In response to this dire situation, Egypt has \r\ncalled on the Syrian national parties to meet in Cairo \r\nto formulate a clear-cut plan for the interim period, \r\nas agreed in Geneva. That would provide a common \r\nground for all Syrians to build a democratic Syria, with \r\nsovereignty over the entirety of its territory, and in a \r\nmanner that would preserve the State and its institutions \r\nand protect its diversity and national identify. The \r\nSyrian national parties are invited today to participate \r\nmeaningfully in all efforts to negotiate a political \r\nresolution to the crisis that reflects the aspirations of \r\nthe Syrian people.\r\nEgypt’s political and military support for Yemen \r\nand its participation in the steps taken by the coalition \r\nof States in support of the legitimate Government were \r\nin response to Yemen’s request. They also arise from \r\nour sense of the need to protect Arab national security \r\nin the face of external attempts to intervene in an Arab \r\ncountry’s domestic affairs, as well as our commitment to \r\npreserving Yemen’s unity, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity. Egypt urges the international community to \r\nexert the necessary efforts to resume the transitional \r\npolitical process, in accordance with the Gulf initiative \r\nand its implementation mechanisms as well as the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nEgypt is closely following the latest developments \r\nin Iraq, and we hope that the reforms implemented by \r\nthe Government will contribute to restoring cohesion \r\nbetween the people of Iraq and advancing national \r\nreconciliation.\r\nAs Egypt has previously emphasized, the increasing \r\nplight of refugees f leeing from armed conflicts \r\nreaffirms the need to work towards resolving these \r\nconflicts and confronting the scourge of terrorism, \r\nwhich is a major aggravating factor. It necessitates \r\ncreating channels for legal immigration and facilitating \r\ntransportation, as well as linking international \r\nmigration and development.\r\n12/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nEgypt is host to an ever-increasing number of \r\nrefugees, who share with their Egyptian brethren \r\nthe social, education and health services provided by \r\nthe State, in spite of the economic burden that this \r\nrepresents. Egypt hopes that the solutions to this crisis \r\nwill be found, both in the short run to alleviate the \r\nhumanitarian suffering of refugees and in the long run \r\nthrough overcoming the fundamental causes of this \r\ncrisis.\r\nThe situations I have described point to the existing \r\nand ever-growing threat posed by terrorist organizations, \r\nwhich exploit political crises to achieve their objectives. \r\nIt is incumbent on me, as President of Egypt, a country \r\nthat is surrounded by such confrontations, to forewarn \r\nof the dangers that the expansion of this threat pose to \r\nother crises and regions, at the forefront of which is \r\nPalestine.\r\nThe question of Palestine is a just cause. Resolving \r\nthe Middle East conflict and empowering the Palestinian \r\npeople to exercise their right to self-determination and \r\nto an independent State within the pre-1967 borders, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, will effectively \r\neliminate one of the most important factors underlying \r\nthe region’s instability and used as a dangerous pretext \r\nto justify extremism and terrorism. Members will \r\ndoubtless agree with me that it is imperative to end \r\nthis conflict promptly, so that the nations of the region \r\nmay focus on building their future together in order to \r\nachieve prosperity and build a better future for coming \r\ngenerations. The ongoing events in Jerusalem and at \r\nthe Al-Aqsa Mosque demonstrate that achieving peace \r\ncontinues to face hurdles and challenges and that all of \r\nour efforts are required in the search for a definitive \r\nsolution.\r\nWe in Egypt realize the importance of other factors, \r\nin addition to defeating terrorism and extremism, \r\nin efforts to achieve stability and comprehensive \r\ndevelopment. The Egyptian uprising and its call for \r\nchange was an expression of our awareness of the need \r\nto build a modern nation, with all its components. We \r\nare aware that so far we have taken only a few steps and \r\nthat the path is long. We are committed to following \r\nthat path to the end, no matter the challenges we face.\r\nThis year, Egypt will hold parliamentary elections, \r\nin conformity with the road map for the future. The \r\npeople’s representatives can then exercise their oversight \r\nand legislative responsibilities during the upcoming \r\nphase. That phase will witness, God willing, the further \r\nrealization of the Egyptian people’s aspirations for \r\nfreedom, dignity and social justice. In this context, it \r\nis essential for me to highlight that the Government \r\nlaunched in March its sustainable development \r\nstrategy, known as Vision 2030, in parallel with the \r\ninternational community’s pursuit of an ambitious post-\r\n2015 development agenda.\r\nWe hope that this development agenda will take \r\ninto consideration the importance of our common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities in confronting the \r\nglobal challenges based on a disparity in capacities \r\nand resources, as well as the diversity of our cultures. \r\nDevelopment is a fundamental human right. To facilitate \r\nand promote that right, particularly in developing \r\ncountries and in Africa, is a joint responsibility and top \r\npriority particularly for the developed world.\r\nThe vision Egypt is proposing is the continuation \r\nof a long journey, one which began with human \r\nhistory itself. Throughout this journey, Egyptians \r\nhave continuously innovated. They have welcomed all \r\nthose who have passed through their land; hence their \r\ncontribution to human culture remains significant to \r\nthis day. Currently, as a candidate for a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council for the coming two \r\nyears, Egypt aspires to enhance its participation and \r\nto consolidate international peace and stability. The \r\nconfidence placed in Egypt by Member States will not \r\nbe regretted. Egypt is aware of the responsibilities it \r\nis about to shoulder at this critical juncture and will \r\nendeavour to reflect the interests of Africa, the Arab \r\nregion and the entire world. It will seek to uphold the \r\npurposes and principles of the United Nations Charter \r\nand the values that unite human beings and civilizations.\r\nThe banks of the River Nile witnessed the \r\nestablishment of the first building blocks of human \r\ncivilization. Egypt remained for many centuries a \r\ncentre of knowledge and art and a beacon of light for \r\nother countries and nations. In spite of the difficulties \r\nand setbacks endured by Egypt at other times, today \r\nthe Egyptian people long to make history once again. I \r\nam confident that, with God’s help, the Egyptian people \r\nwill be able to achieve their highest aspirations for \r\nthemselves, their country, their region and the whole \r\nworld. Long live Egypt!\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Arab Republic of Egypt for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\n15-29271 13/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Simonetta Sommaruga, President \r\nof the Swiss Confederation\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation.\r\nMs. Simonetta Sommaruga, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Simonetta \r\nSommaruga, President of the Swiss Confederation, and \r\nto invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sommaruga (spoke in French): On the \r\nruins of a world ravaged by the Second World War, \r\n51 countries decided to give humankind a forum for \r\nvoicing opinions again and came together to proclaim \r\nthe values enshrined in the Charter: dignity, human \r\nrights, equality, justice, tolerance and peace.\r\nIt is fitting that we celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of our Organization, which has achieved so \r\nmuch. It would be difficult to imagine a world without \r\nthe United Nations.It has contributed to reducing \r\npoverty in a great many countries, and it has achieved \r\nits primary goal: our generation is the first one not to \r\nhave lived through a world war. However, if we wish to \r\nmake an honest assessment we also need to be critical.\r\nToday, close to 120,000 soldiers are currently \r\nactive in United Nations peacekeeping missions. That \r\nmeans that the crises and the wars which ravage the \r\nworld are still far too many in number. Today we have \r\n60 million displaced persons worldwide, which is more \r\nthan at any time since the United Nations was founded. \r\nNot only have we not made sufficient progress when \r\ntackling certain problems, but we have created new \r\nones ourselves, such as global warming.\r\nEven though we might not like to admit this, we \r\nmust recognize that our behaviour continues to be \r\nmarked by major inconsistencies. I should like to offer \r\ntwo examples of that. First, many countries continue \r\nto live in abject poverty when they have a wealth of \r\nnatural resources. Secondly, we are concerned about \r\nmovements of mass migration, yet, by causing global \r\nwarming, we are depriving entire populations of the \r\nbasic conditions they need in order to remain where \r\nthey are.\r\nLet us ask ourselves why so many educated \r\nyoung people wish to leave their own countries. This \r\nconcerns not only developing countries but also a \r\nconsiderable number of European States as well. We \r\nmust acknowledge that we have not yet succeeded in \r\nachieving anything close to a fair global distribution of \r\nwealth, nor have we succeeded in establishing the rule \r\nof law as the norm. Corruption remains endemic.\r\nWe have to admit that we have not yet succeeded \r\nin combining growth with the protection of our \r\nenvironment. Furthermore, all too often national \r\ninterests impede the formulation of joint responses. I \r\nam thinking here specifically of the refugee crisis in \r\nthe Middle East and in Europe. Faced with such major \r\nf lows of migrants, the solutions can only be joint ones. \r\nIf we each continue to look after our own interests, we \r\nwill all lose out in the end — the migrants will lose \r\nout, and the solidarity between States will fall by the \r\nwayside. If we fail to protect human dignity, we do \r\nourselves a disservice, because to betray one’s own \r\nvalues is to betray oneself. I say once again, therefore, \r\nthat the refugee crises require responses based on \r\nsolidarity.\r\nOne cannot ask Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon to take \r\nin all the refugees f leeing the civil war in Syria. These \r\ncountries have already done so much, such admirable \r\nwork, which has received too little recognition thus \r\nfar. Similarly, it is not possible to ask a few European \r\ncountries to take in all of the refugees. We will \r\nall be judged on how we respond to this traumatic \r\nhumanitarian challenge.\r\nHere we face yet another inconsistency. If countries \r\nseek answers to such large-scale phenomena as the \r\ncurrent migration movements in an individualistic \r\nway, without coordinating, everything will be brought \r\nto a standstill. Human beings are not free from \r\ninconsistencies, none of us are. To some extent at least, \r\nthat is part of human nature. However, when it comes to \r\nthe actions of Governments, States and communities of \r\nStates, we must strive to minimize such inconsistencies. \r\nAs we all know, in order to address poverty, the \r\nchallenges of migration, conflicts, terrorism, organized \r\ncrime and climate change, collective action is vital.\r\n14/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nThe United Nations is more necessary than ever. \r\nWhat we require is a strong United Nations for a better \r\nworld. To that end, we need to focus on three priorities. \r\nThe ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) that we have just adopted \r\nis a huge step forward. We need to continue to impart \r\nthis momentum by achieving an ambitious agreement \r\nat the twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Paris.\r\nAs for the peace and security pillar, it affords \r\nus an opportunity to strengthen the United Nations, \r\nespecially with regard to the protection of the civilian \r\npopulation. Switzerland is convinced that one cannot \r\nresolve a conflict through a purely military approach. \r\nThe United Nations must base each of its actions on a \r\npolitical strategy aimed at finding a lasting solution to \r\nthe conflict. That self-evident truth was apparent during \r\nthe various peace and dialogue processes conducted in \r\nGeneva on Syria, Libya, Iran and Yemen.\r\nAs for the review of Security Council resolution \r\n1325 (2000), Switzerland will continue its effort to \r\npromote the participation of women in peace processes. \r\nWe must also grant women more responsibility when \r\nit comes to security-related issues. Their involvement \r\ncontributes to the duribility of peace agreements by \r\nexpanding the agenda of negotiations and by improving \r\nthe population’s commitment to such agreements.\r\nThe United Nations will review its global counter-\r\nterrorism strategy during the summer of 2016. \r\nThe implementation of this strategy is a priority \r\nfor Switzerland, especially the parts relating to \r\nterrorism prevention and respect for human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian law.\r\nFinally, Switzerland is also convinced that a \r\nstrong United Nations is a United Nations capable of \r\ntaking action and decisions when international peace \r\nand security are under threat. In this connection, we \r\nreiterate our long-standing call to the members of \r\nthe Security Council not to block or vote against any \r\nresolution aimed at preventing or putting an end to \r\ncrimes of genocide, crimes against humanity or war \r\ncrimes.\r\nHuman rights are the third pillar of the United \r\nNations. Here, Switzerland is proud to be seeking \r\nelection to the Human Rights Council for the 2016-2018 \r\nterm. Switzerland’s priorities on human rights are the \r\nabolition of the death penalty, the implementation of \r\nthe prohibition of torture, the promotion of women’s \r\nand children’s rights, and the protection of human \r\nrights defenders. It is also essential that the perpetrators \r\nof human rights violations be brought to justice. \r\nSwitzerland here wishes to recall the important role \r\nplayed by the International Criminal Court in the fight \r\nagainst impunity.\r\nAs far as the humanitarian system is concerned, it \r\nhas clearly reached its limits as a result of the growing \r\nnumber, longer duration and increasing complexity \r\nof crises. So far this year, 82 million people have \r\nrequired immediate humanitarian assistance. That is \r\nan unprecedented number. The World Humanitarian \r\nSummit, which is to be held in Istanbul in May 2016, \r\nwill afford us an opportunity to improve the efficiency \r\nof the humanitarian system in order to enable it to \r\nbetter and more effectively respond to victims’ needs.\r\nIn December, Geneva will host the thirty-second \r\nInternational Conference of the Red Cross and Red \r\nCrescent. That will be an important opportunity to \r\nmake progress towards the creation of an institutional \r\nframework in which to discuss how we can improve \r\ncompliance with international humanitarian law.\r\nLet us continue to work together to build a \r\nmodern and effective United Nations by reforming its \r\ngovernance. In this context, Geneva, as one of the main \r\ncentres of global governance, has an essential role to \r\nplay. The United Nations can count on the full support \r\nof my country, Switzerland, to strengthen it during the \r\nnext 70 years.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation for the statement \r\nshe has just made.\r\nMs. Simonetta Sommaruga, President of the Swiss \r\nConfederation, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\n15-29271 15/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Robert \r\nMugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Allow me at the outset to extend \r\nto Mr. Mogens Lykketoft my warm congratulations on \r\nhis election to the high office of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. He assumes this \r\noffice at an historic moment when the United Nations \r\nhas just adopted an ambitious agenda for the future of \r\nhumankind. The task ahead needs all hands on deck \r\nand he can count on our cooperation and support during \r\nhis presidency.\r\nI wish to commend Mr. Sam Kutesa, a distinguished \r\nson of Africa, for the dynamism with which he steered \r\nthis body over the past year. We particularly appreciated \r\nhis leadership in promoting inclusive dialogue and \r\nseeking consensus on the many sensitive issues that he \r\npresided over during his tenure of office.\r\nThe theme of this session — “The United Nations \r\nat 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human \r\nrights” — aptly complements the deliberations of the \r\nSummit meeting on the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nIt is our expectation that the United Nations will draw \r\nfrom its seven decades of experiences to give birth to \r\na new era of peace, equality and justice, a new era that \r\nrecognizes and fosters the commonality of our common \r\nfate through renewed international cooperation and \r\nsolidarity. The African Union welcomes the priorities \r\nthe President has proposed, for they go in tandem with \r\nour own development plan, the Agenda 2063, which \r\nrecognizes the intrinsic and inextricable linkages \r\nbetween peace, security, development and the full \r\nrealization of human rights.\r\nThe African Union Constitutive Act recognizes \r\nthat while peace and security are imperative for our \r\nprogress, conflict is a major impediment to the socio-\r\neconomic advancement and integration of the continent. \r\nConsequently, the Common African Position on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda designates peace and \r\nsecurity as one of its six key pillars. It is a top priority \r\nfor us.\r\nThe prevalence of peace not only creates conditions \r\nconducive to development, but also ensures that the \r\nmaximum possible resources can be dedicated to \r\ndevelopment programmes and projects. We welcome \r\nand encourage the continued cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union, principally \r\nthrough the latter’s Peace and Security Council, in \r\nadvancing peace and security in Africa.\r\nIn January, the leaders of the African Union adopted \r\nAgenda 2063 as our continent’s plan to accelerate \r\ndeepened economic integration of our countries and \r\nregions. Its main objective is to improve the well-\r\nbeing of the continent’s citizenry through sustained \r\nand balanced economic growth. At the African Union \r\nSummit in Pretoria, South Africa, in June this year we \r\nagreed on the Agenda’s first 10-year development plan.\r\nDuring these initial 10 years, the f lagship \r\nprogrammes will include the creation of a continental \r\nfree-trade area, an African centre for disease control, \r\na pan-Africa university of science and technology to \r\ndevelop skills for the value addition and beneficiation \r\nof the continent’s vast mineral resources, a single \r\naviation market, a high-speed train, and a pan-African \r\ne-network.\r\nThe successful implementation of Agenda 2063 calls \r\nnot just for the commitment of African stakeholders but \r\nalso for the support and engagement of partners beyond \r\nthe borders of our continent. Africa is not looking for \r\nhandouts. Rather it is looking for partners in massive \r\ninfrastructure development, in creating and exploiting \r\nthe value chains from its God-given natural resources, \r\nand in improving the quality of life of the continent’s \r\ncitizens. The entire world stands to benefit more from \r\nan economically empowered African continent than \r\nfrom one emasculated by deprivation and with an over-\r\ndependence on others.\r\nAdaptation to change is the most crucial ingredient \r\nfor the vibrancy and effectiveness of any organization, \r\nincluding the United Nations. While the world has \r\ndrastically changed since 1945, the United Nations, \r\nand indeed the global governance architecture, remains \r\nmired in a long bygone era. This archaic hierarchy \r\namong nations threatens to erode the confidence and \r\nsupport that the United Nations commands among the \r\nmajority, but disadvantaged, of its membership. We are \r\ndisappointed that we have lost the opportunity of this \r\nanniversary to address this burning issue of Security \r\nCouncil  reform in a manner that satisfies the just \r\ndemands and expectations of the majority among us.\r\nI wish to reiterate our strong attachment to Africa’s \r\ncommon position on Security Council reform contained \r\nin the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. \r\nI call on all genuine friends of Africa and all those \r\n16/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nwho value justice, fairness and democracy to support \r\nAfrica’s just and reasonable proposals.\r\nWe equally call for the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the sole universally representative \r\nand democratic organ of the United Nations, so that \r\nit can effectively carry out its Charter-mandated \r\nresponsibilities. Accordingly, we fully support the \r\ncall for inclusivity and transparency in selecting our \r\nOrganization’s Secretary-General by ensuring that \r\nthe General Assembly plays a more significant role in \r\nthat process. After all, the Secretary-General is at the \r\nservice of all the Member States, and not only that of an \r\nexclusive, privileged few.\r\nRespecting and upholding human rights is the \r\nobligation of all States and is enshrined in the United \r\nNations Charter. Nowhere does the Charter arrogate the \r\nright to some to sit in judgement over others in carrying \r\nout this universal obligation. In that regard, we reject the \r\npoliticization of this important issue and the application \r\nof double standards to victimize those who dare think \r\nand act independently of the self-anointed prefects of \r\nour time. We equally reject attempts to prescribe new \r\nrights that are contrary to our values, norms, traditions \r\nand beliefs. We are not gays. Cooperation and respect \r\nfor each other will advance the cause of human rights \r\nworldwide; confrontation, vilification and double \r\nstandards will not.\r\nSelf-determination and independence are intrinsic \r\nand fundamental rights that should be enjoyed by all \r\npeoples everywhere, without distinction. We are deeply \r\nconcerned by the continued denial of this basic right \r\nto the Saharan people. We urge the United Nations to \r\nexpeditiously finalize what must be done to conclude \r\nthe decolonization of the Western Sahara.\r\nIn the Middle East, the suffering of the Palestinian \r\npeople continues unabated. What does Mr. Obama \r\nsay about that? We reiterate our unwavering support \r\nfor the just cause of the Palestinian people. Do we \r\nagree, Mr. United States? We also reiterate that lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East can be achieved only through \r\nnegotiations to achieve a two-State solution based on \r\nthe pre-1967 borders. We are concerned at the increase \r\nin tensions in that region and urge the United Nations \r\nto assume its responsibility and bring an end to this \r\nsenseless conflict.\r\nThe promotion of gender equality is critical for \r\nthe realization of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nThe African Union has designated 2015 as the Year \r\nof Women’s Empowerment and Development towards \r\nAgenda 2063 in order to mobilize our individual \r\nand collective actions around this key issue. Gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment are central to the \r\nachievement of human development, progress and the \r\nelimination of the scourge of poverty and deprivation. \r\nWe must continue to build upon the achievements \r\nthat have been realized since the 1995 Fourth World \r\nConference on Women and the Beijing Declaration and \r\nPlatform for Action.\r\nThe growing list of phenomena that neither respect \r\nnor know any borders makes it imperative that we \r\nmobilize all mechanisms for cooperation to effectively \r\novercome them. Terrorism and extremist violence, \r\ncommunicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis, malaria, bird f lu, and Ebola cannot be \r\novercome single-handedly. The United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies are the place and the mechanism \r\nfor this indispensable and necessary cooperation.\r\nFor some months now, we have watched heartbreaking \r\nand harrowing scenes of desperate refugees seeking \r\nto enter Europe in search of safety and shelter from \r\nthe ravages of conflict in their own homelands. We \r\nhave also read of the tragedy and loss of life in the \r\nMediterranean. The majority of the affected people \r\nare from Syria or from other countries devastated by \r\nconflict and instability, induced in great part by the \r\ndestabilizing policies of external forces.\r\nThis tragic situation could have been avoided \r\nthrough respect for the independence of other countries \r\nand non-interference in their internal affairs. In the \r\ncase of Libya, we are witnessing the results of abusing \r\nthe authority of the Security Council and ignoring the \r\nopinion of regional organizations, in this instance the \r\nAfrican Union, that are supposed to be the partners of \r\nthe United Nations in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMy country, Zimbabwe, is committed to a fair, just \r\nand effective United Nations in which multilateralism, \r\ninclusivity and transparency replace unilateralism, \r\nexclusion and back-room deals. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations is built on the bedrock of the sovereign \r\nequality and independence of its Members, without \r\ndistinction as to their geographical size, economic \r\nmight or any other endowments or qualifications. We \r\nare deeply attached to these principles and call on other \r\nMembers of the United Nations to be similarly disposed. \r\nThe United Nations was set up, among other purposes, to \r\n15-29271 17/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\n“develop friendly relations among nations”. Zimbabwe \r\ndesires and is committed to nurturing friendly relations \r\nwith other nations, but it cannot tolerate interference in \r\nits domestic affairs.\r\nWe invite other countries with which we may \r\nhave differences of whatever nature — including the \r\nUnited States and the NATO Powers — to eschew \r\nthreats, pressures and punitive actions in favour of \r\nreconciliation, friendship and dialogue. I therefore \r\ndenounce in the strongest terms the illegal sanctions \r\nthat are imposed on my country by the European Union \r\nand the United States of America and call for their \r\nimmediate and unconditional removal. We do not know \r\nwhat wrong we have done to the United States. I would \r\nkindly ask it to leave us free and independent to do our \r\nown thing. Once more, I put on record that my country \r\nis desirous to live in harmony with all countries big and \r\nsmall. We have peace in Zimbabwe just now. We do not \r\nwant war. We do not want interference. We do not want \r\nto hear of regime change at all.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of our Organization has \r\nbeen marked by the adoption of a far-reaching Agenda \r\nthat has the potential to drastically transform our \r\nworld in all aspects. We are under no illusion about the \r\nchallenges that lie ahead, but we are not discouraged, \r\neither. Humankind has, over the epochs, demonstrated \r\nan immense tenacity in overcoming inertia and \r\nresistance to change. Now is our time to leave our own \r\npositive mark on the history of human development and \r\ninteraction. Posterity expects no less from us.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Zimbabwe for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Cristina Fernández, President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic.\r\nMs. Cristina Fernández, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Ms. Cristina \r\nFernández, President of the Argentine Republic, and to \r\ninvite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Fernández (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, allow me to welcome a very relevant \r\nevent that took place here a few days ago — on \r\n10 September — when, by 136 votes in favour, the \r\nGeneral Assembly approved the Basic Principles on \r\nSovereign Debt Restructuring Processes (resolution \r\n69/319). That was a very significant triumph. \r\nNew principles have been established — which I \r\nhave written down here so that I do not forget any of \r\nthem — that should guide how we address and resolve \r\nmatters when a country has decided to renegotiate \r\nits external debt. They include the sovereignty of a \r\ncountry to decide its own macroeconomic policies \r\nand how it will restructure its debt; good faith, \r\ntransparency, impartiality, and equitable treatment so \r\nas not to distinguish among different creditors and so \r\nthat everybody is treated in the same manner. They \r\nalso include sovereign immunity from jurisdiction and \r\nexecution, as well as legitimacy and sustainability.\r\nThe latter is perhaps one of the most important \r\nprinciples, as it refers to repaying and honouring one’s \r\ndebts — not at the cost hunger and poverty for the \r\npeople, but through a political and economic project and \r\nthrough macroeconomic variables that should make the \r\ndevelopment and growth of society sustainable. \r\nFinally comes perhaps the most important principle \r\nlacking today in terms of regulation of  sovereign debt. \r\nIt is a logical principle that applies in nearly all the \r\ndomestic legal systems throughout the world. When a \r\ncompany goes bankrupt and is unable to pay its debts in \r\nany country — including in this one, the United States \r\nof America, where municipalities are also allowed to \r\ngo bankrupt — how is consensus reached? Through a \r\nqualified majority. When 66 per cent of the creditors \r\nhere in the United States, and also in my own country \r\nof the Argentine Republic, come to an agreement with \r\nthe debtor with regard to timetables and the form of \r\nthe payment, that becomes law and is mandatory for \r\nthe other creditors. Let me repeat, when 66 per cent \r\nagree. That principle also enshrines the idea that when \r\nthe majority decides on a form of payment, that should \r\nbe accepted by everybody else.\r\n18/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nMr. Arízaga (Ecuador), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThis agreement — these principles and \r\nconventions — was approved here, and we have decided \r\nto submit it to our parliament for it to become an \r\ninstrument of public order that controls our country’s \r\ndomestic practices. It has its roots in the default that \r\nArgentina experienced in 2000, history’s largest \r\nsovereign default. At that time the world was growing \r\nby more than good rates. However, Argentina went \r\nbankrupt as a result of debts that had been incurred \r\nmuch earlier. In fact, to be more accurate, it began in \r\nearnest in 1976, when there was a coup d’état and the \r\ncountry’s constitutional order was overthrown, and \r\nbegan to deepen in the 1990s with the convertibility \r\nregime, by which they made us Argentines believe that \r\nan Argentine peso was worth $l. That culminated in the \r\n2001 default and in institutional bankruptcy: there were \r\nfive different Governments in just one week.\r\nArgentina, however, was able to rebuild its economy \r\nand its society when politics once again took control \r\nover the economy starting on 25 May 2003. It was then \r\ndecided to summon creditors to a first restructuring \r\noffer in 2005, and again in 2010 under my presidency. \r\nThe first restructuring was during the presidency of \r\nNéstor Carlos Kirchner, who in his first address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly (see A/58/PV.11) said that the dead \r\ndid not pay their debts and that it was necessary for \r\nthe creditors to allow Argentina to grow in order to \r\nbe able to pay. That was neither a premonition on his \r\npart nor a matter of foretelling the future. He simply \r\napplied economic logic: it was impossible to pay a debt \r\nin the absence of growth in the economy of the debtor \r\ncountry. That is when Argentina began its inexorable \r\nprocess of getting out of debt.\r\nBut it also had to do with what happened in 2005, \r\nwhen it was decided to pay off the total debt to the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), which had been \r\nimposing macroeconomic policies on our country. That \r\nis when Argentina began to grow and linked itself up \r\nas yet another wagon to the locomotive engine of the \r\nemerging countries, which were the ones that had been \r\nsupporting the sustained growth of the international \r\neconomy. Let us not forget that the greatest growth was \r\nled by the emerging countries, essentially headed by \r\nthe giants of Asia.\r\nDuring my first address to the General Assembly \r\nas President of the Argentine Republic, in September \r\n2008 (see A/63/PV.5), I noted how the locomotive \r\nthat was driving the world to sustained growth had \r\nanother locomotive engine added to it. Like those old \r\ntrains with two locomotive engines, this one now also \r\nhad two: China and the rest of the emerging countries, \r\npulling towards growth with rates that in the case of \r\nChina had already attained 14 per cent growth in gross \r\ndomestic product by 2007.\r\nThen in 2008, with the fall of Lehman Brothers on \r\nWall Street, came an economic crisis that we are still \r\nexperiencing, but with several differences. Although it \r\nbegan here at the very heart of international finance, \r\nthere had in fact been signs of a crisis, namely, the \r\n2007 sub-prime mortgage crisis, which ultimately \r\nexploded in 2008. The year 2009 marked the global \r\neconomic collapse, except in Asian countries. Even in \r\nLatin America, we experienced negative growth that \r\nyear. In 2010 the crisis spread to the eurozone, and off \r\nthey went to the rescue of indebted countries. We all \r\nknow that was a euphemism; the banks were actually \r\nthe ones they went to rescue. Billions of dollars were \r\ntransferred to banking institutions. I still remember a \r\ndiscussion that took place in London at the Group of 20. \r\nOur position was that, while it was necessary to save \r\nthe banks to stave off a 1930s-type depression, it was \r\nalso absolutely essential that there be regulation so that \r\nthe tide of resources that was being injected into the \r\nfinancial sector should f low back to the real economy, \r\nenter the goods and services production cycle and make \r\nthe wheels of growth turn again.\r\nBut none of that happened. Indeed, on the contrary, \r\nadjustment policies were the consideration in exchange \r\nfor being rescued. And the adjustment policy imposed \r\non the eurozone caused a recession in that zone and a \r\ndrop in employment to unprecedented lows: 50 per cent \r\nof young people in Italy unemployed, with double-digit \r\nunemployment in Spain as well.\r\nThat is how we got to 2014 and 2015, with a \r\nsharp decrease in global demand. Now we see how \r\nthat crisis train — the Lehman Brothers locomotive \r\nengine, which departed from here, in the heart of Wall \r\nStreet, and stopped off in Europe — is trying to move \r\non to the emerging economies, we who underpinned \r\neconomic growth for so long. Argentina was and is part \r\nof that growth. This year, despite difficulties and the \r\nharassment by vulture funds, which do not collect nor \r\ndo they allow the 92.7 per cent that agreed to the two \r\nrestructurings to collect, with the complicity of a certain \r\npart of this country’s judiciary, there are demands that \r\n15-29271 19/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nwe pay 7 per cent of the creditors $20 billion, when the \r\nrestructuring accepted by the 92 per cent had amounted \r\nto $40 billion.\r\nWhat is the capitalistic logic behind this? What \r\nis the mathematical model for this? How long would \r\nit take us to restructure those 93 per cent if we met \r\nthe demands of these predatory financiers, who make \r\nup only 7 per cent of the creditors, and paid them half \r\nof what we paid to 92 per cent of the creditors? Any \r\nlogical judge would say that was not right. One cannot \r\npay to 7 per cent of the creditors half of what one pays \r\nthe other 92 per cent of the creditors, particularly when \r\nsome of the 7 per cent had bought lots of these bonds \r\nafter Argentina had already defaulted on its external \r\ndebt.\r\nIt is for that reason that the approval of the \r\nBasic Principles on Sovereign Debt Restructuring \r\nProcesses — for which there are some precedents \r\nalready through anti-vulture laws such as those in \r\nthe Kingdom of Belgium — represents help, not to \r\nArgentina, which is depositing 100 per cent of its \r\ndebt to its creditors, but help to the rest of the world. \r\nIt is the first serious attempt to introduce fairness and \r\nregulation to the financial and derivatives sectors, \r\nwhich, from the moment that merchant banks became \r\ninvestment banks, have remained outside the scope of \r\nall oversight and intervention.\r\nThat is why we say that what was agreed on \r\n10 September was a very significant and major step \r\nforward that must also be in line with the fact that the \r\nworld is not doing well at all. That is not news to anyone. \r\nWe could talk about the refugee crisis resulting from \r\nthe action of financial predators in countries that do \r\nnot manage to support their people who have to migrate \r\nto Europe in canoes or rafts from Africa, or about the \r\nrefugees who have to f lee their homelands because of \r\nwarlords.\r\nI also want to talk to the Assembly about an \r\nunprecedented process of economic concentration \r\nthat is unheard of in the world. According to the most \r\nrecently released IMF report, 1 per cent of the global \r\npopulation at present is holding 50 per cent of the \r\nwealth. Here, in this very country that once hosted the \r\nAmerican dream — the dream of the American middle \r\nclasses, which encouraged and continues to encourage \r\nso many Latin Americans to come here — 1 per cent \r\nhave more than 30 per cent of the total wealth. How long \r\ncan such a society or the world continue when income \r\ndistribution is that unfair and with all the consequences \r\nof such unfairness?\r\nYesterday, at President Xi Jinping’s gender equality \r\nmeeting, we pondered how gender empowerment could \r\nbe discussed in a world in which resources are so \r\nunequally distributed; how much gender equality can \r\nwe find in a world that expels people from their home \r\ncountries because they have become unlivable and when \r\nthey are refused entry into other countries? That forces \r\nus to address the problem of the financial markets and \r\nthe need to reinject resources into the real economy so \r\nthat employment and production can be resumed as the \r\nmain engines for societies’ welfare.\r\nI should also like to welcome the fact — and \r\ncommend the United States of America, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council and Germany — that an agreement \r\nwas reached on nuclear issues that will help to defuse \r\nthe situation and provide more certainty and security to \r\na world shrouded in conflicts and warmongering. We \r\nwere aware of those negotiations. We harboured hopes \r\nthat this agreement would eventually see the light of \r\nday. \r\nMembers will wonder how we knew. Easy. In \r\n2010 Gary Samore, at that time the White House’s top \r\nadviser on nuclear issues, visited us in Argentina. He \r\ncame to visit Argentina on a mission with one goal. In \r\n1987, under the first democratic Government and under \r\nthe control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, \r\nArgentina supplied the nuclear fuel for the reactor \r\nknown as “Tehran”. Gary Samore explained to our \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Héctor Timerman, \r\nthat negotiations were under way on an agreement \r\nfor the Islamic Republic of Iran to cease its uranium \r\nenrichment activities or to do it to a lesser extent, but \r\nthat Iran claimed that it needed to enrich for the Tehran \r\nnuclear reactor and that was hindering negotiations. \r\nThey came to ask us to provide nuclear fuel to the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran. President Rouhani was not yet \r\nin office. The negotiations had begun under President \r\nAhmadinejad.\r\nI remember that the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\ncame to see me and submitted to me the proposal that \r\nGary Samore had brought. He had already informed \r\nthe White House envoy that his request would be very \r\ndifficult to satisfy given the relationship between \r\nArgentina and the Islamic Republic of Iran because \r\nof the terrorist attack against the Argentine Israelite \r\n20/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nMutual Association (AMIA) that had taken place in \r\n1994 and the decision of the judge in the case to press \r\ncharges against five Iranian citizens and summon \r\nthem to appear in court. Against that backdrop, it was \r\nimpossible for Argentina to make a contribution to the \r\nnegotiation process, which, I repeat, was already under \r\nway in 2010. I looked at the Minister in my office — I \r\nrecall this clearly — and I said that if the request was \r\nmade in writing and signed, we could cooperate despite \r\nall that, because we believed that the attainment of the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation objective was important.\r\nMembers know that Argentina is a member of a \r\nselect club of nuclear energy-producing countries but \r\nthat, nonetheless, we occupy a leading position in the \r\nfield of non-proliferation. Therefore, for us nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation is also a question of governmental \r\ninterest. That is what I said to my Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, who in turn conveyed to the White House \r\nenvoy that we would agree to provide the fuel, because \r\nit had been in the hands of Argentina since 1987 and we \r\nalso had the necessary technology to produce it — in \r\nexchange, obviously, for such a request to be submitted \r\nin writing and signed. That message was conveyed. I \r\nbelieve that that was the last time that the Minister saw \r\nMr. Samore.\r\nThus by 2013, when Argentina signed the \r\nmemorandum of understanding with the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran to unblock the legal matter that had \r\nbrought the case to a halt years ago — and please \r\nbear in mind that the attack took place in 1994 and I \r\nam now referring to what happened in 2013 — other \r\nGovernments had intervened, there had been other \r\ndevelopments. And, because we were strongly convinced \r\nof the need to combat terrorism and of the importance \r\nof remembering, of honouring truth and justice and \r\nclarification, we were trying to find those who were \r\nguilty of that terrorist attack and to punish them. \r\nThat was the objective of the memorandum of \r\nunderstanding. However, it seems as if all hell broke \r\nloose with the signing of the memorandum. Time passed, \r\nand when the agreement was signed on 2 April between \r\nthe 5+1 and Iran — no longer with Ahmadinejad but \r\nwith Rouhani — and with the negotiations well under \r\nway, one could not but wonder why there was so much \r\nopposition and criticism against us negotiating with \r\nIran a simple agreement of judicial cooperation for the \r\nArgentine judge to depose in Teheran the five Iranian \r\ncitizens accused because of the laws that prevented the \r\nextradition of Iranian citizens. What was the reason? \r\nI learned it here from the mouth of another President \r\nregarding hypocrisy in diplomatic relations. There is \r\nmuch hypocrisy blended with a lot of geopolitics and \r\nvery little interest in setting the record straight when \r\nit comes to remembering and honouring the truth and \r\njustice demanded by the victims and their families.\r\nWe later sent a bill on this treaty to our Congress, \r\nwhich approved. I say to President Obama that I \r\nfervently hope that the United States Congress will \r\nalso approve the agreement, or at least refrain from \r\nblocking it, as it will be an important contribution to \r\nglobal peace.\r\nWe are coherent in our approach. It is not that what \r\napplies to us does not apply to others, although we use \r\nelements or instruments that have little to do with the \r\nobjectives we declare to harm the relation or the image \r\nof a country, but that is the reality of the situation.\r\nFinally, the judge hearing the AMIA case also \r\nconsidered it to be a mechanism apt to shed light and \r\nto allow him to depose the accused. An appellate court \r\nwas not of the same mind, and today the case has all but \r\ncome to a halt. Today we can appeal only to the goodwill \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, because we have no \r\nother instrument to obtain the Iranians’ depositions.\r\nBut there have been developments in my country. \r\nUnder way today, on the grounds of concealment, is an \r\naction brought against the highest ranking authorities \r\nand intelligence and judicial officials taking part in the \r\nAMIA case since 1994. The proceeding is now at the \r\noral and public trial stage.\r\nAfter my order late last year to remove from office \r\nwhole sectors of Argentina’s intelligence officials \r\non the grounds of strong suspicions that they had \r\nhindered the investigation and opposed attempts to \r\nunblock the case by going and deposing the Iranians, \r\nI dismissed some high-ranking officials, some of \r\nwhom had been in office since 1972 and had rendered \r\nservices to all the dictatorial Governments and all \r\nthe other Administrations, including my own. Some \r\nof those dismissed officials have settled here in the \r\nUnited States. A few days after these dismissals, the \r\ninvestigating prosecutor, Alberto Nisman, died.\r\nAll this amounts to something more than I have \r\nalready said. I have always maintained that AMIA \r\nwas a complex game of chess in international politics. \r\nToday I believe that, in addition to a chess game, it is \r\nalso spiderweb of interests alien to my country. As with \r\n15-29271 21/22\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.14\r\nall spiderwebs, it is only the weakest and the smallest \r\nthat get caught, while the others remain outside.\r\nIn the trial for concealment being pursued now, the \r\ncommencement of which was delayed almost 14 years, \r\nand also in the investigation under way into the death \r\nof Prosecutor Nisman, some details are being revealed \r\nof horrific linkages to external secret services, bank \r\naccounts abroad and relationships with vulture funds \r\nthat have been denounced not by me but by individuals \r\nwho are themselves members of my country’s Jewish \r\ncommunity.\r\nI am not here to talk with hypocrisy or lies, I am \r\ntalking about what is actually happening. A few days \r\nago we summoned the United States Ambassador \r\nin our country for an explanation of the capacity in \r\nwhich a particular former member of the intelligence \r\nservices of Argentina was in the United States. He was \r\nin charge of the entire investigation of the AMIA case \r\nfrom the outset. I was just a provincial deputy in the \r\nsouth of the country, in Patagonia, and a delegate to the \r\nconstitutional convention when the bomb exploded, and \r\nthat person was already in charge of the investigation. \r\nThe investigation into the death of Prosecutor Nisman \r\nis now proving his total and absolute connection with \r\nthe Prosecutor, as well as that of other individuals. \r\nOn instructions from the Ministry for Foreign \r\nAffairs, our Ambassador to the United States has \r\nsubmitted two letters to the State Department and also \r\nheld meetings with the State Department to ask in what \r\ncapacity that person was here in the United States. He \r\nis almost protected. I do not know from what or from \r\nwhom, but he is here and protected. A few days ago, \r\nthe new prosecutors in the AMIA case asked Interpol \r\nto issue a Blue Notice concerning the whereabouts of \r\nthat individual. \r\nAs we have been doing since 2007, first President \r\nKirchner and then me, every year we have been \r\nrequesting the cooperation of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran to clarify the attack. Today we are also asking \r\nfor the cooperation of the United States. Judges in our \r\ncountry want to know the whereabouts of this official \r\nwhom everybody refers to as someone closely connected \r\nto the case, and a cover-up is even mentioned.\r\nMembers may ask themselves why I spend so much \r\ntime on this issue. It is very little compared with the \r\ntime that organizations paid by vulture funds have \r\ndevoted in this country to criticizing, slandering and \r\noffending us as if we were accomplices of the Iranian \r\nregime. If we are accomplices of the Iranian regime, \r\nthen what is President Barack Obama? Is he not also?\r\nHypocrisy and double standards cannot continue \r\nin diplomacy. We cannot continue to use weapons \r\nand instruments of international intrigue — old \r\nones — worthy of a John le Carré novel. The world is \r\na world of communications, of the globalization of the \r\nInternet, which some dreamed would enable them to \r\nbetter dominate the entire world. Today the Internet is \r\na very powerful communication tool for everyone, the \r\nentire global village where everybody knows instantly \r\nwhat is happening in a particular place in the world.\r\nOur Government in Argentina will tirelessly \r\ncontinue to seek truth and justice in the AMIA case. We \r\nask for the cooperation of the country whose citizens \r\nare accused, and of this country, the United States, \r\nso that it will also help to clarify the presence of this \r\ncitizen, who will surely be required, as he is already \r\nbeing required, by the State agencies in our country.\r\nIn this world of economic crisis — and I was \r\nlistening closely to some of today’s speeches — the \r\ntruth is that enemies change and mutate with amazing \r\nspeed. I remember the most recent G-20 meeting in \r\nwhich I participated — I was absent for the last one \r\nfor health reasons — in St. Petersburg, where those \r\nwho confronted the Government of Syria, the freedom \r\nfighters, were those who had to be supported by the \r\nentire Western world. Today the freedom fighters are \r\npart of the Islamic State of Iraq and Shams. I should \r\nlike to ask members how this seemingly Islamic group \r\nactually functions. Who finances it? \r\nWhen one sees these horrendous scenes where \r\npeople have their throats slit and where one can clearly \r\nsee three or four cameras filming the scenes, it is like \r\na movie. It is not simply a home-made film such as a \r\nfundamentalist group could make with a simple camera. \r\nNo, this is almost a full-on production. At times it \r\nseems almost like a Francis Ford Coppola movie. Four \r\nor five cameras are used, and the faces are never shown. \r\nIt would be good if we asked ourselves from where is all \r\nthis financed. That would help to ensure that the world \r\ncan find clues to combat one of the worst scourges \r\nfacing humankind today: fundamentalism of whatever \r\nnature, whether dogmatic or religious, but mainly those \r\nwho consider their neighbour an enemy and a target to \r\nbe eliminated.\r\nI do not want to leave the Assembly today only with \r\nproblems of debt and the economy or terrorist attacks \r\n22/22 15-29271\r\nA/70/PV.14 28/09/2015\r\nand international complicity. I also wish to pay homage \r\nto the continent of which I feel I am a daughter, Latin \r\nAmerica. \r\nNot long before I spoke, the President of Cuba, \r\nRaứl Castro, a President and a comrade whom I love \r\nand admire, spoke to the Assembly. For the first \r\ntime in 17 years the President of Cuba is back here in \r\nthe General Assembly. The truth is that for us Latin \r\nAmericans, members of the Common Market of the \r\nSouth, the Union of South American Nations and the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nwho have struggled so much, discussed so much and \r\nargued so much so that Cuba can return to be part of \r\nthese multilateral entities, we see this as a triumph \r\nof perseverance by the region, and fundamentally an \r\nachievement by Cuba.\r\nWe also recognize the Government of the United \r\nStates, which has finally opened its mind and understood \r\nthat things could not continue as they had done in the \r\npast. I should like to thank another Latin American \r\nwho was also in this very same Hall — and who has \r\nperhaps greater authority than the rest of us because he \r\nsits on the throne of St. Peter in Rome — who played a \r\ndetermining role in establishing the agreement between \r\nthe United States and Cuba. He came here and spoke \r\nfrom this platform (see A/70/PV.3) to the world and \r\nsaid that money cannot continue to determine politics \r\nand that there was a basic principle understood by all \r\nreligions, that is, “Do not do to others what you would \r\nnot like others to do to you”.\r\nAs a Latin American I also had the joy of seeing the \r\nother day in Havana the photograph of the President of \r\nColombia, the President of Cuba and the representative \r\nof the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \r\nlaunching the end of a conflict that has been going on \r\nfor more than 50 years and that they had tried to end \r\nwith bombs and rif les. No, political, social and cultural \r\nconflicts are not resolved with bombs and rif les; they \r\nare resolved by talking, through dialogue and the \r\nacceptance of others.\r\nI am pleased to be part of the Latin American \r\nregion, where we do not have religious or cultural \r\nclashes, where we are all children or grandchildren of \r\nimmigrants and where we still receive even internal \r\nmigrations. In my country the public and free national \r\nuniversities host students from across the continent. \r\nWe do not issue a red card to anyone, for we believe it \r\nis necessary to contribute to and establish a more just \r\nworld.\r\nFor that reason I say that Latin America — once \r\nperhaps the emblem of inequality — with the growth \r\nachieved by the national, popular and democratic \r\nGovernments that some call populist but which have \r\nincorporated millions of our fellow citizens and which \r\nhave allowed our citizens to enjoy the benefits of \r\neducation, health and housing — today we say that we \r\nare a growing continent, a continent of integration.\r\nPerhaps the contribution that Argentina has \r\nmade — it was left alone in 2001 but could still \r\nreconstruct our country, and today its gross domestic \r\nproduct will grow by 2.7 per cent — allows us to say that \r\ninclusion, growth, development, production and trade \r\nwill be reactivated only by employing the millions who \r\nhave lost their jobs, improving the wages of those who \r\nget a pittance, respecting the rights of young people and \r\nchildren and, on the basis of synthesis, creating a fairer, \r\nmore equitable and more egalitarian society.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic for the statement \r\nshe has just made.\r\nMs. Cristina Fernández, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.55 p.m.\r\n"
