However, what followed after \r\nthat — the Cold War — once again split the world into \r\nopposing blocs. After the break-up of the Soviet Union \r\nand the socialist camp, many thought that military \r\nconflicts and the reasons for confrontation between \r\nStates would finally disappear. Alas, those hopes have \r\nnot yet been realized. Unfortunately, we must admit \r\nthat our world has not become more stable, predictable \r\nor comfortable for the majority of people on the planet, \r\ndespite the enormous work and tremendous efforts \r\nmade to implement the large-scale plans of the United \r\nNations.\r\nAt the Summit three days ago we adopted an \r\nambitious agenda for the United Nations for the next 15 \r\nyears in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). That outcome document \r\nfocuses on five strategic areas that are vitally important \r\nfor all of us, namely, people, planet, prosperity, peace \r\nand partnership. Those notions did not emerge from \r\nnowhere. They are a logical continuation of the efforts \r\nmade to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nNevertheless, those efforts now give rise to conflicting \r\nemotions. Yes, there have been certain shifts, including \r\na reduction in global poverty levels, an increase in the \r\nlevel of protection, improvements in maternal and child \r\nhealth, and expanded access to education. \r\nBut despite those achievements, we have to \r\nacknowledge that we have not had a qualitative \r\nbreakthrough for the good of human civilization. \r\nMoreover, we see that the world today is being \r\nengulfed by new challenges, and old problems are being \r\nexacerbated. Those challenges and problems do not \r\nconcern just one area, but rather all the most important \r\naspects of human activity.\r\nFirst, today we are confronted with entirely new \r\ngeopolitical realities and military conflicts. Many \r\nspeakers before me have already mentioned that fact. \r\nUnprecedented tension has arisen in international \r\nrelations. Threats are coming to the fore for which there \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.15\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n15th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 28 September 2015, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nare as yet no answers. Focusing on minor disputes, the \r\nglobal community has overlooked the emergence of \r\naggressive global terrorist groups.\r\nThe entire system of international security is \r\nundergoing a most serious crisis. There is a loss of \r\nmutual trust between global players. There is an \r\nunwillingness to compromise. There is a return to \r\nelements of a bloc-like confrontation that have, in \r\nfact, basically put the world on the brink of a new war. \r\nThere are continuing attempts to impose a particular \r\ndevelopment model on other countries. What does that \r\nlead to? As a result of foreign interference, the export \r\nof colour revolutions and artificial regime changes, \r\ncountries that used to be stable have now been plunged \r\ninto chaos and anarchy. All of that is covered over \r\nwith the gloss of democracy. Instead of the promised \r\ndemocracy and prosperity, people in those countries are \r\nliving through extreme suffering or have been forced to \r\nf lee. Crowds of migrants are besieging Europe today. \r\nAnd that too has now become an acute international \r\nproblem.\r\nToday we are increasingly dependent on each other. \r\nThe actions of one country have direct implications for \r\nthe interests of many others. Invulnerable countries \r\nno longer exist. We must honestly acknowledge that \r\ntoday we do not have an effective system of checks \r\nand balances. The States that claim global leadership \r\ncannot, unfortunately, escape the temptation to use \r\nforce and economic blackmail in order to promote their \r\nown interests. The world has come perilously close to a \r\nde facto renunciation of the principles of international \r\nlaw as they are enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThat is why I am deeply convinced that the \r\nOrganization badly needs a new wide-ranging \r\ndiscussion of the principles for the future coexistence \r\nof States and peoples. I have already mentioned that \r\nbefore, but I want to emphasize once again that the \r\nOrganization must not become a forum for mutual \r\nrecrimination and confrontation among States. There \r\nis no alternative to dialogue. We will have to deal with \r\nour problems collectively. One can of course build new \r\nwalls and draw new dividing lines, but that will not \r\nmake our problems disappear.\r\nSecondly, global economic threats are a serious \r\nchallenge to world stability. Currency wars, sanctions, \r\nthe redivision of commodity markets, unfair \r\ncompetition and other negative phenomena compound \r\nthe global crisis. Attempts on the part of a number of \r\nleading States to solve their problems at the expense \r\nof other countries also add to the confrontation and \r\nthe feeling of estrangement. We can get out of that \r\ndeadlock only through comprehensive cooperation \r\namong the economies of all countries and through the \r\nsearch for the best paths to sustainable development \r\nfor the benefit of the global community, not just for an \r\nindividual country. At the same time, it is important to \r\nsupport the poor and poorest States.\r\nIt is only through common efforts that we will \r\nable to forge a new formula of universal, mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation. Belarus suggests that the idea \r\nof the integration serves as a foundation for such \r\nuniversal cooperation, as one of the more topical trends \r\nof the modern world. Just take a look at how many \r\nnew integration groups have emerged recently. Today \r\nwe talk about the prospects for cooperation between \r\nthe European Union and the Eurasian Economic \r\nUnion, about the large-scale Great Silk Road project, \r\nabout creating the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the \r\nTransatlantic Free Trade zones and dozens of others.\r\nIf we succeed in avoiding unnecessary and dangerous \r\ncompetition among integration models, and instead \r\nmake them compatible with and complementary to \r\neach other, ideally we will establish a global integration \r\nstructure that would cover our entire planet and closely \r\nlink the various regions and whole continents. Such a \r\nparadigm could provide for the peaceful coexistence of \r\nthe various nations and States, united by the common \r\npurpose of progress and prosperity. The value of the \r\nintegration process lies in its democratic nature. To \r\na certain extent, it equalizes the opportunities for all \r\nstakeholders and enables both small and middle-sized \r\ncountries to develop their potential and become an \r\nimportant link in that process.\r\nThe key prerequisite for integration is mutual \r\nbenefit. However, the desire to reap immediate unilateral \r\nadvantages is the root of evil. We need to realize our \r\nresponsibility for the future and think of what we will \r\nleave behind. We must not forget that extreme poverty \r\nin some regions of our planet, outrageous social \r\ninequalities within societies, disproportion among \r\nStates and the lack of opportunities, above all among \r\nyoung people, create fertile ground for international \r\nterrorism and organized crime.\r\nThe social, humanitarian and ecological spheres \r\ncomprise a third cluster of global threats. Of late, \r\nwe have been hearing resounding calls from several \r\ncountries for maximum freedom. Such calls put the \r\n15-29425 3/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nbasic foundations of human society, including such \r\nconcepts as family, morals and virtue, to the test. \r\nIrresponsible social ideas may lead to new divisions \r\namong the various cultures and give birth to harsh \r\nreligious rejection in ethnic conflicts. Have those social \r\ninnovators considered the consequences of their words \r\nand actions, I wonder?\r\nThe same selfish attitude is characteristic of \r\nhumankind’s approach to nature. For many years now, \r\nthe international community has been trying, with \r\nno success, to meet the challenges of climate change. \r\nMany simply prefer to shift the burden of responsibility \r\nonto others, onto the next generation. \r\nThinking about such problems, one cannot help \r\narriving at a certain idea. It seems there is one deep-\r\nrooted source of those crises and challenges. It is an \r\nartificial cult of individual rights and human freedoms \r\nat the expense of collective social interests. Under \r\nthe guise of protecting human rights, advocates of \r\nsuch ideas seek to justify the ousting and overthrow \r\nof Governments, the destruction of States and wars \r\nover resources. Chaos and anarchy are proliferating. A \r\npredatory attitude towards nature and the pursuit of easy \r\nprofits are being fostered. That leads to the degradation \r\nof human consciousness, in which someone’s perverted \r\nwhims are treated as the norm. Such approaches give \r\na green light to social degradation and the decay of \r\nmoral principles and human values. The very boundary \r\nbetween good and evil disappears. \r\nBelarus does not claim to have ready-made recipes \r\nfor resolving those issues, but we sincerely believe that \r\nthe answer lies in the realm of those ideas that were \r\nproposed to the world 70 years ago by the founders of \r\nthe United Nations. First and foremost, I refer here to \r\nthe unconditional condemnation of violence. Wars must \r\nnot be an instrument for settling scores between States. \r\n“Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved \r\nby understanding,” said the wise Einstein. It is hard to \r\nargue with that. It is only through self-restraint that we \r\ncan ensure the well-being and protection of everyone, \r\nthe powerful and the vulnerable alike. That is precisely \r\nthe essence of international law, which is the only \r\nalternative to the law of the jungle.\r\nBelarus will always support any and all efforts \r\nand initiatives aimed at strengthening the system \r\nof international law. That is our key foreign-policy \r\npriority. However, international law alone cannot \r\nsafeguard peace and security globally. What is also \r\nneeded is to create decent conditions of life for every \r\nsingle individual at the national level. I am deeply \r\nconvinced that only a strong State can adequately cope \r\nwith such a task. It is paradoxical that humankind has \r\nentered the twenty-first century with a large number \r\nof failed and ineffective States. What is a failed State? \r\nIt is basically one characterized by the absence of the \r\nrule of law and stability and by glaring inequality and \r\nextreme poverty, the lack of motivation and the absence \r\nof healthy moral values among the young.\r\nWe in Belarus understand that very well. Over the \r\npast two decades, we have been purposefully building \r\na sovereign State with a socially oriented economy. We \r\nhave paid and are continuing to pay the utmost attention \r\nto policies that strengthen the family and help young \r\npeople fully realize their potential. Let me be frank: \r\nwe are very concerned by the ongoing destruction of \r\ntraditional family values that is taking place in several \r\ncountries. We particularly do not like being invited \r\nto accept certain moral deviations and various social \r\ninnovations as natural. I will not to dwell on that \r\nproblem too much. I am afraid that I will get bogged \r\ndown here and will be criticized, but I feel compelled \r\nto ask the following: who will give birth to children? \r\nWe will do everything to ensure that our grandchildren \r\nand their descendants preserve socially nurtured moral \r\nvalues and good traditions of spirituality and culture.\r\nI can assure everyone here with absolute confidence \r\nthat anarchy, lawlessness and violence will never find a \r\nplace on the soil of Belarus, no matter what guise they \r\ntake, including democracy. We are sufficiently strong \r\nand self-assured not to let them in from the outside. \r\nAs before, a stable Belarus will continue to remain a \r\nprovider of regional and international security.\r\nWe intend to build equal, mutually beneficial and \r\nrespectful relations with all countries around the world. \r\nGood neighbourliness and mutual assistance are of \r\nspecial value to us. That is why today we strive for a \r\npeaceful settlement of the crisis in brotherly Ukraine, \r\nas well as in other hotspots on the planet. Belarus will \r\ncontinue to be actively engaged in collective efforts to \r\nmeet global threats and challenges, first and foremost \r\nwithin international organizations. Those organizations \r\nhave invaluable experience, expertise and potential. \r\nBelarus can offer the international community its \r\nexperience, although limited, in tackling a number of \r\nproblems — for example, the Chernobyl disaster and \r\nthe elimination of its consequences, and dealing with \r\nthe issue of trafficking in people. \r\n4/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nThinking about our national developmental \r\nexperience, I can reach the following conclusions. Only \r\nan alliance of strong, responsible and effective States, \r\nunited by the system of international law, can adequately \r\nrespond to modern global threats and challenges. For \r\nthat, the role of the United Nations is crucial.\r\nThese days we hear a lot of criticism about the United \r\nNations. Of course, the Republic of Belarus shares the \r\nkey idea that the Organization cannot remain static, it \r\nshould keep abreast of the times. For us, there is an \r\nobvious need to reform the structures and activities of \r\nthe United Nations while maintaining the inviolability \r\nof the purposes and principles of its Charter. It is also \r\nimportant to understand that the United Nations, as I \r\nhave said on many occasions, is all of us together. The \r\nwell-being of the world community will depend on how \r\ncoordinated and constructive we are.\r\nFar be it from me to want to sound prophetic, once \r\nagain, on the second day of our work, but today one \r\ncannot help feel that we are witnessing the spectre of a \r\nmassive new war. We must not allow that sinister vision \r\nto turn into a reality.\r\nYesterday we discussed very important issues and \r\nthe agenda for the future of the United Nations. But \r\nwhen we talk of sustainable development, that may well \r\nsound like sacrilege to millions of people, both old and \r\nyoung, because they are dying. What we must do is \r\ncome together and adopt one decision, and one decision \r\nonly, namely, to put an end to all wars and conflicts that \r\nhave erupted and are currently ravaging our planet.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to quote another eminent \r\nperson, Nelson Mandela. That unbroken fighter for \r\njustice in the world once said, “Sometimes it falls on \r\na generation to be great. You can be that generation.” I \r\nhope very much that such a destiny will indeed befall \r\nour generation. I am confident that we will find the \r\nstrength and common sense to do whatever it takes to \r\nchange the world for the better. That is the only option \r\nwe have.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Belarus for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Alyaksandr Lukashenka, President of the \r\nRepublic of Belarus, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of \r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Muhammadu \r\nBuhari, President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Buhari: On behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of Nigeria, I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President and his country on his election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly at its seventieth session. \r\nMay I also express appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, and to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon, both of whom worked tirelessly to ensure \r\nthe proper articulation of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and to maintain the focus and commitment \r\nto the ideals of the United Nations. I also thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his recent visit to Nigeria, where \r\nwe held very useful discussions.\r\nFifty-five years ago, almost to the day, my \r\npredecessor, Nigeria’s first Prime Minister, Alhaji \r\nAbubakar Tafawa Balewa, stood in this forum to declare \r\nNigeria’s desire to develop and maintain friendly \r\nrelations with all countries. He also assured the world of \r\nour country’s commitment to upholding the principles \r\nupon which the United Nations was founded.\r\nMy country has lived by that conviction, even \r\nwhen, for instance, judgements went against us in \r\nterritorial disputes with our neighbours. We respected \r\nthose judgements and abided by them as a mark \r\nof respect for the rule of law and the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Nigeria’s record in the service of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations is second to \r\nnone. I myself, as a young officer in the Nigerian army, \r\ndid several tours of duty in the Congo and Lebanon. \r\nNigeria has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nefforts in Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Darfur. \r\nFurthermore, we are proud of our contributions to \r\nother activities of the United Nations, including the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council \r\nand security-sector reform.\r\n15-29425 5/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nWe are gratified to note that most countries have \r\npledged their commitment to the post-2015 development \r\nagenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) contained therein, along \r\nwith their means of implementation. That successor \r\nframework to the Millennium Development Goals has \r\ncome with lofty aspirations and, if I may say so, heroic \r\nassumptions. Nonetheless, the new Goals target broad-\r\nranging development cooperation by the international \r\ncommunity up to the year 2030, and they deserve \r\nuniversal support. That is because the SDGs mirror the \r\nhopes and aspirations of much of the world.\r\nI should stress that for the newly adopted SDGs to \r\nbe truly global, they must be practical. In that regard, \r\nthe Agenda’s core objectives of eradicating poverty \r\nand reducing inequalities must be met within the \r\nframework of revitalized global partnership support \r\nand concrete policies and actions, as outlined in the \r\nAddis Ababa Agenda on Financing for Development. \r\nLuckily, those two core objectives of the SDGs are \r\nprecisely at the centre of the agenda of  Nigeria’s new \r\nAdministration. \r\nIt must be emphasized that foreign direct \r\ninvestment, supplemented, where suitable, by official \r\ndevelopment assistance, as outlined in the Addis Ababa \r\nAgenda, are necessary, though not sufficient, conditions \r\nfor accelerated development in countries that are trying \r\nto catch up. In that connection, I would like to appeal \r\nto industrialized countries to redeem their pledges to \r\ndevote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to \r\ndevelopment assistance. With the sole exception of the \r\nUnited Kingdom, all the countries concerned, so I am \r\ntold, have still to meet that United Nations requirement. \r\nWith the SDGs, we have the opportunity to improve the \r\nlives of people, not just in the developing world but in \r\nall nations.\r\nThe Secretary-General himself has listed six \r\nessential elements for delivering on the SDGs, namely, \r\ndignity, prosperity, justice, partnership, planet and \r\npeople. As a prerequisite to those elements, and as we \r\nlook at history and remember the terrible events that \r\ngave rise to the birth of the United Nations in 1945, \r\nI would like to propose a seventh essential element, \r\nnamely, peace. \r\nPeace is close to the hearts of Nigerians, as we are \r\nin the front line in the war on terror. Boko Haram’s \r\nwar against the people of Nigeria, Chad, the Niger and \r\nCameroon may not attract as much worldwide attention \r\nas the wars in the Middle East, but the suffering is just \r\nas great and the human cost is equally high. This is a war \r\nabout values between progress and chaos. It concerns \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. Boko Haram celebrates \r\nviolence against the weak and the innocent and, \r\ndeplorably, hides behind its perverted interpretation of \r\nIslam. Boko Haram is as far from Islam as can possibly \r\nbe imagined.\r\nMany of my colleagues present in this forum want \r\nto know how our new Government intends to tackle the \r\nhuge problems that we have inherited. Friends of Nigeria \r\nand foreign investor partners will be encouraged to know \r\nthat the new Government is attacking the problems we \r\ninherited head-on. We intend to tackle the inequalities \r\narising from massive unemployment and the previous \r\nGovernment’s policies that favoured a few people to the \r\ndetriment of the many. We intend to emphasize quality \r\ntechnological education for development and lay a \r\nfoundation for the comprehensive care of the aged, the \r\ndisadvantaged and the infirm. But for now, terrorism is \r\nthe immediate problem.\r\nAccordingly, the new Nigerian Government, which \r\nI have the honour to head, has moved with dispatch to \r\nimplement a bold and robust strategy to defeat Boko \r\nHaram. Nigeria and its neighbours — Cameroon, Chad, \r\nthe Niger and Benin — are working together to face \r\nthe common threat within the regional framework of \r\nthe Lake Chad Basin Commission. We have established \r\na multinational joint task force to confront, degrade \r\nand defeat Boko Haram. We have driven them away \r\nfrom many of their strongholds, killed or captured \r\nmany of their operatives and commanders and freed \r\nseveral hundreds of hostages. One of our major aims \r\nis to rescue the Chibok girls alive and unharmed. We \r\nare working around the clock to ensure their safety and \r\neventual reunion with their families. The Chibok girls \r\nare constantly on our minds and in our plans.\r\nTerrorism is by no means the main or the only \r\nevil threatening and undermining the well-being of \r\nsocieties around the world. Corruption, cross-border \r\nfinancial crime, cybercrime, human trafficking, \r\ncommunicable diseases, climate change and the \r\nproliferation of weapons are all major challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century that the international community \r\nmust tackle collectively. I would like to reaffirm the \r\nNigerian Government’s unwavering commitment to \r\nfighting corruption and illicit financial f lows. By any \r\nmeasure, corruption and cross-border financial crimes \r\n6/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nare impediments to development, economic growth and \r\nthe realization of the well-being of citizens across the \r\nglobe.\r\nNigeria is ready and willing to partner with \r\ninternational agencies and individual countries on \r\na bilateral basis to confront crime and corruption. In \r\nparticular, I call upon the international community \r\nto urgently redouble its efforts to strengthen the \r\nmechanisms for dismantling safe havens for the \r\nproceeds of corruption and for ensuring the return of \r\nstolen funds and assets to their countries of origin.\r\nThe world is now facing another big new challenge, \r\nthat is, human trafficking. It is an old evil that has \r\ntaken on an altogether new and dangerous dimension, \r\nwhich threatens to upset international relationships. We \r\nin Africa are grieved to see in the international media \r\nthe hundreds of thousands of our able-bodied men and \r\nwomen who are f leeing to Europe, with thousands \r\ndying in the process in the desert or drowning in the \r\nMediterranean. We condemn in the strongest possible \r\nterms traffickers in human beings and will support \r\nany measures to apprehend and bring them to justice. \r\nAt the same time, we greatly appreciate European \r\nGovernments, particularly those of Italy and Germany, \r\nfor their understanding and humane treatment of those \r\nrefugees.\r\nLast year, our continent faced the dreadful \r\noutbreak of Ebola. We sincerely thank the international \r\ncommunity for its collective efforts to contain that \r\ndeadly disease. We are not out of the woods yet, but \r\nwe would like to express our appreciation to the United \r\nStates, the United Kingdom, France and China, which, \r\nin collaboration with the host countries, provided \r\noutstanding assistance to stop the spread of Ebola and \r\nto care for those infected.\r\nNigeria fully subscribes to and endorses Goals 13, \r\n14 and 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals with \r\nregard to climate change. In Nigeria, desertification and \r\nland erosion and degradation, which lead to biodiversity \r\nloss, are real threats to our environment and, under \r\nthe auspices of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, we \r\nwill propose a regional approach to combating those \r\nenvironmental challenges. In that connection, we look \r\nforward to the twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in \r\nDecember. That Summit should give humankind hope \r\nthat the looming threat faced by many communities \r\naround the world is being addressed.\r\nWe are witnessing a dreadful increase in conflicts \r\nfuelled by the availability of small arms and light \r\nweapons. I call upon all Member States to show the \r\npolitical will needed to uphold the Charter of the United \r\nNations in that regard. For a start, robust implementation \r\nof the Arms Trade Treaty will guarantee that small \r\narms and light weapons are transferred only in a legal \r\nmanner. Arms traffickers and human traffickers are \r\ntwo evil species that the international community needs \r\nto eradicate.\r\nAs we engage in these annual debates, we must \r\nremind ourselves of the principles that led to the \r\nfounding of the United Nations years ago. Among them \r\nare the peaceful coexistence and self-determination \r\nof peoples. In that context, the unresolved question \r\nof self-determination for the peoples of Palestine and \r\nWestern Sahara, both nations having been adjudged by \r\nthe United Nations as being entitled to that inalienable \r\nright, must now be resolved without any further delay \r\nor obstacle.\r\nThe international community has come to pin its \r\nhopes on resolving the Palestinian issue through the \r\ntwo-State solution, which recognizes the legitimate \r\nright of each State to exist in peace and security. The \r\nworld has no more excuses or reasons to delay the \r\nimplementation of the long list of Security Council \r\nresolutions on that question, nor do we have the moral \r\nright to deny any people their freedom or condemn \r\nthem indefinitely to occupation and blockade.\r\nThe United Nations is 70 years old. As the \r\nworld’s forum, it can count many more than 70 major \r\nachievements. It is my hope that in the next 70 years \r\nit will take control of the climate, help to eliminate \r\ncommunicable diseases, eliminate major and local \r\nconflicts and thereby eliminate the refugee problem, \r\ntake major steps towards reducing harmful inequalities \r\namong nations and within nations and, above all, \r\neliminate nuclear weapons.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n15-29425 7/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nAddress by Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic.\r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nBongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese Republic, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bongo Ondimba (spoke in French): This \r\nsession is being held at a time when humankind is facing \r\nnumerous challenges, some more difficult than others. \r\nMigration crises, humanitarian crises, immigration \r\ncrises, deadly conflicts, terrorism, economic crises, \r\nclimate change and pandemics are the challenges we \r\nface. It is obvious that, 70 years after the establishment \r\nof the United Nations, we are increasingly aware of \r\nthe dangers that those situations pose, both for us and \r\nfor future generations. That explains our presence and \r\nactivities here and elsewhere in an effort to coordinate \r\nour many actions. More than ever before, the eyes \r\nof our peoples are on the United Nations. More than \r\never before, our Organization has shown itself to be \r\na unique forum that is universal in nature and where \r\nhumankind’s diverse concerns and aspirations can be \r\nwholly expressed.\r\nThe topic of this session provides us with an \r\nopportunity to take a look at how our Organization \r\nworks. It also affords us a chance to develop forecasts \r\nand new prospects for the Organization’s future \r\nactivities, by basing them on the main pillars of its \r\nagenda, namely, peace, security and human rights. \r\nIt is time to acknowledge the solid nature of the \r\nUnited Nations and its leadership, expressed through \r\nMember States constantly working together to manage \r\ninternational affairs. Together, we organized the fight \r\nagainst poverty and major diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis, malaria, and we are now conquering \r\nEbola. \r\nTogether, we have fought for the rights of vulnerable \r\npersons such as the disabled, the elderly, indigenous \r\npeoples and women and children, including widows and \r\norphans. We should underscore, in passing, that in 2010 \r\nthe General Assembly, on Gabon’s initiative, adopted \r\nthe resolution to establish International Widows Day \r\n(resolution 65/189). We have come together to respond \r\nto humanitarian emergencies, global warming and \r\nother cross-border threats. Together, we are working \r\nto effectively respond to the many security challenges \r\nstemming from terrorism and other cross-border \r\nthreats. Together, we have made progress in the area \r\nof international criminal justice in order to be more \r\neffective in combating impunity. Working together, \r\nwe have also fostered dialogue among cultures and \r\ncivilizations, strengthened relations among the peoples \r\nof the world and lowered identity barriers.\r\nDespite our many efforts, however, international \r\npeace and security unfortunately continue to be \r\nthreatened, as we witness in the emergence of new \r\nchallenges. Our Organization must adopt a new \r\nstructure in order to adapt to the new international \r\nenvironment. New threats have emerged in the form of \r\nterrorism, maritime piracy, trafficking of all kinds and \r\nsmuggling. Such threats call for new kinds of responses. \r\nMy country welcomes the fact that the Security Council \r\nis taking those new threats under its consideration. It is \r\nin that regard that Gabon contributed, when we were \r\na member of the Security Council in 2010-2011, to \r\nadopting a historic resolution on the impact of the HIV/\r\nAIDS epidemic on international peace and security \r\n(Security Council resolution 1983 (2011)). \r\nIn that same vein, I would like to mention the \r\nSecurity Council presidential statement on the illicit \r\ncirculation of small and light weapons in Central \r\nAfrica (S/PRST/2010/6). On the initiative of Gabon and \r\nGermany, the General Assembly adopted, on 30 July \r\n2015, a resolution on illegal trafficking in wildlife \r\n(resolution 69/314). I am delighted at the large number \r\nof sponsors, which reflected an unprecedented level \r\nof support from the international community on the \r\nmatter. That resolution also reflected our willingness \r\nto pool our efforts — countries of origin, transit and \r\ndestination — in order to end that phenomenon. I believe \r\nthat we will be more effective if we work together. \r\nGabon would like to encourage the Organization, \r\nparticularly the Security Council, to continue efforts to \r\novercome those threats, with a view to developing more \r\nsuitable and comprehensive responses to the current \r\nsecurity challenges.\r\nSeveral crises continue in Africa despite the \r\nefforts of the Security Council, the African Union \r\nand subregional organizations. In the Central African \r\n8/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nRepublic in particular, despite the progress made this \r\nyear, the situation remains fragile and a cause for \r\nconcern. Events in recent days have proved that the \r\nstability in the country must be strengthened. We must \r\nredouble our efforts to move towards a transition. I invite \r\nthe stakeholders to exercise greater restraint and to \r\nprioritize dialogue so as not to undermine efforts being \r\nmade to restore peace in the country. The international \r\ncommunity must work together to assist the Central \r\nAfrican Republic in holding elections before the end of \r\nthe year. That country will then be able to put an end to \r\nthe current troubled period in its history.\r\nIn the Middle East, the situation between Israel \r\nand Palestine remains a source of concern. The \r\ninternational community must become more involved \r\nin efforts to resume the peace negotiations. Resolving \r\nother, similarly complex situations in other regions of \r\nthe world has proved that there is no challenge that \r\ncannot be overcome. The establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState remains the only viable prospect for guaranteeing \r\npeace in the subregion. We must work together to \r\nensure that the State of Palestine and Israel can coexist \r\nin peace and mutual acceptance. \r\nI would also like to welcome the positive \r\ndevelopments this year in the relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States of America in the wake of the \r\nnormalization agreement and the establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the two countries. I would \r\nlike to believe that this development will soon result in \r\nthe lifting of the embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe nagging question of the ongoing threat posed \r\nby the excessive accumulation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, including nuclear weapons, can be resolved \r\nonly within the framework of multilateral mechanisms, \r\nsuch as the Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\n(NPT). My country remains firmly committed to the \r\ninternational system of non-proliferation, as enshrined \r\nin the relevant instruments, such as the NPT. That \r\nis why I welcome the recent agreement between the \r\ninternational community and the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran concerning its nuclear programme.\r\nThe terrorist threat continues to expand throughout \r\nthe world. Besides the Middle East, Africa has become \r\na new theatre of operations for a number of terrorist \r\ngroups. In West Africa and Central Africa, the Boko \r\nHaram sect spreads terror and resists countermeasures \r\nby the countries on the front line. In East Africa, \r\nespecially in Somalia, Al-Shabaab commita devastating \r\natrocities and continues to challenge the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia. \r\nIf we are to be more effective in the fight against \r\nterrorism, we must necessarily strengthen international \r\ncooperation. We must pool our efforts to address that \r\nscourge. With good international cooperation we could \r\nbenefit from the increased monitoring of the financial \r\nf lows that fuel the phenomenon. My country reaffirms \r\nits solidarity with all initiatives to combat international \r\nterrorism in all its forms.\r\nThere has been significant and undeniable progress \r\nin the area of human rights worldwide. Through United \r\nNations assistance, political systems have become \r\nopen and national institutions ensuring equality and \r\njustice for all have been put into place within nations. \r\nAt the request of the Member States, the United \r\nNations undertook the reform of the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights and transformed it into the Human \r\nRights Council. The goal was to make the body more \r\nproactive, less politicized and, above all, more effective. \r\nI welcome the part that my country played in that effort. \r\nThe support that Member States gave the Gabonese \r\npresidency of the Council enabled Gabon make \r\nsignificant progress towards achieving the objectives \r\nintended by that reform. I wish to thank Member States \r\nfor that support.\r\nFor my country, the improvement of human rights \r\nmust first be considered from an educational, not \r\na political, point of view. The United Nations must \r\nengage in an ongoing dialogue with Member States to \r\nhelp them overcome the challenges that they face with \r\nregard to respect for human rights. Confrontation in \r\nthat area does not appear to be constructive to me.\r\nThe maintenance and consolidation of peace \r\nnecessarily depends on the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. That ambition also calls for the reform of \r\npeacekeeping operations. Gabon reiterates its support \r\nfor making the Security Council more democratic so \r\nthat it involves all regions when it developments and \r\nimplements its decisions. It is from that perspective that \r\nwe reiterate our full commitment to the African position, \r\nas expressed in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration, and to the ongoing intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the issue. The time is opportune to \r\ntranslate the reform, which has been accepted and \r\ndesired by all, into action.\r\nThe question of the use of the veto is an integral \r\npart of the Security Council reform process. My \r\n15-29425 9/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\ncountry supports the initiative of France and Mexico on \r\nthe rational use of the veto by the Council’s permanent \r\nmembers. \r\nFor several years, peacekeeping operations, which \r\nare the specialized arm of the Security Council, have \r\nbeen the subject of profound restructuring. I welcome \r\nthe recommendations of the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations. I am particularly interested \r\nin the recommendations concerning the use of new \r\ntechnologies and improved communications between \r\nlocal populations and mission personnel, on the one \r\nhand, and between the Secretariat and contributing \r\ncountries, on the other. I also support that sustainable \r\ndevelopment during the post-conflict phase is being \r\ntaken into account.\r\nFurthermore, in order to be more effective, \r\npeacekeeping missions should receive predictable \r\nfinancing and clear mandates of limited duration so \r\nas to avoid their becoming unduly long. In certain \r\ncircumstances, the mandates must be more robust, \r\nespecially when there is no alternative but to impose \r\npeace. In that case, based on Chapter VII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, we should be able to provide \r\npeacekeeping operations with mandates that authorize \r\nthe military to resort to force to impose peace. We must \r\nbe able to give peacekeeping operations the mandate \r\nto create conditions for peace rather than to maintain a \r\nfragile peace framed by a ceasefire agreement.\r\nThe revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly is another aspect of United Nations reform \r\ndesired by the majority of Member States. I welcome \r\nresolution 69/321 on that issue, adopted on 11 September \r\n2015. I am convinced that the resolution will strengthen \r\nthe Assembly, which is the most representative body of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nClimate change, another new threat to international \r\npeace and security, is increasingly affecting our \r\necosystems and the survival of the planet. If we do not act \r\ntoday, the consequences will be devastating — floods \r\nin some areas, droughts in others and even breaches \r\nof the peace in certain cases. My country notes the \r\nrelative progress made in the process of negotiations \r\nin Bonn. However, I note that just two months before \r\nthe upcoming twenty-first Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Paris, those negotiations are far \r\nfrom attaining any preliminary agreement before we \r\nset to work in earnest to conclude an agreement at \r\nthe Conference. The gravity of the situation requires \r\nthat we, leaders of the world, be able to courageously \r\novercome our differences and make every effort to reach \r\nagreement in Paris. The climate situation continues to \r\ndeteriorate.\r\nIn the opinion of the experts, the year 2014 was \r\nthe warmest ever, and everything suggests an increase \r\nof 4°C, 5°C or 6°C in global warming if nothing is \r\ndone today. It is therefore time for us to assume our \r\nresponsibilities and make the right decisions, the \r\ndecisions that our peoples expect of us. It is a question of \r\nthe survival of humankind and the legacy we bequeath \r\nto future generations. Africa and South America, which \r\nare the two lungs of the planet, have a fundamental role \r\nto play in the negotiations. That is why I appeal to the \r\nHeads of State and Government of those two regional \r\npoles to conduct constant consultations during the Paris \r\nnegotiations.\r\nIt is commonly said that climate change has a close \r\nconnection with the migration crisis. The fight against \r\nclimate change will certainly help reduce extreme \r\npoverty. The desired solutions involve, among other \r\nthings, the development of the energy and water sectors, \r\nbut they must also include increased Government \r\ninvestment in such areas as education and professional \r\ntraining. Africa needs electricity and water. Africa also \r\nneeds to create jobs to improve the well-being of its \r\npopulations. Providing responses to the climate change \r\nthrough the development of a new economic model will \r\nenable people to remain in their home countries. It is \r\ntherefore important that the international community \r\nmobilize to set up coping mechanisms to mitigate the \r\neffects of global warming.\r\nSince the Copenhagen Conference, Gabon has, \r\nthrough me, has continued to call for the adoption of \r\na universal and binding agreement on climate change. \r\nThe upcoming Paris Conference in December will \r\nenable us to achieve that vital objective. To achieve it, \r\nwe must avoid the mistakes made in Copenhagen. The \r\ncrucial nature of the Conference is such that it cannot \r\nbe postponed for another year, because what is at stake \r\nis the survival of humankind. If we postpone it, it will \r\nbe too late.\r\nOver the course of recent decades the world has \r\nchanged at a fast pace, an evolution that unfortunately is \r\nin contrast with the inflexibility of the ideas, institutions, \r\nrules and practices that form the framework of global \r\ngovernance. A new architecture whose legitimacy is \r\n10/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nfounded on the participation of all in the management \r\nof the affairs of the world is now necessary. The United \r\nNations must resolutely embark on the path of reform if \r\nit wishes to continue to play a strategic and diplomatic \r\nrole at the highest global level.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nNow that democracy is a cardinal value, the \r\norganization of world affairs should no longer \r\nbe based on the precept of balance of power. An \r\ninternational system based on power, whether balanced \r\nor coordinated, has the disadvantage of promoting \r\nhierarchy and the marginalization of small States and \r\naccentuating the absence of reciprocity. On the other \r\nhand, multilateralism, of which the United Nations \r\nis the guarantor, favours collective security over the \r\nbalance of power, inclusion over selection.\r\nSeventy years after the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, the growing number of its States \r\nMembers shows that the world has definitely opted for \r\nmultilateralism. Such intention necessarily involves \r\nan innovative political plan based on the principles of \r\nequality, inclusion, indivisibility and reciprocity. That \r\nis the primary goal of the United Nations. May the \r\nAlmighty help us to achieve it.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the Gabonese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay.\r\nMr. Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, President of the \r\nRepublic of Paraguay, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Cartes Jara (spoke in Spanish): \r\nSeventy years ago, on the still smoking ruins of the \r\nSecond World War, the United Nations was born, with \r\nthe purpose of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity and promoting cooperation among all the \r\nnations of the world. The Republic of Paraguay was one \r\nof the 51 States that signed the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which has become a historic contribution to \r\nthe international community. For Paraguay, the right to \r\nequality and respect for sovereignty among States, both \r\nlarge and small, justifies the reasonable hope for the \r\nfull strengthening of the United Nations.\r\nI express my best wishes to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for the successful conduct \r\nof proceedings at the current session. I would also \r\nlike to express my singular appreciation for the work \r\nof Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whom we had the honour to \r\nreceive in my country in February. His visit further \r\nstrengthened our connections with, and commitment \r\nto, the Organization and multilateralism. I take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate to the Secretary-General my \r\ngratitude for recognizing the work and results of our \r\nGovernment’s fight against poverty and expressing \r\nhis appreciation of the abundant clean and renewable \r\nenergy that Paraguay is blessed with.\r\nThe strengthening of the Organization should have \r\nas its specific goal the building of a truly fair and caring \r\nworld in which human dignity is universal. That means \r\nrectifying the inequities and inequalities that still cast \r\na shadow on the world order, a feat whose realization \r\nwill depend on the extent to which international law \r\nis complied with and the dream of a peaceful era and \r\nwell-being shared among all our nations is fulfilled.\r\nWith regard to Paraguay, the main objective of our \r\nGovernment is to reduce poverty in the short term in \r\nthe context of a State policy aimed at its eradication. To \r\nthat end, we are maintaining and increasing the scope \r\nof our social programmes, especially those focusing \r\non extreme poverty and providing conditions-based \r\nassistance. We rely on an arsenal of programmes that \r\nprovide opportunities, employment and decent housing \r\nand ensure respect, equity and access to education, \r\nhealth and high-quality utilities as we wage our \r\nunceasing battle to eradicate extreme poverty in our \r\ncountry. These programmes provide comprehensive \r\nand permanent solutions that enable people to become \r\nindependent agents and develop their full potential.\r\nWe seek inclusive economic growth for our \r\ncountry, so that progress reaches all Paraguayans. \r\n15-29425 11/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nWe are encouraged by the fact that Paraguay is one of \r\nthe countries with the highest economic growth rates \r\nin the region. That has been achieved by maintaining \r\nstrict fiscal discipline and by improving our production \r\ncapacity and competitiveness. To the added value of our \r\nraw materials, which requires domestic and international \r\ninvestments, we are exponentially adding that of the \r\nconstruction industry, which is rapidly changing the \r\nprofile of our cities. Similarly, we aim to expand and \r\nmodernize our infrastructure in the conviction that by \r\ntransforming the country, we are reducing poverty. \r\nWe consistently uphold the importance of young \r\npeople. Paraguay is a young country; 75 per cent of its \r\npopulation is below 40 years old. That represents a great \r\ndeal of human capital. I welcome the enthusiasm of \r\nyoung people, in particular Paraguayan students, who \r\nin recent days made a united appeal for transparency \r\nin public administration and for quality education in \r\nParaguay. We have confidence in the immense potential \r\nof our youth, and we firmly believe in the importance \r\nof access to high-quality education if we are to achieve \r\nthe full progress of our nation. That is why we created \r\na scholarship programme, the first phase of which \r\nwill allow 1,500 Paraguayan professionals to complete \r\nmaster’s degrees and doctorates in the best universities \r\naround the world.\r\nOn 17 September, our Government, which is \r\ncommitted to transparency and to fighting corruption \r\nand its corrosive effects on the foundations of society, \r\nenacted the instrument regulating the law on free access \r\nto public information and government transparency, \r\nwhich allows all citizens to exercise their constitutional \r\nright to be informed. We are promoting a culture of \r\ntransparency and, from the beginning of our term of \r\noffice, we have affirmed that what is public should be \r\nin the public domain. \r\nThose national efforts will not be enough without \r\ninternational policies that promote effective cooperation, \r\nfair-minded exchanges and adequate complementarity \r\namong countries and regions. That triad — cooperation, \r\nexchange and complementarity — urgently requires a \r\nnew paradigm, which the United Nations should help \r\nin creating. We are living in the age of globalization. \r\nA few keystrokes and, thanks to technology, the whole \r\nworld is within range. Almost instantly, we are aware of \r\nwhat is happening halfway across the world. Moreover, \r\ntechnology affects us directly and personally. We live \r\nconnected. \r\nWithin that context, how does one board the \r\ndevelopment train? The twenty-first century society \r\nrequires a key asset: human skills. The new challenges \r\nare meant for qualified individuals, and they are such that \r\nfitness for survival is in direct proportion to the degree \r\nof one’s real and effective academic training. Following \r\nthe political and industrial revolutions and, together \r\nwith globalization, the knowledge revolution has taken \r\nplace. This means that the human element remains \r\nthe most important and essential resource, provided \r\nthat people are sufficiently trained. Education is \r\nthe key. Therefore, it is imperative that UNESCO be \r\nstrengthened. Developed countries should be driven by \r\na sense of fairness and moral obligation to increase their \r\ncontributions to its financing. An excellent education \r\nand scientific research should not be the preserve of \r\nsome countries, but rather should be a universal public \r\ngood.\r\nWe witness with great concern today a huge and \r\nendless exodus of families f leeing conflicts. I am \r\nreferring to our brothers in Syria and in other countries \r\nfaced with the violence of radical and intolerant groups. \r\nWe cannot turn our backs on this current human \r\ntragedy. We call on the Organization to appeal to \r\nMember States, in particular the States in the affected \r\nregion, to adopt the necessary measures in favour of \r\nthis extremely vulnerable sector of civil society.\r\nParaguay reaffirms that disarmament, non-proliferation \r\nand arms control are essential factors for international \r\npeace and security and provide the guarantee that the \r\nmost vulnerable countries need in order to ensure \r\nsustainable economic and social development. \r\nWe thank the member States of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency for the confidence they have \r\nshown in Paraguay by unanimously electing it to the \r\nBoard of Governors. As a Governor, we will act with \r\nabsolute impartiality and balance in promoting and \r\nensuring the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nAnother major issue of concern is the preservation \r\nof the environment. Paraguay, like many developing \r\ncountries, gives priority in its national policies to \r\nthe preservation of the integrity and diversity of the \r\nnatural legacy bequeathed to us by our ancestors. We \r\nare aware of the immense responsibility incumbent \r\nupon humankind to safeguard the resources on which \r\nits existence depends. It is with this awareness and \r\ncommitment that Paraguay encourages the rational \r\nmanagement of natural resources and promotes the use \r\n12/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nof renewable sources of clean energy, in harmony with \r\nnature and in pursuit of development.\r\nThe whole world heard the urgent call of His \r\nHoliness Pope Francis, which was repeated last Friday \r\nin the Assembly (see A/70/PV.3). He appealed to us \r\nto protect our common home, to engage in urgent \r\ndiscussions on how we intend to build the future of the \r\nplanet and to unite the whole human family in pursuit \r\nof sustainable and comprehensive development. In a \r\nmasterly fashion, the Holy Father described climate \r\nchange as a global issue with major environmental, \r\nsocial, economic, distributional and political \r\ndimensions, characterizing it as a current challenge \r\nfor humankind and one whose worst impacts would \r\nprobably be felt in the developing countries over the \r\ncoming decades. He went on to say that environmental \r\nand social deterioration had the greatest impact on the \r\nweakest of the planet, and that this inequity affects \r\nentire countries as well as individuals, requiring us to \r\nthink about the issue of ethics in international relations. \r\nIn preparation for the next session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, scheduled for later this \r\nyear in Paris, we must redouble our efforts with a view \r\nto making serious political commitments to mitigating, \r\nalleviating and reversing the devastating consequences \r\nof climate change.\r\nBeing a landlocked developing country, as Paraguay \r\nis, has some adverse effects. To address that situation, \r\nwe are proposing, together with 32 other landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, that the more developed \r\neconomies accord us special and differential treatment, \r\nincluding the removal of high tariffs and non-tariff \r\nbarriers, thereby enabling us to be more competitive.\r\nTrue integration also entails the transfer of \r\nknowledge and capital investment and a balance in \r\nterms of trade and bilateral and multilateral treaties. \r\nThe reduction of asymmetries depends on economic, \r\nsocial and cultural integration, with a view to a common \r\ndestiny, not on draconian policies in which weaker \r\ncountries have to bear the brunt of the burden.\r\nDemocracy is a political system in expansion, and \r\nit is based on the indivisible principles of equality, \r\nfreedom and sovereignty. If we want democracy to \r\nprevail in our own countries, it is only to be expected \r\nthat we would also want to prevail at the United \r\nNations. We must aim at ensuring that democracy, \r\nequity and geographical representation prevail in \r\nits various organs. To that end, Paraguay supports \r\na reform of the Organization that would strengthen \r\nthe General Assembly, the most representative organ \r\nwithin the Organization, and restore to it its legitimate \r\npowers, which must be interdependent with those of the \r\nSecurity Council, in accordance with the terms of the \r\n1945 Charter. \r\nParaguay is following with great interest \r\ndevelopments with regard to the reform and expansion \r\nof the Security Council. We believe that it is necessary \r\nto improve the Council’s working methods and to make \r\nits management more transparent, and that the views \r\nand ideas of non-members of the Council on issues \r\nrelated to international peace and security that will \r\nundoubtedly have an impact on them should be heard.\r\nParaguay welcomes the efforts undertaken by the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of China on Taiwan to \r\nreduce tension across the Taiwan Strait, efforts which \r\nhave contributed greatly to ensuring peace and stability \r\nin East Asia. Our Government advocates continuing the \r\npragmatic dialogue and mutually beneficial interaction \r\nbetween both sides of the Strait, parties that are also \r\nrecognized by the international community.\r\nSimilarly, Paraguay reaffirms its commitment to \r\nsupporting the peace process in the sister Republic of \r\nColombia, initiated by President Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, and hopes that the conflict, which has claimed \r\nthousands of innocent lives, will soon be resolved. \r\nWe welcome the agreement reached on 23 September \r\nin Havana. It signals an important step towards \r\nachieving the long-awaited peace in that sisterly nation, \r\nwhich is linked to my country by honourable historical \r\ntraditions.\r\nThe promotion of human rights is a priority issue \r\nif we are to move towards a more balanced, fair and \r\ndignified world. For us, the rights to freedom, free \r\nassembly, human integrity and quality of life are \r\nessential. So long as there is discrimination, whether \r\nit be racial, religious, political or gender-based, our \r\nhuman rights record will be deficient. It is in the light \r\nof this vision that Paraguay is becoming a first-time \r\nmember of the Human Rights Council, where it is to \r\nbe one of the Vice-Presidents. Owing to the social \r\ndimension that we give to these inalienable rights, we \r\nalso aspire to join the Economic and Social Council for \r\nthe period 2019-2021.\r\nParaguay, with its preponderance of young \r\npeople, is inspired to vigorously promote their active \r\n15-29425 13/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nparticipation in building a more just and free society \r\nand the protection of the rights of children and women.\r\nFate has given us the huge responsibility of \r\ngoverning and representing our nations at a time \r\nwhen international solidarity has become imperative. \r\nParaguay brings from the beating heart of America \r\nits continued and caring commitment to the beautiful \r\n70-year-old dream of strengthening peace and security \r\nin the world. Today’s reality also calls upon us, more \r\nthan ever before, to protect our common home — our \r\ndamaged and mistreated planet. Let us fully meet this \r\nchallenge so that we can bequeath to future generations \r\na world at peace that is fairer, healthier and more \r\ninclusive and is a better place to live.\r\nMay God bless us all. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Paraguay for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Horacio Manuel Cartes Jara, President of \r\nthe Republic of Paraguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nand Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander- in -Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Uhuru \r\nKenyatta, President and Commander-in-Chief of the \r\nDefence Forces of the Republic of Kenya, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kenyatta: It is a pleasure for me to \r\nbe addressing the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. Let me begin by congratulating the President \r\non his election at this historic session. We are confident \r\nthat his vast diplomatic experience will enable him to \r\nsteer the proceedings and contribute to the achievement \r\nof the objectives that he has set. Kenya fully supports \r\nhis leadership and will constructively engage with him \r\nas we strive to realize those objectives.\r\nSeventy years ago, in the aftermath of the Second \r\nWorld War, the United Nations was established with \r\nthe objective of saving succeeding generations from \r\nthe recurrence of war. Thereafter, the world took up the \r\nchallenge of defeating colonialism and its ideologies. \r\nThat era was also seen as the precursor to greater global \r\nequality, increased social equity and the beginning of \r\nthe fight against mass poverty. It also led to the growth \r\nof democracy and freedom.\r\nToday, the seventieth anniversary of the founding \r\nof the United Nations is being celebrated against a \r\nbackdrop of numerous global challenges. The adverse \r\neffects of globalization, the debilitating consequences \r\nof the world economic and financial crisis and the \r\nnegative effects of climate change have increased \r\nthe vulnerability of the global economy and affected \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations to varying \r\ndegrees. Today, as in the past 70 years, the challenges \r\nfaced by developing countries, together with their \r\naspirations, including peace and security, development, \r\nthe protection of human rights, environmental \r\nconservation and global governance, remain as real and \r\nrelevant as ever. They are expected to continue to be the \r\nprimary concerns for a number of Member States over \r\nthe coming years.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity continues to face increasing challenges owing \r\nto the growing intensity and complexity of conflicts \r\nin the Middle East and Africa, especially in the Great \r\nLakes region, the Horn of Africa and the Sahel. The \r\ncontinuing grave security situation in Eastern Africa \r\nand further afield is of particular concern to Kenya, \r\nwhich has continued to invest millions of dollars in \r\nthe maintenance of regional peace and security, while \r\nmany Kenyans have lost their lives in the quest for \r\npeace. We therefore urge the international community, \r\nin particular the Security Council, to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities in such a way as to make a direct impact \r\nin the resolution of those conflicts. \r\nThere is a need to promote peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties for sustainable development, to provide access \r\nto justice for all and to build effective, accountable and \r\ninclusive institutions at all levels, as stated in Goal \r\n16 of the Sustainable Development Goals, in order to \r\nrealize sustainable peace all over the world.\r\n14/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nGlobal terrorism and violent extremism remain a \r\nmajor threat not only to the Republic of Kenya, but also \r\nto the entire world. To date, Al-Shabaab terrorists have \r\nbeen targeting the civilian population in Kenya on the \r\npretext that Kenya has deployed its troops in Somalia. \r\nThe continued threat by Al-Shabaab has had a major \r\nimpact on Kenya’s national security and economy in \r\ngeneral. Kenya therefore calls upon the international \r\ncommunity to take strong and enforceable action in \r\ncombating Al-Shabaab, together with other terrorist \r\ngroups, including foreign fighters. At the same time, \r\nwe must collectively address the radicalization of \r\nyouth as the pipeline for global terrorism, including its \r\nfinancing at the grass-roots level, where most young \r\npeople are radicalized.\r\nSomalia is an important neighbour of Kenya. Kenya \r\nand Somalia share strong historical, cultural and trading \r\nties that have benefited both societies. Somalia remains \r\nof major concern to the international community, and \r\nto Kenya in particular, owing to long-standing crises \r\nand the security situation, which remains a grave threat \r\nto peace and security in the East Africa region and \r\nthroughout the Horn of Africa. While Al-Shabaab’s \r\ncapacity to launch terrorist acts inside Somalia has \r\ngreatly diminished owing to the presence of the African \r\nUnion Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and its troops, \r\nAl-Shabaab’s continued presence in Somalia has a \r\nnegative impact on the security, stability and prosperity \r\nof that country. The Kenya Defence Forces, within the \r\nframework of AMISOM, will continue working closely \r\nwith the Somali National Army. \r\nIn spite of the threat posed by Al-Shabaab to \r\nKenya, we will continue to stand firm in support of \r\nthe Somali Government and the people of Somalia. \r\nWe therefore call on the international community to \r\nsupport the Federal Government of Somalia in securing \r\nits territory. We remain committed, together with other \r\ninternational partners, to providing the necessary \r\nsupport to the Federal Government of Somalia in \r\nimplementing its Vision 2016.\r\nKenya is also preocupied by the emerging \r\ngovernance and humanitarian crisis in South Sudan \r\nin the aftermath of the political crisis that occurred in \r\n2013. The crisis in South Sudan remains an issue of \r\ngreat concern not only to Kenya, but to the region of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) \r\nand to the larger international community. Kenya \r\nwelcomes the recently signed peace treaty, calls upon \r\nboth parties to seek a peaceful solution to the conflict \r\nand urges the international community, especially \r\nthe United Nations, to support the IGAD-Plus peace \r\nprocess and other initiatives geared to the realization \r\nof a comprehensive, just and sustainable peace in South \r\nSudan. That should be achieved through the enforcement \r\nof the peace and security arrangements, support for the \r\ninstitutions of governance and democracy, support for \r\nthe demilitarization of South Sudan and a response to \r\nthe current humanitarian crisis. South Sudan needs to \r\nfind the path of peace, development and reconstruction, \r\nand that needs to happen urgently.\r\nAt the beginning of this millennium we adopted the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs). Since then, \r\nthe MDGs have galvanized and catalysed international \r\naction in support of eradicating poverty and realizing \r\nother social targets. The MDGs demonstrated that a set \r\nof development goals and targets could be important \r\ndrivers of change. Indeed, where successfully \r\nimplemented, the MDGs have had a positive impact on \r\nthe lives of millions of people. But, at best, the results \r\nhave been uneven. Many developing countries remain \r\noff track and have not been able to meet their 2015 \r\ndeadline.\r\nIt was therefore necessary to begin a global process \r\nto shape a new development agenda, with the starting \r\npoint being the unfinished business of the MDGs and \r\nthe creation of a truly transformative and inclusive \r\ndevelopment agenda as was agreed at the 2012 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, held \r\nin Rio de Janeiro. The new Agenda — Transforming \r\nour world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) — therefore seeks to \r\naddress transformative challenges that cut across \r\nthe social, economic and environmental dimensions \r\nof development. But transformative and inclusive \r\ndevelopment does not mean that we can abandon our \r\nresponsibility to support the countries in the greatest \r\nneed. On the contrary, as the international community, \r\nwe must redouble our efforts to ensure that no one is \r\nleft behind and that no country is left behind.\r\nThe year 2015 will be remembered in history as \r\nthe time when it was decided at important conferences \r\nthat the world should be on a sustainable development \r\npath. These began with the third World Conference \r\non Disaster Risk Reduction in March, then the third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nin July, and the General Assembly, with its very \r\nrecent adoption of the new Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), whose ambitious \r\n15-29425 15/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\noutcome has put us on a a new sustainable development \r\npath, with a new set of Goals. The forthcoming Paris \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change is \r\nalso expected to reach an inclusive, balanced, ambitious \r\nand acceptable climate change agreement, including its \r\nfinancing, that, we hope, will this time turn plans into \r\nactions. The Paris Conference must succeed; failure in \r\nthis case cannot be an option. \r\nThe third United Nations World Conference \r\non Disaster Risk Reduction, held in Sendai, Japan, \r\nunderscored the importance of promoting efforts to \r\nreduce disaster risks at the international and regional \r\nlevels, as well as at the national and local levels. The \r\nConference noted that the cost of addressing disaster \r\nrisk remained a huge burden to many countries. As a \r\nresult, efforts to address poverty eradication and food \r\nsecurity, among other challenges, have continued to be \r\nundermined. \r\nGoing forward, the Conference agreed that it \r\nwould be important to mitigate the risks of disaster by \r\nimplementing resilience measures. Member States would \r\nhave to undertake to reduce disaster losses in terms of \r\nlives and the social, economic and environmental assets \r\nof communities. The Conference called for the full \r\ncommitment and involvement of all actors concerned, \r\nin particular Governments, regional and international \r\norganizations and civil society, including volunteers, \r\nthe private sector and the scientific community.\r\nThe Conference also called on Governments to \r\nmobilize the required means of implementation in \r\norder to address disaster risk reduction, which involves \r\nbuilding capacities, especially in defining risk and \r\nmainstreaming risk pricing, in order to inform priorities \r\nin public expenditures. For effective implementation, \r\ncapacity-building should cover enhanced global risk \r\nanalysis and extend to local authorities and others \r\nat the subnational level. In order to address risk \r\nreduction, sound follow-up mechanism for monitoring \r\nand accountability are needed. We are glad to note that \r\ndisaster risk reduction is part of the new Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda.\r\nAt the third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, held in July in Addis Ababa, \r\nimportant decisions were reached to follow up on the \r\ncommitments made in Monterrey and Doha and to \r\nfurther strengthen the financing of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment framework. The Conference outcome \r\ndocument focused on both financial and non-financial \r\nmeans of implementation. The required resources \r\nwill have to be obtained through domestic resource \r\nmobilization, domestic and international private \r\nfinance, business finance and international public \r\nfinance, which includes official development assistance \r\n(ODA).\r\nHowever, domestic resource mobilization remains \r\nkey in raising the resources needed to finance \r\ndevelopment. That means addressing fiscal constraints \r\nin the available fiscal space and strengthening the \r\ncapacities of tax authorities. The non-financial means, \r\nwhich include international trade as an engine of \r\ndevelopment, debt and debt sustainability, and the taking \r\non of system,ic issues, have also to be implemented. \r\nThis being said, the role of ODA remains key to \r\nupholding the credibility of international development \r\ncooperation. It is therefore imperative that development \r\npartners continue to redouble their efforts to support \r\nand finance programmes in developing countries.\r\nKenya places great importance on domestic \r\nresource mobilization to cover both its recurrent \r\nand its development commitments. We have noted \r\nthe importance of public international finance as a \r\ncomplement to domestic public resources, and we have \r\ntherefore put in place a national external resources \r\npolicy with emphasis on sourcing concessional \r\nor semi-concessional support for key projects. To \r\neffectively coordinate the architecture for the delivery \r\nof external aid, we have put in place initiatives to \r\nfully implement the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid \r\nEffectiveness. Kenya therefore remains committed to \r\nadopting appropriate follow-up and review mechanisms, \r\nwhich will ensure that all the means of implementation \r\nare reviewed periodically. Going forward, we need to \r\naddress capacity deficits in key institutions, such as \r\nour national statistical offices, in order to enable them \r\nto capture the timely and reliable data required for the \r\nfollow-up and review process.\r\nI wish to express my appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the successful outcome of the Summit \r\non the post-2015 development agenda. A few days \r\nago, we adopted a bold, ambitious and transformative \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development for the next 15 \r\nyears. This pact was a culmination of more than three \r\nyears of intergovernmental negotiations, which began \r\nwith the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We are glad to note that the Agenda \r\nrecognizes as its overarching goal ending poverty \r\n16/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nin all its forms everywhere. The Goals and targets \r\nset by the Agenda are universal and will apply to all \r\ncountries, while different realities and capabilities are \r\nnevertheless recognized.\r\nThis new Agenda acknowledges that sustainable \r\ndevelopment cannot be realized without peace and \r\nsecurity; at the same time, peace and security will be \r\nat risk without sustainable development. That calls \r\nfor building peaceful, inclusive and well-governed \r\nsocieties, with responsive institutions as the basis \r\nfor shared prosperity. Fundamentally, the Agenda \r\nrecognizes that we cannot reach our development \r\ngoals without addressing human rights and complex \r\nhumanitarian issues at the same time. \r\nThe Agenda addresses the requirements for all \r\nhumankind to be able to live decent lives, free from \r\npoverty, hunger and inequality, with all men and \r\nwomen, girls and boys, able to develop their full \r\npotential. It commits all of us to being responsible \r\nglobal citizens, caring for the less fortunate and for our \r\nplanet’s ecosystem and making action commitments \r\nregarding the climate, on which all life depends. It is \r\nimportant to note that the Agenda received valuable \r\ninputs from civil society, the private sector, academia \r\nand parliamentarians, as well as from millions of people \r\nfrom every corner of the world who shared their vision \r\nof the world we want.\r\nKenya is proud and honoured to have played an \r\nimportant role in the post-2015 development agenda \r\nprocess by co-chairing the Open Working Group on \r\nSustainable Development Goals and by co-facilitating \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. It is now the responsibility of all \r\ncountries to implement this new universal development \r\nAgenda. The relevant means for achieving this have \r\nbeen developed and integrated into the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, to be complemented by the \r\noutcome of the third International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, to which I referred earlier. \r\nImplementation and follow-up will be critical. We \r\nwill therefore need all partners on board to make it a \r\nsuccess.\r\nTo complete our new path to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, all of us in Kenya look forward to the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, to be held in Paris in November and \r\nDecember. COP21 is a crucial conference, during which \r\nglobal leaders will need the political will to reach the \r\nexpected outcome that will enable the Conference to \r\nachieve a new international agreement on climate that \r\nis applicable to all countries, with the aim of keeping \r\nglobal warming below 2°C. We therefore commend the \r\nefforts of France and all others in facilitating the United \r\nNations search for consensus in climate negotiations. \r\nSimilarly, Kenya will continue to constructively engage \r\nto ensure that we reach a meaningful universal climate \r\nchange agreement that takes into account the issues \r\naffecting the developing world.\r\nKenya is happy to note that the efforts to deepen \r\nour regional integration within the East African \r\nCommunity continue to bear fruit. The East African \r\nCommunity remains one of the fastest-growing regional \r\nintegration bodies and we hope this will continue. The \r\nEast African Community is committed to widening and \r\ndeepening cooperation among partner States in political, \r\neconomic and social fields for our mutual benefit. Over \r\nthe years, the East African Community has expanded \r\nits membership from three founding partners to five, \r\nwhich are now Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and \r\nUganda. This signifies a wider market that bears great \r\nstrategic and geopolitical significance and prospects for \r\na renewed and reinvigorated East African Community.\r\nMuch progress has been made and recorded in \r\nthe East African Community since the establishment \r\nof the East African Customs Union in 2005. We are \r\nglad that much more progress continues to be recorded \r\nsince the establishment of the Common Market in 2010. \r\nThe Protocol Establishing the East African Monetary \r\nUnion is already in place and its implementation under \r\nway. We remain committed to fast-tracking the process \r\ntoan East African federation as a demonstration of the \r\ndetermination of the people of East Africa to construct \r\na powerful and sustainable East African economic and \r\npolitical bloc.\r\nMr. Patiño Aroca (Ecuador), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nLooking into the future, the new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development has brought a new dawn for \r\nglobal development. We must collectively avoid the \r\npitfalls of the past 70 years. We must, as a matter of \r\npriority, focus all efforts towards ending poverty and \r\npromoting sustainable peace and security. We should \r\nremain ambitious, yet at the same time practical, in \r\norder to bring real change to the lives of the poor around \r\nthe world, as well as to guarantee the sustainability of \r\nour planet.\r\n15-29425 17/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nKenya will remain robust in the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\nwill build on our experience from the implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). At \r\nthe same time, Kenya will continue to pay special \r\nattention to fundamental sustainable development \r\nissues that were previously left out of the MDG \r\nframework, especially strengthening the means of \r\nimplementation and revitalizing global partners for \r\nsustainable development, as well as the promotion of \r\npeaceful and inclusive societies, which remains critical \r\nto the realization of peace, security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn conclusion, I assure the Assembly that Kenya \r\nremains committed to continuing to play its rightful role \r\nin the global community, remain an anchor of peace and \r\nsecurity in our region, and foster regional, continental \r\nand global cooperation for accelerated economic and \r\nsocial development and prosperity for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence \r\nForces of the Republic of Kenya for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and \r\nCommander- in- Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Macky Sall, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Macky Sall, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sall (spoke in French): Senegal, through \r\nme, warmly congratulates the President and wishes him \r\nevery success in conducting the work of this session. \r\nWe thank his Ugandan predecessor for his service to \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nSeventy years after the creation of our Organization, \r\nwe are walking in the footsteps of the founding \r\nfathers to renew our collective faith in the ideals of \r\npeace, security, development and respect for human \r\nrights. Those values inspire the principal mission of \r\nthe Organization of preserving the world from the \r\nscourge of war, creating the conditions necessary to the \r\nmaintenance of justice, promoting social progress and \r\nensuring a better standard of living in greater freedom.\r\nSeventy years later, that mission has become more \r\nburdensome and our world increasingly complex. \r\nSeventy years on, peace, which is not only the absence \r\nof war, but also development and human security, \r\nremains threatened by extreme poverty, hunger, disease \r\nand the unprecedented degradation of the environment.\r\nIt is Senegal’s hope that the Paris Cl;imate Change \r\nConference will be successful and adopt binding \r\ncommitments to controlling global warming and \r\nmobilizing adequate financial resources and transfers \r\nof environmentally friendly technologies.\r\nWe face other changes, because the world is \r\nstill struggling to overcome the hideous mask of \r\nracism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and violent \r\nextremism. Human beings are being targeted, rejected \r\nand attacked due merely to the color of their skin, their \r\nbeliefs or social background. Migrant workers are \r\nbeing discriminated against and excluded from public \r\npolicies, even though they are contributing by the sweat \r\nof their brow to the prosperity of their host country. No \r\ncountry can be indifferent to the tragedy of war.\r\nAs a welcoming and hospitable country, Senegal \r\nappeals for greater openness and generosity for \r\nmigrants. These are individuals who have been forced \r\nto leave their countries in a quest to save their lives. \r\nIndeed, we face many urgent problems. Nonetheless, \r\nthe promise of a better world is still within our reach, \r\nand we can achieve it if we accept that this is a plural \r\nworld, that all cultures and civilizations are equal in \r\ndignity and that change is the main dynamic that shapes \r\nthe course of history.\r\nOver the years, 142 countries have joined the \r\n51 founding Members of the Organization. Through the \r\nwealth of their contributions and the diversity of their \r\nneeds, Member States confer an unequalled degree of \r\nuniversality upon the United Nations system. The world \r\nin 2015 is therefore not the same as the world of 1945, \r\nand if we wish to keep the promises made in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, we must abandon our old ways of \r\n18/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\ndoing business. Common sense requires that we change \r\nour vision of the present and of the future. That is what \r\nwill ensure that our Organization will remain faithful \r\nto its vocation as the unique hub where our efforts can \r\nwork together towards a common end.\r\nIt makes sense to enlarge the Security Council \r\nto ensure that it ref lects these new realities that we \r\nall represent here. Senegal, which is a candidate \r\nthis year for a non-permanent seat on the Council, \r\nreasserts its commitment to the African Common \r\nPosition on Security Council reform, in line with the \r\nEzulwini Consensus. It makes sense to reform global \r\neconomic and financial governance through a more \r\nequitable representation of the new realities and greater \r\nf lexibility with regard to access to credit, to put an \r\nend to the paradox of resources that are available but \r\nnot accessible. In our mining industries, it makes \r\nsense to establish, along with transparency, codes and \r\ncontracts that are fairer and more equitable, reward \r\nand protect the investor and preserve the interests of \r\nStates and local populations. It makes sense to combat \r\nmore vigorously illicit financial f lows that cost Africa \r\nbetween $30 billion and $60 billion per year — a loss \r\nthat is more than official development assistance. If \r\nAfrica were to receive fair payment for its resources \r\nand recover the equivalent of 17 per cent of those \r\nassets that have been fraudulently invested abroad, it \r\ncould settle the entirety of its debt and finance its own \r\ndevelopment needs.\r\nAs the current President of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), I \r\nam pleased to say that our subregion has continued \r\non the path of progress. Economic growth remains \r\nabove the global average and our democracy, in spite \r\nof everything, is being consolidated. We are also \r\ndetermined to pursue our efforts for peace and stability. \r\nI reiterate the unfailing commitment of ECOWAS to \r\nthe Peace Agreement in Mali, while respecting national \r\nunity and the territorial integrity of the country, and \r\nto a successful transition in Burkina Faso. I call upon \r\nthe international community and the Security Council \r\nin particular, to remain attentive to Burkina Faso. We \r\nalso support Nigeria and other countries in their fight \r\nagainst Boko Haram. We support stable institutions in \r\nGuinea-Bissau. We will also continue to work together \r\nto eradicate the remnants of the Ebola virus in affected \r\ncountries. As Chair of the Oslo Group on foreign policy \r\nand global health, Senegal will hold consultations \r\nduring this session to draw the lessons from this health \r\ncrisis.\r\nAs we move forward on the path of peace, we \r\nmust strive towards a comprehensive, fair and lasting \r\nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict pursuant to \r\nthe vision of two independent States living in peace \r\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders. \r\nThroughout the world, peace is our common good. \r\nAlong with democracy, human rights and cultural \r\ndiversity, it is the corpus of values of the International \r\nOrganization of La Francophonie, of which Senegal is \r\ncurrently holding the presidency. Our commitment to \r\nthese ideals makes Senegal the seventh-largest troop \r\ncontributor to peacekeeping operations among 128 \r\ncountries. It has more than 3,600 troops deployed in \r\neight missions.\r\nLast year, the Security Council established a medal \r\nin memory of my compatriot, the late Captain Mbaye \r\nDiagne, to honour the men and women who, in serving \r\npeace, have demonstrated exceptional courage. As \r\na member of the United Nations Assistance Mission \r\nfor Rwanda, Captain Diagne was killed on 31 May \r\n1994 when a shell exploded as he was returning from \r\none of his many rescue missions in the field. He was \r\njust 36 years old and was ready to go home. Senegal \r\nand his family are proud that his memory will be \r\nhonoured in this manner. We have a wise saying in my \r\ncountry — man alone can save man — that heightens \r\nour sense of human solidarity and fraternity. May the \r\nspirit of Captain Mbaye Diagne inspire our joint march \r\ntowards a better world of peace that is more just and \r\nwelcoming for everyone.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of \r\nSenegal, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President \r\nof the Republic of Mali\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Mali.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\n15-29425 19/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the Republic \r\nof Mali, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Keita (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the Malian delegation, I would first like to \r\nwarmly congratulate the President on his accession \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session. There can be no doubt that his \r\nelection on 15 June not only recognized his qualities \r\nas an experienced diplomat but was also a tribute to \r\nhis country, the Kingdom of Denmark, which has \r\nan excellent relationship with my country that is \r\ncooperative in every way. I would like to assure him \r\nthat my delegation is completely at his disposal in his \r\nefforts to achieve full success for his mandate.\r\nI would also like to express our great appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, our brother Mr. Sam Kutesa of \r\nUganda, for his outstanding and effective conduct of \r\nthe work of the preceding session. In the same spirit, I \r\nwould like to pay tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the eighth \r\nSecretary-General, for his dedication and unwavering \r\ncommitment to peace and security.\r\nBefore going any further, I, like others before me, \r\nwould like to salute the memory of the victims of the \r\ndisaster in Mina, Saudi Arabia, from Mali and other \r\ncountries in the Islamic community. In these tragic \r\ncircumstances, on behalf of the people of Mali, I would \r\nlike to express my deepest condolences to the families \r\nof the victims and wish the injured a speedy recovery.\r\nWe sometimes see coincidences in the history of \r\npeoples and institutions. One such is the symbolism \r\nof today’s date, 28 September 2015, which marks the \r\nfifty-fifth anniversary of the admission of my country, \r\nMali, into the United Nations, pursuant to resolution \r\n1491 (XV), adopted by the Assembly at its fifteenth \r\nsession, and for that I would like to express my \r\nprofound gratitude to the Republic of Tunisia and to Sri \r\nLanka, known then as Ceylon, under the leadership of \r\nMrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike.\r\nBetween 28 September 1960 and today, successive \r\nGovernments of Mali have spared no effort to fashion \r\na better world, free of the spectres of conflict and \r\nwar, whose main victims are women, children and \r\nthe elderly. Coming as I do from Mali, I know of \r\nwhat I speak. In its continuing quest for peace, the \r\nGovernment of Mali, under my authority, has always \r\npreferred the path of dialogue to the language of \r\narms in the multidimensional crisis that we are in the \r\nprocess of resolving. In that regard, the Government \r\nof Mali has always complied with the relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council and the decisions \r\nand recommendations of the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States (ECOWAS), the African Union, \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nIt was as part of that dynamic that I took the \r\ninitiative to engage my Government in the inter-Malian \r\nnegotiations in Algiers, supported by international \r\nmediation that included representatives of the United \r\nNations, under the auspices of Algeria. I am happy to \r\nbe able to commend here the personal commitment \r\nof Algeria’s President, our big brother Mr. Abdelaziz \r\nBouteflika. After eight months of discussion with our \r\nbrothers in the north who had taken up arms, I am \r\nparticularly pleased to present the Agreement for Peace \r\nand Reconciliation in Mali. Arriving at the Agreement \r\nthrough the Algiers process has been difficult, but it is \r\ndone. While not a panacea and not without problems, \r\nthe Agreement gives us a general framework within \r\nwhich we can work towards a lasting and sustainable \r\npeace.\r\nThis consensus peace Agreement, which can \r\nserve as a general framework for every Malian party \r\nin every aspect of life, is the first in Mali’s history. It \r\nrepresents a new social pact for Mali and Malians, and \r\na new collective commitment to peace and concord in \r\nour country. The Agreement has just sealed forever the \r\nreunion of the children of Mali. It is the result of the \r\nwill of all the Malian parties and the commitment of \r\nall involved to reaching the stage we are now in, that \r\nof implementing the Agreement. For us it is a balanced \r\ncompromise that takes into consideration all our \r\nessential and legitimate concerns, including the issues \r\nof Mali’s territorial integrity, national sovereignty and \r\nbalanced development of every region of the country. \r\nThat is what is most important to us and is what the \r\nAgreement grants and guarantees us.\r\nI would also like to express to all those here today \r\nmy country’s commitment and to give our thanks for \r\neveryone’s assistance. Few countries in recent years \r\nhave been on the receiving end of such assistance as \r\nhas Mali in this stage of its national reconstruction. \r\nThat is why we will not drag our feet. We have our \r\nAgreement, and we have now created its implementation \r\nframework, the Comité de suivi de l’accord, put together \r\nimmediately after the signing of the Agreement, which \r\nhas already got down to work. We have taken measures \r\n20/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nto build confidence among all our citizens and to assure \r\nthem of our unflagging commitment to implementing \r\npeace and build a new Mali. Without peace, we cannot \r\nsucceed. We were elected by the people of Mali, despite \r\nthe grave crisis we have endured, specifically to rebuild \r\nour country.\r\nI would also like to say that the people of Mali hope \r\nto be supported in this implementation phase of the \r\nAgreement for Peace. Implementing a peace agreement \r\nis a delicate business, and it needs support. That is why \r\nwe have scheduled a conference in Paris on 22 October \r\nto raise funds for the development of Mali. God willing, \r\nwe will hold the conference and, hopefully, many of \r\nour friends here today who have helped us so much will \r\ncome.\r\nFor its part, the Government of Mali has developed \r\nand submitted to the Comité de suivi a comprehensive \r\naction plan for implementing the Agreement and an \r\nemergency plan for the interim period. I should stress \r\nthat the Comité de suivi has warmly welcomed that \r\napproach. However, it is worth pointing out that signing \r\nthe Agreement is not an end in itself but requires that \r\nwe pool all of our efforts to implement it, and that is a \r\nmajor challenge that we can rise to, God willing. That is \r\nwhy I  repeat my call to come to the conference in Paris \r\non 22 October.\r\nThe Government of Mali reiterates its call to \r\nall signatory parties to the Agreement as well as the \r\ninternational community to pool their efforts and \r\ninformation to expel from the Sahel and Mali’s national \r\nterritory our common enemy, namely, terrorist groups \r\nand narco-jihadists who seek only to satisfy their \r\ncriminal appetites by means of fear and terror.\r\nI welcome the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2227 (2015), which renewed for the third time \r\nthe mandate of the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, whose \r\nremarkable work accomplished to date I salute. I assure \r\nthe Mission of my support and assistance for the success \r\nof our shared mission. On the same note, I want to \r\nexpress the gratitude of the Government of Mali for the \r\ninternational mediation led by Algeria, which included \r\nthe United Nations, the African Union, ECOWAS, the \r\nEuropean Union, the OIC, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, \r\nthe nNiger, Nigeria and Chad. I do not think I have left \r\nanyone out.\r\nI also welcome the role and the decisive contribution \r\nof France in Mali and all the sacrifices made in this \r\nregard. I also welcome the equally important role of \r\nthe United States of America in the peace process. To \r\nall the friendly nations and the international partner \r\norganizations that have expressed solidarity vis-à-vis \r\nMali by sending us their children or their experts to \r\ndefend the values that form the basis  of our humanity, \r\nI renew here the sincere thanks of the Malian people. I \r\nbow reverently — very piously — to the memory of all \r\nvictims, civilian and military, Malian or foreign, fallen \r\non the field of honour in Mali for the defence of human \r\ndignity, freedom and democracy.\r\nI salute and thank UNESCO, under the leadership \r\nof our friend Irina Bokova, for the remarkable work \r\naccomplished to preserve the cultural heritage in our \r\nclosed, revered city of Timbuktu. The fate suffered \r\nby the mausoleums, which modern-day barbarians \r\nconsigned to collective memory, is well known. What \r\nwe saw happen in Palmyra had occurred earlier in Mali, \r\ntogether with the terror that the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) has begun to address. We welcome the \r\nrecent decision by the ICC on this new crime.\r\nWhen representatives of 50 nations signed the \r\nCharter of the United Nations in San Francisco on \r\n26 June 1945 and when Charter entered into force on \r\n24 October 1945, many States here today had not yet \r\nattained independence. We are pleased that, 70 years \r\nlater, the United Nations now has 193 Members, all \r\ncommitted to preserving the ideals of San Francisco, \r\nbased on the three pillars of peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. That is why the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Mali, which I have the \r\nhonour to lead, is pleased with the General Assembly’s \r\nextremely appropriate decision to make the theme of \r\nthe general debate “The United Nations at 70 — a new \r\ncommitment to action”.\r\nThis theme, the choice of which is of proven \r\nrelevance, will undoubtedly permit all world leaders \r\nand lovers of peace, freedom and justice to make an \r\nobjective assessment of the progress the Organization \r\nhas made and to consider the future with a critical \r\neye trained on the difficulties encountered in the past, \r\nparticularly in areas where the United Nations and \r\nthe international community are called upon to make \r\ngreater efforts to meet current and future challenges.\r\nAt this time of reckoning, we welcome the \r\nimportant progress made in implementing the \r\nprovisions of Chapter VI of the Charter on the pacific \r\nsettlement of disputes through negotiation, mediation, \r\nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, all of \r\n15-29425 21/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nwhich have resulted in the prevention, management, \r\nmaintenance and consolidation of peace in the world. \r\nWe also welcome the significant progress achieved in \r\nthe processes of decolonization, disarmament and the \r\npromotion of human rights. Indeed, we appreciate the \r\ntrue value of building agreements under Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter, in particular between the Security Council \r\nand the African Union Peace and Security Council.\r\nWhile these successes show the ongoing relevance \r\nof certain principles set forth in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, we must recognize that their implementation \r\nhas been made possible thanks to the political will of \r\nMember States and the effectiveness of the staff of the \r\nUnited Nations system, including peacekeepers, who \r\nwork tirelessly, under Chapter VII to bring about a \r\nbetter world. I wish to express to all of them the deep \r\ngratitude of the Government and the people of Mali.\r\nIn a constantly changing world, the United Nations \r\nis required to adapt to new challenges. Part of the \r\nlatest dynamic will be the implementation of post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, entitled “Transforming our world: \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, which \r\nwe recently adopted (resolution 70/1).\r\nA perfect example of a country of the Sahel, my \r\ncountry, Mali, has suffered the brunt of the effects of \r\nclimate change because of the fragility of its natural \r\necosystem. The accretion of sand, the drying up of \r\nthe Niger River, and the degradation of the soil and \r\nvegetation cover with unsuspected consequences are \r\nprime illustrations of what we have had to confront. \r\nTherefore, the Government and the people of Mali \r\nstrongly hope that the conclusions of twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held in Paris in December, will lead to the conclusion \r\nof a legally binding agreement for the preservation of \r\nwhat remains of our environment.\r\nIn addition to this major challenge, there is the \r\nneed to promote global economic governance and the \r\nfinancing of development. The results of the third \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development, \r\nheld in Addis Ababa in July 2015, offer hope in terms \r\nof mobilizing the international community to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, consistent with the \r\nMonterrey Consensus of 2002 and the Doha Declaration \r\nof 2008.\r\nAs a landlocked developing country and among the \r\nleast developed countries, Mali welcomes debt relief \r\nfor heavily indebted poor countries and commends \r\nthe countries that have achieved or even exceeded the \r\ntarget threshold of setting aside 0.7 per cent of their \r\ngross domestic product for public aid. That is indeed \r\nto be welcomed. In this regard, I reaffirm from this \r\nrostrum the recognition of my Government of all the \r\ngenerous donors who, in May 2013 in Brussels, were \r\nwilling to commit to the economic recovery of Mali, \r\nthrough pledges totalling €3.5 billion. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to call on countries that \r\nhave not yet done so to keep their commitments with a \r\nview to the effective mobilization of the pledged sums, \r\nbecause sometimes the distance between the cup and \r\nthe lip is great.\r\nWith respect to the sources of innovative financing, \r\nthe Government of Mali supports and strongly \r\nencourages the UNITLIFE initiative based on the \r\nsimple principle of assigning a tiny part of the immense \r\nwealth created by the use and exploitation of extractive \r\nresources in Africa to the fight against malnutrition, \r\nso that the globalization of solidarity responds to the \r\nglobalization of the economy. Through this initiative, \r\nthe Government of Mali plans to collect a percentage \r\nof the revenues from mining, especially gold, for the \r\npurposes of investing the funds in the fight against \r\nmalnutrition in our county, because that will free up \r\nopportunities for tomorrow. Malnutrition affects our \r\nmost vulnerable groups, including the one that will \r\nbear the future — our young people — with all the \r\nevils that it can cause, in particular cretinism, which \r\nno one should wish to have, just when we need to have \r\nqualified, fit-for-purpose human resources.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges in the world today \r\nconcerns international migration, a phenomenon whose \r\nalarming growth can be attributed to poverty, natural \r\ndisasters, man-made catastrophe and, I am sorry to \r\nsay, the cynicism of organized criminals, because \r\ncriminality certainly exists. The evidence lies in the \r\ntens of thousands who are willing to lose their lives \r\nthrough illegal migration in the sands of the desert and \r\nthe depths of the ocean, as we are seeing today in the \r\nMediterranean.\r\nThe comprehensive approach that the delegation \r\nof Mali proposes depends on intensifying the dialogue \r\namong countries of origin, transit and destination in \r\norder to find appropriate solutions capable of connecting \r\nthe requirements of security, development, respect for \r\nhuman dignity and solidarity, which are in fact a single \r\npackage. If we achieve this, migration will take place in \r\n22/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\na humane and orderly fashion, benefiting migrants and \r\nthe countries of origin and destination.\r\nWith respect to security, the United Nations now \r\nneeds to strengthen its tools and mechanisms with a \r\nview to creating a genuine response to the new threats of \r\nviolent terrorism, drug-trafficking and related crimes. \r\nDespite the inroads we have made in the area of peace \r\nand security, it is regrettable that the international \r\narena continues to to be characterized by the increasing \r\nviolence perpetrated or masterminded by terrorist \r\ngroups and narco-jihadists such as Ansar Dine, the \r\nMouvement pour l’unicité et le jihad en Afrique de \r\nl’Ouest, Al-Mourabitoun, the Islamic State of Iraq and \r\nthe Levant, Al-Qaida, Al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram, \r\nwhich is now known as the Islamic State in Western \r\nAfrica.\r\nIt is clearly urgent to bridge the gap between security \r\nchallenges and the United Nations peacekeeping \r\ndoctrine. We should not forget that this doctrine was \r\ndesigned 60 years ago. I wish from this rostrum to \r\nreaffirm Mali’s active support for any initiative to \r\nreform the peacekeeping architecture by incorporating \r\nthat new reality, because no country today can ignore the \r\nfact that terrorism has become a threat to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMali supports all initiatives for peace in the Middle \r\nEast, especially any initiative that would enable the \r\npeople of the region, especially the people of Palestine, \r\nto finally enjoy lasting and just peace through the two-\r\nState solution, which was adopted long ago and should \r\nfinally be realized.\r\nThe Government of Mali also welcomes the \r\nrestoration of normal diplomatic between Cuba and \r\nthe United States of America. I commend the efforts, \r\ncourage and political realism of President Barack \r\nObama and President Raúl Castro Ruz, as well as of \r\nPope Francis. Pope Francis is a man of peace and a man \r\nof heart, as he showed last Friday when he addressed \r\nthe nations of the world from this very rostrum (see \r\nA/70/PV.3). He played a very important role in the \r\nnormalization of relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates, and I commend him for that.\r\nClearly, our Organization has its work cut out for \r\nit. If it did not exist, it would surely have to be created. \r\nReform of the Security Council is another major \r\ntopic of discussion. Security Council reform will \r\ncertainly be one of the most cross-cutting goals of our \r\nseventieth session. Mali supports the African Common \r\nPosition, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration. We will continue to consult with \r\nother regional groups in order to forge the requisite \r\npolitical will to correct the historical injustice to which \r\nthe continent of Africa continues to be subjected by \r\nvirtue of its lack of representation as a permanent \r\nmember and its underrepresentation as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council. That is not normal and \r\nnot right in the case of such an important continent — a \r\ncontinent of the future, as the whole world is well aware.\r\nUnited Nations reform should also include \r\nglobal economic governance in order to make the \r\ninternational financial institutions better able to assist \r\nthe nations of the South to address the challenges of \r\nunderdevelopment. In that regard, I urgently call on \r\nMember States, regional groups and the international \r\ncommunity to tirelessly pursue the constructive \r\ndialogue that has been under way since 2009 so that \r\nUnited Nations reform can finally be achieved. Indeed, \r\nthe amendments to Articles 23, 27, 61 and 109 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, which entered into force \r\nbetween 1965 and 1968, are sufficient proof that reform \r\nof the United Nations is far from being a Pandora’s box \r\nto be feared.\r\nWe must therefore embark on reform with \r\nboldness and good will. Indeed, reform will allow \r\nthe decision-making bodies of the Organization \r\nto reflect its geographical balance and to improve \r\nworking conditions, including the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. A \r\nreformed United Nations would gain credibility in the \r\neyes of international public opinion and its decisions \r\nwould have a greater chance of being accepted and \r\nimplemented.\r\nTo conclude, I reiterate the full commitment of \r\nthe people of Mali to the ideals of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, especially the preservation of future \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mali for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n15-29425 23/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nAddress by Mr. Rafael Correa, Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Rafael Correa, Constitutional President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Rafael Correa, Constitutional President of the \r\nRepublic of Ecuador, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Correa (spoke in Spanish): We \r\npassionately support the proposal of our dear colleague \r\nand friend, President Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera of \r\nCosta Rica, that the next Secretary-General should be a \r\nwoman. Our region is home to such exemplary women \r\nas Michelle Bachelet, Cristina Fernández, Dilma \r\nRousseff, María Emma Mejía Vélez, Alicia Bárcena \r\nIbarra and others.\r\nIt is nothing short of heroic for members of the \r\nAssembly to be sitting here when there were 18 speakers \r\nyesterday morning and 16 in the afternoon, for a total of \r\n34, and we are two hours behind. I thank United Nations \r\nstaff for working beyond the call of duty, but I think it \r\nis time for us to change our methodology, because this \r\ndoes not make much sense. This is the third meeting I \r\nhave attended. It is 9.30 p.m. and I am speaker number \r\n34. If I am unable to move hearts in three minutes then I \r\nam going to move chairs, because people are just going \r\nto get up and leave. So I thank everyone for being here. \r\nThings could have been worse. Evo Morales Ayma \r\ncould have been next. I offer him my fond greetings.\r\nThe United Nations was born on 24 October 1945 \r\nfrom the ashes of the Second World War to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. After the suffering of \r\nthe Holocaust, we thought that peace meant only the \r\nabsence of war, but in the twenty-first century, 70 years \r\nlater, peace should above all mean presence — the \r\npresence of justice, the presence of dignity, the presence \r\nof development. As Gandhi said, “Poverty is the worst \r\nform of violence.” The Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States has proclaimed our region a \r\ncontinent of peace, but the offensive opulence of a \r\nfew coexisting with the most intolerable poverty is a \r\ndaily assault on human dignity. Peace without justice is \r\nnothing more than pacification.\r\nThe 164 million people living in poverty in \r\nLatin America, of whom 68 million live in extreme \r\npoverty, are still waiting for justice, freedom and \r\nreal democracy — not democracy reduced to holding \r\nperiodic elections. Overcoming poverty is the greatest \r\nmoral imperative for our planet, because today, for the \r\nfirst time in the history of humankind, poverty is the \r\nfruit not of scarcity of resources or natural factors but \r\nof unjust, exclusionary systems that are the product of \r\ntwisted power structures. As far back as two centuries \r\nago, the liberal French philosopher Frédéric Bastiat \r\nsaid as much when he denounced the fact that\r\n“When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of \r\nmen in a society, over the course of time they create \r\nfor themselves a legal system that authorizes it and \r\na moral code that glorifies it.”\r\nLet those who want to steal such sublime concepts \r\nas freedom understand that there can be no freedom \r\nwithout justice. And that is not all. In regions with \r\nthe kind of inequality that exists in Latin America, \r\nonly by seeking justice will we achieve true freedom. \r\nTherefore, we must not settle for minimalist goals, \r\nas we did with the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nA perspective based on bare minimums legitimizes \r\nour current reality, which places the beneficiary in a \r\nposition of inferiority with respect to others and makes \r\nno attempt to remedy the distances or power relations \r\nbetween individuals and societies.\r\nAs Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said this \r\nmorning, “our aim is not just to keep people alive, but \r\nto give them a life” (see A/70/PV.13) — a dignified, \r\nfull life with conditions equal to those enjoyed by every \r\nother human being. We believe that the 17 Goals of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) come closer to that aspiration. We are setting \r\nshared Goals not only for life’sfor  minimums but social \r\nmaximums — the sumak kawsay or well-being of our \r\nancestral peoples, which represents a way of living \r\nwith dignity, satisfying basic needs but in harmony \r\nwith oneself, with one’s fellow human beings and with \r\ndifferent cultures, as well as with nature.\r\nHowever, as we said yesterday in this same Hall \r\n(see A/70/PV.10), the absence in the 2030 Agenda of \r\na specific goal on freedom of movement is a highly \r\nregrettable omission. If, on the one hand, we promote \r\nthe free circulation of goods in search of maximum \r\n24/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nprofit, while, on the other hand, we criminalize the \r\nfree movement of persons in search of decent work, we \r\nhave an immoral paradox that is simply intolerable and \r\nunsustainable from an ethical point of view. It is one of \r\nthe biggest contradictions of neoliberal globalization, \r\nwhich seeks not to create global societies but merely \r\nglobal markets and exists only to benefit capital and \r\nnot human beings. The solution is not more borders \r\nbut solidarity and humanity, as well as the creation of \r\nconditions for prosperity and peace that remove the \r\nincentive for migration.\r\nBut there is great news. The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, as their name indicates, place a \r\nmajor focus on caring for the planet. Generally speaking, \r\nthere have been improvements in the efficiency of \r\nproductive process, including a reduction in the \r\nintensity of global energy. In other words, the quantity \r\nof energy required for one unit of production registered \r\na 1.2 per cent drop between 1971 and 2009. But despite \r\ntechnological advances and the dematerialization of the \r\neconomy, there is ever greater consumption of global \r\nenergy. Emissions have multiplied by a factor of 3.6 \r\nin 50 years, which translates into an annual average \r\ngrowth of 2.6 per cent. If that trend continues, in 28 \r\nyears current emissions will have doubled. The evidence \r\nsuggests that energy consumption and the generation of \r\nemissions are directly proportionate to income levels, \r\nwhich allows consumption to trump efficiency. The \r\ninhabitant of a wealthy country produces 38 times more \r\ncarbon emissions than someone who lives in a poor \r\ncountry, all of which leads to the principle of shared \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities.\r\nOf course, there are also environmental effects \r\nlinked to poverty, such as soil erosion and the lack \r\nof proper solid waste treatment, inter alia. Another \r\nproblem is that the gap in energy efficiency between \r\nrich and poor countries remains abysmal and continues \r\nto grow over time, having increased by a factor of 4 to 5 \r\nbetween 1971 and 2010. Overcoming such gaps depends \r\non access to knowledge, science and technology. Here, \r\ntoo, there is a huge disparity between rich and poor \r\ncountries. Rich countries file 1,360,000 patents every \r\nyear, while all the poor countries combined file only \r\n9,170 patents.\r\nGlobal inequities are reflected not only in the \r\ndistribution of emissions, but also in the impact of \r\nglobal warming and climate change. Countries like \r\nEcuador contribute less than 1 per cent of total carbon \r\nemissions, yet they suffer the effects of climate change. \r\nFor example, the only penguin that lives directly on the \r\nequator — spheniscus mendiculus, commonly known \r\nas the Galapagos penguin — is endangered due to the \r\nwarming of surface marine waters. It is therefore vital \r\nto move towards a universal declaration on the rights \r\nof nature. The primary universal right of nature should \r\nbe for it to continue to exist, but it should also be able \r\nto continue to provide our societies with the necessary \r\nsustenance to enable them continue to live according to \r\nsumak kawsay. That should be a core idea for avoiding \r\ncertain forms of fundamentalism. The human being \r\nis not the only important being in nature, although he \r\nremains the most important. \r\nNevertheless, in spite of those common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and the role played \r\nby access to knowledge, science and technology, \r\nparadoxically, there is now a new unjust international \r\ndivision of labour. Rich countries generate knowledge \r\nthat they privatize, and many poor or middle-income \r\ncountries produce environmental goods that are \r\nconsumed for free. Knowledge in general is a good \r\nthat enjoys free access — in other words, exclusion \r\nis technically impossible or very costly. To avoid free \r\naccess, to privatize that good, institutional barriers are \r\nraised, namely, intellectual property rights. \r\nThe countries of the Amazon Basin also produce \r\nfree-access goods, in this case environmental goods \r\nthat regulate the global climate and without which life \r\non the planet would worsen considerably. Despite that, \r\nthe big global polluters pay nothing for consuming \r\nthose environmental goods and services. Sometimes it \r\nis thought that the generation of environmental goods \r\nhas no cost. The reality is that it can be very costly, not \r\nin terms of direct costs but in terms that what we are \r\nrenouncing to continue those environmental goods: the \r\nopportunity cost. \r\nBy the way, today many demand that we should \r\nnot exploit the oil in the Amazon, without citing any \r\nmoral grounds for that assertion. But that involves a \r\nhuge cost in terms of non-received income, and for \r\nevery passing day it means a child is unable to go to \r\nschool, a community goes without drinking water or \r\npeople are dying due to perfectly avoidable illnesses, \r\ntrue pathologies of misery. If we were compensated for \r\nthe consumption of environmental goods, we would no \r\nlonger need financing for development.\r\nConservation is another fundamental idea for \r\nany debate on sustainability. In poor countries — or \r\nin countries with poor people — conservation would \r\n15-29425 25/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nnot be possible if it did not generate clear, direct \r\nimprovements in the standards of living of the \r\npopulation. As Pope Francis said in his encyclical \r\nLaudato si’, a true ecological approach always becomes \r\na social approach. Access to science and technology is \r\nvital for poor countries in their struggle against climate \r\nchange and poverty. As Paraguay’s President, Horacio \r\nManuel Cartes Jara, said moments ago, it is vital to \r\ndeclare technologies that mitigate climate change and \r\ntheir respective effects as global public goods and to \r\nguarantee their free access. \r\nThe new international division of labour is a \r\ncomplete paradox. The goods of free access should \r\nhave no rival in terms of consumption; they should have \r\nno marginal cost if they are consumed by an additional \r\nperson. As a result, when more people use that good, the \r\nbetter. That is normally the characteristic of knowledge, \r\nscience and technology. As George Bernard Shaw once \r\nsaid very rightly, if you have an apple and I have an \r\napple and we exchange these apples, then you and I will \r\nstill each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I \r\nhave an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of \r\nus will have two ideas. \r\nContrariwise, when a good becomes scarce or \r\nis destroyed little by little as it is consumed, as is \r\nthe case with environmental goods, that is when the \r\nconsumption should be restricted to avoid what Garrett \r\nHardin called the tragedy of the commons. Why is not \r\nthe obvious being done? Indeed, why is the complete \r\nopposite being done? It is not a technical problem, but \r\na political one. The unjust new international division \r\nof labour is nothing other than the distorted logic of \r\nprivatizing the benefits and socializing the losses. \r\nNothing justifies that approach, just power. \r\nJust imagine for a moment that the situation was \r\nreversed: the generators of environmental goods \r\nand services were the rich countries, and the poor or \r\nmiddle-income countries were the polluters. Is there \r\nany doubt that by now they would not have invaded \r\nus to demand from us “fair compensation”? This is \r\nan impressive difference, but the problem of climate \r\nchange only be controlled with simply more justice, \r\nin this case environmental justice. Unfortunately, as \r\nThrasymachus said more than 2,000 years ago in his \r\ndialogue with Socrates, justice is nothing other than the \r\nadvantage of the stronger. \r\nAt the end of 2015 we will meet in Paris for the \r\ntwenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nIf we fail at that meeting and do not reach binding \r\nagreements to protect the only planet that we have, our \r\ncivilization could start to be buried. But if we gain a \r\nvictory we will celebrate twenty-second conference \r\nwith an environmental manifesto that was first written \r\nin 1225 by Saint Francis of Assisi, who expressed \r\ngratitude for Brother Wind, for the air, the sky, the \r\nclouds, the serene heavens and all time.\r\nEcuador looks on with hope at the restoration of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America. We hope that that process leads to \r\nthe lifting of the embargo and the closing of the base at \r\nGuantánamo. It will not be a concession of any power, \r\nrather it will be a triumph of justice and dignity of the \r\nCuban people. I was saddened to hear President Obama \r\nsay that he proposed ending 50 years of embargo not \r\nbecause it was a violation of international law, of the \r\nrights of the Cuban people, of human rights, but because \r\nit had not functioned. There is no concession on that: \r\nwhat we are talking about is the justice and dignity of \r\nCuban people after 50 years of heroic resistance. \r\nOur peoples will never again accept trusteeship, \r\ninterference or intervention. Seared into our memory \r\nare the abuses and violence of the past, even though we \r\nare asked to forget them and to look only to the future. \r\nEcuador supports Argentina in its sovereign right \r\nto the Malvinas Islands, a disgraceful and completely \r\nunacceptable vestige of colonialism in the twentieth \r\ncentury. \r\nWe recognize the State of Palestine. It should be \r\na State Member of the Organization, a fully f ledged \r\nMember within its 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. \r\nWe welcome the recent agreements reached between \r\nthe Colombian Government and the Revolutionary \r\nArmed Forces of Colombia. Ecuador hopes for peace \r\nfor Colombia, and we support them in that endeavour.\r\nEcuador also expresses solidarity with the Syrian \r\npeople, the victim of a conflict that has destroyed \r\nfamilies, goods and people. Certain Powers ignored the \r\nprinciple of non-interference in foreign affairs and have \r\nonly exacerbated the violence. We hope that peace will \r\nbe restored for the Syrian people, and we reiterate that \r\nonly they can decide on their own future. \r\nEcuador profoundly values its relationship with \r\nAfrica and will be hosting the fourth Africa-South \r\n26/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nAmerica Summit in May 2016, to which all the countries \r\nof the two regions have been invited. In October 2016 \r\nwe will be hosting the United Nations Conference on \r\nHousing and Sustainable Urban Development, which is \r\nheld only every 20 years. A new urban agenda will be \r\ndrafted at that meeting, and we firmly believe in the \r\nright to inclusive cities with sustainable urban growth.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncondemn once again before the world an environmental \r\ndisaster that was 85 times worse than the British \r\nPetroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and \r\n18 times worse than the Exxon Valdez spill off the coast \r\nof Alaska in 1989. I am referring to the contamination \r\nleft behind by the Texaco oil company, which maintained \r\noperations in the Ecuadorian Amazon until 1992 and \r\nwas bought by the multinational oil company Chevron \r\nin 2001. Chevron, the third-largest company in the \r\nUnited States, was sued approximately 20 years ago by \r\nindigenous communities of the Amazon who had been \r\naffected by the pollution. It is a strictly a private civil \r\ncase, Amazon Defence Coalition vs. Chevron-Texaco.\r\nChevron spent the previous decade fighting to \r\nkeep the case from being tried in New York, where the \r\ncompany has its corporate headquarters, preferring to \r\nhave it adjudicated where the offence was allegedly \r\ncommitted, in the province of Sucumbios in Ecuador. \r\nNevertheless, as Chevron lost the case and was ordered \r\nto pay a large sum, it has spent 10 years destroying the \r\nreputation of the same courts that it had enthusiastically \r\ndefended when it thought that it could buy them off, \r\nwhile spending hundreds of millions of dollars in a \r\nglobal campaign to discredit Ecuador.\r\nTransnational corporations must cease their abuses \r\nagainst the States and peoples of the South. Ecuador calls \r\nupon Member States to participate in drafting a binding \r\ntreaty to sanction transnational corporations when they \r\nviolate human rights or pollute the environment.\r\nWe invite those present to visit Ecuador and put \r\ntheir hands into the hundreds of pools left by Texaco, \r\nso that they can feel for themselves the oil waste that \r\nwas left behind, 20 years after the oil company left our \r\ncountry. That is the dirty hand of Chevron.\r\nFaced with Chevron-Texaco’s arrogance, its billions \r\nof dollars and the infamy of this corrupt and corrupting \r\ncompany, Ecuador will fight back with the most lethal \r\nof any weapon ever invented: the truth.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nConstitutional President of the Republic of Ecuador for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Rafael Correa, Constitutional President of \r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President of \r\nthe Plurinational State of Bolivia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): I am \r\nenormously happy to be here, on behalf of the Bolivian \r\npeople, to express our feelings and to talk about our \r\nexperiences and our actions to date. As everyone \r\nelse has mentioned, we are here on the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The \r\nOrganization was founded to seek peace after the two \r\nWorld Wars. \r\nI feel it is important to make an in-depth economic, \r\npolitical, social, cultural and environmental assessment \r\nfollowing 70 years of the existence of the United \r\nNations. What has it achieved? In the eyes of the \r\npeople, wars and invasions continue even after 70 years \r\nof the United Nations. What is the cause of those wars \r\nand invasions on several continents? It is due to the \r\nambition of some regions and nations and to policies \r\nthat concentrate capital in only a few hands and in only \r\nsome countries, which are administered by oligarchies \r\nalong with transnational companies. I therefore feel \r\nthat, 70 years after its founding, the United Nations has \r\nnot fulfilled its goals of peace and stability in the world.\r\nThis morning we heard various statements. \r\nStarting with President Obama (see A/70/PV.13) and \r\nthen other Presidents from other continents, all of us \r\nare seeking peace. But I want to say to everyone here, \r\nrepresentatives of all the peoples of the world, that \r\nthere will be no peace without social justice. Calls were \r\n15-29425 27/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nmade against terrorism and armed insurgent groups on \r\nseveral continents — that they have never been able \r\nto understand their demands — while certain Powers \r\nwant to understand how those problems can be solved. \r\nI also heard statements condemning social movements \r\nand confusing them with terrorist movements. I came \r\nout of social movements and the indigenous movement. \r\nThose of us from social movements are not terrorists, \r\nbut rather contribute to social peace with results, as \r\nwell as equality, dignity and justice.\r\nI also want to say to those who have championed \r\ncapitalism for the past 70 years that capitalism has \r\nfailed. It is a failed model because, as many also said \r\nthis morning, it has brought humankind only crises \r\n—humanitarian, financial, energy and food crises. \r\nThe common thread of the various statements was \r\nthat nearly half the inhabitants of the world are going \r\nhungry and that untold billions of dollars in economic \r\nresources are being devoted to destroying Mother \r\nEarth — or Planet Earth, as it is called in the West. \r\nSome have said that $100 billion is needed to confront \r\nand reduce global warming. Has it occurred to anyone \r\nhow much money is being spent to destroy the planet, \r\nand how many countless billions are spent to invade \r\ncountries?\r\nI listened intently to the words of my brother \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, as he despaired \r\nat what the Libyan and Syrian peoples were going \r\nthrough. What is the cause for their suffering? Let us \r\nnot forget that the United States Government overthrew \r\nAl-Qadhafi. This morning they called him a tyrant: the \r\nmilitary intervention by the United States and NATO \r\nwas to target the tyrant, the President at the time. But \r\nMr. Al-Qadhafi was not really the target. The goal was \r\nLibya’s oil. I ask members to ask themseles to whom \r\nLybia’s oil belongs. Does it belong to the Libyan people \r\nor the Libyan State? Or does it belong, in fact, to a few \r\nAmerican and European transnational corporations? \r\nImagine: they used fallacious arguments to intervene \r\nand, now that the poor Libyan people have been torn \r\napart, they are no longer interested in them, for the \r\neconomic and natural resources are now in the hands of \r\nthe transnationals. That is capitalism.\r\nI could speak about the many countries that were \r\ntaken over before and since the founding of the United \r\nNations, not to mention the situation in Syria and other \r\ncountries. That is why we are convinced that capitalism \r\nis not the solution for life, and even less for humankind. \r\nThat is the profound difference between us.\r\nSome presidents at times speak in half-truths here; \r\nthey do not speak the truth about what is happening in \r\nthe world. While some may think that they are going \r\nto live better, such apolicy is not going to resolve \r\nsocial problems or humanitarian issues. Living well, \r\nas our brother the President of Ecuador says, is the \r\nvery synthesis of community-based socialism, while \r\nliving better is the synthesis of capitalism. There is a \r\nprofound difference between the two. By living well I \r\nmean living in solidarity and in complementarity — not \r\njust in solidarity with other human beings, but living in \r\nharmony with Mother Earth. For us in social movements, \r\nespecially the indigenous movement, it is about Mother \r\nEarth. We are convinced that the human being will be \r\nunable to live without Mother Earth, and that Mother \r\nEarth would get along better without human beings.\r\nThere is one other thing that many may not \r\nunderstand, but I still want to say it. Under this way of \r\nliving, basic services cannot be under private business. \r\nThat comes from our significant experience. Basic \r\nservices were once privatized in Bolivia — water, \r\nenergy, electricity and telecommunications. Through \r\nour Constitution we decided that basic services were a \r\nhuman right and could never be private businesses. For \r\nwe are talking about water, which is life.\r\nAlso with respect to living well, we are convinced \r\nthat natural resources can never belong to foreigners \r\nor to transnational corporations. Let me comment from \r\nmy own experience. After coming to power, we heard \r\nfrom the vigorous voices of my people and social forces \r\nin Bolivia. On 1 May 2006, in due homage to workers, \r\nwe nationalized the fossil fuel industry and recovered \r\nour natural resources. During the campaign we said \r\nthat there could be no masters or owners, and maybe \r\njust partners. \r\nI shall give just one statistic in that regard. Prior \r\nto our taking office, income from oil leases stood at \r\nbarely $300 million. Since the law on hydrocarbons \r\nwas changed and we nationalized the industry, that \r\nincome had risen to $5.6 billion by 2014. Imagine \r\nhow much money was stolen from us in Bolivia under \r\nimperial domination and the neoliberal model. We went \r\nfrom $300 million in 2005 to $5.6 billion in 2014. For \r\na country of 10 million inhabitants, those economic \r\nresources are exceedingly importance for economic \r\nfreedom. \r\nThat is why we are convinced that natural \r\nresources should belong to the people and be under \r\n28/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nthe administration of the State. That is our experience \r\nand that is how we have freed ourselves economically. \r\nThat is why we do not believe in capitalism. Why the \r\ninterventions into other countries? To take dominion \r\nover natural resources so that they can then continue to \r\nconcentrate capital in the hands of a few.\r\nSecondly, let me also say that we will face a huge \r\nresponsibility in December in Paris concerning the \r\nenvironment. As Presidents — at least as I see it — it \r\nwill be important that we take with us proposals from \r\nour peoples. After consulting my brothers and sisters \r\nin Bolivia, we will take with us policies, projects and \r\nprogrammes aimed at cleaning up and healing Mother \r\nEarth. If we do not take on the responsibility for \r\nsaving Mother Earth, future generations will hold us \r\nresponsible.\r\nI will mention another personal experience, and I \r\napologize for speaking even more about myself. When \r\nI travel to the countryside in Bolivia, one can no longer \r\ntell what season it is. A friend from the tropics called \r\nme at one or two in the morning one day and asked \r\nwhat I was doing. I said that I was in bed, and asked \r\nthe same question in turn. He told me he was leaving \r\nthe house to go to the river because it was too hot to \r\nsleep, and of course they still had no shower. The entire \r\nfamily was going to the river at that hour to protect \r\nthemselves from such a high temperature. The current \r\nincrease in global temperature is less than 1°C; what \r\nwill happen if the temperature rises 2°C? Some experts \r\nhave predicted that, if we do not stop global warming, \r\nby 2030 the temperature could rise 4°C or 5°C. \r\nI feel that future generations will become \r\nanti-imperialists and anti-capitalists because that is \r\nthe legacy of capitalism. Northern countries are now \r\ntelling us that we should be the stewards of the forests \r\nfor them. But we are not going to be their stewards, \r\nand they should not transfer their obligations and \r\nresponsibilities to us in developing countries.\r\nSo that is another responsibility we have. We must \r\ngo to Paris bearing our awareness of the responsibility \r\nto find a way to save Mother Earth. I invite participants \r\nto attend the international event of the worldwide \r\nsocial movement that will be held in Bolivia from \r\n10 to 12 October, and to bring with them the proposals \r\nand ideas of their peoples. We need not be subjected \r\nto the initiatives of the American empire or of the \r\nmultinationals. Now is not the time to be pursuing alien \r\npolicies.\r\nToday I heard two very interesting and very different \r\nstatements: one by President Obama and the other by \r\nthe President of China. What did President Obama say \r\nto us about providing security to his country and to his \r\nallies? What did he say about combating terrorism? He \r\nsaid that he could provide war and interference. What \r\ndid the President of China offer us? Assistance and \r\ncooperation. That State is not an expansionist one. \r\nI commend social movements. Our movements \r\nengender unity and integration for liberation, not \r\ninvasion policies for the purposes of domination. We \r\nhave profound differences. We welcome the words \r\nof the Chinese President, who again has offered us \r\nassistance and cooperation. We acknowledge his \r\ncountry’s leadership. From the media, we are also \r\naware that the United States is in hock to China. Well, \r\nthat is their problem. I hope the press is not lying. But \r\nthey still threaten interference as a way to dominate the \r\npeoples of the world.\r\nThere is a debate under way. Some this morning \r\ntalked about democracy. I would say that there are two \r\ntypes of democracy. There is the democracy of the \r\npeople and there is the democracy of transnationals. The \r\ndemocracy of the people involves the social movements \r\nin which people organize themselves. But what does \r\nsocial movement democracy consist of? We do not just \r\nhave representative and participatory democracy. In my \r\nexperience, first as a union leader and now as President, \r\nwe have always taken decisions with the leaders. There \r\nhave always been differences: some sectors are more \r\nambitious than others, and some of their demands can \r\nbe both unattainable and undesirable. But the people \r\nunderstand. Policies are decided and programmes \r\nproposed in a joint manner. Our responsibility lies in \r\nhow to meet the demands and carry out the economic \r\nand social proposals and programmes.\r\nIn the other type of democracy, which is \r\nsupposedly representative, voting ends on the day of \r\nthe elections. But who governs then? Let us be honest. \r\nIt is not President Obama who governs, but the bankers, \r\nbusinessmen and transnationals who govern. What \r\nkind of democracy is that? They deceive the people into \r\nvoting, and then they do not govern. I heard a candidate \r\nsay in the media that he financed both Republicans and \r\nDemocrats: “I command them”. That is not democracy; \r\nthat is capitalism. Humankind faces serious problems. \r\nThat is why we are convinced that, if we want to end \r\npoverty, we need to end the capitalist system. There is \r\nno other way.\r\n15-29425 29/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nMoreover, I am also convinced that the new \r\nmillennium should be a millennium of the peoples, not \r\nthat of hierarchies or monarchies. However, I respect \r\ntheir rights. If monarchy is their way, we respect that. \r\nBut it cannot be monarchy exported from Europe to \r\nLatin America. That must end. This is not the time for \r\noligarchies, and much less the financial oligarchies \r\nthat exist today. That is why we have an obligation to \r\nwork together to combat the problems we face. While \r\n70 years after the inception of the United Nations there \r\nmay no longer be coups d’état and military takeovers, \r\nwhat we now have are soft coups, espionage and the \r\nstopping of presidential planes. I do not understand \r\nthese times. Now there are military bases. That is why, \r\nhonestly, I do not share such policies.\r\nI do not know the degree of certainty or resolve \r\nwith which they said it, but those detained for their \r\nopposition in the past have expressed the notion \r\nthat ideas could not be imprisoned. We see so many \r\nterrorists, criminals and corrupt presidents who \r\nviolate human rights — after killing 30, 40, 50 or \r\n70 people — coming to the United States. If we are \r\nfighting against terrorism, crime and drug traffickers, \r\nwhy are those drug-traffickers, terrorists and corrupt \r\npoliticians who violated human rights not thrown out \r\nof the United States and tried in their own countries? \r\nI cannot comprehend how the United States has \r\nbecome a graveyard for corrupt people and criminals, \r\nbut that is what has happened. And some authorities \r\nand Governments wonder why they do not agree with \r\nimperialism and capitalism.\r\nI also want to take this opportunity to address the \r\nserious issue of migration, which I did not hear other \r\nPresidents mention. Migrants are being criminalized \r\nand deported. I speak as an inhabitant of Abya Yala, \r\nour home continent called America. Europeans invaded \r\nus 500 years ago. Did my grandparents criminalize \r\nthose who invaded us? But they put in place policies \r\nto exterminate indigenous peoples. They pillaged our \r\nnatural resources. Yet there were never provisions \r\nor programmes in place to expel them. Some of our \r\nbrothers are today leaving Latin America for Europe or \r\nthe United States to work, and are finding themselves \r\ncriminalized and persecuted.\r\nMoney has its tax havens under capitalism, while \r\nhuman beings suffer hellish poverty, and migrants are \r\nexpelled. That is why we propose to work together to \r\ncreate universal citizenship. We all have a right to live \r\nwherever we wish in the world. Globalization should \r\nnot simply be a matter of trade and money, but it \r\nought be for all human beings around the world. Our \r\nbrother migrants should never be expelled. On its part, \r\nBolivia never deports anyone. Our companies are now \r\nno longer the masters or the owners, now they simply \r\nprovide services in our country.\r\nThe important issue of drug trafficking is another \r\nlegacy of capitalism. We have nationalized the fight \r\nagainst drug trafficking and, in cooperation with several \r\nSouth American countries, have also regionalized \r\nthe effort. It is very important to be aware of United \r\nNations statistics. Drug trafficking has been guided by \r\npurely geopolitical interests. Look at the United Nations \r\nstatistics. Look at those of South American countries and \r\nto those on other continents. What are the results where \r\nmilitary bases are set up and many billions of dollars are \r\ninvested? Zero. Instead, drug trafficking has increased. \r\nAfter having genuinely nationalized, we in Bolivia are \r\nbetter off without military bases, the American Drug \r\nEnforcement Administration or the economic resources \r\nthat the United States should provide as part of a shared \r\nresponsibility. I am not calling for such aid, but we \r\nwelcome Europe’s unconditional contribution to the \r\nfight against drug trafficking. We see the results of the \r\nfight against drug trafficking.\r\nI wish to reiterate that we countries with \r\nanti-imperialist Governments are accused of not \r\ncomplying with certain regulations and of being drug \r\ntraffickers, while pro-imperialist and pro-capitalist \r\ncountries, where drug trafficking has increased, are \r\ncongratulated for their efforts. What a lie! I am not \r\ncomplaining, but I would simply ask members to take a \r\nlook at the United Nations statistics on the fight against \r\ndrug trafficking. \r\nFortunately, other countries have already \r\nunderstood the results we have achieved in Bolivia, \r\nand we are now debating the model of combating drug \r\ntrafficking in Bolivia. We never said that we would \r\nattain zero coca production, but also that we cannot \r\nbe free cultivation of coca. If we had more technology, \r\nsuch as radars, the results would be much better than at \r\npresent. I inherited from the former Government more \r\nthan 30,000 hectares of coca leaf plantations. This year, \r\nwithout the death of a single peasant, we have 24,400 \r\nhectares for traditional consumption. Look at the \r\nUnited Nations statistics and at those of other countries \r\nof the world.\r\nI join the many other presidents in welcoming \r\nthe agreement between Cuba and the United States of \r\n30/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nAmerica to establish diplomatic relations. But I have \r\nsomething I would like to share with everyone, and I \r\nhope that I am not tiring members. \r\nWhen I took up my functions of President, I visited \r\nthe Ambassador of the United States of America, \r\nwhen we still had an Ambassador. He was giving \r\nme instructions: “President Evo, you cannot have \r\ndiplomatic relations with Cuba, Venezuela or Iran.” \r\nThen a group of United States Congressmen came \r\nand they instructed me, “President Evo, you cannot \r\nhave relations with those three countries.” Of course, I \r\nrefused. I said, “If we had the economic resources, we \r\nwould have Embassies in every country of the world. No \r\none is going to tell me with whom I can and cannot have \r\ndiplomatic relations.” Since then, I have never accepted \r\nthe instructions of the United States authorizing or not \r\nauthorizing me to have diplomatic relations with Cuba \r\nor Iran. But now I congratulate the United States of \r\nAmerica for having diplomatic relations with Iran and \r\nCuba, and hopefully soon they will even have relations \r\nwith Venezuela.\r\nDiplomatic relations with Cuba should not end with \r\njust an exchange of Ambassadors. Our great dream as \r\nthe Bolivian people is that the United States will return \r\nGuantánamo to Cuba and that the economic blockade \r\nwill be lifted once and for all. We hope that the words \r\nwe heard this morning from President Obama will be \r\nfollowed up with action to lifte the economic blockade.\r\nPresident Castro, my brother, rightly said that with \r\nthe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates we have declared a zone of peace. We might have \r\na little problem in Colombia with the Fuerzas Armadas \r\nRevolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) but, fortunately, \r\nthanks to the support and mediation of Cuba, we were \r\nvery pleased to hear about the preliminary agreement \r\nbetween FARC and the Government of Colombia. We \r\ncommend the efforts and patience of President Santos \r\nCalderón in reaching that agreement. But I want to \r\nsay to my FARC companions that we have had 50, 60, \r\n70 years of revolutions with arms and bullets; now a \r\nrevolution is achieved through the vote, awareness and \r\nthe democratic struggle. That is our experience. \r\nChange can be made to the social and economic \r\nsituation, not only here on this continent but also on \r\nother continents. When groups or social sectors are \r\nin the right and fight for the dignity and sovereignty \r\nof the people, people support that struggle, that quest \r\nto achieve liberation. We genuinely welcome that \r\nagreement. \r\nThere is another issue in our continent, that of the \r\nMalvinas Islands. With apologies to Argentina, however, \r\nthe Malvinas Islands do not just belong Argentina, but \r\nto all Latin America. How can they control an island \r\nthat is so many thousands of kilometres away, and so \r\nnear to our continent? That has to end. We hope for \r\nunderstanding in putting an end to such problems that \r\nwe continue to have. \r\nWe also have another pending matter, at The Hague. \r\nI welcome the presence of my Chilean brothers, who \r\nare filming me and listening attentively. One hundred \r\nand thirty-six years ago, through no fault of the Chilean \r\npeople, a group of oligarchs, supported by British \r\nmultinationals, invaded us for economic reasons. Just \r\nto refresh members’ memories, the invasion began on \r\n14 February 1879. The first resistance took place on \r\n23 March, after more than a month of invastion. I want \r\nto highlight this: after many commitments and offers \r\nfrom Chile, which I commend, I very much regret to \r\nsay that none have been fulfilled.\r\nThat is why we turned to the International Court of \r\nJustice, because Bolivia is a peaceful country under its \r\nConstitution. We do not have an expansionist mentality \r\nthat makes us want to invade neighbouring countries. \r\nThat is why we are petitioning the Court. Unfortunately, \r\ncertain Chilean officials — not all — say they have \r\nno pending issues with Bolivia. Recently, the Court \r\nsaid there was a pending issue in our continent and it \r\ndeemed itself competent to resolve the case between \r\nChile and Bolivia. It is with humility and great dignity \r\nthat Bolivia welcomes that the fact that the Court has \r\nacknowledged a pending case, as this is the world’s \r\nhighest judicial body, created by the United Nations. \r\nI want to say to my Chilean brothers, and especially \r\nthe Chilean people, that we do not want there to be any \r\nwinners or losers. All we want is to resolve the question \r\nthrough dialogue and for the good of our peoples. That \r\nour great desire as Bolivians. It is not a matter of pitting \r\nanyone against each other. We are two neighbours, two \r\nbrothers. How could be at odds all life-long? All we \r\nwant is for what has been on offer to be fulfilled. \r\nI welcome the support of everyone. I very well \r\nunderstand the great solidarity that exists on this \r\nmatter, and not only on the part of former presidents, \r\nGovernments, social movements and institutions. Kofi \r\nAnnan, a former Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, gave his timely support to the case, saying \r\n“resolve the matter of access to the sea”. Not just Pope \r\nFrancis, but John Paul II also expressed his support. \r\n15-29425 31/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nIt is a matter of record. Four former United States \r\nPresidents and three Nobel Peace Prize laureates said \r\nthat the issuse of access to the sea should be resolved. \r\nThis is not just a claim, but our right. Sooner or later, \r\nas a matter of justice and with the support of the entire \r\nworld, we will return to the Pacific with sovereignty. \r\nWe hope that it will be through an agreed dialogue, for \r\nthe good of all our peoples.\r\nI want to conclude by commending the work of \r\nthe United Nations. Two weeks ago, we found out \r\nfrom the media that the Ambassadors and Government \r\nrepresentatives from all over the world had adopted \r\nthe principles and values  of the Andean indigenous \r\nmovement: do not steal, do not lie and do not be idle. \r\nThose are values from my family. I as President, as well \r\nas the Vice-President and Cabinet, apply those values. \r\nThat is why we have moved ahead in such little time. \r\nBolivia is no longer as it was before. We came to \r\npower when Bolivia was ranked the second-to-last \r\ncountry of the continent, the last country in South \r\nAmerica. Thanks to the struggle of the Bolivian people, \r\nto our social movements and to the programme now \r\nin place, Bolivia is no longer a poorly viewed, small \r\ncountry, as it was before. I referred to our policies \r\nbriefly a few moments ago. Those three values should \r\nthe standard for transparent and honest governance in \r\nthe service of our peoples throughout the world. In the \r\nname of the indigenous movement of Bolivia and the \r\nAndean region, we are happy and grateful to the United \r\nNations for having endorsed those values.\r\nI also want to take this opportunity to commend and \r\nshow my estimation for the joint efforts undertaken by \r\nArgentina, the Group of 77 and the General Assembly \r\nfor adopting the Basic Principles on Sovereign Debt \r\nRestructuring Processes (resolution 69/319) and the \r\nnecessary limits on the voracious transnational vulture \r\nfunds. Such funds are yet another means to strangle and \r\nsuppress the economies of sovereign countries, which \r\nwe reject categorically. That is a way of defending the \r\neconomic sovereignty of countries.\r\nLastly, I thank Pope Francis for everything \r\ncontained in his message. My mother raised me to be \r\nCatholic. Unfortunately, because of the shortcomings \r\nof some leaders of the Catholic Church, I have been \r\ndisappointed by it. Because of Pope Francis, a brother \r\nwho questions capitalism and does not submit to the \r\ngod of money, my morale has been uplifted, and I feel \r\nmore Catholic today. And so I want to commend Pope \r\nFrancis’ message of peace. I now really do have a Pope. \r\nI know that Pope Francis, through masses and religious \r\nceremonies, sends us his blessings and prayers. Because \r\nfor the sake of life and for the sake of peace he is risking \r\nhis life, we have the obligation to defend and help him. \r\nThat is all I ask.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nConstitutional President of Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief \r\nExecutive Officer of Afghanistan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Chief \r\nExecutive Officer of Afghanistan. \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive Officer of \r\nAfghanistan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive Officer of \r\nAfghanistan, and inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\nMr. Abdullah (Afghanistan): It gives me great \r\npleasure, on behalf of the Islamic Republic of \r\nAfghanistan, to express my sincere congratulations \r\non the President’s well-deserved election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I \r\nalso express my deep gratitude to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his hands-on leadership of the \r\nOrganization at a very demanding time.\r\nThe state of the world today, 70 years after the \r\nfounding of this unique Organization, is at best a \r\nmixed one. While the newly drafted Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations asserted its primary principles as the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security after \r\nthe Second World War, today a set of threats, mostly \r\ncreated by humans, challenges societies throughout \r\nthe world and pose a threat to security, basic rights, \r\ndignity, our ecosystem, health care, State viability, \r\ngovernance, national and community cohesiveness \r\nand even cultural and religious identity. However, it \r\n32/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nalso poses a serious challenge to the United Nations \r\nexisting mandate, structure, resources and traditional \r\napproaches to dealing with global issues. \r\nThe Organization has tried its best to keep up with \r\nand adapt to an evolving environment, but if we look \r\nat the past seven decades, we see that our predecessors \r\ndid their best to deal with a litany of conflicts, arms \r\nraces, social and economic upheavals, ideological \r\ncontests and geostrategic rivalries. But never has the \r\nworld or the United Nations faced such fast-paced \r\nchange, both constructive and harmful. Such abrupt \r\nf luctuations heighten expectations and immediate \r\ndemands for solutions and answers. Those monumental \r\ntasks — coupled with population growth, unprecedented \r\nmobility, connectivity and access to information \r\nand technological know-how — necessitate constant \r\nnegotiations, legal frameworks and new management \r\nand leadership skills. They also encompass inherent \r\nrisks and security concerns.\r\nAt the same time, as the world shrinks and the \r\nhuman village grows, we are faced with the ugly \r\naspects of globalization and inter-dependence. We \r\nare seeing the emergence of societies of haves and \r\nhave-nots, subgroups, disenfranchised communities, \r\nabject poverty, upscale corruption, injustice, repression, \r\nsectarianism, terrorism and criminality, among others. \r\nAt some point, it is the United Nations and other \r\nspecialized and multilateral organizations that will \r\nneed to be ready to drive the agenda and provide the \r\nrequired platform for decision-making. We urge future \r\nreforms to take the needs of our times into account and \r\nto offer f lexibility and fast-track problem management \r\nfor the work at hand. \r\nAllow me to dwell on the case of my own country \r\nas a prime example of a nation in transition, as well as \r\nof a country exposed to multiple risks and threats at \r\nthe forefront of our fight against international terrorism \r\nand extremism. Afghanistan is suffering, and its \r\npeople demand solutions that are practical, verifiable \r\nand durable. The presence of terrorist sanctuaries and \r\nsupport networks in Pakistan continues to cause trouble \r\ninside Afghanistan. The Haqqani Network has been \r\nidentified as a main culprit. It needs to be dismantled, \r\nas has been our demand in the past.\r\nOur demands are legitimate, as our people continue \r\nto suffer at the hands of terrorist elements who cross \r\ninto Afghanistan and indiscriminately victimize our \r\ncitizens. That matter needs to be addressed on a bilateral \r\nbasis and facilitated by trusted international partners. \r\nAs a case in point, over the past 48 hours, hundreds of \r\nmilitants, some of whom are foreign fighters, organized \r\nattacks in Kunduz province, where heavy fighting is \r\nraging. The day before, more than 10 spectators at a \r\nsports stadium were killed and many more were injured \r\nin Paktika when a bomb was detonated.\r\nThose attempts will fail to subdue us, just as they \r\nfailed to do so on other occasions over the past few \r\nyears. In the broader context, Afghanistan continues \r\nto be the victim of terrorist organizations and violent \r\nextremists, including Daesh-type cells that are trying to \r\nfind a foothold. Another fact is clear to Afghans across \r\nthe board, namely, were it not for an external support \r\nsystem, access to arms and munitions, rest areas and \r\nhospitals and funding and training, as part of strategic \r\ncollusion with powerful elements in our neighbourhood, \r\nthis guerrilla-style low-intensity warfare would have \r\nbeen history by now.\r\nWe call on Pakistan to do what its leadership \r\npromised to us a few months ago when they agreed \r\nto crack down on known terror outfits, meaning the \r\nenemies of Afghanistan. We agreed to a paradigm \r\nchange in our relations and engagement towards peace \r\ntalks with the Taliban. Events turned out differently \r\nafter it was divulged that the Taliban leader had been \r\ndead for over two years and the episode was a sham. A \r\nloss of trust can have irreparable consequences for all \r\nsides. We need to learn from that. \r\nWe have reached the one-year mark for the \r\nanniversary of the national unity Government. I \r\nam delighted to report to the General Assembly that \r\nAfghanistan has achieved significant milestones in \r\nthe past year. Thanks to the exemplary generosity of \r\nour friends, the progress made in Afghanistan over the \r\npast 14 years cannot be discounted. We succeeded in \r\nprioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable, improving \r\nliving standards, providing access to education to \r\nboys and girls and improving health-care quality. Life \r\nexpectancy has increased by an average of 20 years \r\nsince 2001, with Afghans living well beyond the mere \r\n40 years of age that was once the norm. Improvement \r\nin the health of women and children is particularly \r\nnotable, as illustrated by the 54 per cent increase in \r\nthe number of infants delivered and the 62 per cent \r\ndecrease in infant mortality.\r\nThanks to the Government’s focus on gender \r\nequality, equity and equal opportunity, female political \r\nparticipation has also been strengthened. During the \r\n2014 election, 35 per cent of voters were females. \r\n15-29425 33/34\r\n28/09/2015 A/70/PV.15\r\nWomen now claim 11 per cent of judgeships, with an \r\nadditional 20 per cent in training. \r\nMoreover, we are also strengthening laws \r\nand regulations that deal with torture, and we are \r\ntaking necessary measures to prevent and prosecute \r\nindividuals involved in any form of torture, as per the \r\nOptional Protocol to the Convention against Torture.\r\nWe sincerely thank the international community \r\nfor the exemplary support it has provided and for the \r\ngenerosity and patience it has so tirelessly bestowed \r\nupon us as a war-torn nation. I would very especially \r\nlike to mention the United States of America, NATO, \r\nthe European Union and the entire donor community \r\nfor the blood of their soldiers, the sacrifices of their \r\ncivilian workers and their expertise and encouragement.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the recently escalating \r\nsecurity issues have slowed down State-building \r\nand overall progress. But, through their patriotism \r\nand resilience, our national security forces have \r\ndemonstrated their readiness to face the challenges \r\nposed by the Taliban and their terrorist and violent \r\nextremist groups. Furthermore, President Ghani and \r\nI prioritized a comprehensive reform agenda to root \r\nout corruption from our society and institutions and \r\nto promote transparency and efficacy at all levels of \r\nGovernment, the judiciary and at the national and \r\nsubnational levels. An important component of our \r\nreform agenda concerns necessary changes in the work \r\nof our electoral institutions to strengthen the credibility \r\nand integrity of our future elections. In that respect, the \r\nreform commission recently presented a comprehensive \r\nset of recommendations, and we plan appropriate steps \r\nto implement them. We are confident that those efforts \r\nwill go a long way in the consolidation of participatory \r\ndemocracy in our country.\r\nIn addition to security challenges, the menace \r\nof the illicit drug trade in Afghanistan is having an \r\nadverse impact on the economy and society. However, \r\nwe have a new comprehensive action plan to combat \r\nthe drug economy more effectively. We appreciate the \r\ncontributions made by donors, especially the assistance \r\nprovided by the United States. We are determined to \r\nmeet the 10-year-long goal of defeating narcotics once \r\nand for all.\r\nRegional cooperation on the drug problem is \r\nanother key pillar of our strategy. Beyond cooperation \r\non counter-narcotics, the unity Government is \r\ncommitted to enhancing regional engagement and \r\nbuilding constructive relationships based on win-win \r\nformulas, and turning Afghanistan into a connectivity \r\nhub for energy, trade, transit, transport, pipelines and \r\nfibre optics. The sixth Regional Economic Cooperation \r\nConference on Afghanistan, held in Kabul recently, \r\nagreed to work on ways to develop and consolidate \r\npartnerships towards promoting regional economic \r\ncooperation and integration in Afghanistan and across \r\nthe region. Success stories are already taking shape, such \r\nas the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Transmission \r\nand Trade Project and the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline, \r\nturning Afghanistan into a land bridge connecting \r\nChina and India through South Asia and Central Asia \r\nto the Middle East and Europe.\r\nMy Government has a strong political will \r\nto implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) with the support of the \r\ninternational community, while we implement the \r\nremainder of the Millennium Development Goals and \r\ntargets. \r\nI would like to add Afghanistan’s voice in support \r\nof a reformed Security Council that is more inclusive, \r\nrepresentative and transparent. Like most Member \r\nStates, we agree that the Security Council is in dire \r\nneed of comprehensive reforms to better confront \r\ntwenty-first century challenges.\r\nMy Government supports the inalienable rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people. We reiterate our long-standing \r\nposition that a two-State solution offers the best \r\nguarantee for long-term and sustainable solutions to \r\nthe conflict. \r\nIn addition, I would like to express my strongest \r\ncondemnation of the terrible acts against humanity \r\ncommitted by all sides in Syria, especially the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and Shams. The people of Syria and Iraq \r\nare suffering. As a war-ravaged country, we feel their \r\npain, dispossession and trauma. I call upon the global \r\ncommunity to take prompt and urgent action and to \r\nfacilitate a political solution through talks.\r\nWe look to the United Nations to remain beside us \r\nfor years to come on our journey into the transformation \r\ndecade. As we move forward, we expect a strategic \r\nrealignment in the support role of the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations. In that regard, we \r\nwelcome the outcome of the work of the tripartite review \r\ncommission to determine the guiding principles of the \r\nUnited Nations future engagement in Afghanistan.\r\n34/34 15-29425\r\nA/70/PV.15 28/09/2015\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate my Government’s \r\nsteadfast commitment to promoting the very principles \r\non which the United Nations was founded. We are \r\nconfident that, with the continued support of the family \r\nof nations represented in this noble Organization, we \r\nwill realize our shared goal of a peaceful, stable and \r\nprosperous nation that is a catalyst for security and \r\nprosperity in our region and beyond.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe Chief Executive Officer of Afghanistan for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdullah Abdullah, Chief Executive Officer of \r\nAfghanistan, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.50 p.m.\r\n"
