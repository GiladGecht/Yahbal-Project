Ending extreme poverty \r\nwas never going to be enough to fulfil our ambitions. \r\nThis new compact is about prosperity, and it recognizes \r\nthat the only sustainable future is one that includes all \r\nof us. It could hardly be otherwise. The creativity and \r\ndynamism of billions of people is already transforming \r\nour world for the better. That is thanks to improved \r\nhealth, education and access to new technologies and \r\nto empowering women to take their rightful place in \r\nthe world.\r\nBut growth and progress also raise new challenges \r\nrelated to international migration, the protection of the \r\nenvironment and demands for good governance. For the \r\ngeneration to come, responding to those challenges will \r\nput the United Nations at the centre of global affairs \r\nas never before. Cooperation is the only way forward. \r\nAnd yet the new consensus on sustainable development \r\nis incomplete, because it lacks a shared definition \r\nof the political legitimacy required to sustain that \r\ninternational order.\r\nThat divergence of visions is rooted in history. \r\nWhen world powers created the United Nations \r\n70 years ago, independence for the colonized peoples \r\nof Africa and Asia was not on the agenda. We were still \r\nseen as people who needed to be looked after. Those \r\nmoral hierarchies and prejudices are still with us, \r\ncontributing to the mismanagement of political change \r\nand corroding the trust on which effective multilateral \r\ncooperation depends.\r\nThe internal character of national systems counts \r\nfor everything. It cannot be bypassed. Political \r\nlegitimacy is not a legal abstraction. It is an objective \r\nreality that can be measured, for example, in terms of \r\nprogress towards the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nas well as in terms of indicators of public opinion. We \r\nface serious challenges that we must confront together \r\nas an international community. We cannot afford to \r\nundermine the most responsible and capable members \r\nby applying standards to some countries that are not \r\napplied to others, and even by imposing inappropriate \r\nones.\r\nTo take just one example, international refugee \r\nlaw has barely been a factor in the current crisis, as \r\nif the purpose all along was more to keep refugees \r\nencamped far from developed countries than to protect \r\nthe rights of people f leeing persecution. In other cases, \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.16\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n16th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 29 September 2015, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

When matters \r\nof principle become associated with domination and \r\ndisdain, the basis for joint action in the multilateral \r\nsystem is compromised.\r\nWe have nothing to fear from high standards. \r\nThe only stability worth having is one based on good \r\npolicies that deliver real results for citizens and facilitate \r\npeaceful change. Human dignity and even survival are \r\nimplied in that. No country or system has a monopoly \r\non wisdom, much less a claim to moral superiority. \r\nOur task is to settle the future, not the past. Change \r\nis coming, and it is necessary. No one can manage it \r\nalone, and the Sustainable Development Goals rightly \r\nrecognize our mutual interdependence. We have made \r\ngood commitments; now we must make good on them. \r\nBuilding a community with a shared purpose that \r\nis capable of doing so starts with recognition of our \r\nequality.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Rwanda \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Paul Kagame, President of the Republic of \r\nRwanda, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. David Arthur Granger, President \r\nof the Republic of Guyana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Granger: The Cooperative Republic \r\nof Guyana is honoured to participate in this historic \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election, \r\nand pledge Guyana’s cooperation as you guide the \r\nAssembly in the fulfilment of its tasks. We would also \r\nlike to thank your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for \r\nhis stewardship in piloting the post-2015 agenda. That \r\nprocess has culminated in the historic 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The \r\nSustainable Development Goals it contains reflect the \r\ncommon consensus within the international community \r\non the elements that are integral to human development.\r\nThe United Nations, established 70 years ago and \r\na mere five months after the formal end of the Second \r\nWorld War, became the midwife of a new international \r\norder. That new order of world peace was depicted \r\nsymbolically and powerfully in the form of a bronze \r\nstatue on the grounds of the Headquarters of the United \r\nNations. It embodies the vision revealed in the Holy \r\nBible in the Book of Isaiah that states,\r\n“And he shall judge among the nations, and \r\nshall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their \r\nswords into ploughshares, and their spears into \r\npruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against \r\nnation, neither shall they learn war any more.” (The \r\nHoly Bible, Isaiah, 4:2)\r\nThat prophetic verse became the philosophical basis of \r\nthe United Nations, which became the organizational \r\nfoundation for a global order that saw the emergence \r\nof a plethora of newly independent States, a result of \r\nthe decolonization process after the Second World War. \r\nIn the years since its establishment, 126 States have \r\ngained their independence.\r\nThe United Nations began in 1945 with a \r\nmembership of only 51 countries, but today that has \r\nalmost quadrupled to 193. The majority of new States \r\nare mini-, micro- and small ones. The undemocratic \r\nand warlike empires of which they were colonies \r\nwere dismantled after two world wars. These are the \r\nquestions that small States ask of the United Nations \r\non this, its seventieth anniversary: How will our \r\npeoples be protected from foreign aggression? How \r\nwill our territories be safeguarded from invasion? How \r\nwill peace among nations be preserved? How will the \r\nindependence of the new States be sustained? The \r\nCharter of the United Nations charges our Organization \r\nwith the responsibility\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes”.\r\nThat responsibility is essential to the existence and \r\nsurvival of small States that are threatened by more \r\npowerful ones. They risk being subjugated unless \r\nthe international community can demonstrate a \r\n15-29431 3/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\ncommitment to providing an effective deterrent against \r\ntheir domination by larger, stronger States, and the \r\ncapability to do so.\r\nOn 9 May 1994, at its forty-ninth session, the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted resolution 49/31, which, \r\namong other things, recognizes that small States may \r\nbe particularly vulnerable to external threats and acts \r\nof interference in their internal affairs; stresses the vital \r\nimportance for all States of the unconditional respect by \r\nall States of all the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, including the principles of sovereign equality, \r\nterritorial integrity, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of other countries and the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and their consistent application; also stresses \r\nthe importance of strengthening regional security \r\narrangements by increasing interaction, cooperation \r\nand consultation; appeals to the relevant regional and \r\ninternational organizations to provide assistance when \r\nrequested by small States for the strengthening of \r\ntheir security in accordance with the principles of the \r\nCharter; requests the Secretary-General to continue \r\nto pay special attention to monitoring the security \r\nsituation of small States and to consider making use \r\nof Article 99 of the Charter; and calls on the Security \r\nCouncil and other relevant organs of the United Nations \r\nto pay special attention to the protection and security \r\nof small States. That is a manifesto for small States, \r\ncontained in a resolution adopted by the General \r\nAssembly 21 years ago.\r\nGuyana is a small State and a new State, a product \r\nof the post-Second World War promise of peace. \r\nGuyana is a child of the United Nations. Eight months \r\nfrom now, on 26 May 2016, Guyana will mark the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of its independence. But for 50 \r\nyears, our small country has been prevented from fully \r\nexploiting its rich natural resources. Venezuela has \r\nthreatened and deterred investors and frustrated our \r\neconomic development. For 50 years it has violated \r\nour territorial integrity by occupying part of our \r\nterritory, the most recent incident in that regard being \r\non 10 October 2013, when it sent a naval corvette into \r\nour maritime zone and expelled a peaceful petroleum-\r\nexploration vessel conducting seismic surveys. For \r\n50 years Venezuela has promulgated decrees making \r\nspurious claims on our territory, the most recent on \r\n26 May, our independence anniversary, when it issued \r\ndecree number 1,787, containing specific coordinates \r\nthat would annex almost our entire maritime zone, and \r\nconstituting a reassertion of Venezuela’s claim to 5 of \r\nGuyana’s 10 regions.\r\nGuyana rejects Venezuela’s threats and claims, \r\nmade in defiance of international law, and we resist its \r\nacts of aggression, conducted in defiance of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which prescribes the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and proscribes the use of armed \r\nforce.\r\nGuyana’s borders with Venezuela were settled \r\n116 years ago. The entire world, except the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, accepts and acknowledges \r\nour borders. In 1968, at the Assembly’s twenty-third \r\nsession (see A/PV.1680), Guyana explained to the world \r\nhow in 1897 a treaty of arbitration was signed between \r\nthe United Kingdom and Venezuela. That treaty \r\nprovided for the establishment of an arbitral tribunal \r\nto determine the boundary line between the colony \r\nof British Guiana, as we were then, and Venezuela. \r\nIt committed the parties to consider the result of the \r\nproceedings of the tribunal of arbitration as a full, \r\nperfect and final settlement of all the questions referred \r\nto the arbitrators. The tribunal issued its decision on \r\n3 October 1899, awarding Venezuela 13,000 square \r\nkilometres of our territory, an area bigger than Jamaica \r\nor Lebanon. Venezuela was bound under international \r\nlaw to respect that decision, which it did for the next \r\nsix decades.\r\nFrom the beginning of Guyana’s independence, \r\nhowever, Venezuela has resorted to various stratagems \r\nto deprive us of our territory. There has been a series \r\nof acts of aggression by Presidents of Venezuela \r\nagainst my country, from President Raúl Leoni \r\nOtero’s decree number 1,152 of 15 June 1968 to \r\nPresident Nicolás Maduro Moro’s of 26 May of this \r\nyear. Venezuela — more than four times the size \r\nof Guyana, with armed forces that are more than 40 \r\ntimes the size of our defence force — mindful of its \r\nsuperior wealth and military strength, but unmindful \r\nof its obligation as a Member of the United Nations, the \r\nUnion of South American Nations and the Organization \r\nof American States, has pursued a path of intimidation \r\nand aggression. It is unsettling a settled border. It is \r\ndestabilizing a stable region of the globe by the use of \r\narmed force against a small, peaceful State. Venezuela \r\nhas retarded Guyana’s development through its use of \r\nthreats that are intended to force a small State to yield \r\nup its birthright. Its expansionist ambitions cannot be \r\nallowed to undermine the principle of the inviolability \r\n4/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nof borders and the tenets of international law, and to \r\nredraw borders that have gone undisturbed for decades.\r\nGuyana recommits to preserving the Caribbean \r\nas a zone of peace. Today we renew our pledge before \r\nthe Assembly that we will pursue the path of peace for \r\nall time. We reaffirm our commitment to the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes. Guyana has total \r\nconfidence in international law, and seeks a resolution \r\nof this controversy that is consistent with the provisions \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Geneva Agreement, signed on 17 February \r\n1966, between the Governments of the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Venezuela and \r\nBritish Guiana, as we were then, provides for action to be \r\ntaken by the Secretary-General of the United Nations in \r\norder to resolve any contention occasioned by the claim \r\nmade by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela that the \r\narbitral award of 1899 is null and void. Guyana has full \r\nconfidence in the judgement and capacity of the United \r\nNations, through the Office of the Secretary-General, \r\nto identify solutions that will validate the just, perfect \r\nand final nature of its decision. We thank the United \r\nNations and the Secretary-General for appointing \r\nvarious officials during the past 25 years to use their \r\ngood offices to help to resolve this controversy. We \r\nfeel, however, that the process has now been exhausted.\r\nGuyana does not want this obnoxious territorial \r\nclaim to obscure our country’s prospects for peace and \r\nobstruct its potential growth for the next 50 years. We \r\nneed a permanent solution if we are to avoid a fate of \r\nperpetual peril and penury, and we seek a juridical \r\nsettlement to the controversy. We put our faith and our \r\nfate in the hands of the international system of peace \r\npromised by the Charter of the United Nations nearly \r\n70 years ago. We want to bring an end to Venezuelan \r\naggression. We want to develop our country, all of \r\nour country, in accordance with international law. \r\nGuyana therefore calls on the United Nations to give \r\nreal meaning to resolution 49/31 of 9 May 1994 by \r\nestablishing a collective security system designed \r\nnot merely to monitor but also, more importantly, to \r\nmaintain the security of small States. That resolution, \r\nas I said, is a manifesto for the security of small States.\r\nThe United Nations remains our best hope and \r\nprospect for peace, the best assurance of security for \r\nsmall States. It is our strength, support and succour \r\nin times of danger. We pledge Guyana’s adherence \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations. Guyana seeks \r\nnothing more than the solidarity of the international \r\ncommunity, the assurance of the Charter and the safety \r\nof international law.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Guyana \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hage Geingob, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Hage G. Geingob, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Geingob: I am honoured to be here today \r\nto deliver my maiden address to the General Assembly \r\nas the third President of the Republic of Namibia. I wish \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session. In \r\nthe same vein, let me take this opportunity to thank the \r\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nfor the sterling job he did during his tenure as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\nAs I arrived at this building, I could not help but \r\nexperience a strong sense of nostalgia. It has been said \r\nthat a journey of 1,000 miles begins with one step. In \r\n1964, 51 years ago, standing at the foot of the steps to \r\nthis building, I began my 1,000-mile journey, starting \r\noff as a young petitioner for the South West Africa \r\nPeople’s Organization (SWAPO) against the illegal \r\noccupation of South West Africa by apartheid South \r\nAfrica. On 23 April 1990, I returned to address the \r\nAssembly as the first Prime Minister of an independent \r\nNamibia during the admission of our young nation into \r\nthe fold of the United Nations family (see A/S-18/PV.1). \r\nToday, 25 years after that moment, I am once again \r\nstanding in this building, having ascended to the \r\npresidency of our Republic. It is therefore a great joy to \r\n15-29431 5/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nbe present at the seventieth anniversary celebrations of \r\nour Organization.\r\nNamibia is a child of international solidarity, \r\nmidwifed by the United Nations. As Namibians, we are \r\nboth grateful for and proud of the support we received \r\nfrom the international community, through the United \r\nNations system, during our struggle for independence. \r\nIn fact, if I can illustrate our close bond with the United \r\nNations, in 1990, upon attaining independence, we \r\nrefused to allow the instruments of power to be handed \r\nover to our first President, Comrade Sam Nujoma, by \r\nthe then President of South Africa, Mr. De Klerk. We \r\ndemanded that the said instruments be handed over by \r\nSecretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, who in so \r\ndoing symbolized the birth of our Republic.\r\nAfter the termination of South Africa’s mandate \r\nover South West Africa, the United Nations assumed \r\ndirect responsibility over Namibia. Furthermore, \r\nit established the Nationhood Programme for \r\nNamibia, which was meant to prepare the country for \r\nindependence and future responsibilities. Through \r\nthe United Nations Institute for Namibia, established \r\nby the United Nations Council for Namibia, which I \r\nwas tasked to head from 1975 to 1989, we were able \r\nto develop the building blocks that we would use to \r\nconstruct our democracy. There is an African proverb \r\nwhich says that a patient man will eat ripe fruit. With \r\nthe assistance of the United Nations, we exercised \r\npatience in preparing for self-governance. Today, I can \r\nproudly announce to the world that in Namibia, after \r\nhaving fought to free ourselves, we are now eating the \r\nripe fruit of peace and democracy.\r\nAs an expression of our profound gratitude to the \r\ninternational community for its solidarity with our \r\npeople and our undying commitment to international \r\npeace and security, we have continued to make our \r\nmodest contribution to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations since our independence. Among other things, \r\nwe have contributed contingents to peacekeeping \r\nmissions in Cambodia, Angola, Liberia, Darfur, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Timor-Leste and South Sudan, in which our \r\nmen and women participated.\r\nAs we celebrate 70 years of the existence of this \r\ngreat experiment in human interaction, namely, our \r\nUnited Nations, there is a lot of which we can be proud. \r\nAlthough the world has not been as peaceful as we \r\nwould like, we can take solace in the fact that since the \r\nSecond World War, we have avoided a conflict of such \r\nmagnitude and intensity. Most important are the inroads \r\nwe have made into improving the conditions of human \r\nbeings on this planet by lifting millions out of extreme \r\npoverty, empowering women, advancing human rights, \r\nand spearheading the process of decolonization, which \r\nhas been completed with only one exception — that of \r\nSahrawi.\r\nWe hail from a continent whose leaders are busy \r\naddressing new goals and new commitments under the \r\nbanner of the African Union. We are in the process of \r\nestablishing the new Africa, with its own narrative \r\nas told by its sons and daughters. Africa has turned a \r\nnew leaf, bidding farewell to the days of coups d’état \r\nand embracing electoral democracy. We as Africans, \r\nthrough the African Union, have ostracized those \r\nwho have come to office through unlawful ways. The \r\nrecent coup in Burkina Faso is an example of our zero-\r\ntolerance policy towards those who come to power \r\nthrough illegal ways.\r\nHaving achieved electoral democracy, it is pertinent \r\nthat we buttress it by establishing processes, systems \r\nand institutions. When we talk about processes, we \r\nare referring mainly to electoral processes, in which \r\nelectoral commissions need to be independent, impartial \r\nand able to instil confidence in the electorate. This will \r\nensure that those who lose at the polls accept the results. \r\nIn so doing, we can bring to an end a situation where \r\nthose who lose at the polls feel left out and defeated and \r\ntherefore choose to wage war.\r\nWith respect to systems, we talk about Government \r\nsystems that continue to function through the civil \r\nservice even though there may be a political deadlock \r\nwithin a particular country. If all else fails, then \r\ninstitutions, such as our own courts, play their part. \r\nThis is what we have in Namibia. It is clear, therefore, \r\nthat we have put sound governance architecture in \r\nplace. With regard to effective governance, our track \r\nrecord speaks volumes. We are rated, inter alia, sixth \r\noverall as the best-governed country on the African \r\ncontinent by the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, \r\nrated seventh in Africa as a clean country in terms of \r\ncorruption by Transparency International, and ranked \r\nas a country with the freest press in Africa by Reporters \r\nwithout Borders.\r\nSimilarly, our macroeconomic architecture is \r\nadmirable. It is underpinned by financial stability \r\nevident in our world-class banking system — a sector \r\nranked twenty-fifth in the world by the World Economic \r\n6/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nForum — and well regulated through a prudent monetary \r\npolicy for the past 25 years. Both Fitch and Standard \r\nand Poors, the globally recognized rating experts on \r\na country’s financial stability, have consistently rated \r\nNamibia with a BBB+, which means that we are indeed a \r\ncredit-worthy country. Our debt stock is between 25 per \r\ncent and 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). \r\nClearly, at the level of governance, Namibia by all local \r\nand international standards has been doing quite well \r\nas a maturing, stable, peaceful and democratic society.\r\nHowever, we should understand that electoral \r\ndemocracy without economic democracy is \r\nmeaningless, because people do not eat peace, security, \r\ngood constitutions and democracy. We still face the \r\nchallenge of rectifying socioeconomic deficits and the \r\nsubsequent entrenched poverty caused by many years \r\nof deliberately orchestrated policies of the historic \r\nneglect and economic exclusion of black people. That \r\nsituation has proven resilient against the conventional \r\nanti-poverty strategies we have employed for the \r\npast 25 years, meaning that we have to become more \r\ninnovative in our approach in that area. We are still \r\nfaced with enormous social disparities between the \r\nrich and the poor. Among other notable concerns is the \r\ncritical shortage of housing and other basic necessities. \r\nFor that reason, on the day of my inauguration as \r\nPresident of Namibia on 21 March, I announced to my \r\ncountrymen and women and to the world at large that \r\nthe Namibian Government was declaring an all-out war \r\non poverty.\r\nThe distribution of wealth is one of today’s most \r\nwidely discussed and controversial issues. However, \r\nthe distribution of wealth is too important an issue to be \r\nleft to economists at international financial institutions. \r\nIt is for that reason that Namibia continues to advise \r\ncaution against the arbitrary classification of countries \r\nbased on income alone. The current approach developed \r\nby international financial institutions, such as the \r\nWorld Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and \r\nsubsequently adopted by the United Nations, to classify \r\ncountries based solely on GDP does not reflect justice \r\nand fairness. That approach, which simply divides \r\nGDP by population, completely ignores inequalities in \r\nthe distribution of wealth and opportunities and comes \r\nwith adverse effects on social mobility and progress.\r\nNamibia has been one of the casualties of that \r\napproach, as it has been wrongly classified as a so-\r\ncalled upper-middle-income country without taking \r\ninto account that, due to Apartheid, the economic \r\nwealth of the country remained in the hands of the \r\nminority white population, leaving blacks on the fringes \r\nof the economy. Instead of the international community \r\nassisting us in fighting the second phase of the struggle, \r\nwe feel as if we have been left to fend for ourselves \r\nsince the aforementioned classification effectively \r\ndenies Namibia access to grants and concessional loans \r\nto support our development agenda.\r\nOne cannot build a nation when some citizens do not \r\nparticipate in the economy and therefore feel left out. \r\nNobel Laureate Amartya Sen rightly states that poverty \r\nshould be seen as the deprivation of basic capabilities \r\nrather than merely as low income. The deprivation of \r\nelementary capabilities can be reflected in premature \r\nmortality; significant undernourishment, especially of \r\nchildren; persistent morbidity; widespread illiteracy \r\nand other failures. We can therefore see that the effects \r\nof poverty are so interrelated that those among us \r\nwho have the misfortune of being poor are trapped in \r\nperpetual cycles of poverty and despair.\r\nFurther to the issue of poverty eradication, I would \r\nlike to add that one of the most impactful interventions \r\nwe can make in the war against poverty is by \r\nempowering women, who, although representing half \r\nof the world’s population, account for nearly 70 per cent \r\nof the world’s poor. In Namibia, gender equality is not \r\nmerely lip service. We have benefitted from SWAPO’s \r\ninternal reform of its party list system to include the \r\n50-50 per cent representation of women. Due to the \r\nSWAPO victory at the national electoral polls, female \r\nrepresentation in our Parliament has increased from \r\n24 per cent to 47 per cent, second only to Rwanda, \r\nwhich has up to 64 per cent female representation in \r\nits Parliament. I have promised that we shall catch up.\r\nI have also appointed a Namibia’s first female Prime \r\nMinister, and a female Deputy Prime Minister who also \r\nserves as our Minister for International Relations and \r\nCooperation. She is present in the Assembly today. \r\nFurthermore, I have appointed female Ministers at the \r\nhelm of our Basic and Higher Education Ministries. \r\nBoth the Minister and Deputy Minister are females. \r\nWhat matters is educating us when we are young; we \r\nthink that by placing education under their care that we \r\nwill do better.\r\nThe current, ref lective seventieth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has charted the course for the future \r\nwith the adoption, two days ago, of the new Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which urge us all to join hands \r\n15-29431 7/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nto build a new type of international relations based \r\non win-win cooperation in order to realize the lofty \r\nideals of living together in peace with one another as \r\ngood neighbours. The onus is on us to ensure that this \r\nseventieth session marks the beginning of a unified \r\ncommitment to establishing peace in all areas of the \r\nworld. Let us ensure that no country feels left out of \r\nthat process.\r\nHuman rights are not divisible; fundamental \r\nfreedoms are not divisible; democracy is not divisible; \r\nself-determination is not divisible. These freedoms \r\napply to all of us as human beings on this planet. \r\nThe peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara should \r\nbe allowed to enjoy their inalienable rights to self-\r\ndetermination and national independence, just like all \r\nother people, because those rights are not divisible; \r\nthey apply to all of us.\r\nNamibia therefore reaffirms its full and \r\nunequivocal support for the inalienable rights of the \r\npeople of Palestine and of the Western Sahara to self-\r\ndetermination and national independence. In that \r\ncontext, we call upon the United Nations to assume its \r\nfull responsibility by implementing all its resolutions \r\nand decisions on Palestine with no preconditions. \r\nWe equally call for the urgent implementation of all \r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly resolutions, \r\nwith the aim of holding a free and fair referendum in \r\nthe Western Sahara.\r\nThere have been a number of developments on \r\nthe geopolitical landscape that are encouraging in \r\nterms of a more safe and peaceful world. One of those \r\ndevelopments is the thawing of relations between the \r\nRepublic of Cuba and the United States of America. \r\nFor the past 25 years, Namibia has continued to call \r\nfor the United States and Cuba to walk the 15 miles \r\nof peaceful coexistence. In that regard, we applaud \r\nthe re-establishment of diplomatic relations between \r\nthe two countries, as well as the laudable efforts of \r\nthe two leaders to ease political tension. We commend \r\nboth countries for realizing that their differences \r\nare best addressed through engagement rather than \r\nestrangement. However, we hope that the first step will \r\nbe followed by the unconditional lifting of the embargo \r\nimposed on the people of Cuba.\r\nOver the 70 years of its existence, the United \r\nNations has evolved with the world as new issues and \r\nchallenges have emerged. It is therefore proper for the \r\nOrganization to reposition itself to deal with these \r\ndynamic changes. Accordingly, Namibia remains \r\ncommitted to comprehensive United Nations reform in \r\norder to strengthen the Organization and make it more \r\nefficient and responsive to the needs of all its Members. \r\nIn this regard, reforms of the United Nations system \r\nshould be guided by the principles of democracy, \r\nequity, justice and fairness for all.\r\nWith respect to reform of the Security Council, \r\nNamibia fully supports the African Common Position \r\nas set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus and reaffirmed \r\nby declaration at the 25th Ordinary Summit of the \r\nAfrican Union. The continent of Africa deserves to be \r\nfairly and equitably represented in the Security Council \r\nin order to rectify the long historical injustice endured \r\nby a continent with over 1 billion people.\r\nAs President of the eleventh Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Convention to Combat \r\nDesertification, Namibia is of the view that we will not \r\nend poverty unless we tackle the interlinked issues of \r\ndesertification, land degradation and drought. These \r\nissues are of critical importance, not only to Namibia \r\nand Africa, but for the entire world.\r\nAs we prepare to celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the creation of the Organization, an \r\norganization with which so many of us here share \r\na history and fond memories during our struggle for \r\nfreedom and dignity, we must ensure that we leave a \r\nlegacy behind for future generations — a legacy of \r\npeace, unity and the commitment to equitable and \r\nsustainable development. I would like to reflect on the \r\nwords of the former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \r\nwho once said,\r\n“More than ever before in human history, we share \r\na common destiny. We can master it only if we face \r\nit together (SG/SM/7262).\r\nAnd that, my friends, is why we have the United \r\nNations. The only way we can overcome our challenges \r\nis to form a united front for the advancement of \r\nhumankind. Through the United Nations we have the \r\nplatform to achieve this goal. We can either choose to \r\nmarch to the tune set by the original ideals that led to \r\nthe formation of the United Nations or we can choose \r\nto pursue our ambitions at the expense of others and \r\nourselves. Let us choose nobility, where we overcome \r\nour fears, insecurities and prejudices for the sake of \r\nshared sustainable development. Let us leave a long-\r\nlasting legacy that will shape the future of our planet \r\npolitically, economically and ecologically.\r\n8/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nThe time to act is now, and Namibia stands ready \r\nto join hands with all members of the international \r\ncommunity to celebrate a new type of global coexistence, \r\nwhere no continent, no region and no country will feel \r\nleft out.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Namibia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the \r\nRepublic of Tajikistan, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssemb\r\nPresident Rahmon (spoke in Tajik; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is a great pleasure \r\nto join other delegations in expressing our cordial \r\ncongratulations to you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly offers \r\na unique opportunity not only to acknowledge the \r\naccomplishments of the United Nations over the last \r\n70 years, but also to reiterate our strong commitment \r\nto meeting the aspirations and hopes of our peoples \r\nfor secure and sustainable development. For 70 years, \r\nthe United Nations has stood for peace and security, \r\ninternational cooperation and human rights. Over \r\nthis short but intense period of history, the United \r\nNations has made great strides in promoting stability \r\nand sustainable development and in reducing or even \r\neliminating poverty and inequality all over the world. \r\nDuring this period, the mechanisms for interaction \r\nthat we have set up together to facilitate international \r\ncooperation have functioned with considerable success. \r\nRecently, the United Nations Summit adopted the new \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), which lays the foundation for and identifies the \r\nareas in which the international community can work \r\nto attain sustainable development that would meet the \r\ninterests of all peoples and every individual.\r\nOver seven decades, the United Nations has \r\nmade a remarkable contribution to assisting in the \r\nformation of new independent States and their further \r\ndevelopment. When, at the dawn of its independence, \r\nTajikistan was faced with the difficulties of transition, \r\nit received extensive support from the United Nations, \r\nwhich enabled the country to embark on the road \r\ntowards democratic development. The major pillars of \r\nTajikistan’s development, laid down with the assistance \r\nof the United Nations, contributed to the country’s \r\nability to participate in international processes set up \r\nto foster cooperation and interaction. Today, Tajikistan \r\nis contributing significantly to fighting terrorism and \r\nextremism, transnational organized crime, illicit drug \r\ntrafficking, arms smuggling and human trafficking, \r\nand in promotion of the United Nations water agenda.\r\nOur national police officers are participating \r\nin United Nations and African Union peacekeeping \r\noperations in Darfur and are contributing to \r\npeacebuilding processes shoulder to shoulder with \r\ncolleagues from other Member States. Our drug \r\ncontrol agency that was established with United \r\nNations support continues to play an important role in \r\ncombating illicit drug trafficking. Indeed, since 1995, \r\nTajikistan’s national drug enforcement authorities have \r\nconfiscated more than 111 metric tons of narcotics, an \r\namount equivalent to 206,650,000 drug doses, which \r\ncould turn 50 million people the world over into drug \r\nabusers. This data proves that Tajikistan ranks among \r\nthe world’s top 10 States in the seizure of illicit drugs.\r\nThe world has undergone dramatic transformation \r\nin the last decades. Global processes are more dynamic \r\nand complex than ever. Along with the positive \r\ncontributions globalization has made to overall \r\ndevelopment, globalization has also had negative \r\nimpacts that threaten security and development in \r\nindividual countries and in the world as a whole.\r\nThe increase in the number of armed conflicts and \r\nacts of terror, food, energy and financial and economic \r\ncrises, degradation of the environment, climate change \r\nand the spread of infectious diseases demand from us a \r\nconcerted and comprehensive response. In this context, \r\nthe United Nations remains the key platform for \r\nconsensus on the key issues of international security \r\nand development and for coordination of joint action \r\n15-29431 9/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nof the international community towards responding to \r\nglobal threats and challenges. Of special concern are \r\nthe scope and global nature of the current threats posed \r\nby terrorism, drug-trafficking and organized crime. \r\nThe destructive and inhumane forces of terrorism \r\nand extremism have continued to gain in strength, \r\nattracting into their orbit an ever-growing number of \r\nyoung people. Those forces seriously undermine efforts \r\nof countries and regions to maintain the security and \r\npeaceful development.\r\nCombating international terrorism and extremism \r\nhas become a top priority. There is an undeniable \r\nneed to develop national, regional and international \r\nmechanisms to eliminate military infrastructure, block \r\nchannels of financial and logistical support, prevent \r\nrecruiting and propaganda that promotes violence, \r\nand counteract the use of modern information and \r\ncommunication technologies for the purpose of terror. \r\nIt is also essential that we pool our efforts to find ways \r\nto address the issues of poverty reduction and the \r\nnegative impact of globalization, and to prevent and \r\nresolve regional conflicts. Strengthening cross-cultural \r\nand interfaith dialogue, mutual trust and tolerance \r\nwould play a pivotal role.\r\nIt is in our common interests for Member States \r\nto implement the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council in order \r\nto effectively combat all forms and manifestations of \r\nterrorism, including the use of the Internet for terrorist \r\nactivities. Any joint response to a sudden outbreak of \r\nterrorism and extremism should be commensurate with \r\nthe scope of that threat.\r\nThe prevention of drug-trafficking, which has \r\nunfortunately continued to increase yearly, should \r\nbecome an integral part of our common struggle against \r\nterrorism and global organized crime. Money earned \r\nfrom drug-trafficking is channelled to financing acts \r\nof terror and organized crime activities. In that context, \r\nthe special session on drugs to be held in 2016 will offer \r\nan opportunity not only to review the implementation \r\nof the Political Declaration and Plan of Action on \r\nInternational Cooperation towards an Integrated and \r\nBalanced Strategy to Counter the World Drug Problem, \r\nbut also to develop new and effective measures for \r\ncombating that evil. In the light of those efforts, in May \r\nTajikistan held a high-level international conference on \r\ndrug control that sought to consolidate international \r\ncooperation on counter-narcotics.\r\nOur friendly neighbouring nation of Afghanistan \r\nhas embarked on the implementation of its \r\ntransformation decade. The new stage of enhancing and \r\nreinforcing the security and stability of the country and \r\nthe rehabilitation of its economic and social sectors is \r\nbeing accompanied by addressing the most urgent and \r\npractical issues, which requires increasing the targeted \r\nassistance of the international community, in which the \r\nUnited Nations should play a central and coordinating \r\nrole. Tajikistan is in favour of expanding friendly and \r\ngood-neighbourly relations with Afghanistan and calls \r\non the international community to support the efforts \r\nof the Government of that country to achieve peace \r\nand stability by addressing the social and economic \r\nchallenges that the country faces, pursuing the process \r\nof national reconciliation and inclusive dialogue, \r\nand involving the country in regional cooperation. \r\nTajikistan continues to make its contribution to the \r\nsocial and economic development of Afghanistan.\r\nThe peaceful solution of the issue of the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme demonstrated the enormous \r\npotential of diplomatic means to resolve the urgent \r\nproblems of our shared planet. We are convinced that the \r\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme, enshrined in Security Council resolution \r\n2231 (2015), will contribute to the strengthening of \r\nregional and international peace, genuine stability and \r\nmutual trust and be instrumental in reinforcing the \r\nnuclear non-proliferation regime. We hope that United \r\nNations Member States will be guided by good will \r\nand resolve to resolve the most urgent disputes and \r\nconflicts, by using political and diplomatic means, in \r\naddressing other urgent issues.\r\nLast July, Tajikistan hosted regional consultations \r\nfor the countries of South and Central Asia in \r\npreparation of the World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 \r\nin Istanbul. We hope that the recommendations voiced \r\nat those consultations will have a positive effect on the \r\nhumanitarian activities of all countries.\r\nIn December, the international community will \r\nmeet again at the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Paris to conclude the round of negotiations \r\non climate change that we began in Bali. We hope that \r\nMember States will take advantage of that opportunity \r\nand adopt a new document on climate change, based on \r\nthe principles of the Framework Convention and, by so \r\ndoing, lay the foundations of a transition to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We believe that such a transition will \r\n10/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nrequire not only industrial modernization, based on \r\ninnovative technologies, but also significant changes in \r\nmentalities and consumption patterns.\r\nThe long-term observations of our experts attest \r\nto the increased impact of climate change on the \r\nenvironmental, social and economic situation in our \r\ncountry and region. According to those observations, \r\nover the past 60 years the average annual temperature in \r\nTajikistan has increased by 1°C, the number of days with \r\nheavy precipitation has risen, natural meteorological \r\ndisasters have become more frequent and severe, and \r\nthe degradation of glaciers has accelerated. This past \r\nsummer, as a result of the abnormally high temperature \r\nand severe precipitation, the mountainous part of the \r\ncountry suffered natural disasters that caused hundreds \r\nof millions of United States dollars in economic damage. \r\nRegrettably, these disasters also claimed human lives.\r\nIn terms of carbon dioxide emissions, Tajikistan \r\nranks one hundred and thirty-fifth among greenhouse \r\ngas-emitting countries. Per capita greenhouse gas \r\nemissions in the country is 10 times less than that of \r\nthe average world index. Widespread use of renewable \r\nenergy sources — predominantly hydropower — would \r\nfacilitate the economic and social development of the \r\ncountry and promote the “green economy”.\r\nIt is becoming apparent that climate change affects \r\nthe quantity and quality of freshwater resources. It is \r\nknown that as a result of climate change, the amount \r\nof water resources stored in glaciers and snow caps \r\nhas diminished, the area of ground waters affected \r\nby salinization has increased, and precipitation has \r\nbecome more frequent and heavier. In turn, the changes \r\nin the hydrological cycle may have a negative impact \r\non water, energy and food security and entail an added \r\nrisk of f loods and extreme droughts. We believe that in \r\nsuch circumstances, it is essential to review existing \r\npractices of water-resource management in order to \r\nensure adequate adaptation not only to climate change, \r\nbut also to population growth and a changing world \r\neconomy, as well as to the scarcity of freshwater \r\nresources.\r\nIn Central Asia, where water resources are a key \r\nfactor in achieving the sustainable development of the \r\nregion, the need for the elaboration of a comprehensive \r\nregional plan of adaptation to climate change became \r\nurgent long ago. This imperative is also driven by the \r\naccelerated degradation of the glaciers in the region as \r\na result of climate change. The observations of expert \r\nconfirm that, since the 1960s, the region’s glaciers, \r\nwhich remain the main source of water for Central \r\nAsian rivers, have been degraded by a factor of three.\r\nAs 2015 is the final year of the International \r\nDecade for Action, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, a \r\nglobal initiative approved by the General Assembly \r\nto facilitate the achievement of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, a number of water forums have \r\nbeen held to review progress and analyse gaps in the \r\nimplementation of the International Decade. Such \r\nforums include the General Assembly high-level \r\ninteractive dialogue for a comprehensive review of the \r\nprogress on the implementation of the International \r\nDecade, held last March here in New York, and a high-\r\nlevel international conference on the implementation of \r\nthe International Decade held in Dushanbe, in June. We \r\nexpect that, in taking stock of the results of the Decade, \r\nthe United Nations will take on board the outcomes of \r\nthese events and other relevant forums held in support \r\nof a comprehensive review of the implementation of the \r\nDecade.\r\nI take this opportunity to extend my deep \r\nappreciation to the Member States, the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Secretary-General, the \r\nUnited Nations agencies and institutions, international \r\norganizations, and representatives of civil society, \r\nacademia and business for actively participating in \r\nand implementing the Decade and for following up its \r\noutcomes.\r\nA few days ago, we adopted a road map for \r\nachieving sustainable development that comprehensively \r\nincorporates the water component. Over the next \r\n15 years, against the backdrop of the ever-increasing \r\nimpact of climate change on water resources, \r\nenvironmental degradation, population growth and \r\nfood and energy crises, we will have to make enormous \r\nefforts to ensure the timely achievement of the goals we \r\nhave set forth.\r\nIn our view, fostering cooperation, partnership and \r\nwater diplomacy will promote the timely adoption of \r\nrelevant measures to mitigate the impact of destructive \r\nprocesses and help to achieve Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. In this context, there is a need for additional \r\nplatforms for strengthening cooperation at all levels \r\nwith the engagement of all interested stakeholders. In \r\nthis regard, and given the positive outcomes of previous \r\njoint initiatives, we propose to consider the possibility \r\nof proclaiming a new international water decade, aimed \r\n15-29431 11/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nat promoting the implementation of the new 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. We sincerely \r\nhope that all States Members of the United Nations will \r\nlend their support to make this initiative a reality.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nTajikistan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Emomali Rahmon, President of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Finland.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Niinistö: Let me begin by congratulating \r\nyou, Sir, on your election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. You have the full \r\nsupport of Finland in your important task.\r\nWe are celebrating the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations. The Charter of the United Nations \r\nwas written in a world that lay in ruins after the Second \r\nWorld War. Today, we must face our challenges with \r\nthe same determination our predecessors had in 1945. \r\nBy adopting the ambitious new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) we are taking \r\nequally, or even more important steps, for humankind.\r\nThis year also marks the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nFinland’s membership of the Organization. Finland \r\njoined a family of countries that care and shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities. We felt this concern when Finnish \r\nnational composer Jean Sibelius passed away in 1957. \r\nThe General Assembly decided to honour him with a \r\nmoment of silence. The President of the Assembly at \r\nthat session, Mr. Leslie Munro, described how Sibelius \r\nbelonged to the whole world. We also understood what \r\nshouldering responsibility means by participating in the \r\nfirst United Nations peacekeeping operation in Suez.\r\nWe are now facing an extremely dangerous crisis \r\nin Syria, Iraq and parts of North Africa. We are also \r\nwitnessing an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe \r\nunlike any other since the Second World War. The \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and its \r\nhorrendous terror are a direct by-product of the conflicts \r\nin Syria and Iraq. It threatens the peace and stability of \r\nthe Middle East, Africa and even Europe. We are facing \r\na new era of migration, largely due to wars and conflict. \r\nAround 60 million refugees, the largest number since \r\nthe Second World War, clearly attest to this.\r\nThe current refugee situation in the Middle East, \r\nin many parts of Africa and in the Mediterranean is \r\nunbearable for everyone. Although neighbouring \r\ncountries bear the heaviest burden, the refugee crisis is \r\ncausing serious political tension in Europe. Finland is \r\nalso receiving a very high number of asylum-seekers. \r\nNot providing assistance is not an option for us, but \r\nwe have to find more effective and sustainable ways \r\nto help those in need. Resolving the conflict in Syria \r\nand elsewhere is essential to any lasting solution. The \r\ninternational community must show that it cares. The \r\nSecurity Council and the countries in the region in \r\nparticular must work together to find a political solution \r\nto the crisis in Syria. Finland welcomes all constructive \r\nefforts that pave the way for realistic, workable and \r\nlasting peace within a framework of international \r\ncooperation. Finland also remains committed to the \r\nwork of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL.\r\nThe conflict in Ukraine has not been resolved, \r\nalthough an agreement to this end has been approved. \r\nWe welcome the steps taken towards the implementation \r\nof the Minsk agreement. All illegal measures, such as \r\nthe annexation of Crimea to Russia, cannot and must \r\nnot be accepted.\r\nThese conflicts are not the only ones. Last year \r\nalone, there were 42 armed conflicts that resulted \r\nin approximately 180,000 fatalities. Wars and their \r\nconsequences continue to threaten stability far beyond \r\nthe war zone itself. United Nations peace operations are \r\nat the very heart of its efforts to maintain international \r\npeace and security, yet the scope and complexity of \r\ntoday’s violent conflicts have surpassed the ability of \r\nthe international community to address them properly. \r\nCritical thinking, f lexibility and decisive action are \r\nneeded to manage and resolve those crises. The initiative \r\nto carry out major reviews of the United Nations peace \r\nand security architecture was therefore most timely.\r\n12/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nI very much welcome the excellent report produced \r\nby President Ramos-Horta’s High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations (A/70/357). It rightly \r\nstresses the primacy of politics; political solutions \r\nmust always guide the deployment of United Nations \r\npeace operations. The United Nations prevention \r\nand mediation capacities must be strengthened \r\nand sufficiently funded. Finland is proud to have \r\ncontributed to that shift of paradigm, especially by \r\nco-chairing the Group of Friends of Mediation, together \r\nwith Turkey. The Group of Friends will continue its \r\nefforts to advance the recommendations of the Panel. \r\nSince the beginning of its membership, Finland has \r\ncontributed 50,000 men and women to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. In per capita terms, we are \r\nthe second-largest contributor in Europe, and we will \r\nfurther increase our contribution. We will shoulder our \r\nresponsibility.\r\nLet me add that this year also marks a major \r\nsuccess of international diplomacy — the historic \r\nagreement reach on the Iran nuclear programme. We \r\nlook forward to the swift implementation by Iran of \r\nall the nuclear measures and its full engagement with \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve all \r\noutstanding issues.\r\nHumankind faces the need for profound change. \r\nWe cannot continue business as usual, which is a way \r\nof life transcends our planet’s boundaries and exhausts \r\nthe Earth’s resources. We have all the facts at our \r\ndisposal. For example, on global warming, it is up to us \r\nto act. We can choose or lose our future. I believe that \r\nwe are on the right track. We have just adopted the new \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), which has the potential to transform the world. \r\nFor the very first time, we have a real programme for \r\nsustainable development binding all Member States. \r\nNow it is up to us to implement that ambitious agenda.\r\nI urge the United Nations to once again demonstrate \r\nits convening power. We must get everybody on board \r\nto make the commitments a reality. The private sector \r\nand civil society are in a key position to take the \r\nAgenda forward, together with Governments. Even \r\nindividual persons have a role to play. Another vital \r\nstep in tackling global challenges is yet to take place; I \r\nrefer to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Paris in December. Let us make \r\nit a success. We must care for our children and their \r\nchildren.\r\nThe post of the Secretary-General has been \r\ncalled the most impossible job in the world. Actually, \r\nit is not only a job — it is an institution of which the \r\nwhole United Nations membership should feel a sense \r\nof ownership. Strong political leadership is required, \r\nespecially in cases where the international community \r\nis unable to find common views. I very much welcome \r\nefforts to enhance the transparency and inclusiveness \r\nof the selection process of the next Secretary-General. \r\nAs a nation that has championed gender equality \r\nthroughout its 60-year United Nations membership, my \r\ncountry, Finland, expects to see many excellent female \r\ncandidates for the position. It is high time that the other \r\nhalf of humankind took up that challenge.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Finland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic of \r\nFinland, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President \r\nof Mongolia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of \r\nMongolia, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Tsakhia: I extend my heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President. You can count on \r\nmy delegation’s full support during the jubilee session \r\nand the year ahead.\r\nWe are commemorating the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations. As a family of nations, our hopes \r\nfor peace and progress, as expressed in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, still resonates deeply today. The \r\nUnited Nations is designed to uphold humankind’s \r\nprimary aspirations to live in peace, enjoy equal \r\nrights and achieve everlasting happiness. The United \r\nNations has tirelessly served those noble purposes for \r\nseven decades. If the United Nations did not exist, \r\nmost of humankind would have ended up in violent \r\nconfrontations and faced more arduous, complex \r\nchallenges than those that have arisen.\r\n15-29431 13/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nTogether, we have achieved a lot and we have \r\ncharted a better course. The number of sovereign \r\nnations has quadrupled since 1945. The world’s \r\neconomic output has increased fivefold. Human beings \r\nenjoy longer, healthier lives. We are more literate and \r\neducated. Today, the world has achieved the highest \r\ndegree of international cooperation in history. Starting \r\nwith the founding of the United Nations, Governments \r\nhave steadily invested more and more in new means \r\nof cooperation. Those tools create new options, more \r\nspace for compromises and more legal frameworks than \r\nhumankind has ever possessed. The United Nations \r\nhas justly become the primary universal organization \r\nworking for peace, instead of war; prosperity, instead \r\nof poverty; and a dignified life for all, instead of human \r\nrights violations. Hence, I would like to state that the \r\npast 70 years were the best 70 years ever for humankind.\r\nThe founding of the United Nations, a historic \r\nmilestone, connects our past, present and future. All \r\nof humankind is poised to make another great stride \r\ntowards a new, better reality. I am hopeful for the future \r\nbecause we have the United Nations, because we have \r\nuseful experience to tackle today’s challenges, and \r\nbecause a new generation of humankind is rising. The \r\nnew generation has creative solutions to challenges and \r\nsees new opportunities in them. It shares knowledge \r\nand advance technologies.\r\nAt this moment more than ever in history, we \r\nshare a common destiny as a family of nations; yet, \r\ndespite our achievements, billions of people still live \r\nin forbidding conditions. Our home, Mother Earth, is \r\nbecoming more turbulent and is in fragile health. The \r\nSecond World War is behind us and the arms race of \r\nthe Cold War ended two decades ago. Many military \r\nconflicts today are not tied to defending a particular \r\nterritory, but are motivated by borderless ideological, \r\ncriminal and religious goals.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nParadoxically, although we are more aware of those \r\nchallenges and understand them better than ever, we \r\nseem unable to tackle them decisively and effectively. \r\nThat is why we have gathered here and embarked \r\non a momentous new journey to do much better to \r\ntransform our world. The only way to bring peace and \r\nstability is through a system of rules and norms, laws \r\nand institutions that every country agrees to abide by \r\nin exchange for the benefits of peace and stability. If \r\nthe United Nations fails to adopt a system of laws, we \r\nall will fail. The future is not only about the United \r\nNations. The future is about all of us. It is about our \r\ncommunity; it is about our family. Therefore, we have \r\nno right to fail.\r\nWe have recently shown that we can make \r\npositive changes. At the dawn of the new century, we \r\nadopted and have since implemented the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We achieved many targets, yet \r\nfailed to achieve some others. Still, by and large, \r\nthe global community passed the test. We learned \r\nlessons about working together and made huge strides \r\ntowards achieving positive goals. With the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), the international community produced a new \r\nhistory-making document. The entire United Nations \r\nfamily agreed on that road map towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Now humankind has a truly universal, \r\nambitious action plan for the upcoming 15 years. A \r\nconsensus-based, global platform, the Agenda is for all, \r\nbecause every single human being holds a stake in our \r\nplanet’s future. The 17 Goals and 169 targets are real. \r\nYet, they also embody the dream of humankind. Never \r\nbefore in history have nations reached such a universal \r\nand unanimous agreement.\r\nOur historic 2030 Agenda is comprehensive and \r\nsustainable. We have agreed on urgent targets on a \r\nbroad range of economic and social challenges and on \r\nenvironmental emergencies. Is that not miraculous? \r\nWith one voice, the entire world shouldered a mountain \r\nof responsibilities and adopted these bold Goals. In \r\nthe Agenda, I recognize the overarching objectives \r\nfor global sustainable development. I note that the \r\nGoals are intended literally to save Mother Earth for \r\nfuture generations, which I can readily accept to save a \r\nhappy, equal human race. I believe that we must build \r\ninclusive, capable institutions and create prosperous, \r\npeaceful, open, just, equitable societies. In order to \r\nadvance those societies, the family of nations needs a \r\nrobust, inclusive and open mechanisms. We must have \r\nreliable implementing, monitoring and accountability \r\nregulations and institutions in place. I appeal to every \r\nMember State to adopt national laws and policies to \r\nimplement the Sustainable Development Goals. Such \r\nlaws and policies would ensure their sustainability.\r\nI am deeply proud of my country’s contributions \r\nto the common causes of humankind. During the \r\npast quarter century, Mongolia has relentlessly \r\nstriven to build an open and just society with a free \r\n14/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nmarket economy, participatory democracy and \r\nenvironmentally conscientious policies. We have \r\nmade notable progress in the areas of governance \r\ntransparency, citizens’ participation and the reduction \r\nof corruption and poverty. In the past quarter century, \r\nthe life expectancy of Mongolians has increased by \r\nseven years. Our gross domestic product (GDP) has \r\nincreased by a factor of more than 20. We believe in \r\nhuman rights and human creativity, and we foster \r\nprivate initiatives. Our private sector generates more \r\nthan 80 per cent of our GDP growth. My country, \r\nwithin a single generation, peacefully transformed \r\nfrom one of the most isolated and closed regimes in the \r\nworld to one of its most vibrant and open democracies. \r\nMongolia also created one of the most unique, open, \r\ncompetitive and fair election systems in our region. It \r\nhas nationwide electronic voting and biometric voter \r\nregistration. We no longer use wooden or paper boxes \r\nor finger inks, and public participation goes beyond \r\nelectronic voting.\r\nCorruption is still a big threat. Yet, over the past five \r\nyears, with transparent, determined and enforceable \r\npolicies, our country’s corruption index has dropped \r\nby one-third, according to Transparency International. \r\nWe will continue to block the menace of corruption \r\nhead-on. Mongolia is among the top countries in the \r\nworld in the number of media tools used per capita. \r\nWe have the most open, censorship-free private media, \r\nincluding social media and burgeoning Internet use. We \r\nhave slightly more than 3 million citizens, yet it feels \r\nlike there are 3 million journalists, too. New media \r\ntechnologies, transparency and public scrutiny make \r\nour society much healthier.\r\nWe have adopted and implemented a set of laws \r\nrelated to an open, fair, service-oriented judiciary. \r\nBecause the process takes place under strict civil \r\nmonitoring, people’s confidence in a fair court of law \r\nis being restored. We have also created regulations and \r\ninstitutions regarding public hearings and participatory \r\ndemocracy. We are also prudently enforcing a law \r\ncalled the Glass Account — a budget transparency law \r\nthat requires full disclosure of public expenditures.\r\nEducation is key to human development and \r\nthe county’s development. More than one-third of \r\nour population is engaged in educational activities. \r\nMore student-centred than previously, our education \r\nsystem emphasizes their practical involvement in \r\nlearning. Our Government also now covers tuition if \r\na Mongolian citizen is accepted into one of the world’s \r\ntop universities.\r\nWe believe in gender equality and women’s \r\nempowerment. Mongolia is a strong supporter of \r\nthe United Nations in that cause. If societies are to \r\nadvance, we need more women in public service at all \r\nlevels, local and global. If women hold more positions \r\nof power, we will have less suffering and conflict and \r\nmore harmony and civic engagement. All such efforts \r\non the part of Mongolian citizens constitute a just, \r\ntransparent, inclusive, accountable and action-oriented \r\nplatform to guide us on a sustainable development path. \r\nI am confident that building on those bedrock successes \r\nand decisively moving forward is compatible with your \r\nappeal, Mr. President, for a new commitment to action.\r\nToday, the world faces a shocking range of new \r\nchallenges on a global scale — from weapons of mass \r\ndestruction to global warming; from human rights \r\nviolations to humanitarian disasters; from heinous \r\ncrimes and mass terror to the breakdown of sovereign \r\nStates; from an uncertain supply of energy, food and \r\nwater to new challenges to freedom and security. In \r\nfacing global challenges, we must admit one thing — no \r\none country, big or small, can address them on its own. \r\nTherefore, the coordinated actions of all players and \r\ncountries are needed.\r\nWhen all cultures and civilizations unite, we can \r\ntackle global challenges. The upcoming twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held in Paris later this year, will be the first new \r\ntest. It will require the widest possible cooperation ofall \r\ncountries. We all must bear responsibility for protecting \r\nplanet Earth and its ecosystems for the benefit of \r\npresent and future generations. We must all work to \r\nensure justice and fairness throughout the world. Every \r\nnation and Government must actively contribute to the \r\nglobal good according to their respective capabilities \r\nand responsibilities. \r\nMongolia has committed to always doing its humble \r\nshare to promote global well-being. We Mongols are \r\neager to contribute. Our peacekeepers proudly serve, \r\nalong with fellow United Nations peacekeepers, to \r\nmaintain international order and security. Mongolia has \r\nbecome one of the 20 largest peacekeeping contributors \r\nin the world. To date, 14,000 Mongolian peacekeepers \r\nhave served on active duty in global hot spots. That is \r\n15-29431 15/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\na significant number in proportion to the size of our \r\npopulation. \r\nWe are enthusiastic to share our experiences in \r\ntransitioning to democracy in our quest for freedom, \r\njustice and development. When Mongolian citizens \r\nshare and actively collaborate with countries in our \r\nregion and beyond, we make our own success more \r\ndurable. We care deeply about global stability. Mongols \r\nbelieve that we must preserve our planet by eliminating \r\nnuclear weapons throughout the world.\r\nFor 23 years, our country has maintained a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free status. Any nation seeking nuclear \r\npower must not endanger the peace and security of \r\ntheir independent neighbours. We believe that the \r\nsolution to those challenges is engagement, rather than \r\nisolation. We believe that strengthening multilateral \r\ncollaboration and mutual trust among countries is \r\nvital. In Asia, Mongolia is a non-aligned nation and \r\nan honest broker that promotes peace and security. \r\nWe launched a regional initiative similar to that of the \r\nHelsinki dialogue, known as the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue \r\non North-East Asian Security. Within that security \r\ninitiative, Mongolia has hosted and has helped arrange \r\nmultilateral meetings, conferences, and symposiums \r\nto examine peace and security issues. We also put \r\nforward a common platform called the Asian Forum for \r\nHuman Rights and Development, or FORUM-Asia. A \r\ncompelling need exists to establish a solid and inclusive \r\nplatform for comprehensive dialogues involving all \r\nAsian States. \r\nFORUM-Asia would seek to promote an equal \r\nrepresentation of the interests of all sovereign nations \r\nin Asia, whether big or small. All nations would bear \r\nin mind the concerns of all other nations, rather than \r\nwrestle one-on-one within the global arena. It would \r\nensure each member State its independence, integrity, \r\nand right to development. We invite all interested \r\nparties to play an active part of that cause. \r\nOur country also successfully chaired the world’s \r\nmost reputable democracy movement, the Community \r\nof Democracies, for two years. Currently, Mongolia is \r\nchairing the Freedom Online Coalition. The first Asian \r\ncountry to lead that important community, we promote \r\nuniversal Internet access. We support a comprehensive \r\nconvention on Internet freedom, to be agreed to by all \r\nUnited Nations Member States. I appeal to everyone to \r\nwork collectively to advance the great, global digital \r\nrevolution, in order to bring greater prosperity to \r\nhumankind. \r\nMongolia has pursued a peaceful, open and \r\nmulti-pillared foreign policy. That stance has enabled \r\nus to declare Mongolia to be a State of permanent \r\nneutrality. Our national laws and the international \r\ntreaties to which Mongolia is signatory are consistent \r\nwith the principles of neutrality. I therefore kindly ask \r\nfor Members’ understanding and support for Mongolia’s \r\npeaceful, open, neutral and active foreign policy efforts. \r\nI am convinced that Mongolia’s status of permanent \r\nneutrality will contribute to the strengthening of peace, \r\nsecurity and development in our region and the world, \r\nin general. \r\nRecently, Mongolia hosted the Asia Pacific Forum \r\nof National Human Rights Institutions, and for the \r\nfirst time in our country, the autumn meeting of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nParliamentary Assembly was convened. The human \r\nrights experts and the European parliamentarians \r\nhad fruitful, lively discussions and exchanges. The \r\nconference also provided a splendid opportunity for \r\nthem to comprehend at first hand our achievements in \r\nprotecting and advancing human rights, in exercising \r\nthe rule of law and in running a pluralistic and open \r\nsociety. \r\nWe are honoured to be hosting many events \r\nin the coming months and year in our capital city. \r\nMost importantly, the eleventh Asia-Europe Meeting \r\n(ASEM) will be held in Mongolia in the summer of \r\n2016. Leaders of 53 countries in Asia and Europe will \r\nmeet in Mongolia on the historic twentieth jubilee of \r\nthe founding of ASEM. I earnestly look forward to \r\nwelcoming them. Mongolia will further consolidate \r\nand strengthen our peace initiatives and our role as \r\nmediator. Our doors are always open for dialogue \r\nand engagement. We will always say that all are very \r\nwelcome to cooperate with us in the spirit of freedom, \r\njustice and prosperity. We are ready to share the lessons \r\nwe have learned and to listen to and learn from the \r\nlessons of other nations. \r\nI wish to stress that Mongolia is running for the \r\nfirst time for membership on the United Nations \r\nHuman Rights Council. We believe that the Human \r\nRights Council is a crucial body for the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights worldwide. It is a \r\nplatform for open discussions on human rights issues, \r\nand it positively impacts national and international \r\n16/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\npolicies. Mongolia reaffirms its full commitment to the \r\npromotion of human rights and our willingness to share \r\nour experience in transitioning to democracy, fighting \r\nagainst corruption, abolishing the death penalty and \r\nensuring genuine human rights. I respectfully ask \r\nevery Member State to extend its valuable support to \r\nMongolia’s candidacy for the Human Rights Council at \r\nthe October elections. \r\nWe, the States Members of the United Nations, \r\nneed to mobilize the full potential of humankind \r\nto achieve the primary purpose for establishing the \r\nUnited Nations, namely, the promotion of peace, the \r\nrespect for human rights and inclusive economic and \r\nsocial development. I believe that, in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, the United Nations will remain at the heart \r\nof our common humanity. Its mission will be defined \r\nby a new, more profound awareness of the sanctity and \r\ndignity of every human life, regardless of race, gender \r\nor religion. Nevertheless, there are still numerous cases \r\ninvolving cruel violations of human dignity and rights. \r\nOne thing is certain: every nation State should always \r\nstrive for good governance, the strict rule of law and a \r\nsound human rights policy. \r\nI reiterate the appeals of all speakers in the \r\nAssembly that we must vow to exercise clear and \r\ndecisive leadership in effectively tackling the tough \r\nchallenges ahead and in fulfilling the core missions \r\nof the United Nations. We have many opportunities to \r\nbenefit the world. We are the first in history to have \r\nthe potential, technology and resources to resolve the \r\nworld’s problems. \r\nWhen I observe a giant display of military might, I \r\nthink of the huge amount of money, human ingenuity and \r\ntime that are being spent on war machines and weapons \r\nof mass destruction. With a fraction of the money that \r\nwe spend and the technology that we develop to put on \r\nsuch macho war shows, we could solve many of today’s \r\ntroubling issues. We also have a smart, tech-savvy, \r\nenergetic young generation, who will soon shoulder our \r\ntough challenges with their innovative, dynamic and \r\nshrewd solutions. They give us hope and reassure us. \r\nI would like to reiterate that the solemn purpose of \r\nthe United Nations has always been to enhance global \r\npeace, protect fellow human beings and contribute to \r\nglobal well-being. We all know there are well-founded \r\ncriticisms of the United Nations. If our United Nations \r\nis to survive in the new reality, we must embrace \r\nsubstantive change. We need reforms to build a just and \r\ncommon home. If we delay action, change will become \r\nmore painful and even more challenging. The United \r\nNations is still our most representative and important \r\nglobal body. Its foundation is based on the preservation \r\nof the rights and interests of all nations, whether big or \r\nsmall, so that they may have a voice, a vote, and be part \r\nof our common human home. More relevant than ever, \r\nthe United Nations is our common home where nations \r\ncan meet and create solutions to solve the challenges of \r\nthe world. If the 70 years since the United Nations was \r\nfounded were the best 70 years ever, as I believe, then \r\nlet us make the next 70 years even better.\r\nWe humans are at our best when we face challenges \r\nand when we exercise collective bravery, spirit and \r\nleadership. With the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwe all become developing countries and we all have \r\na stake in our plans for success. There is no future \r\nwithout peace, there is no planet without sustainability, \r\nand there is no humanity without justice. Let us strive \r\nfor victory. Let us all be champions, Let us raise all our \r\nf lags at the finish line, and let us all proudly present \r\nthem to our beautiful planet’s next generation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Mongolia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President \r\nof Romania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nRomania.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, \r\nPresident of Romania, and to invite him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nPresident Iohannis: My delegation would like \r\nto congratulate the President on his assuming the \r\npresidency of this important session. We have found \r\ninspiration in the theme of the session: “The United \r\nNations at 70 — a new commitment to action”. Allow \r\nme also to express my appreciation to Denmark, \r\nan example of true dedication to the work of the \r\n15-29431 17/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nOrganization and one of the very few Members that \r\nhave met the commitment to allocate 0.7 per cent of \r\nits gross domestic product for official development \r\nassistance.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nis yet another opportunity for a lucid reflection on the \r\nlessons learned and the future of our Organization. \r\nWhat we have seen is a visionary project born from \r\nthe ashes of a terrible tragedy, with the lofty goal of \r\nsaving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. \r\nWe have seen a working agenda that has continuously \r\nexpanded into new areas of cooperation, within and \r\nbeyond its main pillars, namely, peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. We have witnessed \r\nthe continuous efforts of the Organization and its \r\nMember States to adapt to new challenges and to major \r\nshifts in the paradigm of international relations. As a \r\nconsequence, the United Nations has steadily developed \r\nnew mandates, reaching a level of complexity never \r\nseen before. Of course, the United Nations is not a \r\npanacea for all the evils of humankind. Its history is \r\none of ups and downs, achievements and failures. At the \r\nsame time, we all know that the increasing number and \r\ndepth of the tasks entrusted to it have not been matched \r\nby the resources needed to accomplish all of its goals. It \r\nhas become common practice to ask the United Nations \r\nto do more with less.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, after 70 years \r\nof being tested against all winds, has proved to \r\nbe a visionary document that has stood the test of \r\nhistory. The Charter was drafted as a solid corpus of \r\nprinciples and norms for international conduct. It was \r\nconceived in an intelligent manner that allowed enough \r\nf lexibility for designing the actual ways and means \r\nto cope with increasingly complex situations. The \r\nUnited Nations has steadily consolidated its universal \r\nvocation and legitimacy. It has created and promoted \r\nan impressive body of international law that touches \r\non almost all domains of international cooperation. \r\nIt may occasionally have been convenient for some \r\nMember States or other stakeholders to point to the \r\nfailures of the Organization. We should try harder to \r\npoint to the magnitude of the prevention work carried \r\nout by the Organization. Prevention being admittedly \r\nmuch more difficult to measure, we have tended to \r\nunderestimate its importance among the achievements \r\nof the Organization. In the same vein, it is worth \r\nreminding ourselves that the United Nations is neither \r\nan organization born out of the blue nor an independent \r\nand self-ruling entity. The United Nations is nothing \r\nbut we ourselves, the Member States, living in the trust \r\nand resources we invest in it. \r\nRomania is among the countries that have fully \r\ntrusted and unconditionally supported the United \r\nNations. The year 2015 is a special one for my country, \r\nbecause this year we celebrate the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof Romania’s admission to the Organization. The \r\nUnited Nations has helped Romania in various ways \r\nover various periods of the post-Second World War \r\nera. In the beginning, despite having been part of the \r\nmonolithic group of former Communist countries, \r\nRomania found in those years, a propitious framework, \r\nhere in the United Nations, within which to assert \r\nits national independence and to make friends and \r\npartners throughout the world. Later on, the United \r\nNations provided my country with the opportunity to \r\nengage in the debates over and action on global issues \r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation across all continents. \r\nIn the aftermath of the Cold War, the United Nations \r\nwas actively engaged in supporting Romania during \r\nits difficult economic transformation and the transition \r\ntowards democracy. The funds and programmes of the \r\nUnited Nations assisted Romania in addressing social \r\nproblems related to children, population, health and \r\nthe environment, along with many others. Allow me, \r\nin particular, to thank the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme for its 45-year presence in my country.\r\nOur sixtieth anniversary allows us to take a \r\nretrospective look. Romania is a country with limited \r\neconomic power. Nonetheless, we take pride in having \r\nmade some significant contributions to United Nations \r\ngoals throughout our six decades of membership. In \r\nessence, they were based on a reliance on multilateral \r\ndiplomacy and international law and the pre-eminence \r\nof peaceful means over the use of force in the pursuit of \r\nnational interests.\r\nRomania has often been at the frontline of major \r\nUnited Nations campaigns. I would like to highlight \r\njust a few of the topics that were the focus of initiatives \r\nundertaken by Romania in the General Assembly, the \r\nSecurity Council and the various human rights bodies. \r\nThey include, inter alia, arms control and disarmament, \r\ngood relations among neighbouring States, the role of \r\nscience and technology in development, a more effective \r\nand influential role for youth, increased cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nand arrangements, and the promotion and consolidation \r\nof democracy. Since 1991, Romanian contingents have \r\n18/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nparticipated in peacekeeping operations across all \r\ncontinents from Angola to Cambodia, from Somalia \r\nto Haiti, and from the former Yugoslavia to Rwanda. \r\nMoreover, Romania hosts the Institute for the Protection \r\nand the Security of the Citizen, which contributes to \r\nthe training of special categories of United Nations \r\npeacekeepers.\r\nSince 2008, Romania has been part of one of the \r\nmost innovative arrangements for the protection of \r\nrefugees through its hosting of the first Emergency \r\nTransit Centre in Timişoara, as a result of an \r\nagreement with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the International \r\nOrganization for Migration. After almost two decades \r\nas a recipient, Romania has thus itself become a \r\nprovider of official development assistance to countries \r\nin our neighbourhood and beyond.\r\nOn the occasion of its seventieth anniversary, the \r\nUnited Nations does not need to prove the legitimacy \r\nof its actions. What the Organization needs is a \r\nstrengthened capacity and readiness to act and galvanize \r\nthe political will of Member States, so as to be able to \r\nfurther enhance its role in maintaining international \r\npeace and security and in delivering global public \r\ngoods. That role is, once again, being dramatically \r\ntested these days.\r\nThe United Nations is called upon to make, in \r\nconcert with regional organizations and individual \r\nStates, new commitments to the fight against terrorism \r\nin all its manifestations — whether they be the \r\ncowardly crimes against innocent people, the barbarous \r\ndestruction of the common cultural heritage of \r\nhumankind, or the unprecedented and abhorrent form \r\nof terrorism developed by what is known as the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant, whose actions constitute \r\nclear violations of international law and human rights, \r\nwhich we are striving so hard to uphold.\r\nAt this juncture, let me reiterate Romania’s support \r\nfor the initiative of France and Mexico to propose \r\na collective and voluntary agreement among the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council regarding \r\nthe non-use of the veto when action is needed to prevent \r\nor bring to an end situations of mass atrocities and war \r\ncrimes on a large scale. Ten years after the endorsement \r\nof the responsibility to protect, we should continue to \r\nsupport that responsibility by identifying the best ways \r\nto understand, implement and operationalize it.\r\nThe current massive waves of migration are just \r\none of the worrisome consequences of the internal and \r\ninternational conflicts in the Middle East and Southern \r\nMediterranean region. That phenomenon requires more \r\nthan just responses to the immediate humanitarian needs \r\nof refugees. The United Nations must also address, in \r\na realistic and energetic manner, the root causes of \r\nmigration. We should stop the destruction of the social \r\nfabric of conflict-torn societies, help populations escape \r\ntheir extreme poverty, help youth regain their hope for a \r\nbetter future, and help individuals rebuild their dignity. \r\nThrough official development assistance (ODA), the \r\nUnited Nations should play a much stronger role in that \r\nrespect. For that to happen, a thorough reform of ODA \r\nmay probably be needed.\r\nThe United Nations should be less lenient in respect \r\nto the protracted conflicts in the Transnistrian region of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova, in Georgia and in Nagorno \r\nKarabakh. Where the status quo is characterized by \r\nconditions that are contrary to international law, the \r\nsituation will always be fragile and possibly conducive \r\nto occasional outbreaks of violence. In addition, \r\nour non-action in such situations creates the wrong \r\nimpression that unlawful territorial gains — to the \r\ndetriment of independent and sovereign States — are \r\npossible and tolerated. That is the case with the situation \r\nin Ukraine, in which the United Nations, and the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, have not taken the \r\naction expected, as defined by the terms of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. We call upon all members of \r\nthe Security Council to act responsibly and decide in \r\nthe interest of international peace and security and in \r\naccordance with international law, while addressing the \r\nsituation in Ukraine.\r\nRomania wholeheartedly welcomes the agreement \r\non the Iranian nuclear programme. That agreement \r\nproves that nothing is impossible, if there is a genuine \r\npolitical will and there are visionary statesmen engaged \r\nin bold action. We also praise the role so ably and \r\ndiligently played in that connection by the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency. The agreement with regard to \r\nthat long-standing problem proves once again the virtues \r\nof diplomacy and negotiations undertaken in good faith \r\nand with patience, with the support of the expertise \r\ndeveloped within the United Nations system. We hope \r\nto see more, ancillary benefits of that agreement in the \r\nbroader context of the Middle East peace process. \r\nI would like to call upon all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations not to miss the opportunity to conclude \r\n15-29431 19/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\na new and ambitious binding agreement in response \r\nto climate change. The moment is still auspicious, in \r\nview of the commitments of the European Union, as \r\nwell as the massive activism on the part of civil society. \r\nThe example of the European Union is expected to be \r\nfollowed by other major contributors to global warming. \r\nPeople everywhere and, in particular, those in the small \r\nisland countries, whose very physical existence is \r\nthreatened, are waiting for new commitments, before \r\nit is too late.\r\nBeyond the thematic and geographical configuration \r\nof United Nations diplomacy, we believe that the \r\nnuts and bolts of our Organization can be found in \r\nthe codification and progressive development of \r\ninternational law. Romania believes that international \r\nlaw and international justice are fundamental values for \r\nhumankind. We should never cease to act to promote \r\nthe reaffirmation and consolidation of the principles of \r\ninternational law, which represent a landmark of our \r\nsociety of nations for all time. \r\nThe sixtieth anniversary of Romania’s admission \r\nto the United Nations is being marked as an important \r\nstep concerning our commitment to international \r\njustice. Romania became the seventy-second Member \r\nState to accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Our declaration, \r\nsubmitted to the Secretary-General on 23 June, is a \r\ncontinuation of the interwar tradition of my country to \r\nconduct its international relations in full compliance \r\nwith international law. \r\nThe consolidation of international justice and \r\nthe need to put an end to impunity should trigger \r\na strengthened legal approach to international \r\nterrorism. Terrorism represents the worst in crimes \r\nagainst individuals and societies. Romania believes \r\nthat the international community should do more to \r\ncombat terrorism with the tools of the law, including \r\ninternational criminal law. It is with that purpose in mind \r\nthat Romania and Spain have set in motion a process of \r\nreflection on the possible creation of an international \r\ncourt for the crime of terrorism. We are fully aware of \r\nthe conceptual and operational difficulties of such an \r\nundertaking. However, the values that stand behind that \r\nreflection, which are aimed at strengthening the rule \r\nof law in our multilateral antiterrorist drive, are likely \r\nto generate fresh ideas for innovative legal tools. We \r\nbelieve that that reflection process is worthwhile in its \r\nown right, as it will fuel the debate on reinforcing the \r\nvalues of justice and international law. I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to invite all interested delegations \r\nto engage in good-faith discussions about how to \r\nimplement those values in the fight against terrorism.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Romania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Head of \r\nState of the Kingdom of Swaziland.\r\nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Majesty King \r\nMswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of Swaziland, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Mswati III: It is a great pleasure for me to \r\naddress the General Assembly of the United Nations as \r\nwe celebrate the seventieth anniversary of our global \r\nOrganization. It is important, at this time, that we \r\nrevisit the founding objectives of the United Nations \r\nto determine whether we have been able to live up to \r\nwhat they have required of us since its establishment. \r\nPrimarily, the United Nations was set up to promote \r\npeace and stability among humankind and to assist \r\nnations to develop socially and economically, to \r\nmention but a few of the founding objectives. This \r\nannual session gives us an opportunity to review and \r\nrecommit ourselves to the objectives laid out by our \r\npredecessors.\r\nTremendous progress has been made on a number \r\nof social fronts, while growth in the economies and \r\nthe development of nations is evident. However, that \r\nsuccess has come with its own challenges that need to \r\nbe addressed in a spirit of global cooperation in order \r\nto achieve the ultimate goal of peaceful progress and \r\ndevelopment that leaves nobody behind. We urge the \r\nUnited Nations to continue to play its role in fostering \r\na collective approach to overcoming all impediments.\r\n20/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nThe capabilities and successes of the United \r\nNations are well documented. We have seen the United \r\nNations play a significant role in resolving conflicts on \r\nthe African continent and in other parts of the world. \r\nThe role of the United Nations in curbing the Ebola \r\noutbreak is appreciated. While we have not eradicated \r\nthe disease completely, we applaud the Organization’s \r\ntremendous efforts to stem its spread. We also commend \r\nthe United Nations for launching such initiatives as the \r\nGlobal Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, \r\nwhich has played a significant role in combating those \r\ndiseases. We appeal to the United Nations to continue \r\nhelping Africa emerge from the cycle of poverty and \r\ndisease as the continent seeks to fulfil its Agenda 2063, \r\nwhich seeks to eradicate poverty and create prosperity \r\nfor all.\r\nAfrica has great potential for investment. What \r\nremains is to create the requisite environment for \r\neconomic growth. We strongly believe that the United \r\nNations system can establish a peaceful global village \r\nfree of fear and violence. We adopted the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), aiming to emancipate \r\nhumankind from poverty and hunger by creating \r\nprosperity in a safe and peaceful environment that \r\noffers acceptable basic living standards (resolution \r\n55/2). We are pleased to observe that our decision has, \r\nby and large, yielded positive outcomes that live up to \r\nthe founding principles of the United Nations.\r\nThe impressive progress witnessed during the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs makes us confident that \r\nthe new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) will enjoy even greater success. \r\nWe have good reason to anticipate a sustainable \r\ntransformation of nations over the next 15 years. Our \r\npresence here should signify a renewed commitment to \r\nour resolve.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini is one of many nations \r\nto report significant progress in the implementation \r\nof the MDGs. That progress has been guided by \r\na people-driven road map leading us towards our \r\nSwaziland Vision 2022, which is designed to propel the \r\nKingdom to become a developed country, a development \r\nState. We are very much aware of the challenges that \r\nlie ahead on the journey, but I have full confidence in \r\nthe capabilities of our people. They have worked very \r\nhard over the years to bring us to where we are today. \r\nAlthough we may not have an abundance of natural \r\nresources, we do have an innovative and educated \r\nworkforce that is united in a common purpose.\r\nWith Africa opening up new trade markets and \r\ninvestment opportunities, the Kingdom of eSwatini \r\nhas fast-tracked reforms that have yielded improved \r\nease of doing business. Infrastructure development has \r\nalso improved direct access to global markets through \r\nthe completion of our new international airport, while \r\nproviding multiple investment opportunities in its \r\nimmediate surroundings. We believe that the airport \r\nwill give rise to downstream projects that can create \r\nemployment opportunities and add the required impetus \r\nto our economic growth.\r\nAccess to markets of the developed world remains \r\ncritical for Africa, which is well endowed with mineral \r\nresources yet still faces the challenges of poverty, \r\nhunger and unemployment. The support of the United \r\nNations is essential if we are to successfully deal with \r\nthe mammoth task of developing infrastructure so \r\nthat we can add value to our natural resources. The \r\nsuccess of trade and investment also hinges heavily on \r\na reliable and sustainable supply of energy. As a result, \r\nwe now have a comprehensive strategy and programme \r\nof action that outline the gaps that need to be addressed \r\nby all players in the energy sector. They present viable \r\nopportunities for investment in that sector, particularly \r\nin renewable energy.\r\nAs we envisage a world free of poverty, hunger, \r\ndisease and want, where all life can thrive, it becomes \r\ncritical to make youth empowerment central to \r\nachieving that goal. Attaining a 97 per cent enrolment \r\nrate in primary education is a significant milestone \r\nfor our country as we seek to ensure education for all. \r\nSustainable education requires that that high enrolment \r\nshould be complemented by quality education that is \r\nfurther accessible at the secondary, higher and tertiary \r\nlevels.\r\nWe remain challenged in meeting that requirement, \r\nand we call upon our global friends to partner with us \r\nto ensure that we do not become victims of our own \r\nsuccess. We are recognizing and rewarding outstanding \r\neducational talent through entrepreneurial development \r\ninitiatives at the secondary and tertiary levels. We trust \r\nthat those initiatives, among many others, will produce \r\na future generation that is equipped with the life skills \r\nneeded to provide solutions to the socioeconomic \r\nchallenges facing many of our unemployed youth today. \r\nThe Kingdom is also developing innovation parks that \r\nwill provide our young people with the creative skills \r\nneeded to enable them to contribute to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the country.\r\n15-29431 21/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which has stretched our \r\nhealth resources to the limit, remains a challenge that \r\nrequires our collective effort. As a nation, we have \r\ntaken a decision that we want to become one of the \r\nfirst African countries with a generalized epidemic to \r\nachieve an AIDS-free generation in 2022 — a vision \r\nthat is in line with the global agenda to end AIDS by \r\n2030.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini still largely relies on \r\nagriculture as a means to sustain itself and prosper. \r\nProgrammes aimed at increasing food production, \r\nending hunger and improving nutrition have been \r\ndeveloped. A farm input-subsidy programme aimed at \r\nincreasing yields through the availability of tractors, \r\nseeds and fertilizer is now in place. The country has \r\nalso invested heavily in building dams to harness water, \r\nand we hope that friends of the Kingdom will continue \r\nto partner with us in building more such facilities. The \r\ndams are helping many of our people to irrigate their \r\ncrops. We look to international financial institutions to \r\nsupport those initiatives. We are concerned, however, \r\nthat some of that support attaches stringent conditions \r\nwith consequences that leave the recipient countries \r\nworse off. We therefore appeal to the United Nations to \r\naddress that phenomenon, which seriously undermines \r\nthe objectives of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nWe are very aware that, working alone, we are \r\nlimited in our success. It is, therefore, important \r\nthat the developed countries of the world support the \r\ngrowth of developing nations like ours. We appeal to \r\ndonor countries to increase their funding to smaller \r\nnations so that they can strengthen their capacity to \r\ncreate jobs and address existing social challenges. Only \r\nwhen our communities achieve better living conditions \r\nwill developing countries enjoy the peace and stability \r\nthat provides the requisite environment for sustainable \r\ngrowth.\r\nThe effects of climate change have not gone \r\nunnoticed, nor have they left us unharmed. Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 11 calls for urgent action to combat \r\nclimate change and its impacts. We continue to urge \r\nour developed partners not only to fulfil their pledges \r\nto the Green Fund but also to adopt policies that \r\nstrike the correct balance among the requirements for \r\nthe production of essential products, profits and the \r\nsustainability of our environment. Anything less would \r\nseriously jeopardize the ideals of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nWe look forward to a legally binding global climate \r\nagreement at the United Nations Climate Change \r\nConference in France later this year.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini continues to enjoy the \r\npeace and stability that all people on the globe deserve. \r\nThe secret to our success has been consultation and \r\ndialogue aimed at building consensus, which is a model \r\nof peace that has a place in the implementation of \r\nUnited Nations operations. It is apparent that military \r\nintervention in resolving conflict has a short-term \r\neffect that leaves the people that it is meant to serve \r\nworse off. Only a peaceful solution to conflict can yield \r\nsustainable conclusions to the current crises facing \r\nvarious parts of the world today. That calls for us to \r\nunite and to bring the warring parties to the table for \r\ndialogue.\r\nHowever, for that to be truly effective, we need \r\nthe United Nations to ensure that any intervention is \r\nundertaken by a united body. If the United Nations is \r\ndivided on the mandates that it creates to deal with \r\nchallenges that require a collective approach, it runs the \r\nrisk of worsening the problems. It is critical that, when \r\nthe Members of the United Nations are confronted with \r\nconflict situations, they resolve them with one voice.\r\nThe protracted war in Syria remains a huge challenge \r\nfor the United Nations. One of its consequences has \r\nbeen the serious refugee crisis that we have today, \r\naffecting neighbouring countries and, most recently, \r\nvarious European States. We applaud all the countries \r\nthat have accepted the refugees and provided them with \r\nfood and shelter, and we appeal to the Syrian people to \r\ncome together to find a peaceful and lasting solution \r\nto their differences. There can be only one solution to \r\nthat predicament, which is to resolve the source of the \r\nconflict so that all of the people of Syria are able to \r\nbenefit from the peace they deserve. It is imperative \r\nthat the objectives of the United Nations be met. One \r\nimportant aim of the United Nations is to work to rid \r\nsociety of all hostilities. We have put conflict-resolution \r\nmechanisms in place, and it is our duty to ensure that \r\nthey are implemented effectively.\r\nWe trust that, as we proceed with the 2030 Agenda, \r\nwe will fully embrace an all-inclusive approach. \r\nWe therefore urge the United Nations to give every \r\ncountry in the world the opportunity to contribute to \r\nthe global community in whatever form and capacity \r\nit can. In that regard, we appeal to the United Nations \r\nto consider admitting the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nto membership. Like every other country, it has the \r\n22/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\npotential to contribute positively to the global agenda, \r\nin its case in such areas as health care and information \r\nand communications technology, to mention only a few.\r\nThe inclusiveness espoused by the United Nations \r\nshould encompass representation in the key bodies of \r\nthe Organization. The African continent continues to \r\nappeal for a permanent seat on the Security Council \r\nthrough which its voice will be fully represented, as \r\noutlined in the Ezulwini Consensus. We trust that the \r\nmatter will receive the attention it deserves.\r\nFinally, I would like once again to extend my \r\nheartiest congratulations to the entire United Nations \r\nfamily for its attainment of 70 years of togetherness. We \r\nwish to commend all United Nations agencies for their \r\nsustained efforts to fulfil the ideals of the Organization, \r\nwhich have benefited humankind in many ways. Let us \r\nrenew our commitment to the objectives of our global \r\nOrganization. We have grown in numbers, and that has \r\ngiven rise to new paradigms. We are certain that, with \r\nthe correct mindset, that will be addressed accordingly. \r\nHowever, it is important to realize that, as much as \r\nour goals may be universal, we do not share the same \r\ncapabilities and capacities for implementing them. May \r\nAlmighty God bless us all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nHead of State of the Kingdom of Swaziland for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Mswati III, Head of State of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai \r\nKoroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Koroma: I would like to warmly \r\ncongratulate the President on his election to conduct \r\nthe affairs of the Assembly at its historic seventieth \r\nsession. I can assure him of my personal support \r\nand that of Sierra Leone during his tenure. I would \r\nalso like to convey my sincere appreciation to his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, for the effective way in which he \r\nled the previous session. And I heartily commend the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his constructive leadership of our Organization. \r\nSierra Leone will continue to support progressive \r\nimplementation of his laudable Five-Year Action \r\nAgenda, announced on 25 January 2012. We also \r\nwelcome his synthesizing report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/70/1), which articulates a call to action \r\nto transform our world beyond 2015.\r\nSeventy years ago, we committed to promoting \r\nsocial progress and better standards of life in larger \r\nfreedom. Today, that is still our task and common \r\ngoal, and the very foundation in which our shared \r\nand common values are firmly embedded and should \r\ntherefore be respected. It is in the pursuit of that task \r\nand our shared values that, 15 years ago, the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2) articulated a bold vision \r\nto eradicate extreme poverty, promote gender equality \r\nand ensure that children everywhere receive a basic \r\neducation. Together, we have achieved a lot, getting \r\nmillions out of poverty, getting millions into schools \r\nand breaking down many barriers to the empowerment \r\nof women. But our achievements are works in progress, \r\nas is our Organization. Many challenges still remain.\r\nMany actions need to be taken in the offices of our \r\nOrganization, and many actions must be taken in the \r\nfield where the citizens of the world lead their lives. \r\nThe two are interlinked. Without changes within the \r\nstructures of our global Organization, our actions in the \r\nfield will be hindered by the lack of ownership, lack \r\nof inclusion and lack of irreversible successes. That \r\nis why we commend the President for the choice and \r\nrelevance of the theme of this session: “The United \r\nNations at 70 — a new commitment to action”. We have \r\nput forward negotiating positions for reform in our \r\nOrganization, we have drawn up plans for achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and we \r\nadopted the financing for development framework in \r\nAddis Ababa in July. What is left now for us to do is \r\nto take action on all these fronts: to continue action to \r\nreform our Organization, to commence action in areas \r\n15-29431 23/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nwhere there has not yet been action, to take action to \r\novercome challenges, and to follow through on action \r\nto sustain, deepen and expand our achievements.\r\nThe unfinished business of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and its accompanying challenges \r\nare critical to the work that lies ahead. We have \r\nlearned lessons that are invaluable, and we have made \r\nundeniable progress. But the challenges we still face \r\nare seen in the millions not going to school, the millions \r\nnot having health care, the millions of women who are \r\noppressed, and the millions of people whose rights and \r\nlives are being trampled upon in the war zones and on \r\nthe refugee routes of the world. The challenges have the \r\nurgency of a life-and-death situation for millions.\r\nWhat we see the world over — in the refugee crisis, \r\nin the fight against poverty, transnational organized \r\ncrime, terrorism, proliferation of small arms and \r\nlight weapons, piracy, violence against women, in our \r\nactions to uphold human rights, and in the efforts for \r\nexpanding access to health and education — what we \r\nsee are struggles to promote inclusion in the better \r\nachievements of humankind: achievements in the \r\nareas of security, safety, peace, education, health and \r\ndevelopment. Where there is exclusion, people seek \r\ninclusion. The poor seek inclusion in a fairer world, and \r\nrefugees seek inclusion in a safer world. We believe that \r\nthe SDGs are about building a fairer, safer and better \r\nworld for those excluded from the great achievements \r\nof humankind.\r\nMaking our global Organization more democratic, \r\nmore participatory and fairer is part of the struggle for \r\ninclusion the world over. It is a prerequisite for achieving \r\nour universal aspirations as expressed in the 2030 \r\nSustainable Development Agenda (resolution 70/1). As \r\nthe Coordinator of the African Union Committee of Ten \r\nHeads of State and Government on the Reform of the \r\nUnited Nations Security Council, I take this opportunity \r\nto emphasize once again the need for urgent reform of \r\nthe Council and again echo Africa’s concern over the \r\nfailure of the General Assembly to adopt measures that \r\nwill lead to a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nI wish to call attention to the regrettable status quo \r\nthat undermines the principles of equity, legitimacy, \r\naccountability and transparency. The current state \r\nof affairs also undermines the effectiveness of the \r\nSecurity Council in its pursuit of international peace \r\nand security. The need to address the issue of Africa’s \r\nnon-representation in the permanent category and its \r\nunderrepresentation in the non-permanent category is \r\nlong overdue and therefore now imperative. Africa’s \r\ndemand for two permanent seats and two additional \r\nnon-permanent seats as articulated in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration is just and \r\nprovides a framework for a fairer and more inclusive \r\nUnited Nations. I welcome the recent adoption of \r\nresolution 69/321, designed, inter alia, to further the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation process, and I very much \r\nhope that meaningful progress will be made towards \r\na consensus-building mechanism in the course of this \r\nseventieth session.\r\nSierra Leone is very committed to promoting \r\ninclusion in governance and in development and to \r\nfurthering peace around the world. We shall continue \r\nto support initiatives to sustain and expand democracy, \r\npeace and security, in Africa in particular, and in the \r\nworld at large. The contribution of Sierra Leone to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping efforts demonstrates our \r\nstrong commitment to global peace and stability. We \r\nacknowledge the report of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations on uniting our strengths for \r\npeace: politics, partnership and people (A/70/95). We \r\nstand ready to explore further ways of increasing our \r\ncontribution to global peacekeeping in order to enhance \r\nthe success of United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nI take this opportunity to pay a special tribute to the \r\nmen and women in uniform, as well as to civilian staff, \r\nwho continue to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve \r\nhumankind in complex and dangerous environments \r\naround the world. We totally condemn attacks against \r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers, and we call for action \r\nagainst the perpetrators of these cowardly acts.\r\nThe report of the Advisory Group of Experts for \r\nthe 2015 Review of the United Nations Peacebuilding \r\nArchitecture and its recommendations is a useful \r\ndocument that informs us of lessons learned, best \r\npractices and the challenges ahead in terms of preventing \r\nrelapses into violent conflict. We look forward to \r\nconstructive engagement in the intergovernmental \r\nprocess in the light of the fact that Sierra Leone is one \r\nof the case studies and a storehouse of lessons learned.\r\nWe applaud our collective establishment of the \r\nResidual Special Court for Sierra Leone for the purpose \r\nof carrying out the continuing legal obligations of the \r\noriginal Special Court. Given the profile of persons \r\nconvicted by the Court and those currently serving \r\nprison sentences under the supervision of the Residual \r\n24/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nCourt, it is in the interest of international peace and \r\nsecurity and in furtherance of justice that we extend \r\nsupport to the effective operations of the Residual Court \r\nin order to enable it to fully deliver on its mandate.\r\nWhether it be terrorism, climate change, disease \r\nor refugees, no country is immune from the challenges \r\nfacing the world at large. Some countries may be able \r\nto keep some of these problems from reaching their \r\nshores. However, our globalized world has multiplied \r\nthe routes along which these challenges move, going \r\nfrom country to country, from one region to another, \r\nfrom one group of people to another. That is why we \r\ncannot say a particular problem is only a problem \r\nfor this country or that region. Poorer countries \r\nsuffer disproportionately from particular problems \r\nbut, without support from the world to solve them, \r\nthe problems spread and haunt other regions, other \r\ncountries and other groups. We need to incorporate that \r\npiece of wisdom into decision-making in every country, \r\nevery region and every global organization.\r\nThat is also the piece of wisdom we need to \r\nincorporate into our decisions about climate change. \r\nChanges in the weather patterns in the Pacific and in \r\nthe ocean currents of the North Atlantic are unleashing \r\ndevastating f loods in many places. A week and a \r\nhalf ago, we witnessed f loods of proportions hitherto \r\nunseen in Sierra Leone, which devastated many parts \r\nof our capital, Freetown. Storms rage in the Cape Verde \r\nIslands and f loods have ravaged other parts of West \r\nAfrica. We believe that our experts are right when they \r\nattribute those disasters to man-made climate change.\r\nWe call for action, not only to lower emissions \r\nof greenhouse gases, which are implicated in those \r\nchanges, but also to shore up capabilities to deal with \r\nthe effects of climate change. No country, I reiterate, \r\nis immune from the physical, social, health and \r\nother consequences of climate change. We need to \r\nintegrate that insight into our decisions about other \r\nurgent matters — youth unemployment, insecurity, \r\nextreme hunger, violence against women, transnational \r\norganized crime and piracy. Allowing these to get out of \r\ncontrol in vulnerable nations increases the vulnerability \r\nof all nations.\r\nAfrica has made efforts to strengthen the \r\ncontinent’s capacity for preventing and resolving \r\nconflicts. Countries in the global South have also been \r\nat the forefront of finding solutions and providing relief \r\nfrom the miseries of the world. They host more refugees \r\nthan other lands; they contribute more personnel to \r\npeacekeeping missions. Global solidarity is imperative \r\nin building our regional capacity to better handle those \r\nchallenges. Without that solidarity, the challenges will \r\njump across borders, evade immigration controls and \r\nleap over walls. That is why we need cooperative and \r\ncoordinated partnerships to strengthen the capacities \r\nto respond to those challenges. Our voice, as fragile \r\nand conflict-affected States under the Group of Seven \r\nPlus, is a call for country ownership and country-led \r\nimplementation of the SDGs.\r\nSince 2012, Sierra Leone has been proactively \r\ntailoring its development framework in anticipation \r\nof the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). The implementation of \r\nour national vision for socioeconomic development, \r\nas contained in the Government’s poverty reduction \r\nstrategy paper and articulated in the Agenda for \r\nProsperity, was launched in July 2013 as Sierra Leone’s \r\nroad map for the post-2015 development agenda. The \r\nAgenda for Prosperity aims to build a sustainable \r\nfuture for all Sierra Leoneans. It demonstrates our firm \r\ncommitment to putting Sierra Leone on the path to \r\nresilience and sustainability.\r\nTo that end, we have recorded significant progress \r\nin strengthening political and economic governance, \r\nincluding the improvement of social indicators. My \r\nGovernment has continued to place emphasis on the \r\nprotection of the basic rights of the people of Sierra \r\nLeone. We have put in place comprehensive reforms \r\nin the justice sector, in response to both national and \r\nglobal demands, to ensure that the rights of citizens \r\nare preserved and that access to justice is accorded \r\nto all. The Human Rights Commission of Sierra \r\nLeone is closely collaborating with the Government \r\nto ensure that a human rights culture is entrenched in \r\nour society and that the Government ratifies several \r\ninternational treaties and protocols whose ratification \r\nis still outstanding and fulfils its various reporting \r\nobligations.\r\nWe have undertaken specific reform measures \r\nto improve the national investment climate. My \r\nGovernment is keen on delivering results in several \r\npriority areas, including infrastructure development, \r\ncommercial agriculture, improved access to education \r\nand health-care services, youth empowerment and \r\nemployment, women’s empowerment, effective and \r\nefficient public service delivery and the social and \r\npolitical integration of persons with disabilities.\r\n15-29431 25/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nAt a time when Sierra Leone was being commended \r\nfor its remarkable progress with respect to peace, \r\nstability and steady economic growth, we were hit by \r\nthe unprecedented Ebola virus outbreak, which took \r\na heavy toll on the entire socioeconomic fabric of \r\nSierra Leone. However, we fought back, with support \r\nfrom our international friends, and have now almost \r\ndefeated the evil virus, with zero cases being recorded \r\nfor several days in September. As we make progress \r\nto end the epidemic, I wish to commend the United \r\nNations agencies and the international community \r\nfor their support and their commitment to ending the \r\nepidemic, as well as their support for the post-Ebola \r\nrecovery plan.\r\nI particularly commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor mobilizing, for the very first time, a coordinated \r\nand integrated United Nations system intervention to \r\nsupport countries affected by the outbreak of the Ebola \r\nvirus disease in our region. In addition to containing \r\nthe epidemic, the intervention of the United Nations and \r\nour partners has resulted in an enhanced preparedness \r\nto respond to similar outbreaks in the future. That \r\nis a useful model that can be applied to contain and \r\ntackle pandemics wherever they may surface. In order \r\nto guarantee a lasting recovery, my Government, in \r\ncollaboration with our sister Republics of Guinea and \r\nLiberia, have also formulated a subregional post-Ebola \r\nsocioeconomic recovery plan to ensure that the three \r\nmost Ebola-affected countries return to the path of \r\nstability and prosperity.\r\nThe Sierra Leone National Recovery Plan is based \r\non two main pillars. The first pillar concentrates on \r\nimmediate recovery activities, including maintaining \r\nzero infections. The second pillar focuses on building \r\nresilient and sustainable national systems , including \r\na viable health system, and establishing an integrated \r\nnational security and disaster risk management system.\r\nI must state, with a considerable measure of \r\nsatisfaction, that the international community’s \r\ncommitment to supporting the Ebola recovery plans has \r\nbeen very encouraging. On behalf of the Government and \r\nthe people of Sierra Leone, allow me, Sir, to once again \r\napplaud our development partners for their unwavering \r\ncommitment of support to Sierra Leone’s development \r\naspirations. Sierra Leone is poised and ready to continue \r\nworking with the international community to resume \r\nits pre-Ebola development trajectory. We look forward \r\nto strengthening our partnerships for the effective \r\nimplementation of our post-Ebola recovery plans, both \r\nnational and subregional.\r\nIn conclusion, as our noble Organization celebrates \r\nits seventieth anniversary this year, it is important to \r\nreflect on the Charter, which reaffirms \r\n“faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity \r\nand worth of the human person, in the equal rights \r\nof men and women and of nations large or small”. \r\nWith the commitment of leaving no one behind, we \r\nmust objectively follow a pragmatic approach, with \r\nrenewed vigour and resolve, to provide a future for our \r\npeople that will guarantee justice, sustainable peace and \r\nsecurity, accountability and democratic governance, \r\nemployment opportunities, the transparent and \r\nequitable distribution of wealth, a safe and sustainable \r\nenvironment, improved health and relevant education. \r\nIt is also important to ensure that conflicts are resolved \r\naround the world, if the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nare to be achieved, as no development can take place \r\nwithout peace.\r\nTogether, let us rise to that challenge with greater \r\nresolve, and take action to create a fairer, safer and \r\nbetter world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Sierra Leone for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Petro Poroshenko, \r\nPresident of Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nUkraine.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Petro \r\nPoroshenko, President of Ukraine, and to invite him to \r\naddress the General Assembly. \r\nPresident Poroshenko: On behalf of Ukraine, I \r\nsincerely congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his \r\n26/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session, and wish him every success in his \r\nactivities at this crucial historic moment. Our future \r\nwill largely depend on the outcomes of this session \r\nand our collective decisions — whether we choose to \r\nfollow the path of peace, security and human rights, or \r\nto plunge into the turmoil of new hybrid wars, chaos \r\nand suffering.\r\nOn the ocasion of this seventieth anniversary, I am \r\nproud to speak on behalf of one of the founding members \r\nof the United Nations, a State that, back in 1945, took an \r\nactive part in the San Francisco Conference, helped to \r\nestablish the Organization and lay down the foundation \r\nfor its activities, a State whose contribution back then \r\nwas of importance in shaping the core of the United \r\nNations: the Purposes and Principles of its Charter. \r\nRegrettably, I am also speaking on behalf of a State \r\nMember of the United Nations that is now the victim \r\nof a brutal violation of the fundamental norms and \r\nprinciples of that Charter. The statement by Ukraine \r\nupon its joining the United Nations as one of its founding \r\nMembers, which was delivered at the San Francisco \r\nConference, emphasized that Ukraine had repeatedly \r\nbeen the subject of bloody invasions by aggressors that \r\nfor centuries had sought to capture its territory. \r\nA long time has passed since that landmark \r\nevent. But, today, I have to recall that my country has \r\nbecome the object of external aggression. This time, \r\nthe aggressor is the Russian Federation, a neighbouring \r\ncountry and a former strategic partner, which legally \r\npledged to respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity, \r\nindependence and inviolability of the borders of \r\nUkraine. That country used to be a guarantor of \r\nUkraine’s security under the Budapest Memorandum, \r\nwhereby security guarantees were provided to my \r\ncountry in exchange for the voluntary renunciation \r\nof the world’s third nuclear arsenal. Moreover, it is a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council, which is \r\nentrusted by the Charter of the United Nations with the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIn February 2014, Russia conducted an open and \r\nunprovoked aggression against my country, occupying \r\nand annexing the Crimea, wantonly and brutally \r\nviolating international law and shocking the whole world \r\ncommunity. I am deeply grateful to the delegations of \r\nthe majority of the States Members of our Organization \r\nfor supporting resolution 68/262, entitled “Territorial \r\nintegrity of Ukraine”, which condemned the illegal \r\nRussian annexation of the Crimea. It is regrettable \r\nthat this clear verdict of the international community \r\nfailed to persuade Russia to return to the civilized \r\nsphere of international law. Moreover, Moscow started \r\na new reckless military game — this time, in Ukraine’s \r\nDonbas region.\r\nDespite the fact that Russia is still refusing to \r\nofficially acknowledge its direct military invasion, there \r\ncan be no doubt that an aggressive war is being waged \r\nagainst my country. To mislead the world community, \r\nthe Russian leadership orders its military servicemen \r\nto remove their insignias and the identification marks \r\non military equipment. It orders the abandonment of \r\nits soldiers captured on the battlefield and the cynical \r\nuse of mobile crematoriums to eliminate traces of its \r\ncrimes on Ukrainian soil.\r\nI would like to stress that neither a civil war nor \r\nan internal conflict is taking place. Russia’s occupation \r\nof Ukrainian territory in the Crimea and the Donbas \r\nregion covers approximately 44,000 square kilometres, \r\nand millions of Ukrainians are under that occupation. \r\nThe goal of the current war is to force the Ukrainian \r\npeople to give up their sovereign choice to build a \r\nfree, democratic, prosperous and European State. All \r\nthat is taking place against a backdrop of traitorous \r\nrhetoric about brotherly peoples, sharing a common \r\nhistory, related languages and a predestined common \r\nfuture. In actual fact, we are dealing here with a desire \r\nto return to imperial times, with spheres of influence, \r\nand a desperate attempt to obtain self-affirmation at \r\nanother’s expense. \r\nFor over 20 months, the aggression against my \r\ncountry has been fuelled by Russia’s financing of \r\nterrorists and mercenaries and its supplying of arms and \r\nmilitary equipment to illegal armed groups in Donbas. \r\nOver the past few days, we have heard a conciliatory \r\nstatement from the Russian side, including a call for \r\nthe establishment of an anti-terrorist coalition and a \r\nwarning that fraternizing with terrorists would pour \r\noil on the f lames. That was an impressive but hard-to-\r\nbelieve story.\r\nHow can a country call for an anti-terrorist coalition \r\nwhen it is inspiring terrorism so close to home? How \r\ncan it talk about peace and legitimacy, if its policy is \r\nto wage war through puppet governments? How can it \r\nspeak of national autonomy, if it punishes a neighbour \r\nfor making a choice? How can it demand respect for all, \r\nif it respects no one? The Gospel of St. John teaches \r\n15-29431 27/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nus that in the beginning there was the word; but what \r\nkind of Gospel is one following if all one’s words are \r\nso duplicitous?\r\nLet us return to the situation in Donbas, where, I \r\nhave to say, we are being forced to fight fully armed \r\ntroops belonging to regular units of the Russian armed \r\nforces. Heavy weaponry and military equipment are \r\nconcentrated in the occupied territories in quantities \r\nsuch as the armies of the majority of Member States \r\ncan only dream about. In particular, various pieces \r\nof state-of-the-art military equipment that were \r\nmanufactured in Russia are to be found among that \r\nsame weaponry and, contrary to the public assertion \r\nof the Russian President, are unlikely to be available \r\nfor sale in a regular wholesale army store, unless, of \r\ncourse, it was located in the Russian Federation and \r\nprovided free shipping. \r\nDuring the period in question, over 8,000 \r\nUkrainians, of whom 6,000 were civilians, died at the \r\nhands of the Russian-backed terrorists and occupiers in \r\nUkraine and Donbas. More than 1.5 million residents \r\nof Donbas were forced to f lee their homes and, moving \r\nto safer regions within Ukraine, became internally \r\ndisplaced persons. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto express my gratitude to the international community \r\nfor making such a considerable effort to provide \r\nassistance to those in need. \r\nAt the same time, I call on the United Nations and \r\nother international actors to continue to pay special \r\nattention to that very important issue. I would like to \r\ndraw everyone’s attention to the fact that this is not \r\nthe first time that the same permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council is undermining peace and security at \r\nboth the regional and the international level. \r\nOver the past 24 years, ever since the questionable \r\ntransfer of permanent membership on the Security \r\nCouncil from the former Soviet Union to the Russian \r\nFederation, the conflict in Ukraine is but one of several \r\nhybrid wars that Russia has unleashed. In fact, in order \r\nto preserve its influence in neighbouring countries, \r\nRussia, for decades, has deliberately created, and \r\nsurrounded itself with, a belt of instability, made up \r\nof Nagorno Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia, South \r\nOssetia, Crimea and Donbas — all regions involving \r\nprotracted conflicts and supported by or directly related \r\nto Russia. But the Kremlin has gone even further. \r\nToday, the Russian men in green are treading on Syrian \r\nland. What and who are next? \r\nIn every democratic country, if one party steals \r\nanother party’s property, an independent court restores \r\njustice by enforcing the rights of the aggrieved party and \r\npunishing the offender. Yet, here we are in the twenty-\r\nfirst century and our Organization is still without an \r\neffective instrument to bring an aggressor country \r\nto justice, a country which has stolen the territory of \r\nanother sovereign State. Seventy years ago, the authors \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations envisaged that \r\nsanctions imposed by the Security Council would be \r\none of the punishments applied in response to breaches \r\nof peace and acts of aggression. \r\nHowever, they would have been hard put to imagine \r\na situation in which that punishment needs to be \r\napplied against an aggressor State that is a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council. Since the beginning \r\nof the aggression, Russia has used its right of veto \r\ntwice during the Council’s consideration of questions \r\nrelated to Ukraine. At the outset, Russia blocked a \r\ndraft resolution (S/2014/189) that condemned the fake \r\nreferendum on Crimea’s annexation in March 2014. \r\nAt that very moment, in my capacity as a Ukrainian \r\nmember of Parliament, I was there when the Russians \r\nsaid that there was a vote on this same fake referendum. \r\nNo member of Parliament was present. On the contrary, \r\nthere were only Russian soldiers surrounding the \r\nParliament of Crimea. \r\nThe second time that Russia used its right of veto \r\nwas to block a draft resolution (S/2015/562) that would \r\nhave established an international tribunal to investigate \r\nand bring to justice all those responsible for the crash \r\nof Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17. By its disgraceful \r\nuse of the veto on that draft resolution, Russia clearly \r\ndemonstrated to the whole world its defiance and its \r\nunwillingness to establish the truth — not just the truth \r\nabout the perpetrators of that terrorist attack and the \r\narms that were used to shot down that plane, but, more \r\nimportant, the truth concerning those who organized \r\nthat crime and the country from which those arms had \r\nbeen transported. I think that everyone in this Hall \r\nclearly understands the real motives of Russia’s use of \r\nthe veto on a draft resolution concerning a tribunal to \r\ninvestigate Flight MH-17. Moreover, a draft resolution \r\non the establishment of an international peacekeeping \r\noperation, whose purpose would have been to stabilize \r\nthe situation in Ukraine and stop the bloodshed, was \r\nalso blocked because of the potential threat of Russia’s \r\nuse of the veto. \r\n28/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nAbuse of the right of veto — its use as a licence \r\nto kill — is absolutely unacceptable (see S/PV.7384). \r\nThe Organization should make its collective voice \r\nheard clearly on this subject. For its part, Ukraine \r\nstands for the gradual limitation of the right of veto, \r\nwith its eventual abolition. The right of veto should not \r\nexercised randomly or to grant a pardon or clemency \r\nin cases where crimes have been committed and merit \r\nappropriate punishment. \r\nIn that context, I welcome the proposal of my \r\nFrench colleague and friend, President Hollande, \r\nsupported by President Peña Nieto of Mexico, aimed at \r\nregulating the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. \r\nPrimary attention should be given to the modernization \r\nof the Security Council, including the enlargement of \r\nits membership and the improvement of its working \r\nmethods. The membership of the Security Council \r\nshould reflect the realities of the twenty-first century \r\nand include a higher number of African, Asian and \r\nLatin American States. An additional non-permanent \r\nseat on the Council should be given to the Eastern \r\nEuropean Group, as its membership has doubled over \r\nthe past two decades. \r\nUkraine also considers improvement of the \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding architecture of the \r\nOrganization an important element of United Nations \r\nreform. I am proud of Ukraine’s international reputation \r\nas an active and devoted contributor to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. Despite external challenges, \r\nwe remain a reliable partner of the Organization in that \r\nnoble matter. Ukraine’s contribution to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security provides us with the \r\nmoral ground to count on the same assistance from the \r\nOrganization in times of the vital importance of that \r\nissue on the part of my country.\r\nThe special peacekeeping mission in Dombas, under \r\nUnited Nations auspices, could become a very useful \r\ninstrument contributing to the implementation of the \r\nMinsk agreements. Ukraine is committed to following \r\nthe letter and spirit of the Minsk package. We demand \r\nthe same approach from other signatories that have \r\nlately resorted to the language of blackmail. Otherwise, \r\nthere is no alternative to sanctions, including their \r\nstrengthening; and there is no alternative to a peaceful \r\nresolution of the crisis.\r\nFull access to all occupied territories by the \r\nmonitors of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE), withdrawal of Russian \r\nmilitary forces, military equipment and mercenaries \r\nfrom Ukrainian territory and restoration of full control \r\nby Ukraine over its border with Russia— these must all \r\nbe ensured. Freedom, peace and respect for sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity — Ukraine does not demand \r\nmore; however, it will not settle for less.\r\nUnfortunately, today Ukraine is, though not by its \r\nown free will, one of the areas involved in the fight against \r\nthe terrorist threat. We strongly condemn terrorism in \r\nall its forms and manifestations. The activities of the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant, Al-Qaida, Boko \r\nHaram, Al-Shabaab and others comprise a global \r\nchallenge. The only possible way to address that evil is \r\nto unite in a common, uncompromising fight against it. \r\nInternational terrorism has proved to be more \r\nf lexible than the political will of nations and today has \r\ntaken on new hybrid forms. State and non-State actors \r\nhave become interlinked. The struggle for one’s rights \r\nhas been replaced by ruthless terror. We are convinced \r\nthat the need for a universal international instrument \r\nable to counteract that crime is not only urgent but \r\nlong overdue. For that reason, the conclusion of the \r\npreparatory work on the draft United Nations convention \r\non the prevention and combating of terrorism should \r\nbecome a top priority of the General Assembly at this \r\nsession.\r\nA special role in the fight against international \r\nterrorism should be given to the most reputable legal \r\ninstitutions: the International Court of Justice and \r\nthe International Criminal Court. Ensuring that those \r\ninstitutions have universal jurisdiction is a core element \r\nin overcoming the impunity of the terrorists themselves \r\nand their patrons — those regimes whose national \r\npolicy has become the mass production of terror.\r\nI strongly believe that one of the most important \r\naspects of fighting terrorism lies in honouring and \r\nsharing the memories of the victims. In that context, \r\nI propose that, at the current session, the General \r\nAssembly consider designating an international day to \r\ncommemorate the memory of the victims of terrorist \r\nacts. It is my feeling that humiliation, disregard of \r\npeople’s will and violation of their fundamental rights \r\nprompted Ukrainians to leave their homes in order \r\nto protest in 2013, which led to the beginning of our \r\nrevolution to uphold our dignity.\r\nUkraine has paid and continues to pay an extremely \r\nhigh price for its freedom and the right to live in a free \r\ncountry — the price of human lives. That is why the \r\n15-29431 29/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\ninterests of every single individual and the protection of \r\npeople’s rights are at the core of my large-scale reform \r\nprogramme, which was launched one year ago. For the \r\nfirst time in its 24 years of independence, Ukraine has \r\nadopted a national human rights strategy. It took into \r\naccount the best international practices from the human \r\nrights perspective, including the European Union’s \r\nStrategic Framework on Human Rights and Democracy.\r\nRussian aggression exposed the problem of \r\nensuring human rights in the Crimea and parts of the \r\nDonetsk and Luhansk regions. Leading international \r\nhuman rights organizations warned about the radical \r\ndeterioration of the human rights situation, which \r\napplies directly to Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars in \r\nthe occupied Crimea. I am referring specifically to the \r\npractice of imposing Russian citizenship in occupied \r\nCrimea by the Crimean occupation authorities, as well \r\nas the systematic persecution, arrest, abduction and \r\nkilling of pro-Ukraine residents of the peninsula and \r\nthe complete elimination of the independent media. \r\nUkraine reaffirms its commitment to the United Nations \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. By \r\nall legal means, we will continue to defend the rights \r\nof the Crimean Tatars — the indigenous people of \r\nUkraine — and the Ukrainians, who are suffering from \r\nthe repressive policies of the occupation authorities \r\nin the Crimea. I believe that the problem of blatant \r\nviolation of human rights in Crimea deserves particular \r\nconsideration in the General Assembly. And I hope that \r\nthe decision to address this issue will be taken during \r\nthe current session.\r\nI also feel obliged to mention the names of Nadiya \r\nSavchenko, Oleg Sentsov, Alexandr Kolchenko, among \r\nmany other Ukrainians, who are political prisoners \r\nof the Kremlin or have been illegally detained and \r\nsentenced. For example, Oleg Sentsov, a respected \r\nfilmmaker, was sentenced to 23 years in prison solely \r\nfor being a Ukrainian patriot. I call upon the United \r\nNations and its Member States to launch a worldwide \r\ncampaign to put pressure on the Russian authorities to \r\nimmediately release all the Ukrainian citizens that they \r\nare holding hostage. We will be able to achieve our goal \r\nonly if our action is global. Most of all, Ukraine needs \r\nsolidarity and assistance, which are truly powerful \r\ninstruments against aggression and injustice. Ukraine \r\nwill win for sure because truth is on our side. But \r\nwe will do so much faster if we have the support and \r\nsolidarity of the whole international community. \r\nThe ongoing hybrid war of Russia against \r\nUkraine has demonstrated that the international \r\ncommunity is facing another challenge, which \r\nrequires the consolidation of our efforts. The full-\r\nscale information war and propaganda campaign have \r\nbecome a particularly corrosive form of non-military \r\naggression. Fake news, blatant lies spread to justify \r\naggression, propaganda of intolerance and violence are \r\nphenomena of the same order, which undermine the \r\nprinciple of freedom of expression and poison human \r\nsouls and minds. That is why the task of strengthening \r\nthe role of information in the maintenance of peace \r\nand security is more important than ever. I call on the \r\nGeneral Assembly to strongly condemn these shameful \r\nphenomena and to discuss the ways to confront them.\r\nDespite the external challenges that I have referred \r\nto, Ukraine is fully committed to the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals. We are ready \r\nto share joint responsibility for solving specific vital \r\nproblems and priorities of the most vulnerable groups \r\nof countries, such as the small island developing States. \r\nAs one of the Friends on Climate Change, Ukraine is \r\nlooking forward to reaching consensus on a universal \r\nagreement in the area of climate change as soon as \r\npossible. We hope that this result will be achieved \r\nby Member States in December in Paris. We have to \r\nunderstand that the price of this issue is the safety of \r\nfuture generations and the sustainable development of \r\nhumankind.\r\nWe shall not be able to achieve the sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals unless we are able to prevent \r\nenvironmental and technological disasters from \r\nhappening. As a result of the Russian aggression, \r\nUkraine faces another challenge — the protection of \r\nits environment in Donbas. The irresponsible and \r\ncriminal f looding of mines by terrorists has led to the \r\npoisoning of drinking water, the soil, and the f lora and \r\nfauna in the region. The atmosphere is polluted owing \r\nto explosions and the shelling of sensitive industrial \r\ninfrastructure. In fact, we can even speak about the risk \r\nof environmental disaster. I am convinced that the issue \r\nof environmental protection during conflict needs the \r\nspecial attention of the relevant United Nations body. \r\nWith regard to technological disasters, it is my duty \r\nto recall one of the most horrific of them. Next year \r\nwill mark the thirtieth anniversary of the tragedy of the \r\nChernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. I would like to request \r\nthat the President hold a special meeting of the General \r\nAssembly dedicated to that anniversary in April 2016.\r\n30/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nMy country’s address on the occasion of joining the \r\nUnited Nations included the words,\r\n“Ukraine, with its best human strength and material \r\nresources, will be able to make a significant \r\ncontribution to maintaining peace and global \r\nsecurity”. \r\nNow, 70 years on, I reiterate Ukraine’s unwavering \r\ncommitment to exerting a further maximum effort to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war, \r\na commitment enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Our focus will be on the achievement of \r\nthat noble goal if we are elected to a non-permanent \r\nmembership of the Security Council during 2016-2017.\r\nIn the capacity of member of the Council, Ukraine \r\nintends to remain a reliable and consistent partner, \r\nguided not by its own, but by the global agenda, and will \r\nresolutely follow the spirit and letter of the Charter. And \r\nI am firmly convinced that the Organization will pass \r\nthe extremely complex test with dignity and strengthen \r\nits role as a guarantor of order, peace and prosperity in \r\nthe world. Let God be with us!\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Ukraine for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): The Assembly \r\nwill now hear an address by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to thank our Ambassador Maria Emma Mejía \r\nVélez for giving me the f loor. What a source of great \r\npride it is for us that a Colombian woman is presiding \r\nover this meeting at this historic moment, when the \r\nGeneral Assembly is considering the topic “The United \r\nNations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and \r\nhuman rights”, which is the road along which Colombia \r\nis travelling, now more successfully than ever before. \r\nI am therefore honoured to come to this Assembly \r\nto share some news which is also historic. Today, I \r\nproclaim to the entire world that one of the more than \r\n20 armed conflicts taking place across the globe, which \r\nare causing so much pain, poverty and suffering, that \r\nof my country, Colombia, is finally nearing a genuine \r\nsolution. We will put an end to the longest and most \r\nrecent armed conflict in the Western Hemisphere. \r\nAchieving peace — in Colombia or in any part of the \r\nworld — is a responsibility that nobody must shirk.\r\nAs Pope Francis said so well a few days ago in the \r\nCongress of the United States of America,\r\n“When countries which have been at odds \r\nresume the path of dialogue — a dialogue which \r\nmay have been interrupted for the most legitimate \r\nof reasons — new opportunities open up for all. \r\nThis has required, and requires, courage and \r\ndaring, which is not the same as irresponsibility.”\r\nIn Colombia we have tried to work with the courage, \r\nthe audacity and also the sense of responsibility of \r\nwhich the Holy Father spoke, and we are beginning to \r\nsee the fruits of our efforts. We have had more than \r\n50 years of internal warfare in a country destined for \r\nprogress and happiness, and we are determined to \r\nput an end to that conflict. Peace is a difficult goal to \r\nattain, but not an impossible one. Peace is something \r\nmore than the fruit of a political, social or economic \r\nprocess. Peace, more than anything, is a great process \r\nof collective cultural transformation that begins with \r\nan individual spiritual change, and it requires that all \r\nindividuals — each within himself or herself— open \r\ntheir minds, hearts and souls to reconciliation.\r\nWhy do I say that today I come to this Assembly \r\nwith greater optimism than ever before? Well, it is \r\nbecause less than a week ago in Havana, after almost \r\nthree years of negotiations in which we made progress \r\non most of the items on the agreed agenda, we reached \r\nan agreement on what was perhaps the major obstacle to \r\npeace. We reached an agreement on the most difficult \r\nelement of any peace process — a system of transitional \r\njustice that ensures that there is no impunity for the \r\nmost serious crimes committed during the conflict. In \r\nthis agreement, which respects the norms and principles \r\nof international law and our own Constitution, we put \r\nthe greatest emphasis on the right of victims to justice \r\n15-29431 31/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nand on truth, reparations and the non-resumption of \r\nthe conflict, placing them at the centre of the solution \r\nto an armed conflict. And we are reaching our goal: \r\nthe maximum degree of justice compatible with the \r\nattainment of peace.\r\nIt is also the first time in the history of conflicts \r\nin the world that a Government and an illegal armed \r\ngroup — in a peace agreement, not as the result of \r\nsomething that was imposed later on — are creating \r\na system of accountability in a domestic court for \r\ninternational crimes and other serious crimes. We are \r\nsetting a precedent that could serve as a model for other \r\narmed conflicts in the world. The progress made is so \r\nimportant and significant that it has enabled us to take \r\ntwo additional steps, which is the best news that I could \r\nconvey to this great forum of nations. We have agreed \r\nto a deadline for signing the final agreement that \r\nwould put an end to our armed conflict. It will be, at \r\nthe very latest, 23 March 2016, in less than six months \r\nfrom now. On that date at the very latest, we shall bid \r\na final farewell to the last and longest war not just in \r\nColombia, but in the entire Western Hemisphere. In \r\naddition, we have also agreed that the Fuerzas Armadas \r\nRevolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) will begin to \r\nlay down its weapons no later than 60 days following \r\nthe signing of the final agreement. That means that \r\nnext year, when I return to this Assembly, I will do \r\nso as President of a Colombia that is at peace and has \r\nachieved reconciliation.\r\nOur talks with the FARC guerilla forces offer \r\na glimmer of hope in a world overshadowed by war, \r\nviolence and terrorism. This is also an opportunity \r\nto thank the international community, on behalf of \r\n48 million Colombians, for its support for our peace \r\nefforts and for its willingness to assist us in the post-\r\nconflict stage. A peaceful Colombia will be a positive \r\nfactor for the world in several distinct but interrelated \r\nareas, such as combating climate change and illegal \r\ndrugs, security and eradicating extreme poverty.\r\nOur country is proud to be the most biodiverse \r\ncountry in the world in relation to its size. However, we \r\nare also one of the most vulnerable to the effects of climate \r\nchange. That is why we insist on the environmental \r\ndimension of the Sustainable Development Goals. At \r\nthe end of my term in office in 2018, I hope to have left \r\nbehind protected areas in Colombia of approximately \r\n20 million hectares, accounting for almost one-fifth of \r\nour landmass. We fully support the twenty-first session \r\nof the Conference of Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, which is to \r\nbe held at the end of this year in Paris, where we will \r\ncommit to assisting in the goal of reducing greenhouse \r\ngas emissions.\r\nWe are also addressing the problem of illegal drug \r\ncrops with a comprehensive strategy that we have \r\nproposed to the rest of the world. At the Summit of \r\nthe Americas, held in Cartagena, Colombia, in 2012, \r\nI raised the need for an objective assessment of the \r\noutcome of the so-called war on drugs declared here \r\nmore than 40 years ago, which has been so costly in \r\nhuman lives and resources. The study was conducted \r\nand submitted by the Organization of American States \r\ntwo years ago. Now, we are preparing for the special \r\nsession of the General Assembly on this issue,to take \r\nplace seven months from now. We continue to advocate \r\na new global strategy based on scientific evidence that \r\nputs greater emphasis on health, education and tackling \r\nthe social roots of this phenomenon and seeks to \r\nminimize the negative effects of drugs through the use \r\nof smarter, more effective and more humane strategies.\r\nIn Colombia, we have gone even further. Last week, \r\nI presented a comprehensive crop-substitution plan \r\nbased on that multifaceted approach. Not only will we \r\nattack the mafias, whom we will pursue relentlessly, but \r\nwe will also provide social and economic opportunities \r\nfor farmers, ensure that the State and the justice system \r\nare ever-present, prevent drug use and treat it as a public \r\nhealth issue. If we end the conflict, the guerrilla forces \r\nthat have been a negative factor in drug-trafficking will \r\nbecome, once they lay down their weapons, an ally in \r\ncombating it. It will be extraordinarily symbolic when \r\nthose who once protected these illicit crops will help \r\nus to eradicate them. In that way, Colombia wins and \r\nthe entire world wins. We will begin to free ourselves \r\nfrom coca and, at the same time, to preserve and save \r\nmillions of hectares of tropical forest. As the Pope so \r\neloquently said in this very Hall four days ago, “war is \r\nthe negation of all rights and a dramatic assault on the \r\nenvironment” (A/70/PV.3, p. 5).\r\nA peaceful Colombia will also be a safer Colombia \r\nbecause the enormous energy and effort that today are \r\ndedicated to dealing with this domestic conflict will be \r\nfocused on improving security and on fighting crime in \r\nthe cities and villages of my country. Of course, it will \r\nbe a Colombia with more opportunities for everyone \r\nwhere we will continue to reduce poverty and create \r\njobs, as we have been doing at a rate that has made us \r\nthe leader in Latin America in terms of social progress, \r\n32/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nin recent years. Achieving peace will enable us to meet \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, which are now \r\nenshrined in Colombian law and which we adopted in \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\nI now invite all Colombians, without exception, and \r\nall citizens of the world to pave the way for peace. The \r\nmost worthwhile legacy we could leave to our children \r\nand to future generations is peace. Nothing could be \r\nmore important or more urgent because peace is the \r\nsupreme good of any society. It is the most sacred \r\ngood and the very reason for the existence of the \r\nUnited Nations. Today, I am delighted to announce the \r\ngood news that, in fewer than six months, bells will \r\ntoll in Colombia to announce that the time for peace \r\nhas come. I hope that clocks around the world will be \r\nsynchronized with our own to show the same time — a \r\ntime for peace, a time for humankind.\r\nThe Vice-President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Colombia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Anastasiades: This year marks the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the creation of the United \r\nNations, and provides us with an opportunity to take \r\nstock of the past seven decades, as well as to jointly \r\ndiscuss and exchange ideas on how to further improve \r\nthe Organization’s effectiveness and its members’ \r\ncollaboration, with the benefit of humankind always \r\nin view. In order to assess our collective efforts, we \r\nshould first recall the guiding principles that led to the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations in the aftermath of \r\nthe death and destruction of the Second World War. The \r\nPreamble to the founding Charter of the United Nations \r\nestablishes the eradication of the scourge of war and \r\nthe promotion of human rights as the cornerstones of \r\nour edifice.\r\nSo far, the United Nations has succeeded in \r\npreventing another world war and has helped to end \r\nconflicts through mediation. Currently, more than \r\n100,000 United Nations peacekeepers are deployed in \r\n16 countries. Yet numerous armed conflicts all over the \r\nplanet attest to the fact that global peace still evades \r\nus. In the area of human rights, the United Nations \r\nhas undertaken inspiring initiatives, starting with \r\nthe adoption in 1948 of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and followed by many international \r\nagreements and treaties setting universal standards \r\nfor civil, political, social and economic rights. Yet in \r\na world challenged by poverty, hunger, child mortality \r\nand social and economic inequalities, it is evident that \r\nwe have a long way to go.\r\nAt the same time, leaving aside the strengths \r\nand weaknesses, successes and failures of the United \r\nNations, we should not undermine or underestimate \r\nthe fact that in an interdependent world it provides the \r\nonly international forum in which nations can interact, \r\ndeliberate and negotiate so as to resolve not only their \r\ndifferences, but also pressing regional and international \r\nchallenges that are not country-specific and that call \r\nthe international order into question.\r\nIn order to enhance its value and influence in a \r\nglobalized era, the United Nations has evolved, with \r\nits recent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). The 2030 Agenda seeks \r\nto address the needs of a developing global population \r\nthrough its commonly agreed 17 Goals and 169 \r\ntargets. Cyprus, which has been actively involved in \r\nthe process since its very beginning, is proud of this \r\nachievement, since it ref lects our high principles of \r\neffective multilateralism and close cooperation among \r\nthe nations of the world.\r\nHowever, while on the one hand we have achieved \r\nthe adoption of such an ambitious agenda, on the \r\nother we are also witnessing the ongoing turmoil, \r\nextremism, sectarianism, civil war and terrorism that \r\nare taking place in the Middle East, North Africa and \r\nother regions. Their effects — death, persecution, \r\n15-29431 33/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\ndispossession of property, displacement, destruction of \r\ncultural heritage and forced migration — are becoming \r\ndefining features of the daily lives of those affected. We \r\nmust therefore be vigilant, for while we are attempting \r\nto establish fundamental principles of peace, stability \r\nand sustainable development for the future, in practice \r\nwe are seeing the increasing migratory f lows of those \r\nwho are involuntarily f leeing their homes in search of \r\na better future. As we strive to set up noble, long-term \r\nobjectives and goals, events that are currently unfolding \r\nmay render them irrelevant or unattainable. When we \r\nassume that only Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and, more \r\nrecently, Europe are affected by the current refugee \r\ncrisis, we fail to acknowledge that if it persists, other \r\ncountries and continents will be affected as well.\r\nIn order to reverse those worrying developments, \r\ntherefore, we should direct our efforts so that every \r\ncountry and region in a conflict zone, particularly the \r\nMiddle East and North Africa, can become a place in \r\nwhich sustainable development is a reality. That can \r\nbe achieved only by tackling the root causes that have \r\nled to this unprecedented situation — that is, political \r\ninstability and economic insecurity. We should address \r\nthis collectively and comprehensively. It is not enough \r\nto take action against the individuals responsible for \r\nterrorist attacks; we should focus our efforts on the \r\nenablers of terrorism. It is not enough to rescue people \r\nfrom sinking boats; we should focus our efforts on \r\nhuman traffickers. It is not enough to support economic \r\nimmigrants financially; we should focus our efforts on \r\ncreating the political and socioeconomic conditions \r\nthat can ensure that all these people do not emigrate \r\nfrom their countries.\r\nIn view of this horrific humanitarian crisis, \r\none might wonder if we have neglected to take the \r\nnecessary measures to avert this crisis. Has our \r\nstrategy been adequate? Have we failed to predict \r\nthe events that have unfolded? Considering Cyprus’s \r\nproximity to the Middle East and North Africa, as well \r\nas our historical, political, social and cultural links, I \r\nam firmly convinced that the international community \r\nhas failed to sufficiently appreciate those regions’ \r\ncomplexities. At the same time, foreign interventions \r\nand involvement have not produced the hoped-for \r\nresults, because they have failed to take into account \r\nand understand those nations’ internal characteristics \r\nand particular sensitivities.\r\nI would like to quote a remark made by the \r\nSecretary-General at a ceremony in San Francisco on \r\n26 June commemorating the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Charter.\r\n“Today, we take the idea of the United Nations \r\nfor granted, but bringing it to life required huge \r\nleaps of statecraft to bridge differences.”\r\nAnd while we recognize how valuable and necessary \r\nthe United Nations is today, we can also see that it is in \r\nneed of reform and modernization to enable it to tackle \r\ntoday’s realities.\r\nThe international order and perspectives of 1945 \r\nare not the same as those of 2015. Traditional security \r\norientations have changed due to new geopolitical \r\ncircumstances. Issues of peace and stability can no \r\nlonger be confined to the differences between and \r\nwithin nations, when non-State actors such as terrorists \r\nhave challenged the established international order, \r\npaving the way for religious fundamentalism, violent \r\nextremism, the forcible displacement of people and \r\nforced migration.\r\nAt the same time, new global threats such as climate \r\nchange and environmental degradation have also \r\nemerged, After 70 years, world leaders must once again \r\ndemonstrate statesmanship and vision in order to rebuild \r\nnewly broken societies and find a path to renewal. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the recently adopted resolution \r\n69/321, on revitalization, as well as the ongoing dialogue \r\ntowards enhancing the effectiveness of the Security \r\nCouncil. We also support the upcoming high-level \r\nUnited Nations meetings aimed at resolving a number \r\nof global challenges, including the United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference, in Paris in December; \r\nthe special session on the world drug problem, in April \r\n2016; and the United Nations Conference on Housing \r\nand Sustainable Urban Development, in Quito in \r\nNovember 2016.\r\nPeacekeeping constitutes one of the main pillars \r\nand accomplishments of the United Nations. However, \r\nthe United Nations is not only about peacekeeping; it \r\nis also about conflict prevention and peacebuilding. \r\nArticle 33 of the Charter of the United Nations provides \r\na wide gamut of options for the peaceful settlement \r\nof issues. We look forward to concrete proposals for \r\nadapting United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nto the changing nature of conflict and for enhancing \r\ntheir effectiveness and their ability to promote political \r\nsolutions. In that regard, we greatly welcome the 2015 \r\nreview of United Nations peacebuilding operations (see \r\n34/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nA/70/95), and we compliment the Secretary-General \r\nfor undertaking that initiative.\r\nCyprus, through its own experience of hosting a \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping force, greatly values the \r\ncontribution of the United Nations to the maintenance \r\nof peace and security. We also express our appreciation \r\nfor the plethora of United Nations resolutions and \r\nSecurity Council decisions that have condemned the \r\nunacceptable status quo and the violent and ongoing \r\ndivision of the island, calling for its reunification and \r\nthe withdrawal of occupation forces — resolutions \r\nand decisions that, unfortunately, have yet to be \r\nimplemented.\r\nFollowing the non-renewal of actions that \r\nviolated the exercise by the Republic of Cyprus of its \r\nsovereign rights within its exclusive economic zone \r\nand the change in the leadership of the Turkish Cypriot \r\ncommunity, a window of opportunity opened, reviving \r\nour hope that the round of negotiations that resumed \r\nin May will lead to a final settlement of the Cyprus \r\nproblem. That hope is based on my conviction that both \r\nI and the Turkish Cypriot leader share the same courage \r\nand resolve to advance decisively towards making the \r\njoint vision of our peoples — who desire the solution \r\nof the Cyprus problem through a viable, lasting and \r\nfunctional settlement — a reality. That settlement must \r\nbe in full conformity with the values and principles of \r\nthe character of the United Nations and the European \r\nUnion acquis, as well as with the high-level agreements \r\nbetween the leaders of the two communities and the \r\njoint declaration of 11 February 2014. Such a settlement \r\nwould lead to the evolution of the Republic of Cyprus \r\nas a federal State in a bizonal, bicommunal federation \r\nwith political equality, single sovereignty, a single \r\ninternational legal personality and a single form of \r\ncitizenship; a State that is and will continue to be a \r\nMember of the United Nations, the European Union and \r\nnumerous other international organizations, and whose \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and constitutional \r\norder will not be constrained by anachronistic systems \r\nof guarantees by third countries or the presence of \r\nforeign troops on the island.\r\nWhat we aspire to achieve through this new \r\nround of negotiations is to reach a settlement in which \r\nthere will be neither winners nor losers; that takes \r\ninto account the sensitivities and concerns of both \r\ncommunities; that respects the fundamental freedoms \r\nand human rights of all Cypriots, Greek and Turkish \r\nalike; that reunites our country, its people, its economy \r\nand its institutions; that creates a homeland of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and prosperous collaboration among all its \r\ncitizens, to the benefit of the younger generations; that \r\nallows Cyprus to realize its full potential by removing \r\nall political barriers that prevent the full exploitation \r\nof its unique geographical position at the crossroads \r\nof Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia; \r\nthat transforms Cyprus into a shining example of \r\nethnic, cultural, religious and linguistic cooperation \r\nbetween Christian and Muslim communities; and that \r\nturns Cyprus into a model of reliability, stability and \r\nsecurity in a turbulent and volatile region currently \r\ncharacterized by protracted conflicts and instability.\r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that, during \r\nthe new round of negotiations, progress has been \r\nachieved on a number of issues that touch on almost \r\nall chapters of the Cyprus problem. However, on other \r\nsubstantive issues, significant differences still need \r\nto be resolved — differences whose resolution will \r\nalso require the active and determined contribution of \r\nTurkey, whose occupation forces remain in the northern \r\npart of our country. 1 sincerely hope that Turkey’s \r\nrhetorical assurances of its desire to reach a settlement \r\nwill at last be tested in practice through the adoption \r\nof concrete measures that will positively underpin the \r\nnegotiation process and reflect the current climate of \r\nhope on the island.\r\nI strongly believe that reaching a solution to the \r\nCyprus problem could become a paradigm for the way \r\nin which diplomacy and the adoption of a conciliatory \r\nstance can prevail over mistrust and contribute to \r\nthe resolution of even the most difficult international \r\nissues. Furthermore, the discovery of hydrocarbon \r\nreserves in the Eastern Mediterranean has the potential \r\nto create synergies and a grid of alliances for broader \r\ncooperation between hydrocarbon-producing and \r\nhydrocarbon-consuming countries of the area and \r\nbeyond, to the benefit of the socioeconomic development \r\nand welfare of our peoples. Such positive developments \r\ncan foster the achievement and maintenance of a much-\r\nneeded environment of stability and peace in our \r\nimmediate neighbourhood.\r\nI am certain that the General Assembly shares the \r\nview that the settlement of the Cyprus problem will \r\ncreate a win-win situation, not only for its people, \r\nbut also for the region, the interested parties and the \r\ninternational community at large.\r\n15-29431 35/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Republic of Cyprus for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the \r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Eastern Republic of \r\nUruguay.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern Republic \r\nof Uruguay, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vázquez (spoke in Spanish): I bring to \r\nthis forum, the largest and most representative of today’s \r\nworld, the greetings of the people and the Government \r\nof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay — a greeting \r\nthat expresses our passion for peace and freedom; \r\nour commitment to democracy, human rights, justice \r\nand solidarity; our commitment to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of our country; and our desire for a \r\nhumankind that, despite the redundancy, places at \r\nits core human beings — all human beings, men and \r\nwomen of this world without exception or excuse. We \r\nare all equal before the law, but above all we are all \r\nequal before life.\r\nAlthough I come from Uruguay, I am not here to \r\ntalk about the problems of Uruguay. I would modestly \r\nlike to discuss problems affecting humankind as a \r\nwhole. Weeks ago the world public opinion was moved \r\nby the image of a dead child on a beach after the sinking \r\nof the vessel with which, like so many other victims of \r\nthe conflict in their country, he was trying to find a \r\nplace in the world where he could find the protection \r\nto which he was entitled. The international reaction \r\nwas immediate, but we hope that it was not ephemeral, \r\nthat we not forget this tragedy that hit us and shamed \r\nus, to act with determination and efficiency in finding \r\nsolutions to the global tragedy of the exodus of millions \r\nof human beings.\r\nUruguay, as a nation nurtured by immigration and \r\nas a people that received international solidarity when it \r\nneeded it, accepts this unavoidable duty. It is imperative \r\nto avoid a repetition of this tragedy, but it is also \r\nnecessary to address the causes that brought it about. \r\nAlways, and not just in matters of health, prevention is \r\nbetter than cure. Prevention means recognizing others \r\nas the same as us, which is much more than “tolerating” \r\nthem”, respecting and promoting their rights, all their \r\nrights; betting on democracy as a form of government \r\nand state of society; educating and training for dignified \r\nlife, decent work and full citizenship; respecting the \r\nplanet on which we live, which, moreover, is still the \r\nonly one on which the human species can survive as \r\nsuch. If we continue to destroy this world in the short \r\nterm, humankind and future generations are sure to be \r\nhomeless.\r\nPrevention also means rejecting all forms of \r\nterrorism and discrimination so that there are no \r\ndead children on the beaches of the world because \r\nthey cannot find a place to live, rejecting terrorism \r\nand discrimination wherever they arise and in all \r\ncircumstances and places. Prevention is thinking boldly \r\nand acting sensibly with an eye on future generations, \r\nbut as there is no future without a present, prevention is \r\nalso thinking and acting according to our hopes, needs \r\nand possibilities.\r\nA moment ago, I made a reference to health, no \r\ndoubt because of my work experience — since I am \r\na physician and until very recently was in the full \r\nexercise of my profession and vocation — but not \r\nonly from experience. As the leader of my country, I \r\nam well aware that public health is a key and essential \r\ncomponent of the sovereignty of nations, a right of \r\nindividuals, a factor in the development of societies and \r\nan unavoidable responsibility of States.\r\nFrom that perspective, we face a disturbing and \r\nunavoidable reality at the level of the whole of planet \r\nEarth. Indeed, according to recent studies and reports of \r\nthe World Health Organization, first, the global burden \r\nof disease is shifting from acute, infectious diseases \r\nto chronic non-communicable diseases; the two must \r\nbe fought, by working to keep acute diseases from \r\nappearing and by acting to prevent non-communicable \r\nchronic diseases from occurring. Secondly, chronic \r\nconditions such as heart disease and strokes are \r\n36/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\ncurrently the leading cause of death worldwide. If we \r\nadd other non-communicable diseases linked mainly to \r\nthe lifestyle that we are developing as we advance, it is \r\nobvious that there is little left to say. Over 60 to 70 per \r\ncent of morbidity and mortality worldwide is due to \r\nchronic non-communicable diseases — cardiovascular \r\ndiseases, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary \r\ndisease, diabetes, and so on. Accordingly there is still \r\nso much to be done.\r\nThat task should have no borders of any kind, \r\nbecause the complex of problems underlying them \r\nknow no borders. That is so much the case that the \r\nmere mention of the complex global landscape brings \r\nto mind Africa and Asia in particular, as well as Latin \r\nAmerica, where many low-income and middle-income \r\ncountries currently face a double burden of morbidity. \r\nInfectious diseases are killing people mercilessly and \r\nimpacting us deeply, while chronic non-communicable \r\ndiseases are also insidiously killing our populations.\r\nAt the same time, malnutrition and risk factors \r\nfor chronic non-communicable diseases, such as \r\noverweight and obesity, have been said to also affect \r\nhigh-income countries and remain prevalent in the \r\nworld. It is estimated that cancer has been costing \r\nLatin America $4.5 billion annually in terms of direct \r\ncosts for physicians’ consultations, studies, diagnoses, \r\ntreatment, medication, hospitalization, palliative care \r\nand more. There are indirect costs as well, such as travel \r\nand accommodations, lost work days and productivity. \r\nHow much of that money could be saved if, rather than \r\nusing it to treat the effects of these diseases, it could \r\nbe put into social policies to improve people’s lives by \r\noffering better education, better health and dignifed \r\nliving conditions for our peoples?\r\nIt may be unpleasant to mention this aspect, but it \r\nis part of an uncomfortable reality that we must change, \r\nbecause if we do not adopt immediate measures by the \r\nyear 2030, 1 million Latin Americans will die annually \r\nof cancer alone, and more than 7 million people \r\nglobally will die from a preventable disease that, with \r\nearly diagnosis and proper treatment, can be cured. \r\nCancer will kill more people in the world every year \r\nthan those killed during the Second World War. We are \r\nfacing a brutal pandemic and, I humbly suggest, we \r\nmust be aware of the reality we are currently suffering a \r\npandemic that the humankind has never before known.\r\nLife is precious; it has no price. In order to address \r\nand reverse the growing morbidity and mortality \r\nfrom cancer and other non-communicable diseases, it \r\nis important to adopt political positions and policies \r\nand to implement systemic strategies to end poverty, \r\ngenerate social inclusion, promote education, encourage \r\nhealthful lifestyles, and strengthen integrated health \r\nsystems, including national programmes for the \r\nprimary prevention, early detection and diagnosis, \r\ntreatment, rehabilitation and long-term follow-up of \r\nthese diseases. In regard to healthful lifestyles, physical \r\nactivity and sports are important, as is a healthful diet, \r\nas opposed to the harmful and highly processed foods \r\nof an industry that growing exponentially.\r\nWe must control smoking, alcoholism and drug \r\nabuse. Based on our experience, we feel that it is \r\nindispensable to include tobacco and alcohol in our \r\npolicies on drugs. We know it is not easy, but it is \r\npossible to regulate those markets without resorting to \r\nprohibitionist dogmatism and respecting the rights of \r\nindividuals and making public health a matter of State \r\nsovereignty and social progress. Above all, I reiterate \r\nthat the fight against smoking is also one against its \r\nvector of transmission, which is not mosquitoes, birds \r\nor rats but a multinational tobacco industry that, in \r\norder to double its profits, has no problem killing its \r\nown customers.\r\nUruguay has been a world leader in the \r\nimplementation of the Framework Convention on \r\nTobacco Control. Beginning in January 2014, Uruguay \r\nadopted a law on the control and regulation of \r\ncannabis, and we are working on measures related to \r\ncontrolling alcoholism, perhaps with a zero-tolerance \r\npolicy in certain cases and circumstances. Finally, \r\nwith regard to that issue, nothing can be achieved in \r\nisolation. Everything requires sensitivity, resolve \r\nand perseverance on the part of all Governments and \r\npeoples throughout the world.\r\nIn the area of international cooperation, we are not \r\nstarting from zero. There are a number of institutional \r\nframeworks and modalities and very many projects \r\nunder way. Could the implementation of the former and \r\nthe progress of the latter be improved? No doubt, but \r\nrather than inventing new ones, let us make better use \r\nof what we already have. To that end, we certainly will \r\nneed more human, material and financial resources, but \r\nthere is one resource without which all these things, as \r\nabundant as they may be, will always be insufficient. \r\nI am referring to the resource of political will, which \r\nin this case is more than an ideological dilemma or a \r\nquestion of left, right or centre; it is an ethical issue.\r\n15-29431 37/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nIt is not ethical that, in some circumstances, tribunals \r\nand multinational organizations are able to prioritize \r\ntrade over the defence of the fundamental human right \r\nto health and life. That is what Uruguay is suffering \r\nfrom. A major international tobacco company — I \r\nwould cite only its initials so as not to offend certain \r\nsensibilities, but it is in fact Philip Morris — has \r\nappealed against Uruguay for bringing the issue of \r\ntobacco control to the World Health Organization. That \r\nis the situation Uruguay faces. Perhaps because we are \r\na small country, we have been chosen for that role, not \r\njust to punish Uruguay but so that other countries of \r\nthe world do not follow the path Uruguay has taken to \r\nfight against tobacco and to provide a better quality of \r\nlife to its people.\r\nCalling for ethics in the twenty-first century, I \r\nrealize, might appear to be naïve or anachronistic, but \r\nthe reality indicates the opposite. As we stated, we need \r\nonly look at the news of the past few weeks to see that \r\nin some aspects, none of them trivial, the world really \r\nseems to be a kind of lunatic asylum run by its own \r\npatients. That is terrible, but if humankind wants to \r\nsurvive and progress, it cannot resign itself to such a \r\nterrible situation. It cannot become resigned to war or \r\nto the humiliation of poor people who have nothing to \r\neat, nor can we close our eyes 24 hours after seeing a \r\nSyrian boy dead on a Turkish beach.\r\nFrom our own perspective as a Latin American \r\ncountry and as Latin Americans, we cannot fail to \r\nmention three situations that are prominent on the \r\nagenda of our region. The first is the restoration of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba as an indispensable step in the normalization \r\nof bilateral relations between the two countries. We \r\ncommend that step, and while we are aware of the \r\ncomplexity of the process under way, we are confident \r\nwith regard to its future, particularly with regard to the \r\nkey element of ending the economic, trade and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba more than 50 years ago by \r\nthe Government of the United States. As it has done on \r\nprevious occasions, Uruguay will vote in favour of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s draft resolution calling for an end \r\nto the embargo. Hopefully it will be the last time that \r\nthe Assembly will have to pronounce on the issue.\r\nThe second situation in Latin America is the \r\ntension that has existed for several weeks on the border \r\nbetween Colombia and Venezuela. We call for calm, \r\nrespectful and open dialogue between the Governments \r\nof these brother countries in order to deal with this \r\nsituation, whose main victims are the peoples of the \r\ntwo countries, especially their socially most vulnerable \r\nsectors.\r\nThe third situation is the peace talks in Colombia, \r\nanother complex but decisive process for our brother \r\ncountry and our region as a whole. We support this \r\nprocess and are ready to cooperate with it under the \r\nterms agreed to and demanded by the parties. Uruguay \r\nis not omnipotent, nor does it claim to be omnipresent \r\nor infallible, but neither is it indifferent.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nIn 2008, our country officially submitted its \r\ncandidacy for a seat on the Security Council as a \r\nnon-permanent member for the period 2016 to 2017. We \r\ndid so based on our commitment to this Organization, \r\nof which we are a founding member; on our adherence \r\nto international law and multilateralism; on our firm \r\nrejection of all forms of terrorism and discrimination; \r\non our conviction that the only means capable of \r\nresolving conflicts are the peaceful ones laid down in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations; and on our confidence \r\nin the value of the Security Council’s efforts to fulfil \r\nits primary function of maintaining international peace \r\nand security.\r\nUruguay has contributed to peace and security \r\nwith a concrete and unwavering commitment that \r\nbegan before the creation of the United Nations, has \r\nbeen maintained over the Organization’s 70-year \r\nhistory and today is manifest in its participation in the \r\npeacekeeping operations whose mandates come from \r\nthat very Security Council. We want to bring our values, \r\ncommitment and efforts to bear as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Council for the period 2016 to 2017. We \r\nrely on the support of those here to help us do that, and \r\nwe will not disappoint them.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi, Minister for Defense and \r\n38/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Malawi Defense Force \r\nand the Malawi Police Service\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Thse \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi, Minister for Defense and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Malawi Defense Force and \r\nthe Malawi Police Service.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, Minister for Defense and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Malawi Defense Force \r\nand the Malawi Police Service, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Arthur \r\nPeter Mutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi, \r\nMinister for Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the \r\nMalawi Defense Force and the Malawi Police Service, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mutharika: It gives me great pleasure \r\nto congratulate Mr. Mogens Lukketoft on his election \r\nto preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. His credentials are impeccable, and I am \r\nconfident that he will steer the Assembly’s affairs to \r\na successful conclusion, with all his objectives and \r\naspirations fulfilled. I would like to assure him of my \r\ndelegation’s support. I would also like to thank His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of our sister country Uganda, \r\nthe outgoing President of the General Assembly, for his \r\nuntiring efforts during his presidency. His dedication to \r\nthe work of the United Nations is commendable. And I \r\nreiterate Malawi’s support for the Secretary-General as \r\nhe strives to realize the purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe theme of this year’s general debate, “The United \r\nNations at 70 — a new commitment to action”, comes \r\nat a very opportune time, for it fittingly summarizes \r\nthe core business of the United Nations at its inception, \r\ntoday and in the future — that is, the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The United Nations \r\nwas created on the understanding that peace is not \r\njust the absence of war; it comes with the struggles, \r\ncompromises, sacrifices and choices we make as \r\nnations and as individuals for the benefit of humanity. \r\nWe cannot realize a complete sense of peace without \r\njustice, dignity and freedom. We can rejoice that in the \r\n70 years of the work of the United Nations, we have \r\ncollectively averted another world war. However, during \r\nthe same period, we have lived in fear and uncertainty, \r\nin a world tainted by the conflicts, poverty and violence \r\nthat have endangered our very existence.\r\nAs we live in this imperfect world, the pursuit \r\nof peace should be our main goal if we are to shape \r\na promising life for our future generations. I would \r\ntherefore like to commend the Secretary-General for \r\nconvening the High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations, aimed at reviewing current United Nations \r\noperations and considering emerging future needs in \r\nthe prevention and resolution of conflicts. The Panel’s \r\nreport (A/70/95), submitted in June, has highlighted \r\nsome important issues that I feel that we, as part of \r\nthe global family, should consider and take seriously. \r\nI would like to mention just a few of those issues \r\ndemanding our attention as members of the United \r\nNations.\r\nFirst, peace operations should be guided by a focus \r\non political solutions, in which the emphasis should \r\nbe on conflict prevention through political means, \r\nwith a bias towards people-centred solutions as well \r\nas the protection of civilians. Secondly, there is a need \r\nfor comprehensive peace and security partnerships \r\nthat involve the Security Council, regional actors and \r\nnational mechanisms. Thirdly, the world, through \r\nthe United Nations, should find a way to compensate \r\npeople who have suffered abuse. Fourthly, there is a \r\nneed for greater political will on the part of all actors in \r\npeace missions.\r\nLet me now touch on another important issue that \r\nhas been on the agenda of the United Nations for quite \r\nsome time, that is, reform of the Security Council. I \r\nhave followed with keen interest the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on how the Security Council can be \r\nreformed to make it more representative, democratic, \r\neffective, transparent and accountable to all. The \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration are our \r\nguiding principles in that endeavour. Our quest for \r\npeace and security should be hinged on sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic development for our people that has \r\ntrue meaning and reflects the lives of our people.\r\nDespite varied progress among Member States, \r\nand developing countries in particular, the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) have proved that unity \r\nof purpose is critical to transforming the world into a \r\nbetter place for our children and future generations. \r\nMy Government is grateful to development partners \r\nthat have worked to help Malawi achieve four of the \r\n15-29431 39/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\neight MDGs: reducing child mortality, combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability and developing a global \r\npartnership for development. It is evident that as a \r\ncountry we are embarking on the implementation of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda with unfinished \r\nbusiness. It is therefore imperative, as we move to \r\nimplement the new global development agenda, to be \r\nmindful of the important role that global partnerships \r\ncan play in effective development cooperation, thereby \r\nensuring the successful implementation of development \r\nprogrammes in the developing countries.\r\nWe in Malawi are also glad to reiterate the fact \r\nthat, as we look to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, we can draw international pride and inspiration \r\nfrom our collective achievements on MDG 6, which \r\ninvolves halting and reversing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \r\nUnder that goal, we aimed to put 15 million people on \r\ntreatment globally, and today we can stand here and \r\nboldly declare that we have met that target. As we \r\nlook to the sustainable development agenda, we must \r\ncommit, as the international community, to putting an \r\nend to AIDS as a public health threat and finishing the \r\nbusiness of HIV/AIDS by 2030.\r\nMy Government has already committed to doing \r\nso, and current evidence shows that Malawi is well on \r\nthe way to achieving that goal. Together, we can end \r\nAIDS by 2030, but it will require conducting business \r\n“as unusual” and fast-tracking HIV responses, in line \r\nwith the evidence of what works. But more importantly, \r\nit will require continued shared responsibility and \r\nglobal solidarity in financing HIV programmes and \r\nenhancing the capacity of developing countries such as \r\nMalawi to manufacture the drugs and make them more \r\naccessible to our people.\r\nHaving said that, let me also reiterate what I have \r\nalways maintained — that all of the aforementioned \r\nwonderful programmes will be realized when \r\nwe, as a global family, do not leave our youth and \r\nwomen behind. In Malawi and, I believe, in almost \r\nall developing countries, young people and women \r\nconstitute the majority of the population. It is therefore \r\nonly natural that they be adequately represented at all \r\ndecision-making levels of society. The late President \r\nMandela of South Africa once said, “As long as a nation \r\nrefuses to acknowledge the equal role of more than half \r\nof itself, it is doomed to failure”. That is a fact and I \r\ncould not agree with it more.\r\nLet me commend President Xi Jinping of China, \r\nand the Secretary-General, through the Office of \r\nUN-Women, for organizing on the margins of this \r\nsession the Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender \r\nEquality and Women’s Empowerment: A Commitment \r\nto Action, under the theme “Planet 50-50 by 2030: step \r\nit up for gender equality”, to which a number of leaders, \r\nincluding Malawi’s, made national commitments.\r\nMy Government is committed to the “He For She” \r\ncampaign to address gender inequality, end gender-\r\nbased violence, promote women’s political participation \r\nand facilitate women’s economic empowerment. It has \r\ntherefore been singled out as one of the core priority \r\nareas of our revised Malawi Growth and Development \r\nStrategy — the blueprint of Malawi’s development. \r\nMalawi also took advantage of the forum to host a side \r\nhigh-level event to share perspectives on demographic \r\ndividends and investing in youth, which we hope \r\nwill successfully lead to improved coordination, \r\ncommitment and support for youth empowerment and \r\ndevelopment for Africa.\r\nWe have expressed the desire for shared prosperity \r\nand well-being and unity and integration, for a continent \r\nwhere the full potential of women and youth are realized \r\nwith freedom from fear, disease and want. As others \r\ntaking the f loor earlier have noted, two days ago we \r\nadopted the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \r\nThat was brilliant. However, allow me to highlight SDG \r\n4, which speaks of education. As a champion of higher \r\neducation in Africa, I wish to reiterate in no uncertain \r\nterms that all of the brilliant resolutions and decisions \r\ncoming out of this great forum, and many similar ones \r\nacross the world, will fall f lat if countries ignore the \r\ntask of educating the people, especially young people \r\nand, even more so, girl children.\r\nIn that vein, I am pleased to note that Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 4 is about “ensuring inclusive and \r\nequitable quality education and promoting lifelong \r\nlearning”. However, it does not fully capture the \r\ncentrality of higher education in achieving the wider \r\nSustainable Development Goals and targets. Allow me \r\nto express gratitude to those partners that continue to \r\nstand with us to promote higher education in Africa. \r\nWith improved and increased access to higher education, \r\nthe world will strike a massive blow at poverty.\r\nIn fulfilling its national and international \r\nresponsibility, my Government recognizes the cross-\r\ncutting role of respecting and protecting people’s \r\n40/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. My Government \r\nwill continue to promote human rights, inter alia, by \r\nenhancing awareness of human rights, promoting \r\nequitable access to opportunity and strengthening legal \r\nprotections.\r\nThe full enjoyment of people’s human rights cannot \r\nbe achieved in a society full of fraud, corruption and \r\ntheft of public resources. Those vices must be dealt with \r\nin order to protect people’s human rights and ensure the \r\ndelivery of expected services from their Government. \r\nOur Government has therefore always been committed \r\nto fighting corruption, fraud and theft. It is against \r\nthat background that we are pursuing and prosecuting \r\nsuspects for the theft of public funds. May god bless the \r\nUnited Nations family.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I thank \r\nthe President of the Republic of Malawi, Minister \r\nfor Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Malawi \r\nDefense Force and the Malawi Police Service for his \r\nstatement.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharkika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, Minister for Defense and \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Malawi Defense Force \r\nand the Malawi Police Service, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Donald Tusk, President of the \r\nEuropean Council\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe European Council.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil , was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Donald \r\nTusk, President of the European Council, and inviting \r\nhim to make a statement.\r\nMr. Tusk (European Council): I am here today \r\nto reassure the General Assembly that Europe is as \r\ncommitted to its values and objectives now as it has \r\never been. Europe will stay the course, even though it is \r\nnow confronting challenges that we have not witnessed \r\nfor decades. Wars are raging both to the south and \r\neast of our borders. European leaders are tackling the \r\nconsequences of borders being changed on our continent \r\nby force — as is the case in Ukraine — in violation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We are also dealing \r\nwith the refugee crisis, with terrorist attacks inside \r\nEurope and with economic difficulties in some member \r\nStates.\r\nAs difficult as the situation is, I am sure that we \r\nwill find ways of dealing with it and, most importantly, \r\nwe will at the same time remain dedicated to helping \r\nmake the whole world a better place. Everyone who \r\nwishes to contribute to eradicating poverty, supporting \r\npeacekeeping missions and solving the migration crisis, \r\nas well as handling the causes and effects of climate \r\nchange, can still count on us. For Europe, isolationism \r\nhas never been and never will be an option. We are \r\nalways ready to listen to the good and sound advice \r\nfrom our friends on the unprecedented refugee and \r\nmigrant crisis that we face today.\r\nThe myth prevails that Europe is the only rich \r\nplace on Earth. That is not true. There are other places \r\ncomparable to us in terms of wealth, but for some \r\nreason refugees and migrants are not f lowing there. \r\nThat is because wealth is not the only element that \r\ndetermines the place where people choose the future \r\nof their children. Values such as tolerance, openness, \r\nrespect for diversity, freedom, human rights and those \r\nenshrined in the Geneva Convention are also a magnet \r\nattracting them to us.\r\nAnd we refuse to change in those respects. If in \r\nEurope we are engaged in animated discussions on \r\nrelocation quotas, it is because we care; it is because \r\nwe seek to be as effective and as inclusive as possible. \r\nBut establishing quotas are just a small part of what \r\nEurope is already doing to help those who flee wars and \r\npersecution. By contrast, many countries represented \r\nhere deal with that problem in a much simpler way, \r\nnamely, by not allowing migrants and refugees to enter \r\ntheir territories at all. That is why suggesting that Europe \r\nrepresents an example of poor treatment or indifference \r\ntowards asylum-seekers is sheer hypocrisy. In fact, the \r\nopposite is true, as we can see from the direction of \r\ntheir travel. No one seems to be escaping from Europe, \r\nwhile people from all over Eurasia and Africa are \r\ncoming to Europe. The crisis we are talking about has \r\nglobal dimensions and demands a global solution. First \r\nof all, it demands global solidarity. Everyone can offer \r\nhelp to the refugees, and those who do not want to \r\nshould at least refrain from hiding their indifference by \r\ncriticizing Europe for doing too little.\r\nIt is no coincidence that the general debate this \r\nyear is focused mainly on the situation in the Middle \r\n15-29431 41/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nEast, especially in Syria. Let us have no illusions. \r\nSyria’s crisis will not be resolved unless a common \r\ndenominator of interests is found among the regional \r\nplayers. But a peace plan must not be only a formula \r\nfor defining a new division of spheres of influence; \r\nhere in the United Nations we should speak not only \r\nabout the interests of the regional Powers but, above \r\nall, about the interests of millions of Syrians, including \r\nthe internally displaced and refugees. The fight against \r\nterrorism is no doubt important in that context; that is \r\nwhy we welcome the fact that this objective is gaining \r\nthe support of new and quite unexpected allies. But we \r\ncannot overlook the fact that many refugees are f leeing \r\nState terrorism, which is demonstrated dramatically by \r\nthe case of Syria.\r\nEurope, which every day witnesses the tragedies of \r\nmillions of Syrian refugees, must be their advocate. We \r\nall want to see stable States in the region. Stabilization \r\nis a value beyond any dispute, but stability cannot be \r\nwon by the use of barrel bombs and chemical weapons \r\nagainst civilians. Today, the circle of those proposing \r\nthe idea that Bashar Al-Assad should be part of Syria’s \r\ntransition is growing, yet we cannot forget that millions \r\nof people have f led his horrific methods of trying to \r\nsecure stability in Syria. During my trips to the region, \r\nI was told that Al-Assad’s victory would lead only to \r\nfurther exodus. The only goal and intention of a peace \r\nplan for Syria must be to make it possible for the people \r\nto start leading normal lives in the region once again. \r\nThat message, and that message alone, will be consistent \r\nwith the values of the international community and the \r\nEuropean Union, and with the values that the United \r\nNations has held dear for more than 70 years.\r\nThis year will also be crucial in the global efforts \r\nto fight the causes and consequences of climate change. \r\nOver the past days and weeks, we have listened with \r\ngreat hope and satisfaction to the pledges of leaders \r\ncommitted to fighting global warming. Europe is \r\ndetermined that the Paris Climate Change Conference \r\nwill be a breakthrough, symbolizing our readiness to \r\nundertake unified action in confronting that global \r\nproblem.\r\nWith a pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions \r\nto 40 per cent of its 1990 levels, Europe remains in \r\nthe lead of that process, but fighting global warming \r\nis not a sports competition. Victory is possible when \r\neverybody moves in the same direction and at a similar \r\npace. That is why we invite all Member States to take \r\npart in that common endeavour. Without a global \r\nagreement, Europe’s isolated efforts will be impractical. \r\nWhat matters for Europe is practical effects and not \r\nideological fervour. Global challenges must be dealt \r\nwith multilaterally or they will not be dealt with at all. \r\nWe all have a duty to make the international community \r\nmean something real. We are facing multiple global \r\nemergencies. Let them pave the way to forge a global \r\ncommunity that is truly strong, truly global and truly \r\nreal.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the European \r\nCouncil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English \r\ninterpretation by the delegation): The United Nations, \r\nwhich this year commemorates the seventieth \r\nanniversary of its founding, brings together people \r\nwho do not easily despair even in the face of \r\ndesperate circumstances. What else can explain the \r\nOrganization’s ability to withstand such adversity and \r\nto arrive at this moment? The Ebola virus has spread \r\nwildly. Extremism is running rampant. And now an \r\nimmense tide of refugees is attempting to f lee from \r\nhorror, with their very lives at risk. We must address \r\nwhatever challenges arise, under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations. Each Member State must bring its own \r\ndistinctive capabilities to the struggle.\r\nJapan has a history of supporting nation-building \r\nin a wide range of places. We have worked extensively \r\nto enhance human resources, and we have given our \r\nutmost in humanitarian assistance and in the promotion \r\nof women’s rights. Now more than ever, Japan wishes \r\nto offer its wealth of experience unstintingly. Japan will \r\nfurther enhance its assistance for refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons from Syria and Iraq. In monetary \r\nterms, our assistance for 2015 comes to approximately \r\n42/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\n$810 million, triple the amount we provided last year. \r\nIn Lebanon, we will spend $2 million in new assistance \r\nmeasures. We will leverage that amount in order to give \r\nmomentum to the collaboration between humanitarian \r\nand development actors. We will also provide \r\napproximately $2.5 million in humanitarian assistance \r\nto neighbour countries of the European Union that are \r\ngrappling with the influx of refugees and migrants, \r\nsuch as the Republic of Serbia and the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia.\r\nEach of those assistance measures is an emergency \r\ncountermeasure that Japan is able to implement. At the \r\nsame time, however, our steadfast principle is always \r\nto endeavour to return to the root causes of a problem \r\nand to improve the situation on the ground. In order \r\nto bring stability to the daily lives of the Iraqi people, \r\nit is vital to ensure that they have dependable water \r\nsupply and sewage systems. Taking those programmes \r\ninto account, Japan is preparing assistance worth \r\napproximately $750 million to help build peace and \r\nfully consolidate peace across the Middle East and \r\nAfrica.\r\nIt is important to look squarely at the facts. Behind \r\nthe present tide of refugees is a far greater number of \r\npeople who are unable even to f lee and become refugees. \r\nRebuilding devastated countries and transforming them \r\ninto places that allow people to resume the pursuit of \r\nhappiness may seem like a roundabout way of reaching \r\nour goal, but promoting and cultivating each human \r\nbeing’s abilities and capacity to fight fear and want \r\nat the grass-roots level is in fact the shortest path to \r\nthat end. That strong belief has guided Japan’s policy \r\nof prioritizing the promotion of education and health \r\nand, in particular, the importance of strengthening \r\nwomen of all ages. Our policy seeks to fully ensure \r\nhuman security. I am extremely pleased that such \r\nefforts to value each individual were thoroughly \r\nincorporated within the 2030 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (resolution 70/1) set forth by the United Nations \r\ncommunity.\r\nJapan wishes to create an environment in which \r\nmothers of newborns are free to focus exclusively on \r\nthe healthy growth of their children. In reflecting on \r\nthat premise, I came across a photograph that portrayed \r\nthe contents of a bag carried by a female refugee. I \r\nasked myself what people would pack in the one bag \r\nthey take with them when f leeing hardship? Abessa, \r\na 20-year-old woman who crossed the Mediterranean \r\nSea on a rubber raft, was able to bring very little with \r\nher when she f led a Palestinian refugee camp south of \r\nDamascus. Everything in the photograph was for her \r\n10-month old daughter: a clean change of socks, a hat \r\nand a single jar of baby food.\r\nBut as I contemplated that photograph, my eyes were \r\ndrawn to a notebook that had been wrapped carefully in \r\nplastic to protect it from getting wet. I recognized it as \r\na handbook on maternal and child health that Japan has \r\nbeen distributing in refugee camps in Syria. In Japan, \r\nall pregnant women receive this handbook, in which \r\nthey can keep records about their own health and that \r\nof their child. This handbook system has been in place \r\nfor more than 70 years.\r\nWho among all the mothers who smile sweetly at \r\nthe hand-written records of their child’s heights and \r\nweights could wish for that same child to grow up to \r\nbecome an apostle of fear? Each woman’s handbook \r\nis a record of her prayers for her child to grow up \r\nhealthy. Her notebook acquires a power of its own: the \r\npower of the mother’s wish for her child’s life not to \r\nbe squandered. We have distributed maternal and child \r\nhealth handbooks in refugee camps in Palestine, Syria, \r\nand Jordan in the hope that a mother’s love can transform \r\nthe soil that sometimes gives rise to despair and fear. \r\nWe know that some women continue to treasure those \r\nhope-infused handbooks even during their exodus. I am \r\nstruck by the fact that the concept of human security, \r\nwhich seeks to empower each individual, has produced \r\nsuch eloquent, albeit bitter results.\r\nThe rule of law and the principle of equality before \r\nthe law are values that Japan respects above all others. \r\nThe extension of those principles also begins with \r\nfostering human capacity. I would like to share with the \r\nAssembly the story of a young Japanese woman who has \r\nbeen giving her all through Japan’s training assistance \r\nprogramme for police officers. In order to break with the \r\nvery root of violence and fear, it is critical to cultivate \r\ngood police personnel and good police governance. \r\nIn that conviction, we have been directing our efforts \r\nat training police personnel in Afghanistan and many \r\nother locations. Through the Japan International \r\nCooperation Agency, Japan has been steadily providing \r\nsuch assistance to the national police force of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo since 2004. More \r\nthan 20,000 police personnel to date, including women \r\nand a number of former armed insurgent soldiers, have \r\nreceived such training. Our motto has been to cultivate \r\na police force that is friendly towards the local people.\r\n15-29431 43/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency \r\nwas responsible for developing and implementing the \r\ntraining plan, and women have consistently been in \r\ncharge of Japan’s staff on the ground in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. One such woman was called a \r\n“little giant” when she first arrived. Seen alongside her \r\nmale police colleagues, she was indeed small in stature. \r\nyet she was dubbed a giant because she never f linched \r\nfrom difficulties and took the initiative to grapple with \r\nissues, making full use of the French language skills she \r\nhad acquired. The national police personnel respected \r\nand trusted her. Two years ago, here in the General \r\nAssembly (see A/68/PV.12), I emphasized that Japan \r\nhas recently made a point of establishing itself as a \r\nproactive contributor to peace, based on the principle of \r\ninternational cooperation. The woman I just mentioned \r\nis one of the Japanese individuals dedicated to this and \r\nworking on the front lines.\r\nI am one of Japan’s biggest champions of ensuring \r\nthat women take on many of the roles that will shape \r\nour country’s future. In our external assistance efforts, \r\ntoo, we emphasize policies and measures aimed at \r\nimproving women’s safety, health and well-being and \r\nupholding their human rights. In countries recovering \r\nfrom civil war, Japanese women have been making \r\nsplendid contributions in support of those working to \r\nuphold the rule of law, something I am particularly \r\nproud of. On a number of previous occasions, I have \r\nurged the international community to ensure that the \r\ntwenty-first century will be an era in which women’s \r\nhuman rights are protected.\r\nToday, I am also pleased to be able to report \r\nthat Japan has finalized its action plan on women’s \r\nparticipation and protection based on Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000), important aspects of which \r\ninclude protecting women and girls from violence and \r\nproviding them with basic health services. Moreover, \r\nthis year, for the second consecutive year, we hosted \r\nWAW! 2015, the World Assembly for Women, holding \r\nmeaningful discussions with a view to creating a \r\nsociety in which women can shine.\r\nI believe the United Nations is a venue where \r\noptimistic realists can come together. It does not give \r\nitself up to impotent despair of the future, but neither does \r\nit avert its eyes from reality. That is how it has shaped \r\nthe 70 years of its history. And I, too, feel compelled to \r\nface up squarely to reality on several issues, the first \r\nof which is North Korea. In that regard, Japan intends \r\nto work in coordination with other relevant countries \r\nin an effort to arrive at a comprehensive resolution \r\nof the outstanding issues, including those related to \r\nabductions, nuclear power and missiles.\r\nThis year, the seventieth anniversary of the atomic \r\nbombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, was one in \r\nwhich we relived our grief. Regrettably, however, it \r\nseems that in some places nuclear arsenals, with no \r\ntransparency, continue to grow. Moreover, this year’s \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons failed to come \r\nup with guidelines for future nuclear disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation. We believe that the United States \r\nand Russia should continue to reduce their nuclear \r\nweapon stockpiles, while we also insist that other \r\nStates possessing nuclear weapons should also work to \r\nreduce their arsenals. In its determination to eliminate \r\nnuclear weapons completely, Japan is preparing a new \r\ndraft resolution aimed at promoting united action on \r\nthe issue by the international community that I am sure \r\nmany countries will support.\r\nThis year, as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the founding of the United Nations, a major push for \r\nreform of the Security Council has begun. During the \r\nlast session of the General Assembly, the assiduous \r\nefforts of dedicated individuals and various countries \r\ngreatly intensified the discussion of Security Council \r\nreform. And two weeks ago, here in this very Hall, \r\nthat enthusiasm was passed on to the current session \r\nas the entire Assembly applauded (see A/70/PV.1) . \r\nEmboldened by that enthusiasm and by my conviction \r\nregarding the role that Japan should play in that process, \r\nI will continue to work to achieve reform of the Security \r\nCouncil with the cooperation of the President and \r\nMember States. Japan hopes to become a permanent \r\nmember of the Council and to make a commensurate \r\ncontribution.\r\nHere I would like to emphasize three points. First \r\nand foremost, Japan has remained a strictly peace-loving \r\nnation during the 70 years since the end of the Second \r\nWorld War, and we have accumulated a successful \r\nrecord in our efforts to foster peace and prosperity \r\naround the world. Japan worked hard diplomatically in \r\nCambodia and Timor-Leste, first by sending personnel \r\nto participate in peacekeeping operations there and \r\nlater by providing assistance over the long term.\r\nThe first of the three stages involved in \r\npeacekeeping operations is decision-making, in which \r\nwe determine what is to be done and where. That is \r\n44/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nfollowed by the necessary preparations of personnel \r\nand financing and, lastly, by the process of launching \r\nphysical operations on the ground. Japan has been able \r\nto help to bridge the information gaps that tend to occur \r\nbetween those stages. We have also been able to make \r\na positive and major contribution by ensuring that we \r\ntake full responsibility for our decisions and actions at \r\nevery stage. Right now, members of an engineering unit \r\nof Japan’s self-defence forces are working around the \r\nclock in South Sudan. In Kenya, experts from our ground \r\nself-defence force are training members of the Kenyan, \r\nUgandan, Tanzanian and Rwandan armed forces on the \r\nbest ways to operate heavy engineering equipment so as \r\nto deal with the problems that arise when peacekeeping \r\noperations become hopelessly trapped in areas where \r\nroads and bridges have been destroyed. We also recently \r\nmade changes to our domestic legal framework that will \r\nenable us to contribute more broadly to peacekeeping \r\noperations going forward.\r\nSecondly, Japan is a country that values ownership \r\nand partnership. We have been of the view for many \r\nyears that if we are to overcome despair and improve our \r\nwelfare, it is important to give equal consideration both \r\nto the wishes and intentions of the parties concerned and \r\nto international cooperation. Our ultimate objective is \r\nto ensure that the people themselves gain the ownership \r\nthat will enable them to determine the direction of their \r\nown lives, and by emphasizing that approach to arrive \r\nat the concept of valuing human security.\r\nMy third point is that Japan always strives to listen \r\nactively to the voices of the parties concerned. Three \r\ndays ago, for the third consecutive year, I hosted the \r\nJapan-African Regional Economic Communities \r\nSummit Roundtable, meeting with leaders from the \r\nAfrican countries conerned. For the past 20 years, Japan \r\nhas also hosted the Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development (TICAD), and next year for \r\nthe first time TICAD will convene in Africa, where I \r\nhope to be able to listen to an even richer spectrum of \r\nAfrican voices. Last night I also met with leaders from \r\nthe Pacific island countries to discuss such matters as \r\nobserving 5 November in common as World Tsunami \r\nDay, as well as conducting training and capacity-\r\nbuilding related to tsunamis.\r\nJapan became a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the first time in 1958, two years \r\nafter it was admitted to membership in the United \r\nNations. If we are again selected this year thanks to \r\nthe gracious support of all those here, it will be our \r\neleventh time serving on the Council.\r\nMore than any other country, Japan has subjected \r\nitself to review by its peers. The three points I have \r\nnoted today represent some of Japan’s strengths, \r\nsomething that all here will concur with, based on the \r\npath we have trodden so far. We intend to use those \r\nstrengths to help strengthen the United Nations. We are \r\na people who have always seen in the two letters “UN” \r\na certain radiance. Bearing the standard of its role as \r\na proactive contributor to peace based on the principle \r\nof international cooperation, Japan is determined to \r\nundertake reform of the Security Council in order \r\nto transform the United Nations into a body relevant \r\nto the twenty-first century and subsequently, as a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council, to fulfil its \r\nresponsibilities by making still greater contributions to \r\nworld peace and prosperity.\r\nIn conclusion, I look forward to Members’ kind \r\nunderstanding.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Japan for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Highness Sheikh Jaber \r\nAl-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of \r\nthe State of Kuwait, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nSheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, on behalf of the Government and the people \r\nof Kuwait, I extend our sincere congratulations to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and his country, \r\nthe Kingdom of Denmark, on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session. We \r\n15-29431 45/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nbelieve that his vast experience in political affairs will \r\nenable him to conduct the deliberations of this session \r\nwisely and ably. We wish him success in that endeavour.\r\nWe also note the successful manner with which \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, conducted the \r\ndeliberations during the previous session. In that regard, \r\nI also would like to pay tribute to the tremendous efforts \r\nof Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in leading the \r\nOrganization in accordance with his vision and ideas \r\nbased on the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, while simultaneously striving to \r\nachieve the Charter’s goals in a sustainable manner by \r\nconfronting the manifold risks and challenges that are \r\nengulfing the world.\r\nOnce again, we express our most sincere \r\ncondolences and heartfelt sympathy to the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia in connection with the stampede that \r\nresulted in numerous deaths and injuries at Mina during \r\nthe Haj. While we pray to Allah, the Almighty, to accept \r\nthe victims in His Grace and grant them eternal peace, \r\nand solace and fortitude to their bereaved families, we \r\nalso pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. We \r\nappreciate and are grateful for the enormous human \r\nand material assets that the King, his Government and \r\npeople of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia make available \r\nevery year to organize and facilitate the Haj and to \r\nprovide every comfort to the pilgrims.\r\nThis year, the international community is \r\ncelebrating 70 years of service by this great leading \r\nworld Organization, during which it has worked to \r\ncreate a world in which humankind can enjoy peace \r\nand security during a period marked by exceptional \r\ncircumstances — a period when the political, economic, \r\nsocial and humanitarian challenges in the world have \r\nincreased. During that time, the United Nations has \r\ncontinued to provide its service in accordance with the \r\naims and objectives of its Charter in order to surmount \r\nthose growing challenges and confront them by creative \r\nmeans. Those undertakings have to a great extent \r\nbecome history to be taught to future generations in \r\norder to demonstrate the importance and inevitability \r\nof international cooperation and the capacity of the \r\nUnited Nations system to continue its boundless giving \r\nto the peoples and countries of the world.\r\nPerhaps one of the most outstanding milestones \r\non the path to the success of the United Nations is \r\nembodied in the adoption of the post-2015 development \r\ngoals in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment with its Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) (resolution 70/1), which can be considered \r\nto be an extension of the international community’s \r\nefforts based on the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). The MDGs have, by and large, achieved their \r\npurposes, and the United Nations has surpassed its \r\ngoals in facing up to the challenges that it is confronted \r\nwith, and has proceeded to implement comprehensive, \r\nradical solutions in the areas of human development \r\nand individual rights. That includes the goal of totally \r\neliminating poverty in its multiple forms, ensuring that \r\nall human beings enjoy equal rights in dignity and access \r\nto education and health care, as well as ensuring political \r\nparticipation, gender equality, youth empowerment and \r\naddressing the ongoing environmental degradation.\r\nIn that regard, the State of Kuwait affirm its \r\neffective participation in the international partnership \r\nto fully implement the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nover the next 15 years. That is based on Kuwait’s \r\nfirm belief in the Charter of the United Nations and \r\non Kuwait’s support for the Organization. Kuwait will \r\ncontinue its funding in appreciation of the certificate \r\nof appreciation presented by the Secretary-General to \r\nSheikh Al Sabah, the Amir of the State of Kuwait, as \r\na humanitarian leader. That award is tantamount to a \r\nmedal of honour for the leadership displayed by the \r\nGovernment and the people of Kuwait in saving the \r\nlives of millions of people. Indeed, Kuwait occupies \r\nfirst place in the provision of humanitarian assistance \r\nglobally as a proportion of its gross national income, the \r\nhighest percentage provided by a donor State, according \r\nto the Global Humanitarian Assistance Report 2014.\r\nFurthermore, the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic \r\nDevelopment continues its leading role in providing \r\ndevelopment assistance to developing countries, \r\nwithout any regard for geographical location, religious \r\nbelief or nationality. Since its establishment, in 1961, \r\nmore than 100 countries in all parts of the globe \r\nhave benefited from the Fund’s projects, which total \r\n$18 billion. Over the next 15 years, the Kuwait Fund for \r\nArab Economic Development will continue to provide \r\nloans and create development programmes within its \r\noperational programmes, which are based on its own \r\nresources, including $15 billion to meet the needs and \r\nrequirements of sustainable development.\r\nUndoubtedly, it is important for the international \r\ncommunity to work to consolidate and promote the \r\nexistence of peaceful societies that are based on \r\n46/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\njustice and are free from all manifestations of violence \r\nand radicalism. That confirms the principle that \r\nno sustainable development can take place without \r\nsecurity, and no security can exist without sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThere has been a proliferation of conflicts and civil \r\nwars in our world today, accompanied by the emergence \r\nof violence and the dangers of radicalism and terrorism, \r\nwith their multiple causes and employing diverse means \r\nin a number of countries, particularly in the region of \r\nthe Middle East. It is civilians who make up the majority \r\nof the victims. The international community must stand \r\nup to those challenges, which threaten international \r\npeace and security; it must address their causes and dry \r\nup the resources that fuel them.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen and its brotherly people \r\nface serious challenges owing to the intransigence of \r\nthe Houthi militias and their insistence on breaching \r\ntheir commitments and on threatening the security and \r\nstability of our region and our countries. That situation \r\nrequires strong action to support the legitimate \r\nGovernment of Yemen and to achieve peace and \r\nstability in our region. We would like to emphasize \r\nthe need to commit to the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\ninitiative, comply with the outcome of the National \r\nReconciliation Conference and respond to the efforts of \r\nthe Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen \r\nin that regard. The State of Kuwait has not ignored \r\nthe humanitarian needs of the Yemeni people. Kuwait \r\nannounced, upon instructions from His Highness \r\nSheikh Al-Sabah, the donation of $100 million to meet \r\nthe needs of Yemen.\r\nIn Syria, as that disaster enters its fifth year, the \r\nscope of humanitarian suffering is exacerbating the \r\nmultiple other parameters of the crisis. The number of \r\ndead and injured are rising, and the number of refugees \r\nand internally displaced persons continues to increase. \r\nThe f low of Syrian migrants and refugees to Europe \r\nattests to the magnitude of the crisis. We have warned \r\nagainst the dire consequences of the situation on Syria, \r\nthe Syrian people, their neighbours and the entire world. \r\nIn view of the aforementioned, the State of Kuwait \r\nreiterates its firm and principled position, namely, \r\nthat the solution to that disaster can be achieved only \r\nthrough peaceful, political means, as opposed to other \r\nmeans, whose price would be paid by our brothers in \r\nSyria. In that regard, we welcome the endeavours of the \r\nUnited Nations and those of the Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, \r\nwhich seek to mobilize efforts to implement the Geneva \r\ncommuniqué (S/2012/522, annex), issued in 2012, aimed \r\nat establishing a transitional Government that is fully \r\nfunctional, and at maintaining the territorial integrity \r\nof Syria, preserving the coherence of Syrian society \r\nand meeting the needs for dignity of the Syrian people.\r\nWithin the framework of supporting international \r\nefforts to alleviate the humanitarian suffering in \r\nSyria, since 2013 the State of Kuwait has hosted three \r\nsuccessive international donor conferences to lend \r\nsupport to efforts to improve the situation in that \r\ncountry. The pledges made at those three conferences \r\namounted to approximately $7.15 billion, of which the \r\nState of Kuwait contributed $1.3 billion. The bulk of \r\nthe money pledged has been delivered to the United \r\nNations specialized agencies and other international, \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations \r\nin the humanitarian affairs field. The remainder of \r\nthose contributions has been distributed through local \r\ncharitable institutions working in the humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment fields.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Libya, we are closely \r\nfollowing the agreement announced in the Moroccan \r\ncity of Skhirat by the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General for Libya, aimed at forming a \r\nnational consensus Government that would put an end \r\nto the fighting. We look forward to a positive response \r\nto that initiative from our brothers in Libya, so that \r\nthey can stop the bloodshed, preserve the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of their homeland and restore \r\nsecurity and stability throughout Libya.\r\nOur region faces exceptionally delicate dangers \r\nthat threaten its security and stability. They stem from \r\nterrorist and violent groups that commit, supposedly \r\nin the name of Islam, criminal acts rejected by all \r\nreligions. The brutal crimes committed by the so-called \r\nDaesh/Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant have spread \r\ndeath and destruction, particularly in Iraq and Syria, \r\nand are a threat to international peace and security. A \r\nmuch-needed international coalition has been formed to \r\ntackle those terrorists. The State of Kuwait took part in \r\nthe establishment of the coalition by providing logistical \r\nsupport. The practices of that terrorist organization \r\nhave extended to the State of Kuwait. Daesh committed \r\na cowardly terrorist act, targeting a mosque during the \r\nholy month of Ramadan, which killed and injured a \r\nnumber of our citizens. The national unity and cohesion \r\nbetween the people and the leadership of Kuwait made \r\nthose who wished Kuwait ill miss their mark, thereby \r\n15-29431 47/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nreaffirming a long, honourable national history that has \r\nwitnessed f loods of sacrifices for the sake of the unity \r\nand stability of the State of Kuwait.\r\nIn the humanitarian field, the State of Kuwait has \r\nalso responded to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi \r\npeople. Kuwait announced the donation of $200 million \r\nto assist our Iraqi brothers in alleviating the suffering \r\ncaused by the brutal practices of the Daesh terrorist \r\ngroup. Work is ongoing to disburse that donation, in \r\ncooperation with the competent parties in Iraq and \r\ninternational organizations. We reaffirm our support \r\nfor all the measures taken by the Iraqi Government to \r\npreserve the security, stability and territorial integrity \r\nof Iraq. In that regard, the State of Kuwait reiterates \r\nits firm and principled position rejecting all forms of \r\nterrorism, extremism and intolerance, irrespective \r\nof their causes or motives and whatever their sources \r\nor the identity of their perpetrators. Kuwait stresses \r\nthat promoting a culture of tolerance and coexistence \r\namong peoples and nations is among the top priorities \r\nin the approach that it follows in its internal and \r\nexternal policies. Such policies are anchored in the \r\ntolerant Islamic sharia law and in the importance \r\nKuwait attaches to maintaining the links between \r\ndevelopment, security and human rights, as it works \r\nto develop a global strategy to combat terrorism and \r\nachieve international peace and security.\r\nThe international and regional efforts that seek to \r\nlay the foundation for peace in the Middle East face \r\nmany impediments as a result of Israel’s intransigence. \r\nIsrael continues its illicit expansionist policies by \r\nbuilding illegal settlements on occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory and by detaining thousands of Palestinians \r\nin its prisons and detention centres. Its repeated acts \r\nof aggression, including the attack on Gaza during the \r\npast year, has left in its wake unprecedented destruction \r\nand loss of life and property. That is in addition to its \r\ncontinued imposition of an illegal and inhumane siege \r\non Gaza, and the escalation of its attacks on the holy \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque and Muslims there. Those attacks are \r\nin violation of all humanitarian standards, international \r\nlaws and the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nThat makes it incumbent upon the United Nations, and \r\nthe Security Council in particular, to carry out their \r\nresponsibilities and continue to put pressure on and \r\ncompel Israel, at all levels, to accept the resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy, grant the Palestinian people \r\ntheir legitimate political rights, and recognize their \r\nindependent status and sovereignty over their territory, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as their capital, in accordance with \r\nthe borders of 4 June 1967 and in line with the principle \r\nof land for peace, the Quartet’s road map and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative.\r\nIn the same regional framework, the State of \r\nKuwait welcomes Security Council resolution 2231 \r\n(2015), which endorsed the comprehensive agreement \r\non the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action concluded \r\nbetween the five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, plus Germany, and the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran. The agreement was the result of diplomatic efforts \r\nover a number of years aimed at addressing the Iranian \r\nnuclear situation. The State of Kuwait hopes that the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran will continue to cooperate and \r\nfully implement the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\nand adhere to its responsibilities under the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. In addition, \r\nKuwait hopes that Iran will respond to the efforts of the \r\ncountries of the region to lay the foundations of good \r\nneighbourly relations based on cooperation, mutual \r\nrespect and non-interference in internal affairs, and that \r\nit will end its occupation of the three Emirati islands, \r\nall of which will contribute to reducing tensions and to \r\nsecurity and stability in the region.\r\nIn that context, we call upon Israel to accede to \r\nthe Non-Proliferation Treaty and to subject all of its \r\nnuclear facilities to the inspection and supervision of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency, in compliance \r\nwith the resolution adopted at the 1995 NPT Review \r\nand Extension Conference, which called for the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and all \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize the \r\nadherence of the State of Kuwait to the multilateral \r\ninternational system, as well as to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. I \r\nwould like to underscore our belief in the importance \r\nand necessity of exerting all efforts to ensure the \r\ncontinuity and generosity of our great Organization \r\nthrough the fulfilment of all States’ obligations and \r\nresponsibilities, as pledged in international conventions \r\nand conferences. That will, in turn, contribute to \r\nfinding just and fair solutions to global threats and \r\nchallenges, while according due attention to the higher \r\ngoal of maintaining international peace and security.\r\n48/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Matteo Renzi, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Republic of Italy\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Matteo Renzi, President \r\nof the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Renzi (Italy) (spoke in Italian; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is with gratitude and \r\npride that I come here today to express the voice of the \r\nItalian people, a generous and responsible people, who \r\nevery day have shown their commitment to saving the \r\nlives of hundreds of their brothers and sisters in the \r\nheart of the Mediterranean region.\r\nThis Hall calls for profound thinking rather than \r\nslogans. In every part of the world, political life is more \r\nand more fixated on the present. It is tied to discussions \r\nshaped by 24/7 news stations, the Internet and social \r\nmedia. Let me be clear. I belong to a generation for \r\nwhom social media represent an extraordinary tool, a \r\nhorizon of freedom that allows us to change lives and \r\nprospects. There is nevertheless the risk of reducing \r\nthat horizon to a discussion of the next opinion poll \r\nor tweet. I think we should reject what has become a \r\ndictatorship of the moment, and take the time to pay \r\nhomage to this Hall for its efforts in engaging in more \r\nmeaningful reflection.\r\nI am thinking of my country, which, on a map, \r\nappears to be shaped like a bridge, a bridge connecting \r\nNorth and South, Europe and Africa and East and \r\nWest, a bridge that spans from the Middle East to the \r\nBalkans. Because of its geography, and especially its \r\nculture, Italy has always been a kind of extraordinary \r\ncultural laboratory affected by influences of every \r\nkind. That is the reason that we were the first country \r\nin Europe to grasp the momentous dimension of what is \r\nhappening in the Mediterranean region. From the very \r\nbeginning — even in this Hall last year — we have said \r\nthat the refugee question is not a question of numbers \r\n(see A/69/PV.9). The problem of migration is not one of \r\norganization or statistics. The problem is fear, the fear \r\nthat runs through our societies and that we must take \r\nseriously if we wish to defeat it.\r\nIn Greek mythology, Phobos was the god of fear, \r\nable to paralyse the best armies and cause the most \r\neasily fought battles to be lost. That is why the glorious \r\nand ancient city of Sparta built a great temple to Phobos \r\nand did everything to gain his favour. Europe was born \r\nto defeat fear and replace it with the ideal of courage, \r\npeace, cooperation and civilization. And for a long \r\ntime, Europe embodied that ideal. Over the past 70 \r\nyears, our continent has left behind centuries of war \r\nand civil war. Europe had become a true miracle. For \r\nthose like me, who as a young man witnessed the fall \r\nof the Berlin Wall and found in that event a reason to \r\ndevote my life to public service, to see new walls going \r\nup today is intolerable.\r\nEurope was reborn to tear down walls, not to \r\nbuild them. That is why Italy is on the front line in \r\nrescuing thousands of migrants f leeing from war and \r\ndespair. For that same reason, I had the privilege of \r\naccompanying Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on \r\none of our ships currently participating in the rescue \r\noperations. Addressing migratory f lows requires the \r\ncapacity to respond to that emergency with a global \r\nand comprehensive strategy. In that vein, Italy has \r\npartnered with African countries through a broad \r\narray of initiatives, and in particular with the African \r\nUnion, a cooperation about which I an the opportunity \r\nto speak recently at the third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, \r\nwhich produced the Addis Ababa Action Agenda.\r\nIn the 70 years since the birth of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations in San Francisco, the Organization has \r\nlearned how crucial its role is. It has had the wisdom to \r\nrecognize its mistakes and the strength to correct them \r\nby writing a new chapter that will ensure a better future \r\nfor all of our children. I think that it will take an effort \r\non the part of everyone, and Italy will not shirk from its \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nThat is why we decided to present our candidature \r\nto the Security Council for a non-permanent seat for \r\n2017-2018, with the ideal in mind of building the peace \r\n15-29431 49/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nof tomorrow. We believe that it is the job of each one of \r\nus here today to create an alternative to the culture of \r\nviolence and nihilism exemplified by the recent crises \r\nin the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Europe and at \r\nthe borders of Europe. I am thinking, for example, of the \r\nconsolidation of the ceasefire in Ukraine. I am thinking \r\nof the great joy with which we welcomed the news of \r\nthe agreement between the United States and Cuba, one \r\nof extraordinary historic proportions. I am thinking \r\nof the hope that each of us now has as a consequence \r\nof the agreement with Iran on that country’s nuclear \r\nprogramme, which begins a new hopeful phase.\r\nWhile we are committed to the implementation of \r\nthat agreement, we also firmly reiterate the right of the \r\npeople and the State of Israel to exist. Only through \r\ndialogue and negotiation will we be able to find a future \r\nfor coming generations. Moreover, on the delicate \r\nquestion of Israel and Palestine, there is no alternative \r\nto dialogue. It is essential to return to the negotiating \r\ntable, with the goal of reaching a solution based on two \r\nStates living side-by-side in peace and security.\r\nThis open debate of the General Assembly has \r\nbeen characterized by many discussions on Syria. All \r\nof us have acknowledged and felt, on a very personal \r\nlevel, the failure that years of inertia has produced. \r\nWe believe that the only way out of that quagmire is \r\nthrough a political solution that leads to a process of \r\ngenuine transition. That will work only if we have the \r\ncourage to stare reality in the face and acknowledge the \r\npresence of an enemy of unprecedented danger at our \r\ndoors, namely, Daesh, the embodiment of extremism \r\nand terrorism. Through its Carabinieri corps, which \r\nplays an important role in Italy and the world, Italy is \r\nproud to lead the coalition for training the Iraqi police \r\nforce. We know that the work of the security forces is \r\ndecisive in ensuring daily security, enabling a family \r\nto return home without incident and enabling a mother \r\nto reassure her children. We will continue working \r\nwith the global coalition to counter ISIL, in particular \r\nthe United States and Saudi Arabia, and will maintain \r\nour leadership role in the working group to counter \r\nfinancing for Daesh.\r\nAt the same time, we underscore that Daesh is not \r\nlimited to the specific region of the Middle East, even \r\nif there is an extraordinary mosaic of pluralism and \r\nbeauty there. Daesh may reaffirm itself with strength in \r\nAfrica, starting with Libya. From this rostrum, I renew \r\nmy appeal to all the parties who hope for peace and a \r\nunified nation in Libya. We must unite our forces. Our \r\nLibyan brothers and sisters must know that they are \r\nnot alone, that the General Assembly has not forgotten \r\nthem. Italy is ready to collaborate with a national \r\nunity Government and to restore cooperation in key \r\nareas so as to give Libya back its future. If the new \r\nLibyan Government asks us, Italy is ready to take on \r\nthe leadership role in a mechanism, authorized by the \r\ninternational community, to assist in the stabilization \r\nof the country.\r\nThere are many reasons for our role in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism. It is a battle for values, a battle for \r\nculture. The terrorists want us to die. Failing that, they \r\nwant us to live under their rules. That is why the battle \r\nthat we are waging is a battle against darkness and \r\nfear, because fear is the playground of terrorism. The \r\nfirst area in which we see that is that of culture. When \r\nterrorists attack Palmyra or the Bardo Museum in \r\nTunisia, or a school or a university, from Asia to Africa, \r\nthey are not attacking the past, they are targeting our \r\nfuture.\r\nItaly is the country where the culture of the \r\nconservation of cultural assets was born. Proud of \r\nour roots and of our Renaissance, we have the highest \r\nconcentration of UNESCO cultural heritage sites in the \r\nworld. That is why, together with our partner countries \r\nand friends, we aspire to be the guardians of culture \r\nthroughout the world, carrying out concrete actions, \r\nboth here in New York and at UNESCO headquarters \r\nin Paris, through United4Heritage, the Blue Helmets \r\nof culture. On the basis of a model developed in our \r\ncountry, we are proposing the establishment of an \r\ninternational task force, with military and civilian \r\nmembers, for operations to protect and rebuild art \r\nhistorical sites. That is our identity. That task force will \r\nbe available to UNESCO, and it could be deployed in the \r\nframework of United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nLet us not forget that even Europe runs the risk, \r\nin the absence of a major educational project that \r\nwould show that the evil seed of terrorism is growing \r\non European soil as well. Let us not forget that what \r\nhas happened in recent months and weeks — from \r\nCharlie Hebdo in Paris to what took place in Belgium \r\nand in Denmark — involved women and men born in \r\nEuropean countries, raised and educated in European \r\ncountries and yet transformed into terrorists who \r\nsought to undermine human rights and the very \r\nraison d’être of our continent. I think, therefore, that \r\nit is important that we all succeed in this educational \r\nchallenge together and that our peacekeeping model, \r\n50/51 15-29431\r\nA/70/PV.16 29/09/2015\r\nwhich President Obama noted yesterday and for which \r\nwe thank him, can serve as an established model that \r\ncan be in deployed in various countries, such as is \r\nhappening now in Afghanistan. I wish to recall Italy’s \r\ncommitment to honouring the women and men who \r\nhave sacrificed their lives for our collective security, \r\nin particular in that country. We are proud of the work \r\nof our soldiers and civilians aimed at supporting the \r\nAfghan Government on the road to peace and prosperity.\r\nThe Security Council is at the centre of the \r\nchallenge. That is not a bureaucratic issue, but rather a \r\npolitical one. The Uniting for Consensus group is ready \r\nto continue to work with all members.\r\nHuman rights, which are today under attack, are for \r\nus a reference point at every level. I am thinking about \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and \r\npeace and security. I am thinking of resolution 69/186, \r\nadopted by the General Assembly last December, with its \r\nmoratorium on the death penalty, an issue on which we \r\nwill tirelessly work. I also recall the words that the Holy \r\nFather Pope Francis pronounced here (see A/70/PV.3) \r\nand at the United States Congress. The resolutions \r\nagainst forced and early marriage (resolution 68/148) \r\nand against female genital mutilation (resolution \r\n67/146) are clear signs of the shared commitment of our \r\nworld community.\r\nThe deep connection between peace and security \r\nand between human rights and development is also the \r\nmessage of the current Universal Exposition in Milan. \r\nThe slogan of Expo 2015, “Feeding the Planet: Energy \r\nfor Life”, is a message that brings together many of the \r\naspirations of the General Assembly, in particular that \r\nof promoting sustainable agriculture. I wish to make a \r\ncommitment, especially to the African countries, that \r\nwe will never stop working in that direction, bolstered \r\nby Italian know-how and the desire to work together. \r\nGuaranteeing access to food for all, fighting world \r\nhunger, changing consumption patterns, ensuring \r\nthe centrality of women as central stakeholders in \r\nagriculture, defending smallholder farmers, as well as \r\neasing tensions and conflicts caused by the degradation \r\nof arable land and the scarcity of water for irrigation, \r\nare not secondary issues.\r\nThe legacy of Expo Milan is assured by the Charter \r\nof Milan and by the commitments of each of us to \r\nfight climate change. Italy stands alongside Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and is mobilizing the necessary \r\nresources to ensure that the conferences in Lima and \r\nParis are successful.\r\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1), Italy \r\nhas accepted the challenge of the five Ps — people, \r\nprosperity, partnership, planet and peace, which we \r\nrecognize and which inspire our action for the future. \r\nBut let me say that Italy intends to contribute with \r\nstrength, in particular in those battles in which some \r\ncountries seem to be alone. In the next few weeks in \r\nMilan, we will welcome our partners, the small island \r\ndeveloping States, which are considered small States \r\nbut are actually great States for their value, to the events \r\non climate-change adaptation that will take place in \r\nmid-October at Expo Milan, and we will bring a large \r\ndelegation to Venice, where we will show participants, \r\nin one of the most beautiful artistic cities in the world, \r\nhow we are working to combat the risks associated with \r\nthe presence of high waters and the lack of attention on \r\nthe part of the international community.\r\nIn conclusion, as a candidate for a non-permanent \r\nseat on the Security Council, Italy wants the values we \r\nhave discussed to occupy a central place in the Security \r\nCouncil. But I do not want us to think of those values \r\nin an abstract way. I do not want us to forget that what \r\nbrings us here is not a document. It is a face; it is many \r\nfaces.\r\nIn Italian schools, our children learn about the \r\nstrong connection among the ancient civilizations of \r\nthe Mediterranean, Africa and the Middle East. Today, \r\nthose children are not just extras in a movie. They are \r\nthe reason why we are here today. We believe that of all \r\nthe values we teach our children at school we cannot \r\nforget that the first value is life.\r\nFaced with the migration crisis, many of us were \r\ndeeply moved this summer by the photo of a little \r\nboy named Aylan. He was a child from Kobani, who, \r\ntogether with his older brother, fell asleep without ever \r\nbeing able to see the future. He was photographed, \r\ndead, on the beach at Bodrum. We must not limit \r\nour commitment to the emotion of the moment. We \r\nmust bear that image in mind and commit to doing \r\nour best. Many children have died in the heart of the \r\nMediterranean. They died on the ships launched in the \r\ndirection of Europe by traffickers, the new slave traders \r\nof today. However, together with all of those children \r\nwho are no longer with us, I want to recall the names \r\nof children whom no one talks about: Yambambi, \r\n15-29431 51/51\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.16\r\nSalvatore, Idris Ibrahim and Francesca Marina. They \r\nare some of the children who were born on the ships \r\nof the Italian Marines and Coast Guard, which saved \r\nthousands of women, and in some cases enabled them \r\nto give birth on those ships. I wish to thank my fellow \r\ncitizens for the extraordinary work that they have \r\ncarried out. I want their names to be remembered with \r\nthe names of those who did not make it. Their heroic \r\nactions should serve as an admonishment for all of us. \r\nPolitics can be restored to dignity when we are aware of \r\nthe enormity of our challenges. The old Europe, born in \r\nthe name of courage, does not give in to fear. Italy will \r\nproudly do its part.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of \r\nItaly for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.05 p.m.\r\n"
