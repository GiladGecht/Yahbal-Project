I am \r\nconfident that, under your able leadership, this jubilee \r\nsession will meet our many hopes and expectations.\r\nI also congratulate all of us on the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations. The establishment \r\nof the Organization is one of the greatest achievements \r\nof humankind, a step that has consolidated nations \r\naround its shared aspirations and principles. The past \r\n70 years have been characterized by very important \r\npositive developments, namely, an end was put to \r\ncolonialism, racial discrimination and apartheid. Many \r\npeople around the world exercised their right to self-\r\ndetermination and took charge of their own fates by \r\nestablishing and building independent States of their \r\nown, thus increasing the number of United Nations \r\nStates Members from 51 to today’s 193.\r\nAmid all those achievements, we recognize that \r\nthe world currently faces new challenges, such as \r\nterrorism, extremism, intolerance, economic crises, \r\nclimate change, human trafficking, organ trafficking \r\nand trafficking in drugs and arms, a migration crisis \r\nand others. The list of those challenges is long. The \r\nprofound need to struggle against them obliges us to \r\nresolutely reiterate our joint commitment to the mission \r\nof the Organization and the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nLast year, on the eve of the centennial of the Armenian \r\ngenocide, I expressed from this rostrum our gratitude to \r\nthe nations that had recognized the Armenian genocide, \r\nand I named each State individually (see A/69/PV.6). I \r\ncalled upon the international community to strengthen \r\nthe struggle against the recurrence of the crime of \r\ngenocide recognizing and condemning its occurrence. \r\nToday, from this same rostrum, I would like to thank \r\nPope Francis and to acknowledge the historic mass he \r\nserved. I also wish to thank the European Parliament \r\nand to recall the resolution it adopted. In addition, the \r\nwell-known statement by the German President will, \r\nbelieve me, henceforth be found in the annals of our \r\nnation’s history.\r\nIn that connection, I thank the legislative bodies \r\nof Austria, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Luxembourg and the \r\nNetherlands, as well as numerous provincial and city \r\ncouncils and hundreds of political and non-governmental \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.17\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n17th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 29 September 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\norganizations. I also thank the Presidents of Russia, \r\nFrance, Cyprus and Serbia, as well as the delegations \r\nof numerous other countries that came on 24 April to \r\npay tribute to the victims of the Armenian genocide \r\nin Yerevan. Our determination to keep the prevention \r\nof the crime of genocide on the international agenda \r\nis demonstrated by the resolutions that we periodically \r\nsubmit to the Human Rights Council. The latest \r\nresolution to that effect was adopted this year. Building \r\nfurther upon that, just a few days ago, the Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 69/323, establishing 9 December as \r\nthe International Day of Commemoration and Dignity \r\nof the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the \r\nPrevention of This Crime.\r\nThe peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nproblem remains one of the most salient issues in our \r\nregion. I must note that the aggressive policy pursued \r\nby Azerbaijan has resulted in the absence of any \r\nmeaningful progress in the negotiations to reach a \r\nsettlement of the conflict, and the situation has drifted \r\ntowards increasing tension. The dictatorial regime \r\nof that country has used disgraceful repression as an \r\ninstrument to strangle the people’s wrath, as the oil-\r\nbased economy obviously falters. Even that policy it \r\nnow considers to be ineffective. Now it requires images \r\nfrom the line of contact in order to divert the attention \r\nof its own public. I would like to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the fact that Azerbaijan, besides various \r\nother provocative actions, has now started to use heavy \r\nartillery, firing at the peaceful settlements of the \r\nbordering districts of both the Republic of Armenia and \r\nthe Nagorno Karabakh Republic.\r\nJust a few days ago, in the border area of Armenia, \r\nthree women fell victim to an Azerbaijani bombardment \r\nin their houses and in their gardens, where they were \r\npeacefully working. The question that comes to mind is \r\nwhether any reasonable person can see any valid logic \r\nin that cruelty. It is obvious to us that the Azerbaijani \r\nleadership has irreversibly lost both its sense of reality \r\nand its willingness to abide by the norms of human \r\nconduct.\r\nAzerbaijan completely disdains the five joint \r\nstatements issued by the Presidents of the United States \r\nof America, Russia and France, as well as the efforts \r\nof the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope Minsk Group. If that country continues its \r\naggressive policy, Armenia will have no other choice \r\nbut to take the necessary legal, political and military \r\nsteps to allow the Republic of Armenia and the Republic \r\nof Nagorno Karabakh to develop in security and peace.\r\nAlthough it is obvious to everybody which party \r\nhas instigated and continues to instigate the ceasefire \r\nviolations, I would still like to recall some facts. Is it not \r\nstrange that, for years now, Azerbaijan has stubbornly \r\nrefused to withdraw its snipers and establish an incident \r\ninvestigation mechanism, as proposed by the co-Chairs \r\nof the Minsk Group? The question that arises is, what is \r\nAzerbaijan afraid of?\r\nIs it not strange that, during the European Games \r\nhosted by Azerbaijan, when the Government needed \r\nan image of stability, almost no shooting incidents \r\noccurred at the border, while immediately after those \r\nGames shooting incidents reoccurred on a prolonged \r\nbasis? I do not expect members of the Assembly to buy \r\nthe assertions of any one of the parties, but I still hope \r\nthat everyone will exercise common sense. Is it not \r\nstrange that in the twenty-first century our neighbour, \r\nday in and day out, relentlessly and indefatigably \r\ntakes pride in its excessive accumulation of arms \r\nand the manifold expansion of its military budget? It \r\nstubbornly continues making bellicose threats that it \r\nintends to renew military hostilities, and that is done at \r\nthe highest level, that of the head of State.\r\nI think that everyone now understands why \r\nArmenia has consistently urged the international \r\ncommunity to make statements that are not general, but \r\nunambiguous, with regard to the party to whom they are \r\nreferring during discussions of the ceasefire violations. \r\nWe must understand that to stif le early-warning signals \r\nwith regard to threats to peace and security can have \r\ncatastrophic repercussions.\r\nToday, we are witnessing unspeakable barbarity \r\ntaking place in the Middle East. Religious intolerance \r\nhas brought irreversible consequences in its wake. \r\nWe have been most directly affected by the atrocities \r\nunfolding there, since they have led to the destruction \r\nof parts of Armenia’s spiritual and cultural heritage \r\nand its artefacts and to the murder and expulsion of \r\nnumerous Armenians residing in Iraq and Syria. The \r\nArmenian community of Syria, with its centuries-long \r\nhistory, shares and experiences all the hardships that \r\nthe Syrian people are undergoing in these difficult \r\ntimes. We are trying to aid the refuges to the best of \r\nour abilities. Up to now, Armenia has hosted more than \r\n16,000 refugees from Syria. That figure shows that \r\nArmenia is one of the leading host countries, together \r\nwith the European host countries.\r\n15-29437 3/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nArmenians are well acquainted with the fate of \r\nrefugees, of the exiled and expelled. The Armenian \r\ngenocide would have claimed many more lives and \r\nthe survivors would have gone through much greater \r\nhardship if a number of nations, our friends, had not \r\nlent us a helping hand in those difficult times. Today \r\nit is Germany, Sweden and a few other countries \r\nthat deserve praise for the humanism that they have \r\ndisplayed. They have provided hundreds of thousands \r\nof refugees with safe haven, and have reiterated that \r\nthat assistance was the right thing to do from both the \r\nlegal and the humanist perspectives.\r\nThis year, we all witnessed how joint and adequate \r\nactions paved the way to mitigating a difficult \r\ninternational issue. A historic agreement was reached \r\non the nuclear programme of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, an immediate neighbour of ours. That critical deal \r\nwill undoubtedly contribute to the global settlement \r\nof conflict situations and the strengthening of mutual \r\ntrust. Extended and consistent political and diplomatic \r\nefforts made the agreement possible.\r\nAll that proves that, when there is a political \r\nwill to bridge disagreements and embrace a spirit of \r\ncooperation, solutions can indeed be found to the \r\nmost complicated issues. From this rostrum, I would \r\nlike once again to stress the importance of using \r\ndiplomacy, especially to do away with closed borders. \r\nOur neighbours have subjected Armenia to an illegal \r\nblockade, and we deem such an improvident policy \r\nto be unacceptable, a policy that in the twenty-first \r\ncentury establishes artificial obstacles that disrupt \r\nintercultural, human-to-human and trade contacts. \r\nIn that context, we highly value the periodic reviews \r\ncarried out under the framework of the United Nations \r\nConferences on Landlocked Developing Countries. We \r\nstand ready to invest further efforts in that endeavour, \r\nincluding by hosting intermediate workshops on that \r\ntopic in our country.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to join all speakers \r\nwho have called for joint efforts to combat darkness, \r\natrocities and hatred. No country is too great or too \r\nsmall for that cause. Every single one has a role to play. \r\nArmenia stands ready to make its contribution to that \r\njoint struggle.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Armenia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Serzh Sargsyan, President of the Republic of \r\nArmenia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania.\r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of \r\nthe United Republic of Tanzania, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Kikwete: I join those who have spoken before \r\nme in congratulating you, Mr. President, on your well-\r\ndeserved election to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its seventieth session. Your election is a fitting tribute \r\nto your distinguished political career, having served as \r\nForeign Minister and Finance Minister of your country, \r\nand recently as Speaker of the Danish Parliament. It is \r\nalso a reflection of the high regard that the Assembly \r\nhas for your great country, Denmark. I would like to \r\nassure you of my country’s full support and cooperation \r\nin discharging your duties and responsibilities.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, for the outstanding manner in \r\nwhich he steered the affairs of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. Indeed, that great son of the African soil \r\nhas done us proud.\r\nI also wish to express a well-deserved word of \r\nappreciation for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nand his staff for their dedicated service and efforts \r\nin promoting the ideals and principles of the United \r\nNations. I also commend you, Mr. President, and \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session, as well as the Secretary-General, for \r\nthe excellent work culminating in the adoption of \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda (resolution 70/1) \r\nand the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nwith their 169 targets. We sincerely hope that reliable \r\nmechanisms will ensure the availability of the means of \r\nimplementation and follow-up. It was the failure to have \r\n4/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nsuch mechanisms that was responsible for the shortfalls \r\nin the implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the theme of this session, \r\n“The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for peace, \r\nsecurity and human rights”. The United Nations at 70 \r\nnot only has withstood the test of time, but has evolved \r\nand become a strong Organization. I am glad we all \r\nagree that much has been achieved in the past seven \r\ndecades. Equally, we agree that not everything that the \r\nfounding fathers envisaged the United Nations could \r\ndo has been done satisfactorily. The United Nations \r\nhas succeeded in preventing another world war, but \r\nthe challenges of preserving world peace and security \r\nremain. Inter- and intra-State conflicts and wars are \r\nmany and on the increase. Terrorism has become a \r\nserious global threat. There are still too many people \r\nwho live in conditions of abject poverty, squalor and \r\ndeprivation in a world of unprecedented wealth.\r\nUnlike 70 years ago, today there is better \r\nunderstanding, cooperation and partnership among \r\ncountries and organizations in preserving peace and \r\nsecurity. It is easier today for the world to come together \r\nto promote peace than it was before. As a matter of fact, \r\nmost of the conflicts we are witnessing today are being \r\nhandled, first and foremost, by regional and subregional \r\norganizations. The United Nations therefore must seek \r\nto forge strategic partnerships with such organizations. \r\nBy taking advantage of the knowledge they have of \r\nthe history and nature of the crises, key players and \r\ncultures of the people involved, it would be more \r\nsuccessful in managing and resolving conflicts. Where \r\nand when appropriate, the United Nations should invest \r\nin strengthening the capacity of those organizations \r\nand their member States in anticipating, detecting, \r\npreventing, managing and resolving conflicts. I am of \r\nthe view that such capacity is urgently needed in Africa.\r\nWe highly commend the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session and the Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on reform of the \r\nSecurity Council for their efforts. It is the wish of the \r\nmajority of Member States to see an acceleration of the \r\nnegotiation process during the current session. For the \r\nSecurity Council to remain what it was 70 years ago is \r\nincomprehensible and, to say the least, unacceptable. \r\nIt is high time that the demands of the majority of \r\nthe Member States be heard and heeded. We must be \r\nmindful of the fact that the credibility of the United \r\nNations depends upon a more agile, representative \r\nand responsive Security Council. Let us all muster \r\nthe courage and political will to accomplish that \r\nlong-overdue task for the sake of the Organization. \r\nIn the meantime, we must continue to support the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nPeacekeeping operations remain one of the most \r\ndependable instruments for promoting world peace and \r\nsecurity. I believe that they will remain so for many \r\nyears to come. I am told that there are approximately \r\n125,000 men and women deployed in 16 peacekeeping \r\nmissions across the world. Tanzania is proud to have \r\ncontributed 1,322 of those gallant people, who often \r\nserve under challenging conditions. Sometimes they \r\nare compelled to serve in places where there is little or \r\nno peace to keep. Tanzania stands ready to contribute \r\nmore, whenever and wherever requested to do so.\r\nWe cannot talk about the security challenges of \r\ntoday without mentioning terrorism — a security \r\nchallenge about which the United Nations and the \r\nentire international community must remain vigilant \r\nin the coming decade. While reiterating our strongest \r\ncondemnation of terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations, we believe that there is an urgent \r\nneed to bolster efforts at all levels for fighting that \r\nscourge. Collectively, we must aspire to improve our \r\npreparedness, collaboration and response to the threat \r\nwe face.\r\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa in the past year \r\nis a stark reminder of how dangerous epidemics can be \r\nand how vulnerable we are as nations and peoples. More \r\nthan 11,000 people lost their lives, including citizens \r\nof the United States and Spain, and approximately \r\n28,000 were infected. The economies of Liberia, \r\nGuinea and Sierra Leone were devastated. Economic \r\nactivities and services almost ground to a halt, thereby \r\ncausing enormous losses to the economies of the three \r\ncountries. The World Bank estimates that they lost \r\nabout $2.2 billion in gross domestic product as a result. \r\nApproximately 7,000 children lost their parents, and \r\nhalf a million people became food-insecure. More than \r\n5 million children lost valuable schooling and skills-\r\ndevelopment time. Mammoth recovery efforts are \r\nrequired to get those economies and societies back to \r\nwhere they were before the outbreak. Unfortunately, \r\nmany countries in Africa also suffered, irrespective \r\nof how distant those countries were from the three \r\nprimarily affected countries. The tourism industry is a \r\ncase in point: it is suffering throughout Africa.\r\n15-29437 5/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nThe biggest lesson from the handling of the Ebola \r\noutbreak in West Africa is that the world needs to be \r\nbetter prepared to prevent and respond to epidemics in \r\nfuture. That was not the case for the Ebola outbreak \r\nin West Africa. In that regard, we should all commend \r\nthe Secretary-General for his wise decision to establish \r\nthe High-level Panel on the Global Response to Health \r\nCrises to make recommendations on how the world \r\ncan better respond to public-health emergencies of \r\nglobal concern in the future. I was given the honour \r\nof chairing the Panel. It is premature for me to report \r\nanything substantive now to the General Assembly. \r\nWe will complete our work in December, and I am \r\nsure our report will be brought before the Assembly \r\nfor information and action. We look forward to the \r\nAssembly’s support.\r\nTanzania welcomes the historic and momentous \r\ndecision taken by the United States of America and the \r\nRepublic of Cuba to restore diplomatic relations and \r\nreopen embassies in Washington, D.C., and Havana. \r\nWe join the people of Cuba and the people of the United \r\nStates in celebrating that landmark achievement. We \r\ncommend President Barack Obama and President Raúl \r\nCastro Ruz for their bold and courageous leadership. \r\nThe two leaders and countries have proved to all of us \r\nthe power of dialogue in finding solutions even when \r\nthe differences are deep-rooted and the conflicts long-\r\nstanding. We extend best wishes to our United States \r\nand Cuban friends as they open a new chapter in their \r\nbilateral relations. We hope that the United States will \r\nlift the remaining economic sanctions and appeal to it \r\nto do so. The sanctions have condemned the people of \r\nCuba to untold socioeconomic hardships, poverty and \r\nmisery for the past 50 years.\r\nIn the same vein, it is our wish that Israel and \r\nPalestine would resume dialogue so that their long-\r\nstanding conflict can be resolved peacefully. It is \r\nhigh time that the pain and suffering endured by the \r\npeople of Palestine over many decades be brought to \r\nan end. It is about time that the people of Israel lived \r\npeacefully and harmoniously with their neighbours. It \r\nis regrettable that, as we celebrate 70 years since the \r\nfounding of the United Nations, the conflict remains \r\nunresolved. Tanzania subscribes to and supports \r\nthe two-State solution, with the State of Israel and a \r\nsovereign, contiguous and viable State of Palestine \r\nliving side by side in peace, security, harmony, mutual \r\nrecognition, trust and cooperation. We believe it is \r\npossible and achievable. All that is required of us is to \r\nredouble our efforts.\r\nAnother outstanding issue for the Organization \r\nis that of Western Sahara, a matter that must not be \r\nleft unresolved. The lack of action on the part of the \r\nUnited Nations to implement its decisions in the matter \r\nis both regrettable and incomprehensible. The people of \r\nSaharawi have waited far too long for an opportunity to \r\ndetermine their fate and future. Let this Organization \r\nmuster the political will and pluck up the courage to do \r\nwhat it decided long ago to do. At 70, the United Nations \r\nis old enough and has accumulated enough wisdom and \r\nexperience to put this matter to rest. Please, let us do it.\r\nOn 20 September 2006 I stood at this rostrum \r\n(see A/61/PV.13) for the first time and addressed the \r\nGeneral Assembly as the newly elected fourth President \r\nof my dear country, the United Republic of Tanzania. \r\nToday I stand here to bid farewell, as I prepare to leave \r\noffice upon the completion of my two-term mandate, \r\nin accordance with the Tanzanian Constitution. I thank \r\nall my colleagues in the Assembly for the invaluable \r\nsupport and cooperation they have extended to me, my \r\nAdministration and my country over the past 10 years \r\nof our work together. Kindly be assured that I will \r\nalways value each and every contribution. I feel proud \r\nto have had the opportunity to work with all Member \r\nStates to promote the ideals of the United Nations and \r\nto contribute to the pursuit of world peace, security, \r\nstability and development.\r\nAs I take my leave, I would like to assure the \r\nAssembly that Tanzania will remain a faithful Member \r\nand an unwavering supporter of the United Nations. I \r\nam confident that Members will find in my successor \r\na likeable and dependable friend and ally. Please \r\naccord him or her — I should add that we have a \r\nfemale candidate for the presidency of Tanzania — the \r\nnecessary support and cooperation in fulfilling his or \r\nher duties and responsibilities.\r\nThe road ahead for peace, security and development \r\nremains challenging but worth the journey. It requires \r\nour renewed resolve and the reaffirmation of our \r\ncommitment to the ideals, values and principles set down \r\nby the founding fathers of the United Nations seven \r\ndecades ago in San Francisco. All nations, individually \r\nand collectively, should endeavour to promote them, as \r\nwe have been doing for the past 70 years. It can be done. \r\nThe international community must play its part.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United Republic of \r\nTanzania for the statement he has just made.\r\n6/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President \r\nof the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Maduro Moros (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nare assembled here in 2015, once again fully aware of \r\nthe immense struggle of our peoples to arrive at an age \r\nof dignity, a time when there will finally be a world \r\nthat respects the distinct identities of all our peoples, \r\nThis year, Venezuela celebrates the 200th anniversary \r\nof a prophetic document written by our liberator, Simón \r\nBolívar. I am speaking of the letter that he wrote 200 \r\nyears ago in Kingston, Jamaica, a beautiful island of \r\nthe Caribbean, at the exact moment when the liberation \r\nforces began their ascent from the depths of history \r\nafter hundreds of years of colonial domination of our \r\nlands — today Latin America and the Caribbean. The \r\npurpose of that letter was to define the nature of their \r\nstruggles and outline the path they needed to follow. In \r\nit, Simón Bolívar defined the elements of a geopolitical \r\nvision for the Americas — a non-imperialist, \r\nnon-colonialist geopolitical vision that, in twenty-\r\nfirst century terms, we might call anti-imperialist and \r\nanti-colonialist. Two hundred years ago, he set down the \r\nconceptual lines of the geopolitical thesis we continue \r\nto support today to address the need to establish a \r\nbalanced universe and a world with justice and peace \r\nfor all. For 200 years we have drawn inspiration from \r\nthat prophetic letter. And, only a few days ago, here \r\nin our common home of humankind, Pope Francis \r\nrenewed Simón Bolívar’s message (see A/70/PV.3), \r\nsaying that we need a new form of geopolitics, a new \r\napproach, a new world, a geopolitical vision based on \r\nrespect for the different peoples of the world and for \r\ntheir different identities and models; in other words, \r\na policy of coexistence and of peace with justice and \r\nequality. He called for a political approach that rejects \r\nthe imposition of all forms of hegemony, whether \r\nthrough the threat or use of force, and all attempts at \r\nfinancial, economic, cultural, military and political \r\nhegemony.\r\nThis year we also celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations. \r\nThose 70 years have sped by, like a fast-forwarded \r\nmovie, while we undertook the most important search in \r\nhuman history, namely, the search for ways to settle our \r\ndifferences and to build a world that fulfils everyone’s \r\nhopes, a world without exclusion or discrimination. \r\nHumankind has been able to celebrate some successes \r\nin those 70 years.\r\nIn 1945, the Charter of the United Nations was \r\nwritten in the aftermath of the Second World War. While \r\nthe tragedy that destroyed half of the planet and took \r\nmillions of innocent lives was still fresh in everyone’s \r\nmind, humankind came together to write that Charter \r\nand, with it, to spell out its dreams. For 70 years, the \r\nPreamble of the Charter has continued to announce \r\nemphatically that we the peoples of the United Nations \r\nare determined to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war. Today, in 2015, we the peoples of the \r\nworld announce that we are ready to save humankind \r\nfrom the scourges of inequality, poverty, looting and \r\nexploitation, which are the true causes of all the wars \r\nthat we have known.\r\nDuring those 70 years, we witnessed the birth \r\nof a dyadic world — aptly named because of the two \r\nfactions involved — that, in the form of the Cold War \r\nand the resulting real and painful wars, left their mark \r\non the second half of the 1940s and the 1950s, 1960s \r\nand 1970s. Later, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, \r\nwe saw the emergence of a menacing monadic world \r\nthat claimed that it had a panacea that could cure all our \r\nills and rid us of false ideologies. In the 1990s, in that \r\nworld, one way of thinking and one economic model \r\nwere imposed on us. That was the era of neoliberalism, \r\nan era that sowed poverty and extreme need, owing to \r\nthe privatization of the natural resources and economies \r\nof peoples of the South. In general, it sowed misery, \r\nsickness and unemployment throughout the world.\r\nA dyadic world characterized by confrontation was \r\nsucceeded by a monadic world, in which an intolerable \r\nsituation was inflicted upon us. The dawn of the \r\ntwenty-first century, thanks to God and thanks to the \r\nwork of the people, saw the rise of a revolutionary elan \r\nin the Venezuelan people, who have, in turn, inspired \r\n15-29437 7/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nthe constructive revolution of the peoples of the South, \r\nin Latin America and in the Caribbean.\r\nIn this new century, the time has finally come to \r\nbuild a multipolar world — a multi-centred world; a \r\nworld without hegemony; a world of equals; a world in \r\nwhich the other’s points of view are respected; a world \r\nthat acknowledges the weight that should be given to \r\nemerging centres of political, economic and cultural \r\npower; a world that recognizes the new regionalisms \r\nthat are gaining in strength in the various parts of the \r\nworld; a world that ushers in a new era and recognizes \r\nthe values set down in the inspiring words of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations by ensuring that the rights to \r\nhuman dignity, self-determination, independence and \r\nlife are realized for all peoples.\r\nThis multipolar and multi-centred world encompasses \r\nmajor themes. In this Hall, we have listened to the \r\nspeeches made from this rostrum. Yesterday, we heard \r\nthe speeches of President Dilma Rousseff, from our \r\nbrother country, Brazil, and President Barack Obama of \r\nthe United States of America. We saw President Vladimir \r\nPutin shine as one of the most important leaders in \r\nthe world today. We saw Presidents Xi Jinping, Raúl \r\nCastro, Evo Morales Ayma, Rafael Correa, Cristina \r\nFernández. We have followed attentively the discussion \r\nof the topics that are the subject of this debate. We \r\nhave listened to what was said on the issues of war and \r\npeace. I believe that today no one in this Hall, or in any \r\nother forum, could offer a single word in defence of the \r\nunjust wars that have destroyed our brother peoples in \r\nAfrica, Asia and the Middle East.\r\nToday, taking inspiration from the rebelling and \r\nclarion voice of the people of Venezuela, we need to \r\nacknowledge the tragic errors that were committed \r\nwhen our brother nations were invaded, bombed and \r\nwaged war on. Today, we should acknowledge that the \r\nfour wars that the world has seen during the past decade \r\nand a half have caused major systems within the United \r\nNations to fail. With regard to the war in Afghanistan, \r\nwe should ask ourselves and our brothers, the people of \r\nAfghanistan: did it bring peace? Did it bring stability? \r\nDid it bring life to the people of Afghanistan? Or did it \r\nbring more misery, destruction and terrorism? The war \r\nin Iraq was inspired by manipulation and lies and had \r\nonly one goal: to conquer Iraq. It had only one objective: \r\nto take Iraq’s oil and natural riches. Twelve years later, \r\ncan we say that Iraq is a more united, more peace-filled \r\nor more stable country? We should say to those who \r\nstaged the war in Iraq that once again, through war, \r\nthey have failed and caused international politics to \r\nfail. And Libya? The words that Commandant Hugo \r\nChávez Frías pronounced in this very Hall are fresh \r\nin our memory. He warned of the lies used to justify \r\nthe bombing and conquest of Libya. Whatever political \r\ndifferences one country may have with another’s \r\nleadership or Government, it is not entitled, under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations or pursuant to any other \r\nmandate, to challenge or judge the political authority \r\nof that leadership or to overthrow that Government. No \r\none is authorized to do that.\r\nAll this is distressing for us. We love the Arab \r\npeoples. We admire their ancient culture. We admire \r\nthe Muslim peoples. Today, it pains me to say what I \r\nthink is universally acknowledged, that what happened \r\nin Libya was a crime. A stable country, which, in its \r\nturn, sustained the stability of a score of other North \r\nAfrican and African countries, was destroyed. Libya \r\nwas the founder of the African Union, but what is Libya \r\nnow? The people of Venezuela are asking if Libya is \r\na more stable country economically and socially? Is \r\nit a united country? Is it a country? Is it a country at \r\npeace? And who will pay for the crimes in Libya, Iraq \r\nand Afghanistan? Who will acknowledge them? And \r\nwhat will happen to Syria? The situation there brings \r\nto mind one of those horror films made in Hollywood. \r\nThe horror in Syria is created by the politics of terror \r\nand the terror of war.\r\nWith all due modesty and humility, we in Venezuela \r\nbelieve that the United Nations system still has time to \r\nprevent a worse tragedy in Syria, a tragedy of even more \r\nterrifying and shocking proportions than those that \r\nbefell Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Humankind still \r\nhas time to create a new alliance of peace. We support \r\nthe proposal put forth by the President of the Russian \r\nFederation, Mr. Vladimir Putin, on the creation of a \r\nnew alliance of peace. Venezuela, as a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, will submit another \r\nproposal with a view to protecting the people of Syria \r\nand putting up a real fight against the groups that, \r\ninstigated and financed by the West, have been sowing \r\nterror, death and destruction. Humankind must lend its \r\nsupport and assistance to Syria for the salvation of the \r\nsurrounding region.\r\nOur fellow citizens in Europe would be wrong to \r\nbelieve that they can escape the consequences of the \r\nhumanitarian tragedy in Syria, or to think that mass \r\nexoduses of Syrians will not reach their shores and lands, \r\nexerting an impact on the entire European civilization. \r\n8/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nThe United Nations must wake up and react to the \r\ntragedy in Syria. We must learn from the resounding \r\nand tragic failure of the four wars I just mentioned and \r\ninitiate, in the Security Council and the United Nations \r\nsystem, the establishment of a new regulatory system \r\nprohibiting the use of interventionist methods to cause \r\nwar, spread terror and bring destruction and death to \r\npeoples declared undesirable or unfriendly by world \r\nelites.\r\nWe must overcome huge challenges in order to \r\nachieve peace. I believe that on this there is general \r\nconsensus, because we have heard even President \r\nObama say that there is no development without peace. \r\nWe have heard that the philosophy of peace has been \r\ngaining ground among major world leaders. Only \r\npeace can guarantee the viability of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), a noble \r\nplan for making progress towards achieving equality \r\nand overcoming poverty. Only peace can guarantee the \r\nviability of development in international relations on \r\nour planet. There are therefore huge challenges facing \r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nA new regionalist approach is being developed in \r\nLatin America. This is good news for our Latin American \r\nand Caribbean region. In recent years, Latin America \r\nhas rediscovered the path to unity and independence, \r\nto unity in diversity and to a common search. Today, in \r\n2015, we can justifiably say here at the United Nations \r\nthat Latin America has been consolidating the strength \r\nof its new communities. At their historic Summit in \r\nHavana, the Latin American and Caribbean States \r\ndeclared Latin America a zone of peace. The path of our \r\nregion is heading in that direction. Subregional bodies, \r\nsuch as Petrocaribe and the Bolivarian Alliance for \r\nthe Peoples of Our America, and powerful subregional \r\nbodies that operate collectively, such as the Union of \r\nSouth American Nations (UNASUR), have created \r\na new reality on our continent. We still have one \r\narmed conflict to settle: the 60-year-old internal war \r\nand conflict in Colombia. On behalf of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, we congratulate Colombia on \r\nthe welcome steps taken by President Juan Manuel \r\nSantos Calderón in order to make progress towards \r\na conclusive peace agreement with the guerrillas of \r\nthe Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia. \r\nVenezuela is betting heavily on the strengthening of \r\nthe path of peace in Colombia — that Colombia which \r\nwas the beautiful dream of our Liberator and the fine \r\ncreation of our liberators.\r\nIn addition, Latin America is speaking with \r\none voice. We will demonstrate this once again on \r\n28 October. President Raúl Castro Ruz and our comrade \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla have announced that \r\nthe issue of the embargo of the United States against \r\nCuba will be discussed by the General Assembly on \r\n28 October. We acknowledge the steps taken in 2015 \r\nfor the normalization and regularization of relations, \r\nbased on respect between the Government of President \r\nBarack Obama and the Government of President Raúl \r\nCastro Ruz, between the United States of America and \r\nCuba.\r\nWe say to the United States Government that \r\nwe look forward to the day when the relations of \r\nits Government with all the Governments of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean enjoy the same treatment \r\nin terms of dialogue, respect and recognition as Cuba \r\nreceives today. We are waiting for the United States \r\nto turn the page on a history of interventionism and \r\ncoups d’état, and of attempts to disrupt revolutionary \r\nprocesses, as occurred in Venezuela and with the long \r\nhostility towards Cuba, which lasted for 56 years and \r\nconsisted of the embargo and economic and financial \r\npersecution. That history must not be repeated. The \r\nfinancial and economic blockade and the persecution \r\nsuffered by Cuba must end as soon as possible.\r\nJust as President Jimmy Carter in 1979 signed the \r\nagreement to return the sovereignty of the Panama \r\nCanal to the Panamanians, we hope that soon the \r\nUnited States will return the Guantanamo Base and \r\nterritory to the Cuban people, who have historically \r\nbeen its owners.\r\nThe good news is possible only because of the \r\nperseverance of the Cuban people and their proud and \r\nrebellious spirit, which, like the beauty of Cuba, has \r\nremained resilient throughout all these years of struggle. \r\nIt has also been possible, we must admit, because of the \r\ncourage of President Barack Obama in assuming a new \r\npolicy towards Cuba.\r\nIn the same spirit, we support and echo the appeal \r\nof the Latin American and Caribbean nations to the \r\nGovernment of the United Kingdom to decide sooner \r\nrather than later that it will sit down and negotiate, in \r\naccordance with international law and via peaceful \r\ndiplomacy and understanding, the right of Argentina to \r\nthe Malvinas Islands, South Sandwich and the rest of the \r\nsurrounding islands that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, \r\nhistorically belong to Argentina. It is an appeal made \r\n15-29437 9/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nby the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates (CELAC), the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, and all who support peaceful \r\ndiplomacy, dialogue and communication. It is an appeal \r\nthat must be answered.\r\nVenezuela has been facing significant challenges \r\nin recent years in its endeavour to create an eminently \r\nVenezuelan social, economic and political model, \r\nan endeavour inspired by the doctrine of Liberator \r\nSimón Bolívar. It has chosen the human option in the \r\nbattle that our brother President Evo Morales Ayma \r\nreferred to yesterday (see A/70/PV.15) and the option \r\nthat Pope Francis described as eminently humanistic \r\n(see A/70/PV.3). Venezuela has opted to build a new \r\nsociety — the socialist society. It is a twenty-first- \r\ncentury socialist revolution that joins such other \r\nrevolutions of independence in Latin America as those \r\nin Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua. Venezuela is on \r\nthe same path as the historic Cuban revolution and is \r\nfollowing the example of Commander Fidel Castro \r\nRuz, President Raúl Castro Ruz and the Cuban people.\r\nOur people have waged a great battle while facing \r\ndomestic and foreign conspiracies. Recently, we had to \r\ndeal with major conspiracies and grave attacks. Earlier \r\nthis year, we had to have a public debate on a threatening \r\nexecutive order issued, on 9 March, by President Barack \r\nObama, which declared Venezuela an unusual and \r\nextraordinary threat to the people of the United States. \r\nI think that the debate at the Summit of the Americas in \r\nPanama in April accurately clarified the real meaning \r\nof the thinking underlying the order. The statement of \r\nPresident Obama recognizing that Venezuela was a \r\ncountry of peace and is not and never has been a threat \r\nto the United States is a very positive step. However, \r\nI must say, as Head of State and Government, it is not \r\nenough. The order issued on 9 March must be repealed \r\nand annulled, because it is a threat to my homeland and \r\nmy country. We have initiated talks with the Government \r\nof the United States, in the same spirit in which Cuba \r\ninitiated a respectful dialogue and communication, so \r\nthat sooner rather than later we can remove the sword of \r\nDamocles — the order of 9 March — that hangs above \r\nthe heads of the Venezuelan people.\r\nThis year also, as we reported nationally and \r\ninternationally, Venezuela had to use peaceful \r\ndiplomacy to lift the threat of conflicts along our \r\nborder. I reported, and I do so respectfully now in \r\nthe General Assembly, a pincer operation aimed at \r\ncausing conflicts along the borders with Colombia and \r\nwith our sister Republic of Guyana. A week ago, we \r\nwere in Quito, summoned by CELAC and UNASUR, \r\nand together with President Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, we were able to define a way of clearing the \r\nprovocations, threats and attacks by paramilitaries and \r\ndrug traffickers against Venezuela. That is being done, \r\nand I am now able to say that I have strong hopes that \r\nwe will be able to complete the process and then restore \r\nnormal working relations and communications with the \r\nGovernment of Colombia.\r\nSimilarly, with the new Government of Guyana, \r\nthere were a number of issues that needed to be \r\nresolved within the regional framework. I want to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for answering the call \r\nof Venezuela and convening a meeting on Sunday, \r\n27 September, the day of the blood moon and the \r\neclipse. While the blood moon was rising, we met with \r\nthe President of Guyana, Mr. David Granger. Again, I \r\nam glad to say that peaceful diplomacy prevailed and \r\nallowed us to successfully take steps in connection with \r\na historical claim that Venezuela has had since 1835.\r\nThe Bolivarian Revolution of Venezuela therefore \r\nwill continue to address the threats and difficult \r\ncircumstances with Bolivarian peaceful diplomacy, a \r\ndiplomacy that enables us, by means of dialogue and \r\ncommunication, to resolve the various threats to and \r\nproblems of the Venezuelan people.\r\nVenezuela is shortly to hold parliamentary \r\nelections — the twentieth in 15 years of revolution. In \r\nthe previous elections, the revolutionary, independent \r\nand Bolivarian forces, inspired by our Commander \r\nChávez, won 18 of the victories. We are heading into \r\nthe parliamentary elections. Everything is prepared \r\nonce again. Former United States President Jimmy \r\nCarter once said that the Venezuelan electoral system \r\nwas the most transparent and comprehensive electoral \r\nsystem he had ever seen. It will enable our people to \r\nexpress their will in the elections on 6 December.\r\nMr. Alyemany (Yemen), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nI urge the world to be very attentive to any attempt \r\nto interfere with the political process in Venezuela. \r\nVenezuela is willing to continue its course along the \r\nactive and participatory democratic path. It is the path \r\nprescribed by our Constitution and adopted by our \r\npeople in 1999. It is a path of peace. The Bolivarian \r\npeople have an eminently democratic, popular \r\nand peaceful nature. Therefore, this year we will \r\n10/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nundoubtedly continue to demonstrate and strengthen \r\nthe independence and dignity that characterize the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nTwo hundred years after the prophetic letter in \r\nKingston was written, we wish here to say aloud, \r\nforcefully and with dignity, that we endorse the appeal \r\nfor a different United Nations and a radical reform of \r\nthe system created 70 years ago. We venture to say, \r\nas Bolívar did, that the world needs a new, balanced \r\nand respectful geopolitics that strengthens the new \r\nregionalism. Most of all, the world needs to listen to the \r\npeople. We very much hope that, in 15 years’ time, in \r\n2030, when the next cycle of the 2030 Agenda will be \r\ndrawing to an end — the Agenda to promote equality \r\nand life and to eliminate poverty — we will be able to \r\ncelebrate a new policy of peace, the rebuilding of the \r\ntowns that have been destroyed by the unfair imperialist \r\nwars, and a new regulatory system with which the \r\nUnited Nations can quell attempts to impose hegemony \r\nby those who think they have the right to rule other \r\npeoples. I very much hope that in 2030 we will be able \r\nto build and rebuild this marvellous institution that was \r\nborn 70 years ago with a dream of peace, which is our \r\ndream today. Long live peace!\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nicolás Maduro Moros, President of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Liberia.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Ellen \r\nJohnson-Sirleaf, President of the Republic of Liberia, \r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Johnson-Sirleaf: On this auspicious \r\noccasion, the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, I am honoured to address the Assembly on \r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Liberia. I \r\ncongratulate the President on his election to preside \r\nover the Assembly, and I appreciate the stewardship of \r\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, who \r\nably conducted the Assembly’s affairs at the sixty-ninth \r\nsession.\r\nThis year has registered ground-breaking \r\ndevelopments. After 50 years, the United States \r\nand Cuba have decided to resolve differences by \r\nestablishing diplomatic relations. Another milestone \r\nwas the adoption here, a few days ago, of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, “Transforming our world: the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” (resolution \r\n70/1), by which we committed to implementing \r\nmeasures to transform the lives of our peoples — to \r\nlift them from poverty to prosperity — and to preserve \r\nthe planet. It was this same vision that, 70 years ago, \r\nmotivated the founding of this global organization to \r\npromote peaceful coexistence, economic and social \r\nadvancement of all peoples, respect for human dignity, \r\nand equal rights of men and women and nations large \r\nand small. I am proud to say that Liberia was among the \r\nfounding Members of the United Nations.\r\nThe creation of the United Nations came out of a \r\nrealization that only a global organization, through the \r\nsupport and cooperation of the comity of nations, would \r\nbe suitable to grapple with the many challenges facing \r\nhumankind. Today, a reduction in inter-State conflict \r\nand cooperation in the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights and in alleviating global poverty, disease \r\nand hunger are the hallmarks of this body. On the other \r\nhand, increased intra-State conflicts and international \r\nterrorism are seeking to undermine the gains made \r\nin reducing human suffering. Protracted and intense \r\nconflicts in various parts of the world pose serious \r\nthreats to global peace and security.\r\nThus new and emerging challenges call the United \r\nNations to action. Despite commendable efforts, \r\nAfrica, the Middle East, Asia and Europe still have \r\nvortexes of conflict. Migrants and people seeking \r\nrefuge from conflicts and economic hardship are \r\nswirling across Europe. We are haunted by the growing \r\nthreats of destabilizing forces, such as Boko Haram \r\nand the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS), and \r\nby attempts to reverse democratic initiatives, such as \r\nthat in Burkina Faso, which invoked an immediate and \r\ndecisive response from the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States.\r\n15-29437 11/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nClimate conditions are changing, and so must \r\nwe. In many countries of the world, women are still \r\nbeing treated as second-class citizens. As Liberia \r\nbears painful witness, weak public-health systems in \r\nindividual countries threaten global health and well-\r\nbeing. It is not beyond this body to find answers and to \r\nrespond, and we know that we must. We feel compelled \r\nto ask if, at 70, our world Organization is hindered \r\ntoday by inflexible structures and overburdened by \r\nbureaucracies. Is the current structure of the United \r\nNations fit for purpose — to play its role in the global \r\ntransformation processes over the next 15 years? We \r\nare encouraged by the introspection that is taking place \r\nat the United Nations around these questions.\r\nWe commend the foresight of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in directing a comprehensive review of peace \r\noperations, which is complemented by a review of \r\nthe Organization’s peacebuilding architecture and a \r\nglobal study on the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000), on women’s participation \r\nin peace processes. After the completion of these \r\nreviews, we expect implementation to bring further \r\nimprovements. Liberia can attest, with gratitude, \r\nto the nature of United Nations peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding functions, which are critical and \r\nindispensable for post-conflict countries.\r\nThis year, we marked the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe historic Fourth World Conference on Women, held \r\nin Beijing, and its Platform for Action for women’s \r\nempowerment and gender equality. We are also marking \r\nthe fifteenth anniversary of resolution 1325 (2000), on \r\nwomen’s participation in peace processes. And while \r\nimprovements have been made in the status of women, \r\nmuch more remains to be done. We must therefore \r\nall step up and take further measures, going beyond \r\nmoralizing gender equality to tangible actions. In \r\n70 years only three women have served as President of \r\nthe General Assembly — one of them, many years ago, \r\nbeing our compatriot, Mrs. Angie Brooks Randolph. \r\nOnly a few women have served or are serving as special \r\nrepresentative of the Secretary-General, and not a \r\nsingle woman has ever served as Secretary-General.\r\nAs we ponder, in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, \r\nthe three countries worst hit by the deadly Ebola virus \r\ndisease, we bear witness to the foundational creed of \r\nthe United Nations that we can always find it within our \r\nhumanity to respond even to unknown enemies to our \r\ncollective progress. Accordingly, we remain grateful \r\nto the international community for the outpouring of \r\nsupport and assistance as we faced down the deadly \r\ndisease, the greatest modern threat to global public \r\nhealth. We thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho — in partnership with our countries and with \r\nsupport from the African Development Bank, the \r\nAfrican Union, the European Union and the World \r\nBank — hosted the International Ebola Recovery \r\nConference to focus attention on, and seek support for, \r\nour post-Ebola recovery programmes.\r\nThe Ebola scourge undoubtedly leaves indelible \r\nmarks of grief, sorrow and unimaginable aff liction. \r\nBut it has also caused us to celebrate heartwarming \r\ntales of extraordinary courage and leadership \r\nacross Governments and communities, as well as \r\nexceptional regional and international responses. \r\nWe are now proceeding with implementation of our \r\npost-Ebola economic stabilization and recovery plan, \r\nwith expectations of support from our bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners for a regionally approved post-\r\nEbola recovery strategy that the three Mano River \r\nUnion countries affected have formulated.\r\nWe are determined to address our development \r\nlosses, including by rebuilding better and more resilient \r\nhealth and education systems. The Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda, adopted in April, offers pathways to various \r\nforms of financing, capacity-building and technological \r\nexchange in support of our pursuit of our development \r\nobjectives. We must now forge genuine partnerships in \r\norder to move ahead on the road to strengthening peace \r\nand security, human rights, socioeconomic development \r\nand environmental sustainability. We stand firm in our \r\npolitical will to meet any challenge to our commitment \r\nto leaving no one behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Liberia for the statement she has just \r\nmade.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia.\r\n12/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Edgar \r\nChagwa Lungu, President of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Lungu: I would like to begin by thanking \r\nthe Secretary-General and by expressing my gratitude \r\nfor the convening of this important session, at which we \r\nmark the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. I am confident that, coming as he does from \r\nthe great country of Denmark, he will preside over \r\nour meetings with great success. I would also like to \r\npay tribute to His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda for successfully presiding over the \r\nAssembly at its previous session.\r\nI am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to \r\ndeliver my first address to this gathering of world \r\nleaders. I should recall that, almost a year ago, my \r\ncountry found itself at a crossroads following the \r\ndemise, on 28 October 2014, of our fifth President, \r\nMr. Michael Chilufya Sata — may his soul rest in peace. \r\nI was elected President of the Republic of Zambia in the \r\nsubsequent election, which took place on 20 January. \r\nBuilding on my country’s impeccable record in the \r\narea of democracy and good governance, the election \r\nwas described as transparent, peaceful, free and fair, \r\nref lecting our commitment to internationally accepted \r\nstandards for peaceful changes of Government and \r\npopular participation in shaping a country’s destiny. \r\nI would therefore like to thank the people of Zambia \r\nfor being true champions of democracy. As we meet \r\ntoday, I also feel duty bound to thank the international \r\ncommunity for its unflinching solidarity during that \r\nvery challenging time of the past year.\r\nThis year is an important one for the General \r\nAssembly, as we commemorate the 70 years of \r\nexistence of the United Nations. In our deliberations, \r\ntherefore, it is imperative that we take stock of the \r\ncollective successes as well as the challenges of the past \r\nseven decades, in order to improve the performance \r\nof this noble Organization. I am optimistic that the \r\nseventieth session will set a tone for the future and \r\nmeet the expectations of the international community \r\nas a whole. Zambia is proud to be part of the global \r\nendeavour to foster the mandate of the United Nations \r\nto promote peace, security and respect for human rights \r\nand to ensure progress in development for all. We are \r\nconcerned, however, that the gears for advancing the \r\nthree pillars of the Charter of the United Nations are \r\nmoving at a very slow pace, which has the potential to \r\nnegate the gains we have achieved so far. It is therefore \r\nimportant that we enhance our concerted efforts to \r\naddress areas of concern.\r\nWe have just adopted the world’s quintessential \r\ndevelopment blueprint in the form of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), centred \r\non humankind, the environment and the creation of \r\npeaceful societies. Those core elements will guide its \r\nimplementation, supported by the principle of leaving \r\nno one behind. I have been encouraged by the focus on \r\ndevelopment that has characterized the global discourse \r\nin recent years, as the 2030 Agenda has evolved. The \r\ndevelopment lessons of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and the cumulative experience of the 70 years of \r\nthe United Nations should serve as a springboard for \r\nour ambitions. Let us therefore ensure the successful \r\nimplementation and attainment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). I am confident that the \r\ninvaluable lessons learned will set us on a trajectory \r\nthat must inevitably lead to a safer, more inclusive, \r\ncleaner and more prosperous world.\r\nIn the 70 years of the existence of the United \r\nNations, the inequality gap among and between \r\nnations has continued to widen, as poverty and youth \r\nunemployment have threatened the prospects for \r\npeace, security and development. My Government \r\nlooks forward to the comprehensive implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich promotes poverty eradication and the creation \r\nof employment opportunities for young people and \r\nwomen, especially in rural communities.\r\nOver the past 70 years, the global community has \r\nbecome more united than ever before in its quest to \r\npush boundaries in order to attain peace and security; \r\nyet it is as divided as ever, if not more so, on the \r\nquestion of who makes decisions on global peace and \r\nsecurity. The 70 years of the existence of the United \r\nNations have seen more conflicts in Africa than on \r\nany other continent, and yet those 70 years have been \r\ncharacterized by Africa’s absolute exclusion from \r\ndecision-making in the Security Council, despite the \r\nfact that a significant part of the Council’s agenda \r\n15-29437 13/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nconcerns the African continent. In the 70 years of the \r\nexistence of the United Nations, Africa remains the \r\nonly continent not represented among the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. Goal 10 of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\non reducing inequality among countries will not be \r\nachieved without eradicating the inequality among \r\ncountries in the Security Council. The United Nations \r\nmust, therefore, redouble its efforts to implement \r\nSecurity Council reform in order to ensure that Africa \r\ncan take its rightful place among the community of \r\nnations and contributes equitably and effectively to \r\nglobal peace and security.\r\nZambia has continued and will continue to offer its \r\nresources for peacekeeping, including the deployment \r\nearlier this year of a large contingent of troops to \r\nthe Central African Republic. Zambia comes with a \r\nlong history of involvement in conflict prevention, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. As a landlocked \r\ncountry, our independence was incomplete as long \r\nas we remained surrounded by nations still fighting \r\ntheir liberation struggles. That gave impetus to our \r\nmoral conviction to join in the liberation struggles in \r\nAfrica. Since then, Zambia has continued to participate \r\nin peacebuilding initiatives and has supported \r\npeacekeeping efforts all around the world. We continue \r\nto share the global concerns at the unrelenting \r\nthreats of terrorism, as it mostly affects the safety of \r\nnon-combatants and civilian populations.\r\nI have been encouraged by the focus on development \r\nthat has characterized global discourse during the \r\npast year, notably through discussions on the SDGs \r\nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nZambia has been a beneficiary of various initiatives \r\naimed at facilitating the attainment of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which arose from the collective \r\nresolve of the generation of world leaders at the turn \r\nof the millennium. Indeed, most of our countries have \r\ncontinued to face serious challenges in the quest to \r\nfoster development and improve the quality of life of \r\nour people. The challenges are numerous, including \r\nenergy shortages and the effects of climate change. \r\nThe two are inseparable on the development agenda \r\nfor countries such as Zambia that rely heavily on \r\nhydropower generation.\r\nThe changing rainfall pattern has adversely \r\naffected power-generation capacities in most of our \r\ncountries. This year, Zambia is experiencing an \r\nunprecedented energy crisis, which has already cost \r\nthe nation dearly in terms of productivity, jobs and \r\nrevenue. Beyond the economic limitations, the social \r\nramifications are equally devastating to the country. \r\nIt is therefore important that much effort be exerted \r\nto develop mitigation strategies to counter the effects \r\nof climate change. Furthermore, developing countries \r\nare still grappling with other challenges, such as \r\npoverty, high unemployment — particularly among \r\nthe youth — skewed industrial development, low \r\nintraregional trade, inadequate infrastructure, low \r\nproductivity in agriculture and livestock, poor quality \r\nhealth services and the challenges of access to quality \r\neducation.\r\nAs we move forward, it is important for us to \r\nacknowledge the realities and imperatives of the world \r\ntoday and to renew our common resolve to sustain \r\nthe core principles of our Organization as the United \r\nNations. We should redouble our efforts, by harnessing \r\nour individual strengths in order to collectively address \r\nthe rather complex challenges that confront us in our \r\nincreasingly globalized and interdependent world.\r\nGiven the demographic nature of our communities, \r\npoverty remains a real concern, particularly in rural \r\nareas. In Zambia, 70 per cent of the people in rural areas \r\ndepend on agriculture for their livelihood. Agriculture \r\nis one of my Government’s priority areas in the county’s \r\nefforts to diversify the economy, apart from mining. \r\nThe Government is therefore devising interventions \r\naimed at improving capacities and adding value for \r\nboth subsistence farmers and commercial farmers. \r\nOur interventions, notably the Farmer Input Support \r\nProgramme, the Irrigation Development and Support \r\nProject, and other credit schemes, need additional \r\nsupport in order to exploit the full potential of that \r\ngiant industry. We also seek to strengthen partnerships \r\nto enable the improvement of services in such areas \r\nas providing extension services, improving access \r\nto market information and facilitating the physical \r\ntransfer of produce to markets.\r\nA key element of Zambia’s development agenda \r\nis industrialization. In that regard, my Government \r\nhas devised measures to encourage and support the \r\ndevelopment of appropriate industries, mainly in \r\nvalue-added industries, in order to spur structural \r\neconomic transformation and increase private-sector \r\nparticipation. The primary focus in that area has been \r\non areas with more backward and forward linkages so \r\nas to catapult the Zambian economy to higher levels \r\nof growth, leveraging regional value chains so as to \r\n14/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nexpand trade, attract foreign direct investment, create \r\nemployment, reduce poverty, promote sustainable \r\ndevelopment and thereby empower our people.\r\nFinancing is one of the major challenges that faces \r\ndeveloping countries. We need external resources \r\nto bridge the gap in the funds required to finance \r\ndevelopment projects. It is in that light that the United \r\nNations third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, held in Addis Ababa in July to \r\ndevelop strategies for financing development, was \r\nmost welcome. The Conference recommended several \r\nmeasures meant to bridge the financing gap, including \r\nthe need to exploit new sources of finance and \r\nimprove tax administration systems, which would be \r\nsupplemented by international support. We know that \r\nputting the appropriate infrastructure in place is very \r\nimportant in our quest to expand intra-Africa trade, \r\nbolster our productive capacities and enhance Africa’s \r\ncompetitiveness in the global market. In that regard, we \r\nmust quickly identify sources to raise the $100 billion \r\nAfrica needs annually to finance its infrastructure \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is equally important, from the perspective of \r\nlandlocked developing countries, to remain committed \r\nto implementing the decisions of the 2014 Vienna \r\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries for the Decade 2014-2024. In keeping with \r\nthat commitment, Zambia was privileged to host a \r\nhigh-level meeting on the follow-up to the Second \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries, held in Livingstone in June. I was honoured to \r\nofficiate at the Conference and hope that the Assembly \r\nfinds the time to review the outcome document, entitled \r\n“Livingstone Call for Action”.\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to gender and \r\nwomen’s empowerment. The International Conference \r\non Population and Development Beyond 2014 Global \r\nReview Report, published in June 2013, indicates that \r\n35 per cent of women have been victims of gender-\r\nbased violence. Indeed, Zambia acknowledges that the \r\nproblem extends to most nations, including our own. \r\nTo that end, we are already implementing important \r\ninterventions to curb that scourge. Our approach to \r\ndevelopment will not be limited to the economy but \r\nwill continue to focus on all pillars of development. \r\nI welcome the fact that our traditional leaders, the \r\nUnited Nations system and civil society have all been \r\nseamlessly working with Governments in fighting for \r\ngender equality for our women and girls.\r\nOne of the most important programmes, and one in \r\nwhich I have been engaged as a designated champion, \r\nis the “He For She” campaign, which seeks to address \r\nissues of gender-based violence. That project was \r\ninitiated by UN-Women in September 2014 with the \r\naim of addressing incidents of gender-based violence. \r\nIn a few days, my Government will also launch the \r\nUnited States-supported “From Boys to Men” project, \r\nwhich targets the 15-to-21-year-old age group and is \r\naimed at encouraging the development of a non-violent \r\ngeneration. In our determination to bridge the gap \r\nbetween the sexes, a vigorous campaign is under way \r\nto strengthen the education of girls by encouraging \r\nthem to complete their schooling and unlock their \r\ndevelopmental potential instead of being pushed into \r\nchild-, early or forced marriages.\r\nThe situation of our young people remains daunting, \r\nwith unemployment one of the major challenges they \r\nface. To address that situation, my Government recently \r\nlaunched a national youth policy that seeks to lay a \r\nfoundation for interventions of various kinds aimed at \r\nsupporting the development of a vibrant and productive \r\ngeneration. We hope to create 500,000 jobs over the \r\nnext five years, an effort that will depend heavily on \r\nthe private-sector-led job market. We are also making \r\nefforts to address the specific social disadvantages \r\nof the most marginalized members of our society, \r\nincluding the disabled. We want to ensure that they can \r\nrealize their potential and serve in national development \r\nefforts in the same way as anyone else.\r\nThe challenges are many, but they are not \r\ninsurmountable. The United Nations has been a key \r\nally in addressing some of those problems, and indeed, \r\nto a large extent, the story of Zambia is the story of \r\nthe United Nations. I am confident that through our \r\nconcerted and collective efforts, determination and \r\nhard work, coupled with able and visionary leadership, \r\nwe shall indeed overcome. I look forward to working \r\nwith everyone here so as to ensure that our shared \r\nsolutions are brought forward and implemented in the \r\nspirit of this Organization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Zambia for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n15-29437 15/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Toomas \r\nHendrik Ilves, President of the Republic of Estonia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ilves: When I addressed the Assembly \r\nlast year (see A/69/PV.8), foremost on our minds was \r\nthe state of European and global security. The blatant \r\nviolation of international law in connection with the \r\noccupation of Ukrainian territory that we witnessed \r\nin the spring of 2014 triggered a profound change in \r\nthe global security situation. A year later, we are still \r\nadapting to that altered, more unpredictable state of \r\naffairs. As we continue to tackle global challenges, \r\nincluding terrorism, climate change, poverty and \r\nhuman rights violations, the number of conflicts and \r\ncrises worldwide continues to grow.\r\nWe also witnessed a positive development recently. \r\nLet us hope that the historic agreement on Iran’s nuclear \r\nprogramme will pave the way for greater stability in the \r\nbroader Middle East. It is a region where conflicts in \r\nSyria and Libya have led to the radicalization of an ever \r\ngreater number of people and to the emergence of the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). It poses a \r\nserious threat to peace and security in Syria, Iraq and \r\nthe broader Middle East. ISIL violates universal human \r\nvalues. No country is immune to the threat that it poses. \r\nStopping ISIL and other terrorist organizations requires \r\na global effort. Estonia supports the Global Coalition to \r\nCounter ISIL, and we believe that the United Nations \r\nand the Global Counterterrorism Forum also have an \r\nimportant role to play there.\r\nThe ongoing crises and conflicts, including in Syria \r\nand Libya, have also led to the current refugee crisis in \r\nEurope. While Europe’s refugee crisis has been in the \r\ninternational headlines in recent months, the problem \r\nitself is obviously wider and more global. According \r\nto United Nations statistics, one in every 122 persons \r\nis now either a refugee, an asylum seeker abroad or an \r\ninternally displaced person in his or her home country. \r\nWorldwide, 42,000 people f lee their homes every day. \r\nNever before have there been so many people forced \r\nto be on the move. The civil war in Syria alone has \r\ncreated more than 4 million refugees. The majority of \r\nthem have sought refuge in neighbouring countries, \r\nwhich have borne by far the greatest burden. But many \r\nrefugees have opted to take the dangerous route across \r\nthe Mediterranean and have ended up in Europe. There \r\nwere 600,000 asylum seekers in Europe in 2014, and \r\nthere will be far more this year.\r\nI am also extremely worried about the rising support \r\nthat we are witnessing for far-right and far-left political \r\nmovements in Europe, often fuelled by anti-immigrant, \r\nracist statements that threaten the liberal-democratic \r\nbase of our continent that has allowed us to live in \r\nprosperity since the Second World War. Short-sighted \r\npopulist policies exploiting the fears of ordinary people \r\nwill lead nowhere.\r\nThe European Union (EU) is the main donor \r\nin the effort to alleviate the Syrian refugee crisis. \r\nApproximately €4 billion has been mobilized by the \r\nEuropean Commission and EU member States for \r\nhumanitarian, development, economic and stabilization \r\nassistance to Syrian internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees. And more efforts are being planned, including \r\nan African trust fund. The aim is to shift the focus from \r\ndealing with the consequences of the migration crisis \r\nto dealing with its root causes. But this truly biblical \r\nmovement of people demands a global response.\r\nWe not only have the responsibility to bring peace \r\nand stability to Syria and Libya but also to put an end \r\nto the aggression against Ukraine. Compared to what it \r\nwas a year ago, the armed conflict in eastern Ukraine \r\nis less intense, but daily fighting continues. Crimea \r\nremains illegally occupied. Those responsible for the \r\ndowning of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH-17 are still at \r\nlarge. The attempts to obstruct justice on that matter \r\nare deeply disturbing. The long-standing protracted \r\nconflicts in Georgia, Moldova and Nagorno Karabakh \r\nremain unresolved. Dialogue and diplomatic efforts to \r\nfind a solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict must \r\ncontinue. A solution to the conflict must, however, not \r\ncome at the expense of the principles that underpin \r\nEuropean and global security. We must continue to \r\nstand up for the international agreements that we have \r\ncollectively agreed upon — the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris for \r\na New Europe — and demand that they be honoured \r\n16/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nand enforced. We must continue to stand up to attempts \r\nto divide countries and establish spheres of influence.\r\nAs the number of conflicts and crises worldwide \r\ngrows, respect for human rights has become more \r\nimportant than ever. We must uphold universal values \r\nand stop massive violations of human rights and \r\ncrimes against humanity, regardless of who or what \r\ncaused them. As stated in the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, human rights apply to everyone without \r\nexception.\r\nThis year marks the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nBeijing Declaration and the Platform of Action, which \r\nhave influenced how we address equality and women’s \r\nrights today. We need to continuously stand for the \r\nrights of women and girls and strive for the elimination \r\nof gender-based violence. Women’s rights and the \r\nempowerment of women and girls must be promoted \r\nat all levels. I welcome the 2015 high-level review and \r\nglobal study on the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) and hope that it will provide us \r\nwith a new impetus to move forward on those issues. \r\nWe must advance global actions linked to the welfare \r\nof children by investing in their education and health, \r\nas well as by keeping them away from armed conflicts.\r\nAn active and dynamic civil society is a precondition \r\nfor prosperity. A free press, the freedom of speech and \r\nthe freedom of conscience are the cornerstones of any \r\nopen society. In an era of so-called multiple narratives, \r\nwe must pay tribute to those activists, journalists and \r\nbloggers who risk their lives to expose the truth.\r\nThis year, the Human Rights Council established a \r\nmandate on the right to privacy. Journalists, bloggers, \r\nhuman rights activists and many others living under \r\nauthoritarian regimes have urged their Governments to \r\nstop the arbitrary or unlawful interference with their \r\nprivacy. They have called on their Governments to stop \r\ntaking over their emails, closing their blogs and applying \r\ncensorship. Unfortunately, the situation concerning \r\nthe right to privacy and the freedom of expression has \r\nworsened during the past several years. Governments \r\nmust protect the right to privacy, as stated in articles \r\n2, 17 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights. Any interference with privacy must be \r\nlawful and reasonable. At the same time, the right to \r\nthe freedom of expression must be guaranteed. Estonia \r\nhas high expectations with regard to the new mandate.\r\nThis is a crucial year for global action against \r\npoverty and for promoting sustainable development. \r\nI welcome the historic agreement reached on the \r\nSustainable Development Goals in the form of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Action (resolution 70/1). \r\nNational Governments can play a key role in creating \r\nan environment conducive to sustainable development. \r\nThe promotion of peaceful and inclusive societies, the \r\nrespect for human rights, gender equality, the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance, as well as environmental \r\nsustainability, are central to the new global partnership. \r\nEconomic growth is, assuredly, important, but must not \r\ncome at the expense of the environment. The twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Conference of Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held soon in Paris, should reach an agreement that \r\npromotes those goals.\r\nThe smart use of the Internet and digital \r\ntechnologies can be essential drivers for economic \r\ngrowth and development. We need strong public policies \r\nso that the digital era can become a genuine success \r\nand a motor of development for each country and each \r\nmember of society. That requires a stable, predictable \r\nlegal environment that encourages foreign investment \r\nand competition. We also need an educational system \r\nthat teaches the necessary new skills, and we need an \r\naccessible Internet and Internet freedom. Those are \r\nsteps that only Governments can provide.\r\nNinety per cent of the people without access to \r\nthe Internet live in the developing world. Bridging the \r\ndigital divide among and within countries — across \r\nborders, gender, income and age — is essential for a \r\ncontemporary digital economy. In 2016, the Internet \r\nitself will become the world’s fifth-largest economy, \r\nbehind only those of the United States, China, Japan \r\nand India. It is time for world leaders to place the \r\npotential of digital technologies at the top of the \r\ndevelopment agenda. I am personally glad to co-chair \r\nthe advisory panel for the upcoming World Bank World \r\nDevelopment Report 2016. That report, entitled “Digital \r\nDividends”, examines how the Internet can be a force \r\nfor development and asks, importantly, what is required \r\nto unlock the still largely unrealized potential of digital \r\ntechnologies.\r\nAdherence to the principle of the rule of law is an \r\nessential cornerstone of peace and security. Estonia \r\nstrongly supports the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nin its activities, including its quest to end impunity. We \r\ncall on all countries that have not yet done so to join the \r\nRome Statute of the ICC. We also urge all States parties \r\nto join in the ratification of the outcome documents of \r\n15-29437 17/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nthe Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the ICC. \r\nThe responsibility to provide accountability is, first \r\nand foremost, a domestic task. It is therefore essential \r\nthat States build their national capacities to investigate \r\nand prosecute serious international crimes. Estonia has \r\nprovided development cooperation resources to assist \r\ncountries in their national implementation of the Rome \r\nStatute, and we encourage other States parties to act in \r\na similar manner.\r\nUnder the first pillar of the responsibility to protect, \r\nall States Members of the United Nations commit \r\nto protect their people from genocide, war crimes, \r\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. On the \r\noccasion of the tenth anniversary of the responsibility \r\nto protect, I reiterate our support for that principle, and \r\ncall on the international community to make a renewed \r\ncommitment to prevent genocide, war crimes, ethnic \r\ncleansing and crimes against humanity. The Security \r\nCouncil bears primary responsibility in that regard. \r\nUnfortunately, in the most serious situations, the \r\nSecurity Council has failed to act owing to the abuse of \r\nthe veto. It is disappointing that in cases such as those \r\nof Syria and Ukraine, Council debates have brought no \r\nresult. Council members must not vote against actions \r\naimed at preventing and stopping mass atrocities. We \r\ntherefore support the initiatives of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency (ACT) group and of \r\nFrance and Mexico on the non-use of the veto in cases \r\nof genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes or \r\nother atrocities.\r\nSecurity Council reform clearly needs to become a \r\nreality. United Nations reform, which Estonia strongly \r\nsupports, is not only about the Security Council. We \r\nsee this seventieth anniversary of the United Nations as \r\na good opportunity to make progress on reform. As a \r\nmember of the ACT group, Estonia is eager to increase \r\ntransparency in the process of the election of the next \r\nSecretary-General. I am glad that some ACT proposals \r\nhave already contributed to making the process more \r\ntransparent. For the first time in the history of the \r\nUnited Nations, an agreement has emerged to the effect \r\nthat the election process, the lists of candidates and \r\ninformal meetings should begin in a concrete way. I \r\nhope for close cooperation between the Presidents of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council to that \r\nend.\r\nLet me stress the importance of taking responsibility. \r\nWe are being assaulted by an avalanche of problems. It \r\nis especially important that we adhere to our values and \r\nstand by our commitments. Only then will the concepts \r\nof human rights, equality, democracy and international \r\nlaw acquire meaning. Only if we uphold those values \r\nwill we be able to surmount the turbulent times in \r\nwhich we find ourselves today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Estonia for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President \r\nof the Dominican Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Medina Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): It \r\nis an honour to participate once again in the work of \r\nthe General Assembly as a representative of the people \r\nand the Government of the Dominican Republic. At \r\nthe outset, I would like to welcome and congratulate \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nThis anniversary gives us the opportunity to put \r\nin perspective what the Organization has meant for \r\nhumankind. It was established 70 years ago as the fruit \r\nof the worst horrors of war and as the first global forum \r\ncreated to preserve peace, coexistence and the well-\r\nbeing of all human beings. It is true that the United \r\nNations was born of the wounds, pain and fear left by \r\nthe great conflicts of the twentieth century, but it also \r\narose from the unstoppable force of hope and the iron \r\nwill of great men and women who believed in dialogue, \r\nsolidarity and the grandeur of the human race.\r\nAlthough we still have far to go and although \r\nimmense challenges remain, the Organization \r\ncontinues to represent the values that inspire us day \r\n18/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nafter day. Over the past 12 months, the international \r\ncommunity has experienced difficult challenges, \r\nbut it has also witnessed encouraging events that we \r\nwould do well to recall. We witnessed the reopening of \r\nembassies between the United States and Cuba, which \r\nbrings us closer to the day when that sad, decades-long \r\nconflict will finally come to rest in the history books. \r\nWe are also putting the final touches on a renewed \r\ncommitment to global development, which is enshrined \r\nin the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1). At the same time, the industrialized nations have \r\nfinally taken a decisive and resolute step forward to \r\ncombat climate change. We welcome their political \r\nwill, for which we have been calling for some time, \r\nbecause we believe it represents an act of responsibility \r\nand justice that heralds a more equitable model for the \r\ndistribution of responsibilities between rich and poor \r\nnations.\r\nThe post-2015 development Agenda provides \r\nan excellent opportunity for us to focus on our most \r\ncentral priority and the greatest enemy of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, namely, inequality. The fight against \r\ninequality is the point of departure for solving the \r\nmajority of the global challenges, yet it remains our \r\nmain unfinished task throughout the world, especially \r\nin Latin America. If we review our achievements, we \r\nsee a landscape filled with light and shadow, one that \r\noffers grounds for rejoicing but also one that prompts \r\nurgent calls to action. On the one hand, Latin America, \r\nafter Asia, is the region with the largest middle class, \r\nwith more than 130 million people projected to attain \r\nthat status by 2030, according to the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development.\r\nHowever, along with sub-Saharan Africa, it is \r\nalso the most unequal region in the world. Even today, \r\nthe wealthiest 10 per cent of Latin Americans receive \r\n32 per cent of the region’s income, while the poorest \r\n40 per cent receive only 15 per cent. So, despite our \r\nefforts to combat poverty, it remains excessive and is \r\naggravated by great inequality. As the excellent 2014 \r\nstudy by the Economic Commission for Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean (ECLAC), entitled “Instability and \r\ninequality”, points out, greater equality with growth \r\nrequires two profound changes — first, in our structure \r\nof production, and secondly, in our structure of \r\ndistribution. In other words, growth is as necessary for \r\nequality as equality is for growth. To put it even more \r\nclearly, we need both a responsible productive sector that \r\nguarantees wealth creation across all layers of society \r\nand an active, effective State to ensure the redistribution \r\nof wealth and the creation of opportunities.\r\nHowever, if we look at the current structure of \r\nthe productive mechanisms of the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica, we have to acknowledge the differences within \r\nthat structure. In other words, we need to recognize that \r\nat least three levels of development exist simultaneously \r\nin each country. On our journey towards progress, we \r\nnot only ride in different cars and in different classes, but \r\non different rails, which means that we move forward at \r\nradically different speeds. According to a recent study \r\nof 18 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nthat was conducted by ECLAC and the German Agency \r\nfor International Cooperation, our region operates a \r\nhigh-speed rail system, as it were, which connects \r\nmodern global businesses to international trade and \r\naccounts for 60 per cent of gross domestic product but \r\nonly 20 per cent of jobs; a medium-speed rail, which \r\nprevails in the middle income countries, accounting for \r\n22.5 per cent of gross domestic product and 30 per cent \r\nof jobs; and finally, a rail that serves micro-businesses \r\nand the informal economy, which together bring in only \r\n10.5 per cent of wealth but account for 50 per cent of \r\njobs. That makes it impossible for everyone to benefit \r\nand participate proportionally in growth.\r\nAs the ECLAC study makes clear, what we have \r\nis a structural factory for inequality, which means that \r\nmajor changes will be needed to correct our path and \r\nenable everyone to advance at the same rate. We need to \r\nchange the structure of production, shatter the old ways \r\nand move ahead together to a model that will benefit \r\neveryone, big and small. To begin with, it is essential \r\nthat the “middle way” be promoted in particular. Public \r\npolicies must help to ensure that small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises have better access to credit and are \r\nmore competitive, productive and innovative. Small \r\nand medium-sized enterprises must also become \r\nactors in globalization, finding their proper place in \r\nthe production chains. In that way they will be able to \r\nprovide not just more jobs, but proper jobs, high-quality \r\njobs, and they will be able to hire an increasingly well-\r\ntrained labour force.\r\nAlong with the necessary changes in the structure \r\nof our economies, the State should be the second pillar \r\nof the fight against inequality. We have to reassert the \r\nrole of the State as an effective redistributor of wealth, \r\nas a creator of opportunities and as a defender of the \r\nrights of all citizens.\r\n15-29437 19/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nLet us remember the counterexample of what \r\nhappened in the 1980s, during the so-called lost \r\ndecade. Poverty increased to cover almost half of the \r\nLatin American population. The austerity policy that \r\nmany States opted for further aggravated the situation \r\nand slowed the recovery. In the next decade, the 1990s, \r\nthe recovery began, and there was major progress in \r\nkey areas, such as education. That yielded fruit in 2002, \r\nwhen a labour force that was better educated than their \r\nparents was finally able to finally benefit from an \r\nexpanding economy and higher wages.\r\nSince then, the Gini index on income inequality \r\nhas dropped by 5 per cent. That shows clearly that \r\nsocial policies are essential, along with changes in \r\nproductivity and improvements in the labour market. \r\nWe cannot continue looking at the relationship between \r\neconomic policies and social policies as an unresolvable \r\nconflict. Rather, we have to tackle both aspects at the \r\nsame time and move in the same direction to reduce \r\ninequality. Only in that way can we deal with problems \r\nthat seem to be endemic, but that actually derive in \r\nlarge measure from the disproportionate allocation of \r\navailable resources.\r\nLook at what has been happening to our youth. \r\nToday, this generation of young people has received \r\nmore years of schooling than anybody else in our history. \r\nAnd yet, they have higher rates of unemployment and \r\nonly part-time work. Another paradox is that, although \r\nthey have more years of schooling, only one third of \r\npoor students, according to tests, meet the minimum \r\nreading competency levels. In parallel, the increasing \r\nautomation of work means that soon, instead of choosing \r\nbetween skilled and unskilled jobs, it will be a question \r\nof skilled jobs or simply unemployment. Therefore, if \r\nwe do not want that scenario to continue perpetuating \r\nexclusion, we have no other option than to make a firm \r\ncommitment to quality education. And we have to do \r\nthat in a serious way. The Dominican Republic is trying \r\nto improve the quality of its educational system, and \r\nwe are also trying to achieve the necessary changes to \r\nmake our economy grow in equality, so that our State \r\ncan be active in supporting its people.\r\nInequality is the root cause of many of the challenges \r\nthat we face globally, including violence and insecurity, \r\nwhich particularly aff lict Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean. Ours is the only region where the homicide \r\nrate has increased over the past 15 years. There is a lot \r\nof discussion about the relationship between violence \r\nand inequality. Recent studies show that a 1 per cent \r\nincrease in the Gini index leads to a similar rise in \r\nthe homicide rate. And though it may sound harsh to \r\ndescribe that terrible tragedy in economic terms, we \r\ncannot fail to note that the impact of violence on people \r\nand goods costs us 14.2 per cent of the gross domestic \r\nproduct in the Latin American region. At the same time, \r\ninequality is also a breeding ground for transnational \r\ncrime and drug trafficking, which are recruiting young \r\npeople at an increasingly early age and robbing them of \r\nfuture opportunities.\r\nTherefore, one of the tasks facing us at the \r\ninternational level is to rethink our policies on how \r\nto combat drugs. As members of the Assembly know, \r\nnext year the special session on the world drug problem \r\nwill take place, at the request of Mexico, Guatemala \r\nand Colombia. We hope that, by the time that session \r\nis held, the idea that drugs constitute a problem that \r\naffects only some countries will have been dismissed \r\nfor good. The tens of thousands of people killed in the \r\nso-called war on drug trafficking in Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean cannot be regarded as collateral damage. \r\nIt is a humanitarian disaster that is due too often to \r\npolicies that have been badly designed and/or are \r\npoorly implemented. We need to change our focus and \r\nreach a new, more updated and realistic international \r\nconsensus that leaves room for national Governments \r\nto design policies suited to their circumstances, as \r\nsome countries represented here are already doing.\r\nIn conclusion, may I return to the more optimistic \r\nnote on which I began. The international community, \r\nrepresented here in the General Assembly, has made \r\nhistoric progress. Although we know that much remains \r\nto be done, the balance of what has been achieved in \r\nterms of the Millennium Development Goals shows that \r\nwe can move ahead when we focus our efforts properly. \r\nOur experience in the Dominican Republic shows that \r\nhaving a clear agenda and a common course is the \r\nonly way to move forward rapidly. We have therefore \r\nprepared our post-2015 development agenda, which \r\nleads us to propose a major partnership between the \r\nprivate sector, civil society and Government so that the \r\nchange can be lasting and sustainable. We believe that \r\nwhen the political will exists, no challenge is too great. \r\nI have no doubt that we can find the will to overcome \r\nthe challenges before us.\r\nThe post-2015 agenda provides the opportunity \r\nto focus our efforts on the roots of the problems. The \r\ntime is now. The responsibility is ours. From now on, \r\nlet us work to create countries with equal opportunities \r\n20/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nfor and access to development for all our citizens. We \r\nare working for equality and solidarity and for a fair \r\ndistribution of the resources of this planet that we share.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Dominican Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations Her Excellency Mrs. Dalia \r\nGrybauskaitė, President of the Republic of Lithuania, \r\nand to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grybauskaitė: The seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations offers us an opportunity to renew \r\nour commitments to the ideals and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Today, those ideals and \r\nprinciples are threatened in so many ways around the \r\nglobe. We are witnessing the largest displacement of \r\npeople since the Second World War. As of last year, \r\nnearly 60 million people were displaced by war, conflict \r\nor persecution. Violent extremism is on the rise, with \r\nterrorist groups demonstrating new levels of brutality \r\nand barbarity. In the twenty-first century, women \r\nand girls are sold in slave markets by the criminals of \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) and abused in \r\nunspeakable ways. We have entered an era where the \r\nmost primitive and brutal executions coexist with the \r\nmost sophisticated information warfare, hybrid warfare \r\nand cyberwarfare.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations has been breached \r\nin the middle of Europe, with no consequences. Last \r\nyear, Russia annexed Crimea, and the Kremlin seeks \r\nto rewrite history and redraw the borders of post-war \r\nEurope. Even in the context of the multiple crises \r\nand security challenges the world is facing today, \r\nthe annexation of Crimea and military aggression in \r\neastern Ukraine stand out because of their implications \r\nfor the future of international peace and security. These \r\nacts strike at the very core of international law and at \r\nuniversally accepted norms of behaviour that have \r\nallowed the world community to survive without world \r\nwars for seven decades.\r\nWe cannot pledge respect for the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and ignore its breaches at the same time. \r\nOur collective failure to stand up for the underlying \r\nprinciples of the independence, sovereignty, unity and \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine will have far-reaching \r\nnegative repercussions for international order. The \r\noccupied territories of Ukraine, Georgia or Moldova \r\nare full of red lines that we ourselves have drawn but \r\nnever acted upon. Again, we are reminded that if one \r\ncloses one’s eyes to crimes, they do not disappear. They \r\nspread, grow and finally they take over. That is why it \r\nis our duty to uphold international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights laws and to seek accountability when \r\nthese laws are violated. Vetoing a Security Council \r\nresolution to commemorate the Srebrenica massacre or \r\nto set up a tribunal for the downing of Flight MH-17 \r\nis unjustifiable and is an insult to the memory of the \r\nvictims. It also raises questions about the relevance, in \r\nthe twenty-first century, of the Security Council as it \r\nis today.\r\nFor the Council to maintain its credibility, the least \r\nit can do is put an end to the use of the veto in cases of \r\ngenocide, atrocity crimes, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes. Where would we be today had the Council \r\nbeen able to secure proper humanitarian access in \r\nSyria, had it taken measures to stop the use of barrel \r\nbombs and ensure accountability for gross human \r\nrights violations and abuses? The Security Council \r\nfailed to do so, and millions of Syrians had to f lee. By \r\nprotecting the criminals, the four vetoes of resolutions \r\npertaining to Syria did nothing to resolve the situation.\r\nAs a result, today we have the largest humanitarian \r\ncrisis in the world. It is a global crisis that requires \r\na global response. Unless we address the causes that \r\nmake people f lee their homes — such as lawlessness, \r\nrepression and grave human rights abuses, corruption \r\nand poor governance, massive inequalities and \r\nmarginalization — these f lows of refugees will not \r\nstop. Conflicts will continue. Lawlessness breeds the \r\nworst of the worst — extremism, radicals and terrorists. \r\nWe simply cannot afford for this to happen.\r\n15-29437 21/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nWe live in an era when challenges and threats are \r\nenhanced by new ones. At 70, the United Nations must \r\nadapt to the realities of the twenty-first century and \r\nhave the tools necessary to operate. The United Nations \r\nmust do much better, tackling the underlying causes of \r\nthe problems and conflicts at hand, and not merely the \r\nsymptoms. It must be equipped and staffed to operate \r\nin environments of asymmetric and hybrid warfare, \r\ninformation wars and the growing threat of terrorism. \r\nIt must also do a lot better at prevention and mediation, \r\nin order to save lives, as well as resources.\r\nIn the twenty-first century the world will need a \r\nstrong United Nations that has been renewed in every \r\nsphere. Either we act now and shape globalization \r\nthrough cooperation and partnership, or the crises \r\nand conflicts of the globalized world will force us to \r\nrespond at a much greater cost to all of us. The United \r\nNations will cease to exist if people stop believing in it. \r\nThrough our activities, 70 years after the founding of \r\nthe United Nations, we must show that we continue to \r\nbelieve firmly in this Organization, which we all share.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Lithuania for the statement she has \r\njust made.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. James Alix Michel, President of the \r\nRepublic of Seychelles\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Seychelles.\r\nMr. James Alix Michel, President of the Republic of \r\nSeychelles, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. James Alix \r\nMichel, President of the Republic of Seychelles, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Michel: “We the peoples of the United \r\nNations, determined ...”. Yes, these are bold and \r\nvisionary words drafted 70 years ago, providing the \r\nUnited Nations with its sense of purpose and the world \r\nwith a vision that continues to inspire and motivate us. \r\nI have always believed in this vision. We all do, in fact. \r\nYet, in spite of all the good intentions and the inspiration \r\nwe continue to draw from the Charter, something seems \r\nto be sorely lacking. That something is determination. \r\nPresident Lykketoft’s urging for a new commitment to \r\naction more than confirms this. His experience affords \r\nhim the privilege of speaking his mind, and so does \r\nmine.\r\nWe must look around us. Let us look at the world. \r\nIt is a world lacking in determination, a world torn \r\napart by vicious wars and conflicts. It is a world where \r\npoverty, hunger, famine and epidemics continue to grow \r\nunabated, where inequality, injustice and disparity are \r\non the rise; a world where environmental degradation \r\nand despoliation go unchecked; a world — our \r\nworld — menaced by climate change.\r\nIs that the legacy we want to leave to our children? \r\nNo, my friends, it cannot be so. We must hear the cries \r\nof children who are hungry or in distress. We must hear \r\nthe cries of despair of islanders affected by climate \r\nchange. We must feel the pain of women struggling to \r\nkeep their children alive. We must stop spending money \r\nto destroy lives. Instead, we must act together, not only \r\nto keep alive those struggling to survive, but to give \r\nmeaning to their lives. We therefore have a duty and an \r\nobligation to change the world we live in and to make it \r\na better place for current and future generations.\r\nWe can make that happen if we set our minds to \r\nit; if we, who are in the privileged position of leading \r\nour peoples, accept our responsibilities; if we cast aside \r\nindecisiveness; if we look beyond the narrow pursuit \r\nof ideological and national interests. We can make it \r\nhappen if we adopt the principles of justice and fairness, \r\nnot half-heartedly but resolutely.\r\nLet us start with the United Nations itself. Its \r\nlofty ideals are as relevant today as when it was \r\nfounded. However, its structures of governance, \r\nparticularly the Security Council, are not. In today’s \r\nworld, it represents a fundamentally undemocratic and \r\nunrepresentative institution. The same applies to the \r\ninternational organizations set up in the wake of the \r\ncreation of the United Nations. We have to make them \r\nrelevant to the realities of the present era. We need \r\naction, determination and commitment to set things \r\nright, to make all of them relevant to the century we \r\nlive in and to give true meaning to an all-inclusive and \r\nparticipatory democracy.\r\n22/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nWe also need resolute action if the spirit and \r\nessence of sustainable development is to be truly \r\nembraced globally. Many challenges still remain, \r\nespecially for small island developing States (SIDS). \r\nWe are the sentinels of nature and the guardians of the \r\noceans. But the actions — or inaction, as the case may \r\nbe — of others threaten our livelihood and our very \r\nexistence. As Pope Francis has just emphasized, we \r\nmust break the current growth model and give primacy \r\nto the protection of nature over consumerism, thereby \r\nminimizing the effects of climate change. Climate \r\nchange is not of small island States’ making, yet we \r\nbear the full brunt of it. That is why we shall never \r\ncease to raise the issue in every forum, including this \r\none, because we are the conscience of the world.\r\nThe President’s acceptance speech (see A/69/PV.94) \r\nset the tone for a new commitment to action and, I \r\nbelieve, to determination. The two are indivisible. They \r\nform an appropriate backdrop to the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The 2030 \r\nAgenda sets realistic Goals, targets and a time frame for \r\nthe creation of a better world, leaving no one behind. It \r\nis an all-inclusive Agenda, which makes it abundantly \r\nclear that there can be no sustainable development \r\nwithout peace and no peace without sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nSustainability has always been and will continue \r\nto be at the heart of the development efforts of the \r\nSeychelles. Together with our fellow small island \r\ndeveloping States, we have been actively engaged in \r\nthis discourse to ensure that our concerns and needs are \r\nadequately addressed. The engagement of the United \r\nNations under the Secretary-General’s bold leadership \r\nhas given us a ray of hope. We have again seen many \r\ncommitments and pledges. But will those alone resolve \r\nour challenges? No, not unless they are translated into \r\nconcrete actions.\r\nThe application — or rather, the non-application — of \r\nthe principle of special and differential treatment for \r\nsmall island developing States is one of our major \r\npreoccupations. It is not because some of us have \r\nachieved upper-middle-income or high-income status \r\nthat our development efforts are thwarted by the \r\nnon-provision of international funds at concessionary \r\nrates. A one-size-fits-all approach to development \r\ncannot be the order of the day. It is unjust and morally \r\ninacceptable. We, the inhabitants of small island \r\ndeveloping States, will never cease to remind everyone \r\nof this. That is because islands remain the moral \r\ncompass of the world, and because our own agenda \r\nis inextricably linked to that of humankind. We will \r\nalways insist on the need for a more tailored approach \r\nin tackling the specific challenges we face, one that \r\ntakes our vulnerabilities into account. The lack of an \r\nappropriate vulnerability index that can be applied \r\neffectively to development hampers the effective \r\nempowerment of small island developing States.\r\nGoal 14 of the 2030 Agenda is of particular \r\nimportance to all SIDS and coastal States. It presents \r\nus with a unique opportunity to set a standard for \r\nglobal governance of the oceans and seas. The Goal \r\nto conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources for sustainable development provides \r\nthe thrust for the blue economy. That concept has been \r\nadopted by many small island developing States as a \r\nmechanism for realizing sustainable growth, based \r\non an ocean economy and an ocean governance. The \r\nBarbados Programme of Action, the Mauritius Strategy \r\nand the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway are key to this. For oceanic nations, \r\nthe sea is our lifeblood and the blue economy is the \r\ncatalyst through which we can learn to thrive.\r\nBut we cannot thrive in an environment of insecurity. \r\nMaritime security is of the utmost importance to the \r\nvast majority of SIDS and to coastal States. In our \r\npart of the world, though piracy is on the wane, we \r\nmust remain vigilant. As we have demonstrated in the \r\ncase of piracy, however, global alliances have made a \r\ndifference in providing security where there was none. \r\nIn that regard, I would like to express my gratitude to \r\nthe United Nations and other international partners \r\nfor all their support in our fight against piracy in \r\nthe Indian Ocean. My hope is that this model will be \r\nreplicated in order to tackle similar issues that threaten \r\nour collective resolve to build lasting peace. The likes \r\nof terrorist organizations pose threats that have lasting \r\nrepercussions, reverberating across borders. The \r\ngrowing refugee crisis reminds us that we should all \r\nshoulder the burden of fighting the ideologies of hate \r\nand embrace the bonds of fraternity and solidarity.\r\nLooking forward to the Climate Change \r\nConference in Paris, let us use the little time that is \r\nleft to build further momentum and support in order to \r\nreach an ambitious and universal agreement to combat \r\nclimate change. Paris is not just another international \r\nnegotiation. It will be the crucial and decisive moment \r\n15-29437 23/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nof choice for all of us. We cannot allow ourselves to \r\nbe condemned to the wrong side of history by our \r\ncollective failure to reach an agreement. The stakes are \r\ntoo high. An agreement is within our reach, provided \r\nwe are able to summon the collective political will \r\nand leadership. The time is now. We can make it \r\nhappen. We must make it happen. We must fulfil the \r\npromises and commitments made, especially in terms \r\nof financing options to build climate resilience. In that \r\nregard, we call on all developed countries to honour \r\ntheir commitments for the mobilization of $100 billion \r\nannually by 2020 for the operationalization of the \r\nGreen Climate Fund.\r\nSeychelles is one of the smallest Members of the \r\nUnited Nations family and will continue to play an active \r\nrole in the Organization’s efforts to create a just and safer \r\nworld. The observance of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations is a unique opportunity to transform \r\nthe world by our own efforts and commitments and \r\nto ensure that collective cooperation and partnership \r\ntriumph over rivalry and mistrust. In that spirit, we \r\nsalute the rapprochement between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba.\r\nWe have a unique opportunity to choose the \r\nfuture we want for ourselves and for our youth and our \r\nchildren. We must give them a better deal because they \r\ndeserve a better deal. Let us truly become what we are \r\ndestined to be — committed, determined, united and \r\nempowered nations forging our future together. Yes, \r\ntogether.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Seychelles for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. James Alix Michel, President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Miloš Zeman, President of the \r\nCzech Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Miloš Zeman, President of the Czech Republic, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Miloš Zeman, \r\nPresident of the Czech Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Zeman: If a speaker has many topics in \r\na short speech, he has none. If he has many priorities \r\nin his speech, he also has none. So let me concentrate \r\non a one topic and one priority — the fight against \r\ninternational terrorism.\r\nOne may ask: why does the President of a small \r\nCentral European country speak about terrorism? \r\nThere are two reasons. First, terrorism is outrage \r\nagainst human civilization and, at the same time, it is \r\nthe main danger for human civilization. The second \r\nreason is that today, as the Assembly is aware, nearly all \r\nEuropean countries face a big migration wave that was \r\nprovoked by and is a consequence of terrorist actions in \r\nthe Middle East and in Africa.\r\nIt is wonderful to criticize terrorism. It is wonderful \r\nto organize demonstrations and manifestations against \r\nterrorism, and it is nice to prepare declarations protesting \r\nterrorism. I am sure that Mr. Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, \r\nreading such declarations, will be careful. In any case, \r\nthere are three illusions concerning terrorism.\r\nThe first illusion is that terrorism will vanish, that \r\nit is something like a historical f luctuation, and that \r\nwe can eliminate or reduce terrorist actions without \r\nhuman endeavour or by using only local means. On \r\nthe contrary, the terrorist movement is growing like \r\na cancer. There is a diffusion of terrorism, a growing \r\nnumber of so-called failed States, of assassinations, \r\ncruelties, murders, annihilation of cultural artefacts, \r\nsuch as the Palmyra ruins, and so on. We cannot deny \r\nthis growing process.\r\nThe second illusion is that we can reduce terrorist \r\norganizations to the so-called Islamic State only. But \r\nthere are many other terrorist organizations — for \r\ninstance, Al-Qaida, the Taliban, Al-Nusra, Boko Haram \r\nand others. Two outstanding politicians from the Arab \r\nworld told me that the cover organization is the Muslim \r\nBrotherhood. If so, there is a terrorism network, and \r\nthat network cannot be reduced simply to the Islamic \r\nState.\r\nThe third illusion is based on a standard form of \r\nwarfare against terrorism. We know that nearly all \r\ngenerals prepare for the previous war. What I propose \r\n24/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nfor the fight against terrorism are no tanks, no infantry, \r\nno artillery. We need to seek new forms for the fight. \r\nBecause unilateral actions are heavily criticized and, \r\nwhat is more, have been completely unsuccessful, as \r\nin the case of Iraq, I do not recommend any massive \r\noccupation of any territory. What I recommend \r\nis a coordinated action, under the umbrella of the \r\nSecurity Council. The five permanent members of \r\nthe Council have different interests but one common \r\nenemy, and nothing unites more than one common \r\nenemy — terrorism. Here in New York, we remember \r\n11 September 2001; in Russia, we remember Beslan and \r\nVolgograd; in China we remember Xinjiang; in Europe \r\nwe remember Madrid, London, Paris and Copenhagen; \r\nin India we remember Bombay, and so on.\r\nThere is one good precedent, and it is the \r\nunanimously adopted Security Council resolution \r\n2184 (2014), concerning pirates in Somalia, including \r\nmilitary action against pirates. Does anyone really \r\nthink that the pirates are more dangerous than the \r\nterrorists? In the Charter of the United Nations, there \r\nare many, many Articles concerning the possibility of \r\nmilitary action, and some of them are never activated. \r\nThey are referred to as the sleeping structures. What \r\nwe need is to activate them. We need small military \r\nunits equipped with drones, helicopters, cooperation of \r\nsecret services, commandos or rangers — some kind of \r\ncontingent of Blue Helmets — which would eliminate \r\nthe leaders of terrorist organizations and their nerve \r\ncentres, and not the occupation of territory.\r\nI firmly hope that some of the permanent members \r\nmight propose such a resolution. If not, as a historical \r\noptimist, I might add a conclusion that any idea goes \r\nthrough three phases. In the first phase, it is understood \r\nas complete nonsense. In the second phase, it is \r\ndisputable, and in the third phase, it is as evident as \r\nthe Earth’s movement around the sun. I will return \r\nnext year, and deep in my heart, I do believe that my \r\nproposal will be disputable. When I come in 2017, I am \r\nsure that this proposal will be evident.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Czech Republic for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Miloš Zeman, President of the Czech Republic, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour, President of the Republic of \r\nYemen, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mansour (spoke in Arabic): On behalf of \r\nthe people and the Government of Yemen, I would like \r\nto congratulate the President most warmly on presiding \r\nover the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I \r\nwish him every success.\r\nI have come today from the brave and strategic \r\ncity of Aden, which is experiencing great joy because \r\nit has been liberated from the Houthi militia and \r\nformer President Saleh. Yet I am troubled to see the \r\ndegree of damage that was left in the wake of those \r\ncriminal militias, including the destruction of the city \r\nand the violence against its civilians. The tragedy is \r\ncontinuing in the cities of Taiz and Marib. It beggars \r\nthe imagination to think that the number of martyrs just \r\nin Aden alone has reached 1,350, while the number of \r\ninjured has reached 11,160. One can only imagine what \r\nthe numbers are in Taiz, Marib, Al-Baydhah, Abyan \r\nand other Yemeni cities.\r\nThree years ago, I addressed the Assembly and \r\nspoke of the different measures that we had undertaken \r\nin our country in order to ensure a successful political \r\ntransition of power in a spirit of peace and in compliance \r\nwith the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council and \r\nits implementation mechanism and pursuant to relevant \r\nresolutions of the Security Council (see A/67/PV.9). \r\nI said then that Iran was hampering that process. It \r\nwas training Houthi militias and providing them with \r\nweapons, delivered by boat or by other vessels, in order \r\nto impose the Iranian model in Yemen.\r\nBetween that time three years ago and today, \r\nwe have worked tirelessly on a peaceful political \r\ntransition aimed at preparing the broad, year-long \r\nnational dialogue, bringing together all the political \r\nforces of Yemen and setting an honourable precedent \r\n15-29437 25/26\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.17\r\nin our country and the region. That was followed by a \r\ntransparent process for drafting a secular, democratic \r\nmodern constitution. The Assembly followed the \r\npolitical time lines and dates as they arose and provided \r\ndirect support. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also \r\nprovided direct support and visited our country. All \r\nelements of Yemeni society, including the Houthis, \r\nwere part of the process. In addition, there have been \r\nvisits by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General \r\nand the Security Council, as well as the adoption of \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions and presidential \r\nstatements.\r\nDespite all that, as the political transition process \r\nwas drawing to a close and just when the constitution \r\nwas supposed to be submitted to a popular referendum, \r\nthe Houthis and Saleh staged a military and political \r\ncoup d’état, occupying the capital, Sana’a, and wreaking \r\nhavoc on hospitals, mosques, Quranic schools, homes \r\nand residences. Every form of weaponry was used, \r\nincluding arms from the Yemeni army. The tragedies \r\nin Aden, Taiz and Ad Dali could be characterized as \r\ngenocide. Indeed, it was a desperate attempt to impose \r\nthe Iranian model through the use of force. Political \r\nleaders and thousands of citizens either disappeared or \r\nwere killed. The media were also affected. Thousands \r\nof children were forcibly conscripted, anti-personnel \r\nmines were planted and schools, public buildings and \r\nhomes were converted into weapons storage facilities \r\nand barracks. Houthi militia threatened to spread to \r\nneighbouring countries, thereby endangering regional \r\nand international peace and security.\r\nWe attempted to have a dialogue with Saleh \r\nand the Houthis, giving them immunity and every \r\nopportunity and including them in national dialogue, \r\nbut they retained their weapons and refused to create a \r\npolitical party in accordance with established law. That \r\nwas all accepted despite the events that took place in \r\n2004. Saleh’s fight has never been a peaceful one, as \r\nwas, for example, the peaceful southern movement, in \r\nSa’dah province, which saw its citizens expelled. The \r\nHouthis seized military areas and took control by force. \r\nDespite our positive approach to that armed movement \r\nand various understandings with the Houthi movement, \r\nagreements were repeatedly cast aside and a coup d’état \r\nwas carried out against the State, and people were \r\nmaltreated and severely punished.\r\nThe actions of the Houthi militias, as well as those \r\nof Saleh, led us to appeal to neighbouring countries in \r\nthe Gulf under Article 51 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We appealed for assistance in tackling the \r\nHouthi militias that were undermining and threatening \r\nnational legitimacy. The response was courageous. Our \r\nbrother His Majesty Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, \r\nof the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, acted with utter \r\ndetermination. On behalf of the Yemeni people, I would \r\nlike to convey our sincere thanks to His Majesty King \r\nSalman and to all members of the coalition who are \r\npursuing efforts to assist the Yemeni people. We are \r\njoined together in blood in this battle for our country \r\nand for the legitimacy of the State in order to prevent \r\nthe country from falling into the hands of Iran, which \r\nwould like to see the destruction of the country and to \r\ncontrol the Bab al-Mandab strait.\r\nThe Yemeni people have opposed attempts by the \r\nHouthis in Aden, Abyan, Al-Baydhah, Taiz, Hodeidah \r\nand other cities of Yemen. The people have upheld the \r\nlaw. I would like to commend the efforts of the brave \r\nnational resistance and the national armed forces, who \r\nare indeed our partners in struggle and in victory, \r\nconstruction and development. The Assembly is aware \r\nof the human tragedy that has befallen our people as a \r\nresult of the blockade imposed by the militias, which \r\ncontinue their coup d’état. The Assembly is also aware \r\nof the deterioration and destruction of public services \r\nin liberated provinces. Greater international effort is \r\nneeded to alleviate the human suffering and to ensure \r\nthat the Yemeni crisis is not forgotten. While the United \r\nNations has announced an appeal for humanitarian \r\nassistance for Yemen, annual contributions continue to \r\nfall short and cover only a meagre portion of the actual \r\nneed.\r\nI therefore take this opportunity to appeal once again \r\nto donor countries to ensure that they provide promised \r\nassistance. The Government of the Republic of Yemen \r\nwould like to see the arrival of emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance to provide for all provinces without exception. \r\nAn oversight mechanism for humanitarian convoys, as \r\nproposed by the United Nations, would allow for the \r\nreturn of economic prosperity and would facilitate the \r\narrival of humanitarian assistance through all Yemeni \r\nports. Furthermore, the Government has been moved \r\nto Aden. I believe that that will lead to better living \r\nconditions for our citizens. It will also re-establish basic \r\nservices, which have been destroyed by the militias of \r\nthe Houthis and Saleh.\r\nWithout a doubt, and quite clearly, that remains the \r\nbest way for me to remain side by side with my heroic \r\nand steadfast people. That has been our position since \r\n26/26 15-29437\r\nA/70/PV.17 29/09/2015\r\nthe very beginning of the conflict. We have cooperated \r\nwith all genuine efforts on the part of the international \r\ncommunity and, in particular, with those of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh \r\nAhmed, the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General, \r\nto end the coup d’état, pursuant to Security Council \r\nresolution 2216 (2015). Since that resolution, the \r\npolitical process has been resumed, guided by the \r\nresults of the national dialogue and facilitated by the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council.\r\nAllow me to reiterate that all efforts to achieve \r\na peaceful settlement of the political crisis should be \r\nwelcomed and supported. Once again, I would like \r\nto convey to the rebels, the Houthi-Saleh militias, \r\nthat they must lay down their weapons, act in line \r\nwith reason and implement resolution 2216 (2015) in \r\nearnest. I have come here to support peace and accord. \r\nI am talking not about a divisive peace but rather of \r\na permanent peace that will be a source of law and \r\norder, cohesion and justice. Allow me to advocate for \r\nthe literal implementation of the most recent Security \r\nCouncil resolution, namely, resolution 2216 (2015), \r\nwhich bears the credibility of the Council itself. I hope \r\nthat the efforts of the United Nations will be crowned \r\nwith success. That will ensure that we act in accordance \r\nwith the aspirations of our people, who have been \r\nexceedingly patient and sincere.\r\nTerrorism represents a real threat to States. To the \r\nextent of our ability, we have tried to combat terrorism, \r\nagainst which we have conducted a determined \r\ncampaign, in partnership with friendly countries. The \r\ncoup d’état and the extremism that ensued created \r\na breeding ground for terrorism. I would like to \r\nreiterate, however, our confidence in and support for \r\nthe Government, which is leading the fight against \r\nterrorism with international aid. Given the geographical \r\nand strategic location of Yemen, the stability of our \r\ncountry buttresses the stability of the region and the \r\nworld.\r\nThe seventieth session of the General Assembly \r\ncoincides with the glorious September and October \r\nrevolutions of my country. I would like to express my \r\nthanks and gratitude to all the Yemeni people, who \r\nare a proud and patient people. I would like to restate \r\nmy commitment to achieving the goals of those two \r\nglorious revolutions. We will not allow minority groups, \r\nHouthis or others, to repeat the Iranian experience in \r\nYemen. At this time, 70 years since the birth of the \r\nUnited Nations, an Organization that has succeeded in \r\nlessening conflicts and wars through its very principles, \r\nwe reiterate our commitment to working on behalf of \r\nfuture generations. That represents a commitment to \r\nthose generations, as well as a commitment to making \r\nthe world more prosperous, safer and free through unity \r\nand true determination to achieve the noble ambitions, \r\non which our Organization was established.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen condemns in the strongest \r\nterms the systematic Israeli attacks against the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque. Once again, we express our permanent support \r\nfor the Palestinian people, who are determined to protect \r\nthe Mosque. A question necessarily arises regarding \r\nthose recent events. A Government that was created by \r\nresolutions of the Security Council refuses to abide by \r\nthose same resolutions. That is truly surprising.\r\nI would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his important efforts to achieve the noble \r\nambition of our Organization to ensure international \r\npeace and security. I would also like to thank him \r\nfor his great and commendable efforts to promote the \r\npolitical transition in Yemen, reverse the coup d’état \r\nand restore State authority. We wish every success to \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
