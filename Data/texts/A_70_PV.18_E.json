Jammeh Babil \r\nMansa, President of the Republic of the Gambia, who \r\nhas also directed me to read out his statement on his \r\nbehalf, as follows.\r\n“I wish to first and foremost praise the Almighty \r\nAllah for granting me this opportunity to once \r\nagain be part of this 2015 General Assembly with \r\nleaders from around the globe. I also pray to the \r\nAlmighty Allah to guide us throughout this session \r\nand provide us with the necessary wisdom, courage \r\nand blessing for the fulfilment of our objectives.\r\n“But before speaking any further, please allow \r\nme to first extend my warmest congratulations \r\nto Mr. Mogens Lykketoft in his new position as \r\nthe elected President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session and to further wish him all \r\nthe best in his official endeavours throughout his \r\ntenure. The entire Gambian delegation and I are \r\npleased to support his presidency during the course \r\nof these deliberations. By being entrusted with \r\nsuch a special responsibility, it is fair to say that \r\nthe world has, in a position of consensus, identified \r\nhis exemplary qualities and abilities as the perfect \r\nperson to oversee the current global agenda for the \r\nbuilding of a more caring world free of war ravages \r\nand underdevelopment.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\n“I also wish, on behalf of my delegation and \r\non my own behalf, to convey my special thanks \r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, for \r\nhis remarkable performance during his tenure in \r\noffice. We are very proud of him and will continue \r\nto wish him the best and give him all our support in \r\nhis future undertakings.\r\n“Last but not least, I wish to register our special \r\ncommendation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nand members of his entire supporting team who, \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.18\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n18th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 29 September 2015, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\ndespite difficult challenges, continue to perform \r\ntheir duties with notable success.\r\n“There has never been a moment better than \r\nthis for our Organization collectively to reflect and \r\nresolve to respond with a special sense of urgency \r\nto the increasing complexities of global challenges \r\nthat threaten to derail hundreds of years of peace, \r\nprogress and prosperity for humankind. It is \r\ntherefore imperative that, as an agent of change, the \r\nUnited Nations not fail to account for and cement \r\nthe implementation of critical resolutions designed \r\nto assist our Member nations and, indeed, the entire \r\nuniverse for the improvement and sustainment of a \r\nbetter quality of life for all.\r\n“In order to effectively achieve the goals \r\nset forth by this world body for the stability and \r\nmaintenance of world peace, all Member States, be \r\nthey big or small, must be promptly and strongly \r\nreprimanded or censured for violations that are \r\nin direct conflict with the United Nations 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\n“I remain firm in my constant recommendation \r\nfor the whole world to stand together against the \r\ncontinued barbarism and brutality of indiscriminate \r\nterrorism perpetrated against innocent men, women \r\nand children, causing undue suffering and losses \r\nthat often render the victims helpless, homeless \r\nand hopeless. As genuine Muslims worshipping the \r\nAlmighty Allah, whose message in the Holy Koran \r\nrepeatedly draws our attention to the need to live \r\ntogether in peace for our common humanity, we the \r\nmajority must not remain indifferent or silent with \r\nrespect to those particularly sadistic sons of Satan \r\nwho are committed to desecrating Islam itself with \r\nonly one objective and inclination — to wreak \r\nhavoc on their fellow human beings.\r\n“Let me say again as I have said in this forum \r\nand many others elsewhere that the propaganda and \r\npropagation of these Satanic ideologies are not only \r\na fraudulent misrepresentation of Islam — a noble \r\nreligion indeed — and a mockery of democratic \r\nideals, but an insult to the Almighty Allah himself, \r\nmaking it ever more necessary to nullify their \r\nexistence by all means possible. Their baseless \r\nclaims and increasing attacks on peaceful regions \r\nrequire the United Nations in particular to come \r\ntogether to exterminate these barbaric monsters, as \r\nthey have no regard for the sanctity of human life \r\nin the first place.\r\n“Countries that are caught at the crossroads \r\nand are embroiled in conflicts with terrorism \r\ndeserve our unfettered and unmitigated support. I \r\ntherefore call upon Member nations to fully commit \r\nto the Organization’s basic tenets regarding the \r\nsolidification of enduring solutions that protect and \r\nsustain all human life. As true Muslims and Allah-\r\nworshipping people, we must understand that these \r\nare unconscionable acts that should be subjected to \r\nthe toughest penalties.\r\n“In recognition of the need for world peace, \r\nmy Government respects the recent landmark \r\nagreement on the Iran nuclear issue, outlined in \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in which \r\nIran has agreed — along with the United States of \r\nAmerica, Russia, China and Germany — to limit its \r\nnuclear programme as specified. My Government \r\nbelieves that it is an important achievement with \r\nthe right measures, particularly if they are put in \r\nplace, for monitoring and accountability purposes.\r\n“While we welcome the Iranian agreement \r\nto curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons, \r\nthe need remains to address perennial conflicts \r\nwith a high human cost to our youth, women and \r\nchildren, and to defuse persistently tense situations \r\nwith high potential for escalation into a nuclear \r\nconflagration. I therefore call upon this global \r\ninstitution and regional organizations charged \r\nwith the responsibility of conflict resolution, \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding to firm up our \r\ncommitment to international peace and security. \r\nThat is imperative in order to end the dangerously \r\nescalating acts of violence, terrorism and banditry \r\nin simmering trouble spots the world over.\r\n“The continuation of these conflicts calls \r\ninto question the efficacy of the United Nations \r\nin executing the principal function for which it \r\nwas first created. Paradoxically, however, their \r\npersistence constitutes highly valued gains for \r\nsome unscrupulous enemies of peace, as the \r\nbelligerents and opposing factions are supported \r\nby States, entities and individuals for geopolitical, \r\neconomic and military strategic interests based on \r\ngreed and hatred for the rest of humankind.\r\n“I would also urge that the United Nations \r\naddress the post-Ebola 2014 virus epidemic, which \r\n15-29595 3/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nclaimed and maimed thousands of lives, mostly in \r\nthe hardest-hit West African subregion. While the \r\nsizeable monetary, medical personnel and supply \r\ncontributions had a huge impact on its containment \r\nand treatment, there are invariably vast rippling \r\neffects for almost the entire continent. The slow \r\nreaction times for response efforts, human fear \r\nand media reports have had a wide-scale negative \r\neconomic impact on a large number of countries. \r\nAs a result of continued reductions in trade and \r\nforeign investment, border closures and f light \r\ncancellations, the United Nations Development \r\nGroup has projected that West Africa stands to lose \r\nmore than $3.6 billion annually over the next three \r\nyears. As the virus still poses a threat to the world, \r\nthere are a number of solutions that the United \r\nNations could support to contain and prevent the \r\ndisease from re-emerging and spreading.\r\n“Critical among such approaches is the need \r\nto invest in awareness campaigns, education and \r\nvaccinations to ensure the safety and security of \r\nthe whole world community. Obviously, we cannot \r\nbut continue to express our sincere appreciation for \r\nthe timely and effective intervention of the Cuban \r\nGovernment, the Russian Federation and the United \r\nStates Government, whose rapid deployment of the \r\nnecessary logistics, including medical teams, to the \r\nworst-affected areas helped immensely in stopping \r\nthe spread of the disease.\r\n“Despite persisting challenges, Africa and \r\nthe Gambia continue to make effective gains in \r\nachieving many aspects of the 2015 Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. To begin with, protecting our \r\nenvironment must emphatically remain a major \r\npriority for this global body because registered \r\nclimate changes over the course of history have \r\nsignificantly impacted negatively on our planet \r\nEarth and demand our immediate and permanent \r\nattention. The planet is, after all, our only home, \r\nwhich we must passionately protect for the benefit \r\nof present and future generations.\r\n“That, in essence, demands from all of us \r\nthe steadfastness to soundly manage our natural \r\nresources for both economic and social development. \r\nWe can no longer continue to pretend not to know or \r\nlive in denial of the challenges faced by humankind \r\nfrom the adverse impact of the depletion of our \r\nnatural resources, as manifest today in the form \r\nof desertification, drought, land degradation and \r\nocean acidification though activities of State-owned \r\nand multinational companies, mostly from the West \r\nand the developed world.\r\n“This body must act with greater commitment \r\nand resolve to establish sustainable conservation \r\nprogrammes, with production patterns aimed at \r\neffectively combating climate change, restorating \r\nour ecosystems, promoting forest management and \r\nreversing desertification and land degradation. \r\nIt is also the obligation of the United Nations to \r\nbe resilient in ensuring the reduction of the risks \r\nof man-made disasters that often cause massive \r\npollution to our seas, oceans and fresh water \r\nsources.\r\n“Therefore, my Government continues to \r\nreiterate the significance of how Security Council \r\nreform bears on the global interests of all Member \r\nStates and the enduring interests of the Organization \r\nas well. As clearly articulated in decision 62/557 \r\nadopted by a consensus of Member States, we, \r\nthe stakeholders, all support the laudable idea that \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform should be driven by Member States \r\nthemselves and that the positions of Member States \r\nshould form the foundation of the negotiations in \r\nthe first instance.\r\n“We are, however, yet to realize a reflection \r\nof such principles and consensus in the Council’s \r\ngeneral approach and framework document. In \r\norder for the Security Council’s multifaceted \r\nreform to realize its desired objective of increased \r\nefficiency and effective representation in an \r\natmosphere governed by democratic working \r\nmethods, top priority should be given to increasing \r\nthe representation of African countries in particular, \r\nwhich will provide us with better opportunities \r\nto participate in the Council’s decision-making \r\nprocess.\r\n“We must bear in mind that African nations \r\nrepresent more than 1 billion people in this body \r\nand constitute 54 sovereign States here, making \r\nit ever more important and more qualified for \r\nthe allocation of the two permanent and two \r\nnon-permanent seats that Africa rightly deserves. \r\nBut our calls have never heeded despite persistent \r\nappeals, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nand Sirte Declaration, among others.\r\n4/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\n“It has been 15 years since 2000 and the initial \r\ndevelopment of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, and, though progress in various degrees has \r\nbeen accomplished among Member States, with \r\nbroader, more reliable and sustainable goals we \r\nmust continue to build on proposed motions so as \r\nto ensure the real achievement of the goals that we \r\nset for ourselves.\r\n“Despite the marked evolution in human \r\ndiversity, there are some tenets with respect to \r\npeople’s religious beliefs and values that are sacred \r\nand no country, big or small, should be allowed to \r\ninsult another country or bully it for honouring the \r\ntraditions that govern its people. To do so is both \r\ndisrespectful and dangerous. Whereas materialism, \r\nterrorism, crime, obsession with weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, and deviant lifestyles seem to be the \r\norder of the day, we must make no mistake that \r\nthere are still right and wrong deeds, and positive \r\nand negative consequences. As much as some \r\nbehaviours are clearly in violation of laws and \r\nsocietal norms, there are others that are a direct \r\ninsult to our respective religions. I maintain that all \r\nof the aforementioned behaviours are displeasing \r\nto the Almighty Allah and against the principles \r\nthat govern peaceful and loving Muslims and \r\nChristians alike.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\n“For 70 years since the founding of the United \r\nNations, the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights has continued to maintain the same language \r\nas the mainstay of literally every United Nations \r\nresolution and conference that has to do with the \r\nfamily, namely, that the family is the natural and \r\nfundamental group unit of society. So that spirit has \r\nexcluded and still should exclude any international \r\nacknowledgement of relationships between persons \r\nof the same sex to signify a family, as in the case \r\nof homosexual civil unions and so-called same-sex \r\nmarriages. Therefore given the natural structure \r\nof human nature and society, we must not allow \r\nourselves to depart from the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights norm by entertaining deviant \r\nbeliefs that reduce the family to Government \r\napproval of adult sexual and emotional desires, \r\ninstead of recognizing them as central agents to \r\nachieve the common good of spouses, children and \r\nsociety at large.\r\n“I wish to shift attention to the great continent \r\nof Africa, whose human and vast natural resources \r\nhave always been the target of trespassers who have \r\ntrampled our economic, social, political, and human \r\nrights. Although there has been a steep learning \r\ncurve with regard to becoming self-sufficient, there \r\nhas always been and will always persist a desire for \r\nAfrica to remain forever independent of colonial \r\nrule and subjugation.\r\n“In fact, my Government and other States have \r\nmade an iron-clad promise to our citizens that this \r\nis our time and our era. It is time for Africa to reap \r\nthe benefit of its divine inheritance. It is time for \r\nAfrica to dispel the myths and falsehoods about \r\nits history and people. It is time for Africa to stop \r\npeople from taking advantage of our glorious and \r\nrich natural resources, and to stand up for what \r\nit believes in, what it is interested in and what \r\nis better for its people. No longer will we as a \r\ncontinent be robbed of our very means to progress \r\nand prosperity.\r\n“It is heartbreaking to live with the sad reality \r\nthat the United Nations cannot gain much traction \r\nin arresting the state of incessant violence in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories, which is evident \r\nas a result of the continuing policy of settlement \r\nexpansion and the climate of impunity relating to \r\nthe activities of the settlers. Although there is an \r\noverwhelming increase in the number of areas of \r\nconflict in the Middle East, which in many ways \r\nhas impacted the priorities of the United Nations \r\nthere, our attention must never be distracted from \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people. Their right \r\nto a State with secure borders and East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital will not be compromised. This long \r\noverdue exigency, which is backed by myriad \r\nUnited Nations resolutions — not least, the recent \r\nresolution 66/225, of 29 March 2012 — continues \r\nto be my Government’s position on this particular \r\nissue.\r\n“The fight against drug and human trafficking \r\nshould be seen as linked to international security \r\nbecause it is a serious threat to all societies. We \r\nknow that the use and sale of drugs are deeply rooted \r\nin violence and organized crime. We also know \r\nthat drug trafficking is linked to terrorist activities \r\nand other crimes, including money-laundering and \r\nthe sale and trade of arms. Wide-scale corruption \r\nexists within organized groups with pervasive \r\n15-29595 5/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\ncriminal mindsets. Therefore, the inherent threats \r\nof drug trafficking and its related problems require \r\nurgent action on the part of this international body.\r\n“At the current rate, drug trafficking is \r\nlikely to become an epidemic that no country can \r\nescape because it is steadily rising to become a \r\nborderless threat. I therefore strongly urge that we \r\napproach this threat much more aggressively, with \r\na comprehensive plan that involves accountability, \r\nfull international commitment and support. \r\nMoreover, not just tougher laws and penalties \r\nare necessary; critical efforts are also vital to \r\ncontaining the spread of the use of drugs, as is \r\nthe need for adequate rehabilitation measures for \r\nenduring solutions.\r\n“I must underscore my Government’s gratitude \r\nto the Russian Federation for sponsoring the \r\nMoscow-Africa Anti-Drug Dialogue, held in the \r\nGambia on 23 July with the objective of mapping \r\nout the best means of approaching the hazard in the \r\nAfrican continent and the world over. The meeting \r\nwas a resounding success, and once again I stand \r\nto sincerely extol the special part played by the \r\nleaders and Government of Russia for a job well \r\ndone.\r\n“In conclusion, at the forefront of our agenda \r\nwe should aggressively discuss how we can cope \r\nwith the evolution of enduring issues that coexist \r\nin our societies, such as trespassers and pillagers \r\non free soil, willing to take what does not rightly \r\nbelong to them. For centuries, the African \r\ncontinent remained the target of intrusion, theft \r\nand enslavement by foreign Powers. Nevertheless, \r\nincreased terrorism threats, hunger, poverty, crime \r\nand disease continue to expand faster than our \r\nintelligence, resources and might. Global peace, \r\nit would therefore seem, depends on our efforts to \r\ntake corrective measures against rampant injustice.\r\n“It is with this serious concern in mind that \r\nI suggest that, on the basis of the brutality and \r\ninhumanity of the slave trade, the lingering \r\ninfluences and effects of colonialism, the pervasive \r\ndestruction of human capital, and the theft of native \r\nAfrican resources that are often rare and existing \r\nonly on that extraordinarily diverse continent, this \r\nOrganization should now consider remitting an \r\ninvoice of reparations to the entire world and made \r\npayable to the sovereign Governments of Africa.\r\n“But Members should know that such action \r\nalone is not enough to compensate for the untold \r\nloss of life, limb, talent and resources that are \r\nvital for Africa to become a more developed and \r\nsustainable nation. It would, rather, amount to a \r\nfairly acceptable gesture of restoration and justice \r\nfor what Africa cannot reclaim.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia for the statement she has just \r\nmade.\r\nMs. Aja Isatou Njie-Saidy, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Gambia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Thailand.\r\nMr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Thailand, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Chan-o-cha (Thailand) (spoke in Thai; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): On behalf \r\nof the Royal Thai Government, I should like to join \r\nother leaders in expressing my warm congratulations \r\nto the United Nations on the occasion of its seventieth \r\nanniversary.\r\nI wish to sincerely thank all countries for their \r\nexpressions of condolence and solidarity in the \r\naftermath of the bombing in Bangkok on 17 August. \r\nThailand strongly condemns this barbaric act, which \r\ntook the lives of many innocent civilians. We will \r\nnever condone such violence. Let me therefore pledge \r\nour firm and unwavering determination to work with \r\nall countries to uphold peace and stability everywhere.\r\nDuring the past 70 years, the United Nations has \r\nmade significant contributions to alleviating the plight \r\nand problems of peoples in all four corners of the \r\nglobe, playing a pivotal role in maintaining peace and \r\nsecurity, protecting and promoting human rights and \r\nadvancing the welfare and well-being of all humankind. \r\n6/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nIn the area of peacekeeping, the United Nations has \r\nbeen recognized for its success in preventing armed \r\nconflicts from escalating into war. Nevertheless, the \r\nUnited Nations remains duty-bound to shoulder a heavy \r\nhumanitarian burden and build sustainable peace, which \r\nmeans continuing to carry out development work and \r\nassisting people on the ground. Thailand is determined \r\nto provide support to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, especially in the area of development.\r\nIn the area of human rights Thailand has always \r\naccorded priority to protecting and promoting the \r\nhuman rights of all groups of people. We proudly \r\nserved as a member of the Human Rights Council from \r\n2010 to 2013 and as its Chair from 2010 to 2011. During \r\nour tenure we advocated ourselves as a bridge-builder \r\namong nations and groups of nations with diverging \r\nviews and ideologies. We uphold the principle of \r\nnon-discrimination and constructive partnerships, as \r\nwell as capacity-building of individual nations in their \r\nhuman rights promotion and protection efforts.\r\nIn the area of development, the United Nations \r\ndeserves credit for bringing progress and prosperity to \r\nall Member States. Thailand is proud to be a part of \r\nthis transformative world agenda, which places people \r\nat the centre of development in order to eradicate \r\npoverty, reduce inequalities, ensure universal health \r\nand well-being, promote good governance and the rule \r\nof law, and reduce disaster risks. Climate change will \r\npose a major challenge to the achievement of various \r\nSustainable Development Goals. It is therefore our \r\nshared responsibility to ensure that the outcome of the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange will be both ambitious and viable.\r\nWe live in a borderless world marked by a complex \r\ninterlinkage of problems, and solving them will require \r\na comprehensive approach because we cannot rely on \r\na one-size-fits-all solution. And since each country’s \r\ncircumstances are different, there ought to be different \r\napproaches to addressing common global challenges. \r\nToday, close international cooperation and enhanced \r\npartnerships are indispensable to tackling the problem \r\nof irregular migration, especially persons displaced by \r\nconflict, which has created protracted humanitarian \r\ncrises in many parts of the world. Thailand is also \r\nfacing this challenge, and we reaffirm our commitment \r\nto work closely with all to address this pressing issue.\r\nThe United Nations at 70 has a commendable track \r\nrecord in the maintenance of peace and security and \r\nthe prevention of human rights abuses. Nevertheless, \r\nnumerous challenges remain and require a holistic \r\napproach, focusing especially on the development \r\ndimension. The imperative now is to focus on crafting a \r\ntruly sustainable solution to peace and security, taking \r\ninto account the nexus of development and human \r\nrights.\r\nThailand’s socioeconomic success of the past \r\nthree decades, its ascent to the rank of middle-income \r\ncountry, and its status as a partner for development, owes \r\na great deal to the sufficiency economy philosophy of \r\nHis Majesty the King of Thailand. Thailand’s approach \r\nto development takes inspiration from His Majesty \r\nthe King’s sufficiency economy philosophy, which \r\nespouses moderation, prudence and resilience. It teaches \r\npeople to be moral, wise and self-reliant and to live \r\nmodestly and in harmony with society and nature. This \r\npeople-centred development is indeed consonant with \r\nthe United Nations new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). His Majesty the King’s \r\nsufficiency economy philosophy has been recognized \r\ninternationally. In 2006, His Majesty the King was \r\nawarded the United Nations Development Programme \r\nHuman Development Lifetime Achievement Award.\r\nThe strategy underpinning my Government’s \r\napproach to national development inspired by His \r\nMajesty the King’s philosophy is to make the country \r\nstable, prosperous and sustainable. The goals include \r\nreducing disparity and inequality, promoting the rule \r\nof law and good governance, fostering national unity, \r\nenhancing economic connectivity with our neighbours \r\nand pursuing development that would not compromise \r\nthe ability of future generations to meet their own \r\nneeds.\r\nSecurity and stability, allowing people to live free \r\nfrom fear and free from want, are top priorities for my \r\ncountry, and it is my conviction that Thailand will be \r\nstable only when we have developed ourselves into a \r\nnation of virtuous, competent and enlightened citizens \r\nwho live their lives responsibly and for the greater good. \r\nThe Government has a role to play in the promotion of \r\nsuch a society, in which individuals actively take part \r\nin building a stronger and better future for themselves \r\nand for the community so that they can be resilient \r\nenough to cope with future challenges.\r\nClimate change is a major challenge, and all \r\ncountries must cooperate to manage the challenge it \r\nposes. Thailand reaffirms its commitment to reducing \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions by between 20 and 25 per \r\n15-29595 7/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\ncent by the year 2030, in line with our commitment \r\nunder the intended nationally determined contributions. \r\nFurthermore, sustainability can be achieved only when \r\nwe put in place a framework of fair rules for all and \r\npromote good governance that in turn leads to greater \r\ntransparency and accountability. We will stress joint \r\nownership and the collective efforts of all across all \r\nsectors because people are the main agents of change, \r\nand that change must begin from within.\r\nThailand is therefore undertaking comprehensive \r\nreforms on several fronts to make our country stronger \r\nand better in the hope that we will achieve security, \r\nprosperity and sustainability, and pave the way towards \r\nresilient democracy. Some of these major reforms \r\ninclude amending laws and strengthening the justice \r\nsystem, and improving public-sector efficiency. What \r\nwe do today will become history tomorrow. Therefore, \r\nwe must make the best of today so that 10 or 20 years \r\nfrom now we will be remembered for our actions. We \r\nwant Thailand to be stronger and better and to become \r\nmore actively involved in the work of the United Nations \r\nto shape a brighter future for us all.\r\nWe often expect the strongest to help the weakest \r\nand the most vulnerable, but given the widening gap \r\nbetween the strongest and the weakest we must not \r\noverlook what those in the middle can do. This middle \r\ngroup of countries actually constitutes the majority. \r\nThey may be strong enough to stand on their own feet \r\nwhile still remaining in touch with the instructive \r\nexperiences of their growth and development. Therefore \r\nthey can serve as a crucial link between the strongest \r\nand the weakest.\r\nAs a middle-income country, Thailand firmly \r\nbelieves that development cannot be truly sustainable \r\nwhen some countries forge ahead and leave others \r\nbehind. That is why we have pursued the “Thailand-\r\nPlus-One” policy for all-inclusive, region-wide \r\neconomic and industrial development, so that our \r\nneighbours can advance alongside us. This includes \r\nprojects of transport connectivity and the creation of \r\nspecial economic zones along our borders with our \r\nneighbours in support of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations.\r\nAt present, the majority of people in developing \r\ncountries are in the agricultural sector. They currently \r\nface a host of challenges, such as trade barriers, \r\ncompetition on the world market, climate change, \r\ndebt, poverty and a diminishing workforce. All these \r\nchallenges put the world’s food security at risk. \r\nTherefore, we must join hands to help developing \r\ncountries, particularly through North-South and South-\r\nSouth cooperation and by strengthening the agricultural \r\nsector.\r\nAside from looking after our farmers, we must \r\nalso empower other vulnerable groups, such as women, \r\nchildren and the disabled, and those at risk of having \r\ntheir human rights violated and becoming victims of \r\nhuman trafficking, such as workers in the fisheries \r\nsector. The Thai Government accords priority to solving \r\nthe problem of human trafficking because it is a serious \r\nviolation of human rights and necessitates humanitarian \r\nassistance. The comprehensive efforts that we are now \r\nundertaking in the areas of prevention, suppression and \r\nrehabilitation will contribute to regional and global \r\nefforts to tackle this problem.\r\nAs regards other major transnational challenges, \r\nsuch as pandemics and drug trafficking, these are \r\nissues that require enhanced international cooperation. \r\nThailand stands ready to share our experiences and \r\nbest practices in areas where we have expertise, \r\nnamely universal health coverage, infectious disease \r\nsurveillance and sustainable alternative development. \r\nIn a few months, we will be organizing the second \r\nHigh-Level International Conference on Alternative \r\nDevelopment.\r\nThailand attaches importance to building a culture \r\nof peace. We have also actively participated in the \r\ninternational efforts to address global challenges. It is \r\nfor these reasons that Thailand has decided to run for \r\na non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2017-2018. We believe that we can constructively \r\nserve as a bridge-builder among Security Council \r\nmembers and non-members. We believe that we can play \r\na constructive role in bridging different cultures and \r\nbeliefs. In undertaking this important responsibility, \r\nwe hope to be able to promote good understanding and \r\nenhance international cooperation in our collective \r\nendeavour to achieve the common goals of the United \r\nNations.\r\nAs we enter a new era of development, the concept \r\nof sustainability should be integrated into all three \r\npillars of the United Nations work. We have been \r\nemphasizing for decades how these three pillars are \r\nmutually reinforcing, but in reality we have been taking \r\nsomewhat of a silo approach to peace and security, to \r\ndevelopment and to human rights. It is time to change all \r\nthat. Now is the time to converge all three paths so that \r\nthe road ahead for humanity in the next 70 years will be \r\n8/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\none of promises fulfilled, of visions transformed. Let \r\nus make it happen together now and let us turn our road \r\ninto one that makes a difference.\r\nIt is our firm conviction that together we, the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations, hold the power \r\nto change the world for the better. I hereby reaffirm \r\nThailand’s readiness to partner with all Member States \r\nin our continuing efforts to address both traditional and \r\nnon-traditional challenges. We are indeed united in our \r\naspiration to make the United Nations a true beacon of \r\nhope for humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, National \r\nSecurity, Grenadines and Legal Affairs of \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, National Security, Grenadines and Legal \r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, National Security, Grenadines and Legal \r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, National Security, \r\nGrenadines and Legal Affairs of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nIn the Christian Bible, the Book of Proverbs suggests \r\nthat mortal men live for threescore and ten years, a \r\nnumber that fairly accurately reflects the current modal \r\nlife expectancy of the global population. Today we \r\nhave assembled for the seventieth time in the life of the \r\nUnited Nations with the legitimate question of whether \r\nthis imperfect assembly of mortals has seen its best \r\ndays, or if, by reason of the strength of our principles \r\nand actions, we may endure to overcome tomorrow’s \r\nchallenges.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines looks forward \r\nto the wise and experienced stewardship of President \r\nMogens Lykketoft during this seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. President Lykketoft, who will \r\ncelebrate his seventieth birthday during his tenure, can \r\nconfidently stand on the exceptional works performed \r\nby His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa during last year’s \r\nsession.\r\nThis year, possibly more than at any point in our \r\nmodern history, our Assembly is beset by global threats \r\nand risks that force us to consider the ways in which our \r\ncore principles of sovereignty and non-interference can \r\novercome today’s challenges. Borderless menaces such \r\nas terrorism, economic crises, contagious diseases and \r\nclimate change heed neither geopolitical boundaries nor \r\ngovernmental jurisdiction. Furthermore, the calamitous \r\nfallout of military adventurism, economic recklessness \r\nor environmental negligence is not confined to discrete \r\nnational boundaries. Rather, the chickens often return \r\nto roost in far-f lung, unexpected and often blameless \r\nlocales. As such, more than ever our international \r\nrelations must be defined by cooperation, collaboration \r\nand decisive action.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is a small, \r\nmountainous archipelago of 32 islands scattered across \r\na shimmering Caribbean sea. But the idyll implicit in \r\nour verdant peaks and crystal waters is now belied by \r\nthe grave and gathering threat of climate change. Rising \r\nand raging seas attack our coastline and infrastructure \r\nfrom beyond our shores, while rains and climate \r\nvolatility make landslides and deadly f looding a real \r\nand increasingly frequent internal threat to lives and \r\nlivelihoods. \r\nThe intensifying vulnerability of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines and its neighbouring islands to climate \r\nchange is clear in the alternating bouts of drought and \r\nf looding that have caused hundreds of millions of \r\ndollars in loss and damage in my country in successive \r\nyears. Less than two years ago, devastating f loods \r\nwashed away 17 per cent of our fragile gross domestic \r\nproduct and claimed 12 lives. Our quest to recover and \r\nto make our people whole again is a continuing struggle \r\nand one that takes place against a backdrop of hope that \r\nwe are not soon beset by a similar tragedy.\r\nOne month ago, tropical storm Erika struck our \r\nsister island of Dominica, a mere 150 miles north of our \r\n15-29595 9/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\ncountry. The death and destruction wrought by the storm \r\nare heartrending and serve as yet another unwanted \r\nreminder of the ominous threat of global warming and \r\nthe precarious nature of our developmental aspirations \r\nin the face of an increasingly inhospitable climate. \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines and other Caribbean \r\ncountries have joined friendly nations in assisting the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica in its hour of need. I \r\nbeseech other countries that have not yet supported this \r\nnoble effort of relief, recovery and reconstruction to do \r\nso with the utmost urgency and generosity.\r\nOur existential struggles in the face of climate \r\nchange inform our posture in the frustratingly \r\nmeandering negotiations to arrive at a legally binding \r\nagreement within the parameters of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We are \r\ntwo months away from a deadline for reaching such an \r\nagreement at the twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Convention (COP21) in Paris, but \r\nthe precariousness of our global plight is not matched \r\nby the ambition of our partners. Indeed, the posturing \r\nand recalcitrance of some major emitters suggest that \r\nCOP21 may be yet another empty diplomatic dance that \r\nprioritizes process over progress.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is embracing a \r\ngreen future. We are actively engaged in transitioning \r\nfrom fossil fuels to a renewable mix of solar, hydro and \r\ngeothermal energy. Within the next three years, more \r\nthan 80 per cent of our electricity needs will be provided \r\nby renewable energy. If we could control our climate \r\ndestiny and insulate ourselves from the recklessness \r\nof other emitters, we would approach the future with \r\ngreater confidence.\r\nThe aftershocks and repercussions of the global \r\neconomic and financial crisis continue to convulse \r\ndeveloping nations. The crisis casts a shadow on \r\nour collective efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and shrouds our newly adopted \r\nSustainable Development Goals in uncertainty. The \r\nmeasure of our recovery is not the health of corporations \r\nor the rate of jobless economic growth, but the ways in \r\nwhich we have reformed our financial architecture and \r\nthe reordering of priorities that places people and the \r\nalleviation of poverty at the centre of our developmental \r\ndiscourse. \r\nThe late United States President John F. Kennedy \r\nonce said that if a free society cannot help the many \r\nwho are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich. The \r\nfortress of wealth is not impregnable to the growing \r\nunrest and instability born of crushing poverty. Our \r\nfailure to address and assault global poverty in this era \r\nof excess and innovation stands as the most stinging \r\nrebuke to our existing system of crass commercialism \r\nand unfettered corporate profiteering.\r\nIn an Assembly shaped by the desire to end global \r\nwars, we must remember Gandhi’s admonition that \r\npoverty is the worst form of violence. We cannot simply \r\npay lip service to people’s right to development. Instead, \r\nthat right must emerge as the driving force in this \r\nAssembly’s senior years. The roots of modern poverty \r\nand underdevelopment are deep and diverse. But even \r\nthe most casual student of history will acknowledge the \r\ndebilitating and continuing impacts of native genocide \r\nand the institution of slavery on Caribbean States. \r\nThey constitute in the aggregate an awesome legacy of \r\nunderdevelopment, a historic bundle of wrongs to be \r\nrighted. \r\nI reiterate the united call of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity for reparatory justice from the major \r\nparticipants in and beneficiaries of the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. Our quest for justice is supported by the \r\n33 members of the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States and numerous progressive nations \r\nglobally. The fate of our indigenous peoples and \r\nthe legacies of slavery and colonial exploitation are \r\nneither partisan political talking points nor historical \r\nafterthoughts. They are an ever-present modern reality \r\nwhose redress remains a noise in our blood and an echo \r\nin our bones. These issues must form part of the post-\r\n2015 development conversation, and also a part of our \r\ncombined efforts to uplift the International Decade for \r\nPeople of African Descent.\r\nIt pains me that I must yet again speak, and demand \r\nappropriate redress, on the subject of the retroactive \r\nstripping of citizenship of persons of Haitian descent \r\nborn in the Dominican Republic and their forcible \r\ndeportation to Haiti, a country to which many of these \r\nvictims have only a vague ancestral connection. We in \r\nthe Caribbean Community are pledged to work with our \r\nCaribbean family in the Dominican Republic to assist \r\nin ending this tragedy at the heart of our Caribbean \r\ncivilization, but the authorities of the Dominican \r\nRepublic must demonstrate a good faith not merely \r\nin words but in deeds. We in Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines cannot remain silent or indifferent in the \r\nface of this gross violation of human rights. This not a \r\nmigration issue of the type that is currently engulfing \r\nthe European Union. At its core, this is an international \r\n10/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nhuman rights issue of the gravest kind upon which the \r\nUnited Nations must pronounce unambiguously.\r\nSeventy years ago, the United Nations was founded \r\nwith a central goal of saving succeeding generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war — the very first principle \r\nenunciated in our Charter. Today, wars and rumours \r\nof wars continue to bring untold sorrow to mankind. \r\nToo often these wars are the product of great Power \r\narrogance and decisions based not on fact but on wishful \r\nideological impulses. The results of these actions and \r\ninactions almost invariably exacerbate underlying \r\nconflicts and produce unwanted global repercussions. \r\nInternational terrorism threatens us all and requires \r\nconcerted international cooperation. Anti-terrorist \r\nintervention must not be shaped by which side of \r\na border the terrorist armies happen to encamp or \r\none’s ideological affinity for the Governments most \r\nthreatened by these barbaric hordes. We have already \r\nlearned that modern terrorism, wherever it takes root, \r\ncan threaten peace and prosperity in any corner of the \r\nglobe. Stamping it out must be a shared and pressing \r\npriority.\r\nDiplomacy ought to be most active in averting \r\nconflict and defusing disagreements. Within the \r\nzone of peace that encompasses Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nis concerned at the sharpening of rhetoric between \r\nour long-time friends and allies in Guyana and the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela. Their border dispute, \r\nwhich dates back to the nineteenth century, has long \r\nbeen constrained by the ties of brotherhood, solidarity \r\nand international cooperation. Accordingly, we call for \r\nrenewed and reinvigorated diplomatic engagement in \r\nthe management and ultimate resolution of this vexing \r\nissue.\r\nThe maintenance and restoration of international \r\npeace and security have been the responsibility of the \r\nSecurity Council for the last 70 years. The Security \r\nCouncil, more than any other body delineated in our \r\nCharter, is unmistakably in a period of doddering \r\ndotage, unable to act with the nimbleness or decisiveness \r\nnecessary to meet modern challenges. The necessity of \r\nreform and rebirth, which is acute in any institution \r\nentering its eighth decade, is particularly pressing in \r\nthe case of the Security Council. For too long, reform \r\nefforts have fallen victim to the geopolitical ambitions \r\nof entrenched Council members and the regional \r\nrivalries of legitimate aspirants. This must end. We \r\nmust ensure that.\r\nSimilarly, the important and indispensable work \r\nof United Nations peacekeepers throughout the world \r\nmust be above reproach. The United Nations must \r\nclaim responsibility not only for its successes but \r\nalso for its occasional grave failures. Our collective \r\nsanctimony rings hollow when the United Nations \r\nshirks its undeniable responsibility for spreading \r\ncholera in Haiti, to the tune of 9,400 deaths and more \r\nthan 400,000 hospitalized. Legal loopholes cannot \r\nmask moral responsibility in this case. Nor can \r\nwe condemn sexual violence as a war crime while \r\nshrugging off the unacceptable actions of some United \r\nNations peacekeepers in the Central African Republic. \r\nOur Assembly has a responsibility to be open and \r\ntransparent to meet these sporadic failings head on and \r\nto offer redress to all victims of peacekeeper negligence \r\nor aggression.\r\nOn Wednesday, tomorrow, I will stand a few metres \r\naway from where I am speaking today to witness the \r\nraising of the f lag of the State of Palestine alongside \r\nother States’ f lags in the United Nations compound. \r\nThe decision to f ly the Palestinian f lag here at the \r\nUnited Nations, adopted by an overwhelming majority \r\nof Member States, is an unmistakable endorsement of a \r\ntrue two-State solution with a viable and safe Palestine \r\nliving alongside its neighbours in a secure Israel. But \r\nthe symbolic nature of next week’s ceremony is no \r\nsubstitute for continued action to make that two-State \r\nsolution a reality. With each passing day, realities on \r\nthe ground make such a solution increasingly difficult. \r\nThough the conflict between the States of Israel and \r\nPalestine are undeniably complex, they are not beyond \r\nthe capacity of the parties and the international \r\ncommunity to resolve, and we must do so. And we must \r\nhelp in doing so.\r\nThe Assembly’s unambiguous position on Palestine \r\nis reminiscent of our long-standing and overwhelming \r\nopposition to the United States commercial and \r\neconomic embargo against the people of the Republic \r\nof Cuba. The embargo has persisted for 55 of the 70 \r\nyears that the United Nations has been in existence, and \r\nits toll is measured in billions of dollars, hundreds of \r\nlives and countless developmental opportunities lost.\r\nThis year, Presidents Obama and Castro have \r\ndemonstrated laudable courage in working together to \r\nmove past years of enmity and mutual mistrust. But \r\nthe welcome détente between the two countries has \r\nnot yet led to a lifting of the embargo. There is much \r\nmore to be done to unshackle the Cuban people from \r\n15-29595 11/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nthe chains of an unjust, illegal and plainly outmoded \r\nblockade. Our collective pressure, so critical to the \r\nbelated rapprochement, cannot waver. Instead, we \r\nmust intensify our calls for the complete lifting of this \r\nanachronism, and to make whole this rupture in our \r\nhemispheric family.\r\nThis seventieth year of the United Nations must \r\ntherefore be a year of not only action but also inclusion, \r\noutreach and redress of calcified injustices. As such, \r\nwe must move beyond our inexplicable exclusion of \r\nTaiwan from the work of the specialized agencies of \r\nthe United Nations. The perspective, experience and \r\nexample of Taiwan as an active and responsible global \r\ncitizen are self-evident arguments in support of their \r\ngreater inclusion and participation. Taiwan’s continued \r\nexclusion can be neither explained nor justified by any \r\nrational and forward-looking global gathering.\r\nIn this, our seventieth year, let us pledge ourselves \r\nto liberate our nations and our global family from \r\nthe continuing bondage of poverty, deprivation and \r\nwarfare; to emancipate ourselves from the mental \r\nslavery of discrimination and learned helplessness; to \r\nunshackle our policies from the narrow nationalism \r\nand imperialist ambition that constrains the limitless \r\npossibilities of the human spirit. As nations and peoples \r\nwe have choices. In the 70 years of this Assembly’s life \r\nwe have sometimes chosen unilateralism. Many have \r\nchosen militarism. Many have chosen, too, to defer and \r\ndissemble.\r\nToday, as we look towards a complex and uncertain \r\nfuture, let us instead choose love — love of our fellow \r\nhuman beings, love of our planet, and an abiding \r\nlove not of problems but of their practical solutions. \r\nFor with love, faith, works and hope all things are \r\npossible, including a further 70 years for the better of \r\nthis remarkably important global gathering. We are all \r\nlabouring in this vineyard. We must have the labour of \r\nlove, of love, of love.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Finance, National Security, Grenadines and Legal \r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, National Security, Grenadines and Legal \r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Habib Essid, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Tunisia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic or Tunisia.\r\nMr. Habib Essid, Head of Government of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Habib \r\nEssid, Head of Government of the Republic of Tunisia, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Essid (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): It is my \r\nhonour, as I begin my statement, to convey to Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, and through him to his country, Denmark, \r\nour sincere congratulations on his appointment to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. I should also like to express our thanks to \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa for his able leadership of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\nAt this time, I should also like to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and assure him of the constant \r\nsupport of Tunisia in carrying out his noble duty.\r\nIn the past few years, Tunisia has seen very \r\nimportant events occurring in the framework of its \r\ndemocratic transitional process. There is now greater \r\npolitical and national awareness among politicians and \r\ncomponents of civil society, which has allowed us to \r\nadopt dialogue as the only means to seek solutions to our \r\ncrises and differences of opinion, and to avoid violence, \r\nindividualism and exclusion. Thanks to this consensus-\r\nbased approach, Tunisia has been able to adopt a new \r\nConstitution that manifests the fundamental values of \r\ndemocracy, human rights and the peaceful handover of \r\npower. Similarly, and in the framework of the transition \r\nprocess, we succeeded in organizing legislative and \r\npresidential elections. Observers, both inside and \r\noutside the country, bore witness to the integrity, \r\ntransparency and independence of the elections, which \r\nallowed us to establish robust, permanent democratic \r\ninstitutions. \r\nAs the success of any political process is \r\ncontingent upon efforts made on the economic and \r\nsocial fronts, the Tunisian Government, guided by its \r\nawareness of the need to tackle current challenges — in \r\nparticular countering unemployment, strengthening \r\nnational development investment and ensuring social \r\njustice — decided to draw up a strategic vision for \r\n12/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nthe country for 2016-2020 that will determine the \r\nguidelines and courses set nationally regarding \r\nsustainable development. In this regard, Tunisia \r\nreaffirms its responsibility for improving growth and \r\ndevelopment and acting in line with the aspirations of \r\nits people. We therefore urge our partners and friends \r\nin the international community to support national \r\nefforts in particular in the area of youth employment, \r\nstrengthening investment and support for local and \r\nnational development.\r\nRegional changes have been swift and ongoing. \r\nWe have seen them lead over the past few years to an \r\nexacerbation of the terrorist threat that now jeopardizes \r\nthe stability and security of many States of the \r\nregion, including mine. While our country has made \r\nsignificant progress in the area of security and counter-\r\nterrorism — particularly through the defeat of many \r\nterrorist plans and other criminal activities and the arrest \r\nof many suspects who were then prosecuted — over the \r\ncourse of this past year, we have nonetheless been the \r\nvictims of two heinous terrorist attacks targeting the \r\nBardo Museum and a tourist site in the city of Sousse in \r\na cowardly attempt to undermine our social approach of \r\ncentrism, moderation and tolerance, and to frustrate the \r\neconomy by targeting its vital tourist sector. While we \r\nexpress our great sadness regarding the country’s losses \r\nfrom these two crimes, we affirm that the perpetrators \r\nof these crimes will not enjoy impunity. No one can \r\nresort to terrorism to further his own objectives or to \r\ndestroy Tunisian society. \r\nOur plan for counter-terrorism is based on a \r\ncomprehensive and integrated approach that goes \r\nbeyond the necessity for military and security responses \r\nand seeks to understand the political, social, cultural \r\nand economic reasons behind terrorism. Nationally \r\nspeaking, the prevalence of terrorism and extremism \r\nacross the globe is now a significant incentive for \r\nfinding a new way to combat terrorism, in accordance \r\nwith bilateral and multilateral cooperation frameworks.\r\nWhile we welcome all initiatives to coordinate \r\ninternational efforts to combat terrorism, we reiterate \r\nour offer, made from this rostrum, to convene an \r\ninternational high-level counter-terrorism conference \r\nin Tunisia aimed at coordinating international efforts.\r\nThe alarming increase in conflicts and tensions \r\nthroughout the world, whatever the reason, is of great \r\nconcern to us. It requires the international community \r\nto scale up its efforts to find ways to halt these conflicts \r\npeacefully, particularly by prioritizing dialogue and \r\nmediation efforts and strengthening activities for \r\npeacebuilding.\r\nFor Tunisia, the Palestinian cause remains at the \r\ncore of important issues and conflicts in the region. \r\nWe therefore reiterate our full support to the brotherly \r\nPalestinian people as it seeks to recuperate its legitimate \r\nrights to self-determination and the establishment of \r\nits independent State. Tunisia supports efforts for the \r\ncontinuance of peace negotiations between Palestinians \r\nand Israelis on the basis of a timeline for ending the \r\noccupation, and for the adoption of a United Nations \r\nresolution that would put an end to the Israeli occupation \r\nand restore to the Palestinian people their legitimate \r\nrights. We also condemn the ongoing Israeli blockade \r\nof the Gaza Strip and its settlement policy, which is \r\nin violation of international law and international \r\nlegitimacy. They represent an attempt to impose a new \r\nstatus quo and to undermine the two-State solution \r\nas well as efforts to continue talks on the basis of a \r\nsolution that would guarantee security and stability for \r\nall countries of the region.\r\nNear Tunisia, the brotherly Libyan people are \r\nseeing the fallout from a crisis that threatens its stability \r\nand security and goes beyond the borders of the Libyan \r\nState to jeopardize the stability of the entire region, and \r\nTunisia in particular. We firmly believe that dialogue \r\nremains the sole solution to overcoming Libya’s internal \r\ndifferences and to ensuring national reconciliation and \r\nrespect for the will of the Libyan people for a political \r\nsolution and a rejection of violence. \r\nI reaffirm Tunisia’s appeal to the brotherly country \r\nof Libya and our support for efforts to find a political \r\nsolution under United Nations auspices and establish a \r\nGovernment of national reconciliation and accord. The \r\ninternational community’s support is very important \r\nin that respect. The threats and dangers posed to \r\nneighbouring countries by the spread of the terrorist \r\norganization Daesh from Libya are growing. That \r\nrequires strengthened coordination and cooperation \r\namong neighbouring States. We also need support from \r\nthe international community in our efforts to suppress \r\nthe threats to neighbouring countries.\r\nIn addition to the crises in our region, four and a \r\nhalf years have passed as the Syrian crisis continues \r\nto deteriorate. That is a reflection of the gravity of the \r\npolitical and humanitarian crisis in which our Syrian \r\nbrothers have suffered death, displacement and other \r\ntravails. The situation calls for credible action on the \r\npart of the international community to coordinate and \r\n15-29595 13/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nmobilize efforts to take immediate measures to halt \r\nthe violence, disorder and chaos and to protect life. \r\nTunisia urges all influential stakeholders in the Syrian \r\nconflict to step up their efforts to find a consensus-\r\nbased political solution to the crisis based on dialogue \r\nand peace. We welcome the international efforts to \r\nbreathe new life and hope into the situation and to find \r\na consensus-based political solution that will spare \r\nSyria the threat of fragmentation and division. \r\nIn the face of the suffering of the brotherly country \r\nof Yemen and the humanitarian disaster that threatens \r\nto tear apart Yemeni society, national cohesion and \r\nGovernment, we express our full support for all efforts \r\nto put an end to the bloodshed and war and to assist \r\nthe country to move beyond this crisis and alleviate \r\nthe suffering of the Yemeni people. We call on all \r\nfactions in Yemen to return to the negotiating table \r\nand to prioritize dialogue and reason in the established \r\nframework for the country’s political transition.\r\nNot far from that brotherly Arab country, we are \r\nseeing an exacerbation of the situation in Iraq, where \r\nterrorism is increasingly prevalent and entrenched, and \r\nethnic and sectarian genocide is being perpetrated. This \r\nrequires a firmer resolve than ever on the part of all \r\nregional and international stakeholders to re-establish \r\nsecurity, stability and accountability for the gruesome \r\ncrimes that have undermined the material, human and \r\nhumanitarian assets in that country.\r\nThe sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly \r\nsaw the evolution of many political, development \r\nand security milestones. We saw a galvanization of \r\ninternational efforts to ensure that all means were made \r\navailable for success based on the growing awareness \r\nregarding the need to enhance justice in international \r\nrelations and to put an end to disparities in development, \r\nwhile guaranteeing sustainable development for all in \r\nall social, economic and environmental dimensions. \r\nAmong these milestones we note the holding of the \r\nUnited Nations Summit on the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the \r\nadoption of important resolutions to reduce poverty, \r\npromote social development and actively reduce \r\nthe gaps between the countries of the North and the \r\nSouth by improving the levels of development in all \r\nits dimensions, in particular in developing and least \r\ndeveloped countries.\r\nAlong these lines, the third Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development in Addis Ababa in July saw the adoption \r\nof the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, reflecting the \r\nconcerns of developing and least developed countries \r\nregarding technology transfer, capacity-building, \r\ndevelopment assistance and others, and complementing \r\ninternational efforts in this arena. Tunisia actively \r\ncontributed to the success of these events by actively \r\nparticipating in the preparatory process in our capacity \r\nas a member of the intergovernmental Open Working \r\nGroup on Sustainable Development Goals, and in the \r\ngeographical group relevant to this issue.\r\nIn the framework of similar efforts to support the \r\nwork of the international community in sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we assisted in the preparation of the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of States Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, which is to take place in Paris in December. \r\nWe have finished preparing our nationally determined \r\ncontribution, which reflects the country’s efforts in \r\nthe areas of adaptability and future programmes. We \r\nwelcome the relative successes of the United Nations \r\nin these areas. Nonetheless, we continue to believe that \r\nthere is a need to continue to work together to better \r\nguarantee the efficiency of the Organization’s efforts to \r\naddress important contemporary issues for humankind, \r\nin particular by broadening the decision-making circle \r\nand encouraging balance in international relations by \r\nenshrining the principle of partnership.\r\nThe choice of the topic “The United Nations at 70: \r\nthe road ahead for peace, security and human rights” \r\nas the theme for this session of the General Assembly \r\nis relevant to us all at a time for taking stock of the \r\nprogress that has been made in various areas. Each and \r\nevery one of us here today is responsible for correcting \r\nimbalances and changing the future or destiny of \r\npeoples to ensure more justice, equality and fair \r\nsustainable development. We are all accountable for \r\nredressing these imbalances and ensuring that greater \r\njustice, equality and equitably distributed sustainable \r\ndevelopment prevail in future. That also holds true for \r\nany confrontations and for establishing channels of \r\ncommunication in the framework of mutual respect. We \r\nshall spare no effort to achieve these noble goals.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me also to convey my hope \r\nthat the United Nations will be capable of tackling the \r\nmajor challenges before us today so that, thanks to the \r\nshared desire of Member States, we can achieve peace, \r\ndevelopment and security. I am convinced that the \r\ncommon ground that brings us together is much more \r\nsignificant than the differences that divide us.\r\n14/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nHead of Government of the Republic of Tunisia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Habib Essid, Head of Government of the \r\nRepublic of Tunisia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade, Minister for Education and Training of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade, Minister for Education and \r\nTraining of the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nMr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister \r\nfor Education and Training of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi \r\nPohiva, Prime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Trade and Minister for Education and Training of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Pohiva (Tonga): I congratulate Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft on his assumption of the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session and \r\nassure him of our full support. I should also thank his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his excellent work, \r\nand Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership.\r\nI stand before the Assembly humbled by the words \r\nof His Holiness Pope Francis as he addressed this body \r\nmere days ago (see A/70/PV.3). I am humbled because \r\nin his address His Holiness the Pope spoke directly \r\nto those political issues that occupy us all — those \r\nissues that we might easily resolve if only we had more \r\npolitical commitment and more political will. But His \r\nHoliness the Pope spoke in a language higher than that \r\nof politics — one of morality and of moral imperative. \r\nThese are principles and ideals that have guided me \r\nthroughout my life.\r\nIn this Hall, we are often guilty of an abstraction we \r\ncall “political will”, the political will to address climate \r\nchange, to be careful stewards of our environment, \r\nand to address devastating global inequalities in \r\ndevelopment. This abstraction distracts us. It distracts \r\nus from our need for moral commitment and for moral \r\ncourage. It is this language of morality that speaks to \r\nthe privileged with the imperative “you must leave no \r\none behind”. It is in this spirit of moral commitment \r\nthat I speak to the work my Government has undertaken \r\nto serve the underserved and to meet our aspirations \r\nas they are presently embodied in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nAs the first democratically elected representative \r\nof the people to the rank of Prime Minister in my \r\ncountry, I am particularly pleased with the inclusion of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 16 related to building \r\neffective, accountable and inclusive institutions \r\nat all levels. That Goal relates to the notion of good \r\ngovernance — the guiding principle of my Government \r\nunder our democracy, fit for purpose, and a principle \r\nthat I have always demanded of any Government of the \r\nday in Tonga throughout my almost 30-year career in \r\npolitics.\r\nIndeed, it is my Government’s mantra that good \r\ngovernance, transparency, accountability and law \r\nand order will drive all other development goals of a \r\ncountry. As such, my Government is committing time \r\nand resources to strengthening governing institutions \r\nthrough measures such as the establishment of \r\nan anti-corruption commission, and considering \r\napproaches to removing other challenges and constraints \r\non the sustainable development of the country, such as \r\ncultural perceptions and religious dogmas.\r\nThe objectives of good governance, effective \r\naccountable and inclusive institutions are impossible to \r\nmeet without full support for the human rights of all \r\npeoples living in areas of conflict throughout the world, \r\nincluding in the Pacific islands. Tonga reiterates its call \r\nfor the root causes of such conflicts to be resolved by \r\npeaceful means, and in full recognition of the principle \r\nof the sovereignty of States.\r\nWith the Agenda adopted, the central challenge for \r\nus at this seventieth session of the General Assembly \r\nis to translate these aspirations into concrete actions. \r\nOur final Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nreport 2015 revealed that the achievement in the areas \r\nof health and education has helped to maintain Tonga’s \r\nposition in the Human Development Index. Our people \r\nnow enjoy an acceptable standard of quality health \r\nservice, and children and young people are able to \r\ngo to school and advance to higher education. We are \r\npleased to note that the 14 new priorities for Tonga for \r\nthe next 15 years, as set out in our final MDGs report, \r\n15-29595 15/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nare all included in the 17 Goals of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor 2030: Goal 1, no poverty; Goal 3, good health and \r\nwell-being; Goal 4, quality education; Goal 5, gender \r\nequality; Goal 8, decent work and economic growth; \r\nGoal 9, industry, innovation and infrastructure; Goal \r\n10, reduce inequalities; Goal 15, life on land; and Goal \r\n17, partnership for the Goals.\r\nTherefore, I confirm here again my Government’s \r\nfull support for the Agenda and, with the assistance \r\nof development partners, we will do our utmost to \r\nachieve them by 2030. We in Tonga had followed the \r\nbest practice of the MDGs journey. It was an incredible \r\nlearning experience for my country and we will adopt \r\nthese best practices towards our implementation of the \r\nnew Development Goals and the Agenda as a whole.\r\nTonga, as a Pacific small island developing State \r\n(SIDS), must meet the goals on oceans and seas and \r\nclimate change, to ensure access to affordable and \r\nsustainable energy for all, and the promotion of peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies for sustainable development. \r\nTonga is also aided by the priorities and commitments \r\nset out in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\n(SAMOA) Pathway, which represents an international \r\ncommitment to genuine and durable partnerships. That \r\nwas advanced by this year’s SIDS partnership dialogue, \r\nthe creation of a SIDS Partnership Framework, and \r\nin the report of the Joint Inspection Unit assessment \r\nof United Nations system support for SIDS. The \r\nrelationship between the Samoa Pathway and the 2030 \r\nAgenda is now well established, and we must maintain \r\nthe links between these documents as we review our \r\nprogress.\r\nThe Samoa Pathway is also significant for its \r\ncentral recognition that the challenges that islands such \r\nas Tonga face are different and therefore qualify our \r\ncountry as a special sustainable development case in \r\nneed of targeted and tailored support. This message \r\nwas reaffirmed in the discussion on the means of \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda, it having been \r\nadvanced, as can be clearly seen, in the outcome \r\ndocument of the third International Conference on \r\nFinancing for Development, which makes mention of \r\nSIDS in 25 paragraphs.\r\nA key piece of the development agenda remains \r\noutstanding as we look forward to the successful \r\nconclusion of negotiations on a climate agreement \r\nin Paris at the end of this year. That agreement must \r\nreaffirm the ultimate objective of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change to stabilize \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere. Tonga \r\nremains highly vulnerable to natural disasters, which \r\ncontinue to increase in frequency and destructiveness. \r\nClimate change continues to pose an irreversible threat \r\nto our people, our society, our livelihoods and our \r\nnatural environment.\r\nIn this regard, we welcome the dialogue that has \r\ntaken place in the Security Council and that to be held \r\nat a side event to be hosted by the Foreign Ministers \r\nof France and Germany tomorrow afternoon, touching \r\nupon the security implications of climate change, and \r\nsupport recognition of the links between our climate \r\nand international peace and security. We reaffirm our \r\nsupport for the call on the Secretary-General to appoint \r\na special representative on climate and security to \r\nthoroughly research and report on those links.\r\nTonga’s vulnerability to natural disasters \r\nre-emphasizes the SIDS special case for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, and such vulnerabilities should therefore \r\nbe factored into development finance calculations \r\ndesigned to assist SIDS. Currently, the use of gross \r\ndomestic product per capita as the basis for determining \r\nthe access of SIDS to development finance should be \r\nreplaced by a comprehensive approach that recognizes \r\nour vulnerability to natural disaster. That move will save \r\nTonga from increasing its indebtedness in obtaining \r\nfunds from multilateral institutions for reconstruction \r\nin the wake of a cyclone. Currently, Tonga accesses these \r\nfunds under the condition of a 50 per cent grant and a \r\n50 per cent credit. We therefore support the proposal \r\nfor adopting a new index reflective of our specific and \r\nunique national development characteristics.\r\nWe remain thoroughly committed to the \r\nmanagement and conservation of our ocean and seas. \r\nThis year, Tonga commenced its term on the Council of \r\nthe International Seabed Authority. At home, we have \r\nenacted legislation related to seabed mining activities \r\nwithin our national jurisdiction under the relevant \r\nprovisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS).\r\nWe remain committed to the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of resources in areas beyond the national \r\njurisdiction and fully support ongoing efforts towards an \r\ninstrument regarding the same. We therefore welcomed \r\nthe first meeting of the Pacific Ocean Alliance in May, \r\nunder the auspices of the Office of the Pacific Ocean \r\nCommissioner of the Pacific Islands Forum in Fiji, to \r\ndiscuss the positions of Governments, the private sector \r\nand civil society on the new UNCLOS implementing \r\n16/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nagreement on marine biodiversity in areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction. Within our exclusive economic \r\nzone, we continue to combat the problem of illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing. In welcoming the \r\nadoption of Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the \r\noceans and seas, we support the proposed triennial \r\nUnited Nations ocean and seas conference to drive \r\nprogress on the goal.\r\nAs we work to translate our new Agenda into action, \r\nwe recognize that the development system of the United \r\nNations must adapt to suit our new priorities. We are \r\nsupportive of efforts to ensure that the United Nations \r\nis fit for purpose to implement the 2030 Agenda. We \r\nlook forward to continued dialogue on longer-term \r\npositioning of the United Nations development system. \r\nIn the same vein, Tonga is supportive of continued \r\nefforts to reform the Security Council through an \r\nintergovernmental process in the pursuit of a more \r\nrepresentative and inclusive body, reflective of and in \r\nline with today’s realities.\r\nFinally, most of us have come a long way looking \r\nwith hope for solutions. Our political priorities must \r\nnot distract us from the call so well embodied in the \r\n2030 Agenda to leave no one behind. I re-emphasize \r\nthat this call speaks to us as leaders to work together \r\nagainst injustice and cruel violations of human rights \r\nand dignity, as in the case of West Papuan Melanesia in \r\nthe Pacific; this is within our power. It is a choice that \r\nthose with power and privilege can make. The United \r\nNations has a duty to closely follow up this West Papua \r\ncase and take the necessary action to stop these brutal \r\nand inhuman activities.\r\nWe leaders must rise to a higher moral order beyond \r\ninterests and be guided by what is fair and justiciable \r\nto all. I am concerned that the message delivered by \r\nHis Holiness Pope Francis and other world leaders we \r\nhave heard in the past few days may not have been well \r\nand truly heard. We have an obligation, a duty, and I \r\necho the challenge. We must meet this moral obligation \r\ninternationally, regionally and nationally, or else we \r\nwill be left behind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister for \r\nEducation and Training of the Kingdom of Tonga for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Samuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister \r\nfor Education and Training of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia.\r\nMs. Bishop (Australia): We meet this day at an \r\nimportant time for the United Nations, 70 years after \r\nits foundation. Australia’s representative to the San \r\nFrancisco Conference in 1945 described the General \r\nAssembly as the place where the conscience of the \r\npeoples of the world should have its most potent \r\nexpression. It is appropriate then, here in the General \r\nAssembly Hall, to reflect on what the United Nations \r\nhas achieved and what it needs to achieve for the future.\r\nThe United Nations provides critical services each \r\nand every day in many parts of the world. Often this \r\nimportant work goes unnoticed or unappreciated by \r\nthose not in direct receipt of that support. Australia \r\nrecognizes the dedicated, often courageous work of the \r\nthousands of United Nations personnel in the field who \r\nprotect vulnerable citizens, deliver vital humanitarian \r\nassistance, rebuild damaged societies and support \r\ndevelopment. The United Nations carries out its work \r\nin an increasingly hostile environment.\r\nToday the world faces an unprecedented number \r\nof long-running and seemingly intractable conflicts, \r\ngenerating displacement on a massive scale and \r\nmaking humanitarian need more dire than at any \r\ntime since the Second World War. Terrorism today \r\nis a global threat. The magnitude of the development \r\nchallenge is immense. However, we must acknowledge \r\nthe remarkable achievement that is the United Nations \r\nCharter. The values and aspirations articulated seven \r\ndecades ago still guide us today.\r\nAustralia is proud that, as an active participant \r\nat the San Francisco Conference, we crafted a central \r\nelement of the Charter, Article 56, known as the \r\nAustralia Pledge. Under that Article, United Nations \r\nMembers pledge to take action individually and jointly \r\nto promote higher standards of living; solutions to \r\ninternational economic, social, health and related \r\nproblems; and universal respect for, and observance \r\nof, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Australia \r\ntook that pledge on signing the Charter in 1945. Today \r\nI reiterate that pledge.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), adopted unanimously last Friday \r\nby the General Assembly, is a manifestation of the \r\n15-29595 17/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nAustralia Pledge and a testament to the fundamental \r\nrole of the Organization. Only the United Nations could \r\nhave produced this remarkable result. The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals are necessarily ambitious. Let us \r\nconsider just the first five: to end extreme poverty \r\neverywhere; to end hunger; to ensure quality education; \r\nto ensure healthy lives; and to achieve gender equality. \r\nShould we realize all 17 Goals, we will transform our \r\nworld for the betterment of humankind.\r\nWe must ensure that the remarkable spirit of \r\ncooperation displayed during the negotiation process is \r\nmaintained as we work to turn these ambitious goals \r\ninto reality. The 2030 Agenda recognizes that economic \r\ngrowth, including through private-sector investment \r\nand trade, is central to sustainable development. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda also recognizes that while official \r\ndevelopment assistance remains important, it is only \r\none source of financing for development. The 2030 \r\nAgenda affirms that it is the quality of assistance that \r\nmatters, and that true partnerships for development are \r\nessential, based on respect and cooperation. That is \r\nwhat Australia seeks to achieve with our friends and \r\nneighbours in the Pacific.\r\nClimate change is a challenge for all nations \r\nand decisive action is required. We will succeed in \r\nreducing global emissions only if there is engagement \r\nby the entire United Nations membership. Australia has \r\nannounced a strong, responsible and achievable post-\r\n2020 contribution to international climate action. We \r\nare committed to ensuring the United Nations Climate \r\nConference in Paris at the end of the year is the platform \r\nneeded to secure a collective approach to the below 2° \r\ngoal.\r\nThere is an inescapable truth. We cannot transform \r\nour world unless the place of women within it is \r\ntransformed. The 2030 Agenda requires us to achieve \r\nnothing less than full gender equality. This is not \r\njust the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. \r\nIt is essential to achieve sustainable, inclusive and \r\nequitable economic growth. Australia has established a \r\n$50 million gender equality fund to accelerate support \r\nfor gender equality in our development programme \r\ndelivered in our region, the Indian Ocean/Asia-Pacific.\r\nWe must step up the fight against the global scourge \r\nof violence against women and girls.\r\nLast week the Australian Government announced \r\na new domestic policy, a $100 million women’s \r\nsafety package, improving front-line support services \r\nand providing educational resources to help change \r\ncommunity attitudes to violence and abuse. Similarly, \r\nour overseas aid programme helps countries in our \r\nregion in efforts to eliminate violence against women \r\nand girls. The United Nations women, peace and \r\nsecurity agenda has changed our collective thinking on \r\nthe role of women in conflict. We now need to put it \r\ninto practice. That is why Australia has worked with the \r\nUnited States to produce the first military commanders’ \r\nguide for implementing women, peace and security in \r\nthe field.\r\nA key element of the 2030 Agenda is that peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies are essential to achieving \r\nsustainable development. Human rights, good \r\ngovernance and open and inclusive institutions are \r\ncrucial foundations for development. Human rights \r\nhave been at the very centre of the United Nations over \r\nthe past 70 years, from the United Nations Charter in \r\n1945 to the Sustainable Development Goals in 2015.\r\nWith the rise of terrorist groups like Daesh, the \r\ncontinuing depredations of the North Korean regime, and \r\nthe persistence of forced labour and other contemporary \r\nforms of slavery, the need for the United Nations to \r\nprosecute a strong human rights agenda has never been \r\nmore pressing or urgent. Australia is standing for a seat \r\non the United Nations Human Rights Council for the \r\n2018-2020 term. This is the first time that my country \r\nhas sought election to that body. I believe that Australia \r\nwould bring to the Human Rights Council the same \r\nprincipled and practical approach that distinguished \r\nour 2013-2014 Security Council term. Should we be \r\nelected, our focus would be on empowering women \r\nand girls, strengthening governance and democratic \r\ninstitutions, promoting freedom of expression and \r\nadvancing human rights for all.\r\nAustralia would be at the forefront of efforts to \r\nhold to account those responsible for human rights \r\nabuses and to build more effective preventative and \r\naccountability measures. We would be unrelenting in \r\nour efforts to secure abolition of the death penalty. \r\nOur term on the Human Rights Council would reflect \r\nAustralia’s inclusive, diverse society and build on the \r\nAustralian Government’s strong domestic human rights \r\nagenda.\r\nThere are nations for which the aspirations of the \r\n2030 Agenda, indeed the promises of the United Nations \r\nCharter, appear remote or unachievable. The scourge \r\nof war continues to tear apart families, communities, \r\ncountries and entire regions. As a non-permanent \r\n18/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nmember of the Security Council, we experienced first-\r\nhand the difficulties the Council faces in responding to \r\nthe crises and conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya, Yemen, \r\nSouth Sudan, the Central African Republic and Mali. \r\nNowhere is the devastation greater than in Iraq and \r\nSyria. Daesh is wreaking unspeakable havoc and harm \r\non individuals, families and communities and destroying \r\nthe world’s cultural heritage in gross violation of \r\ninternational law and against the fundamental concepts \r\nof morality. It cannot be allowed to prevail.\r\nAustralia is participating in coalition military \r\naction to combat Daesh in Iraq and Syria. We are \r\ndoing so within the framework of the Charter and in \r\na manner consistent with international law. Defeating \r\nDaesh requires both military and political action. \r\nReconciliation and inclusive governance in Iraq are \r\nthe key to reducing Daesh’s appeal and support. We \r\ncontinue to advocate a political solution that can bring \r\nan end to the conflict in Syria and we support United \r\nNations Envoy Staffan de Mistura’s efforts towards that \r\nend.\r\nWe do not believe any transition option should \r\nbe rejected. All permutations of a political solution \r\nshould be assessed with clear-eyed realism. Australia is \r\ncommitted to defeating terrorism in all its forms. We are \r\nresponding to the challenges of violent extremism and \r\nforeign terrorist fighters, taking on those who would \r\nexploit our openness and modern communications to \r\ncommit violence and promote terror. The humanitarian \r\nconsequences of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq are \r\ndevastating. I commend neighbouring countries \r\nJordan, Lebanon, Turkey, which continue to bear the \r\nbrunt of the population of displaced persons. Australia \r\nhas provided $230 million in humanitarian assistance \r\nsince the start of the conflict.\r\nThe massive f lows of displaced people across the \r\nMiddle East and into Europe have stretched response \r\ncapacities to a breaking point. In this environment, \r\npeople smugglers will strive to prosper from their \r\ndangerous and criminal trade. Australia’s firm response \r\nto people smuggling, and continued cooperation with \r\nits regional partners, have saved the lives of thousands \r\nwho would otherwise have succumbed to the false \r\npromises of people smugglers. It has also enabled us to \r\ngive refuge to those most in need. Consistent with our \r\nrecord over decades of resettling permanently thousands \r\nof refugees, Australia was pleased to announce recently \r\nthat we would resettle permanently an additional \r\n12,000 refugees from Syria and Iraq — registered by \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees — particularly those who are unlikely \r\nto have a home to which they might return. We also \r\nannounced $44 million in funding to support 240,000 \r\ndisplaced persons on the borders.\r\nThe global humanitarian system is struggling \r\nto cope with the escalating demands. The World \r\nHumanitarian Summit in May next year must deliver \r\na nimble humanitarian system which responds to \r\ndifferent types of humanitarian crises in the most \r\neffective fashion. The only long-term solution to these \r\nman-made crises is a political one — to bring these \r\nconflicts to an end.\r\nAustralia’s recent experience as a Security Council \r\nmember confirmed that the Council’s role is more \r\nessential than ever. The Security Council can perform \r\nits role only if it has the tools it needs. The role of \r\npeacekeeping is fundamental. Yesterday, I joined \r\nothers in pledging renewed operational support for the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping system. Australian airlift \r\nwas vital to the United Nations early response to the \r\nSouth Sudan crisis. We have now pledged to provide \r\nour C-17 Globemasters and C-130 Hercules aircraft to \r\nhelp United Nations peacekeepers respond to crises \r\nwhere and whenever we can in the future.\r\nWe recognize that the United Nations needs more \r\ntools for peacebuilding to help vulnerable States \r\nemerge from crises and prevent them from falling \r\nback into violence and disorder. Australia is looking \r\nforward to co-chairing with Angola the consultations \r\non the peacebuilding architecture review later this year. \r\nWe need to strengthen this crucial element of conflict \r\nprevention.\r\nAnother central lesson from Australia’s term on the \r\nCouncil was that accountability is crucial in preventing \r\ncycles of violence. The International Criminal Court \r\nhas a critical role to play and requires our support. \r\nAustralia remains determined to hold to account those \r\nresponsible for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight \r\nMH-17 in July 2014. We owe nothing less to the families \r\nof those aboard that fateful f light. We will not let a \r\nRussian veto impede the efforts of countries grieving \r\nthe loss of their citizens and demanding justice for the \r\nperpetrators of this atrocity.\r\nAll States must uphold their responsibility to \r\nprotect civilians from the most serious international \r\ncrimes. Security Council members have a particular \r\nresponsibility to do so. In that context, we welcome \r\n15-29595 19/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nproposals to restrain use of the veto where mass \r\natrocity crimes are being committed. Australia’s term \r\non the Security Council in 2013-2014 demonstrated that \r\nelected members can play an active and constructive \r\nrole. I am therefore pleased to announce that Australia \r\nis nominating itself to serve again on the Council for \r\nthe 2029-2030 term.\r\nWe do not underestimate the challenges facing all of \r\nus. Equally we should not downplay the opportunities. \r\nWe remain confident that working together we can \r\nrealize the enduring promise of the Charter — for \r\nAustralians, for our region, and for the international \r\ncommunity. And now 70 years on, the General \r\nAssembly is indeed the place where the conscience of \r\nthe peoples of the world has its most potent expression.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on \r\nMr. Philip Hammond, Secretary of State for Foreign \r\nand Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMr. Hammond (United Kingdom): Nearly 70 years \r\nago, the first meetings of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council took place in London. They marked \r\nthe point when the world came together to turn its back \r\non war and to seek to institutionalize the conditions for \r\npeace. By that process, from the ashes of the Second \r\nWorld War, our predecessors embarked upon a shared \r\nquest for peace, development and human dignity.\r\nAnd they succeeded where the League of Nations \r\nhad failed. From 51 Members at its inception to 193 \r\nnow, the United Nations has become a powerful and \r\nuniversally recognized expression of our collective will \r\nto find solutions to the most difficult challenges we face. \r\nIt is the cornerstone of the rules-based international \r\nsystem and an affirmation of the value we attach to \r\nhuman dignity and hope.\r\nBritain is proud to have played its role in the birth \r\nof the Organization. And proud too, 70 years later, of \r\nthe active role we play in international affairs as the \r\nonly Security Council member, indeed the only major \r\neconomy in the world, that both meets the NATO 2 per \r\ncent target for defence spending and the United Nations \r\n0.7 per cent target for development spending.\r\nBut seven decades on, the daily reality for millions \r\nof people is a very far cry from the ideals set out in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Despite the historic \r\nwork delivered under the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, more than a billion people still live on less than \r\n$1.25 a day. Insecurity, extremism and conflict in the \r\nMiddle East have driven millions of people to abandon \r\ntheir homes, creating a humanitarian emergency on an \r\nunprecedented scale. And many millions more still live \r\nunder regimes in which they have no say about how \r\nthey are governed, and in which human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms are denied.\r\nAt the same time, the rules-based international \r\nsystem that keeps the peace between nations is being \r\nundermined by States willing to violate the territorial \r\nintegrity of others or to breach the most fundamental \r\nprohibitions on weapons of mass destruction. And \r\nalongside these challenges, we face the longer term \r\nthreats of climate change, global pandemics and \r\nanti-microbial resistance — threats that we must tackle \r\neffectively now, if we are not to put the lives of future \r\ngenerations at risk.\r\nBut it is in Syria and Iraq, in the crucible of human \r\ncivilization, that our collective values and our will to \r\nact are being most immediately challenged. The twin \r\nevils of Al-Assad’s murderous regime and the brutality \r\nof the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) or \r\nDaesh, have inflicted suffering on the Syrian people on \r\nan almost unimaginable scale. The humanitarian crisis, \r\nthe tide of refugees seeking sanctuary in neighbouring \r\ncountries and in Europe, underscore the urgent need to \r\nend the conflict and represent huge tests of our resolve.\r\nI want to pay tribute to the extraordinary generosity \r\nof Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, which have given a \r\ntemporary home to many millions of refugees and \r\nwhich have accepted this role stoically for years. It \r\nis incumbent upon all of us to support them as they \r\nbear that burden, and to ensure that the United Nations \r\nappeals for Syria are fully funded. And I am proud \r\nthat the United Kingdom is making the second-largest \r\ncontribution of any country to the humanitarian mission \r\nin the region.\r\nWe judge it important that we seek to support those \r\nwho have been displaced as close as possible to their \r\nhomes. Because there will be a new Syria to build, \r\npost-Al-Assad, and that country will need to draw on \r\nthe talent of all the Syrian people. But a humanitarian \r\nresponse alone is not adequate. We share a responsibility \r\nto act to end the bloody civil war and create an inclusive \r\npolitical process, and to work together to crush ISIL \r\nand banish its twisted ideology from the face of the \r\nEarth. The United Kingdom will continue to be a \r\nleading member of the international coalition against \r\nISIL, including in carrying out more air strikes in Iraq \r\nthan any other country except the United States, for as \r\n20/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\nlong as it takes to prevail in what will ultimately be \r\na generational struggle against the Islamist extremist \r\nideology that drives it.\r\nBut the defeat of ISIL on its own will not bring \r\npeace to Syria. An inclusive political settlement is the \r\nonly sustainable way to end the suffering of the Syrian \r\npeople. We must redouble our efforts to build a political \r\nprocess under Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura, and \r\nto hold to account those who have committed crimes \r\nduring the conflict. Positive movement on this agenda \r\nis a crucial test for the United Nations. Progress at \r\nthe Security Council has been blocked for too long. \r\nAll parties must now put narrow interests aside and \r\ncooperate for the good of the Syrian people and to \r\nreassert the values of this Organization.\r\nUrgent though the crisis in Syria is — and to that we \r\ncould add the crises in Yemen, Somalia and Libya — we \r\ncannot neglect the need to act now to prevent future \r\nthreats to global security from arising. But that collective \r\naction will truly work only if we have a shared analysis \r\nof the real causes of poverty, injustice, and the conflict \r\nthat feeds upon it. We need a common recognition that \r\nstrong, transparent and effective institutions, open \r\neconomies and open societies, the rule of law, and \r\nfreedom from corruption are the conditions that will \r\nallow development to f lourish over the long term and so \r\nreduce the drivers that fuel conflict. They provide what \r\nPrime Minister David Cameron has called “the golden \r\nthread of development” and they are vital to the success \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals. Each country \r\nmust, of course, follow its own path to prosperity. But \r\nas we help the poorest countries overcome conflict, \r\npoverty and instability and to move up the development \r\ncurve, it is in all our interests that that development be \r\nsustainable over the long term.\r\nAnd the foundation for all sustainable development \r\nis security. As a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil, the United Kingdom places security as the \r\nprerequisite to good governance, strong institutions \r\nand economic development at the core of its approach. \r\nSo, as the Prime Minister pledged yesterday, the United \r\nKingdom will resume a significant role in enabling \r\npeacekeeping operations, particularly in Africa, \r\nwhere the United Kingdom will support efforts by the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union to end some of \r\nthe world’s most destabilizing conflicts, conflicts that \r\nare prompting mass migration from South Sudan and \r\nsustaining terrorist groups in Somalia.\r\nBut there is another important truth to \r\nunderstand — security within countries can deliver the \r\nbenefits of economic growth only if it is matched by \r\nsecurity among countries. Britain has always believed \r\nthat the stability we seek in relations between nations \r\nis best realized through the framework of laws, norms \r\nand institutions that together constitute the rules-\r\nbased international system that was developed after \r\nthe Second World War, with the Charter of the United \r\nNations at its heart.\r\nFundamental to that system is the fact that States \r\nshould respect one another’s territorial integrity \r\nand political independence. When States challenge \r\nthose rules, all of us have a duty to come swiftly and \r\nunambiguously to the defence of the victims. That is \r\nwhy we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainian \r\npeople. Illegal actions and State aggression must \r\nhave consequences, or the international order will be \r\nfatally undermined. We, the United Nations, insist \r\nthat differences and disputes be resolved within the \r\nframework of international law, not outside it.\r\nThe collective will to tackle threats to our security \r\nmust be extended to the threat we face from climate \r\nchange. It represents not just a threat to the environment \r\nand to our prosperity, but to our security too. The impact \r\nof rising sea levels and rising global temperatures will \r\nbe felt by all of us, but it will hit hardest many of the \r\npoorest countries and those who are least able to adapt. \r\nSo the United Kingdom will not only cut its emissions \r\nat home but, as our Prime Minister announced on \r\nMonday, also increase its support to climate finance \r\nfor vulnerable countries to $9 billion over the next \r\nfive years. We must work for a strong and effective \r\ndeal at the Conference of Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris \r\nin December, built upon clear commitments from all \r\nnations to lower emissions targets still further, and a \r\ncollective commitment to maintain the goal of limiting \r\nglobal warming to two degrees.\r\nSeventy years after the first session of the General \r\nAssembly, the United Nations stands battered by the \r\nwaves of international crises but unbowed, proudly \r\nat the heart of the international order. Over seven \r\ndecades, it has played a critical role in addressing \r\nalmost every challenge we have faced. And crucial to \r\nits future success will be further evolution, embracing \r\nchange, and maintaining relevance in this twenty-first \r\ncentury. The United Nations must strive to represent \r\nthe new realities of our age with a reformed Security \r\n15-29595 21/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\nCouncil. It must have the best possible leadership, \r\nwith a transparent system for selecting the next \r\nSecretary-General. And he — or dare I suggest perhaps \r\nshe? — will have to head a more efficient Organization \r\nensuring that every cent it receives from its Member \r\nStates is used to maximum effect.\r\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations, and \r\nas a permanent member of the Security Council, the \r\nUnited Kingdom will champion that reform agenda, \r\nand we will continue to promote the ideals that the \r\nUnited Nations represents. Seventy years ago, a \r\ngeneration resolved to shape their world on a vision for \r\npeace, security and universal values. Today, realizing \r\nthat vision in its totality still eludes us, but we have \r\ndemonstrated that when we work together collectively \r\nwe can take great strides towards it. Now we must resolve \r\nto demonstrate that collective will; to recognize that it \r\nis not only our moral duty, but also in the enlightened \r\nnational interests of all of us to act; to respond to the \r\ngrave humanitarian crises we face; to tackle the causes \r\nof conflict, poverty and instability; and to uphold the \r\nrules-based international system.\r\nThe world is a better place because of the \r\nfoundation of the United Nations by our predecessors \r\n70 years ago. By holding firm to our ideals as United \r\nNations Members in the face of all challenges and all \r\ntemptations, we will preserve their legacy and continue \r\nto build the foundations for a better age, an age of \r\npeace, hope and dignity for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Hamadi Ould Meimou, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Mauritania.\r\nMr. Meimou (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): It is an \r\nhonour for me to deliver the statement of the President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, His Excellency \r\nMr. Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, and to speak on his \r\nbehalf.\r\n“It gives me pleasure, on behalf of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Mauritania, to extend to Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft our warm congratulations and best \r\nwishes on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. I am fully \r\nconfident that his statesmanship, skills and long-\r\nstanding experience is our best guarantee of \r\nsuccess at this session.\r\n“I should also like to express profound thanks \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his great and \r\ntireless efforts in the service of international peace \r\nand security and for his promotion of dialogue as \r\nan optimum means for addressing current global \r\nissues.\r\n“Today, we meet 70 years after the establishment \r\nof our great Organization, and those seven decades \r\nhave been spent in unabated pursuit of the noble \r\ngoals for which it was founded. We should \r\ncongratulate ourselves on the achievements of \r\nthis eventful history, without overlooking the \r\ntremendous challenges facing the world in the areas \r\nof peace, security and sustainable development. It \r\nis our hope that the post-2015 development agenda \r\nwill effectively address all those challenges. \r\nMoreover, we should all work within the framework \r\nof the United Nations system to alleviate the \r\nburden of foreign debt under which many countries \r\nsuffer, which impedes their economic growth and \r\njeopardizes their stability and social peace.\r\n“We in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania work \r\ntirelessly for the welfare for our people through a \r\nrange of development projects undertaken by the \r\nState, in cooperation with the private sector and our \r\ndevelopment partners. Over the past few years, our \r\ncountry has obtained remarkable results that have \r\nhad a positive impact on Mauritanians’ standard of \r\nliving. Unemployment has been curtailed, and we \r\nhave widened the base for accessing and improving \r\nbasic services so as to achieve concrete economic \r\ngrowth. In the area of promoting the rule of law, \r\nthe Government of Mauritania has worked to \r\nstrengthen the judiciary system and promote its \r\nindependence so as to ensure that transparency \r\nprevails throughout public affairs.\r\n“In recognition of the organic nexus between \r\nsecurity and development, my country has made \r\nsecurity and development top national priorities \r\nand is working to build a modern republican army \r\nequipped with every means to ensure the country’s \r\nterritorial integrity. We have implemented a \r\nmultitude of projects in the most impoverished \r\nregions and provided welfare for vulnerable \r\ngroups. This policy has had a positive impact on \r\nthe security of our homeland and its citizens and \r\nbolstered the pillars of social peace.\r\n“Our security development approach does not \r\nstop there; we have also worked to promote the culture \r\nof dialogue and peaceful debate with all those who \r\ngo astray by misinterpreting and misunderstanding \r\nthe purposes of our Islamic religion and have fallen \r\n22/23 15-29595\r\nA/70/PV.18 29/09/2015\r\ninto extremism and fundamentalism. They have \r\ntherefore been engaged by our clergy, under the \r\nsupervision of the Government — an approach \r\nthat has yielded concrete results. In order to raise \r\nawareness of the benefits of that dialogue, we \r\nhosted an international seminar under the theme \r\n“Culture of peace and moderation” in order to \r\ntackle extremism. The Mauritanian experiment is \r\na good example to follow.\r\n“Our region, the African Sahel, has been \r\nexposed over the past few years to a proliferation of \r\nnetworks of organized crime. Drugs, weapons and \r\nhuman beings are trafficked and smuggled through \r\nwaves of illicit migration and hostage-taking; \r\nextremist organizations have also adopted terrorism \r\nas a profession and thereby endanger security \r\nthroughout the region.\r\n“In order to address and face these challenges, \r\nMauritania has worked with its brotherly States of \r\nChad, the Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso to establish \r\nthe group of five Sahel States with a view to \r\ndesigning a development and security framework as \r\na platform for coordinating the resources of member \r\ncountries in order to promote security and stability \r\nand to work to achieve sustainable development, as \r\nenvisioned in the post-2015 agenda. In this regard, \r\nwe appreciate the appointment of a Special Envoy \r\nof the Secretary-General for the Sahel, entrusted \r\nwith dealing with regional issues. That augurs \r\nwell for good cooperation among the group of five \r\nSahel States and the international community in \r\ncountering terrorism amd organized crime and \r\ndrafting rules for sound and effective sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\n“Recognizing the importance of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Mauritania has taken the initiative to \r\ncoordinate with the United Nations by participating \r\nin its peacekeeping operations. We contributed a \r\nunit of national guards that is deployed in the city \r\nof Bouaké in the sister State of Côte d’Ivoire. We \r\nare also preparing to dispatch an infantry battalion \r\nof 450 troops and a national gendarmes unit of \r\n140 officers in order to contribute to establishing \r\npeace in the Central African Republic. That is our \r\nresponse to the call of duty towards our brotherly \r\nAfrican countries in support of peace and security \r\nin our continent.\r\n“The Islamic Republic of Mauritania is following \r\nwith grave concern the serious developments \r\nin sisterly Yemen. In this regard, we support \r\nOperation Restoring Hope and the tremendous \r\nefforts undertaken by the Arab coalition led \r\nby the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to restore the \r\nlegitimate system of Government to sisterly \r\nYemen, represented by brother President Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour and his Government, \r\nand to implement all relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. We hope that the efforts of the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen to \r\nsolidify peace and security in this sisterly country \r\nwill be crowned with success.\r\n“On the other hand, the ongoing war and \r\nmassive destruction, killing and displacement of \r\nmillions in Syria require us all to support every \r\neffort to bring the Syrian parties together at the \r\nnegotiating table in order to find a political solution \r\nto that war, which has been raging far too long. \r\nThis solution, we hope, will save Syria from further \r\ndestruction and maintain its territorial integrity.\r\n“In the same vein, we call on our brothers in \r\nLibya to agree to a political solution culminating \r\nin the formation of a national Government that \r\nwould organize fair and transparent elections to put \r\nan end to the internecine hostilities that have torn \r\nLibya asunder and made it a sanctuary for extremist \r\norganizations. We trust that the patriotic spirit of \r\nthe Libyan people and its leaders will move them \r\nin that direction so that a State can be established \r\nunder the rule of law and the Libyan people can \r\nenjoy peace and security.\r\n“The Arab-Israeli conflict remains a source of \r\nanimosity and a threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity in a region that is very sensitive and vital \r\nto the entire world. Despite the multitude of United \r\nNations resolutions and negotiations that have \r\ndragged on for decades, the two parties have failed \r\nto reach a formula for a final resolution that would \r\nguarantee the rights of the Palestinian people in \r\nan independent State, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. We condemn settlement activity and \r\nunilateral actions that impede the peace process. \r\nWe also condemn the unjust siege imposed on the \r\nGaza strip, with all its dire consequences for the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people.\r\n15-29595 23/23\r\n29/09/2015 A/70/PV.18\r\n“Our continent of Africa faces a multitude of \r\nchallenges in the economic and security spheres. \r\nThe many development programmes that have been \r\nimplemented with our development partners have \r\nnot achieved the envisaged goals, though some \r\nmeasure of success has been registered. Problems \r\nrelating to poverty, disease and malnutrition persist \r\nand deplete many resources of African countries.\r\n“The outbreak and spread of the Ebola \r\nvirus disease in some West African countries \r\nhighlighted the severe shortcomings in the area \r\nof fighting epidemics and disease. Despite the \r\nfortitude demonstrated by those countries and the \r\ngenerous assistance of African countries and the \r\ninternational community, which stopped the spread \r\nof the disease, there is a pressing need to establish \r\na well-developed and integrated health-care system \r\nthat would protect citizens from diseases and \r\nlethal epidemics. There are also many f lashpoints \r\nof conflict that impede the development of the \r\ncontinent and strain its resources. Despite all these \r\nchallenges, many African countries succeeded in \r\nachieving many of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and are now resolved to implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\n“Africa, with its enormous economic resources \r\nand its demographic weight, deserves to enjoy a \r\npermanent seat on the Security Council. From this \r\nrostrum, we demand that this reform be undertaken \r\nas expeditiously as possible.\r\n“Perhaps the most viable path to achieving \r\npeace and security is to promote the culture of \r\npeace and the values of tolerance among nations, \r\npeoples and civilizations and to uphold justice \r\nfor all. Leaving issues unresolved for a long time \r\nwithout any prospect of a solution, as well as the \r\nwidening gap between the poor and the rich and \r\nthe imbalance in global economic structures, have \r\ncontributed to increased tension and the spread of \r\nthe phenomenon of extremism and terrorism.\r\n“We in the Islamic Republic of Mauritania \r\nreject all forms of terrorism, while firmly abiding \r\nby tolerant Islamic values that renounce violence, \r\nextremism and excess. Islamic values call for \r\ntolerance and brotherhood, and it is our belief that \r\nit is the duty of the international community to find \r\nan effective means to halt the tide of terrorism at its \r\nroots and dry up its sources.\r\n“The pledges undertaken by the international \r\ncommunity at the birth of the Organization will not \r\nbe fully met unless and until a minimum level of \r\njustice in the production and distribution of wealth \r\nis achieved. Furthermore, we will not come full \r\ncircle in delivering on the noble aspirations for \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded without \r\ncreating conditions in which human beings can live \r\nin dignity, freedom and equality. By those means, \r\nwe could achieve the noble goals for which the \r\nUnited Nations was established.”\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.45 p.m.\r\n"
