What has \r\nbeen achieved? Where have we failed? What is there \r\nyet to do to create a safer and better world?\r\nIn July, we marked the seventy-fifth anniversary \r\nsince the Sumner Welles Declaration on the non-recognition \r\npolicy of the illegal Soviet annexation of the Baltic \r\nStates. This policy reflected the principle, based on \r\ninternational law, that the change of borders by force \r\nis not acceptable. The firm stance of the international \r\ncommunity in support of this principle has been of \r\ngreat importance to us.\r\nSince its completion in San Francisco in 1945, \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations has embodied the \r\ncore principles of the international system. However, \r\nfar too often international order and principles have \r\nbeen violated and the United Nations has been unable \r\nto prevent conflicts or build peace or stop atrocities. \r\nPast failures must be lessons for the future. The United \r\nNations, and in particular the Security Council, must \r\nbe able to implement the mission set by the Charter \r\nwith a renewed sense of responsibility.\r\nIt is time to move forward with Security Council \r\nreform. We applaud efforts to revive negotiations on \r\nthis important issue. Latvia supports the expansion of \r\nthe Security Council in both categories of membership. \r\nAt least one additional non-permanent seat should be \r\nensured for the Eastern European States. Early action \r\nof the United Nations in situations of concern is crucial. \r\nLatvia supports the proposal to voluntarily restrain the \r\nuse of the veto in the Security Council in situations \r\ninvolving mass atrocity crimes. It also supports, for all \r\nmembers of the Council, adherence to a code of conduct \r\nthat would suspend their right to veto any action \r\ndesigned to end and prevent mass atrocity crimes.\r\nOn several crucial occasions in recent times, \r\nthe Security Council was not able to take timely and \r\ndecisive action. That has had dire consequences. The \r\nSecurity Council was blocked from playing a role in \r\nstopping Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and in \r\nseeking justice for the victims of the Flight MH-17 in \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.20\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n20th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 30 September 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nan international tribunal that could establish the truth \r\non who shot down that civilian aeroplane. The conflict \r\nin eastern Ukraine has cost thousands of lives and led \r\nto the suffering of millions of innocent victims. Russia \r\nmust stop all forms of support to separatists and use its \r\ninfluence to make them adhere to the Minsk agreements. \r\nFull implementation of the Minsk agreements by all \r\nparties is essential.\r\nThe international community, including the General \r\nAssembly, supports Ukraine and its territorial integrity. \r\nThe illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by \r\nRussia will not be recognized. We are particularly \r\nconcerned about the worsening social, economic and \r\nhuman rights situation in Crimea, especially affecting \r\nCrimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians. Together \r\nwith the rest of the international community, Latvia \r\nwill continue to support Ukraine’s reform process in \r\norder to strengthen its democracy, economy and good \r\ngovernance.\r\nThe horrific conflict in Syria has entered its \r\nfifth year. It has created a humanitarian catastrophe \r\nand destabilized the whole region. The international \r\ncommunity must not abandon the people of Syria and \r\nmust push for a political settlement. Those responsible \r\nfor using internationally prohibited chemical weapons \r\nin Syria must be identified and held accountable. The \r\nconflict and fragility of Syria and Iraq have contributed \r\nto the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/\r\nDaesh and the violent extremism spreading globally. \r\nConcerted international action is vital to defeat this evil \r\nand is key to achieving lasting peace and stability in \r\nSyria, Iraq and the wider region.\r\nLatvia welcomes the recent nuclear agreement with \r\nIran. The full and smooth implementation of the Joint \r\nComprehensive Action Plan is now necessary. Only \r\nthen can a change in the regional dynamics towards \r\nmore engagement and cooperation, as well as greater \r\nstability in the Middle East region, become a reality.\r\nIt is commendable that, despite all the existing \r\nchallenges, the Government of Afghanistan has shown \r\nits commitment to the democratic process. Sustainable \r\npeace and stability in the country can be achieved only \r\nwith continued strong commitment from the Afghan \r\nside and further international support.\r\nThe resolution of protracted conflicts in Transnistria, \r\nAbkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno Karabakh should \r\nremain on the international agenda.\r\nIncreased migration from conflict-torn Middle \r\nEast and African countries to Europe has become \r\none of the greatest humanitarian challenges of \r\nour time. Migration challenges also persist in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region and in the Americas. Beyond \r\nimmediate humanitarian responses, the new trends of \r\nmigration and forced displacement require long-term, \r\ncomprehensive solutions. The stabilization of political, \r\neconomic and social situations in the European Union’s \r\nneighbourhoods must be the ultimate goal. At the same \r\ntime, a greater focus should be put on addressing the \r\nroot causes of increased illegal migration, including by \r\nstrengthening conflict prevention capabilities.\r\nLatvia welcomes the ongoing United Nations \r\nreview of peacekeeping. Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations is essential to \r\neffectively fulfil peacekeeping mandates. Operational \r\ntasks need to be effectively synchronized between all \r\ninvolved parties. The European Union is an important \r\npartner of the United Nations, as demonstrated in \r\nthe Central African Republic, Mali and other places. \r\nLatvia provides a voluntary contribution to United \r\nNations peacekeeping and intends, for the first time, to \r\nparticipate in a United Nations peacekeeping mission.\r\nInternational commitment to protect populations \r\nfrom atrocity crimes has been greatly strengthened in \r\nthe past 10 years. Latvia strongly supports the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court as the legal arm of the \r\nresponsibility to protect and hopes for swift activation \r\nof the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute on the \r\ncrime of aggression.\r\nThis year the international community will conclude \r\ntwo of the most important international processes of our \r\ntimes. We have just adopted the ambitious 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) for the \r\nnext 15 years. The Sustainable Development Goals must \r\ndrive us to make real changes to end poverty and build \r\nprosperity and equality for all. With well-thought-out, \r\nfocused and action-oriented policies we can do it. But \r\nmost importantly, the involvement and accountability \r\nof all stakeholders at all levels will be critical to the \r\nsuccess of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThese Goals will be greatly reinforced by the \r\napproval of a new universal agreement to address \r\nclimate change at the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Paris. Failure to undertake \r\nambitious mitigation actions cannot be accepted. Any \r\n15-29568 3/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nfurther postponement will make adaptation extremely \r\ncostly or even unfeasible. Latvia supports the reduction \r\nof greenhouse gas emissions. It is also important to \r\nsend a strong signal to investors and business of the \r\nplans to move towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient \r\nworld.\r\nThe United Nations has played a crucial role in \r\nadvancing economic and social development and \r\nhuman rights for everyone. These ideals and values \r\nhave proven to be timeless and universal. The United \r\nNations will continue to be an important forum in the \r\nquest for solutions to future challenges through global \r\ndiscussion, raising awareness, creating expertise and \r\nbuilding trust. At the forefront of these issues is the \r\nspeed at which technology is evolving. Technological \r\ndevelopment is a source of progress and growth. At \r\nthe same time, the rapid advancement of technology \r\nhas exposed significant vulnerabilities and a variety of \r\nissues of transnational and cross-sectoral nature.\r\nNations are facing an increasing challenge in \r\ncountering cyberthreats. Efforts to prevent the misuse \r\nof new technologies, either by State or non-State \r\nactors, should be cooperative, international and cross-\r\nsectoral and involve all stakeholders. This will not \r\nbe an easy process. We need to safeguard the right \r\nbalance between fostering freedom of expression and \r\nopen innovation on the Internet and ensuring that \r\nlegitimate national security concerns are taken into \r\naccount. This year, the General Assembly will review \r\nthe results of the implementation of the World Summit \r\non the Information Society over the past 10 years. It is \r\nimportant that this review process, in which Latvia is \r\nplaying a leading role, be successful and contribute to \r\nthe achievement of the overall United Nations goals set \r\nforth in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nNext year, we shall have to choose the next \r\nSecretary-General. It is important that the selection \r\nprocess be transparent and inclusive. Furthermore, it is \r\nhigh time for the Eastern European Group of States to \r\nprovide the best possible candidate for the post of the \r\nnext Secretary-General. It is the only regional group \r\nthat has never been represented in this position.\r\nThe people of our nations want to live in a safe, \r\nstable and prosperous world where conflicts, hunger \r\nand inequalities do not exist. In order to succeed in the \r\ntask of implementing the new development Agenda, \r\nwe all have the obligation to work to make the world \r\na better place. Our responsibility is to ensure that the \r\nroad ahead is built on the goals that were laid down in \r\nthe Charter 70 years ago and which remain valid today \r\nand in the future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by the Mr. Tomislav Nikolić, President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia.\r\nMr. Tomislav Nikolić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Tomislav \r\nNikolić, President of the Republic of Serbia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nikolić (spoke in Serbian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Seventy \r\nyears have passed since the establishment of the United \r\nNations. People live differently now; many changes \r\nhave taken place and many reforms have been effected. \r\nIt is time that we reform the United Nations as well. I \r\ncall on the President to speed up this process during his \r\nmandate.\r\nPerhaps no other session in the history of the \r\nGeneral Assembly has come at a more opportune time. \r\nLast year saw many new developments. Negotiations, \r\nwhich were unimaginable before, were started to end \r\nthe embargo on Cuba. An agreement was reached to lift \r\nsanctions on Iran. We recognize those who took part in \r\nmaking these historic decisions and encourage them to \r\nsee these changes through to completion. This is very \r\nmuch in line with the policy my country has pursued for \r\na number of decades. \r\nThe world of today does not resemble the world of \r\nyesterday, and none of us can remain indifferent to this \r\nfact. Ours used to be a bipolar world, divided into blocs. \r\nWe did not thrive because the poles were violently \r\n4/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nopposed to one another and had access to the most \r\ndangerous weapons the world possessed at the time. But \r\nwe are also not doing well in a world with one Power \r\nthat carries out diplomacy by issuing threats, oblivious \r\nto the concerns of all others, including those of the \r\nUnited Nations. Peoples and States attend to their own \r\ninterests and are thereby exposed and open to extremist \r\nreligious fanatics, giving rise to the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Sham and other extremist movements. \r\nThese terrorist groups now threaten millions of people \r\nand have created a negative image of Islam, the religion \r\non whose behalf they profess to act.\r\nThe two key elements of law and ethics were once \r\nkey in international relations and politics. United States \r\nPresident Woodrow Wilson was a staunch advocate, \r\nwhile the great Serbian poet Njegoš expressed it in \r\nverses of The Mountain Wreath in the following way: \r\nAlong his path who maketh Might his right\r\nRise stenches of inhuman cruelty ... \r\n[and]\r\nAs Wolf doth on the Sheep impose his might, \r\nSo tyrant lords it over feebler fellow; \r\nBut foot to place upon the Tyrant’s neck, \r\nTo bring him to the consciousness of Right — \r\nThis of all human duties is most sacred!\r\nToday, however, legal and ethical factors are \r\nessentially being eclipsed in international politics. \r\nNot infrequently, unlawful and exceedingly immoral \r\nactions are being taken, purportedly for ethical \r\nand legal reasons. This happens most often when a \r\nclear legal norm that brooks no exception — such as \r\nthe need for the Security Council to take a decision, \r\nfor instance — stands in the way of a major Power \r\nachieving its geopolitical goals. International law, \r\ntherefore, and the moral tenets underpinning a legal \r\nnorm and its implementation, are deeply in crisis today. \r\nThere is ample evidence of this, including the most \r\nrecent large-scale crisis. Some call it a migrant crisis; \r\nothers refer to it as another wave of people migrating \r\nfor various reasons. \r\nWhat worries us, though, is that those who \r\nthink that efforts should be intensified in the hope \r\nof restoring peace quickly and easily and promoting \r\neconomic progress for all — developing countries, \r\nin particular — are few and far between. We ought \r\nto look each other in the eye and assess the past year \r\nwith an open mind. We ought to announce what has \r\nbeen achieved in our countries. Some of us ought to \r\nask themselves if their actions helped humankind \r\nor threatened the future of our children. Can we still \r\nbegin our speeches with “We, the peoples of the United \r\nNations”? Are we any closer to peace and prosperity \r\nor are we rushing, with blindfolds on, towards another \r\n1939, which saw the start of a major world tragedy that \r\nlasted six years and whose consequences we shall never \r\nbe able to erase? \r\nSome of the mighty and powerful seem to believe \r\nthat the world economic crisis did not do enough to \r\nterrify our children and their parents. They continue to \r\nuse highly sophisticated weapons to drive people from \r\ntheir homes and countries and thrust them, in fear for \r\ntheir lives, into the turmoil of migration, journeying \r\nthousands of kilometres in a world without food, water \r\nor electricity.\r\nThe responsibility for these developments lies not \r\nwith those who struggle to fight poverty and create \r\nconditions in their countries conducive to a dignified \r\nhuman life, or with Serbia, which has opened soup \r\nkitchens in order to give many their only daily meal. \r\nIt lies with those who have much, whether God-given \r\nor gained by exploiting others. It lies with those who \r\nspend more on arms than all the world’s poor countries \r\ntogether spend on food. It lies with all of us, because we \r\ncannot contemplate sustainable development without \r\naccepting our shared responsibility to tackle one of \r\nthe world’s major challenges — eradicating or at least \r\nalleviating poverty.\r\nI often wonder how parents can look their children \r\nin the eye as they tell them that school and learning \r\nare important for their future and a normal life, and \r\ntry to convince them that they will have food on their \r\nplates once they finish school and acquire learning. \r\nWe do not learn when we live in fear, have nothing \r\nto eat or are threatened by disease, when our parents \r\nare unemployed or we face the threat of a terrible war. \r\nThose here representing the rich and powerful should \r\nthink about that as they put their children to bed in \r\na warm room at night and make important decisions \r\nduring the day. Are profits and political or military \r\nsuperiority really worth so much that we no longer feel \r\nthe sufferings of others but rather let baser instincts \r\ntake over? Peace and prosperity cannot be a privilege \r\nfor the people of certain countries alone; every man \r\nand woman on planet Earth has a right to them. That \r\n15-29568 5/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nis why we hold out a helping hand in our quest to \r\nachieve the Goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) through shared actions \r\naimed at creating a better future for humankind, based \r\non principles that can ensure progress and prosperity \r\nfor all.\r\nSustainable development is clearly a concept \r\naccepted by most of the world. It postulates a global \r\neconomy linking every region of the world on a basis \r\nof trust, ethics, equality and support, as well as a \r\ncomprehensive approach to managing development by \r\nanalysing and assessing the efforts of Governments \r\nand businesses. All management, however, requires \r\nthat certain rules be established, and the question \r\ntherefore is: Who will establish the rules and where? \r\nCan individuals, or groups of individuals, foresee all \r\npossible future events and developments, and is it \r\npossible to control those events and developments at \r\nall? Are we simply establishing a new global power \r\ncentre, oblivious to the individual specifics of States \r\nor groups of States, an organization that has only one \r\nsolution to all problems? What can we do about the \r\nfact that some of the Goals do not correspond to some \r\ncountries’ specific situations? We must understand that \r\nwe cannot control everyone’s lives even if we think it \r\nmay be risky to leave things up to their free will.\r\nMajor changes in the way we live demand that \r\nwe allow time to adjust to ensure that basic values \r\ndo not collapse. Today, the world is extraordinarily \r\ninterconnected in miraculous, virtual ways; \r\ninformation is exchanged and people and goods move at \r\nunprecedented speed. But the people themselves have \r\nnever been so alienated. In huge cities, amid millions, \r\npeople die alone. Individuals, States and international \r\norganizations become alienated. There are many \r\nreasons for this. Increasingly, relations among States \r\nare based on the more powerful, aff luent and developed \r\nimposing their will on others.\r\nWe hope that our new era will usher in a new \r\nbeginning, a new way of thinking, whose essence \r\nwill be, as it should, in the best interests of people \r\nand their immediate and larger communities. We all \r\nunderstand that this is not easy to achieve, for modern \r\ncommunications can be used to impose a way of \r\nthinking aimed at implementing ideas that are not in the \r\ninterests of the majority. Modern man’s urge to conform \r\nand daily struggle to meet ever greater demands, along \r\nwith the spectre of unemployment and hardships in \r\nlater life, undermine his resolve to resist increasingly \r\nevident violations of basic human rights.\r\nThe world today is tragically divided between a \r\nfew enormously rich individuals and a majority who \r\nlive outside the boundaries of human dignity. The \r\ntwenty-first century threatens to be an age in which \r\nsome countries accumulate and concentrate enormous \r\nindividual wealth and the rest are consigned to poverty \r\nand uncertainty. Among those wealthy individuals is \r\nalso an entirely new generation of privileged directors \r\nwho, unjustifiably and immorally, are paid far more than \r\ntheir employees. It seems, however, that the numbers \r\nof those willing to protest this phenomenon has been \r\ngrowing to a point where their demands may have to be \r\nacceded to. I urge everyone to work together to help to \r\nachieve an equitable distribution of the world’s assets \r\nand resources.\r\nWe continue to talk noncommittally about another \r\nmajor challenge, that of climate change, as if its \r\nconsequences were not patently evident everywhere, \r\nand as if we did not see that they are exacerbating the \r\nfriction caused by the already high level of inequality in \r\nthe world. In a wake-up call of sorts, the consequences \r\nof our past and current actions now have the greatest \r\neffect on the weakest of us, the countries that are still \r\nundeveloped industrially and struggling to provide \r\ntheir citizens with a better life. \r\nMost developing countries account for just a fraction \r\nof global warming. They must be given the opportunity \r\nto grow their economies under the same conditions that \r\nhave already enabled other countries to prosper, even \r\nthough their greenhouse gas emissions may be higher \r\nthan the rich would like. We must develop technologies \r\nthat can enable developing countries to develop while \r\nbeing as environmentally responsible as possible, rather \r\nthan using concerns about greenhouse gas emissions \r\nand global warming as pretexts to allow their industry \r\nto stagnate. There are moral reasons, too, for ensuring \r\nthat countries develop. Politicians should be tasked with \r\nproviding full support to scientific activities, on the \r\none hand, and harmonizing and coordinating responses \r\nto climate change and extreme weather situations, on \r\nthe other. Adapting and preparing national and social \r\nresponses to potential scenarios, including worst-case \r\nscenarios, should be our most basic and important goal.\r\nSerbia’s Government and scientific institutions, \r\nin full compliance with the relevant international \r\ndocuments, first and foremost among them the United \r\n6/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, will continue to \r\ncontribute to the activities of the United Nations and \r\nother organizations, primarily through European and \r\nregional initiatives on climate monitoring and reducing \r\nthe negative effects of climate change. Serbia welcomes \r\nthe forthcoming twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the UNFCCC to be held in Paris \r\nlater this year. We intend to support and make a full \r\ncontribution to consideration of this important issue. \r\nWe will continue to work together with others as a team \r\nand an active participant, in hopes that scientists will \r\ncome up with clear answers and irrevocable proof as \r\nsoon as possible, while politicians support them and \r\nimplement speedy, effective solutions.\r\nWe can hope for a better future only if we overcome \r\nproblems such as hunger, wars and diseases. Serbia \r\nhas therefore actively participated in peacekeeping \r\noperations all over the world and has made every effort \r\nto train and equip growing numbers of its officers and \r\nsoldiers to take part in such important assignments. \r\nIn that regard, this year Serbia’s chairmanship of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nhas been universally commended, including by those \r\ncurrently in conflict situations. I should also add that \r\nSerbia has been a candidate country of the European \r\nUnion for more than three years now and has continued \r\nto take decisive steps to harmonize its systems and \r\npractices with European Union standards. At the \r\nsame time, Serbia has also continued to maintain its \r\ncooperation and friendship with Russia and China.\r\nA State is made up of its territory, its people, its \r\nlanguages and its cultural heritage. Serbia is the only \r\ncountry in Europe that in addition to seeing part of its \r\nterritory seized, its people expelled and their murders \r\nand the so-called harvesting of their organs going \r\nunpunished, has now had to deal with attacks on its \r\ncultural heritage under the protection of UNESCO. \r\nHere I recall that in March 2004, in the face of only \r\nsporadic opposition from the Kosovo Force (KFOR), \r\nAlbanians in Kosovo and Metohija destroyed numerous \r\nChristian Orthodox churches, other church buildings, \r\nconvents, bell towers and monastery libraries and \r\narchives, usually by setting fires or explosive devices. \r\nThat was only the brutal and effective perpetuation \r\nof the damage and destruction of over 140 Orthodox \r\nsanctuaries perpetrated since the arrival of the United \r\nNations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo and \r\nthe KFOR in June 1999. In that period, the Albanian \r\nterrorists systematically destroyed the spiritual and \r\ncultural heritage of the Serbian people in Kosovo \r\nand Metohija. Their centuries-long existence there is \r\nevinced in the many monasteries and churches whose \r\nfoundations were laid before the ninth century and \r\nrepresent Serbian deeds etched in stone, the testimony \r\nof the Serbian presence in Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nAt the thirty-first session of its General Conference, \r\nUNESCO confirmed that a crime against a cultural \r\nheritage was committed in Kosovo and Metohija. In \r\nthe small territory of Kosovo and Metohija, UNESCO \r\nhas registered 372 highly valuable cultural monuments \r\nof the Serbian people, as clearl defined by UNESCO \r\nstandards. As many as 49 monuments from the Middle \r\nAges have been identified as a part of European and \r\nworld heritage in which humankind can take pride \r\nand honour. Specifically, they served our pride and \r\nhonour. These invaluable and unique works of art and \r\narchitecture have survived five centuries of Ottoman \r\nrule, the Balkan Wars and the First and Second World \r\nWars. \r\nYet, there they were, in 2004, being savagely \r\ndesecrated and destroyed, buried and ploughed over, \r\nas though that undertaking was a part of preparations, \r\ndesigned with meticulous precision, to coincide with the \r\nunilateral declaration of independence of the Republic \r\nof Kosovo, an event that ensued four years after the \r\nbarbaric destruction of the patrimony of Serbia’s \r\nChristian culture and civilization. Not only Serbian, but \r\nalso European culture and the world’s collective memory \r\nare preserved in Kosovo and Metohija, representing an \r\nimportant human civilizational achievement on planet \r\nEarth. It is therefore important that Serbia, as a member \r\nof UNESCO, continues to be the keeper of this cultural \r\ntreasure, which belongs both to Serbia and to the world.\r\nIn an attempt to falsify history — unfortunately with \r\nthe support of a certain number of countries — Albania \r\nhas submitted, on behalf of the Pristina Administration, \r\na request to UNESCO that the Serbian heritage be \r\ndeclared Kosovar — that is, Albanian. Those who \r\nstrategically destroyed monasteries with the aim of \r\nmarginalizing the importance of Kosovo and Metohija \r\nfor the Serbs and of establishing a new ethnic and \r\ncultural identity for Kosovo and Metohija on the ashes \r\nof the history of others, would be rewarded in that way. \r\nHow is it possible that arsonists and destroyers, with \r\ngoals that clearly go beyond all the ethical norms and \r\nestablished rules on which UNESCO was founded, \r\n15-29568 7/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nare now trying to project themselves as guardians and \r\nprotectors?\r\nShould that request be accepted nonetheless, a \r\ndangerous precedent would be set and the door would \r\nbe opened for the legitimization of violence against the \r\nnational, cultural and religious identity of any people \r\nanywhere. By defending the right of Serbia to preserve \r\nand proudly present its identity and cultural heritage, \r\nas it has done for the past 11 centuries, by preventing \r\nthe unscrupulous dispossession of one’s heritage and \r\nits attribution to somebody else, we are defending the \r\nunderlying principles of international law and human \r\njustice, as well as those on which UNESCO was \r\nfounded. I therefore call on all Heads of State not to \r\nallow the Serbian people to have its soul excised, its \r\nessence usurped and its monasteries in Kosovo and \r\nMetohija, its spiritual backbone, declared the cultural \r\nheritage of the Albanian people there. In short, that is \r\nneither the truth nor a historical and scientific fact. It \r\nis not justice.\r\nPeoples do not acquire history and civilization \r\nby snatching centuries of the existence of others or \r\nby bribing, with Judas’ silver, those to whom the \r\nhistory of others means nothing and who would stand \r\nby indifferently if the spiritual and cultural roots of a \r\npeople — in this case of we Serbs — were removed \r\nfrom the areas from which they had been expelled. The \r\nUnited Nations must preserve its credibility and stand \r\nup to the injustice and evil that Serbia would suffer if \r\nthe Organization acquiesced to that undertaking. I am \r\ncertain that those gathered here, as responsible and \r\nhonourable persons of State, will stand up against the \r\ninjustice and wrong that would be inflicted upon Serbia \r\nand could have a domino effect on other nations and \r\nStates.\r\nSerbia is talking to the representatives of the \r\nAdministration in Pristina. It will fulfil all its obligations \r\nunder Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) and all its \r\nobligations under the agreements reached in Brussels, \r\nbut it will never, ever recognize the independence of \r\npart of its territory, the autonomous province of Kosovo \r\nand Metohija, to which its very existence is connected.\r\nThe problem of the mass migration from the Middle \r\nEast is the greatest challenge of our times. We cannot \r\nanalyse the causes and or identify those directly and \r\nindirectly responsible for the migrant crisis here and \r\nnow. It is an issue of paramount importance and should \r\nbe addressed at an international forum that would bring \r\ntogether prominent leaders and eminent scholars and \r\nscientists. That is the best way to assess the situation \r\nobjectively, provide an answer and propose a solution \r\nto that complex problem. The humanitarian disaster \r\nfacing the world is only a consequence of the crisis \r\nthat has shaken Syria for the past four years, all along \r\nwithout an adequate response from the international \r\ncommunity. \r\nWithout access to common funding, the situation \r\nof Serbia is perhaps more difficult than that of the other \r\ncountries of the old continent. Despite its difficult \r\neconomic situation, Serbia is making every effort to \r\nprovide decent conditions and accommodation for \r\nrefugees. However, if the international community, and \r\nthe European Union above all, fails to make concrete \r\nefforts to solve the problem, a humanitarian catastrophe \r\nof an even larger scale would threaten South-East \r\nEurope. The consequences are impossible to foresee, \r\nbut they would surely affect not only Europe, but the \r\nwhole world as well. As regards the number of asylum-\r\nseekers in the Republic of Serbia, 125,138 persons \r\narrived in Serbia between 1 January and 14 September, \r\nand only 524 have submitted asylum requests.\r\nI would like to draw attention to the alarming \r\npractice of some Governments that have erected wire \r\nand razor fences to ghettoize the asylum-seekers f leeing \r\nwar and destitution. Such an attitude runs counter to \r\nthe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees \r\nand the proclaimed solidarity of the States members of \r\nthe European Union with migrants. It also aggravates \r\nthe situation in countries that respect international law \r\nand treat the individuals struck by calamity humanely. \r\nThe Governments of certain States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations behave as if they had never abandoned \r\nthe ideology that prevailed before the end of the Second \r\nWorld War, thereby destroying the fragile stability in \r\nthe Balkans that was achieved through hard work and \r\ndedication, to which Serbia contributed the most.\r\nMy country has had to cope with a deep economic \r\ncrisis since 2008. Refugees, therefore, cannot expect to \r\nsecure much more than their personal safety in Serbia. \r\nWe will provide it to them irrespective of the fact that \r\ncertain countries also intervene against people living \r\nin Serbian territory. Our care for humankind and our \r\nempathy for those in need, as well as our resolve to give \r\nthose people what we may not need as urgently as they \r\ndo at the moment, will not diminish. Our borders are \r\nopen to receive them and to let them through. We need \r\nno law for that because that is the way we are. Serbia is \r\n8/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nnot a member of the European Union, but it consistently \r\nimplements the proclaimed principle of solidarity, a \r\nfundamental value and the supposedly unconditional \r\nmainstay of the Union itself. I do not understand this \r\nselfishness, and sometimes even the hatred towards \r\nthose who have nothing that some individuals have \r\ncome to nurture. If the rapid pace with which the leaders \r\nof some countries are losing their cool and composure \r\nare any clue, the situation can only deteriorate.\r\nWe therefore need a comprehensive plan that \r\nwould have to be implemented within the shortest \r\npossible time. Without such a plan, migrants will be \r\nleft altogether at the mercy of human smugglers. \r\nPassivity and the increasingly inhumane treatment of \r\nmigrants open a market for smugglers. The sequence \r\nof catastrophes that would ensue in such a case, from \r\nthe Mediterranean to the British Isles, would be tragic, \r\nand the tragedy in which over 800 people died would \r\nbe remembered as just one sad link in that sorry chain.\r\nEven though it was not directly involved in the \r\nconflict in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in \r\nthe 1990s, started and stage-managed in a similar way \r\nto the conflict in Syria, Serbia was labelled guilty. A \r\nresolution was even recently submitted to the Security \r\nCouncil to stigmatize the Serbs as an example of a \r\ngenocidal people, although such a characterization of \r\nany people in the world is unjustifiable. The attempt \r\nfailed, as members of the Security Council were aware \r\nof the true intentions and desires of the initiators, \r\nas well as the possible catastrophic consequences. \r\nWhat kind of genocidal criminals are we? Is it the \r\nimage imparted by the footage of migrants in Serbia, \r\nundaunted and unworried about the reaction of our \r\npeople and authorities, unlike elsewhere in the region, \r\nor is it the image of a hospitable people with a kind \r\nheart? Have Serbian citizens changed? They have not. \r\nThe people of Serbia of all ethnicities have, now and in \r\nthe past, been humane and hospitable, as well as good \r\nneighbours.\r\nIn addition to refugees from Syria, Afghanistan, \r\nPakistan and Iraq, Serbia hosts hundreds of thousands \r\nof refugees and displaced persons from the territory of \r\nthe former Yugoslavia. They are preponderantly Serbs, \r\nbut include also Bosniaks, Croats, Roma and others. \r\nSome of these people have gone to third countries, \r\nwhile others continue to live in Serbia. We are still faced \r\nwith the consequences of these migration as they have \r\naltered the demographic, social and other structures of \r\nour country and society. Then and now, my country has \r\nnot had much to offer to these destitute people who left \r\ntheir homes. It has shared the little it had.\r\nSerbia expects the United Nations Member States \r\nto act responsibly and humanely. We should all bear in \r\nmind that this situation will have global consequences. \r\nCivilization is at a crossroads. Europe is going through \r\nserious travails and tribulations. Now is the time \r\nfor it to show if it still is the standard-bearer in the \r\nimplementation of human rights and the respect of \r\ninternational law or if it continues to turn a blind eye to \r\nthe apparent double standards and allows the attainment \r\nof civilization to be valid only for some countries and \r\nsome peoples.\r\nEquality is applicable not only to relations among \r\nindividuals, but also to relations among States. Our \r\nfathers shed blood on many battlefields for the equality \r\nof all peoples. They fought for our freedom to speak our \r\nmind and for our opinion to be strong enough to change \r\nthings. Freedom and equality are the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, of \r\nnumerous international documents and of national \r\nconstitutions. We must not allow them to become dead \r\nletters.\r\nBy taking up these topics and drawing members’ \r\nattention to them, I hope to motivate us to show genuine \r\nempathy and solidarity, to take responsibility for the \r\nfuture and to build, together and indefatigably, true \r\nhumanism in the Organization that gathered us together \r\nhere today. I would like us to meet in this place with \r\ndifferent messages next year and, if not with our \r\nproblems solved, then at least with steps made towards \r\nsolving the problems that burden us today. I would \r\nlike us to be better every coming year. I would like \r\nthe States of the world to feel that the ideas of liberty \r\nand equality and of a humane and just society are not \r\njust empty rhetoric, but instead genuinely resolve to \r\nimplement them throughout our planet.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Tomislav Nikolić, President of the Republic of \r\nSerbia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\n15-29568 9/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nAddress by Mr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and \r\nHead of Government of the Republic of Djibouti\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nand Head of Government of the Republic of Djibouti.\r\nMr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and Head \r\nof Government of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Republic of \r\nDjibouti, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Guelleh: At the outset, allow me to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, \r\nas well as his country, the Kingdom of Denmark, on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly. \r\nWith his wisdom and experience, I am confident \r\nthat he will successfully steer the proceedings of the \r\nAssembly. I assure him of my delegation’s cooperation \r\nand support.\r\nI would also like to extend my heartfelt thanks to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, who has just concluded \r\nhis mission as President of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session. Mr. Kutesa worked tirelessly to promote \r\nthe work of the General Assembly and we are grateful \r\nto him for his dedicated service.\r\nFinally, I would like to thank our Secretary-General, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, \r\ndedication and personal commitment to advancing the \r\nagenda of the Organization.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI take this opportunity to pay a warm tribute to \r\nthe memory of His Excellency Mr. Roble Olhaye, \r\nPermanent Representative of the Republic of Djibouti \r\nto the United Nations and Ambassador of the Republic \r\nof Djibouti to the United States. My country and \r\nI myself have lost a brother and a great patriot. The \r\nUnited Nations family has also lost a colleague and \r\na friend. The late Roble Olhaye was the epitome of a \r\nseasoned and experienced diplomat. His background is \r\nimpressive; his life rich in teachings and his success \r\nimmense. I would like to particularly emphasize \r\nhis constant struggle for economic and commercial \r\ndevelopment for the African continent. He represented \r\nour country and all of Africa with pride. The grief and \r\nsorrow we feel today following his death are alleviated \r\nby the many expressions of respect and compassion we \r\nhave received from around the world. He be profoundly \r\nmissed by all. May God Almighty welcome him into \r\nhis eternal paradise. \r\nIt is a great honour for me to take the f loor before \r\nthe Assembly of peoples to celebrate, with men and \r\nwomen of all countries, races, languages  and cultures, \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United \r\nNations. When the Charter of the United Nations was \r\ndrafted in 1946, it sent a message of hope for tomorrow \r\nfrom one of the darkest chapters in human history. It \r\nsymbolized, in fact, the international community’s \r\naspiration for peace and cooperation. This year, we \r\ncelebrate not only the seventieth birthday of our \r\nbeloved Organization, which is a historic date in itself, \r\nbut also the twentieth anniversary of the Fourth World \r\nConference on Women and the fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Millennium Declaration.\r\nThis is a crucial year that carries many hopes. \r\nDespite the sustained efforts made to achieve a world \r\nof prosperity, equity, freedom, dignity and peace \r\nfor all people, we all know, unfortunately, we still \r\nhave a long way to go. The international community \r\nundeniably remains faced with an unprecedented range \r\nof major challenges: poverty and hunger, persistent \r\nunemployment and violent armed conflict, and climate \r\nchange. As recently as last year, we saw the health-care \r\nsystems of brotherly countries being overwhelmed by \r\nnew terrible threats, such as the Ebola virus, while new \r\nchallenges have emerged constantly threatening peace \r\nand security. We will have the opportunity to return \r\nto this, but allow me now to address the implications \r\nof the macroeconomic fragility in the global economy, \r\nthe many and varied challenges facing our country and \r\nthe importance of establishing a credible and beneficial \r\nmultilateral trading system for all.\r\nThe global economic and financial environment \r\nis more alarming than ever. The 2008 financial \r\nand economic crisis has had multidimensional \r\nconsequences and many developing countries continue \r\nto face difficult macroeconomic situations. Any \r\nresponse designed to resolve this situation should take \r\ninto account the special needs of Africa, and especially \r\nthose of the least developed countries, and ensure that \r\nthe commitments undertaken at international meetings \r\ncan be implemented. \r\n10/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nIn that regard, we continue to observe with concern \r\nthe current difficulties faced by States members of the \r\nWorld Trade Organization in efforts to identify ways \r\nand means to overcome the impasse in the Doha Round \r\nof negotiations and establish a significant post-Bali \r\nprogramme of work. Major issues are at stake because \r\nit is our responsibility to build a credible multilateral \r\ntrading system that enables everyone, in particular \r\ndeveloping countries, to identify their objectives \r\nin the areas of industrialization and the structural \r\ntransformation of their economies.\r\nClimate change is not only the greatest challenge \r\nthat humankind faces, but also the most important \r\none of our day in terms of development. It threatens \r\nto undermine life for future generations. The many \r\nmeetings on climate change and the lack of progress \r\nachieved illustrate the extent to which this issue is a \r\nsource of controversy and division. It is true that our \r\nclaims are legitimate and understandable. However, it \r\nis also true that Africa has more to lose than others. \r\nThat is why we are ready to assume our responsibility \r\nto reduce our emissions and we hope that the principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities will be \r\nscrupulously respected.\r\nEach region has its specificities and environmental \r\nconcerns that are not necessarily the same as those of \r\ncountries in other regions. My country is particularly \r\nexposed to many natural hazards, the most frequent \r\nand destructive being droughts and f loods. The \r\nRepublic of Djibouti, despite its marginal contribution \r\nto greenhouse gas emissions, is contributing to global \r\nefforts to fight against this devastating scourge. To that \r\nend, we recently hosted a conference in partnership \r\nwith the Climate and Energy Institute of the prestigious \r\nYale University, which has developed a very relevant \r\nclimate model illustrating all the scenarios of the \r\nclimate change impact on our region.\r\nIt is in this spirit that we proposed to establish and \r\nhost in Djibouti a regional environmental observatory. \r\nMoreover, my country has for several years carried out \r\na policy of renewable energy use with the stated goal \r\nof excluding fossil fuels by the year 2020. That is why, \r\ntogether with Ethiopia, we have already put in place a \r\nhydropower project and begun to use the tremendous \r\npotential of our country’s geothermal, wind, solar and \r\ntidal energy.\r\nThe environment is a cross-cutting and transnational \r\nelement. Consequently and logically, we need cross-\r\ncutting, transnational and interdisciplinary policies \r\ncommensurate with the challenge. It is therefore time \r\nto adopt just, fair and scientific climate goals. We hope \r\nthat the twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, which will be held soon in Paris, \r\nwill mark a decisive turning point.\r\nViolent extremism is the product of a deadly \r\nideology that openly advocates the destruction and \r\nelimination of others on behalf of a supposed religious \r\nbelief, whereas Islam is a religion which essentially \r\nadvocates openness, tolerance and love of one’s \r\nneighbour. Our region, East Africa, is one of the \r\nprimary targets of terrorist attacks. Al-Shabaab poses a \r\nmajor threat to our region and is at the root of terrorist \r\nattacks and many attempted attacks in most countries \r\nof our region. This painful experience has enabled us \r\nto develop a knowledge of the workings, practices and \r\nstrategies of terrorist groups, which deserves to be \r\nshared. \r\nThe causes that encourage the spread of the \r\nscourge of extremism and, in effect, terrorist groups, \r\nare deep and diverse. Cracks and fractures seen in the \r\ninternational security architecture and conflict zones \r\nin the Middle East and Africa, as well as economic \r\nhardship, extreme poverty and the perception, justified \r\nor not, of marginalization, all generate a feeling of \r\nuncertainty and a strong desire to belong that can make \r\ngroups sensitive to the extremist rhetoric and lead to \r\nviolent attacks. We all know the human costs and the \r\ncountless security, economic and social problems that \r\nthey bring about.\r\nYesterday, President Obama took the initiative to \r\norganize a summit on this topic, which concerns us \r\nall. We thank him for that because the international \r\ncontext shows us the need and relevance of such \r\nconsultations on a daily basis. No country can fight this \r\nscourge alone, because terrorism knows no borders. To \r\nneutralize this threat, we must work together concretely \r\nand decisively. Strategies to combat and prevent \r\nextremist violence must be perfectly calibrated while \r\nalso avoiding overreaction. They must be based on an \r\nanalysis of the root causes and an understanding of the \r\nreasons driving extremism.\r\nGovernments, regional and international organizations, \r\nreligious leaders and leaders of academia and civil \r\nsociety must join forces to strengthen resilience in the \r\nface of terrorism and establish security and stability \r\n15-29568 11/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nin our countries. In that regard, my country will soon \r\ncreate, within the framework of the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development, a centre of excellence \r\nto combat violent extremism. The centre will seek \r\nto strengthen the capacities of governmental and \r\nnon-governmental actors and provide a space for \r\ndialogue and a platform for the exchange of information \r\namong researchers and specialists.\r\nSince 2008, the Member States represented in this \r\nHall have witnessed the tense and so far unresolved \r\nsituation prevailing in the north of my country following \r\nthe unjustified and incomprehensible occupation by \r\nEritrean forces of part of our territory. Members of my \r\nGovernment and I have come here on several occasions \r\nto brief the international community about the situation \r\nand to inform it about the unreasonable behaviour of \r\nEritrea, which continues to ignore the gravity of the \r\nsituation and reject any attempts at discussion. To \r\nresolve this conflict peacefully, my country, from the \r\nbeginning, has sought out the good offices of the African \r\nUnion, the League of Arab States, the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation and the United Nations. We finally \r\nagreed to mediation by His Highness the Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, in the belief that Eritrea would listen to \r\nreason, but that was in vain.\r\nTo date, more than five years after the signing \r\nof the mediation Agreement, we are still awaiting \r\nthe demarcation of the border and the return of our \r\nprisoners of war. Despite the call to reason by the \r\ninternational community and the adoption of resolutions \r\n1862 (2009), 1907 (2009) and 2023 (2011), Eritrea \r\nhas refused to recognize the existence of Djiboutian \r\nprisoners, even though two of them have, fortunately, \r\nmanaged to escape. This attitude of denial, even after \r\nthe return and the testimony of these prisoners, and the \r\nrefusal of any discussion is contrary to international \r\nstandards and conduct. It demonstrates the danger \r\nthat this country represents for the region and the \r\ninternational community as a whole. My country has \r\nalways managed to preserve peace and we believe in \r\nthe virtues of dialogue and mediation. However, the \r\nterritorial integrity of my country is non-negotiable.\r\nWith regard to Yemen, we are deeply concerned \r\nabout the tragic situation currently facing that brotherly \r\ncountry and especially about the deterioration of the \r\nhumanitarian situation, which has been catastrophic \r\nsince the beginning of the conflict. The Republic \r\nof Djibouti reaffirms its solidarity with the Yemeni \r\npeople and has taken all necessary measures to assist \r\nand welcome the displaced people f leeing the fighting. \r\nThe situation prevailing today in Yemen is the \r\nresult of the refusal of the rebellion to accept and \r\nrespect the political transition period, as negotiated \r\nduring the National Dialogue process. By taking up \r\narms, they have wrought havoc in this country and have \r\nforced the legitimate President to leave the country. We \r\ncondemn the actions of the rebellion and especially the \r\nthreats that these elements pose to the unity, integrity, \r\nstability and sovereignty of Yemen. In addition, the \r\nescalating violence in Yemen is a grave threat to the \r\nsecurity and stability of the region and opens up a new \r\nfront of radicalization, including the rise in power of \r\nAl-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula along our eastern \r\nborder, which poses a distinct threat to my country \r\nthroughout the Bab-al-Mandab strait.\r\nIn this connection, we welcome the military \r\nintervention of brotherly countries of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council, led by Saudi Arabia in Yemen, \r\nat the request of President Hadi Mansour. We thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-Moon and, through him, \r\nMr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, his Special Envoy \r\nfor Yemen, for their dedication and the tireless efforts \r\nthey have shown since the beginning this conflict. We \r\nask the United Nations to redouble its efforts and the \r\nactivities of its good offices to enable the resumption \r\nof a peaceful political transition process because the \r\nsettlement of the crisis in Yemen requires dialogue. \r\nLastly, we urge all Yemeni parties to participate in \r\ngood faith in the dialogue being conducted under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations.\r\nDespite the difficulties and daily obstacles of which \r\nwe are all aware, Somalia has made significant progress, \r\nmost notably in federal training and the establishment \r\nof regional administrations and an independent \r\nNational Electoral Commission. However, the Somali \r\nGovernment still faces significant challenges. It is clear \r\nto us that rebuilding Somalia depends on guaranteeing \r\na stable security environment. Of course, over the past \r\ntwo years, great progress has been made on the ground, \r\nbut the extremist threat remains in view of the increase \r\nin attacks in recent months. The attack on 26 July \r\nagainst Jazeera Hotel is proof of that.\r\nSuch attacks have demonstrated that the African \r\nUnion Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) needs the support \r\nof the Somali security forces. I therefore reiterate our \r\nbelief that establishing a properly equipped, trained \r\n12/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nand led Somali army that, above all, benefits from \r\nthe necessary financial support is imperative. Indeed, \r\nthe project to integrate armed elements into a regular \r\nforce capable of responding to threats to the unity and \r\nterritorial integrity of Somalia should, in my view, \r\nbe a priority for the Somali Government and for the \r\ninternational community. I take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the tireless efforts and heavy sacrifices made \r\nby AMISOM troops and Somali forces, despite the \r\ngravity of the security situation.\r\nWe feel the scale of the Palestinian suffering in \r\nour very being. We are all aware that, after more than \r\nhalf a century of tragedy and resistance, the Palestinian \r\npeople continue to suffer from the Israeli occupation \r\nand to live in inhumane conditions before our eyes. Each \r\ntime a glimmer of hope of resuming peace negotiations \r\nappears, the Israeli State puts an end to it by resuming \r\nthe building of new settlements. We, as Governments \r\nand members of the General Assembly, have a moral \r\nduty and political responsibility to say “no” and to give \r\nthese brotherly Palestine people the right to be free from \r\noccupation, the right to live in dignity and peace and \r\nthe right to aspire to the goals that each and everyone \r\nof us has. An independent and viable Palestinian State, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital and full membership \r\nof the United Nations, is an imperative for peace and \r\nstability in that region and will change the course and \r\nimage of history.\r\nIt is undeniable that we are now at a crucial moment \r\nin the history of our Organization and that the world \r\nin which we live is very different from that of 1945. \r\nIt is also undeniable that this evolution requires us to \r\nadapt to new and changing realities. In that regard, the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly and Security \r\nCouncil reform are paramount. We welcome, in this \r\nregard, the adoption by the General Assembly of \r\nresolution 69/321 on the revitalization of its work.\r\nFollowing the landmark achievement of the founding \r\nfathers of creating the United Nations, we must tirelessly \r\npursue our quest to fulfil all the promises contained in \r\ntheir visions.\r\nWith regard to Security Council reform, it is \r\nimperative that at the start of the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Organization, the African continent, which has \r\nthe largest number of countries, have a permanent voice \r\nin the conduct of international affairs. That is why my \r\ncountry reiterates its full commitment to the conclusions \r\nof the Summit of the African Union Committee of \r\nTen Heads of State, held on 9 May in Livingstone, \r\nZambia, in particular the need to continue promoting \r\nthe Africa Common Position on United Nations reform \r\nand on preserving the unity of the Group of African \r\nStates. Over 15 years after its adoption, the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus remains relevant, especially in this context \r\nwhere African issues are more than ever on the Security \r\nCouncil’s agenda.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Republic of \r\nDjibouti for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ismaël Omar Guelleh, President and Head \r\nof Government of the Republic of Djibouti, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Choummaly \r\nSayasone, President of the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sayasone (spoke in Lao; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I would like \r\nto extend my sincere congratulations to His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of \r\nthe seventieth session of the General Assembly. I am \r\nconfident that, with his extensive diplomatic experience, \r\nhe will guide this session with great success. I would \r\nlike to assure him of our full support and cooperation \r\nin the discharge of his noble duties. I would also like to \r\nsincerely commend His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa for his successful completion of his tenure as \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations since its establishment following the \r\nSecond World War. Its main objectives are to promote \r\ninternational peace and security and development \r\ncooperation, aimed at ensuring that all humankind \r\nlives in peace and in an environment conducive to \r\n15-29568 13/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\ndevelopment. Despite the conflicts and challenges that \r\nhave occurred in different parts of the world, in general \r\npeace, security and development cooperation among all \r\nnations remain the prevailing trends of this era. That has \r\nbeen an important achievement of the United Nations \r\nin fulfilling its mandate enshrined in its Charter.\r\nNevertheless, the international environment continues \r\nto face numerous challenges, such as armed conflicts, \r\nterrorism, poverty and hunger, infectious diseases, \r\nclimate change and natural disasters, which have in \r\nturn posed major threats to peace and development. \r\nI am therefore of the view that we must enhance our \r\npolitical will, mutual assistance and cooperation under \r\nthe banner of the United Nations in order to collectively \r\naddress the challenges facing us. To that end, the \r\nUnited Nations must improve its working methods. \r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic hopes that, \r\non the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations this year, the international community \r\nwill collectively make serious efforts to conduct a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Organization so that it \r\ncan respond to emerging challenges in a more effective \r\nmanner.\r\nI take this opportunity to welcome the successful \r\nconclusion a few days ago of the United Nations \r\nSummit on Sustainable Development, at which the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) was adopted with a view to further addressing the \r\nmajor challenges the world faces today, including any \r\nMillennium Development Goals that have yet to be met. \r\nIndeed, the new development Agenda is the outcome \r\nof open and inclusive intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nIf we are to achieve the set Goals and targets within \r\nthe next 15 years, we need to honour our political \r\ncommitment to strengthening global partnership and \r\ncooperation at all possible levels.\r\nConflicts are being waged today in many regions \r\nof the world, which have caused major concern for the \r\ninternational community. It is therefore important to \r\nfind solutions and to restore peace and development \r\nto those regions. In that context, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic has consistently supported the \r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts. I therefore praise all \r\nparties concerned for reaching an agreement on Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme, which is of historic significance. It \r\nis testimony to the value of dialogue as the best way to \r\naddress a conflict, which should be taken as a model for \r\nresolving hot issues globally.\r\nIn addition, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nhas always hoped that the issue of Palestine, which has \r\nbeen stalled for many decades, will be resolved through \r\npeaceful means by the parties concerned with a view to \r\ncreating two independent States, Palestine and Israel, \r\nliving side by side in peace, based on the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, and within recognized borders, as stipulated \r\nin the relevant Security Council resolutions. The Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic therefore urges the \r\ninternational community to redouble its efforts to help \r\nrestore Palestine to normalcy as soon as possible.\r\nIn the era of interdependence, cooperation and \r\nengagement are key factors for peaceful coexistence \r\nand mutual benefit. The Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic welcomes the recent re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States of \r\nAmerica and the Republic of Cuba, which has opened \r\na new chapter in the history of relations between the \r\ntwo countries, which had been at a standstill for many \r\nyears. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic hopes that \r\nthe re-established relations will be further enhanced, \r\nleading to an end of the embargo and thereby bringing \r\ngenuine benefits to the people of the two nations, the \r\nregion and the world as a whole.\r\nClimate change and severe natural disasters, \r\nwhich are occurring more frequently, have had a huge \r\nimpact on the development of countries, especially \r\nthe developing and least developed countries, which \r\nare most vulnerable due to their limited infrastructure \r\nand insufficient technological, financial and human \r\nresources to respond to and address those phenomena. \r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the international \r\ncommunity to help such vulnerable countries through, \r\namong other things, long-term capacity-building to \r\ntackle such challenges. We hope that the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held in Paris later this year, will be able to adopt \r\nvarious measures to address climate change in the \r\ncoming years.\r\nThe South-East Asian region, which is now in \r\nthe process of economic integration through the \r\nvarious cooperation frameworks of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with a view to \r\nbuilding an ASEAN community by the end of this year, \r\nhas continued to enjoy peace, stability and constant \r\neconomic growth. ASEAN has broadened its external \r\nrelations with different countries and regional groups \r\nat various levels, as well as with the United Nations. \r\n14/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nIn 2016, the first year of the ASEAN community, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic will have the honour \r\nto chair ASEAN for the second time. I hope that the \r\ninternational community, especially the ASEAN \r\ndialogue partners, will continue to support ASEAN-\r\nled mechanisms, in which ASEAN plays a central \r\nrole, so that it can become a community based on the \r\nASEAN way and continue to be a regional grouping \r\nthat contributes to the maintenance of peace and \r\nenhancement of cooperation with other regions and the \r\nworld at large.\r\nThis year marks the fortieth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic. \r\nOver the past four decades, we have gone through a \r\nperiod of healing the wounds of war and advancing our \r\nnational development through the implementation of \r\nfive-year national socioeconomic development plans, \r\nespecially the seventh five-year plan for 2011-2015, \r\nwhich will be completed by the end of this year. The \r\nachievements of the past 40 years can be attributed to \r\nmany factors, but the most crucial have been political \r\nstability and social order, which have provided a \r\nconducive environment for economic growth and \r\nsteadily improved the livelihood of the people.\r\nThe Lao Government has maintained its tireless \r\npolitical will to fight poverty, create benchmarks for \r\nraising the country’s status from that of least developed \r\ncountry, and pursue the path of sustainable development \r\nthrough a three-level development programme known \r\nas sam sang, which identifies provinces as strategic \r\nentities, districts as comprehensively strengthened \r\nentities and villages as development entities. The \r\nprogramme will strengthen my country’s cooperation \r\nwith development partners and pave the way for the \r\nindustrialization and modernization of the country. \r\nIndeed, we are moving in the right direction in our \r\nnational development. \r\nIn addition, in the coming months, coinciding \r\nwith the eighth five-year national socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment plan for 2016-2020, the Lao Government \r\nwill adopt a 10-year socioeconomic development \r\nstrategy for 2016-2025 and the Vision 2030 programme. \r\nNevertheless, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nwill undoubtedly continue to face numerous challenges \r\nin undergoing socioeconomic development. Those \r\ninclude, among others, the impact of the regional \r\nand global economic and financial crises and natural \r\ndisasters. I therefore call on our development partners \r\nand the international community to maintain their \r\nsupport for the Lao People’s Democratic Republic so \r\nthat we can achieve our sustainable development foals \r\nin the coming years.\r\nAlthough the Indochina War ended four decades \r\nago, the legacy of that war continues to pose serious \r\nobstacles to our national development, especially to \r\nagriculture, employment, infrastructure development \r\nand investment programmes in areas that remain \r\ncontaminated by unexploded ordinance. Removing \r\nthose remnants of war will take a long time and require \r\nconsiderable resources. Aware of that serious impact, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has actively \r\npromoted the Convention on Cluster Munitions \r\n(CCM), which can prevent the further victimization of \r\nhumankind. \r\nEarlier this month, the First Review Conference to \r\nthe Convention on Cluster Munitions was held in Croatia \r\nto take stock of the progress and shortcomings in the \r\nimplementation of that important Convention. The Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic takes this opportunity \r\nto call upon those countries that are not yet party to \r\nthe CCM to accede to that universal Convention. At \r\nthe same time, we encourage friendly countries and \r\ninternational organizations to continue to provide \r\nfunding and technical support in that endeavour.\r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of Laos as \r\na State Member of the United Nations. Throughout the \r\nyears, we have actively participated in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations in various areas. Moreover, cooperation \r\nbetween the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and \r\nthe United Nations has steadily grown. The financial \r\nand technical support that have been provided by \r\nUnited Nations agencies, funds and programmes have \r\nall contributed significantly to the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of our country. We hope that such valuable \r\nsupport and cooperation will continue in the coming \r\nyears.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic attaches \r\ngreat importance to promoting and protecting human \r\nrights and has become State party to seven of the main \r\ninternational human rights instruments. In its desire to \r\ncontribute to the work of the Human Rights Council, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has presented \r\nits candidature for membership to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2016-2018. We look forward \r\nto receiving the support of Members States and the \r\nopportunity to contribute to the work of the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\n15-29568 15/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nThis year is of great historical significance to \r\nthe international community, especially because \r\nof the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). I believe that it will \r\nmark an important milestone in realizing the aspiration \r\nof humankind to live in peace, security, prosperity \r\nand social justice, while protecting the environment \r\nand promoting the sustainable development towards a \r\nbrighter future for current and future generations. To \r\nthat end, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic will \r\ncontribute actively to the realization of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and targets that world leaders \r\nadopted a few days ago.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Choummaly Sayasone, President of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the Republic of \r\nNauru, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Waqa: It is an honour to be here for the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations. I can only \r\nmarvel at the scale of that accomplishment. Not only has \r\nthis institution grown from its original 51 Members to \r\nits current 193, but it has also expanded its work to take \r\non a remarkable number of issues facing the world. Our \r\ndebate here provides an excellent opportunity to reflect \r\non what has made the Organization so successful.\r\nI believe the reason for that success can be summed \r\nup in a single word: legitimacy. Only with legitimacy \r\ncan we expect leaders from around the world to gather \r\nhere every September. Only with legitimacy can we \r\nexpect the agreements we reach here to be implemented \r\nin the real world. However, legitimacy is a fragile thing. \r\nIt takes decades to build, but can be lost in the blink \r\nof an eye. Therefore, preserving and strengthening the \r\nlegitimacy of this institution must be at the centre of \r\nour work if the United Nations is to remain a powerful \r\nforce for progressive change in the world. \r\nTherefore, to strengthen the legitimacy of the \r\nUnited Nations, I propose that the road ahead be \r\nguided by three principles: universality, adaptability \r\nand accountability. We took an important step in that \r\ndirection last week with the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), \r\nwhich demonstrates our ability to learn from past \r\nexperience and create an approach that is better tailored \r\nto the needs and circumstances of all nations. \r\nThe Agenda places the welfare of human beings \r\nat its core and lays out a comprehensive set of Goals \r\nand targets to help empower every individual to realize \r\nhis or her full potential. This moves us away from \r\nlooking at single indicators like gross domestic product \r\nor income per capita to measure human progress and \r\nfocuses our work on building a more robust foundation \r\nfor sustainability and prosperity. Education, public \r\nhealth, gender equality, clean water, oceans, energy \r\nand, more importantly, a strong family unit — those are \r\nsome of the blocks on which our future must be built.\r\nFor my country, the ocean is the source of almost \r\nall development possibilities. Unlike large countries, \r\nwe do not have a diversified portfolio of industries. \r\nPhosphate mining and fishing constitute the large bulk \r\nof economic possibilities for Nauru, along with less than \r\na handful of other sources of income. It is all the more \r\nconcerning, therefore, when vessels come to our waters \r\nand engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\n(IUU) fishing. Regional estimates put earnings lost \r\nto IUU at anywhere from millions to over $1 billion. \r\nFor economies like ours, those numbers are staggering, \r\nand if we are to be true to the 2030 Agenda and the \r\ncommitments made to the small island developing \r\nStates, we must do much more to eliminate IUU fishing \r\nand ensure that the income from fishing goes to the \r\nrightful resource owners.\r\nThat and other issues from the 2030 Agenda will \r\nrequire us to rethink the way we cooperate at the \r\ninternational level. Our international and regional \r\nbodies must be fit for purpose. The universality of \r\nthat endeavour will require them to respect national \r\ndifferences and move away from one-size-fits-all \r\n16/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nstrategies. Thematic silos must be replaced by cross-\r\ncutting networks. Implementing agencies at every level \r\nmust become both more nimble and more robust.\r\nAll partnerships — whether multilateral, bilateral \r\nor public-private — must be based on mutual respect \r\nthat recognizes genuine development partners, such \r\nas the Republic of China on Taiwan, a democracy that \r\ncan contribute meaningfully towards development and \r\nprosperity in the world. Needless to say, Taiwanese \r\ntechnology and know-how can make a lot of difference \r\ntowards helping the needy, and, as such, I call for the \r\ninclusion of Taiwan in the development agencies of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAid must be predictable and sustainable, It should \r\nnot be wielded as a weapon to advance partisan political \r\nends. Predatory relationships that pit one group against \r\nanother have no place in the 2030 Development \r\nAgenda. History has demonstrated that openness and \r\nengagement have proven far more effective strategies \r\nfor positive change than isolation and exclusion. Only \r\nin such an environment can we hold one another \r\naccountable for the full implementation of the Agenda.\r\nThat is the vision that Nauru has embraced for the \r\n2030 Agenda, and back home we are taking steps to \r\nmove forward. Like the United Nations itself, we will \r\nneed to build strong domestic institutions to achieve \r\nour goals. Their legitimacy will similarly rest on \r\ntheir inclusiveness, adaptability and accountability. \r\nTherefore, in implementing the 2030 Agenda, we must \r\ngo beyond capacity-building. We must engage in the \r\ndifficult task of institution-building. International and \r\nregional agencies and development partners should \r\nback those efforts with real resources that include long-\r\nterm, in-country engagement when appropriate, so that \r\nthey leave behind durable domestic institutions run by \r\na skilled national workforce. \r\nNauru is asking for a lot from its development \r\npartners. We want to be better partners ourselves. \r\nAnd at the end of the day, implementation of the 2030 \r\nDevelopment Agenda will happen mostly at national \r\nand local level. On that note, let me thank our partners \r\nAustralia, Taiwan, Russia, Cuba and others for their \r\nsupport towards our sustainable development priorities. \r\nOur efforts to improve the legitimacy of \r\ninternational institutions must extend beyond those \r\nmost directly involved in the 2030 Development \r\nAgenda. The Security Council in particular must better \r\nreflect the geopolitical realities of the world today. \r\nTherefore, the list of permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers should be expanded. We support the inclusion \r\nof Germany, India, Japan, Brazil and others in the \r\npermanent category. In addition, the Security Council \r\nmust continue to adapt and respond to the most pressing \r\nissues of today. That is why Nauru calls on it to make \r\nclimate change a permanent agenda item. It should be \r\nsupplemented by the appointment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of a Special Representative on climate and \r\nsecurity. In addition, relevant organs of the United \r\nNations should assess their capacity to respond to the \r\nsecurity implications of climate change.\r\nThe governance of the Bretton Woods institutions \r\nshould also be made more representative, with \r\ndeveloping countries given a greater presence. The \r\nglobal economy has become more reliant on the f low \r\nof international capital, and with the frequency of \r\nfinancial crises increasing, the legitimacy of those \r\ninstitutions will continue to be tested.\r\nHowever, climate change will be the largest test \r\nof our international and domestic institutions. We \r\nhave already seen how some climate impacts can \r\noverwhelm the capacity of even the most powerful \r\namong us. Clearly, a strong, legally binding agreement \r\nin Paris is absolutely critical, with ambitious mitigation \r\ncontributions from all countries. The agreement should \r\nbe guided by a temperature-increase goal of 1.5°C, \r\nconsistent with our vision of a safe and secure world. \r\nIt must also ensure that climate financing is available \r\nfor adaptation, particularly for the most vulnerable \r\ncountries. And for dealing with the impacts that exceed \r\nour adaptation efforts, it should anchor an international \r\nmechanism on loss and damage. \r\nThe United Nations was created \r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge \r\nof war, which twice in our lifetime has brought \r\nuntold sorrow to mankind”. \r\nAt present, climate change, if left unaddressed, \r\npromises impacts no less catastrophic for many of our \r\nnations.\r\nToday marks the lead-up to a very important \r\nmilestone in my people’s history — the seventieth \r\nanniversary of our return home. During the occupation \r\nof my country in the Second World War, Nauruans \r\nwere forcibly evacuated to what is now Chuuk state in \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia. Due to widespread \r\nfood shortages and the harsh conditions imposed by our \r\n15-29568 17/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\ncaptors, our population fell to below 1,500. We were in \r\ndanger of extinction. Nauruans know very well what \r\nhappens to small, vulnerable countries when the big \r\nones fail to address their problems in a responsible \r\nmanner.\r\nI strongly believe that many of the major economic \r\nPowers want to reach an agreement at the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\n(COP21) in Paris. Many have already come forward with \r\nmeaningful mitigation contributions that will certainly \r\nrequire a great deal of effort to achieve. While we know \r\nit is not enough, I do not doubt their sincerity. However, \r\nI am starting to doubt whether they are willing and able \r\nto make the fundamental changes in their political and \r\neconomic systems required to achieve our ambitious \r\ngoals. The intense lobbying to accept an unsatisfactory \r\noutcome has already begun, and in the international \r\nprocess, that has often meant that we will be presented \r\nwith a take-it-or-leave it deal at COP21. Would such \r\nan agreement have any legitimacy? Can we solve the \r\nclimate problem without it?\r\nThe number 70 has biblical significance in the \r\nChristian faith, as it is composed of the numbers 7 \r\nand 10. The number 7 often represents the concept of \r\ncompleteness, while the number 10 often refers to law \r\nand responsibility. It is fitting that during the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly we will complete our \r\nwork on a new set of global agreements to tackle the \r\nchallenges of our generation. The number 70 can also \r\nrepresent a period of judgement. We stand at a critical \r\nmoment in history as civilization outstrips the natural \r\nboundaries of our planet. Our response during the next \r\nfew years will determine the fate of future generations \r\nfor the next thousand years. Will we continue to march \r\nto an inexorable decline? Or will we join together to \r\nmeet the challenges before us? Thankfully, we still \r\nhave a choice ,and the widespread recognition of the \r\nneed for change I have heard during the past week gives \r\nme hope that we will make the right one.\r\nMay God bless the Republic of Nauru and may God \r\nbless the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Agila Saleh Essa Gwaider, Acting \r\nHead of State of Libya\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Acting Head \r\nof State of Libya.\r\nMr. Agila Saleh Essa Gwaider, Acting Head of State \r\nof Libya, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Agila Saleh \r\nEssa Gwaider, Acting Head of State of Libya, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nActing Head of State Gwaider (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAs the General Assembly gathers this year, we celebrate \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nCertainly, we have accomplished a lot during the past \r\n70 years in the economic field, in the protection of \r\nhuman rights and in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. However, the Organization also \r\nexperienced failures because of the lack of appropriate \r\nstructures to effectively deal with the continuous \r\nincrease in the magnitude and number of challenges as \r\nwell as their nature, compared to those that existed at \r\nthe founding of the United Nations. \r\nIt goes without saying that the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security remains the first \r\npriority for the Organization. It is also the biggest \r\nchallenge we face in an evolving world that is \r\nconfronted by new complications, such as terrorism, \r\nthe proliferation of armed conflicts, natural disasters \r\nand climate change. All these result in humanitarian \r\ncrises that have manifested themselves in different \r\nforms, such as refugees, internally displaced persons \r\nand illegal immigrants.\r\nToday, the United Nations Member States are in \r\nneed more than ever of consultation, cooperation and \r\nmutual assistance to address common challenges and \r\nto ensure a better future for the generations to come. \r\nThe Charter of the United Nations stipulates that the \r\nOrganization was established to save future generations \r\nfrom the scourge of war. However, that goal remains \r\nelusive. Although armed conflicts between nations \r\n18/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nhave been reduced, ideological, ethnic and sectarian \r\nconflicts within States continue to spread dramatically. \r\nThat spread is accompanied by unprecedented \r\nviolations of human rights over and above the spread of \r\nterrorist organizations. The emergence of terrorism is a \r\nkey driver of conflict and instability in many countries, \r\nespecially in the Middle East and Africa.\r\nWe in Libya represent a f ledgling democracy \r\nseeking to find its way in order to take hold as an \r\nadded value in the minds of the people and to transform \r\nthe country into one with transparent, democratic, \r\neffective and stable institutions. However, the spread of \r\nweapons and armed groups, some of which have turned \r\nto criminal and terrorist behaviour, in addition to the \r\ncountry’s exploitation by some people with personal \r\ninterests, have all resulted in the spread of chaos in the \r\ncountry and weakened the central authority. In addition, \r\nthat spread has constituted a real threat to democratic \r\ntransformation and has encouraged the emergence of \r\nterrorist organizations and the recruitment of additional \r\nforeign terrorist fighters.\r\nDuring the past year, Libya has witnessed the \r\nemergence of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nthe Levant, or Daesh, an outcome of and ally to Ansar \r\nal-Sharia, which asserts control over the towns of \r\nDerna and Sirte, with a view to taking the two towns \r\nas starting points to assert full control throughout \r\nLibya and to exploit Libya’s resources to finance \r\nthe establishment of an extremist entity that refuses \r\nto recognize the national State and fights against \r\ndemocracy. That entity harbours the aim of extending \r\nfrom Mauritania to Bangladesh, thereby subjecting the \r\nentire region to the law of the jungle, while claiming to \r\nfollow the law of Islam. However, that ideology has been \r\ntotally rejected and resisted by the Libyan people by \r\nway of every force available under the leadership of the \r\nlegitimate authorities, represented by the elected House \r\nof Representatives and its duly formed Government. \r\nThose groups have been and remain an essential \r\npart of the militia alliance of Libya Dawn, which has \r\nseized the capital, Tripoli, and repeatedly announced \r\nthat it will continue to support Ansar Al-Sharia in \r\nBenghazi, while describing them as revolutionaries. \r\nWe realize that all of those terrorist and extremist \r\ngroups are nothing but tools to implement the policies of \r\nforeign countries that have persisted in providing them \r\nwith arms and ammunition. Furthermore, they have \r\nfacilitated the arrival of foreign fighters in Benghazi, \r\nSirte and Derna, to participate in the fighting against \r\nthe Libyan army, which is locked in a fierce war to rid \r\nLibya of terrorism by whatever modest means it has at \r\nits disposal.\r\nThe efforts of the Libyan authorities in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism and to protect Libya from terrorist \r\nattacks is being hampered by external support for \r\nterrorism activities, in addition to the continuing arms \r\nembargo and the insistence of the Security Council in \r\ncontradicting its decisions by its non-approval of the \r\nLibyan Government’s requests for an exemption from \r\nthe arms embargo, in order to arm the Libyan army. \r\nUnfortunately, some of the permanent members of \r\nthe Council have justified such conduct as if to avoid a \r\nnegative impact on the Libyan political dialogue, which \r\nwe understand has led to a draft political agreement on \r\n11 July that was accepted by the legitimate authority \r\nafter it made significant concessions, and initialled \r\nby most of the parties involved. However, that same \r\nagreement has been rejected by the so-called General \r\nNational Congress (GNC), which represents the militias \r\nthat occupy Tripoli. Those militias are allied with \r\nAl-Qaida and Ansar Al-Sharia, supporting them with \r\narms and fighters in the war against the Libyan army \r\nthat is taking place in the cities of Benghazi and Derna.\r\nThe threat of terrorism on the part of the Islamic \r\nState, Al-Qaida and Ansar Al-Sharia is not limited \r\nonly to Libya. The terrorists view Libya as nothing \r\nmore than a base camp rich with significant resources \r\nripe for exploitation to finance its operations in North \r\nAfrica and the Sahel region, as well as Europe, if they \r\nwere to control it. All United Nations States Members \r\nshould be aware of the gravity of the position taken \r\nby the Security Council. Therefore, with respect \r\nto matters of international peace and security, they \r\nshould exercise pressure towards the lifting of the arms \r\nembargo on the Libyan army, accelerate the approval of \r\nthe application for exemption from the arms embargo \r\nand provide assistance to the Libyan Government in the \r\narea of security, according to the provisions of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2214 (2015).\r\nI can assure the Assembly that nothing divides the \r\nLibyan people and that the vast majority is seeking any \r\npossible means to put an end to the unjustified fighting \r\namong brothers, and restore the security and stability \r\nof the country. Nevertheless, they are hostage to the \r\narmed groups, and thus unable to express their views.\r\n15-29568 19/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nHundreds of thousands of Libyans have become \r\ninternally displaced persons or refugees aspiring to \r\nreturn to their homes as soon as possible. That could \r\nbe fulfilled only through an agreement on a strong \r\nGovernment that enjoys the confidence of all Libyans, \r\ncontrols all of the Libyan territory and is supported by \r\nthe international community. We appreciate the effort \r\nmade by the United Nations Support Mission in Libya \r\nto facilitate dialogue among the Libyan parties and \r\nform a Government of national accord that represents \r\nall Libyans, while placing the national interests above \r\nall other considerations.\r\nThe House of Representatives, as the legitimate \r\nauthority elected by all Libyans, was and remains \r\nsupportive of dialogue as a strategic option to resolve \r\nthe political and security crisis in Libya. The House of \r\nRepresentatives made every possible concessions to \r\nencourage the illegitimate party to disassociate itself \r\nfrom terrorism and join the dialogue table, with the aim \r\nof sparing Libyans from more bloodshed and putting an \r\nend to the destruction of Libyan cities. \r\nHowever, we have noticed increasingly intransigent \r\npositions and misinterpretations of the f lexibility \r\nshown by the House of Representatives. It seems that \r\nsuch f lexibility has been misunderstood, even by \r\nMr. Bernadino León, Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General, who tried to bring us back to square \r\none by unraveling all that had been achieved in the \r\npast 10 months through dialogue and negotiations. In \r\nthat regard, I want to emphasize from this rostrum the \r\nfollowing.\r\nThe House of Representatives is committed to \r\ndialogue as an approach to resolving the security and \r\ninstitutional crisis in Libya, but it will not agree to any \r\nregression regarding that which has been approved by \r\nthe majority so far.\r\nNo agreement may be imposed on a future \r\nGovernment to take any step whatsoever in favour \r\nof any terrorist organization that has been listed by a \r\nSecurity Council sanctions committee.\r\nThe war against terrorism in Benghazi, Derna and \r\nSirte cannot be part of a ceasefire arrangement under \r\nthe agreement, unless it includes surrender on the part \r\nof the terrorists and the turning in of their weapons.\r\nThe House of Representatives hopes to receive a \r\nfinal draft of an agreement that does not reward the \r\nperpetrators of crimes, including the destruction of \r\nState property and forced, armed seizure of the capital. \r\nIn the case of the continued intransigence of the \r\nGeneral National Congress in rejecting the agreement, \r\nthe House of Representatives calls on the boycotting \r\nmembers to advance the national interests and the \r\ninterests of their constituents on any and all matters. \r\nThey are called upon to disassociate themselves \r\nfrom the extremist militias and to join the House of \r\nRepresentatives in order to participate in the selection \r\nof an inclusive Government of national accord \r\nthat excludes the terrorist groups. We call on the \r\ninternational community to exercise influence in that \r\ndirection.\r\nThis year, the Mediterranean Sea has witnessed \r\nan unprecedented wave of illegal migration coming \r\nfrom Africa and Asia and heading towards Europe. \r\nSadly, we have taken note of the loss of thousands of \r\nlives by drowning at sea. In that regard, we express \r\nour condolences and sympathy to the families of the \r\nvictims. \r\nWe reiterate Libya’s position in support of all \r\ninternational efforts seeking to reduce the risks to \r\nillegal migrants in the Mediterranean, based on respect \r\nfor the principles of international law, particularly \r\nrespect for sovereignty and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of States. \r\nWe express Libya’s readiness to contribute, within \r\nthe limits of its capacity, to prevent the smuggling of \r\nmigrants and to rescue lives in the Mediterranean. We \r\nalso emphasize that the humanitarian crisis must be \r\naddressed comprehensively, in consultation with the \r\ncountries of origin, transit and destination, and while \r\ntaking into account the need to address the root causes \r\nof illegal migration in general and reasons for the large \r\nincrease in the numbers of migrants passing through \r\nLibya in recent months.\r\nThe security approach to the problem of migrant \r\nsmuggling is insufficient. Libya believes that using \r\nforce against smuggling boats off the Libyan coast may \r\nincrease the complexity of the Libyan crisis, and will not \r\ncontribute to reducing the migrant phenomenon. That \r\ncan be achieved only by providing the legitimate Libyan \r\nGovernment with the capacity to extend its authority \r\nover all Libyan territory andto control its borders, \r\nincluding the necessary capacity-building assistance \r\nin that area, especially the arming of the Libyan army \r\nwith the necessary equipment and training. \r\n20/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nLibya cautions against any foreign military activity \r\nconducted without its consent and control in Libyan \r\nterritorial waters or within its exclusive economic \r\nzone that could harm fishing activities and lead to the \r\nplundering of its marine living resources.\r\nPeace in the Middle East cannot be achieved in the \r\nmidst of the ongoing Israeli occupation of the Palestinian \r\nterritories, which denies the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople and seeks in all possible ways to Judaize the \r\ncity of Jerusalem. The occupation f lies in the face of all \r\ninternational resolutions on the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, in particular on the right of return \r\nand the right to establish an independent State with full \r\nsovereignty over its territory, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital.\r\nLibya demands that the siege imposed on the \r\nPalestinian people be lifted and that they be provided \r\nwith protection. The Israeli occupation authorities must \r\nbe compelled to stop all acts of violence and intimidation \r\nagainst the Palestinian people and to comply with all \r\ninternational resolutions, especially with regard to the \r\nreturn of refugees to their homes and the cessation of \r\nsettlement activities and of the repeated attacks against \r\nthe holy sanctuary of Al-Haram Al-Sharif in Jerusalem.\r\nWe condemn all atrocities against the Syrian people \r\nand express our support for all international efforts \r\naimed at finding a peaceful settlement that will affirm \r\nthe rights of the Syrian people to live in a dignified \r\nand democratic system that respects human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nWith regard to brotherly Yemen, we hope that the \r\nArab coalition will restore security and stability to \r\nYemen and help reach a peaceful solution to the crisis, \r\nunder the supervision of its legitimate Government and \r\non the basis of Security Council resolution 2216 (2015). \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nActing Head of State of Libya for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Agila Saleh Essa Gwaider, Acting Head of State \r\nof Libya, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Christopher J. Loeak, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Christopher J. Loeak, President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Christopher \r\nJ. Loeak, President of the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Loeak: I bring the General Assembly \r\nthe warm greetings of “Yokwe” from the people and \r\nnation of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nThe United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and its Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) offer small island States \r\na powerful tool with which to shape and adjust our \r\nown domestic strategies. The international community \r\nhas spoken, and a changing world is mapping a \r\nvisionary landscape that reaches into the distant years \r\nthat have too rarely been part of our own national \r\ndiscussions — beyond 2020, beyond 2023, towards \r\n2030 and even farther, to the middle of the century.\r\nIn adopting the SDGs, the Marshall Islands cannot \r\nafford a set-it-and-forget-it mentality, which has too \r\noften marked past international efforts. We now have a \r\npowerful opportunity in which to merge recent national \r\nplanning improvements and construct an architecture \r\nfor measuring progress and pinpointing gaps. Such gaps \r\nare not only our own, but also those of our partners. \r\nToo often, we have — all of us — operated with \r\ngoodwill, but without accountability for our collective \r\nperformance. Our post-2023 national trust fund \r\ndeserves a strong support system and also represents an \r\nopportunity, if we use it, to work towards specific goals \r\nand benchmarks. If we can jointly harness our national \r\nand global priorities, if we can commit our own efforts \r\nand national resources, however small they may be \r\nright now, and if our close partners can work with us to \r\nrestructure assistance-delivery to target the SDGs, then \r\nmy nation too can climb the development ladder.\r\nI welcome the establishment of a comprehensive \r\nassistance programme with the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency that will not only enhance our national \r\n15-29568 21/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\ncapacity to monitor and evaluate serious issues of \r\nnuclear contamination but that will also address health \r\nstrategies and other key SDG benchmarks.\r\nThe Marshall Islands faces some of the more \r\ncomplex development, security and planning challenges \r\nin the world, but we lack the full tools available to \r\ntackle them. A nation struggling to attain basic social \r\ndevelopment goals will not be equipped to resolve any \r\nother challenge.\r\nProgress in education is key. Firm efforts are \r\nunder way to correct our course and to provide better \r\nopportunities for our youngest and future generations. \r\nWe have found new pathways for building on our \r\ntraditional knowledge and culture to enable our \r\neducation system to draw on our own Pacific story \r\nand strength. But our efforts and good intentions \r\nalone cannot ensure that every willing student has an \r\nopportunity to succeed. We need international support.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands has one of \r\nthe world’s highest rates of diabetes, which has led \r\nmy Government to declare a state of emergency. \r\nNon-communicable diseases remain a primary threat \r\nto our national well-being. Without transformative \r\npartnerships, and without extending more closely to our \r\nshores the renewed United Nations 2008-2013 Action \r\nPlan for the Global Strategy for the Prevention and \r\nControl of Noncommunicable Diseases, we risk a tragic \r\ndownward spiral.\r\nThe term developing nation implies forward \r\nmovement, yet for far too long the Marshall Islands \r\nhas been only treading water. We have promising \r\nopportunities and aspirations for improving our \r\ninvestment platforms, but our untapped yet substantial \r\nresource base is often coloured by larger international \r\ninfluence.\r\nOur fisheries represent not only a vital sector for \r\nour own development, but also a wider contribution \r\nto international food security, because the Pacific \r\nis steward of half the world’s commercial tuna. Our \r\nforeign fishing nation partners, who not by accident are \r\nalso the drivers of global influence, have held the purse \r\nto our own future for far too long. Key stocks in the \r\nPacific are being plundered at unsustainable rates that \r\njeopardize our future.\r\nAlready, higher returns from foreign licenses have \r\nbenefited our own national fiscal future, yet that is only \r\na fraction of the true potential. It is unacceptable that, \r\non the one hand, we are expected to achieve the SDGs \r\nand to demonstrate dramatic development progress \r\nwhile, on the other hand, we are blocked from further \r\ngains from our own resources by the self-interestas of \r\ndistant fishing nations.\r\nThe Marshall Islands and the States parties to \r\nthe Nauru Agreement Concerning Cooperation in the \r\nManagement of Fisheries of Common Interest remain \r\nfirmly committed to the benefits of the Vessel Day \r\nScheme and targeted high seas closures as a condition \r\nfor fishing our waters. The tables have turned and, if \r\nothers wish to fish our waters, they must now do so on \r\nour own sovereign terms.\r\nAs a low-lying island nation with no higher ground, \r\nclimate change poses a severe threat to our security. \r\nSome have said that there is no more hope and no \r\nmore time. I forcefully disagree. The future of my \r\nnation — the future of our very land — may rest more \r\nin the hands of my fellow world leaders than in my \r\nown. There is still hope — hope that my nation will \r\nbe able to tackle the most difficult planning challenges \r\nand to build resilience wherever we can, and hope that \r\nthe world will not turn a blind eye. I can assure the \r\nUnited Nations that the Marshall Islands refuses the \r\nvery notion that we would willingly relocate wholesale \r\nto another country, or resign ourselves to saying that if \r\nthe water comes, it comes. \r\nAs we move to the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (UNFCCC) later this year, in Paris, I am proud \r\nthat climate change is now recognized by all world \r\nleaders as a reality that deserves, and is receiving, a \r\nfirm and collective response. Everyone must act. Many, \r\nincluding my own nation, have already committed \r\nto emissions cuts well into the future of 2025, 2030 \r\nand beyond. But the world’s initial efforts are falling \r\nsignificantly short. Instead of indifference or fumbled \r\nexcuses, we must achieve true leadership that provides \r\na direct response to closing the global emissions gap.\r\nAs the broader United Nations debates Security \r\nCouncil reform to adjust it the modern world, the \r\nnations that portray themselves as deserving leaders \r\nhave an excellent opportunity to demonstrate their \r\nleadership by not ducking the bill or pointing fingers, \r\nbut by embracing the challenge of the global emissions \r\ngap. They should begin to speak about opportunities \r\nfor new forms of energy, instead of dancing around \r\nperceived threats to growth. For the island nations, a \r\n22/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nworld without a true commitment to decarbonization \r\nand meaningful strategies for its attainment is \r\nultimately no world at all.\r\nAs dramatically different as our landscape is today, \r\nthe tensions of an earlier age continue to resonate, from \r\nthe time when the Pacific islands region served as the \r\nhorrific theatre for a global power struggle. Decades \r\nlater, we again face the complex push-and-pull of larger \r\ninternational politics. Our regional baseline is often one \r\nof severe fragility. We have sharp exposure to external \r\nshocks, and some of our emerging and future security \r\nchallenges not only extend beyond our capacity but \r\npush the envelope of international precedent. \r\nThe treatment of our security as small-island and \r\nlarge ocean nations cannot be considered apart from \r\nthat of much larger interaction across the Pacific. Some \r\nmay view political alliances, borders and, in some \r\ncases, significant marine mineral resources as mere \r\npossessions ready to be plucked by the highest bidder \r\nor the strongest military force, just as one might pick \r\nripe fruit from a tree. That contradicts the spirit of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nI offer my firm support for the initiative proposed \r\nby New Zealand during its Security Council presidency, \r\nwhen it convened a Council meeting on small island \r\ndeveloping States and threats to international peace \r\nand security (see S/PV.7499). That meeting revealed \r\nissues that slip under the global radar but that cannot \r\nbe ignored. I urge the Council’s establishment of a \r\nregular agenda item on security issues in small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nI am proud to announce the formal establishment, \r\nearlier this week, of diplomatic relations between the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands and Cuba. \r\nEveryone should participate on the international \r\nstage. The Republic of the Marshall Islands supports \r\nTaiwan’s meaningful participation in the specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations, including the World \r\nHealth Organization, the International Civil Aviation \r\nOrganization and the UNFCCC. It is imperative that \r\nthe global community fully recognize and evaluate \r\nTaiwan’s important commitment to reduce its emissions. \r\nFurthermore, I call for Taiwan’s involvement in the \r\nimplementation of the post-2015 development agenda, \r\nand urge recognition of the important assistance it has \r\nprovided to my country in the areas of health, education \r\nand energy. The Marshall Islands welcomes Taiwan’s \r\nefforts as a regional peacemaker, including in cross-\r\nstrait issues, and urges that States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations recognize and encourage such progress. \r\nLike many other countries, the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands believes that awareness of the \r\ncatastrophic impacts and humanitarian consequences \r\nof nuclear weapons must underpin all efforts towards \r\nnuclear disarmament. As a former United Nations \r\nTrust Territory of the Pacific Islands, the Republic of \r\nthe Marshall Islands has a unique legacy shared only \r\nby a few other nations. Even while the United Nations \r\nwas supposed to be furthering our development, 67 \r\nnuclear tests were conducted in our nation between \r\n1946 and 1958 by our former administering Power, the \r\nUnited States of America, under our United Nations \r\ntrusteeship status, including through authorization \r\nunder two United Nations resolutions. That was the \r\nonly time the United Nations ever explicitly authorized \r\nthe use of nuclear weapons, and the results were, and \r\nremain, beyond tragic.\r\nIf our own past and its contemporary impact \r\ncontinue to bear that heavy burden, the whole world \r\nshould know our story. I would therefore strongly urge \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon to include the powerful \r\nand specific example of the Marshall Islands and the \r\nrelated role of the United Nations in his statements \r\naimed at encouraging progress on nuclear disarmament \r\nand test bans.\r\nIt is essential for the survival of humankind \r\nthat nuclear weapons never be used again under any \r\ncircumstances. The universal way to accomplish that \r\nis through the total elimination of such weapons. I am \r\ndeeply disappointed that political distractions resulted \r\nin the lack of an outcome from the Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons earlier this year. It should be our goal \r\nas the United Nations not only to stop the spread of \r\nnuclear weapons but also to pursue peace and security \r\nin a world without them.\r\nThis year, I look forward to a truly united United \r\nNations with the courage not only to address the \r\nimmediate emergencies at hand but also to move us \r\nforward into our dynamic century.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of the Marshall Islands for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\n15-29568 23/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nMr. Christopher J. Loeak, President of the Republic \r\nof the Marshall Islands, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros.\r\nMr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Dhoinine (spoke in French): As I take \r\nthe f loor for the last time before the General Assembly \r\nafter five years in office as President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, I wish to discharge the duty of conveying to \r\nthe General Assembly a message of solidarity from the \r\nComoran people. In the name of the Government of the \r\nComoros, and on my own behalf, I would also like to \r\nexpress our sincerest thanks to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-Moon and to all those who have helped to make our \r\nstay in New York so warm, in particular the authorities \r\nof the United States of America. Lastly, I would like \r\nto congratulate the President on his election to lead \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session, the \r\nimportance of which is manifestly clear.\r\nThis session opens at a crucial moment in the \r\ndevelopment of humankind. Since man first appeared \r\non Earth, we are the first generation in the vast expanse \r\nof time — perhaps 3 million years after the appearance \r\nof our remote ancestors — to be aware of the physical \r\nlaws that govern us and of the unfortunate effects of the \r\nirrational use of natural resources. As in 1918, after the \r\nGreat War, that incomparable horror, and as in 1945, \r\nafter the victory over fascism, that base ideology, but \r\nalso as in the 1990s, when we faced the absurdity of \r\nan arms race in weapons of mass destruction, today as \r\nbefore, nothing prevents us from uniting to effectively \r\ncombat pollution and poverty.\r\nAs world leaders aware of our responsibility in the \r\nface of impending disaster, we must rationally work \r\nhere and now to save humankind, and we are capable of \r\ndoing so. We must take advantage of this unprecedented \r\ninternational setting to harness the efforts of all nations \r\nto make our planet sustainable and equitable before \r\n2030, through a programme of surpassing ambition. \r\nTherefore, at the moment when the Assembly has just \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), I wish to commend the outstanding \r\nand consistent work that was done under the impetus of \r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nMy country, the Union of the Comoros, fully \r\nendorses the agreed Agenda, which consolidates the \r\ngains of the Millennium Development Goals while \r\npaving the way to a new era through 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals to be met over the next 15 years. We \r\nmust therefore commit ourselves to putting a definitive \r\nend to poverty in all its forms, to eradicating hunger \r\nand to promoting sustainable agriculture in order to \r\nguarantee food security, good health and the well-being \r\nof all all. We must also guarantee a quality education \r\nfor all without exception, promote lifelong learning \r\nopportunities for all and ensure gender equality, as well \r\nas the full empowerment of women.\r\nIt is also our duty to ensure the availability, \r\nsustainable management and cleanliness of water \r\nfor all and to guarantee access to clean, affordable \r\nand sustainable energy in order to promote sustained \r\neconomic growth. To that end, several countries \r\nshould immediately begin work on major projects to \r\nbuild resilient infrastructure, to promote sustainable, \r\ninclusive industrialization and to encourage innovation \r\neverywhere that will reduce inequalities within and \r\namong countries. We cannot imagine that humankind \r\nwill thrive on Earth unless urgent action is taken \r\nto combat climate change and its impacts, while \r\nconserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources for sustainable development.\r\nIt is in this way that we will promote the \r\nsustainable use of terrestrial ecosуstems, manage \r\nforests sustainably, combat desertification, combat \r\nand halt land degradation and put an end to the loss \r\nof biodiversity. We will need to find ways and means \r\nto continue to build peace throughout the world in the \r\nframework of sustainable development. And we must \r\nhave access to justice for all, and establish effective \r\nand accountable institutions at all levels. Lastly, we \r\nmust build a world without poverty or inequalities, a \r\nsustainable world through a new road map that will \r\nsave humankind. Therefore let us take on ambitious \r\ngoals, for our very survival depends on it.\r\n24/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nAs I stressed earlier, we face a situation similar to \r\nthat which our very close ancestors experienced with \r\nsadness and suffering, but against which they struggled \r\nuntil victory was achieved. I call it slavery, a system \r\nthat almost exterminated a large part of humankind, \r\nquite simply because one side thought itself superior \r\nto all the others. We face a situation somewhat similar \r\nto that experienced by our countries during the two \r\nworld wars, but for which our peoples gave their lives \r\nwith courage and temerity until the final victory \r\nto save humankind from chaos. We face legitimate \r\nquestions that were asked by our ancestors when, for \r\nhalf a century, they powerlessly bore witness to an \r\narms race that was leading humankind inexorably \r\ntowards its own destruction, but where common sense \r\neventually prevailed. We face a situation akin to that \r\nfaced by almost all African countries, including my \r\nown, which for decades were subjected to the misdeeds \r\nof colonialism, but against which the valiant peoples of \r\nAfrica, Latin America and Asia fought until acquiring \r\ntheir sovereignty and the independence of their \r\nterritories, thereby saving humankind from indignity, \r\ndecadence and shame.\r\nToday, the world is directly following the \r\nconsequences of wars that forced millions of men, \r\nwomen and children to leave their homelands, to board \r\nmakeshift boats and to take refuge and live in inhumane \r\nconditions, and sometimes even to remain indigent. If \r\nwe add to that the barbaric acts perpetrated by terrorist \r\nmovements, which are increasing throughout the world, \r\nespecially in Africa, it is time for that international \r\ncommunity to speak with one voice and with firm \r\nconviction and to decisively say, “never again”.\r\nIn a world of complete deprivation, where each \r\nnation must take part in safeguarding international \r\nsecurity, how can we, in a small country like mine, be \r\nengaged in the fight if, at the same time, we must be on \r\nthe front lines to defend our dignity, which has been \r\ndisregarded by a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil of the Organization, whose primary role is to \r\nensure compliance with the norms of international law?\r\nI must underscore that the Union of the Comoros is \r\nthe only country in the world, which, at the time of its \r\naccession to independence, did not benefit from respect \r\nfor the law. Unlike all former colonies, the archipelago \r\nof the Comoros, composed of the islands of Mayotte, \r\nAnjouan, Moheli and Grande Comore, which was \r\nadmitted to the United Nations as an independant State \r\nand subjected to international law, has been separated \r\nfrom a part of its territory by the former colonial Power, \r\nFrance, in contravention of all norms and principles \r\ngoverning international relations.\r\nThose present here will recall that, against the \r\nwill of the Comorian people, France exercised its veto \r\nand continues to exercise its power over our territory. \r\nGiven what is happening in Eastern Europe today, we \r\nwonder what significance the European Union gives \r\nto compliance with international law by accepting the \r\nComorian island of Mayotte as a European outermost \r\nregion, contrary to the relevant resolutions of the African \r\nUnion, the League of Arab States, the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation and the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nAt previous sessions, I informed the Assembly that \r\nwe had signed a political declaration with President \r\nFrançois Hollande in Paris that enabled us to hope that \r\nbilaterally a solution could be found that would give \r\nComorians back their dignity. Unfortunately, to date \r\nFrance has refused to acknowledge that all Comorians, \r\nfrom whichever island they come, may freely move \r\naround the islands. Separated families, abandoned \r\nminors, displacements of populations in makeshift \r\nboats, precisely as is occurring in the Mediterranean \r\nSea — all of that leads me to urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to demand the application of international \r\nlaw, as France itself is rightly claims each time that \r\ninternational norms governing international life are \r\ncontravened.\r\nOf course, the main objective of the high joint \r\ncouncil established between France and the Comoros \r\nis to facilitate bilateral dialogue and rebuild the trust \r\nthat had disappeared between the two countries. \r\nHowever, we must note that the main mission assigned \r\nto that Council — facilitating movement of goods \r\nand peoples — has still not been accomplished. By \r\ncontinuing to defy international law on the issue of \r\nthe Comorian Island of Mayotte, France has prevented \r\nthe expected results and progress from being achieved \r\nin the dialogue between the two parties. From this \r\nrostrum, therefore, I once again appeal to the French \r\nauthorities for us together to find ways and means to \r\nput an end this human tragedy, which every day causes \r\nComorian families to plunge into mourning. I also \r\naddress the community of nations, which those in this \r\nHall represent, to ask that international law be applied \r\nso that a lasting solution to this dispute can be found.\r\nWith political will, nothing is impossible. I therefore \r\nwelcome the fact that Palestine has finally been able \r\n15-29568 25/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nto hoist its f lag at the United Nations. I also welcome \r\nthe fact that Cuba and United States of America have \r\nproved that, even after half a century of conflict, States \r\ncan find formulas adapted to overcome deadlocks and \r\nforesee a peaceful future for their peoples. Lastly, I \r\nwelcome the historic agreement concluded between \r\nIran and the countries of the P5+1 on the nuclear \r\nissue, which augurs well for a calmer international \r\ncooperation.\r\nIn a few months, after five years in office in a \r\nrotating presidency that fell to the island of Moheli, \r\na Comorian from the island of Grand Comore will \r\nsuccced me, in accordance with our Constitution. In \r\nthat electoral democratic process under way, I would \r\nappeal for support from the international community \r\nand from the friends of the Comoros for the victory of \r\nour young democracy. I also appeal to everyone here \r\nthat, after the scheduled elections, Member States \r\nwill support our country on the path towards stability, \r\ndevelopment and well-being of the Comorian people.\r\nAs my country stands ready, after 40 years of \r\nindependence, to begin the second phase of its history, \r\nI remain confident that in the future the next President \r\nof the Comoros will be able to say from this rostrum of \r\nfree countries,\r\n“We have now achieved the territorial integrity \r\nand unity of my country, the Comoros, within its \r\nborders inherited from colonization.”\r\nI also remain confident that my successor will be able \r\nto say from this rostrum of free countries,\r\n“I thank the United Nations for having actively \r\nacted for the achievement of the main goals \r\ninscribed in our common Charter.” \r\nLastly, I remain confident that a President from the \r\nComoros will be able to say to his compatriots from the \r\nfour islands,\r\n“The time has come for all of us to work together \r\nto build our free, open and prosperous country, one \r\nwhich is confident in its future and in its people’s \r\ndestiny.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Ikililou Dhoinine, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang \r\nMangue, Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear a statement by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\r\nMr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Obiang Nguema Obiang Mangue (Equatorial \r\nGuinea) (spoke in Spanish): It is a pleasure for me to \r\ntake the f loor before the General Assembly on behalf of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, who, \r\ndue to numerous duties of State, is not able to be here \r\ntoday.\r\nEquatorial Guinea is participating at this session \r\nof the General Assembly in a renewed spirit of faith \r\nand trust in the relevant role played by the Organization \r\nin promoting peace, security and stability among our \r\nnations in order to create the basic conditions for the \r\nwell-being of humankind. Motivated by that trust, my \r\ndelegation wishes to warmly congratulate Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft for his unanimous election, which reflects the \r\ntrust that the international community has in the rigour \r\nshown by his country in its treament of international \r\naffairs. I am sure that, during his tenure as President of \r\nthe General Assembly, he will always be able to count \r\non the support and cooperation of the Government \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. We would like \r\nalso to congratulate Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, for the \r\ncommendable work carried out during his term, with \r\nthe important decisions taken that will trace out the \r\npath for the United Nations towards the democratization \r\nand revitalization of its institutions, as well as for the \r\n26/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nuniversal scope of its decisions. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to warmly congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki Moon for his tireless efforts to face up \r\nto the complex challenges facing the Organization. We \r\nextend to him our support and cooperation to achieve \r\nevery success in his endeavours.\r\nDespite the attempts of some to monopolize the \r\nUnited Nations system with their undeclared interests, \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea has never lost its \r\nfaith and confidence in the relevant role that the United \r\nNations must play with regard to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and in the promotion \r\nof fundamental human rights to guarantee the overall \r\nwell-being of humankind. The United Nations is the \r\nonly world body in which all States must have faith \r\nand trust, as is stated in its Charter. All countries are \r\nrepresented according to the principle of sovereign \r\nequality among States, including the democratic \r\nprinciple of respect for the majority opinion and for \r\ncountries’ own decisions.\r\nThe events that have occurred in the first quarter \r\ncentury of this century show a degree of weakness \r\nin the role of the United Nations when it comes to \r\npreventing and eliminating conflicts between States, \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nand in promoting the economic well-being of States. We \r\nare concerned at the proliferation of armed conflicts \r\nin Africa, Europe and the Middle East, as well as \r\ninstability caused in countries of the developing world; \r\nthe progressive advance of of terrorism in various parts \r\nof the world; and drug trafficking and uncontrolled \r\nimmigration caused by those conflicts. All that would \r\nsuggest that the United Nations has much more to do. \r\nIts Members must act in solidarity and according to the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, which should \r\nunite them in their actions.\r\nIn our view, the United Nations is not a police \r\nforce acting to avert conflicts between States. The \r\nStates Members of the United Nations must submit \r\nthemselves to the norms of international law, to \r\njustice and respect for human rights, as well as strict \r\nrespect for those standards. Consequently, they must \r\nwork towards peace, stability and the development of \r\nnations.However, today it would appear that the law of \r\nthe strongest and the most astute prevails, a situation \r\nthat naturally leads to rebellions, which could lead to \r\nterrorist movements.\r\nWe believe that the success of the United Nations \r\ndoes not depend on the skill of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly or of the heads of United Nations \r\norgans, or much less does it depend on the intelligence \r\nof the Secretary-General. Many of the denunciations \r\nmade against the actions, purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations happen on a daily basis, \r\nwithout those leaders being in the least concerned, \r\nbecause they feel that their interests lie above those of \r\nthe principles of the United Nations.\r\nThe results are before our very eyes: the large \r\nnumber of wars and conflicts that give rise to refugees \r\nand concentration camps and the massive migrations \r\nof people loking for a place of refuge in countries that \r\nhave a degree of stability and economic prosperity. The \r\ndrop in the price of oil and other internationally traded \r\ncommodities has a negative effect on the economic \r\ndevelopment of producer countries. That is the result \r\nof the pillaging recorded in the countries that have \r\nfallen victim to armed conflicts, the natural resources \r\nof which are being seized as trophies of war. Certainly, \r\nwe are reaping the bad fruits of our own negative \r\ndestructive action, and that is not in line with the aims \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nEquatorial Guinea is a small African country \r\nthat survives thanks to the cautious approach of its \r\nGovernment, the good graces of its people and the \r\ncooperation and solidarity of friendly countries. We \r\nhave suffered attempted invasions by mercenaries, \r\nsupported by weapons-producing Powers who had \r\nno other aim in mind than to take control of our oil \r\nresources. Fortunately, however, the preventive and \r\nprecautionary measures that we took put an end to \r\nthe schemes of the aggressors. Not satisfied with that \r\naggression, our country is now subject to a systematic \r\ncampaign of unfounded accusations concerning human \r\nrights violations and abject poverty. We are not ashamed \r\nto denounce those accusations here, because the \r\nRepublic of Equatorial Guinea is open to the world and \r\neveryone is familiar with our successful achievements \r\nin sociopolitical development.\r\nWith the programme adopted by the United Nations \r\non the Millennium Development Goals having come to \r\nan end, Equatorial Guinea is pleased to have achieved \r\ngreater levels through the implementation of the Goals. \r\nEquatorial Guinea’s Development Plan — “Horizon \r\n2020” — sets out the following goals: to build \r\ninternational standards of basic infrastructure in order \r\nto improve productivity and speed up economic growth; \r\n15-29568 27/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nto strengthen human capital and improve the quality of \r\nlife of our citizens; to build a diversified economy based \r\non four sectors, energy and mining sector, fishing and \r\naquaculture, agriculture and livestock farming, and, \r\nfinally, the service sector; and to establish quality \r\ngovernance at the service of the citizen. Success thus \r\nfar in the implementation of that programme made \r\nit possible for us to achieve the priority Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWith regard to the reform of the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, Equatorial Guinea reaffirms its firm \r\ncommitment to the African Union position, based on \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration, \r\nconsisting in the demand for two permanent seats and \r\nfive non-permanent seats on the Security Council, with \r\nall the obligations, rights and privileges that those seats \r\nentail.\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the Governments of the United States of \r\nAmerica and the Republic of Cuba for the restoration of \r\ndiplomatic relations. We ask that this culminates in the \r\nlifting of the embargo against Cuba.\r\nWith regard to climate change, Equatorial Guinea \r\nfully shares the concern of the rest of the international \r\ncommunity, namely, that the very existence of planet \r\nEarth is under threat. In order to combat this everyone \r\nshould contribute according to their abilities to arrest \r\nthis phenomenon. That being the case, the Amazon \r\narea, in South America, and the Congo Basin, in \r\nCentral Africa, which constitute the world’s lungs for \r\nthe preservation of the environment and biodiversity, \r\ndeserve special attention at the upcoming twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nParis.\r\nI would like to conclude by expressing our \r\nwholehearted willingness as a State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations to contribute to all processes that \r\nwould help to improve the functioning of this world \r\nOrganization. We wish this session of the General \r\nAssembly every success.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, \r\nfor the statement he has just made\r\nMr. Teodoro Nguema Obiang Mangue, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Miro Cerar, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Slovenia.\r\nMr. Miro Cerar, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Miro \r\nCerar, Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Cerar (Slovenia): We are at a historic junction \r\nfor the United Nations, which will turn 70 next month. \r\nThis occasion is an opportunity for stocktaking of the \r\nOrganization’s past achievements, missed opportunities \r\nand challenges ahead. The United Nations has been \r\nmaking outstanding efforts in paving the road ahead \r\nfor peace, security and human rights. At the same \r\ntime, profound changes have taken place in these seven \r\ndecades. The United Nations has been successful in \r\nadapting to some, whereas it lacked creativity, political \r\nwill and f lexibility to effectively face others.\r\nTen years ago, leaders met here in New York with \r\na vision to increase and promote international security \r\nand advance human rights and development with a \r\nbold plan known as the 2005 World Summit Outcome \r\nDocumen, which led to the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council and Peacebuilding Commission. We \r\ncollectively endorsed the concept of the responsibility \r\nto protect human beings from mass atrocities and \r\nsystematic violations of human rights. We have \r\nalso committed to reform the Security Council, as \r\nwell to revitalize the General Assembly, as part of a \r\ncomprehensive, overall reform of the Organization. \r\nThe United Nations has to continue to adapt to new \r\nchallenges, and it would therefore be important to \r\nmake progress in that respect. We have the mandate \r\nand responsibility to act, based on global solidarity \r\nand the vision of a fairer and more secure international \r\ncommunity.\r\nWe welcome the adoption of the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda and of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). However, by the end of \r\n28/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nthe year, at the twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change Conference, in Paris, we will need \r\nto adopt an ambitious, durable, universal and legally \r\nbinding climate agreement that addresses mitigation, \r\nadaptation, financing and technology development in a \r\nbalanced and cost-effective manner.\r\nSlovenia remains strongly engaged in protecting \r\nthe environment and in ensuring its sustainability, \r\nboth in national and international contexts. Based \r\non our extensive experience with beekeeping, and in \r\nview of multiple threats to bee populations, we wish \r\nto raise awareness of the critical importance of bees \r\nfor sustainable food production and biodiversity. The \r\nSlovenian Government therefore decided to propose the \r\nproclamation of “World Bee Day”, for which we will \r\nseek the endorsement of the United Nations.\r\nThere can be no security or economic and social \r\ndevelopment without respect for human rights, and vice \r\nversa. I wish to express our support for the excellent \r\nwork of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights, Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein, and to \r\nencourage him to continue to exercise his leadership in \r\nthe field of human rights. Almost a quarter of a century \r\nago, when Slovenia gained independence, respect for \r\nhuman rights was a pivotal founding principle of our \r\nnewly formed State. Since then, our commitment to \r\npromoting human rights, especially by protecting the \r\nmost vulnerable groups, including children and the \r\nelderly, has intensified and represents one of the core \r\nelements of our foreign policy. Slovenia will continue \r\nto advocate a progressive approach to human rights \r\nissues and strive to enhance international norms and \r\nstandards. We are confident that we can also successfully \r\ncontribute to that goal by serving as a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council from 2016 to 2018.\r\nThis year is particularly significant for women, since \r\nit marks the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the \r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action. Just a few \r\ndays ago we participated in the event commemorating \r\nit and reaffirmed our commitment to gender equality, \r\nhuman rights and the empowerment of women. And in \r\nOctober we will mark the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), \r\nthe first resolution to stress the role of women in peace \r\nand security. But while we acknowledge the progress \r\nthat has been achieved, our quest for gender equality \r\nmust continue.\r\nRespect for the rule of law and international law \r\nis an essential condition for nations’ development and \r\npeaceful coexistence. One of the aims of the United \r\nNations, enshrined in its Charter, is that of working \r\nto establish conditions under which justice and \r\nrespect for the obligations arising from treaties and \r\nother sources of international law can be maintained. \r\nSlovenia believes firmly in the paramount importance \r\nof international treaties. It is through them that we can \r\nenhance universality, ensure reliability and provide \r\naccountability. Every society should make justice, truth \r\nand reconciliation a major focus and strive to attain \r\nthem by every possible means, including international \r\ncourts and tribunals. We continue our strong support \r\nto the International Criminal Court, which plays an \r\nimportant role in affirming the rule of law. Slovenia \r\nwill continue to advocate for a strong and independent \r\nCourt as well as for the universality of the Rome Statute \r\nand the Kampala amendments, and we call on States to \r\ncooperate fully and promptly with the Court. But the \r\nprimary responsibility for prosecuting international \r\ncrimes rests with States. Slovenia is actively engaged in \r\nefforts to ensure mutual legal assistance and extradition \r\nagreements between States for crimes against humanity, \r\nwar crimes and genocide, through the initiative in that \r\nregard.\r\nTime and again, no matter how often we insist that \r\nmass atrocities and systematic violations of human \r\nrights should not be repeated, we still witness events \r\nthat shock the conscience. In the past few years we \r\nhave witnessed war in Syria and raging conflicts in \r\nIraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Gaza, Yemen, South Sudan, \r\nthe Central African Republic and elsewhere, with \r\nspillover effects in their immediate neighbourhoods \r\nand consequences felt around the world. Such situations \r\nhave been worsened by the escalating violent extremism \r\nand crimes committed by Daesh and other terrorist \r\ngroups and organizations. This must be stopped. We call \r\non the Security Council, and its permanent members in \r\nparticular, to overcome their divisions and find a way \r\nto deal more effectively with the deteriorating situation, \r\nin line with the Council’s primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nNor has Europe as a continent been spared. The \r\nconflict in Ukraine goes on and its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity remain under threat. We therefore \r\ncall for the full and timely implementation of the Minsk \r\nagreements.\r\n15-29568 29/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nThese wars and conflicts have dramatically \r\nincreased the displacement of people on a large scale, \r\nreaching levels unprecedented in recent history. We are \r\nfaced with immense humanitarian challenges. Refugees \r\nand migrants are f leeing their homes in massive waves, \r\nand hundreds are dying in their quest for a better life. \r\nThe magnitude of the current humanitarian crisis \r\nrequires a determined and immediate response on the \r\npart of the entire international community, based on the \r\ncommon principles of solidarity, humanity and shared \r\nresponsibility. We should help these people in need. We \r\nshould increase assistance to countries that are hosting \r\nlarge numbers of refugees. We should also act more \r\ndecisively in refugees’ countries of origin by pushing \r\nfor sustainable political solutions to ongoing conflicts \r\nand by countering the spread of radical ideologies.\r\nSlovenia is committed to conflict prevention and \r\npeaceful conflict resolution. Wherever possible and \r\napplicable, we should opt for diplomacy, mediation \r\nand conflict prevention. The recent historic agreement \r\non the Iranian nuclear issue proves that even the most \r\ncomplex issues can be resolved peacefully. Considering \r\nthat positive outcome, we hope that the Middle East \r\npeace talks will also resume soon, with a view to \r\nbringing stability and security to this tormented region.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWith regard to disarmament and arms control, I \r\nwould like to welcome the early entry into force, last \r\nDecember, of the Arms Trade Treaty and to call for its \r\nfull implementation. That will enable us to regulate \r\nthe international arms trade effectively, and thus make \r\na substantial contribution to international peace and \r\nsecurity. My country also remains committed to the \r\ngoal of a world without nuclear weapons.\r\nI would like to conclude by underlining that \r\nSlovenia will continue with activities aimed at bringing \r\nthe global community closer to achieving universal \r\nstandards of human rights and a decent life for all. We \r\nwill remain a strong supporter of an environment in \r\nwhich every human being can feel safe. We will continue \r\nto advocate for strong partnerships, inclusive dialogue \r\nand constructive cooperation. We are determined to \r\nwork with all partners to ensure that the Organization \r\ndelivers tangible, meaningful results that can advance \r\npeace, security and human rights for all. Slovenia will \r\ndo its share in shouldering its responsibility to act.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Miro Cerar, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Meltek Sato Kilman Livtuvanu, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Meltek Sato Kilman Livtuvanu, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Meltek Sato Kilman \r\nLivtuvanu, Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Livtuvanu (Vanuatu): Vanuatu is honoured to \r\njoin previous speakers in congratulating the President \r\non his assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session, and I would like \r\nto assure him of my delegation’s full support. Under \r\nhis leadership we are confident that he will guide us \r\nsuccessfully through the session. I would also like \r\nto offer warm thanks to the previous President of \r\nthe Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa. His \r\nexemplary leadership has produced many important \r\nachievements that will continue to shape and strengthen \r\nthe United Nations and enable it to execute its mandate \r\neffectively.\r\nWe are meeting today at a critical crossroads in \r\nhistory that presents us with a unique opportunity to \r\nchange the lives of millions of people around the world, \r\nespecially the most disadvantaged, for the better. The \r\n2008 world financial crisis dramatically changed the \r\nglobal financial landscape. The banking crisis resulted \r\nin unprecedented unemployment and low economic \r\ngrowth around the world. The effects of the financial \r\ncrisis are still being felt, and the recent volatility of the \r\nglobal financial markets has created further uncertainty.\r\nApart from that global economic challenge, we are \r\nwitnessing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis caused \r\nby conflict and violence. According to the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\nthere are currently more than 60 million refugees in \r\nthe world, a number unequalled since the Second World \r\n30/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nWar. Climate change continues to be a major challenge \r\nfor the world generally, and a major threat to small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) in particular. Its impact \r\ncannot be understated. The rise in sea levels and the \r\neffects of El Niño and unfavourable weather conditions \r\npoint to a bleak future for humankind.\r\nThe uncertain global economic outlook, the adverse \r\nimpact of climate change and the humanitarian crisis \r\nmean that the task ahead of us in implementing the \r\nGoals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) is all the more daunting. That stark \r\nreality calls for immediate collective action. If we do \r\nnot resolve this global crisis today, we run the risk of \r\ncreating a world with no prospect of sustaining peace \r\nand security. For the world community, that blunt \r\nreality calls for global action to ensure that peace, \r\nprosperity and security can continue to be maintained \r\nin the future. That is the most important gift we can \r\ngive our future generations.\r\nI welcome the theme of the General Assembly’s \r\nseventieth session, “The United Nations at 70 — the \r\nroad ahead for peace, security and human rights”. It is \r\ntimely and relevant to our current global development \r\nchallenges. Peace, security and human rights are the \r\nmutually reinforcing pillars of successful sustainable \r\ndevelopment and consistent with the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. This \r\nyear we are celebrating the 70 years of the existence of \r\nthe United Nations, and on reflection, we can see that \r\nmuch has been achieved. We have experienced no major \r\nwars so far; millions have been lifted out of extreme \r\npoverty and remarkable progress has been made on \r\nthe human rights front. Despite those achievements, \r\nhowever, significant challenges remain ahead.\r\nThe humanitarian crisis that has resulted from the \r\nconflict and violence of recent years has revealed a dark \r\nside of humankind, a world of haves and have-nots. \r\nThe major Powers must do more to assist the surging \r\nrefugee population, and I urge the most financially \r\nable countries to seriously consider donating to the \r\ncoordinated Humanitarian Programme Cycle of the \r\nUnited Nations. What we need now is to address the \r\nunderlying root causes of such conflicts — extreme \r\npoverty, hunger, the lack of good governance, a lack \r\nof adherence to the rule of law, poor economic growth, \r\nrising inequality and youth unemployment. Sustained \r\nand inclusive development is therefore extremely \r\nimportant to preserving peace, human rights and \r\nstability around the world. I commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s approach to addressing this humanitarian \r\ncrisis from a human rights perspective.\r\nIn the light of these global challenges, the role \r\nof preventive diplomacy as a key instrument in the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security around the world is \r\ncritical. Women’s role in this area should be enhanced, \r\nand we should focus most of our efforts on preventive \r\ndiplomacy. Vanuatu will always play its part in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, and our \r\ndeployment of peacekeepers to Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti \r\nref lects our commitment to that endeavour.\r\nAs part of the international community’s response, \r\nwe have embarked on three important and ambitious \r\nglobal agendas, adopting the 2030 Agenda and the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda, as well as drafting an \r\nagreement on climate change to be concluded in Paris \r\nat the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \r\nlater this year. The 2030 Agenda promises to be \r\ntransformative, particularly for those at the margins \r\nof society. While the Millennium Development Goals \r\ncontributed immensely to human progress in areas \r\nsuch as gender equality, extreme poverty reduction \r\nand improved access to basic social services, there is \r\nroom for more to be done. The 2030 Agenda covers a \r\nwide range of areas that are pertinent to my country’s \r\nsustainable development and a good complement to our \r\nnational sustainable development aspirations.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 14, on the conservation and \r\nsustainable management of oceans and seas. For too \r\nlong we have observed the decline of the health of the \r\noceans and seas as evidenced in dying coral, a profusion \r\nof marine pollution, damaged coastal ecosystems, \r\ndeclining fish stocks and ocean acidification. We \r\nrecognize the need for a framework within which the \r\nimplementation of SDG 14 can be progressively assessed, \r\nbenchmarked and driven forward for the duration of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\ntherefore support mandating the proposed triennial \r\nUnited Nations conference on the oceans and seas as \r\nthe driver of progress evaluation for SDG 14.\r\nI am delighted to see that a focus on gender remains \r\nan integral part of the 2030 Agenda. Achieving gender \r\nequality in my country, given our tradition and cultural \r\nmakeup, continues to be a challenge. However, the \r\npolitical will to continue to advance women’s interests \r\nremains steadfast. We have made notable progress \r\n15-29568 31/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\non women’s access to basic education and health \r\nservices and their assumption of leadership positions \r\nin municipal councils, and today women have better \r\naccess to basic financial services than ever before. As \r\none of my country’s leaders, I want to see more tangible \r\nprogress made in the advancement of women and girls \r\nand their active participation in national leadership. \r\nThat can be expedited if more financial resources \r\ncan be made available for helping my Government to \r\nadvance gender equality and women’s empowerment.\r\nThe success of the 2030 Agenda will depend on \r\naccess to affordable financial resources and appropriate \r\ntechnology and on substantially improving national \r\ncapacity. Regarding access to financial resources, the \r\nrecently adopted Addis Ababa Action Agenda reflects \r\nmost of the pertinent issues, and it is important for \r\nus to implement it swiftly. I join other global leaders \r\nin calling on all developed countries to meet their \r\nofficial development assistance (ODA) commitments, \r\nas agreed on in the Monterrey Consensus and the Doha \r\nDeclaration. The ODA target of 0.7 per cent of gross \r\nnational income (GNI), as well as the increased target \r\nof 0.2 per cent of GNI to least developed countries \r\n(LDCs) by 2020, must be met, for they are crucial to \r\nrealizing the 2030 Agenda.\r\nDevelopment financing initiatives through South-\r\nSouth cooperation are complementary to this and will \r\nremain critical. On that note, 1 would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the President of China, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Xi Jinping, for his recent announcement \r\nat the SDG Summit (see A/70/PV.7) that China will \r\nprovide $2 billion to developing countries. That type \r\nof gesture and goodwill demonstrates real action and \r\ngenuine partnership.\r\nAccess to technology is critical to the achievement \r\nof sustainable development. I welcome the United \r\nNations initiative, launched in Istanbul, aimed at \r\nestablishing a technology bank for least developed \r\ncountries. My Government would greatly appreciate \r\nits speedy realization. In the area of technology, and \r\nparticularly the development of information and \r\ncommunication technologies (ICT), Vanuatu has made \r\ntremendous strides in recent years. Our efforts were \r\nrecognized last weekend when Vanuatu, along with \r\na small number of other countries, received a United \r\nNations award for ICT evelopment, thus demonstrating \r\nthe transformative role that ICT is playing in improving \r\nour people’s lives. It will continue to be a key tool for \r\nus in our implementation and achievement of the SDGs.\r\nRegarding improving country capacity, I urge \r\nthe United Nations to assist developing countries, \r\nparticularly SIDS and LDCs, in developing their \r\nstatistical capacities. For small island developing States, \r\nthat remains a challenge and, as we know, it is the most \r\nimportant basis for formulating evidence-based policy, \r\nas well as assessing progress on the 2030 Agenda.\r\nFor small island developing States such as \r\nVanuatu, climate change remains a major threat to our \r\nachievement of sustainable development. I am therefore \r\ngrateful to see that Goal 13 of the 2030 Agenda \r\nhighlights the importance of climate change. However, \r\nwe should note that this Goal can be meaningful only if \r\nwe reach a favourable agreement in Paris in December. \r\nThe connection between climate change and sustainable \r\ndevelopment is clear. If we do not address climate \r\nchange, SIDS cannot achieve sustainable development. \r\nIn March, Vanuatu experienced a category-5 tropical \r\ncyclone that affected 60 per cent of the population and \r\n64 per cent of its economy. According to our current \r\nassessment, it will take many years and more than \r\n$500 million to rebuild our economy. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the international community \r\nfor its swift response in assisting us immediately after \r\nthe cyclone hit with disaster relief and operations. We \r\nlook forward to its continued support for our recovery \r\nand reconstruction efforts, which we have just embarked \r\non.\r\nOur Pacific island leaders have continued to voice \r\ntheir concerns about climate change in regional and \r\ninternational forums. We are calling for a legally binding \r\nagreement limiting the increase in the average global \r\ntemperature to well below 1.5°C above pre-industrial \r\nlevels and for anchoring loss and damage provisions \r\nin the agreement. We are also calling for a financial \r\npackage that will commit countries in the UNFCCC’s \r\nannex I category to providing $1 billion a year by 2020 \r\nin order to finance our adaptation and mitigation needs. \r\nThese declarations represent our collective voice in the \r\nlead-up to the Paris Climate Change Conference and \r\nour call to ensure that the planet is saved for us and \r\nfuture generations.\r\nApart from focusing on climate change, we have \r\nalso agreed to strengthen regional connectivity, improve \r\nproductivity and boost economic growth to ensure \r\npeace and security in our region, all initiatives that \r\nare consistent with the 2030 Agenda. The relationship \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Pacific-based \r\nregional organizations is critical to the implementation \r\n32/33 15-29568\r\nA/70/PV.20 30/09/2015\r\nof the 2030 Agenda and the SAMOA Pathway. We \r\nwelcome the recent adoption of resolution 69/318, on \r\nthe relationship between the secretariat of the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum and the United Nations, and we hope that \r\ncooperation can now be translated into concrete action.\r\nMy delegation would like to remind the United \r\nNations not to lose sight of decolonization issues, in \r\nthe light of the emerging challenges that have been \r\npresented to us to address collectively. Vanuatu calls \r\non the United Nations family to remain equally focused \r\non finding ways to address this long-overdue issue. The \r\nUnited Nations membership must bring closure to its \r\nwork on decolonization. The right to self-determination \r\nhas been a fight endured by many generations. While \r\nmany have lost their lives in the process, the dream \r\ncontinues for the United Nations and all nations \r\nadvocating and promoting the democratic principles \r\nthat still linger in the hearts of many, in the hope that \r\none day their cries will be heard and the promise of a \r\nself-determined future delivered. The United Nations \r\nmust continue the work of the Special Committee on \r\nDecolonization in order to maintain a meaningful \r\ndialogue on the question of New Caledonia. We thank \r\nthe Government of France for its cooperation in moving \r\nthe decolonization process forward. It is therefore \r\nimportant that all parties maintain a dialogue and \r\nensure that all the issues are addressed.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nPresident Barack Obama’s recent decision to re-establish \r\ndiplomatic relations with Cuba and reopen diplomatic \r\nmissions between the two nations. We hope the process \r\nwill be completed soon with the lifting of the embargo \r\non Cuba.\r\nLike other small Pacific island countries, Vanuatu is \r\na small, open and vulnerable economy. Its openness and \r\nsmall size mean that it is highly vulnerable to external \r\nshocks and that opportunities to exploit economies of \r\nscale are limited. Despite those challenges, we have \r\nbeen able to record economic growth for the past 10 \r\nyears. The recent impact of Tropical Cyclone Pam, \r\nhowever, has erased the gains made over that decade. It \r\nwill take many years to recover, making our efforts to \r\nachieve sustainable development somewhat daunting. \r\nAs a result of this difficulty, my Government recently \r\nmade a decision to request the United Nations to \r\nconsider postponing our graduation from LDC status \r\nfor some years. That will give us ample time to recover \r\nfully from the effects of the cyclone and rebuild our \r\neconomy. I urge the membership of the United Nations \r\nto support our draft resolution on the matter during the \r\nAssembly’s seventieth session.\r\nMy Government and people will work to mobilize \r\ndomestic resources and ensure that our institutional \r\ncapacity is geared to meeting the new development \r\nAgenda. Like many other developing countries, we \r\nacknowledge that we cannot achieve our sustainable \r\ndevelopment plans alone, and we therefore call on the \r\ninternational community to help us achieve those goals.\r\nMy Government believes that the ongoing tensions \r\nbetween the issues of the freedom of the seas and \r\nterritorial claims has placed the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea and other relevant \r\ninternational conventions under huge pressure. \r\nHowever, I also believe that States must be willing to \r\ncooperate and seek peaceful solutions to any disputes \r\nthat may have arisen. Umaenupne and Leka islands, \r\ncommonly known as Matthew and Hunter islands, \r\nsouth of Vanuatu, have been a repository of our cultural \r\nheritage since well before the colonial era. As in the \r\nother 83 islands, people would use the freedom of the \r\nseas to visit their claimed cultural sites. For several \r\ndecades now, my people have been denied their right \r\nto enjoy the freedom of the seas and their claimed \r\nterritory. I would like to thank and commend the United \r\nNations and the Republic of France for their willingness \r\nto hold a dialogue and allow my people their right to \r\nvisit their claimed territory to perform cultural rituals. \r\nThe Government of France is to be commended for its \r\nimportant role in advocating for the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples in our region and around the world.\r\nI would like to place it on record that Vanuatu has \r\ndeclared the two islands and the water surrounding them \r\na cultural and marine protected area. Cultural visits to \r\nthe island will be undertaken to revive and empower our \r\nindigenous and cultural system. I also wish to put it on \r\nrecord that the Government of Vanuatu will strengthen \r\nits ties with its French counterpart in collaborative \r\nefforts to ensure that our ocean is safe from terrorism, \r\npiracy, climate change and illegal fishing.\r\nIn conclusion, the global challenges before us \r\nare overwhelming. The global economic uncertainty, \r\nthe impact of climate change and the unprecedented \r\nhumanitarian crisis at hand remind us that we need \r\nto think differently and adopt innovative approaches \r\nto resolve those challenges. We need to deviate \r\nfrom business as usual. That is important especially \r\nwhen implementing the ambitious 2030 Agenda for \r\n15-29568 33/33\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.20\r\nSustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda and the soon to be adopted Paris climate change \r\nagreement. What we need are revitalized partnerships, \r\ninternational cooperation and collective wisdom to \r\naddress those challenges. When we stand together, \r\nthere is no limit to what we can do together.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Vanuatu for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Meltek Sato Kilman Livtuvanu, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.40 p.m.\r\n"
